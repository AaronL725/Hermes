Volume Price Level Trading Volume is a popular tool among traders, but most look at volume over time. When you plot volume against price scale, then a completely different picture emerges. There are prices that have a large amount of volume and prices that have much less volume. Volume Price Level Trading is not new, in fact it is as old as futures trading or even the stock market itself, long before computers existed and the only ticker..well...was a ticker tape of price and volume. Many argue in Forex that volume is a meaningless indicator because it only indicates a broker's volume. There are two problems with that argument. The first is that why indicators even work, is that they extrapolate historic price data and then traders use this information to make trades which affect price action. Second, volume is not an indicator. Volume typically leads price and is the only tool that doesn't extrapolate historical numbers (i.e. what the market did) to determiene a result. Volume is price action. The effect on price is that high volume tends to be attracted or work within a price range around a price level. High volume is high market interest in a price level, low volume is low market interest in a price level. The market mans that for every buyer there is a seller. Forex is not random price moves. Price moves because someone is selling and someone is buying at a price. The more popular a price for buyers and sellers, the more volume. Volume in Forex is a broker's tick volume data from it's own database. This means that volume is a record of every trade, 1 trade, 1 volume. Volume is not the quantity traded. The reality of Forex is that everyone sees the same price, everyone uses the same indicators and why volume works across brokers is that the market makes the same decisions, regardless of which broker they use. The end result, is that at each price level the volume increase or decrease is relatively the same at any broker because the market interest is the same at each price level. This has been proven time and time again, by traders using multiple brokers, comparing brokers, by using multiple broker feeds, and so on. Volumes will not be exactly the same, but their relative movement to price will be the same. A price level is like a magnet, price candles are iron bars attracted to the magnet, and volume is the magnet's strength. The stronger the price level, the more attracted price is to it. Price will bounce around a strong price level and be difficult to move off the price level. Try to move an iron bar that is attached to a magnet...very hard to move, but once the iron bar moves away from the magnet, it is a lot easier to move. When a price level is weak, there is nothing to hold price at a fixed level and prices can move more aggressively and quicker. Iron bars will easily pass by weak magnets, but when they hit a strong magnet they will stick. Trades in the market are largely pre-determined. There is a price level where buyers and sellers will gather. This means that if you watch price and volume, you are not looking at what has happend in the past, you are looking at where the market is headed. Once you find a strong price level, you can trade to and from that price level knowing that price will be attracted back to that price level. Volume Price Level trading is not a system in a traditional sense. It is reading the markets. However, many moves with price/volume are repetitive and predicatable. What can never be forgotton is that we trade price levels, we are looking to where price is most attracted too.

This is a MT4 chart with volume indicator added on the M15 time frame. You will notice I have made the volume chart one colour as I think seeing different colours for the rise and fall in volume only confuses matters. I've also added a level line on the volume indicator at 500. This is an arbitray line I use just for reference to ignore the volume noise below this line. If trading on M30, I use level 750 and on H1 it is level 1000, in case you are wondering.

So let's read this chart from December 31, 2012. As you can see at around 8:45 am there was a huge spike in price upwards, a leveling off and then a sharp down turn at 10:45 am and then another climb right afetr that to the end of the chart. So, from this chart we could have easily taken advantage of the downturn and the following rise simply by establishing price level lines from the data staring at us.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Let's focus on 8:45 am. This is where we see a huge spike in volume, which means that price crossed a line that "triggered" a large amount long trades. This we will call the "Volume Trigger". The "Volume Trigger" is created at the close of the candle, we never make decisions midway through a candle. Determining the price that caused this "Volume Trigger" is the tricky part. Volumes are fairly level prior to this "Volume Trigger" at 8:45 am and as such I put the price line above the opens and closes of candles previous. I looked back to 3:15 am where the volume made a small peak. We can see where I drew the "Price Level Line at Trigger" and we can see how the volume from 3:15 to 8:45 reacts to this line. I will write more about this later as it is very intuitive for me to see the "Price Level Line at Trigger" but there is a very analytical approach to this that can be used to establish this line. I also look for simple prices that are ending on "5" or "0", in this case at 1.3195 -- we'll never be exact and it is good practice that we typically use the "5" and "0" price levels when setting a price level. So at this point we know have established that their is a price level line at 1.3195 and this has triggered a buying spree in the market. From 9:00 to 9:30 we can see that volumes have declined and the price has pretty much maxed out at the top of the chart. So after the 9:30 candle closes, I put my sell order in at the 1.3222 and waited for my order to go through, which it did. My stop is at 1.3230, a little higher than the highest price reached since the "Volume Trigger". My exit target is simply at 1.3195 where the "Price Level Line at Trigger" is set. This is a simple set the trade and forget with my broker. However, better strategies to maximize the trade and exit by volumes and price do exist for in the moment trading. If you paid attention you can see my error where I set the "Price Level Line at Trigger". I set it at 1.3222 and at 10:45/11:00 we have proof by the volume spikes that the real price level is at 1.3220. Notice my error? I should have stuck to the "0" price level at 1.3220 and not 1.3222. In this instance it did not hurt me, but trade opportunities can be missed by a simple mistake like this - small as it may seem. Also at 11:00 we have a new trigger and price level line to establish for a long trade. The safe level is at 1.3185 or 1.3190. I'll let you ponder that for now and see if you can figure out why that's a safe entry point for a long trade. And where would you exit? It looks so arbitrary and simple doesn't it? It is and it isn't. Obviously establishing the correct price level line is the challenge and my hope in this forum is to show you how to dtermine that price level line; not just by instinct but with some logic and analysis so there is no emotion or second guessing in your trading and that you are making pips all the time...and not hitting those dreaded stops!

I am with you on this

Subscribed. Thanks for sharing Spudfyre and happy new year to you.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Subscribed. Is this the standard level for all other pairs besides EURUSD?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
It is an interesting concept you have there, but I was just wondering how do you know that price has maxed out and is about to go back to the initial price level line at trigger. Could the price just not consolidate and shoot up again? Do you look at specific price action to determine that price will reverse or is it just what price usually does after such volume rise ? Anyways, thanks for sharing, looking forward to see how this thread will develop

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I will talk about it more but basically you just want to set your volume indicator level line to mentally block the volume that isn't of interest, i.e. it is too low and numerous to give any indication.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
It certainly can happen and that's were some other tools come in handy, like my post on older Escalator to Pips forum that uses multi-time frame stochastics so we know where we are in the trend. Even at that, I'm fundamentally not a risk taker, so stops that are hit, don't pull me down overall too far. When we are fluctuating near a price level, that duplicity of a long indicator triggering another long indicator will hit our stop. This is much of the longer thread, so keep watching...we'll definitely dive into this issue.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hey Spud, Nice to see you around and active again. I've actually always been curious about the proper utilization of the volume indicator because I have heard that many of the professionals always talk about it especially in a lot of articles and such that I read but I've never actually figured a value added way to utilize it. So, with that said I'm definitely tuned in as I know you will have some innovative and interesting stuff to offer here and I'm always open to learning something new.

Trading and Some Pitfalls There are definitely some pitfalls to watch out for and knowing these and measuring our risk/reward will go a long way in keeping us profitable. Let's look at the next chart and our "Volume Trigger", you can see the volume before this was almost non-existent and relative to that on Dec 30 18:00 we see a peak. This is definitely a cautionary trade with volumes this low overall for an extended period and our peak just rising above 500, but it's a good lead into a pitfall so we'll use it. You can see if we set our price level at the trigger at 1.3205 (remember the "5" and "0" rule) that 1.3205 seems too low and out of place...really stretching the low limit of price. Using a "Price Level Line at Trigger" of 1.3210 match are volume chart and price history much better. Price jumps up and we see volume die off 3 candle periods after our trigger. So now we set our sell order at 1.3230 and our stop at 1.3235. You can see how we came to the determine the stop line? 1.3230 is above all the previous high prices on this chart (except one candle), it ends in a "5" (5,0 rule) and it is close enough to our sell order that if we hit our stop we really won't get hurt. So risk to profit ratio looks pretty good with our exit being 1.3210.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Now, let's look at the pitfall looming ahead. We just made a great short trade and we get another trigger on Dec 30 21:45, coincidentally the same candle our exit was hit on the previous trade. We can see that our price doesn't rise very high and the volume drops after the trigger. Our "Price Level Line After Trigger" will be the same as our "Price Level Line at Trigger" of 1.3210. Why? We can see the volumes have dropped 3 candles after the trigger and we have seen no significant long price move. If we put the price level after the trigger at 1.3215 there is no previous price level reached in previous candles that support it. Now the pitfall. If we set our short order at 1.3210 this we know is a trigger value for longs, so extremely risky. Our stop could find a place at 1.3220, Personally, I don't like it but a case could be made for it, certainly no lower. Our exit in this case will run purely on a volume trigger. That's 3 red flags for a risky trade and we should avoid it. Better to sit and watch and wait until overall volumes are better. A riskier trader might take their earnings from the previous trade and set their stop at that level...so at worse they break even. Short order at 1.3210 and exit on the volume trigger that eventually comes at 23:45...it's a great trade in the end. However, that volume trigger could have been to move the price in the opposite direction...so watch out for this pitfall. We'll definitely revisit many trades similar to this and as a holistic trading strategy examine the pros/cons of entering these type of trades and how to stack the odds in our favour better.

ke them your explanations are not clear. very confusing. not sure what the exact rules are. it would be helpful to just summarise the rules.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I promise I will summarize the rules and guidelines after I introduce the topic. Volumes and Price Levels are powerful when used together and consider the introduction the safety course. I want people to trade successfully and know why they are making their decisions. If I'm unclear and you would like a better explanation in anything I write please let me know what and I will definitely look to rewrite and make it easier to understand. It's just the beginning and a new and difficult topic to write about, so I am no doubt going to have some clarity challenges ahead of me.

Hi spudfyre, great thread. At this moment I´m volume trading fan. Suscribed and waiting for more

--- 帖子 #17 ---
hi spudfyre , thank you for this thread and i just want to see if got it right here an exemple on eur/usd we had a volume spike at 1:30 am so price level line at trigger is 1.3265 and price level line after trigger is at 1.3285 so we will short from 1.3285 with stop at 1.3295 targeting price level line at trigger http://i.imgur.com/b7cmc.png

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Yes, the overall concept is correct. I might differ with you on price levels. I'd prefer at price level at trigger of 1.3260, just because we saw no volume for the price to drive below 1.3255 just previously (around 23:00). I'd like a stop at 1.3300, I think it is less likely to get hit...1.3295 might get tested or just touched. I like the 1.3285 entry, making the risk ratio good(lose 15:gain 25) -- the risk ratio allowed me to set the stop higher and a stronger reason go with a higher stop. Just a point - I'd double up my short order right after the 3:00 candle...notice the spike in volume and the lack of response in price. That's another trigger but our price levels would not change and we'd be looking at the same trade entry/exit. It's just a bonus we should take advantage of. You spotted a great trade!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I like volume and I have it on my charts always however my trading decisions are not based on them.Challenging part is volume increase is simultaneous with pa and by the time you "see" volume increase move is done. Furthermore just because volume peaked and temporarily decreased does not mean there is no second wave coming in same direction of original spike. Anyway I am always open to learn. Regards

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Subscribed, even if the whole concept it is unclear, but sounds interesting. Please explain a little bit more in detail how do you determine the price level line after trigger. Good luck with your thread. Thank you for your effort to share.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I only trade and make the decisions after the candle closes. I never make or base a technical decision on an open candle. If I want an earlier peak or entry, I use a lower time frame like M5 and trade on the M5 closed candles. I'm big on multi-time frame technical analysis and trading. Did I say never...ok I cheat once in a while..and usually pay the price. Yes, there can/will be second waves, which is why our stop ratio is always lower than our earnings ratio. It is unlikely (not impossible), we will ever encounter a succession of second waves. In other words, we are trading, expecting to lose a few, but always gain overall.

Hi Spudfyre Interesting thread, looking forward to reading more. I have just sketched this out on MT4 to help me understand some of the sequence, thought others may find it useful, hope you don't mind me posting it. Marshy

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Many Thanks for teaching us to interpret the volume indicator. I'm subscribed and look forward to learning from you. jesse

Hi Spud! Great to see you back! Current situation on EU. A long set up. Entry would be at 1.3100. Exit 1.3130... applying the 00/05 rule. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1.3095 seems to hold judging from the high volume on the down bars which are unable to move price lower. The close is well off the candle lows which reflects buying activity.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
i tried your last multi-stochastic multi timeframe system some time ago. didnt work out, as altough all time frame stochs lined up, market still moves in opposite direction resulting in stopouts....too many of them. are you still using that system ?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
How do you interpret volume when you have more than one volume bar?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Let's go through what we see everyday in volume and price levels. First, let's forget the word volume as it is a technical term. Instead we will use the word INTEREST. Peaking volume means their is INTEREST and low volume means their is no INTEREST. INTEREST in what? Price level. IMPORTANT : Volume and price levels is not about predicting or forecasting where the price is moving too. Instead it is about knowing where the price levels are to enter a trade when a price level is reached, and exiting a trade when a price level is reached. We order and enter a trade when price hits a price level, in the direction of interest, and set an exit where interest will fade. I will now show you.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Let me explain INTEREST. VOLUME = INTEREST The chart below on the left side seems pretty simple. Volume is rising and price is rising, which means buyers are bidding up to sellers in order to purchase (demand). Interest is high and somewhere along here we have crossed an important price level. I've set it at line "A" on the chart (1.3200). We can see where INTEREST is lost in the price. Somewhere above line "B". We don't know exactly where but we have a reference point, I used 1.3275 as the price level since we have a drop in volume above this price level after a volume peak. So entry for a short would be at 1.3275. In reality this is a bit of a gamble, because we only know from what we see that buyers loved the price at 1.3200 and lost INTEREST above 1.3275. But our risk reward ratio is quite high. Our stop would fall around 1.3300, our entry at 1.3275, and our exit at 1.3225...that's 2x earnings vs a stop loss risk. At this point we have hit a volume peak 5 candles from the left of the chart (our TRIGGER). For 2 candles after the peak we saw volume drop and price climb. So INTEREST in this price higher level has faded. At this point we are pretending we have no previous price and volume history except what is on this chart, so our trade entry here is the typical "I think price is going that-a-way". We have discovered 2 price levels from INTEREST, but that is far from really knowing anything concrete yet.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
As we progress we can see where the vertical lines are drawn on the chart that volume is rising and we see the largest price movements are down. The first price movement simply reinforces that INTEREST in price level is still not above our horizontal line B. The price movement and higher volume means that INTEREST is in price going down. Buyers are purchasing as price drops. Between vertical line "2" and vertical line "3" price drops and volume falls and as volume continues to fall, price starts to rise. Again no INTEREST in a higher price and lines 3 &amp; 4 almost peg our upper price level. The high volume (INTEREST) here is anticipation and buying that because price is moving to cross the upper price level (or has crossed, since we don't know exactly where it is) that price may jump. This just further reinforces that our "B" price level line is close to where it should be.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Lines 5,6 and 7 are all peaks of volume (INTEREST) and where does the interest lay? Not in price going up, there is INTEREST in selling at this price level. And now things will get interesting.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Now, notice how the INTEREST changes at lines 8 and 9. Higher volumes and price going up. This is a market change and sets a brand new price level at horizontal line C which is 1.3250. This price level is crystal clear if you take a look back at where price stopped falling between lines 2 and 3, as well as after line 6. This price level is not random. Look back further to the 4th candle from the left side of the chart....remember there was interest in price passing a price level and now we found it. The market has changed, so either their will be INTEREST in the price going higher, or the price going lower. We simply have no clue at his point in time. The safe play here is exit our trade, but it is still sound to stay in our short trade for now as we are far away from our stop.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
The INTEREST simply remains at this price level one candle after vertical line 9 and then as price rises past our new price level again their is no INTEREST at this price level. Our "B" price level is once again verified as a no INTEREST price and buyers don't want to be buying at this price. Now, we have our trade. This is the real deal, and simply a ride from 1.3250 to 1.3200. Why? We know that there is absolutely no INTEREST from buyers at either the 1.3250 or 1.3275 price levels. We know that the market changed and our original "B" price level at 1.3275 has dropped to 1.3250 at the "C" price level. Since there is no INTEREST in buying at these levels, there will be an INTEREST (volume) peak coming and like peaks 2, 6 and 7 it will be sell because our price level still exists at 1.3200. Vertical line 12 is not a surprise, it is fully anticipated because that is where the INTEREST is.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
So what exactly are the rules, look for high volume, wait for low volume to come in, see if price will continue to move higher with low volume and then look to short? vice versa for a sell? So from your pic and depiction, your looking for low volume to determine where you are gonna put your stop? I understand what your saying but I wanna make sure Im understanding thethought process in analyzing volume, cause like other guys on here, using it and making sense of it has always eluded me. I would love to get my head around interpreting it.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Sorry if you already answered.I could not find it. You wait 15min candle to close to make your trading decision? Which TF candle is your trigger candle. Reason I ask it makes huge deference in entering the trade.On your chart 15canndle #12 is roughly 20pips.Had you waited to close that candle you would of missed good chunk of the move. From Price Action perspective #11 candle should of been a good signal. Anyway I am more interested how you make your entry decisions. Thank you

--- 帖子 #35 ---
How would interpret these volume bars? see attached pic

--- 帖子 #36 ---
What we are establishing are price levels. Then looking for where the interest is in those price levels. It isn't as simple as saying we get a high volume, followed by a low volume and we do..... Volume and price work together so when price at an interesting level, trades happen. Crossing price levels will trigger trades in the market. Stops are where there is little/no interest in a price level, not to far from our entry, and our risk/earnings ratio is pro earnings.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I'll start to spend more time on the practical side of trading and dcisions behind it. Closed candles or different time frames. Yes, you can miss moves in open candles, but my experience is that I make a lot of bad decisions trading open candles. Closed candles mean more to me, and I have remained constant in that. The way around open candles is to trade shorter time periods, or look at shorter time periods for an entry. So, if you are using M15, but want to trade part way through an open candle, drop down to M5 and see if it supports your decison. I wrote a lot about multi-time frames in MTF Stochastics and Escalator to Pips in these forums. I use stochastics routinely, but that's just my preference when using an oscillator indicator.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Could you interpret how one would go about interpretting the volume on the chart that I posted?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
The volume peak (in white); prior to that there is a red volume bar that peaks, there is a crossing of a price level there (establishing a new price level on this chart), but the interest is not strong in the price climb. When the price turns down and volume goes up just before the white peak, we cross the price level and there is far more interest in the market with price gong down. We would be entering a short order at this new/existing highest price level and exiting at the next lower price level. I've drawn "rough" price levels where the volume (INTEREST) is being supported. After the big drop 3 price levels are established, follow the volume valleys closely and you should be able to see how the price level interest is being established. At the end of this chart their are 2 spike volumes with climbing price. At quick glance and looking at price at a whole it looks like interest is less on the final price climb but the green line is actually interest in a higher price. It's may be hard to see and put together, but remember it is where the INTEREST is, and the interest (volume peaks are supporting a climb) and that higher green level. If that final candle is closed and the volume closed at that level, I'd be putting a long order in where my green arrow is at the middle price level, looking for price to rise back up to the highest price level. This is a very tough trade and requires really paying attention to details in the volume/price moves.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
As the forex market is decentralized, we can't have exact value of volume. This volume will vary from broker to broker. So, the performance will vary depending on brokers, won't it? How do you define this term? If you please explain then it will be better for understanding.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Though the exact volume levels will differ from broker to broker the relative levels remain remarkably consistent. A very high or low volume bar from one broker will almost always be reflected as a very high or low volume bar from other brokers. OTC FX volume bars are also consistent (relatively speaking) with FX futures volume. Why does this happen? Doesn't really matter to me. I just know it does. Check out the many VSA threads here for endless examples or download several demos from different large brokers and compare. There are minor differences to be sure, just as there are often minor differences in price from broker to another but, generally speaking, they all show the same thing -- the same relatively high or low volume, increasing or decreasing volume, etc.

Hey spudfyre, keep the info coming!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yes, I second that, very interesting...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hey spudfyre, how long have you been trading this way?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This is old stuff. I've always used it...not as a system but to read the charts. Single most powerful trading tool you will ever have in your arsenal. This goes way back to reading tapes and trading without home computers...and I'm really not that old! It still as relevant today. I've certainly modified it over the years from use and experience. I've had far more success focusing on finding market price levels, than focusing on more narrow price action. Last 3 years, have been the most success using price levels...probably because I really put a focus and dedication into reading the charts this way, had the time to focus...and moved away from the more (easy and lazy?) use of indicators. This causes far less trading stresses and I can enter and walk away from trades, instead of living in front of my computer. Now, trying to write it down into something meaningful for others to use...this is a first attempt at that challenge. BTW: Yes, I still play with stochastics.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I see. Do you think you could pull up a chart, make a video of it in real time as you are making your analysis? It could even be in hind sigth, but maybe verbally speaking about what you see and how one is suppose to look at and analyze a chart maybe of greater help to everyone who is viewing the thread. It seems like it a thought process and the mind has to get trained in that way. You do a lot of typing to get your point accross. Maybe video dictation will get out a lot more than typing and posting charts. You could post the videos on here or get a free youtube chanel and post them on there so we could watch and guys could come back to the thread with questions. I have always wanted to implement volume into my trading and I know lots of other guys on here would love to utilize it as well, I know its a powerfull tool if it is understood. Its all just suggestions. I know its not easy to put into words as to what your thought process is, every scenario will be different, thats the thing about trading, its a forward thinking game. Gotta always study the move before you make the move.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I was thinking the same thing. I'm a little worried it may take longer to produce than I think...just have to try it I guess. But yes, I think I'd save a few thousand words typing.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Spudfyre. I find your topic intriguing but I need to clarify what I am reading with your intended instructions so I can follow into more advanced understanding of your method. Please see pic below "I looked back to 3:15 am where the volume made a small peak."... "We can see where I drew the "Price Level Line at Trigger" and we can see how the volume from 3:15 to 8:45 reacts to this line." I see no individual small peak at 3:15am. Did you mean 3:15 or is it somewhere else? Reaction to that line actually started at 12:45am I believe? "So after the 9:30 candle closes, I put my sell order in at the 1.3222 and waited for my order to go through, which it did." I assume this was a market and not a limit order? "Also at 11:00 we have a new trigger and price level line to establish for a long trade." "...and at 10:45/11:00 we have proof by the volume spikes that the real price level is at 1.3220" I see no Volume Trigger spiked at 10:45/11:00 - am I missing something here? Isn't there supposed to be a volume spike to have a trigger? Where is the spike? Thank you very very much for your thread and your time.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Ok excellent (for me anyway) I understand up to here very well now. Thank you for this enlightening explaination, I'll continue to watch your unfolding of this method before experimenting with it. I'm still a little unclear how you decide on the Entry Line Levels. TJ

spud still waiting for a clear explanation of the rules .....

Price Level Rules 1-7 Establishing Price Levels Price levels are what we trade too. Our first task, BEFORE we trade, is too establish some price levels we can use for trading. First we simply need a starting point a little ways back. If you are an active trader, once you start you will simply maintain your chart with the current price levels on it. A more casual trader will have to go back in recent time and find the current price levels. Here is how we do it. Rule 1. Price and Volume are one thing. Never believe that price moves without volume or that volume moves without price. You will never understand one without the other. The only thing your need on your chart are price candles and the Volume indicator (I use MT4 Indicators, Volume, Volume). Rule 2. Volume = Interest. Never call volume "volume". This will only confuse you and means absolutely nothing. "INTEREST" on the other hand means something...as in "INTEREST IN PRICE". I mean how interested the market is in price. Rule 3. Trade on Eur/USD M15. This is the easiest currency to trade and usually costs you the least in spread. We use M15 because for one it is the most affordable time period to trade for the small investor (i.e. reasonable stop losses, risk, earnings, etc.) and the other reason is we can utilize M5 and M30 in more advanced topics to be even better traders to confirm M15. Oh ya, and you thought this would be simple...and yes you don't have to trade in multiple time frames to be a success --- but it is more fun! Rule 4. It doesn't matter where we start, but we have to start somewhere and not too far back in history when establishing our first price level. This is open to how much work you want to do before you enter your first trade of the day. It is also subjective to how confident you are in the price levels you establish. I recommend at least 12-24 hours back and if that doesn't feel right try 24-48 hours. Too far back and you are just wasting your time (i.e. 7 days is way too far back). You want something that gives you a good starting point as we discuss in Rule 7. Rule 5. The First Price Level We Establish Will Be Our Weakest in Confidence, the Last Our Strongest Our first Price Level will be determined with only 1 or 2 sets of data, our last should have our full confidence and have been derived from all relevant data available. Keyword here is "relevant" - see Rule 4. Rule 6. Price Level Price's Always End in "5" or "0". This is a "pshyco-logical" price level, well written about and explored. It's real, it exists, why fight it? I simply will never explain or justify this rule. It is what it is...pshyco but logical. Rule 7. "Scanners On Spock!" - Detect the First Price Level See chart below...please note this is not a trade set up Find a good clear spike (Peak A) in volume with a large (or largest) price action (candle). See red vertical line "A". Go back a little in time and find another spike (Peak B) with some decent price action that falls within your first selection - this is to help narrow our price level range. See green vertical line "B". By "falls within" we mean that the price candle is in the same range as our first candle, the two should cross the same price level. The price level is hiding between the two horizontal dashed lines "C" and "D". In this example, the high price of the second candle at vertical line "B" is is the top range of our price level (line "C") and line "D" is the low price of that candle. That's easy to see by the range of volume earlier and the price level set before Peak "B". -- YES! Pick data that is easy to read to start your trading day with. "Our first Price Level has been detected at 1.3145 captain!" How did we pick 1.3145? Three simple reasons - Our price level's price must end in "0" or "5" and if you look carefully at the rising interest (volume) before the second peak at line "B", we know this price is much preferred over 1.3140 by the price candle activity. Thirdly, between line "A" and "B" our price climbed above 1.3145 and then when it peaked at line "A" it fell through 1.3145. You can develop other reasons why 1.3145 is supported over 1.3140, you need some sound reasons to pick a level. Consider this first price level a very well educated guess and trade accordingly fully aware of the risks of trading a very well educated guess. You can trade on it, just don't get cocky! Confused? Ask for Price Level another way? What price cuts through 2 candles with the highest volumes near each other? What is happening before and between these two candles with price and what is volume doing (i.e. lower) between these 2 candles?

I'm having trouble reconciling your words with your chart. Joe

--- 帖子 #53 ---
(" before the second peak at line "B" ") I think that means second peak at line D

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I made changes in the rules and chart to add some clarity. But to answer your questions: Does this mean that the low level must not be lower than the first candle selection and the high level must not be higher than the high selection? No. They simply both candles must cross the same price. If both candles cross too many price level options (say both candles are very long), then it will be too hard to find the price level we are looking for. You need to refine your search and look for price/volumes that give you clarity. Remember what we are trying to do here -- we are trying to let price/volume show us a price level. We need "relevant" data to start. Be picky, find data that tells you something. Where exactly is the peak you are talking about here? (" before the second peak at line "B" ") I can't seen to pinpoint a 2nd peak, what peak? See chart Peak B

--- 帖子 #55 ---
No. Price and volume are one. Line D is the upper price level range (the highest our price level can be) given the volume data. It is in this example, the highest price of that candle found in vertical line "B". Hopefully the "Peak B" label on the chart now helps.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
But the confusin is that you stated: Thirdly, between line "A" and "B" our price climbed above 1.3145 and then when it peaked at line "B" it fell through 1.3145. But price never rose above 1.3145 to fall through it did it? Is this what you ment? What am I missing in the literal example you gave?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I'm so sorry! "when it peaked at line "A" it fell through 1.3145" is what it should read. Thanks for catching that.

Rule 7 Step By Step - Step 1 Let's just say I want to start trading tonight, and never traded before. In order to trade I need to find some price levels to trade too. That way I can enter my orders and exits. First, I need to establish a fairly confident price level with little data available to me. This is an initial reference point that I will start from and be able to watch how the price/volume (PV) moved after this point. When, I finally reach the current market time, I'll have price levels set up, know how price is moving and be ready to trade. So first, I need a clear initial price level and this is how I find it. I start by looking at the chart and not going too far back in time to find a nice clear volume spike (peak) that has a large candle with it (price movement). In the chart below I find one, call it Peak A and draw a red vertical line ("A") as a reference on the chart. Now let's understand what is happening on this candle and what has taken place earlier in time from this red reference line on the chart. Prior to the Line "A" the volume was low and price fairly flat, when price crossed some unknown value then the floor fell out of the price and the price took a big drop. This one candle at line A crosses a price level. It's a price level, not THE price level. This is one of hundreds of price levels that exist at this point in time, but we can't see any of them so we need to find one the market is trading on. All we know at this stage, is that their is a price level in the candle we picked. The candle is large and has many price levels from 1.3145 down to 1.3110. We can't possibly determine a price level to use with this many choices. So, we found a nice big candle with the highest volume up to this point in time and now we need to find another reference point to narrow our price level range.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Rule 7 Step By Step - Step 2 Alright, we've established a reference time in space to try and find a price level. At this stage we have nothing but a price range of the candle (it's hi and lo price) and that this price range had the most volume for some time. So, we need to go back in time on the chart and grab some more data. We need a point in time where the same rules applied to Step 1. Find a high volume peak (spike) with some large price movement. The only catch is that this candle's hi/lo price must be in the same price range as our previously chosen candle's hi/lo price....not all of it, just some of it -- the less the better. Vertical line "B" is drawn at such a point in time. We have a volume spike and we have a price candle in our previously chosen candle's price range. The closer in time to our first step's reference line the more relevant our data. However, it is also helpful if we have a few candles between our two volume peaks as this will tell us much more information, then them being side-by-side. So, now we have a green and red reference line on our chart. They simply point to 2 large candles in time with peak volumes. What we now know is that for some reason the market has an interest in these to candles more than any other for some time. It almost always points to a price level (line) drawn in the sand by traders where buy/sell orders exist and where traders will launch a trade. Or, you could even say all the indicator systems may have used this price level for some decision. What we don't know is what that price level is yet. But we now have a price range. Not bad from 2 candles in time.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Rule 7 Step By Step - Step 3 Now remember, our 2nd smaller candle chosen holds all the same results as the first candle we chose in that we have a hilo price range in a volume peak that means a price level exists i the second chosen candle somewhere. The advantage now is that our 2nd candle has a much smaller range. So we simply draw a hi and lo price line from this 2nd candle to establish a hi price level limit and a lo price level limit. Call them lines "C" and "D". The only relevant of this hi/lo price range is the portion of lines "C" and "D" that cut through our first candle. Note: I have simplified the price level range selection for the second candle to simplify the explanation. We could complicate the 2nd candle's data range by reading the volumes prior to vertical Line "B" with much greater detail. For now, it is unnecessary. Ok, at this point in time we have established a price level hi/lo range where the price level can be found. So let's find the price level.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Ok great... the only clarification I need is on this statement. When you say the less the better, do you mean it would be best if most of the candle stuck out above the price range and or below with only a partial amount of it inside the range of the original price candle range? Thus creating a greater opportunity for a larger TP ? Thanks Spudfyre

Wow! Been away from FF for a few weeks and what a surprise to see you back! Your Stochastics threads have been so informative. Unfortunately, my Broker shut down so I do not have a live account at the moment, but still look forward reading your new thread.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Rule 7 Step By Step - Step 4 We know that our price level MUST end in "5" or "0" as we except no other values. Now we simply want to find the price level that fits our chart the best, based on the price candles at line "A" and line "B" and falls within the price hi/lo of line "C" and "D". We could simply arbitrarily put the price level line as close to the middle of the price range meeting our price end rules of "5" or "0". OR We could study the price/volumes closely, especially between our two candles to determine how those prices were affected by our yet to be established price level line. OR We could use any number of our favourite indicators or systems to help establish our price level line. Really, it doesn't matter too much as long as our price ends in with "5" or "0". I chose 1.3415 because it made the most sense based on price/volumes between my 2 candles. Remember we have just established a price level, not THE price level. Our price level isn't a guess. In fact, with amazing ease and simplicity (if you have understood this so far) has been to establish a price level that is very real and meaningful. It's not THE prize level, but of the hundreds that existed in this historical period at this price level, ours had some of the most interest in the market. The chart below shows our very first price level line placed on the chart. This price level is a reference tool to start with. We are going to trace this price level and find more new price levels as we progress closer and closer to our first live trade for the day (remember we started from nothing). By the time we get to our first trade for the day, our price levels will have enough data to be extremely accurate. Stick with it. This will get ridiculously simple once you follow along for a while.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yes you are correct. A reduced range intersecting our first candle into our second candle simply means we will have less options for our first price level.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Awesome! I'm ready for more when you are. Joe

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Joe, slow way down. We are not setting up a trade yet. We are just finding our first price level, so that we can find other price levels until we are current to the market...and then we can trade. Price levels will tell us where the market is and where to set our trade.

Price Level Rules 8-9 Establishing Price Levels Once we have our first price level established we then want to move forward from that point in time and establish a few more price levels. Rule 8. Locate Price Levels To Open Market This is a lesson in reading the price and volume chart. Devil is in the details. Remember we are establishing price levels based on sound reasoning of the price/volume relationship. Rule 9. Price Levels Fit Like Lego The price/volume relationship establishes a price level, so it is natural that the price level we add to our chart will fit. The chart below is the location of the next price level that we found in the Rule 7 example. The devil is in the details.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
From the chart included with Rule 9: Vertical Line "A" is the volume peak and price movement we started with to find our first price level using Rule 7. Price Level 1 at 1.3140 is the first price level we found in our Rule 7 example. Vertical Line "B" is the next logical volume peak with a large price movement. Peak A and Peak B are relatively close to each other and at Peak B our candle is somewhat larger than the rest between line "A" and "B". More important our next price level sticks out like a gold filing. Stick a price level line through the candle at vertical line "B" (it must end in "0" or "5"). I chose 1.3100. Now look at how the candles between Vertical Line "A" and Vertical Line "B" cross this price level --- NOW LOOK AT THE VOLUMES for these candles! Do you see every time the candle crosses our 1.3100 price level there was volume movement. Details - it is not huge volume differential, it is though noticeable for the consistent raise in volume across 1.3100. Where the candles move off this 1.3100 price level between vertical lines "A" and "B" the volume drops. So, simply put there is interest at 1.3100 and less interest off this price level. Now, we have 2 price levels established -- and we still ARE NOT using these to set up a trade!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Moving forward on the same chart. Vertical Line "C" at volume PEAK C is simply a confirmation of our Price Level at 1.3100. There is nothing here to indicate any new price level. So added confidence that 1.3100 is a solid price level.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Now keep following the chart along and I think it is extremely easy to see how the next fall in price occurred and how easily it is to read it coming, even if we know about it. The chart below shows the next PEAK D with major price movement at Vertical Line "D" IMPORTANT POINT - we have established earlier that 1.3100 is our price level line that the market is interested in. The price has been hovering above 1.3100 and the interest shrinking between vertical Line "C" and "D". So, this can mean that price action will occur when the price crosses 1.3100 and our bets are the price will drop. WHY? Devil in the details. Look at the candles that cross the price level at 1.3100 between lines "C" and "D". NOW LOOK AT THE VOLUMES! All of the interest is at 1.3100 and there is no interest above this price level. In practice when we see this occurring live we would have an open short order prior to vertical line "D". We found the 1.3100 price level and when it crossed the markets made a move and that's we want to be a part of. I'm hoping this looks like a ridiculous simple and easy way to make some dollars because it is. Just read the charts. So, lets keep going so we can catch up to the open market and put this into practice.

Let's jump a little closer to what it is like to use Volume Price Level Trading (VPLT) in real trading. Using the chart below and a few that follow, we'll pretend the candlestick on the far right is the last closed, this way you can see how VPLT decisions are made on the run in active trading and we should come up to the real time market very soon. So in previous examples, I've shown you how we have chosen vertical lines "A" through "D". So after vertical line "D" we are looking for a new price level to set to capture the lower end price of trading. Look at lines "a", "b" and "c" between Peak D and PEAK E lines. The candle at line "a" is the first lowest volume (interest) price range we cross after PEAK D. So at this point in our head only (not in the chart) we will draw a price level line at 1.3060 to act just as a reference point in our mind that we have crossed some price threshold. The candle at line "b" continues to fall and volume (interest) has increased, so we now know that market interest is still towards a lower price after our reference of 1.3060 and picking up as we draw away from this price level. The candle at line "c" is the lowest volume now to this point in time. This pretty well conforms we have a price level somewhere between 1.3050 and 1.3060 and at this very point we'd likely pick either 1.3050 or 1.3055. We choose 1.3050 if we want to use the rock bottom volume price to this point, and we use 1.3055 if we just want to pick the average price level between 50 and 60. Now we are at PEAK E (the red vertical line), the last closed candle we see. It is a peak at this point to us. The volume has started to increase after the price crossed 1.3050 so our new price level will be put on the chart at 1.3045 (not yet seen). When live trading VPLT, our locating of a new price level will be dynamic from candle to candle until we approach a peak that locks and confirms the price level. Don't panic along the way that you are missing some great opportunity for a trade, just because price passed a price level and you had no entry. With VPLT you will have oodles of opportunity for trades, so don't rush to enter any trade trying to "catch up". Just pay attention to the devil in the details and follow along.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
One candle forward and we see our PEAK E remains, and our price level stays at 1.3045. Now our last candle was long, trying to move price back up from below 1.3045 to 1.3045. Interest (volume) is less for price to move back up to 1.3045, so this is where we would want to enter short at 1.3045. I'm using 1.3045 as a short entry for ease of clarity, but you may find it more beneficial to actually open and close trades on the "4","6","9" or "1" price. You need to watch how your broker responds, or if you trade live, you don't have to sit there for the entry to be exactly 1.3045. The point is we are entering a trade short somewhere close to 1.3045. In this mode, where I have no definitive lower price level below my trade, I'm trading for 20-30 pips. I'm trading live, and if I do find a lower price level that's my exit, or 20-30 pips. My stop then must be lower than 20-30 pips and if you remember we had an "imaginary" price level between 1.3050 and 1.3060, I'm opting for 1.3060 as my stop...15 pips. I don't like my stops too tight.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Jump ahead a couple of candles and I'm feeling really good about this short entry. The candle has hit (climbed to) our price level of 1.3040 and the volume (interest) is not in the market to go up pass this price level. My short trade is on!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Let's keep going... OK, so price is now dipping, volume is up and we may have another volume peak forming. Here it is "no guts, no glory". You could pull out of this trade and make 15-20 pips. That is a safe money making option, and anyone who knows me would know that I'd be yelling at you to get out of the trade, because if you can make 20 pips a day everyday, you are in command of your Forex financial future. However, I know the odds are hugely in my favour that price will keep going down, if I get a peak here or very soon and volume diminishes if price rises. The only thing I'm now risking is a 5 pip loss as I drop my stop down to 5 pips above entry. You can see we have a possible price level here because we may have a peak. Right now this price level is just a reference, but I put it on the chsrt for you to see. Do you see how this price level may be formed? Well first this candle and volume will need to become a peak for it to be a true price level. We know when price came down to this level volume (interest) increased, and when it moved up away from this level volume (interest) went down. So right now this price level at 1.3030 has some market interest. It is just as plausible that the price level may be 1.3025, I've just chosen 1.3030 because it seems to fit better in my mind. It is arbitrary what you choose....sorry we just can't be exact and end of day, 5 pips really is the fudge factor and trust me, really doesn't come into play that often.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
A couple of more candles forward, price goes up, volume goes down, we have a new peak "F" so our price level sticks and I put it at 1.3030. We know exactly what will happen now do we not? Well I'm still in my trade if that tells you anything....short trade....hint.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hello Spudfire. I read a few of the posts and your reasoning logic. In your first or second post you mentions that " The volume indicator shows us everything, the secret is interpreting that information to determine the price level.." What exactly the volume indicator shows? ... real volume traded in futures market? ... or the volume number of ticks in the bar? Would help to know to follow your reasoning/logic of interpretation. If it is the future's volume I have always wonder if the volume of futures increases because the price of the spot start to move fast, in other words the business world cover themselves to secure a price if the price moves fast in any direction. Plus We all know that whoever sell a future contracts they buy the net on the spot market. Therefore the volume increase of the contracts, most likely, would be a consequence and not the cause of the move. It the indicator is just a a tick counter, how can we tell if really shows some kind of "interest" for a currency? I mean, more ticks, is just more ticks and "could" be associate to money volume traded, but also "could" be associated with lack of volume traded. Can you please elaborate what the indicator really shows? J.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Probably I should recant that and say the price and volume working together shows us everything. I was assuming the price part with the original words when written. It really doesn't matter what the volume indicator shows. It's relative. As long as it stays consistent with price movement, that is what matters about the volume indicator. And then probably no one likes that answer who read it. Ok, let's assume then for a minute that every trader, buyer and seller of Forex is generally working towards entering their trades on the same relative price actions. If that is true, which I find it is, then as long as you treat volume and price action as one single indicator, then it all works. There is a very fine line to cross indeed to start using the volume indicator alone, without looking at what price is doing. My logic behind the volume and price together is to find price levels and verify where they are. I suppose I, or anyone could use any number of other indicators to do the same but I find since it is so easy with volume/price together, why use anything else? Ultimately we are trading price levels, not volume. If volume is not working with price it shows up fairly quick becuase the price levels will not, nor will volume/price show you any price levels that work. I've never seen the problem arise, and it is consistent. So ultimately as long as I have consistency, I'm happy. Volume is probably a broker's ticks, like I said doesn't really matter. Price/volume are going to move on market interest but volume will move relative to itself with price...so even if it is associated with less money volume, that less money volume will be relative to price. That is why the life span of price levels is short and they are constantly dynamic. Volume peaks with price movements will mark a price level...and that relativity before and after is consistently current with price action...regardless of what volume really measures. Technically, something like the stochastics (or any oscillator) indicator has the same issue. The movement of an oscillator is relative to the current price action be that 5 pips or 100 pips...the oscillator doesn't care how many pips, just how price moves relative to itself and where the oscillator is. You can set price levels with an oscillator, get the same results as you would with the volume indicator -- but oh, is it painful to do compared to using price/volume.

Makes a hell of a lot more sense now that you have explained it in steps. good job Bro! First person I have seen that broke down how to read volume. It makes sense, if you think about it, where there is high activity, there is a price level that traders are looking at to buy and to sell and it could only be spot with volume, wether it be tick volume or not. I just used your analysis on a 5 minute chart and it worked, scalped for 10 pips. Keep it coming, seems simple now that you explained everything. How did you learn to use volume that way?

Volume Price Levels is developed from the old "read the tape" process we traders used long before home computers were at our disposal. I date myself, but in the "old" days the most efficient way to trade was with price and volume. VPLT is grown out of that and a great deal of time I've spent with stochastics. The methodology you see here is the volume/price side of a more defined stochastics tool I've been developing over the years. However VPLT is a very strong tool as I have realized on it's own, whether that is simply by accident in applying stochastics thought to it, or I've subconsciously have done what I wanted to do and just don't need the stochastic portion to be as visible as a separate indicator as I previously thought. Anyways, I've been extremely happy with the results.

I don't trade to win, I trade to earn. If you apply this right, then you should be able to trade with confidence and earn money consistently from your trades. How many trades you win, won't matter as much as how well you can trade and manage your bank roll. VPLT earns me money consistentoy, so does stochastics trading. To me that is all that matters. Consistent pips. Now you've asked for it, so I'm going to unleash my never ending rant: "IT IS NOT HOW MANY PIPS YOU EARN, BUT WHAT EACH PIP IS WORTH THAT COUNTS AND KNOWING YOU CAN EARN THOSE PIPS, RELIABLY AND CONSISTENTLY EVERY TIME YOU TRADE IN A DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME" - Spudfyre

long on eur usd...i also took a short late last night...I think its all coming together to make sense from the step by step outline that you have outlined spud as they are very precise and detailed...but although both trades worked out nicely I still feel I might be doing something wrong here...would you be able to cover some of your "interest level" analysis from today...

--- 帖子 #94 ---
But the reason for my long entry was it seemed as though from looking at volume...that there was an interest in price to be higher than 1.3035 and 1.3025 so I went long...and price is still going up and I'm trying to find a level for reference but there still seems to be an interest in price being higher...I'm wondering if I'm at least on the right track with this...I will have to see when I get a drop in volume to signify a loss of interest to get the level to use as a line in the sand but we are currently at 1.3100 so this might be it as a major round number...

Just a word of caution - I have not explained everything yet. If you are trading this for real, I suggest not yet. Practice on finding price levels and trade entry/direction, but not live trades yet. Let me get through this. It's a lengthy subject but we are getting there. One thing you want to establish are price levels for the market at least 12-24 hours in advance of where you trade (i.e. go back in the chart a bit). The more diligence you put into examining what the market is doing prior to trading and understanding it, the easier it will be to set yourself up for trades (successful) moving forward into your trade day. Next round of examples I'll start as a normal trade day and go through some trades as I did them. I'll start as if I have no prior knowledge of the market conditions. After that, I'll be glad to look at your trades and be glad to help. (I don't want to start yet, as I may answer your questions with the upcoming info). If you want to try and set price levels for the 7th, I'll be glad to review them if you are stuck or not confident. It might be interesting to see how much variance we get with several people setting price levels for a day. Trust me once you do this for a few days, you can pop price levels up in just a few mins....it is super easy, just watch the devil in the details.

VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 1. Go back in the chart and find 2 clea r volume peaks in the volume indicator. I have marked them on the chart below as Peak A an d Peak B. The red vertical lines "A" and "B" run through 2 candles. Our first price level runs through these candles.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 2. Our price level must end in " 5" or "0". The range of the first candle on vertical line "A" is be tween 1.30669 and 1.30719. Th ere is only one possible price level that cuts through this candle at 1.3070. The first price level is found. Drawn on chart. The candle at Peak B (vertical line "B") also cuts through our first price level. This price level is confirmed. T hings to notice: After Peak A, the price jumps up to 1.3085, but there is no interest ( vol ume) at this price level. As the price starts to de sc end towards Peak B (vertical line "B"), the volume picks u p, until price crosses our price level at vertical line "B". This is a very confirmed price level. Note in your mind that interest (volume) picked up as price de sc ended across our price level. Just note it, it doesn't mean anything yet.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 3. Peak C and Peak D are our next 2 cl earest interest (volume) peaks. We are picking clear defined peaks to establish price levels before we enter a trade. We can be choosy about how clearly defined our peaks are at this stage. Finding the price that cuts through the candles at vertical line "C" and vertical line "D" requires reading the interest in price (through the volume/price relationship). T he devil is in the details.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 4. We know the price level must intersect both candles at vertical line "C" and vertical li ne "D". I have maked where the price level will fall between by 2 green dashed lines on t he chart. Sine price levels end in " 5" or "0", we only have 2 possibilities for our new price level; 1.3045 and 1.3050. These are the only price levels that fi t our price level rules.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 5. Read the price /volume relationship between vertical lines "C" and "D". Each time our p rice moves away (up) from 1.3050, interest (volume) decreas es. Each time our price moves closer towards (down) to 1.3050, interest (volu me) increases. Therefore 1.3050 is clea rly a new price level. When the price crosses 1.3050, the price drops a nd creates PEAK D at vertical line "D"

--- 帖子 #102 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 6. Very important concept here. At Peak E, verti cal line "E" we will yet again establi sh a nothe r price level at 1.3035. You can see how I got that by reading the price / volume movement away/t owar ds this price line . It should be clear as day. Price a way (up) volume weakens, towards down voluem strengthens. Look at the details. DO NOT read each candle indi vi dually . Read the price movement/volume to ge ther . See it? Now look at all our peaks and look at what price did at each of them. At each peak price has fallen through our pri ce levels.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 7. When price climbs from vertical line "E" we are watching the interest volume c limb to the price level we found at 1.3050. When price climbs across (o r nears we don 't have to be exact) we are entering out trade short at 1.3050 and our stop at the next higher price level 1.3070. Why? Why am I not going long? Well we can anticipate that our interest (volume) is peaking and since every other peak so far has resulted in price cr ossing down it would seem the most logi cal play to go short. It is possible the market changes direction and goes up and then we simply hit ou r stop and lose 20 pips. It is ours to decide, and I'll go with what the ma r ket has been telling me. Interest in the down pr ice. There is al so one other signal to go down. F rom ou r vertical line "A" to our trade entry you can see 3 distinct price level drops and with each drop there the collective interest (volume) is increasing. Th at would indicate that th e market is far more interested in the 1.3035 price than the 1.3070 price. That 's the trade entry. For exit we have 2 choices. Take our pips when we reach 1.3035 (safe). Go with marker sentiment and expect another price level below 1.3035. You might target 1.30 20 , 1.3010 or 1.3000 , just r emem ber the further you target away from our bottom price level the more risk you are taking. Ideall y, since our stop is 20 pips away, our earnings should be at least 20 pips to make the risk/rewards at least even, so in that regard a n exit at 1.3030 is a good trade target as it is only 5 pips below our bott om price level.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 8. First trade is done if you exited at or above 1.3020. Now price /volume made a new Peak F at vertical line "F". At vertical line "F" we need to be looking for a new lower price level. Reme mber when we opened the trade one option was to follow the p rice down to a new lower price level than 1.3035. The price obviously hit this new lower level and now from the price /volume movement we need to figure out where this new lower price level is. The green price level line for now is just a reference line to examine the price/volume movement after vertica l line "F". As price moves away fr om (climbs), our volume goes down, and when price moves back down t owards 1.3020 the volume goes down? Did the price move down? No, the candle s..all three the price moved u p and away from 1.020 and volume went down. This can be a hard one to see and easily missed.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 9. Let's sa y we miss t his price/ volume move and instead try a price level at 1.3030. You can see that doesn't work. As price goes up towards this 1.3030 level the volume should go up . It doesn't. So , now we've been able to catch our error. Our new price level should be at 1.3020 (if it was at 1.3025 then our volume would have gone up when price climbed to it ).

--- 帖子 #106 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 10. Our new price level is set at 1.3020. Now we k now th at i f price goes up t owar ds 1.3035, volume will go down. We also know that if price g oes down towards 1.3020, volume will rise. So where is the trade entry? Read the above sentence s again. The obvious choice is a long entry at 1.3020. If the price goes up volume will go down so in order for volume to peak again or start to rise our price will have to reach 1.3020. As well, if price goe s down and touches 1.3020 than volume will go up, so no matter how you slice it the trade is at 1.3020. Long? Remember our decision to go short in o ur last trade at 1.3050 wa s because interest (volume) was rising as price rose to this level. Our de cision to go short was to follow the previous market moves where price went down across each price level at the peaks. So now we woul d get another peak if price now crossed down below 1.3020. However, we can't forget that volume rose as price rose to 1.3050 and then after reaching this price level dropped. So that's our target , w e are expecting price to fall to 1.3020 and then climb towards 1.3050 . The other decision of course to go short at 1.3020 can be justified - but we have no data to go be low 1.3020. In our previous short trade, we had data to go below 1.3050. W e have to trade where the price levels are - we don't want to be explorers into the unknown. So, we buy at 1 .3020, set our stop at 1.300 5 and our target exit is 1.3035. Stop was chosen equal to our risk, as close as we can. Putting a stop out in the unknown is risky, so keep the risk reward 1:1 or better. Exit is the first price level , that is safe .

--- 帖子 #107 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 11. W ell th is wasn't the ideal expectation of price/volume m ovement, but we did get our long buy in at 1. 3020. Price and volume rose. This all fits our data and it is not hard to interpret what just happened. Price opened slightly higher on this candle, volume s dropped, price dropped, volumes rose, price h it the bottom price level of 1.3020 w hich was a.........TRIGGER.......and price went up. The volume came when price went down to 1.3020, not on th e way up to 1.3035. Really that doesn't matter. Right at this moment we have a volume pea k, we have to treat this as a volume peak. Which means we need to look at price levels.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 12. Looking at the chart and Peak F and our new Peak, there is no new price level. This peak has only confirmed our thought at trade, tha t interest (volume) is towards the higher 1.3050 price level. Volume is g oin g down bec au se ei ther way price moves, up or down, we will move away from the 1.3035 price level. After that, v olume will in crease if we move toward 1.3050 and should decrease if we move away from 1.3050. There's another long trade here at 1.30 35. Exit target is 1.3050 (upper price level). Stop is 1.3020 (lower price level).

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I have been following along and I think I have understood everything until now. If volume rises as price falls I thought that has been an indication that price will continue to fall and if volume drops off as price rises it means it shows no interest in higher prices yet here you seem to be indicating the opposite. Maybe I am just misreading it but could you please again explain your reasoning to go long here? This has the makings for one of the most infomative threads on FF. I want to be sure I don't miss anything. Thanks.

VPLT TRADE WALK THROUGH J AN 7th-FIRST TRADE SETUP EUR/USD M15 Volume Indicator MT4 1 3 . So, as we expected price is moving towards 1.3050 and so is volume. Here it is a little tricky. At this poi nt in time we have a new peak. We have to ass ume it is a new peak. The net affect is that it creates a new price level 1.3045 . If it is a new peak, than volume will decrease and price will fall. A good time to enter a short trade. If it is not a new peak, then price and volume will rise and we will reach 1.3050. The correct move is to go with what the data tells us now. Exit our trade at 1.3045, and enter a short trade. W e have to trade with what the d ata tells us at the time we know it (end of candle) . So this is effectively a reverse of the trade we j ust made.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Nope, you have it right. As price was rising, volume was falling. Look back at post 104, that might help. If not, the rest of post 106 gave the reason for the switch in direction. Interest was in the lower price level, but just that lower price level. Volume would have increased if price went down...that is as you understand it. The best way to see it unfold is to look at how the price/volume moved later after this. If you take the 10 candles after vertical line "F" and basically pick it up and copy it where vertical line "G" is, then you should see it a little clearer. This is what would have happened if price dropped, the price would have climbed steadily up. The only difference is that at "G", everything would just have dipped lower down in price before climbing back up across 1.3020. So we are expecting that at first price will fall and volumes will rise, and then the turn, where prices will rise with volume. Prices are going to rise because they are headed to a price level of interest...so as price climbs closer volume will go up. Here the higher price level has greater interest than the lower one. Hope that covered it.

Hi Spudfrye, I want to thank you for your kind patient instruction. For a little while there I though my own age may be catching up with me lol but I think I'm beginning to catch on. Please keep up the wonderful lessons... no hurry I like the fact of how through your teaching this is. TJ

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank You Spud for this invaluable lesson. Thoroughly enjoyed it so far. I will now apply these rules and practise reading the price level behavior. Jess

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Spudfyre, thank you so much for sharing! I have great interest in volume trading before that I subscribed on different threads but it was just too confusing so i gave up. Now you came and simplified everything and reignite my interest again. Hope this is my last volume thread to subscribe with. I only need 10-15 pips every day. Thats my goal You are a great teacher with a lot of patience. Looking forward to learn more and master it. Thanks! More power and good health! Btw, I like the devils in details

--- 帖子 #115 ---
As everyone has said already thanks so much for taking the time to go over everything with such precision and detail.....things are making a lot more sense thanks to the time and info that you have dedicated and I look forward to playing around with this a bit more and familiarizing with this myself a bit further through watching and playing around with interest levels and such on the charts as well as seeing your analysis and any additional information that you unveil as this thread develops... P.S. Had a nice short today again which I will post a pic in a bit for you to pick apart..

--- 帖子 #116 ---
That helped a great deal. Thanks. Refering to post 104 was especially instructive. You closed with "This can be a hard one to see and easily missed." It was and I did. LOL.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Nice thread Spudfyre. I've made several attemtps at volume analysis, but could not make it work. Your approach however, does make it more understandable to me. I would like you to have a look at my line of thought from todays session. If, when, you have time. I just wrote my perceptions about price and would like to hear if Im right to a certain degree, what I missed maybe or missinterpreted.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Something else. I'd like to know, if we can somehow judge, that a candle is the initiation of a move or that a candle-volume combination or pattern, can signify a high probability strong move? I've marked candle a and b, both from a short entry level. Candle a had rising volume but resulted only in a mediocre move. Candle b dropped in volume, but it was the initiation of a breakout down. I would have expect it to be the opposite. Could you shed some light on that? Well, probably demand was spent on the lower level, which caused the continuation down, but thats another topic.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Quezoy, Price levels. I think you will see the move a lot better with a price level. It's a pretty easy one to see at 1.3120. Now the price/volume moves should make more sense. There's less interest in price above 1.3120...but. (I apologize if I have the price value wrong, hard to see it on my filthy laptop screen ) Devil in the details. There is another price level above at 1.3130 that is messing with our volumes. Just before candle A our price/voume is climbing and reaching 1.3130. Candle A falls through both price levels, 1.3130 and 1.3120, that results in a volume spike. Next candle price falls away from 1.3120 and interest doesn't wane too much (volume stays pretty flat) Next 3 candles price climbs and volume falls, we cross right up and through 1.3120 price level. So, interest is not in going up over 1.3120. When the next candle drops and volume is up the interest is at price coming down below 1.3120. Getting repetetive isn't it. Here is something really cool! When the price climbs again up past 1.3120 volume fades......and then picks up pushing price towards 1.3130. Now if you are really on your game, you'd be all over this 10 pip climb to go short at 1.3130 or as close to that as possible...this is a pure money grab --- we already established price will fall down through 1.3120. After this cross at 1.3130, there's no interest in price going higher and the bottom falls out at Candle B. At this point we should already be in the trade and riding candle B down or the safe entry if you missed the greed move would have picked up the trade at 1.3120 The rest is just take your pips. You would have another price level lower to exit on or re-assess the downward run. Always trade from/to price levels (or close vicinity) - these are the market targets. Hopefully that added some clarity.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hmmm...didn't get to post the pics like I wanted before closing out the trade but looks like indeed your last break down of yesterdays action was in fact what I needed to solidify the approach on this analysis and seems I was on the same page as you today...so that definitely helps with the confidence of utilizing this volume/price interest technique...

--- 帖子 #121 ---
You so nailed that trade and spotted the sell. You just missed that price level in "no mans land" that you were looking for, you knew it should be there. Remember, price levels fit like lego. Now in hindsight you probably see it clear as day. There's a lot of spikes that would have confirmed the 1.3120 - don't be afraid to try a price level's "fit" and read the volume - especially when you can sense one should be there in "no mans land" and you sense something is missing.

Tnx for the answer. Have to go over it a few times more and digest.

A Live Trade Example EUR/USD Jan 8 7pm EST It is about 6:45pm EST and I'm just setting up for a trade. I've established my price levels (horizontal green lines) using the volume peaks/price candles at the vertical red lines. At this time I'm confident in entering a short trade either off the 1.3080 price level, and if price climbs I'll grab another short trade at 1.3085. The 1.3085 is just extra pips. I put an exit at the bottom price level 1.3065; and a STOP at 1:1 risk/earnings so 1.3105. That stop is really way too high, but I'm really not worried I will hit it. What is happening with price/volume here is that market interest is around the 1.3080. There is some additional interest in price crossing 1.3085, but after that level interest in price going higher is much less. Price moving down through 1.3080 is getting the most interest. So, ideally price will rise above 1.3085 and then fall. My orders are placed at close of 6:45 pm candle - so 7pm

--- 帖子 #124 ---
A Live Trade Example EUR/USD Jan 8 7:00-7:15 pm EST My 1.3080 short order is missed but my 1.3085 is short order is opened when price moved up through 1.3085. I'm a little surprised by the strength of the price move up past 1.3085 but not worried. The interest (volume) rise as price moved above 1.3085 is expected. If I was greedy, I might snag another short order here, but with 2 open orders and getting my bonus order at 1.3085 open, I'm content.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
A Live Trade Example EUR/USD Jan 8 7:15-7:30 pm EST It's pretty obvious from the moment the candle opens and 5 mins into the candle that price has pretty well had it for going up. I'm just relaxing now, waiting for the down play.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
A Live Trade Example EUR/USD Jan 8 7:30 - 7:38ish pm EST The candle opened with a bang, price took a quick drop. My 1.3080 order is now open and as the candle crossed the 1.3080 price level volume started rising. I moved my stop down, no point of it being way up there anymore, and I decided with both open short orders I'd move my exit to 1.3070 - this is an easy 25 pip gain (10 + 15 pips in 2 orders) so grab my pips and go. 1.3070 is a nice safe level, not breaking any new territory and it looked like I'd get out in this candle - so I could go write about this trade in FF Final Synopsis - a fairly typical (unexciting) trade. I didn't expect the price to move that quickly down and given the speed at which it was moving, I just decided to grab my earnings. It would be better to re-assess the price levels and price/volume after this long down candle and determine the next moves. You should be able to see how market interest was lost chasing a price above 1.3085 and that the market interest was in a downward price falling from 1.3080. In this case 1.3085 was just an added bonus....caught it, so why not profit from it. The 1.3080 price level was determined from the 2 candles that the last 2 vertical red lines run through. I purposely looked at 6:45 to define and justify a price level at 1.3080, since a price level obviously fit (like lego) here. I've got my 2 volume peaks and the candles intersect at only one price that ends in "0" or "5" The 1.3085 price level was determined much further back in the chart at the 4th/5th vertical red lines from the right of the chart. Again 2 peaks, one choice for price level. I found 1.3085 earlier today around 9:30 EST and had traded that short - it was very similar to this last trade I documented, in fact almost an exact duplicate except with only the one entry. So that's how I made 40 pips today using VPLT, I hope you can see it is a pretty straight forward and calm process. The secret is in those price levels, price/volume movement (together) around those price levels and most important - the devils in the details. Hopefully, you can see price levels are not a science. They just have to be justified, and they fit (like lego). ...snap right in.

Would you show your updated chart, please?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
What about the 3rd candle from right? This was the (first) exit level?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Spud, how much volume do we need before we consider it as "peak volume"? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
The volumes I get from my broker is totally useless, why would this be? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #131 ---
A peak level - I would imagine - would be the highest volume bar you've seen so far. An easy way to do it - and this is just my personal preference, I've been running the volume indicator like this for a while - is to put a 20-period BB over your volume indicator. Anything over the 2nd deviation up is a peak, anything above the main line is average, anything below the bottom line is low. It's interesting how price levels from yesterday (red lines) held strong today. Heck, the opening range (light blue square - first 1 hour of trading) formed around them pretty nice.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
So I have been following the stp by step guide. I have made my first demo trade to which I think are the rules. I assume as I have no bottom line to work to this sell should be a 20-30 pip run? Is this pricture correct?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hello Wanderer. I try to address that issue about "what" the volume indicator shows to Spudfyre in post #82 and part of his answer in post #83 was : " It really doesn't matter what the volume indicator shows. It's relative. As long as it stays consistent with price movement, that is what matters about the volume indicator ." So, I assume, it does not matter what "your" indicator shows... as long as stay "consistent" with price movement... but, what does means??? I do not see any consistency between what his indicator shows and price movement (from all his posted charts) and I do no see any consistency in the one you show... I can not make any sense from it... but it seems some do. The major issue in play is that The so called "volume" that most see in their platforms is the "number" of ticks of a specific bar... and that will be different in all brokers. But the main part is that the "number" of forex ticks will NEVER have any consistency with price moves. The span of a bar could be 50 pips with 50 ticks .. or could be 1 pip with 50 ticks... So... in other words, while all brokers could have almost identical bar size, say 15m bars, most will register different number of ticks, so the so called "volume" bars will be completely different. I hope that explain what you see in your charts. J.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Not how much. We are just looking at relative volume to each other. So "peak" or "spike" volume points just poke out higher than the rest around it. A nice "U" or "V" shape between our volume peaks is perfection. You can be much more picky about peak clarity or perfection when looking for price levels in recent history. However, in live trading peaks will be dynamic until the peak is actually defined....in other words yiu have to trade with the knowledge you have at the time....which really won't affect anything becuase price/volume respond accordingly. So, there is no preset "level" or amount to volume. We are using volume to justify our price level decisons - reading a book and interpreting what the markets are telling us.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
If you were in a long trade from about 11:00, yes, that would be the exit.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Ugly. However, not useless. Price/volume movements are still consistent with the way price is moving between price levels. The degree of change between volume bars is small. I would zoom in as much as possible but you still read the price/volume moves the same as the wander away/towards a price level.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Interesting use of BB. Makes total sense as a way to identify peaks. You can use lesser peak levels though, but certainly this would keep you focused on the stronger moves.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
The setup is good. Our goal is always to trade to price levels. In the case where we don't have a bottom price level, the risk is much greater for a failure. I'd work within the bottom price first, it is at 1.3045. I'd look to target an entry in at 1.3060. This is a trade you have to watch and keep assessing the situation. A 30 pip target on entry on something like this, is really risky.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
any suggestions on my pic spudfyre? It went the direction I intended and would of made pips. This is my next trade setup would this be within the rules? I realise the SL/TP is not 2:1 but just getting the feel of the price levels. I feel the price level is a good one a@ 1.30500 The price has creeped past this level but the volumes so far are declining again which enforces a no interest at a higher level

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Common sense would say: "A peak is the one volume bar that is jutting higher than the rest" - lol. But yeah, using the BB essentially gives you three different "strengths" of "interest" with the bands and the main line. I look at it as being more of a visual thing than anything "absolutely necessary".

--- 帖子 #141 ---
The Volume indicator would probably be the key to the Grail if it would indicate the inter bank volume. Unfortunately it indicates the volume of trades made by the traders working with the particular dealer. The Volume indicator will be different for each dealer and that makes it useless.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
What a complete waste of your time commenting the above statement, its not constructive and has no useful information for other users. Its clear you have not tried the method but already saying it wont work. . He has already been over this. He states the indicator is showing signs of interest in a price level. If the volume increases its obvious and makes sense people are interested in that price.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
It doesn't matter what volume measures (in tems of broker ticks, trades, dollars, etc) as long as it remains consistent with price. When, I say consistent, I mean that the broker is always using, say trade volume, and doesn't switch it up half way through your day. So, not likely that the broker is going to change what they measure in volume any time soon. Price and volume moves together do mean something. Volume is a relative measurement, no different than any oscillator indicator. Volume levels do not tell you "how much" price moves, price moves tell you how much price moves. The reason this is called Volume Price Level Trading is because when price moves towards/away from a price level, volume (interest) in that price level will increase or decrease. If you don't like volume, you can use any relative indicator to do the same thing. However, I use volume because it is so simple and quick...and most of all, it works reliably and consistently...and in trading for a liviving, that is what you want the most. I have no doubt people will see volume and poo-poo all over volume. Because all they see is volume and never look at the relationship between volume and price together and how it works when crossing different price levels. So yes, you are correct - volume by itself is useless. However, this forum is not about volume by itself.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
This thread is music to my ears, this is the way I'd like to trade. Keep on Spudfyre... The hardest thing for me is to forecast what price will do (will go up to upper price level or down) between the levels ...

Marine jan, I tried using volumes and found its uselessness. My post is rather constructive because it helps people to save time. I just let you know that the indicator shows the number of deals concluded by a couople of thousand traders, included newbies, who work with that particular dealer. Then it is your choise to rely on that statistics or not. And again, if the indicator would indicate the interbank contracts that would be excellent. Unfortunately it does not.

Well, not for nothing but you've got people "poo-pooing" over every subject here. Especially volume (except the VSA folk) because that's what they're told. "Forex isn't a centralized market so the volume is meaningless" Personally, I always begged to differ since, if it were useless, brokers wouldn't waste the time offering it - I could be wrong. But to say that out of the many tens-of-thousands of Forex traders out there, to assume that not a single one has found value in tick volume seems, for lack of a better term, ignorant. Folks said the same thing to those of us who worked over in the Market Profile thread but people still use it and it helps them see the market in a way that makes them money. I think that's what people miss about this; it's all about perception. For example, Spud refers to volume as "interest" which makes it easier for him to perceive the market. I got a friend - he's old school - who refers to them as "speed bars". Different strokes for different folks I say. I, for one don't see how people can trade planetary cycles but I'd never knock someone for doing it. You see a lot of that here on FF, folks knocking others for the way they trade. Well, what business is it of yours? Poo-poo on them!

Just curious, but do you have a better way of trading that incorporates any logical way and method of trade executions that works and is consistent? If you do please Im me and let me know.

I have been a student of volume and price trading for a few years now, and this is the most clear and concise description of how to use price and volume to trade. TAKE ADVANTAGE! Here is my trade this morning using the method Spudfyre outlines in this thread. I have not used my knowledge of volume trading or a combination of other volume methods to take this trade. I just simply followed his instruction to look for those things he outlined and made my trade.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
The fact that volume remains relatively consistent from one major spot fx broker to another and is also consistent with fx futures volume just further demonstrates it is useless, random data that just happens to show the same information -- it is all coincidence and we are all destined to lose our money. You are very smart. Now go away.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
There are countless people across this forum and other forums that think volume or rather Tick volume is useless, this argument has been hashed out numerous time over the years, If it makes sense to you use it, If it does not then just go and find something that does make sense to you and prosper with it, but please quit rattling on and on and on. Simply read what Spud has said, then try to wrap your tiny Mellon around it and make the best effort you can, ON A DEMO ACCOUNT, until you can master the method.

If you do not like my post why just not to ignore it? Your aggressive reaction only indicates lack of inteligence.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
On that note, if you don't like the trading methodology, why not ignore the thread? Your participation in it only indicates your lack of intelligence.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
If you guys think you are intelligente just ignore my recommendation and do the way you prefer. I still do not understand why you assault people? Are you in a climax age?

You're right. Let's put this tool on ignore and get back to the topic at hand.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Keep reading...I'll keep going over it. P.S. I no longer call it forecasting where the price will go. I prefer to thing of it as evaluating, reading, justification for a decision. I find if I use "forecast" I let myself off the hook sometimes to be a little lazy and start guessing. I know it is just words, but I find it keeps me better focused - may just be me.

Hi Bilstein, Spot On !!!! Yes, the "poo-pooing" of ideas, methods and systems is pervasive here on FF... Some are downright ugly about it. I amazed at how fast it can happen in a new thread. In my opinion it is a "wiring problem”... This incredible need to be right and their frustration with not realizing they are their own worst enemy. Trading is 90% mental and 10% method (IMHO). When I started back in 99' I was one who did not understand the mental side of trading... Cost me a WHOLE lot of $$$$$$...The requirement to "think differently" is very difficult for most to even understand ... let alone accomplish. I still mess it up ( more than I would like ) due to my own flawed thinking. One's attitude tells me a lot about their ability to trade. Sadly, with that poo-pooing attitude they will never become the trader they condem others for trying to be. The Smart Money realizes this and trades accordingly.. The Smart Money profits.. the Dumb money ( those who rag ) lose. Just my 3 pips TSD

Nice trade!

Hi Spud I'm really happy to see you back. You suddenly disapeard years ago and now your back. :-) I studied your Stochastics threads but never had a chance to get my questions answered. Your contribution here is very valuable! So I will not hesitate to ask my questions as long you're around! I got it on how to place the price levels. But I seem to be a little dense on understanding how you determine if a level will hold or if it will break through it. I have a hard time deciding on wether I should go long or short when approaching a level. I hope you will go into this again. (please) Thanks PS. here a link for the guys that disbelieve the tick volume thing. Traded Volume and Tick Volume is highly correlated! http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/yhst-...CVN050110.html

--- 帖子 #159 ---
The common factor(s) I've noticed in many, many volume-related threads is that the folks who dog it are the ones who can't (won't) understand it. They may try it and realize they have a few losing trades here or there then next thing you know, the OP is an idiot for suggesting that volume can be used in Forex. To me, if you're the type of idiot who goes from thread to thread dissing on peoples' trading methods, you're just a "grail-er" looking for a way never to be wrong. Some folks get passed that stage of trading for a living. Sadly, most do not - about 90-95% of them.

Hm... basicly we're determining S&amp;R based on high interest price levels?!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
That's where we are headed.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I've been waiting for this comment. Price levels would seem to be the same as S&amp;R, and sometimes they will both land in the same place....maybe a lot of times, but don't get the two confused. Price levels are determined by price/volume movement and how volume is reacting to the price as it approaches/moves away from a price level. Volume shifts as price moves around a price level, kind of like a weather vane...arrow pointing this way, than that way. S&amp;R are more floors and ceilings of price. S&amp;R also traditionally work off trends and trendlines. Price levels are how we target trade ranges and directions of trades. That might seem like a floor and ceiling, and in a brief way it is, but we are free from the confines of trend, trend reversals, and trend anything. Our price winds blow where the market likes the price level. I have not answered everything here between the difference of S&amp;R and price levels --- let's just say they are not the same and agree on it (or agree to disagree). Otherwise we will spend pages on a phylosophical debate between the two. I'd be happy if anyone wants to start an entirely new thread on the subject, let's just not do it here.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Devil In The Details I have discussed one way to set price levels. What I'm about to discuss here is how to read price/volume. I've explained volume = interest. Price is our compass. So price/volume as a combination "point at market interest". Now, let's consider everything previous to this as the basics. Now as "experts" in VPLT we will open the chart up and read it like a book. As such, our focus now is to read price/volume as it moves around a price level. Best way is to jump right in and start. I'll start with a 20 candle sequence in recent history....I just picked it because it is the most recent. So, fresh chart EUR/USD M15. This is a live chart so the chart picture may change a bit as we progress. I'm zoomed way in.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
First thing I need is a price level. The price level is just a reference line that price/volume moves around and reacts too. Once the price level is established we can start reading the price/volume. So, to find my first price level, I picked out 3 peaks near the left side of the chart. I want to read the candles from left to right, and I want to focus on finding a price level that fits the candles on the right side of the chart. I drew 3 straight vertical red lines from 3 volume peaks (spikes) through there corresponding price candles. I then drew a horizontal price level at the only price that ends in "5" or "0" that goes through all 3 candles. (FYI: if the price level narrowly misses a candle, no big deal).

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Alright! Now the fun part. Let's start reading the chart from the first price candle to the right of our right most vertical red line (where the green up arrow is), and progress candle by candle. (19:15 candle Jan 9) At the volume peak, price came up through our price level, this movement across a price level typically generates more interest (volume) hence this is why peaks generally slice through a candle. More (interest) volume because generally the most orders will be executed on at the "5" or "0" price and in this case 1.3055. Candle 1 (19:15): Down. Price opened above our price level, there was less interest in price being above 1.3055 after price crossed the 1.3055 price level. Candle 2 (19:30): Up. Less interest in an up candle (volume down), so there is less interest in price trying to rise higher. 1.3060 seems to right now be the upper limit of price levels. Candle 3 (19:45): Down. Candle sliced through the 1.3055 price level and interest (volume) increased, but not as much as when the candle cut up through the price level at 1.3055 at 19:00. Candle 4 (20:00): Up: Small price climb with little interest (volume). Price level is now firmly confirmed at 1.3055 with a tendency to be more interest (volume) with price rising up through 1.3055. Good entry for a long trade for short pips to 1.3060. Candle 5 (20:15): Up: Large upward price move cut up through the price level and went through the upper price limit we saw in candle 2 of 1.3060. We'll need to adjust our chart with a new price level at 1.3060.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
We've had to add a new price level at 1.3060. The volume peak is small, but what is really defining this price level is that we've had 3 candles just pass through this level, but nothing else. Candle 6 (20:30): Down. Further support that price doesn't want to go much higher than 1.3060. As expected interest (volume) is down in a higher price. Candle 7 (20:45): Up. Price climbed back up above our 1.3060 price level and interest is up because of this. However, price is higher but interest lower than in candle 5. So there is little likelie hood at this point price will go any or much higher. Candle 8 (21:00) Up. Price is going to try the 1.3065 level, volume is less (no interest) so this price level will not hold. If there was interest in a 1.3065 price level, volume would have increased. Good time for a short entry and catch a few pips to 1.3055. Small ranges, but sure price moves, why not make some small pip trades. Candle 9 (21:15) Down. Simple confirmation of 1.3065 level not holding any interest. Candle 10 (21:30) Down. Price has started to move back down towards our 1.3060 price level which has increased interest (volume).

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Candle 11 (21:45): Up. Price has been dropping for the last 3 candles and interest (volume) has picked up. Price touches the 1.3060 level and volume peaks, so that is as expected. The price level is at 1.3060 and this is where the interest is at. Going down. Candle 12 (22:00): Down. Interest (volume) is down. We know price above 1.3060 is dead, so no interest there. The downward move in price across 1.3060 price level should have sparked some interest but it did not. So, the market doesn't have any interest in a 1.3065 price and there seems to be little interest at 1.3060 price level. Interest definitely is not in an upward price move. So, only one direction to go, down. Candle 13 (22:15): Down. A tricky play. Price is following down and no change in interest. We'd expect an increase in interest if price was falling towards 1.3055. We know our direction can only be down, so we have to conclude that the lack of interest is because we are following away from the higher 1.3060. The other assumption of price turning up just doesn't make a lot of sense, though possible, the odds have to be in favour of price down. Candle 14 (22:30): Down. That's better. Just what we expect with price going down and touching our 1.3055 price level and interest (volume) going up. Total confirmation again of 1.3055 price level and that market interest is at 1.3055. Candle 15 (22:45): Down. Now what? Price crosses down across 1.3055 and interest is less. Looks like the market is content within our 2 price levels. For now the market likes 1.3055.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Candle 16 (23:00): Down. Price crosses 1.3055, and volume is up. Nothing really unexpected here as we know the market likes 1.3055 price level. Candle 17 (23:15): Up. Yep...boring. Price and market is stuck at 1.3055. Price climbs closer to 1.3055 and interest is up. Candle 18 (23:30): Down. Price down, interest drops as we move away from 1.3055. We have a new peak from candle 17 and close too but not yet a price level forming possibly at 1.3050. For now, just a reference as price doesn't want to seem to go to 1.3050 and the market is still concerned with 1.3055. Candle 19 (23:45): Up. Price up, interest drops. Not a lot of price change and market still showing it doesn't like being below 1.3055. Candle 20 (24:00): Up. Same story, market wants to be at 1.3055. Volume increased which can be expected as price hit 1.3055 price level.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Candle 21 (00:15): Down. Same story continues. Interest drops as price falls away from our 1.3055 price level. Candle 22 (00:30): Up. Price drops across 1.3050, still not a price level to us. Interest picked up and this could be a peak in volume, we don't know yet, so status quo, market still holds interest in 1.3055. Candle 23 (00:45): Down. Peak confirmed in Candle 22. New price level at 1.3050. Price dropped but there is less interest than where price was at previous candle. This candle crosses both price levels. If the interest was at 1.3050, then the peak would have been here, there would have been higher volume. So, overall there is less interest at this lower price. Candle 24 (01:00): Down. Price goes down across our new price level at 1.3050 but still less market interest. So our market interest still seems to be at 1.3055. Market interest has been at 1.3055 for a while, so this is starting to look like a key price level for something. Candle 25 (01:15): Down. Price down, interest down. There is no peak here so no new price level below 1.3050 yet. Market still focused on 1.3050. Candle 26 (01:30): Down. Price goes up and interest is less. Looks like we are starting to see the bottom of this price move. Could definitely put a long in here if we get down to 1.3040 (to make it worthwhile). Candle 27 (01:45): Down. Well that's a little larger price move down then expected. Hit our 1.3040 mark so we can go long to 1.3050. Very little increase in interest and no peak still, so no new price levels down here. This is some take profit territory, put the longs in play. Candle 28 (02:00): Up. There we go. Good solid price move up, assume it is a peak. Set a price level at 1.3040. Market interest way up, no wonder, we are headed back to where the market loves it at 1.3050.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Candle 29 (2:15): Up. Price is up and interest slipping as we near 1.3050. This slippage could be the result of pulling away from 1.3040 price level. Nothing so far to assume that we won't cross 1.3050, could bail from long trades if skittish. Risk takers throw a stop in at 1.035 and stay in long. Candle 30 (2:30): Up. Still can't cross 1.3050. Interest would have peaked if we crossed 1.3050, so it seems market interest is fading as price moves away from 1.3040 price level.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I'll stop here as I don't want to start to signal trades. Well that was 30 candles and that is how I read the charts with price/volume moving around price levels. This example wasn't great because our range was fairly small and price levels were popping up close together. Even so, we had very clear pip opportunities to seize on. If you read through those 30 candles, you can see how I am translating/justifying the price/volume moves relative to the price level. Really, only 1 candle in the 30 that was tricky but by sticking to overall market interest I just stayed the course. Otherwise, there isn't a whole lot of room to interpret the price/volume moves any differently. You can also see as we get near the end, how price levels take shape and form around price/volume moves...and or don't exist. You can see as we neared 1.3040 there was no price level on the way down, if interest in price was to keep going down there would have been an increase in interest (volume), especially if on the way down we crossed 1.3040. By that not being there, price had to start going up. There was no other way and the candles just before were indicating the market had no interest down here around 1.3040. So, again the upward move was loud and clear. Things are setting up. Give it a shot (on a demo account).

Hi Spud Thank you for your help. I got my first trade today by following your rules. I took a trade at 8.45 GMT -entry 13060. Closed at 13002 for 42 pips after a peak.. But the potential is there for the price to go higher will be following the price volume relationship to get another entry. I'm keenly following your thread and want ti thank you for sharing your insights. jess

Hi Spud Cannot thank you enough for this detailed approach to your trading technique. I came accross your Stochastic Elasticity thread a couple of months ago and after reading and digesting the method, it proved to be the first time i felt i had a truly consistent approach to my trading - . The invaluable information you freely share with the community is what we serious students of the forex market crave. Keep up the fantastic work Thanks again Ginogee (Thanks to Caveman for posting summary doc ) Great to catch a thread from it's infancy.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Great thread. I have just one question that I hope wasn't previously addressed -- exactly when do these levels get removed? When price no longer shows any reaction to them? When price/volume show either interest or lack of interest in another level near a prior one? Any guidelines for knowing when to ignore these levels in the future? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi Caveman Question if I may... Your statement: " I am quite shocked that you are even sharing this knowledge " .. Just curious why you would say that ? Respecfully, TSD

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Nice work!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
1. Like this, with price levels; 3 years. It comes from 20 years of refinement for me in understanding how to use it properly. This "system" is as old as the ticker tape. My refinement has come with the use of price levels, understanding market "interest" around those price levels, and wrapping it around my head. 2. I make 20 pips a day -- that's my pedestal and I preach to anyone who will listen and wants to make consistent money in Forex. I put value in my 20 pips, not in how many pips I can get. I can make 20 pips a day with MTF Stochastics, but using VPLT is "oh my gawd" less stressful and way more consistent. Some days I make a lot more than 20 pips, just because the market pulls me along. Like last night when I was writing about 30 candles, I didn't anticipate I'd lead right into a market that was gearing up for a take off. If the market is going to hand me a ton of pips I'm going to take it. VPLT makes it easy to see it. Yesterday into today was pip-a-tastic! 3. Yes, I could, but I won't. At least not at this stage. I have a lot of reasons for this, none of which are to prove how succesful this is for me. I'd much rather disect trades or show you how I got there, so you can trade succesfully. Just for fun, maybe later, I might just for laughs do it, cuz I think it is neat. For now, my mission and time is to show people they can successfully trade.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes, I was curious too.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
The simple answer, you just know when they are relevant and when they are not. There's no fixed life span on price levels and no rules like the older the price level is the more irrelevant it is. You just have to let the market tell you what price levels are relevant. The nice thing about VPLT, is that you can wipe the chart clean of price levels and start again, because the market will always keep telling you where they are. I tend to wipe out the close together ones where price is now and just keep the most relevant in the market to where I am now. I'm a 20 pip/day trader so I don't need to know a lot of PL's. You could come up with a lot of different strategies with this. I'd just say, if you are getting confused, don't be afraid to wipe the slate clean and give yourself a fresh start. It's never a bad idea to check your work anyways

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Caught the move! Good work.

Candle 3 (19:45): Down. Candle sliced through the 1.3055 price level and interest (volume) increased, but not as much as when the candle cut up through the price level at 1.3055 at 19:00. Bigger candle thant two before and volume increased - doesnt it mean price would like to go down? After candle 4, which was up with even less volume you wrote "Good entry for a long trade for short pips to 1.3060.". Big candle with bigger volume versus small candle low volume - how it is clear to you thats good place to go long?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yep.. Just thought is was an interesting statement ?? I am enjoying your thread greatly.. I use volume in my forex trading... Will defintely keep following. Thanks for sharing TSD

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Price/Volume as it relates to price level. Don't get too hooked on candle sizes. 3 previous candles are closed pretty much at same price, and volume (interest) is going down. The market has just not got enough steam to push the price up through 1.3060. Hence, price will flop. The price drop below 1.3055 is the market giving up on that higher price but there was less volume when this price dropped below the price level, than when prior it rose above. That can only mean that the market has more interest in trying to push the price up past 1.3055. The lower volume 1 candle previous is the market giving up at trying for 1.3060. Candle 4 confirms this because the price stays below 1.3055, there is no volume down here. Going long now at Candle 4, is trying to take advantage of the market wanting the price to go up. The market is testing 1.3060, so a price higher than 1.3060 seems reasonable, bcause if the test succeeds it will cross that level. I can't emphasize enough how price/volume is tied to price levels. It isn't candle size. A small candle can generate bigger volume crossing a price level (see candle 20), and likewise a big candle can generate small volume when it is nowhere near a price level (see candle 12). -&gt; Just remember all 3 are relative to each other price/volume and price levels. Let me know if that makes sense, because it is an important observation you brought up.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thanks Spudfyre, finding this thread of real interest but have a basic question relating to your threshold volume levels. Why are they not linear across TFs eg 500 @ M15 = 2,000 @ H1 but you use 1,000. Sorry to be a pain but it is just bugging me!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
What about large candles/volume that are produced by news, like today at 13:30 and 13:45 GMT? Are these candles used or overlooked because of the news only traders that cause the increases in volume?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes thanks I think i got the point here and I think its very important point and I need to study more charts to "read the tape" corectly... I have studied VSA (volume spread analysis) and it says high volume on big up candles = weakness, high volume on big down candles = strenght. Do you use these theories in your "tape reading"?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Market interest is market interest. Is it skewed? There can be other things that skew price/volume, but in the end market interest in a price level is market interest. Sometimes the ride can be bumpy, but it never takes long for the market to zero in on price.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
These are not fixed levels on the volume indicator. I just use a line for my eye to look at peaks. This line is not required, and probably I should not have included it in my intro. It's just like putting a straight edge along the graph to focus on what volume levels I want to see.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Spudfyre, Thanks for this superb thread. Why not consider putting and average volume line over a period of time rather than a mere line or no line at all ? Thanks again. Roy

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Well, because these are insights that a trader gains after years of trading and analysis with the volume indicator on the charts. There are only 2 things on a chart that truly reflect market sentiments - Price and Volume. The best part is that you made it so simple to understand. But still, not many will. A pity.

Three firs candles witj red arows formed price level at 1.3250 Candles 1, 4, 10 formed price level at 1.3270 Candle 2 - Down. Price opened above and closed below our price level, there was less interest in price being above 1. 3270 after price crossed the 1. 3270 price level Candle 3 – UP. With low volume. Interest (volume) is down in a higher price. Candle 4 – our level confirmation. Candle 5 – Down – price moves away from our level, volume decreases Candle 6 – UP, near our level, volume down, market shows less interest in beeng at our price level 1.3270 Candle 7 – DOWN, low volume (lowest of our 7 candles) - Price is going to try the 1.3260 level, volume is less (no interest) so this price level will not hold. If there was interest in a 1. 3260 price level, volume would have increased. Good time for a long entry and catch a few pips to 1. 3270. Small ranges, but sure price moves, why not make some small pip trades. Candle 8 – UP – low volume – dont know how to describe this candle (if I am in long on previous candle, then now I‘m in doubt because price arrived near our 1. 3270 level with low interest). Candle 9, 10 – level 1. 3270 still in play. And candle 10 down with higher volume than on candle 9 up shows that market likes to be under that level 1. 3270. Candle 11 – Down, low volume, market shows it doesnt like to be above 1. 3270 – Good place to short? I will stop here, gotta go to work. Waiting for coments and critics on my analysis (candle by candle please )

I hope Spud will answer my question.Based on m4ntas' analysis above where is the right entry then?Is it long or short? TP? If price above 1.3270 volume is down and if price below 1.3270 volume also down. Volume only up when a candle crosses the price level. Thanks!

Hi VPLT Trader, maybe my contribution helps to find good and strong price-levels. In the picture below you can see that i marked only medium and strong levels, where the blue line thickness indicates the levels of interest. For evaluating these levels, I simply generate a Renko-Chart with boxsize of 5. ('0' and '5' prices are only relevant). What you can also see, that (very often) a peak in volume marks a local high/low and indicates a relevant priceaction. Kind Regards Mediator Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I've never really liked Renko charts, mainly because I never found a use for them. This, however, is an interesting application of them. Thanks!

Candle 8 simply supports candle 7. Market doesn't have much interest with price being around 1.3260 and would rather it be heading up past 1.3270 where the price level is. Candle 10 (after canlde 11 is finished), confirms our price level because there is a volume peak here. Even if you ignore the volume peak, candles 9&amp;10 market is telling us price is pretty solid on 1.3270. We know price has to go somewhere from 1.3270 at sometime. The market likes it much more when price is going up to and even through 1.3270 price level. So that would seem that long is the choice. However, take another look and rememebr that the market will want price to move. Candle 4 is the largest upward price reach, crosses our price level at 1.3270 and has the highest volume. At candle 4, nothing wrong with putting a long order in, but we must be aware that chasing an unknown price level above 1.3270 is full of risk. If you believe at this moment price will break through 1.3270 then your order is at or below 1.3270. However, by the time we get to candle 11, we should be bailing from our long trade. By candle 11 there is a definite shift in market for price to go down, and here is why: Candle 10 is the key. Candle 7,8,9 is a general run up of price towards 1.3270 and volume does exactly what you would expect..so again a long trade is not out of the question...but risky because we have no info above 1.3270 and that is a "bet" on a breakthrough. However, candle 10 will bring you to your senses. Price dropped and volume kept climbing. Candles 11,12 all this is saying no breakout, still stuck on 1.3270 as a limit. From candle 6, 9, 13, all climb backs in price to 1.3270....but can you see that each one is decreasing in volume to the one previous. Volume wise candle 6 is less than 5; 9 is less than 10, and 13 is less than 10,11,12. So there is no break out up that will happen. I'd just be watching this thing for now. NEXT CHART.... A little after this chart (in the next chart) you should be able to catch the 1.3250 to 1.3270 move. It's a simple trade between our price levels. The volume talk, that peak when price drops like a bomb (candle 35) and hits 1.3250, what is it confirming? Our price level at 1.3250. Peaks exist at price levels. (36) When price climbs and volume rises, confirmation of the price level and the interest up and away from from 1.3250 (go long). (37) When price drops and volume drops, swift kick to your (butt) to go long. (39) And look where your candle crosses on the next volume peak...1.3270.

VPLT TRADING Practica l Tra d ing This is a step-by-step approach to trading with VPLT on EUR/USD M15. I'm goin g to start us of in "no mans land" - Jan 10th 2013. No reason, other than it is in the m iddle of a surging upwar ds pric e move , and we have a huge volume peak. Good as place as any to start.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
First job as always is to find a price level. Next volume peak along and we end up with a price level at 1.9000. Not the best for accuracy, but it gives us a starting point, we can quickly find where the market was at on this chart. The price level was found by putting green vertical lines through 2 volume peaks. A "clear" volume peak is one where the volume is less on both sides of the volume bar in the centre. Ideally we want 2 peaks that will only give us 1 choice for a price level. Price levels always end in "0" or "5". In this example, the price level can only be 1.9000. Ideally the price level line will pass through both price candles where our volume peaks are, but sometimes like in this example, we have to take a best fit approach.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Spudfyre, again thank you for your effort. I hope one day I can read each candle as you would. I just wanted some clarification on the canlde 36 and 37. You said in candle 6, price climbs and volume rises but on the chart, candle 36' volume is lower than the last 2 bars why did you said its rising? And on candle 37, you said volume drops but on the picture the volume is rising up higher than the bar 36. Maybe I missed something. Thanks!

Zoom in on the chart. We have one "loosy" price level set up for a reference point. The devil is in the details, so lets examine some price/volume movement. (1) Candle 1 marked on chart. So, we don't know anything about market interest about the price, so let's start making notes on what we do see. Prive is down, volume is down from peak. This is a normal market reaction (volume down) after a peak and setting a price level. Interest after all is at the price level. Note that price moved down towards the price level and volume dropped. -- we can't interpret anything more from that. Lot's of assumptions available, but let's ignore those. (2) The second price candle moves down and the volume goes down. So price is moving away from our 1.9000 price level and interest is less. So, is price going up, away from the price level have less interest than price moving down towards price level? Noted. (3) Price up and volume up higher than (1) and (2), could be a peak, we wouldn't know yet if this was real time, so we'll pretend we are assuming it is a peak as we would if it were real time. So the volume rise makes sense because we need to draw a new price level. We know the price level must be above (2), otherwise our volume peak would have been at (2). And the price level goes through (3). That puts it either at 1.3215 or 1.3220. At this stage where we only see (3), we just have to pick one and wait for (4) to tell us.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
The candle and volume identified on the chart by arrows are off. The actual volume to match the candle is the one to the left. Count from the right side of the chart (6 in from right). Should make sense now. That's why I always draw lines between my candles and volumes....easy mistake to do.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Oh! I see... Thanks. Yes it does make sense now.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
(4) The volume of (4) is less than (3) so now we conformed (3) is a peak. (4)'s price is moving up and volume down, which means that the interest is getting weaker as it should after a price level as the price moves away from the price level. This means the price level must be below (4) so at 1.3215. Price level established. ATTENTION: DEVIL IN THE DETAILS MOMENT (5) and (6) simply hold the line...but (5) gives us a warning of things to come. It drops in price and drops in volume - we would expect that if price dropped towards the price level, volume would rise. So, is interest starting to move away from price level? (6) confirms it. LONG ENTRY NOTICE (7) is confirmation of (5) and (6). Price is up and volume is up. Now we have our best confirmation that price wants to move away from this price level. Stick a long trade in as close to the close of (7) or right at open of (8). Long on 1.3220 or above Stop on 1.3190 (we'll move up after, only for entry) Exit target 30 pips (1:1) for entry/stop - 1.3250

--- 帖子 #210 ---
(8) and (9) are price up, volume up. You could exit at (9) near 1.3250 as that's a good trade or hang on. We have to assume 9 could be a volume peak, so should treat it accordingly that 1.3245 or 1.3250 may be our next price level. Move the stop to 1.3210. (10) Exit trade, price up, volume peak. New price level confirmed on (11). 30 pips, that's good to me. You could ride this trade to (11), but then for sure you need to exit when the new price level is confirmed at (10) after (11) closes. That ends this trade.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi Spudfrye I to have been following volume. My question is: How does your method take into acount the large moves produced by the opening and closing of trading sessions. i.e. London open to Newyork open, London close and Newyork close. Areas of high volitility? Thanks trd4gs

Hi Spud, .............................(10) Exit trade, price up, volume peak. New price level confirmed on (11). 30 pips, that's good to me. You could ride this trade to (11), but then for sure you need to exit when the new price level is confirmed at (10) after (11) closes. That ends this trade.[/quote] The light in the tunnel is shining brighter and brighter!!! Thanks for the brilliant, well constucted posts. Please keep up the good work. Pete

Hi Mediator, Could you pass on the Renko indicator you used and also the 'volume prediction' indicator please? Obviously, using a Renko chart with volume a price based, rather than time based, volume indicator is needed. Very interesting chart which I think could be very useful to detect accumumation areas etc. before an upmove. Renko charts are great at giving a different angle on what is going on - I love to see big volume in a small range = big move coming!! Regards, Willow

Hi Spudfrye, I have been following this system and it really helped me have lots of good trades to far. Incredible! Thank you very much for your kind sharing. Just wanna check with you, will this method work on Daily time frame as well, as I feel the volume is not really the intra-day volume any more? Is there any big difference? Regards

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Sorry, I can't answer that, as I never trade daily. Something that would need some testing. Open to anyone sharing results!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
The bottom line is it doesn't change a thing. However, I'm aware of it...the same way I keep one eye on the market news while trading. I wouldn't go as far as saying it ever affects my trading, and generally I just stick to VPLT. Call it a time to be more focused in on the details of what the market is doing.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
The Big Picture VPLT Want to know how to make pips in a ranging market? Want to know which way to trade for a break out? Well here you go: Take a look at the big picture. The chart below has 3 price levels; blue (low), red (middle), green (top). Each peak volume has been identified with one of 3 coloured vertical lines. These vertical coloured peaks, correspond to the price level they affect. So a volume peak where a price candle intersects a blue price level line will have a blue vertical line. White vertical lines price candles cross 2 price levels, so ignore those for this example. All price/volume moves are relative to each other. Always remember this! Volume is not independent from price movement - always together. So from this, the rest is easy: Ignoring the white vertical lines....and moving from left to right 2 red vertical line volume peaks are lower than the next 2 green vertical line volume peaks (market interest long) Then 2 red lower than green (market interest long) Then 2 blue lower than red and green (market interest long) So ideally, you would buy long on price candles at or below our blue price level. But at red and green price levels you can still by long, as that is where market interest is. So, now we can rank our price levels: Blue longs require lowest stop - low risk, optimum long Red longs Green longs we trade to break out require highest stop - highest risk, poorest long returns So you can keep following this pattern along the range, where the green price level has the highest volume (interest) and the blue level has the lowest volume (interest). This is a long market interest. Keep trading long from the blue and you just walk the volume up through the break out at the right of the chart. Volume, Price and Price Levels...VPLT. It's all relative.

All the stars, class of 2007, coming out the wood work. Nice to see you back Spud and Islander!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Here's a big picture VPLT with a market swing. Our highest price level green has the lowest volume, so market direct is short. This flows through red, blue and purple, with purple price level having the highest volume Then market swings, where the next purple peak volume is the lowest, so time to go long. When we hit the green price level, volume is highest....long. If we can buy lower than green price level, say at the red price level long, so much the better. Ideally we are buying long at the lowest price level, but if we are in a long market and price is rising and market interest is still long, then keep buying long at each price level. You may miss the optimum long price level buy, but don't miss the rest. Stops are always 1(min) or 2 (max) price levels away....target pips at least 1:1 to stop. This is at entry, you can exit at any time with a pip gain. A pip gain is always a win. You should always move stops to get pip gains...even if you miss the "big one". Don't let ego guide your decisions. Take your pips. Gamble with pips earned, not your money.

Hi Spudfyre Very happy to c you in FF again.I am big fan of MTF Sto.Now u share very useful again.Thank You.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Trying to see if i fully understand your method, Spud. I've been watching the chart, looking for a large volume spike. Here's one at 1.3400. Let's see how it pans out.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hi Spud thank you again for teaching us your method. Please comment my chart. I am trying to unterstand. But clearly on this chart I'm not able to grasp whats going on there are lots of question marks. Thanks for your help. 1. Peak, Level at 3360, presumed because past candles all touched that level 2. Interest down price up, 1 confirmed as a peak, 3. interest up price down, there is more interest in 3360 then higher prices 4. interest down price down, 3 confirmed as a peak, no interest in lower prices 5. interest down price up, interest lower then 4, less interest for higher prices 6. interest up lower price, more interest in lower prices? 7. interest up price down, more interest in lower prices? 8. interest down price up, no interest in higher price, 7 confirmed as a peak, 7 almost touched 3360 confirms 3360 9. interest down price down, no interest for lower price, candles 4-9 giving mixed picture, no clue where price goes. 10. Interest up price climbs higher, maybe a new peak 11. interest same as 10 price up, price wants to stay up there? 12. interest up price up, price wants to climb 13. interest down price down, 12 confirmed as a peak, new level 3375 14. interest down price up, no interest in higher price? 15. interest same as 14 price up crosses 3370, not much interest in higher price confirmed 16. interest shots up price breaks out, new price level somewhere in there, mhhh price did the opposit of what I was expecting 17. interest down price down, 16 confirmed as a peak 18. interest down price down, 19. interest down price up 20. interest down price up 21. interest up price up, falling of interest has stopped, price bottom reached? 22. interest up price up, price reaches almost latest high 23. interest down price down, 22 peak confirmed, new price level 3400 24. interest down price down, no interest in lower prices 25. interest up price down, 26. interest down price up, 25 peak confirmed, new level 3390? 27. interest up price down, no interest in higher prices? 28. interest up price down, 27 confirmed as a peak, level 3390 confirmed 29. interest up price down, price wants to go down confirmed? 30. interest up price down 31. interest up price level

Hi Spudfyre, Thank you very much for your sharing of this brilliant method, and with showing full explanations on all the individual bars on the charts. I used some form of VSA understanding normally, and usually applies my Price Levels only to the Ultra-High Volume bars. As read your thread, I just gave it a go and put more price levels at more volume levels as per your method to see what are the differences to my method. Chart attached is EUR/USD M15 14-Jan, took 2-Long live trades after it went above again at VPL-2 near the Up Arrow, my entries probably not as good as in a few bars too early. For 1st Long, ended up with 1 exit for +30pips set around VPL-1. For 2nd Long, on 15-Jan happened to watch monitor screen to see that big down bar, so exit for a +9 pips that I would consider as a scratch trade. You mentioned that you normally exit for a +20pips trades, do you normally exit all trades OR you leave another position going on for a possible bigger runner? I can feel a bit tedious when watching and doing all the VPL as I was monitoring way too long into USA session which happened to be way past midnight bedtime in my zone. Do you have a specific time limited to when you watch for a trade setup like London Open, USA Open, etc for setting up the VPL zones? Or is it a better setup during the Quiet sessions instead? And now is next day, the charts may get messy with many VPL from yesterday and today, how do you determine which VPL do you delete for the next day?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi Spud, I am following your thread with great interest. Thanks for sharing your experience. Jacques,

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I'm very happy with 7-20 pip trades. I target 20 pips a day and it nets me about 7500 pips a year. That's my "salary" portion of trading which I trade with huge discipline. Now the other side of the down time inbetween, I scalp. I will discuss this with VPLT shortly as scalping is just plain fun and if you can be consistent with it and VPLT, will make you crazy pips...and every night scalping you will fall into a candle that will just shoot off and grab you 20,30,50,etc pips. For example, I scalped for about 3 hours on EUR/USD M15 grabbing 2-3 pips, simply by waiting for a candle to rise above or below a price level. It was a very tight range, and 2-3 pips is all that was being offered. I made 15 trades, some were doubles or triples on the same candle, and one candle slid down 25 pips with 2 shorts on it. So in that brief time, I made close to 60 pips and only lost one trade with -0.2 pips. What, I'm trying to say in a round about manner, is I far prefer to grab small globs of positive pips because they end up being large pip totals...and you are always winning. I trade any time...scalping also let's you do that. I prefer to trade when I want to trade rather than staying up til 4 am. I find trading get's to be a real grind if you are forced to do the night shift....especially if you keep your day job! Safer to side step the first opening day for a few hours after the weekend or holiday, just to let the market get going. Cleaning VPLT -- subjective. I will typically wipe my chart clean when I start a trade round ( I usually trade for 2-5 hours) and then take a long break inbetween. There are times I'll turn on my MT4 and the entire market lines up with my price levels from before...so these I leave on. If a price level is in my way and/or doesn't make sense to my current trade round...I wipe it. The market will put back our price levels, so having more than say 3-5 active in a trade round is about all you need. When you need price levels on a run up or down...just add them.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
OK, Spudfyre, waiting to hear new stuff from you and to keep thread alive, posting my chart - I think my levels are ok, but reading volume with candles are still dificult thing for me. So I went short on candle 5 cloese, because: 1. Candle 1 showed low volume on beeing above price level 2. Volume decreased on candles 3,4,5 showing the price dont like to be above the level 3. Candle 5 up, with lower volume than previous candles (what makes me nervous its volume is bigger than 1st candles...) Any comments Spudfyre and others?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Looks like I should have wait for 6th candle to close with even more less volume than candle 5 and go long...Spudfyre - please comment and, Spud, I think more people are struggling with volume and candle reading, more tips and trick would be nice

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I couldn't agree more. Lack of comments/participation is NOT a sign of a lack of interest in this thread. For me, anyway, this is a completely different way of looking at charts and is unlike anything I have ever done. It looks like a skill well worth mastering but it is definitely a struggle to see how the volume and price movements fit together, especially when you hit that last bar or two on the right side of the screen. There is definitley value to volume price level trading. There is also a steep learning curve, probably because it is so different from what many are used to doing.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Yeah bro, just when you think you got it, it bewilders you. I think the interpretation changes from trade to trade as to how to interpret volume around the reference price level. sometimes I don't know if to look at an individual candle volume in or around the level or look at the over all declining or increasing volume. Finding the peaks and a reference price level is kinda simple but deciding which way to trade is the confusing part I struggle with.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
you guys are all correct, I thought I was the only one still a bit confused about the method. Its a great concept, it makes sense and Im sure it has tremendous value to it. But trying to read it is confusing at times. I do believe volume and price work together, it could only be that way, volume is what moves any market, period. But its reading and understanding it. Spud has a great method, unlike any I have seen , it makes more pratical sense than anything else I have seen on these forums that incorporate indicators and even volume indicators. If anyone else viewing the thread can assist in helping others understand the method and is implementing successfully, it would be nice if they could help out spud in teaching those that are having a bit of a tuff time implementing the method. If someone else gets it, that great.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I couldn't agree more Dappa! I am very interested in this method too. I would love to see Spud throw lots of examples at us. Can't wait to see more posts from Spudfyre!

Top man!!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi Spudfyre, Did you notice this chart the other day ... does this look a good way of picking VPL levels, say with a small pip box size on a Renko chart?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
It looks interesting, I'm not sure what the consistency is like as I have never used Renko for live trading. I would be interested in looking at if further from the standpoint it seems to one way to identify easy trades. If you have done any testing with it, I'd be interested.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Unfortunately, I don't have the indicators myself so I havn't tested it. I'm sure it would work well to find Volume Price Levels if we can get the indicators from someone.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I'm looking forward to hearing about the scalping too!!

VPLT Live Trade Example EUR/USD M15 (1) After a volume peak there is always a drop in volume (interest). Here price goes up and away from our price level of 1.32950. Interest is slightly less, but at this point there is no way to know where the market is headed. What we need to wait for is for the market to tell us how it will move around our current price level, or where the next price level is.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
(2) Price rose and interest rose. This means that the market has more interest up in the 1.3310 level. It is possible that this is a new volume peak and that could make 1.3310 a new price level. We will have to wait for our (3) candle to close and then we should be able to make some decisions if we get a new price level.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
(3) We have established a volume peak at (2). Our new price level is 1.3310. So market interest seems to be far less at this new price level. Take a step back and look at (1) to (3) together...price up, interest down. The overall market less interested in 1.3310. Take a short position as high above 1.3310 as we can, in the open (4) candle is fine. No matter what, take a short at 1.3310. You can have a lot of fun scalping by taking short positions when the price level rises above 1.3310 and exiting below 1.3310....and make some extra pips as price moves through the open candle. Keep to the overall short market, so no long trades.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
(4) Basically no change in market interest or price. Looking at all 4 candles and volume together, still a short market. So everything holds true from (3). Ideally, we will see some rise in price and less market interest. This will allow us to add better short positions. However, 1 short position is fine if that is all you want to trade, as long as it is at 1.3310 or higher.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
(5) Price up, interest lower. It is just pips in the pocket. You should have at least 1 short entry at 1.3310 by now. When price drops, we want volume up. When price rises, we want volume down. Exit....10 pips is grand. Watch the price volume...beware of a possible volume peak, that may end our downward move.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
(6) And there we have it. Easy 10 pips. I had 2 scalps open and a third with a 1.3300 short target...in all it was 28 pips after spreads ...and that is my day of trading done (20 pips). My scalps went a lot better than expected.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I hope running through a live trade session like that was a lot easier to follow. I'll do plenty more in days to come. You can see how by focusing on both individual price/volume moves and the collective move up/volume down, this was an easy short market move to fall into..and literally that is all we do, find the price levels and follow price/volume.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
VPLT Live Trade Example EUR/USD M15 (1) Look back 2 candles from (1). Downward price, increasing volume. Don't be fooled that (1) is a turn around. If next candle price is up and volume down, then we have a new volume peak and price level....but more important we will still be going down.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
(2) New price level with volume peak. You can see I shifted up the old price level at 1.3295 to the new level at 1.3300. No need for clutter. We are still in a short position. Choices are to enter short now and/or wait for price to get as close to 1.3310 as you can. Stay focused on (1) and (2)....price up, volume down. Scalp to 1.3300 or ride the price/volume in your short trade. New game if price reaches 1.3310.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
(3) The markets are being nice and easy tonight. Price down, volume up...short! Better to be in above 1.3300. If (3) becomes a volume peak, it will simply confirm our 1.3300 price level.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
(4) No surprises. Market did exactly what it told us it would do. I exited at 1.3290 with 2 short trades. I like to play it a little safe.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Just peaked at the chart....we could have kept going short...here's a pic. Hope you enjoyed these 2 trade sessions. Now go practice some VPLT.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thanks Spud. Absolutely fantastic your analysis . Since your thread for the first time I really understood how to read the market. Best regards Jess

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Spudfyre, Just gone through some of your older threads. Starting to see what you mean and that it is a good idea when you said you have an "Income Account" for income 20-pips, and a separate "Bank Account" to bank more pips. But unsure how you measure or whether you really separate out the money into 2 accounts. Are you still using Stoch or you focus on VPL now? You mentioned scalping for 2-3 pips, I cannot see how I could do that, and with my broker the spread is already that. Hope you can show some chart examples of how you scalp. I need to clean up the VPL lines after 1-2 days, otherwise just too many. And can observe there is a difference between when I put S&amp;R lines, and then price would react to VPL before reaching S&amp;R lines. Going through mostly my January charts, I seem easier to do Short than Long in reading VPL, and also perhaps better timing is in quieter sessions where there not not much high volume bars. Seem like Asian session may be easier to react to VPL. Would you agree on this? As finding it a bit difficult to see the Longs, would you please include more charts for Longs if possible? Thanks again.

Hi Spudfyre You are the man.I use your VPLT in my live Trade.It success beautiful. For me last 3 years. My position in trade most loss .Less to earn.My starting budget was gone all time. I try to find the many system from internet.But less system gave me confident.Until i read you escaltor to pip. That was great.But i still donot know the point to trade.Until u back and share the Volume Price Level Trading. Now i can confident when trade.You are my master.Thank you so much. Can u advice how to apply to DJI ( Future ) and DAX ( Future ).For those MT4 didnot provide Volume cleary

--- 帖子 #256 ---
enkaisamu, glad to know someone understand VPLT already. Kindly give us your tip or kindly please post your trade examples like Spud? Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Yes that's a good idea. Someone who has grasped it may want to explain it in their own words to those of us who are still struggling to get their heads round the whole process. Thanks

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I didnot Trade on Forex .I Trade stock and Future.So i am Afraid that will confuse all of u.But i will try to develop one for your reference .

--- 帖子 #259 ---
This post exemplifies why I am confused. (3) We have established avolume peak at (2). Our new price level is 1.3310 OK. Makes sense. Our new price level is 1.3310. Yep. So far, so good. So market interest seems to befar less at this new price level. Huh? Price goes up (bar before bar 1) and volume goes up. Price bar 2volume drops a bit when going up (signifying less interest) but on bar 3 price goes up anddoes so on even higher volume. Looks like quite a bit of interest at thatlevel. When price drops at price bar 3 volume greatly declines. My understandingis that price is not interested in going lower yet you suggest taking a shorttrade. Take a step back and look at(1) to (3) together...price up, interest down. Taken together I see price that price goes up and volumegoes up. The first real volume decline is when the candle closes down. Why isn’tthe market interest level at higher prices instead of lower prices (pricedrops, volume/interest drops meaning no interest in going short). I think if I can understand how you determine a lack ofinterest at the 1.3310 level everything else will fall into place. This iswhere I keep getting confused.

I have no idea what happened to the formatting and the words running together. Sorry!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I think i can help spud to answer this if you don't mind. Not sure if i got the right answer, but that's what i can understand from Spud's explanation. The reason why you see bar 3 as a place where traders are not interested with selling could simply be an observation of the candle alone only. What Spud might be trying to say is when bar 2 rose to a volume peak, it doesn't necessary means buying is only option. It could possibly means that traders are trading aggresively in this period of bar, hence the peak of volume. And there is a price level between the bar which caught the trader's interest, either selling or buying. That's why Spud waited for the next bar close (bar 3), and concluded that there's weakness in the price level, as bar 3 is not moving up, but going down with lower volume. The market could be shifting their interest in some other price level. This is what i see and understand.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
hmmmmm, I don't knooooow.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I would be confused as well, low volume on a down bar doesn't mean traders aren't looking to go short?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
well if you use vsa analogy to explain, i don't mean to take this out of topic but probably the best explanation is demand is strong on bar 2, with such high volume and rising price level, the next bar is expected to be bullish too. Yet bar 3 appears as a low volume bearish candle, which probably indicates the demand is no longer in the market, that's why bar 3 is bearish with a low volume. Think it as effort and effect, if there are effort to push price in bar 2, bar 3 should be bullish. But if bar 3 appears bearish low volume, demand are most probably dying on that price level.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
That's how I read it also but am a little confused now

--- 帖子 #266 ---
That makes Better sense.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
This actually helps quite a bit. Bar 2 was up on high volume and, since there was no follow thru, bar 2 marked the highest limit of market interest. Anyone interested in buying at higher prices had already done so I guess which gives us Bar 3, lower volume and price declining (showing a lack of interest in pushing the market higher). Bar 4 was an up bar (slightly) but on even less volume which would confirm the lack of interest at this new, higher level. Therefore, price has no choice but to drop back to where interest was before. I may have this all wrong but that is what I am taking away from it.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Makes more sense, but let see if spud agrees and lets see if this thought process works more times than not.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Yep ... that's how I would read it. Well said!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Being able to find the price levels when we see a volume peak has been a problem for me since I started looking at this thread, but I'm going to persevere. I've found an interesting tool to use which may help!! See chart 1 - the usual 15min chart Chart 2 - is a 1 minute chart with the 15 min candles superimposed on top (in read and green) So, when we find a peak in volume on the 15min we can go look at the 1 minute and maybe pick out the price levels better? Any thoughts? I have attached the indicator which you need to put on the 1min chart and set Timeframe to 15 to see 15 min candles superimposed on it.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
The attached modifications to the chart may help. This is how my decision was made to go short at or above 1.3310. Let me know if that answers the question.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I look for peaks with small candles to help me narrow my options, or peaks/prices that will only give me one option. Generally long candles will be near the top of the candle and short candles near the bottom....not 100% but a good starting point until you can refine the position through other candles.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I assume you mean the price level will be near the top of an UP candle and near the bottom of a DOWN candle ? Sorry, just checking

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Trying to determine which way price will go using VPLT reminds me a bit of those pictures that can be different things depending on how you view it... is it a vase or is it two faces? LOL. I am determined to learn how to view the price/volume relationship to see what the charts are actually telling me instead of what I want them to tell me. Practice, practice, practice.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
LIKE

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes, you convince yourself its a vase, take the trade and then all you can see is two faces !!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
This is really something that blows my mine. Never I have thought that volume can tell me something about the market. I always tot that the volume is just tick that differ from brokers to brokers. However, reading this thread, I get to know that it is like record of traders' activities and interests which we can take full advantage of. It is like playing with open cards in the casino. Those who are not knowing this is alike blind trading.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yes, we are looking at the same picture as Spud but he sees one thing while we see another LOL. Gotta figure out how to see the same "picture" he does. I am farther along than I was at the beginning of the thread so at least I am making progress -- I hope!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Yea. Hopefully Spud can post more of his VPLT live trading so we can see closely how his thinking process is. Currently i am a bit lost myself too, even with repeatingly reading his previous posts lol.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The trick is that some trades are 2 faced, in that the market can turn on us midway. VPLT will give you a lot of confidence to trade in a direction, but...and the BIG but.....you have to be ready to accept a market turn, and not get fixated in 1 direction....or 1 decision. Let the market tell you...you don't tell the market. The beauty of VPLT is that if you are wrong, the usual turn around can be caught and the losses non-existence or very low. As well, it should be very rare that you get a continous string of trades wrong. If you start getting a string of wrong trades, then you need to take a good hard look at why you are seeing things in reverse, and turn your mind around...the market is too hard to move...eaiser to turn your brain. There are a lot of moves in price/volume that become recognizeable....I don't want to say patterns because then people blindly trade patterns and that can be dangerous. However, these recognizeable moves will give you a starting point, or make you double check your position. The most common of these recognizeable moves is the volume drop before and after a volume peak...in live trading it can give you a definite advantage to either being in/out of a trade. I know that is like saying "the sky is blue", but when in a live trade, you'll be amazed how helpful that knowledge is. The weekend is here, it will give me a chance to post some charts with reasoning for long/short.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Great I look forward to more examples. Can you just confirm that you are trading purely off the 15 min chart on EURUSD (and not looking at higher TF for trends etc.) and only looking back around 10-12 hours (40-50 candles) ? Thanks for sticking with us 'slow learners' Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I'm not using anything other than M15. You could use multiple time frames, but at this stage I think it would add a layer of complexity we really don't need. (I'm an MTF advocate, just so you know). The live trade examples I published, I found 3 volume spikes and a price level or two. Not even 6 hours back. I recommended 12-24, to get you practicing, but when you get good at establishing price levels, you just need a starting point established and go. Look at my last two live trades and I'm really starting those trades from the last volume peak (candle 0). I take a look back about 4-5 candles for a bigger picture, but I'm starting to plot the market from (1). How far you go back is really about getting a feel for the market....I'd certainly recommend when starting out you go back the 12-24 hours for good practice....especially if money is on the line.....a little extra work reaps the rewards.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I have compile everything spudfyre have posted. It is almost 80 pages long. Well, there are a lot of information. I am going to read this entire thread the second time. I MUST master this. Once I get familiar, I want to build a volume alert so that we don't have to sit and stare at the screen all time.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Forget to attach the attachment. Here it is.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Very Nice.Thank your sharing.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi spudfyre Thank you for your kindly sharing.Please provide more information about your think for red line and green line from volume picture.How u decision for that. And does it can apply for other cross peak volume price.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
VPLT - Failing Price Climb Using the chart below the green trend lines on price show rising price. The green trend lines on volume show rising volume. The areas I marked "Tail" is where the volume drops off. This is a sure sign that climbing price is failing. That is one way to look at this chart. On the price, the trend lines follow a price up. On the volume, the trend lines seem to support a climbing price and volume seems to get weaker when price drops.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Same chart as before only this time I put in 3 red price and volume trend lines. The first price/volume seems to support an upward price move, since volume is getting less as price goes down. You could definitely get tricked here into going into a long trade, as low as you could below 1.3375, you would recover later as you would see the market turn to short from both the volume falling off the price/volume climb that follows (shown in previous chart), or with what happens next. The second price trend line is relatively flat, you could give it a little up trend, but certainly no down trend. Meanwhile volume slides down. This is the market not interested in this higher price...a small ceiling around the 1.3380 price. Here is a definite short entry at 1.3380 or anywhere above our price level of 1.3375. The 3rd price/volume trend lines seal the short deal. Even if you ignore the price drop and focus solely on the last 3 candles climbing, volume is not there to support the price climb. If the market had any interest in going up, the volume would have increased with price, at best volume stays flat. So, taking all 3 groups together: The first price/volume group is the end of the previous long climb. Still some market momentum trying to move the price higher. The 2nd price/volume group sets the ceiling of upward price movement and gives all in the market notice..."that's it". The 3rd price/volume group is the gathering of short orders at 1.3375 and then the price will drop. Now don't go expecting the market is going to drop 50-100 pips every time the market wants the price to drop. Not on this chart but soon after, the price drops 10-15 pips and then the price/volume turns again and goes into a steady climb. You grab your pips and trade with the market....not what you forecast the market will do...what the market is doing.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
VPLT - A Tough One Here's a tough one to catch, but the market does tell you....so long as you don't create bias for one direction and listen to the market. It even fooled me while I was writing this! There looks to be a lot of support for a price climb on this chart. Rising price, rising volumes.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
There is no doubt support for a climbing price to 1.3390. Candle (1) is of interest, if only because volume is so low at 1.3390. Certainly the fall in price next to it should be expected. Candle (1) is at the end of a typical "tail" that I spoke wrote about earlier where price is climbing and volume falls off at the end of the price climb. Candle (2) crosses 1.3390 with a volume peak. This price level seems strong as there is growing volume to this peak, but what follows the peak is a drop in price. Here you might enter a long trade and likely get stopped out by candle (3) if you didn't bail at the previous candle before (3). Candle (2) to (3) is a market supporting the 1.3880 price level. At the very least you should be scratching your head at the volume spike of candle (3) being so high when it doesn't touch 1.3390. Instead it, fell climbed through 1.3385 and fell through 1.3380. Go back to candles (1) and (2) and this seems to make a little more sense. So candle (4) looks like a breakthrough up. And it is, this price/volume is supporting a market to go from 1.3380 to 1.3390. This is where you need to focus on what the market interest has been on 1.3390...not very strong. Like candle (1) and like candle (2) ....candle (4) should be followed with a price drop....and it is (not on chart). This is one that will likely fool you because so much bias will be seen on the price climb. However, if you think about this long enough, you can see the top price weakness.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Spud, I dont know if my logic is right. Im considering the PL is something like magnet As the price is going to that level, the volume is going up. And as the price going past( crossed) or bounce away from that level, the volume is going down. Is it right to think that way?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hey Spud! Nice to see you back, I remember you from my "lurking days", obviously I'm just now stepping out of the shadows myself. You have a really interesting thread going, but some things need clearing. You went long in candle 4 and candle 27, I'd describe the situation in those 2 trades quite similar - declining price with dropping interest (volume), therefore a pull to upper price line. In hindsight they are good scalps, justifiable entries as the price takes off after that. But if I look at candle 19, the same thing happens - price drops, volume drops, you even say it yourself that "market still showing it doesn't like being below 1.3055". My question is why are you neglecting a long order there? I believe it to be consistent with the whole teaching that there should be a long trade at candle 19, even though it would prove to be a loss. Bar with arrow is nr 16. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...6&amp;d=1357784589 Your clarification and comment most appreciated!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Reading post #288-291. I feel like the market is on the race track. The engine is running at full speed but the race car has not moved yet. The gear has not been engaged yet. And all the sudden it thrusts... It is a PL &amp; PV formation that needs to be documented in my trading journal. I am a big fan of pattern, as it gives the most up to date signals.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Just want to make a few comments studying this system. 1. If the bar moves and volume low, it is a sign of traders taking profits. Strong sign of reversing trend. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that traders close trades and don't open new contract. 2. Bar small and volume high means that market is going to move. It is like race car on the race track gasing up for the signal to start and thrust. 3. Spud has mentioned that VPLT is relative. By that he probably means the volume and price are relative and you should also read the volume and price in a block of few bars. You have to refer to other surrounding bars and see what the marketing is trying to do. 4. For 10-30 pips (depending on market session), it will take you 2-3 hours of trading in average. From my statistical studies, if you aim for 50 pips or more, you will need to trade 2 times, one entry for 20 pips and the other one entry for 30 pips. Or, 3 entries of 15, 15, 20. It all depends on the market sessions you are trading in. 5. When the market is in trending mood, it will take 1-2 hours to settle. Then you can read the chart and do your analysis to determine the new PL. 6. Volume is the market's Interest, it is also the market's Intention. Learn to read it and you can get into the mind of the market. Never goes against its Interest and Intention or it will draw money from your account. Hope this summary helps some one and look at this VPLT from another anchor.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Right idea. I was even going to use that analogy

--- 帖子 #297 ---
You could go long at 19, but you also have to wonder what 20 is going to look like if the volume is lower (a failed climb?) or higher (a downward price move?)....lot of questions here so I'd watch 19 and 20, which pops in a new peak and price level. We keep seeing failures of support for the higher price levels forming. They reach up and fail, reach up and fail. That's why the long doesn't look too good.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Auto Grid Indicator. Automatically draw line on 0 and 5 prices.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Let me attempt to summarize it in a few sentences like in the condition in EA programming. 1. The VPLT system uses volume, price &amp; price level to determine the interest of the market. 2. Buy when the market has interest in higher price 2a. When the price is below the price level, it builds up volume toward the price level. Or 2b. When the price is above the price level, it builds up volume moving away (upward) from the price level. 3. Sell when the market has interest in lower price 3a. When the price is above the price level, it builds up volume toward the price level. Or 3b. When the price is below the price level, it builds up volume moving away (downward) from the price level. You can see / use the volume as fuel for the price to move in any particular direction. More fuel, more power to move. If the market wants the price to move in a particular direction, you will see the market fuel it with volume. I hope this is clear enough for people to catch the concept.

Here's a little something on volume divergence I use alongside SR levels. Similar theme to reading volume bars.

Hi Spudfyre - thanks for sharing your interesting and original way of looking at volume. I'm looking forward to trying it out in real time Regards Islander

I think this method actually needs a video with live trading and you speaking your mind and thought process spudfyre? The pictures sort of clarify what your thinking but they are cherry picked so to speak of perfect setups and you can see the end result. When people see a video with the unknown price on the screen and and you speaking over the top on your thoughts, things may just fall into place. But when your scrolling your screen around trying to match post text to pictures further along the thread it just gets confusing on what your meant to be doing. Your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
marine1983 has got a point. that is how i study the system. It is rather hard to follow at times. I have to go thru it 2 times.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hey all, If you are a little or a lot confused about Spudfyre's examples I would suggest just looking at the running trade commentary on page 17. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...402865&amp;page=17 This is a very good example to follow and will give some insight on the thought process behind the trade. Also, just follow the rules, if you are breaking the rules it will take you longer to "get it". If you need additional help identifying price volume levels, drop down to the 5 min chart and locate the high volume bar there or find willowgals candle indicator and use that. Both will work. My preference is to just follow Spudfyre's instructions, they work.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Not been much to get excited about today on the EURUSD - stuck in a 30 pip range all day so far!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
The thought of a video is there. It may be that I will do a few, as it would be a lot less drawing and writing. Bear with me, you may find that a video isn't necesary as we get rolling along here.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Nice article and indicator. I'll have to look at it more. Incorporated with price levels (as you elude to SR levels), it may be an interesting way to identify the price/volume movements. Pretty sure I wouldn't trade it the way it is presented, a few holes exist....but there is a lot there that is correct.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
And another one. Similar theme price and volume tell the story. Just look at the rising volume and price under label C after price and volume flat-lined between B and C. Note the rising volume from the pa that took out the previous swing low up to B trapping sellers. This was preceded by volume getting weaker on the previous leg down (volume divergence). Would love to hear your criticisms of the first article spud. Doing well islander - thank you.

I've edited the first post, to hopefully provide a clearer focus of what Volume Price Level Trading is and means. I fear that some people reading this forum may miss the importance of the "price level" in the title, and just as true I may have not clearly included in my explanations the importance of price levels and their relation with volumes. How volumes and price react to a price level is the key to succesful trading. Volume (market interest) will be highest at a specific price level and tend to range around this price level sustaining high volumes. Weaker price levels, will have less volume (market interest) and price will tend to be more volatile, bouncing all over and move through these weaker price levels. The simple way to make pips is seize the opportunity of trading to and from the stronger price levels. A price level itself is not exact. It is arbitrary, a range. Though there is significantly more interest around the "0" and "5" prices (1.3300, 1.3305, 1.3310, etc), so it is prudent to focus our price levels on these prices. The second task is to dtermine where the price levels are and then which price level teh price is attracted to the most by looking at price/volume interaction. My future explanations and examples will focus more on explaining this interaction, as I believe this is where some confusion lays. There are also some very specific price/movements to price levels that are extremely consistent (even pattern like), that may help traders who prefer a more systematic approach to trading.

Spud, I would be really interested which price levels you marked today from this chart ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #317 ---
First post got me thinking of one article I read lately, it's here http://www.investopedia.com/articles...#axzz2IkU97gll That should easen finding the strongest price levels, or do you disagree Spud? The pic is from the same article, rather self-explanatory http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...vBCharts_2.GIF

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thank you spud for putting a note on the importance of the Price Level. Using your system, I find PL is a moving target. The london session has very big spike while the asia has relatively small volume spike. Wish to know how you would read the chart presented by Willowgal. It is so volatile. I use 5 mins chart to ride it thru. But was caught by the smaller the volume spike in the end of the london session. I thought it was noise.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Fantastic thread Spud! The way you describe how to trade this way is really good. Really like the way you use volume (interest), throws a different approach to the market. Read through the thread once but will read through several more times to grasp the idea more. Once step at a time, so first I'd like to know if these PL are right?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
This is the update from the earlier picture I uploaded. This is the first time I've actually placed any PL, but I reckon I got close to being spot on with them. I'm going to try drawing a few more as the week goes on. Once I feel comfortable I can place PL properly and it becomes second nature, then I'm going to learn how to decide which direction a trade will go. The markets are not going anywhere so I'm going to take my time, learn each step properly. As Spud says, the devil is in the detail. Saf

Hi All, This is how I played out and marked up my chart yesterday. It would of been a succesfull trade. Oh how I wish it was a live account. Ignore the lot size used to trade I realise its high risk etc I just clicked buy and left it to see if I got the direction right. Willowgal this sort of answers your questions to spud also. Its my take on what went on yesterday. I have attached a pic and my thought process. Lines A, B are peak volumes to get a base for price levels. At line C I set a price line at 1.32850. I know this only intersects 1 bar. But price seems to hit resistance so I thought it was a good level to place. Bar 1. bar is up. Volume is down. But reading spuds post after a spike bar, volume is always less. So expected. Bar 2. Bar is up. Volume is also slightly higher. (Or equal its hard to tell with bar 1's volume) starting to lean to a buy bias. Which also matches what the chart is doing. Bar 3. Bar is up. Volume down. Though as this bar is also small in size I expect the volume bar to be lower in height. Still no trade decision. Bar 4. Bar Down. Volume down. This time the volume is also less than Bar 3. To me this is proving its a buy situation. Bar 5. I enter a buy at the opening of this bar. My target is 1.33102. I didnt set a TP for this trade. I'm only trying to guess the direction at the moment. The reason I chose this target? Look at support at E. The price line sticks to the rules it ends in a 0 and price was affected at this price level. It was a support line until was broken through. In hindsight looking at the charts today my TP line was spot on. Price returned to this line this morning around 8.45am GMT today. I know this is not exactly how spud trades and explained but its what I felt is right for the situation. Adding a little supply and demand theory it worked out. Now to be consistent Time will tell.

There is a systematic approach you can take to establishing price levels. The nice thing about doing it this way, is that you almost always find the "perfect" price level for a trade entry. Rarely is the takedown greater than 5 pips and will rarely go beyond 10-15 pips, if you have the price direction right from the price level. We know that at every volume peak, the volume after the peak is always down - this is a given truth and must. This price candle after the volume peak actually carries a lot of meaning to Price Level -- I call it the "Determinator" price candle and you will see why if you try it. Here's how to establish a price level based on the volume peak price candle and the price candle ("Determinator") that follows: 1. Find the volume peak and corresponding price candle 2. The next price candle "Determinator" draw your price level as close to the open of this candle as possible "ending in "5" or "0" 2a. A down Determinator candle's price level is from open, downward (never up). 2b. An up Determinator candle's price level is from open, upward (never down). 2c. Ideally (or 95% or greater), the price level will intersect through the Determinator candle 3. Option - when the Price Level is so close to the open, but breaks the #2 rule, you can selct this Price Level; aware that it may require a larger stop or may make you miss a trade entry - when I say close..I mean within 1-2 pips. Trading With This Price Level Trade entry is only from this established Price Level. Sometimes, price won't hit your price level, and as long as the trade is staying in the dirction you chose, you can enter further off this price level on rare occurances. So, let's say you establish a Price Level in the Determinator candle at 1.3310 but price keeps ranging around 1.3305, then it is ok to jump on the entry at this lower price....keep in mind greater stops required (+5-10) and less pips will be made. I find it is just better to miss the trade and wait for a new Price Level. a whole lot safer and more successful. Typically these trades easily net 10-15 pips on a regular basis with a 15 pip stop. If you cycle them together you can see continuing trend support runs and make more pips. I usually don't chase beyond 20-25 pips without very good reason. Continually grab 5-10 pips is a great strategy if you have no idea of price direction. If you think you picked the wrong trade direction but are in positive pips...take the pips....don't sit there and wait. Definitely safe to get out if you sense a new price level forming. Give it a try, I think you will be surprised how well it works in establishing price level. Obviously, we can use VPLT to better establish trade direction...and more on this with charts to follow.

Hello Spud I'm glad to see you back on FF. Have you evere heard of PVP (Peak Volume Price) and it's use with Market Statistics ? If not information is mostly available on traderslaboratory http://www.traderslaboratory.com/for...-weighted.html and the whole group of threads is listed in http://www.traderslaboratory.com/for...ks.htmlhttp:// Here in FF you can find a PVP indicator in http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=189511 ,do you think that using the Peak Volume Price could be useful with your strategy ?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
You are so right spud. I have been using VPLT these few days. And, 10-15 pips is a safe gain. Previously, my tp is to big and ended up losing it back. Thank god I didn't let go negative.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Thanks Koopa, this has totally absorbed me all evening :nerd: I've never seen it adapted as an MT4 indicator.

[quote=Spudfyre;6388315]There is a systematic approach you can take to establishing price levels. The nice thing about doing it this way, is that you almost always find the "perfect" price level for a trade entry. Rarely is the takedown greater than 5 pips and will rarely go beyond 10-15 pips, if you have the price direction right from the price level. .............................................................................................................................................. 2a. A down Determinator candle's price level is from open, downward (never up). 2b. An up Determinator candle's price level is from open, upward (never down). 2c. Ideally (or 95% or greater), the price level will intersect through the Determinator candle 3. Option - when the Price Level is so close to the open, but breaks the #2 rule, you can selct this Price Level; aware that it may require a larger stop or may make you miss a trade entry - when I say close..I mean within 1-2 pips. Hi Spud, Thanks again for a very informative post, but I must admit that I am a bit at a loss with the points 2a and 2b. Must be the ageing of the grey matter. If you don't mind, would you care to illustrate this by means of a chart. Much appreciated. Regards Pete

Include some EU chart with price grid to help you practice. Print the chart out and do some practice and you should be able to read the market like a book. There is simply no surprise in the market. Everything is the price level volume. Attached is the example.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Will do. Was going to last night but got side tracked on the indicator Koopa posted [quote=pete123;6389474]

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Do you have a price grid indicator that can draw lines at those specific numbers, the 0's and 5's?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hey guys I understand that you all get excited with all the methods how to determine a PL. But don't we all agree that this is the simple part of the method? I would like to see more of the other stuff... Spud you know what I mean... right? :-)

--- 帖子 #332 ---
My point exactly! Most of the time I get PLines very close, 5 pips apart, so how are you supposed to trade those? Sometimes there's a volume and price spike simultaenously, and as a result it slices through 2 PLines in one go. Confusing situation... I understand that explaining price/volume moves is more of a dynamic thing, all little things add up, but what are the rock-solid rules which apply in each and every time? Stating those in a clear and concise manner will help to grasp this method better I think.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Visualizing VPLT Now that I know there is a MT4 Volume Weighted Average Pricing (VWAP) indicator, we can get a great visualization of VPLT at work. The chart below shows the VWAP from the 2 highest volume peaks and a later volume peak. I'm using the two highest volume peaks for ease of visualization, other volume peaks are still valid and would show the same thing. The Price Levels are established using the systematic price level approach where the candle after the volume peak candle ("Determinator candle") is used to determine the price level as the price that ends in "0" or "5" closest to the Determinator candle. So we have 3 price levels on this chart marked with red dashed lines. Price moves to price levels. Price levels are a magnet, price is attracted to the strongest magnet. Volume is the strength of the magnet, low volume is a weak magnet, strong volume is a strong magnet. If there is very low volume than price levels have no power and price will "float" waiting for volume to rise (price level magnet to turn on). Price will move to the closest magnet with volume. The writing in the chart should allow you to see how all this interacts.

Spud, It will be nice if you can kindly post the MT4 Volume Weighted Average Pricing (VWAP) indicator for us to play around. Thanx a lot for everything. I have summarized / created a VPLT terminology document for those who wish to practice drawing on the chart i attached on page 22.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Oh man. Is it just me or i still don't understand the interaction between the price, volume and the price level.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Yicktan, I am replying from my iPhone so I can't post the indicator but you'll find it in the Ff thread linked in my previous post. In the Market Statistics v4.1 indicator you'll be able to draw VWAP and PVP but you have to indicate a starting hour from which the calculation is made (usually people put the start of London, NY or Tokyo sessions). The way this particular indicator is made makes it useful for daytrading, I wish I had a version easily used with H4 for example. Spud looks more interested in the VWAP even if at first I showed him this indicator for its use of the PVP ( Peak Volume Price). But I guess we will get in that direction one day or another...

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I didn't post it because I just wanted to use the VWAP portion to visualize price levels on the chart. There are lot of other things in the indicator and settings. I'm not familiar with the indicator enough to know the workings of it, but as a visualization tool it is great.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I can almost catch the movement of the market with VPLT. However, the market almost caught me with 20 odd pips. Really wonder what is the idea entries points. I guess I will still need to sharpen my skill. Don't like to get caught with 10-20 pips swing in the opposite direction before thrusting in the direction i traded for. I find this VPLT system is super good for ranging market. But how to trade the trend with this? Spoted a volume divergence. Wonder if any of you see it.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi, thanks Spudfyre for teaching about price and volume. Please take a look at attched chart. Is the reasoning oversimpified or ok you think? And thanks to Yicktan aswell for all valuable posting. Regards Waez http://i46.tinypic.com/34j4n7m.gif

--- 帖子 #341 ---
The interaction is this: Volume moves higher or lower. Price moves higher or lower. Volume is lower the futher price is away from a "price level" until price is attracted to a new "price level", then volume will increase and price moves towards this new "price level" Look at the chart I posted in Post #334: From 8:00 to 11:30 volume declines, so volume moves lower As volume moves lower, price moves away from 1.3300 (our price level on the chart) From 11:30 to 12:45, volume moves higher.....so price is attracted to 1.3300? (NO), a higher price level? (Yes) So you trade long, looking for a new volume peak, which will form a new price level, that will be higher than the current price. If the volume goes down and price goes down? Do you bail or do you buy more long? (More Long) If the volume goes up and price moves down? ...now start looking for the new lower price level, if you can find it, now start looking at overall volume...this will determine if you stop, or you will hit a lower and weaker price level...i.e. will price now bounce up or not? If you can find a price level down here within 10-20 pips of your trade entry, then you have room to play. If you can't find a price level down here, or it is way down... then you look to bail at the best opportune time...don't go beyond 20 pips loss. Tips: Volume does not determine direction of market price alone Price levels and volume strength is where price will move too Even though price levels change and price moves, look for where price is attracted too (ie. what is volume doing) - don't look at every price move as "this is it, market is going to go way down"....just look at each small move as it happens and evaluate...lots of small moves = big move. The thing about VPLT is that it tells you what is going to happen next...not 2 hours from now.....next. If you get ahead of yourself and start forecasting and guessing, then you are no longer VPLT trading....you are forecasting and guessing. VPLT is "now" trading. Not historical, not forecasting. VPLT will, if you are paying attention, and read it right, tell you exactly what the market is going to do -- to the next price level. Volume Price Where is price? What price level is it near? What is volume doing when price is near/at this price level? Go back to the chart at Post #334. Just look at the "general" price moves between price levels and what the volume is doing. Price breaks away from one price level and goes to the next...what does volume do? (I've porposely spaced out the price levels in the chart for visual clarity, price levels do exist inbetween) Volume is relative. So you can actually trade these big price level gaps as they are on the chart and focus only on the highest volume peaks. But the devil will always remain in the detail inbetween, to know here price is headed.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
10-20 pip swings are fine. You have to give your trade some room to move...price can steer like a big boat, the turn is made but the boat won't make a change in direction right away. Here is where you glue your face to volumes. I'll get hit with 10-20 pip swings and can usually recover from a "bad" trade with less than 10 pip loss as price swings in a candle. I'll stop out at 20 pips about 1-40/50 rades. I'll stop out about 10% of the time under 10 pips. I'll only see swings greater than 5-7 pips ...maybe 10-15% of the time. Trend trades - move your stop and treat every new price level as a trade...but keep your trade going or add more trades positions. Why play retracements. Trends retrace, so either take advantage and trade the retrace, or get out and wait for the trend to continue. Ohhh, so much more profitable.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
In essence, yes...it is that simple. What you have to watch here is that volume weakens as price moves away from 1.3450, and strengthens again as price moves toward 1.3450...so the trade is a simple "from" to 1.3450

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thanks Spydfyre, the chart developes and a new price level is identified @ 1.3465 which goes through C, D and E. After E again no interest in lower price (2) so looking for to buy. Price is between to price levels, where to look for entrance? Regards Waez http://i48.tinypic.com/2zqzjfn.gif

--- 帖子 #345 ---
These trading info that you share are simply priceless. Most of the trade swing I am in are in the range of 10-15 pips. That means I still have to pay more attention to the details. Yes, I do recover from the bad trade. This system is the Price Action system, it tell you what the market wants and where it is heading (NOW). I just love it. Prior to this, I thought the trendline is the only system that is PA based but VPLT is PA and the best part is that it tells you what the markets want. This is simply as good as the the ATM. Even though I have not fulling master it yet, but I will be very very soon. Your advice on the trend trades is sound. I move my stop and I don't let it goes against me. I do loss some opportunities, but money in my pocket is better than trying to earn it back from the broker. A tip for the newbies trading VPLT, always use TP and SL, this is a PA system. Price moves very fast and you have no time to think and act most of the time. Some broker keeps requoting and it is no good to do it manually. FXDD requotes like hell and the order server freeze in active trading time, I still make small money from it using Pending Orders, SL and TP. I still trade this very annoying platform to help train my trading discipline which is always trading with a plan. Know you trading plan, know what is your SL and TP.

A series of charts follow what is a walk through of the entire VPLT interaction. I'm taking a slightly different approach to explaining the volume, price and price level interaction. Nothing has changed, it is just a slightly different way to look at the same thing, but I believe it should be a lot easier to follow. Chart 1 We'll start with this chart and I will explain how you can see where price will go through the entire chart. Near the end, we'll treat the price moves as "unknowns" not showing the next candle but giving you 100% confidence in knowing where the price will go....and then we'll see it. On the first chart we find a volume peak and establish a price level. We can see that after the volume peak, volume and price are relatively flat. Price is simply moving up and down around our price level for 4 price candles. If you see a second volume peak just 2 volume bars after our first volume peak, pat yourself on the back for seeing the devil in the details. I ignored it, for visual explanation reasons. But we can conclude, if you study it, that it simply supports our price level. It isn't important so ignore it if it is easier. Then volume increase and price moves down and away from our price level. What we now conclude is that price is attracted to a new price level lower than the current one. This is the "what we now know" decision of VPLT. So, a short trade entry is best right here. Our stop is our price level or 5 pips above our price level (about 9 pips total). Our take profit is 10 pips (1:1 risk/earnings), or the new price level. This can be re-evaluated as we go.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
So you can see where we made out short entry actually turned into a volume peak and established what we expected to be, a new price level. So, now this is the relevant price level that volumes refer too. What to do about our short trade? You could exit, if you can take profit or zero - that's the safe smart move. If you can't get out without being negative, you might as well go for the ride. We still have plenty of stop loss space. Grab pips when you can. If you ride the volume down,price down trend, make sure you move your stop lower - this is all about keeping profit so make your stop keeps you in profit and expect price to turn against you when that volume rises. This time around volume falls and price falls away from our new, relevant price level (1.3365). This means that price is not attracted to a new lower price level, it will return and move back towards our new current relevant price level. So, now the trade is long. As long as volume goes down , price will go down. You can anticipate that volume will increase and what you are looking for to enter that long trade is a volume up, price up situation, this will mean that price is attracted back to our new and current 1.3365 price level. That is the ideal long trade entry.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
The volume up, price up that occurred was a doozy. Huge price drop, great if you kept the short and took the pips. Horrible if you jumped into an early long trade without waiting for the volume up, price up move. This is the lesson - trade VPLT on the now, not what you think will happen, not what has happened. It is extremely hard to do.....I fall into the trap a lot - so expect that you will too. Assuming you took the long entry at the price up, volume up. You are now in a long trade around 1.3358 Now we have 3 price up candles in a row, and what looks like a volume up, price up situation where price is attracted to a new and higher price level. Correct! And so we can assume that price level is already the one we know about at 1.3365. So, the way it unfolds is this: Volume up, price up after a series of volume down, price down - looking for price to climb back towards our 1.3365 price level - enter long trade Volume down, price up - creates a new price level at 1.3360, we are now looking for positive pips in our long trade, stop loss up Volume up, price up - maintains our original theory that price would move to 1.3365 This also indicates that price is attracted to a higher price level than the one just created at 1.3360, so grab your pips at 1.3365 or move your stop up and look for even higher gains. Now, the next candle is volume down, price down which should have stopped any long trade in a profit pip situation. It also confirms our new price level again at 1.3360. What is happening? The price attraction with the up candles and 2 volume peaks seem to suggest an attraction to rising price, but that is incorrect. Even though price rose, the volume peaks are confirming the new and lower 1.3360 price level -- this is very important. The volume up, price up that we see is not a price attraction to a higher price level. They are if you like, a divergence in volume/price -- and we know what that means -- price will fall. So it comes to pass and price falls after the 3rd volume up, price up and we have established 1.3360 and we are in a short trade if we are smart and caught the divergence. Volume takes a rise, price falls more and now we are on our way again to another new price level probably lower than 1.3360.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
We have a new lower price level formed at 1.3350. Volume goes flat and price ranges at 1.3350. Then we see a dip in volume and price go up. That is relevant in 2 ways, but neither surprising. The first is the standard volume down, price up means that price is not attracted to a higher price level, so 1.3350 is relevant. The second, is that this candle comes after a volume peak....small peak but important non-the-less to confirm the 1.3350 price level with the upward moving price and downward volume. So, 1.3350 is now the relevant price level for volumes to relate too. You can see we have chugged through a number of price levels and they were relevant and meaningful in their own time space, but VPLT is "here and now" trading. So, the only relevant price level right "now" is 1.3350. Now volume is down and price is up for 3 candles. So, price is moving up and away from 1.3350, but is not attracted to a new higher price level. So, we expect to see that if volume increases, price will fall. However, if volume rises and price continues to rise, then a new price level is attracting our price and we can expect to see price move to a new, higher price level.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Here we are, finally, at the end of this chart. We can see nothing surprising here. General volume up, price up, new relevant price levels that are higher. At the last candle, the candle is down and it established a price level at the higher 1.3365 level. Since this is the candle after a volume peak, we know volume will be down and with price down. The 1.3365 price level is the go to trade to value. So this is a long trade entry. Our goal is to retrace to 1.3365 or higher. As long as volume rises and price rises we are good. You can and should wait for this to happen.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Here we have what we expected, volume up, price up...long trade established. So, old tune by now we'll head to our relevant price level and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Volume up, price up....price headed to a new price level. And so we go on, in this same manner. A few tricky spots to think over in all that, but for the most part the market was extremely predictable. It may seem that we are chasing 2-3 pip trades, but that is not the case. VPLT tells us what is happening now, so we can only look as far ahead as now. The danger is to start forecasting (guessing) where the market is going. There was a movie I once saw about a guy that could see 15 minutes into the future, that is what VPLT is. Our trades are entered on the basis to take pips, to suffer no losses, and never hit our stops in a negative pip situation. We need to keep re-evaluating and using that small window we have into the future to take our pips or go for more. What you saw in these last 7 or so charts just continues on. Sometimes, you have to pause and think, look at the details. Sometimes, it's just another volume up, price up, new price level kind of day.

This last series of charts/posts was very helpful. It is definitely starting to make a bit of sense now. Thanks Spud!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Spud, I just made a review on the most quiet day of the week (21 Jan 13), and below is my points of view. The two PLs I take note is 3320 and 3305. Could you please help criticize whether my understanding does really make sense? I have a problem to fully understand candle 15 !!! Candle (1): Price down, Volume pick. Determine the PL at 3320 Candle (2): Price up, Volume down. Confirm the 3320 PL Candle (3): Price down, Volume down. Less interest in price moving down away from 3320 Candle (4): Price down, Volume up. Seeking a new PL 3310 or 3305. Candle (5): Price up, Volume up. Interest to go back to 3320. Long may be placed here, target 3320 or some pips more Candle (6): Price up, Volume down. Price cross 3320, but no interest to go further up. Confirm PL 3320. Candle (7): Price up, Volume down. Very less interest for price to go up further. Short bias in place. Candle (8): Price down, Volume up. This is already expected. Interest to go back to 3320. Short should be taken here, target 3310 Candle (9): Price down, Volume up. Interest to find a new PL, but still confirm 3320 for now. Candle (10): Price down, Volume up. PL 3310 and 3305 now in loop. Candle (11): Price up, Volume down. Predetermine 3305 as new PL. Candle (12): Price up, Volume down. Confirm PL 3305. Candle (13): Price down, Volume down. Less interest to go below 3305. Candle (14): Price up, Volume up. More interest to go up. Long bias in place, as whenever volume is always higher when price up. Candle (15): Price up, Volume down. I need help here, why does the volume is too low in this case, and it was followed by a big up candle? http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/k...ps38e5e3da.jpg Thank you very much,

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Spud Thank you very very much for your last example sequence. Now I'm starting to get you. The new way you explained the events is much clearer for me to understand. I started to do some chart reading and it looks like I'm getting some success. I think what makes the difference now is the "here and now" that I started to pay more attention to. Thanks Spud!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Spud It's beginning to make a lot of sense reading each and every candle with it's volume. You begin to see how the market repeats it's behavior until it's ready for take off to the next price level. Thank you Spud for showing us this method. I feel empowered now because I know with each candle what the market is doing or where it's interest lie. This is why it's so powerful. Cannot thank you enough for taking the time to go through chart by chart explanation. Thanks and best wishes Jess

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Jess, The most logical way to explain this candle is that the price tries to push down but fail and close high. As you can see that there is a long tail. A bit tricky. But sometimes, you have to observe how the candle is being formed. I will read this as no interest down candle.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Take another look at 13, 14 and 15. What is 14? 14 is a volume peak, and after every volume peak we have a......volume down. With every volume peak we have a price level. That's what happened there. The rest of your analysis is good.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hi Spud, Thank you very much for your reply. Do you mind if you can help elaborate more on your point? From my view, candle 15 is rejecting with low volume to move up away the PL 3305. Sorry to ask you again, but I keep confusing myself. Thank you,

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Candles 10 and 11 establish the 1.3305 (so do 4 &amp; 5) 11,12,13 are doing what you'd expect and simply supporting 1.3305 14 and 15 confirm 1.3305 The tail falls off after 8,9,10 where volume climbs and price drops, 11-15 are the end of the downward momentum Price charged down to 1.3305, and the market likes this, volume was up, price down. Price was moving down and away from 1.3320 and was attracted to a new price level which ended up being 1.3305. At 1.3305 price tries to move away from 1.3305 and there is no where to go. Market isn't interested and price is not being attracted to a higher or lower level as it breaks away from 1.3305. The real move is to wait at 1.3305. You could go long, but not short after 15 as I'd use the tail break away as a sure sign of downward exhaustion. If you missed that move and settled on waiting until 16 finished, you'd go long as volume up, price up is an obvious attraction to a new price level. That is a lot easier to see. That's the move I'd go for. The climb to 1.3320 is very straightforward after that.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hi Spud, Thank you so much for your explanation. I will keep learning about this invaluable knowledge of the Volume Price trading technique. This really helps me understand what the market is doing!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Spud, It's me again. I do have a chance to follow the market today. I'm actually a bit confused about candle 1, should I take a long trade right after candle 1? Because from my thinking, I see there is more interest to go long at the end of candle 1 (Price up, Volume up), with support from the prior candle and PL 3435. However, it will be a loss when candle 3 spikes down. Is it ok to accept this loss, or my decision is wrong? Or does it mean the long leg of candle 1 shows the long interest is now losing to the short interest? Thank you very much, http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/k...ps6ab7a23a.png

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Grrr missed my TP my a pip lol Good job its a demo account. Though got the direction right. Then it shot the other way.... I sold at the down arrow start of the bar. Volume had increased as price went down.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Does the issue that volume is not aggregated with Interbank traders bother any of you who use Volume? I ask because it's scared me off the use of volume outside of stock trading. I assume you feel the retail volume flows mirror big money flows? Or that retail flows drive the market, particularly in smaller time frames?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi marine1983 mhh... well I can't see a short trade where you entered. the candle prior of your entry bar, was a up bar on higher volume. If anything it looks more like a long. But with that long upper wick I think I would have sit on the sidelines. If I look at FX_Starter89 chart (post 367). I think I would have taken a long after bar nr.3 The chart reading I did over the weekend showed me some good trades when a pinbar developed over a Price Level on high volume. Just like bar nr.3 But please Spud let us know your opinion on this chart. Thanks

--- 帖子 #370 ---
The reason why I entered I could be wrong. Sorry I have corrected the picture the arrow is now in the correct place. The candle before was a spinning top. Price was on the lines and not going anywhere. Volume was lower than the previous candle showing weakness in price going higher. So I eneterd a sell on the indicated bar. The next candle was up and so was volume. I guess I should have got out at BE. But Im playing and testing at the mo. The next 2 candles were down but volume increased showing that the price wanted to go lower. Which it did and missed by a pip. I had set TP/SL to 10 pips showing a 1:1 reward. Im using a trade manager EA for setting this. All I have to do is pull the trigger. Looking at the chart further along my price line is spot on which is important to me. The price comes back to it and has another big rejection showing a perfect supply demand area. As long as the basics are right, with chart time it will come. This method is the only one that makes sense and logical. No lagging indicator. Just the mk1 brain and trade what you see.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Now I can follow you. Yes charttime will give us experience. Experience will tell us if a spinning top is a no go and if we're better off to wait for the next candle. Sure Spud will have some more hints for us.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Your right. Volume/price is relativity....worked for Einstein to define the universe, relativity should work well for trading

--- 帖子 #373 ---
The move to 1 is interest in a new price level, at candle 1 you should be long. At candle 2, that's the confirmation of a price level for 1.3440. You have to take the candle and volume (which will always drop) after a volume peak as establishing the price level first and foremost. Forget the #3 candle tail and focus on the the volume price from candle -2 to candle 2 at close. The strength "here and now", everything you know is at price level 1.3440...so that has to be your play. Don't guess what the market might do. So, you should be long somewhere around 1.3440. Your stop somewhere around 1.3425 to 1.3430. Even if you got stopped from #3, it would be wise to take a long from 1.3435 on #3 (or lower) to chase it up and back towards our 1.3440 price level. When price is creating this huge down candle 10 pips away from our price level...you got to play what you know. At the end of 3, it all makes sense for long. Look at the closes of price (1-3)...up...volume up. (use that trend line). You should be in a long and riding 4 to the next price level. At 5, your stop is moved way up to at least 1.3460 and you are a pip magnet.

VPLT is actually much easier to play in "real time trading", so long as you don't get ahead of the market and start guessing what will happen next. You are correct, nothing beats chart time. The nice thing about volume is; it is steadily progressive...i.e. volume can only stop or increase inside a candle, never decrease. The dangerous part, not waiting long enough for the candle to close...or be extremely close to close before making a decision. Their can be some serious price moves in the last 2 minutes of a 15 minute candle...don't get ahead of the game.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi Spud, I don't quite get the logic for a long entry around 1.3440. What is the logic to go long? Candle -4 is a down peak. Candle 3 is also a down peak. There is nothing in between -4 - 3 to support long, no indication of long because all the volume prior to candle 3 are lower than the peak at -4. If you use the level jump between -3 to 2, won't it be a weak level too? Hope you can elaborate more on this.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi Spud, Thank you very much for your comments. Could you help explain more about "The move to 1 is interest in a new price level, at candle 1 you should be long."? I'm just not clear about the entry point? Is it at candle 1 open or close? How can we confirm a long at candle 1, because as you mentioned candle 1 just tries to target the new PL 3440? At candle 3 close, I agree with you that it is very clear for a long entry, and I actually did. Regards,

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Yicktan, From my point of view, candle -3 is a strong pull up, candle -2 shows less interest to go down, and candle -1 finally rejects the PL 3435 with long wick. This is why I start looking for a long entry...! Maybe Spud can give us some better idea. Regards,

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi Spud, I am a newbie and I would like to thank you for sharing this excellent approach in trading. Although it's still hard for me to chew but I am pretty sure to have a better understanding when going through. Again, thank you Spudfyre! I am looking forward to your next explanation/comments.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
If I look back at the eu chart, most of the time a candle with long wick + volume is a sign of reversal but it is not a sure sign. We really need a better way to explain / identify things. Also, sometimes, a peak volume is followed by a bigger volume. You won't know what is next in the "here now" approach. Sometimes, a no interest up / down is followed by more up / down. We have to have more condition on explaining things. Like trading hours, like how long to trade, like tp, like how long to wait after one trade is closed, like what to do when we are in the trade. Are we riding the trend or are we scalping for small pips. Also what are the warning sign of trend reversal. This is a good system and I feel we can develop it further with a more consistent methodology.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I just saw a good scalp opportunity, my reasoning was that previous interest was high and price went up, it hit level 55. It then hovered below 55, showing no interest, so buy order for 55, a modest TP at 60, and SL at 50. Doesn't it look nice? http://postimage.org/image/nk2hgcaab But reality bites, as always http://postimage.org/image/pzjcp8tg7 The truth is, I feel like I'm missing entries. Or instead I should reverse the direction even though it is the opposite to the rules. Is someone else having better results?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
** News Flash ** I definitely will probably only do this once. But if you take VPLT and look at RIMM (Rim) stock......you may see some opportunity And that is all I will say.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I love freebies. ;-) How about a "one a week" news flash?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hello Spud, How was your trading with VPLT? would love to see more of your illustration when trading with price levels. Still need more of your guidance in how to read those interactions properly.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Spud Thank you for your one and only signal. I can see the 30m is showing big volume on a downbar. Looks like its confirming the Level at 15. But how de we know if it's bouncing or breaking that level? Please can you show us some more detailed examples? Highly appreciated! Thanks

--- 帖子 #385 ---
More will be posted soon.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
You are either scalping "to" 1.3555, good Decision. Not sure where I see the 60 or long from 55? You analysis is perfect, "It then hovered below 55, showing no interest". Now, interest is where price goes when volume increases as we are expecting that price will be attracted too a new or existing price level. That occurs when the volume increased and price went down. Right at this point I'd be far more interested on the short side. Next 2 candles in the new image give us the confirmation of the 55 price level. Right after that you again have volume up, price down....another short attraction. Looks like you get a another confirmation at 55 with very big short candle. Price is close to 50 now. From here not showing much interest but expect we'll get a confirmation of the 50 price level forming with volume. Definitely you had 2 indications of short . Don't overlook that price levels confirm or form at volume peaks so we always get a volume down after the peak. In this series of candles it is 55 that is the relavant price level until a new price level is formed. That is what you need to trade by and relate volume too.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Thanks for the quick reply! I'm beginning to see it from another angle. The long from 55 is marked with a bar-wide red horizontal line, line of 60 isn't showing because of chart zoom. I see my mistake now that there's nothing which suggests interest in above 55, but very subtle hints about shifting interest to 50. I'll concentrate more on the details now, there's a very fine line considering the example.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi Spud, what do you think about the relation with VLPT method and news trading? To what extent its effectiveness in this scenario? Or perhaps there is trading time that fits well for VPLT? I appreciate your answer. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
My trade for today. Only on demo lets see how this plays out.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I trade to my lifestyle (6-11 pm EST in general). Not a very exciting time, but I get to live a normal life. I do have endurance trade sessions when I have time and trade the entire market. Really makes no difference to me. News, I'm aware of it. I look at news as a "crap" shoot". I just go by the market, and if there is a good signal I trade it....if there is news, so be it. I'm know I hit more stops during news events, but not significant enough to bother me. It is buyer beware.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The mark of a professional, imo. When a trader steps away from the 'entrancement' of the market and just makes it part of the everyday he or she turns the corner towards professionalism. I wish I had seen this quote when I was younger. ;-)

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Marine, my chart shows a spike which hit 91 (above your SL), did the unfortunate happen in your platform also? BTW, how do you explain or rationalize the entry? From what I understand from the chart, you entered right after the volume spike. Where did you take it that the interest lies below?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
My scalping M1 style: Spike, confirming level 80; Low volume after spike, nothing to see here; Low volume, no action in price, don't know nothing yet; Bigger volume, nice movement up, too. Interest lies higher, putting buy order at 80; Down candle with higher volume but it is a spike confirming 80, so I still see it going higher; again, nothing-to-see-here candle, cause it's post-spike candle; Somewhat alarming stuff, order opened but high volume with down movement (something to do with reaching the price level?); Price takes off, in profit after candle close; Not confirmed spike, thinking of bailing; Bailing out to take the small pips (about 3 pips), better than losing aye; That's my take on this so far.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi Spud Is my interpretation of the volume price correct? Volume Peak is followed by higher prices but lower volume. Specialy the 3 downcandles on low volume is indicating a coming up move. Or can you explain in your words what you see? Thank you for your ongoing help. Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS. please ignore the trade that's a different system I trade

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thank you Spud for your comment. Please be kind for another question: I notice that everytime the price were not moving (you wrote "they are happy") AND the volumes were going up/down, then the price will follow the direction of volume. Also, everytime the volumes were flat (you wrote "not interest") AND the price going up/down, then price will follow its direction while the volumes were flat. Is it true? I am eagerly waiting your comment. Thanks again for your kindness!

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Spud Today's chart was a text book case for VPLT. Peak price levels were followed by low volume and 'determinator' candle in the opposite color to the peak volume candle. When this is not the case is it still a valid peak price level ? I have noticed that when peak price level is not confirmed with the opposite color candle it usually change direction soon there after. What does it signify ? Sorry if you have already explained it else where. Thanks. Jess

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Spud, you said, " trade VPLT on the now, not what you think will happen, not what has happened." I think it difficult for me to grasp this logic because you cant trade the current candle until it closes right? You dont know a volume is peak until the next one is closed lower. So to say long when volume is up, you dont know yet until it closes. By the time it closes, it already late and the next price might go and reverse.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I've been using the same trading style as yours, i thought i was the only one trading like that....Subscribing! Using this kind of trading, couple with some good S/R levels (corresponding to levels where Volume climaxed) is one hell of a technique. Best of luck

--- 帖子 #399 ---
http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6509/jan25d.gif Spud, please allow me to comment and question based on your chart. You said "So, we expect to see that if volume increases, price will fall. However, if volume rises and price continues to rise, then a new price level is attracting our price and we can expect to see price move to a new, higher price level." So we wait for the volume to go up. We do not know yet until the next candle/volume closes. Right? We can only anticipate the possibility that in the next candle, when volume is up, we expect price to go down. Please see my next post.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/277/jan25dd.gif Here as expected our anticipation is right. Volume up price down. The question is, do we enter short now? while the volume is still rising? I think not. we wait for the candle to close or maybe enter short as long as the volume take the high of the last bar. Lets say we entered short because the volume is up and price should go down but we dont know how far it will go until the candle close. See my next post.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/4104/jan25de.gif Ok so if we entered short, we should be stopped out. The volume is still going up and the price didnt go down as we think it should. It went the other way. Its fine, market moves that way, no 100% winner. So our next aticipation is going long. But where do we enter? Do we enter now while the volume is rising? or do we wait for the candle to close? We dont know yet if the price is up or down until it closes. Now let say it closes. Where do we enter now? We already missed the up move. An on the next candle we dont know yet if the volume is up or down. These kind of scenario confuses me. I think its just easy to analyze the chart history but I wonder if you can do the same in live chart where you dont see the future candle and future PL and future volume. Hope to hear your reply. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
How do you say long trade establised? You dont know yet until the candle close.We dont know the volume is up until its closed. By the time it close its already up. Buy should be at low. right?

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Kind of different method. Draw lines on opening/closing candles (depending on up/down move) corresponding with high vol. See what it does when it retest the high vol area (where buy/sell orders are pretty active).

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I'm referencing "to price levels". Flat volumes are locked to the current price level, although you will see price candles move up or down around a price level, the price is generally going to range at the price lvel. The breakaway move is when volume rises higher and price moves away from the price level....it is in a move to go to a new price level. You have to keep in mind though what the relevant (current) price level is. When you see a volume rise, you must always ask yurself, "If this is a volume peak, what will happen to price?". It will either confirm the current price level or make a new price level. Now, you need to look back a bit and see what volume/price have been doing.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Price candle direction after a peak volume bar/price candle (the Determinator candle) direction is not significant in determining price direction. The volume peak price candle and the Determinator candle are always linked to establishing/confirming a price level. The Determinator's volume is always lower than the volume peak. In the situtation where you have an up price candle at volume peak, followed by an up price candle (Determinator) right after the volume peak with down volume obviously, will likely put the price level up. So if volume rises and price rises up and away from the price level then it is a long situation. If price is up and volume is down, then price is likely staying near the price level and we have to wait for a volume up/price away move.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
It is best not to trade until a candle closes. However, there are volume/price situations that can be determined before the candle closes, and those are fine....so long as you are aware that major volume/price moves can happen in the last minute of a candle's life on a 15 min chart. "Now" means basing your decision on what you know now and not forecasting. For example, just because the market sets up for a long after a candle close, does not mean that the price is going to run and jump up 50 pips. What it means is that right now, the market is interested in the price going up. The close of the next candle may reverse (the market does change its mind all the time), and this is where you can read and recover your long entry. In many cases you can recover a trade entry with VPLT if you are watching the market, even grab a couple of pips. "Now" means you are aware that the market could and will change. That a long or short signal does not mean a 50 pip run in price direction. That the market is ever changing, and what VPLT is, is reading what the market is deciding to do "now" and trading based on this knowledge, not what your think might happen. You will quickly find my doing this and trading VPLT, that you actually start getting a small window into the future...15-30 mins, but you can make a lot of pips in 15-30 mins, or at least recover from bad entries. Trading in open candles is opportunistic. Situations arise where volume is flat and price drives away from a price level, that is an opportunity for a trade from the price "now" to the price level. Reading markets, volumes and prices - it really doesn't take too long to get a feel of how things move. It is the ability to stop, and trade only what you know and the "now" that is the hard part...because getting ahead of the market and thinking "yes I'm in a huge long run" is the trap.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Spud...Good to see you back. I was a follower of the your MTF / Escalator Thread. My live account trading these two methods did quite well. However I haven't traded live since your last post at MTF/Escalator Thread. I had a few questions that remained unanswered ....so decided to bail. I stumbled across VPLT (wanna get back in) and it looks just as promising as the MTF/Escalator Thread, I look forward to read each Post. Welcome back !!

--- 帖子 #408 ---
After the volume peak you indicated (including the volume/price after the peak), there is a volume bar rise and price rise away from the price level of our volume peak. This is the long entry. Price has moved up and away and volume is increasing, so price is looking for a new price level. The next candle establishes the last volume/price as another volume peak and hence you get another new, higher price level (1.3165 it looks like) Next 3 price candles are down, and moving away from 1.3165, volume is down, so there is not going to be a price move down. Our long entry is still holding, we should have not hit any stops. If yiu haven't gone long by now, you would to trade "up to" 1.3165 and hopefully a new price level beyond...if we get that VPLT signal. The next volume/price jump up, and somewhere before this you should have been long and benefited. Either exit and grab your pips, or expect that volume will continue to rise and price rise, or that a new price level will be formed and then determine what to do next. Stop of course is moved way up. We get a new price level at 1.3180 and the last volume/price candle just supports this new price level, no signal yet for long or short.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thanks JayJay. You'll find VPLT much more consistent and I think more fun to play (actively trade). It is a bit of a bear to explain, and probably read/learn...but we'll get there.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
First, don't worry if you miss a price jump, there are plenty more to follow and that you will be in before they happen. Don't be impatient that you might "miss" something. There is no missing, just entering when you have a clear idea of where the market is headed. What we ended up with here was another higher price level, we get another volume peak right after the red arrow. The first long entry would have been at the price candle right after the red arrow. If you missed or ignored that, than on the last volume/price candle ask yourself "Is this going to be a volume peak?" If it isn't, then long entry as then we expect volume to rise and price to rise in search of a new price level. If it is, then next price candle could be up or down with lower volume. So your option is to wait it out and let a new price level establish and then wait for a trade signal (conservative choice). The other option is to enter long at/near the current price level (in the open candle). Anticipating a new higher price level or a higher volume/higher price. You want to enter long as low as possible, just in case the market does reverse. But the "now" decision is long.

There was a text book of VPLT this morning. I just grab 20 pips after following the direction. Great! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #413 ---
After there were several volume peak with price down (indicated with red line down), I wait until 08.30 GMT when the price was down to 1.3626 with volume up. So, I decided to short and get 20 pips at one hour later.

Just want to share another scalp, which went the wrong way. Spike, defining level 35; No info there as post-spike candle; Bar seems to try to break above 35, but no interest, I started to look for a short, TP in the region of 30; After this bar finished, I took it as interest at 30 because of little downward movement and bigger volume, opened a short at 34; It went into a very little profit, but volume dried up, I stayed in the trade, hoping for a fall. Now I realise bar nr 4 was actually a spike, still confirming the level of 35; Pretty much self-explanatory and from here on price climbed until my SL of 5 pips. So, a fault of my own, not paying enough attention to details, I should have bailed out at bar 6 with a small loss. On the other hand, if I'd let it run, I would have made my trade as price topped at 40 and went down.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
If you are having trouble "seeing" the market with VPLT alone, you can use other indicators to help you. In doing so, you need to remind yourself that these added tools help support your VPLT decision. Now, there are all sorts of tools to use like Stochastics, MACD, Parabolic SAR, just to name a few. I'll help this along by showing you how to use MACD with VPLT. I'll be honest, I'm very reluctant to show this because it may take away to much from pure VPLT. However, I am also reading the challenges in seeing the market with VPLT alone. So, overall this may help. Let's start with a chart and start with a short market entry away from a price level.. Look at the chart and I think it is pretty clear what the market is doing relative to the price level with the MACD picture added. Take a good look and see what you derive from the price level, how volume is moving in reaction to price moves relative to the price level and the picture MACD draws.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
VPLT establishes what is known as the "major price level" when 2 things are known: 1. That we have a traditional VPLT volume spike 2. MACD histogram bar cross the "0" MACD level. Our volume peak can happen before the MACD crossover, but the MACD crossover must take place. Note: We also should be in a fairly good frame of mind that VPLT is telling us the price direction. This will eliminate many false signals from MACD, if you stick to VPLT and don't get lazy with MACD and blindly use every crossover. Remember, MACD is painting us a picture of the market....don't let it control you. Since MACD histogram bars are down below the "0" level of the MACD, we are trading down and away from the "major price level", or up and to the "major price level. We will NEVER enter a long trade up and away from the "major price level" with the MACD histogram bars below "0". If you only make one trade here on this chart, than it is a short entry when price is at or as close too the "major price level" as possible. For now we will focus solely on this one short trade entry. There are numerous other trade opportunities, that we will address much later. Our "major price level" become irrelevant in several circumstances, but the most obvious is when our VPLT and MACD reset and create a new "major price level" (i.e. when MACD crosses over and VPLT is moving away from our old major price level). -- see vertical green line on right of chart. Run VPLT through and you can come up with probably a similar picture. MACD makes it quick and easy....but MACD just paints the picture. That's the basics, and yes we can use this MACD tool to get some pretty good trade signals. And that comes next.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thank You Spud. It's a good entry confirmation signal. But don' t worry. I'm sure those of us who have followed this thread are hooked on to VPLT. It's such an elegant method and will continue to use it as it is meant to.

Hi, here´s a demo trade from earlier today. Please comment. http://i50.tinypic.com/116jlzm.gif 1,2 and 3 establish PL@1.3540 3-4 establish a new PL@ 1.3525 4,5,6 price up volume down so there´s clearly no interest in higher pricelevels. Good entry @candle 7 pricelevel 1.3540, TP@ 1.3525, SL@ 1.3550 R:R&gt;1:1. 8,9 gives a new PL@1.3520 10,11 confirmning less interest in higher PL so bias is short. 12,13 possibly showing that the lowest PL to concider is @1.3520. 14 price up and volume down gives an indication to short @candle 15 PL 1.3540, TP@PL1.3525, SL@1.3550. R:R&gt;1:1. Worked out good. Regards Waez

Great VPLT analysis! And excellent pip taking management!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
The chart below is a "short" MACD example, where the MACD histogram is below the MACD "0" level. The chart below shows 3 vertical red lines numbered 1, 2 and 3. These lines are established like normal VPLT, where volume has peaked -- except we are only interested in a short signal since our MACD histogram has crossed down across the MACD "0" level. As such, we can see these short signals when we have a volume peak, and the MACD histogram is growing larger in our trade direction. As you know from MACD, the MACD histogram is showing greater divergence as it moves away from "0", which generally means strength in the price move...and we know about VPLT and market already, so that is why these are obvious short signals. The short trade entry is best made at or near the major price level (1.3055 in the chart). This is the "safe" point, go too high above to enter short and you may caught in a price reversal, go too low and you may have missed the short...close means 2-3 pips from major price level....unless something else is telling you it is ok to exceed this. You will notice that the 3 VPLT price candles, all support the major price level at 1.3055, and that we have short signals repeated 3 times. You won't always get that, but here rather obvious what to do. You will also note our short entries all had opportunity to enter above the major price level when signaled....again that won't always happen. That's a typical short signal. You will see this pattern over and over on short signals in the market. You may not get 3 short signals in a row like on this chart, but 1 is enough. You know about VPLT. MACD is only supporting our VPLT, in that it supports the downward price move. The combination can give us an early view to what is happening, but certainly in the "here and now" the market picture is pretty clear...you only have one trade direction to go based on that. Don't forget that VPLT works on the basis that the market does blatantly obvious things and basis their decisions on either price action or indicators -- so it should be no surprise that we can start to see the blatantly obvious market decisions if we tap into it. Volume of course is our guide to where they put their money and price levels are where they are headed.

Following up post 427. Please comment. http://i48.tinypic.com/35n7ifo.gif At 9 the trade went +8 pips and I moved the SL to BE+1 which was hit sortly after. In hindsight it´s clear that the trade was never in danger. The peak at 9 merely confirmed the PL@1.3565 and afterwards the price dived. Regards Waez

Always move stop loss to protect pips. And now I rant....Better to take pips than lose pips 100% of the time. There is no such thing as "missing" pips. Where the most money is lost is chasing "missing" pips and ending up losing pips...let the ego go when trading....millions of opportunities to trade and make pips. How can you lose when you win? and win? and win?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
So what are the decisions at 9? 1. Volume down, this would likely create a confirmatin of the current price level....so stick with your trade. 2. Volume up, you could favour a long here and take your pip...there is nothing wrong with that...positive pips is always a good trade. This would be because we see what looks like a weakening at the price level and that #9 looks like it will drive to a new higher price level. However, you could also look at 6, 7 and 8 prices all weakening (i.e. they aren't going with higher highs) and support the low take. VPLT is established to protect a decision, which is why it pays off. A short decison here, you see the pip machine. There's an argument for short. Taking the long position, is also supported and it is why you don't get caught. In the end, long is wrong here, but that will happen....take a pip from the wrong way versus a 20-30 pip loss...that's what will win the day. However, after #10, you go short...right? Same reasons you went long....but now you see the other direction. Be very careful not to lock yourself into a decision and expect the market to follow. Look for changes and take them. We are still hovering around the price level, so there isn't really a nice clear take away of price, until #11, #10 confirms our price level and 7,8,9,10 shout short.

My trade: Short in at #10 with a S/L of 15 and a TP at 20. There's no change in price level at #11 and though volume looks a little flat with #10,11 the price in #11 is breaking away short, so I'm still short and my S/L is moved down 5 (10) my TP is increased to 25. That's a 10:25 loss/profit ratio....I like these. My short pays off in #12, and I grab 25 pips because my TP was hit. If I had a chance, I'd move my S/L to 0. Wait for the new price level to form. Repeat.

Thanks for the below chart and the explanations Spud. My entry today was at 13470 and exited at 13435. Had it not been for the ECB press conference I would have taken my entry at 13560. You are right in noting that market makes blatantly obvious moves. I can appreciate that more since I started using VPLT and growing in confidence with your insights. Best regards

--- 帖子 #440 ---
For sure, in the heat of the moment I need to remember that the next trade is around the corner. It feels better to lock in profit however small or reduce the SL and occaisonally miss a bigger win because the SL is being hit. Thanks Spudfyre for the answer. Regards Waez

It feels like I´m learning to walk - taking the first step is fairly comfortable, but then keep on walking and holding the balance is trickier. More practice is def needed. Great Spudfyre, I`m grateful for your teaching. Cheers Waez

AJ trade. PL@96.150 established with candles 1 and 2. Then 3, 4. 5, falling with falling volume creates a clear opportunity to go long at candle 6. Entry @95.926, SL@95.800 and TP@96.099(96.100). RR&gt;1:1 +18 pips. http://i45.tinypic.com/o8rpxx.gif Regards Waez

AU running trade. This is great fun. Thank you Spudfyre. I´m looking forward to your next post http://i47.tinypic.com/2j2t4cl.gif Relevant PL created by 1,2,3,4 and 5. Short bias showned by 5,6,and 7. New peak at 8 falling so entry @1.02764, Sl@1.02850, TP@1.0265 RR&gt;1:1 Stoploss moved to BE+1. Regards Waez

Nice trades! Can you elaborate on your entries? The second trade - why sell if previous bar is a down candle with low volume? Hoping to hear your views on it as it will help to understand things better! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Following up post 445: http://i47.tinypic.com/2z9b537.gif http://i49.tinypic.com/35lzwcy.gif Candle 9 entry stopped out @BE+3 at candle 11. Candles 9,10,11 and 12 condirmed short bias, 13 and 14 rising with falling volume so I entered again at 15. The trade went quickly in profit so SL@ BE. But look at the peaks at 5,8,10,12 and 15. They just kept the price PL1.02700 never going past 1.0265. Already at candle 12 that observation made me a bit suspicious that price may brake long instead of short. Spudfyre please comment on this. Well anyway, it was two fairly safe entries. Regards Waez

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi Spud, please be kind to comment on my trading (which was loss): PL was created at 1.3390 and was confirmed by 1,2 and 3. I think it was a short tendency at 4 (price down at 1,2,3 and volume down; followed by price still down at 4 and volume up). Entry with short position at red arrow: SL and TP 20 pips from entry price. In which part should I improve my attention. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
1,2 and 3 are all weak attraction of price to 1.3390. You are right, 4 could be interpreted as downward move, but I'd like to see if 4 generates a new lower price level (with volume peak) or if it reconfirms 1.3390. My entry after 4 would be short at 1.3388 to 1.3392...somewhere around the price level...that would protect my short entry. Why? If 4 turns into a volume peak and price is up/volume downat 5 then we are where we should be in the short at the same confirmed price level. If volume had been higher at 5 than 4, and price hit 1.3390 we'd have to question a short entry or at least give us some added entry protection. If volume was lower at 5 than 4, and price hits 1.3390, than we have a much stronger short entry. The market at 5 generated a new price level...at 1.3380 from the volume peak at 4. 6,7,8 are weak attractions to 1.3380. You could make a case that this would signal more down price support and that a volume rise will likely lead to a price down move......but we haven't seen that yet. Short at 1.3380? Let's step back and look at 4,5,6,7,8...so price is falling and so is volume....and 7,8 price turns up...it all really puts a big question mark on short...I'd bail out of any short by 8 for sure and take pips or salvage my short position. This same cycle plays out again a little later, both cycles should nab you some positive short pips. and then where the price peaks low and we get a volume peak....new price level at 1.3365...the long entry trade shows itself and you should get caught in the long price move near the end of the chart (initially aiming to ride up to 1.3390). It would be easy to create a bias here for shorts from 1.3390 and that is the thing, not to develop short/long bias. Run with the market turns, or wait for the stronger signals (the long at the end of the chart from 1.3365) is a much better signal.

Hi, spud take a look at this trade i took today. i may have got in a little early however it worked ok. hope you can understand the chart.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thank you very much Spud. Have a more understanding after read and learn your comments. Highly appreciated!

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hmmmm....a little risky me thinks for a long entry where you put it. If we assume that the volume peak is going to occur, than we'd establish a new price level at 1.3420, but we don't yet have any long indication. Power at this time is still on the down side..or at 1.3420. The clear indicator for long entry is after the 20 pip tp candle closes. Still will give you 20 pips, or close too. You could also launch long at 1.3420, as the down move is obvioulsy dead...but on the 2nd candle after your entry.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
ok spud i need to get better on my entrys. this isn`t easy.i will keep working at it. thank you for your help. and any thing you can do to help

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Taking this literally in this sequence below: Going with the volume peaks after candles closing and I will assume a 2 pip cushion above/below when entering: 1. Down peak establishing PL 1.3385. Entry 2 pips below 1 not triggered 2. Peak but Doji new PL 1.3380. Hard to tell the direction. 3 and 4 price up volume down confirming PL 1.3380- short bias. 5. Price down volume up so nice entry 2 pips below @ 1.3386 - WINNING TRADE when following peaking 6 (low 1.3368) and 7 down . 8. Price up - volume down. Confirming PL 1.3380-85 with short bias. 6,7 and 8 hints that price would not go much lower than PL 1.3380. 9. Price up - volume up and a new PL @ 1.3400. Long bias and a sell stop placed 2 pips above, not triggered. 10. Price down - volume down long bias creates an excellent enter @ PL 1.3380 - WINNING TRADE following 11 up. 12. Price up - volume up. Buy stop 2 pips above. 13. The trade is triggered and goes approx 20 pips - WINNING TRADE. New PL @ 1.3440. Buy stop 2 pips above not triggered. 14 and 15 price down and volume down long bias. 16. Price down - volume up short bias and a sell stop 2 pips below @ 1.3430. 17. Trade is triggered and goes down to 1.34266 before turning against. Would you have had the time to move your SL to protect the trade? For me this one would have meant a loss so - LOOSING TRADE. Price up - volume up long bias confirming PL. 1.3340. A new buy stop placed 2 pips above, not triggered. 18. Price down - volume up, short bias and a sell stop placed 2 pips below, not triggered. 19. Price down - volume up, short bias and a sell stop placed 2 pips below, not triggered. 20. Price down - volume down, I wasn´t thinking here, placed a sell order wrongly and to late making a loss. Placing the sell stop 2 pips below 19 would have kept me out of this trade. 21. Price up - volume up so a buy stop 2 pips above. 22. The trade is triggered @1.3449 and the price reaches 1.3474 so another WINNING TRADE. The peak at candle 27 would have produced another WINNING or at least BE TRADE. Now I don´t know if my backtesting here is done according to Spudfyres recommendations and maybe this sequence of 5 winning and 1 loosing trade on the M30 TF was an extaordinary beneficial one - or maybe not, but it´s nice to see.

Hi I've take a loss on the following chart. I have two defined levels at 3430 and 3445. I took a long at the close of the arrow bar. SL was palced at a 1:1 RR Any comments please? should I have taken the trade off after the two low volume up bars? But the third up pin bar at higher volume gave me confidence and I kept the trade.

Excellent VPLT on EU this morning. Entry 2 pips above candle 1 @ 1.3396, SL@1.3385, TP@1.4100 R:R&gt;1:1. Trade triggered during candle 2 and quickly went to +7 and then I moved SL to BE+1. When the trade was +10 I moved SL to BE+5 which got hit. As you can see price then hit original TP@1.34100. At candle 5 price goes down - volume up. I was not around at the time but would have entered 2 pips below 5 and then another winning trade with huge potential. Spudfyre from your experience - did I move my SL to quick you think? Maybe it´s enough to go BE+1 when the trade is in profit 6-8 pips and then let i have its run instead? Please advice. Cheers Waez http://i50.tinypic.com/25sant5.gif

Very interesting thread Subscribed! I'll try and read from the start through the week-end. Thank you for your teaching and effort Spudfyre (and all others participants).

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi, This is an interesting thread. I like the idea of just looking at volume (no indicators needed) for trading

--- 帖子 #463 ---
You can't lose being in postive pips. Don't think about what you "missed", think about what you got. You've got a thousand more opportunities to make 5 pips vs 30 pips. I know, seems ridiculous at $1 a pip or less to take 5 pips....but at $10 a pip or more....it's serious money making when you do that 5-10 times a day. Put the time in and perfect the $1 pip. Move that S/L. Take those 5 pips. There will be plenty of trades that S/L won't get hit and you'll ride a big candle. Great! But don't hunt them, just take your pips, learn to take your pips...that's so hard...but when you can take positive pips "all" the time, you will be a money machine. It adds up quick. Walmart makes money "5 cents" a sale....think about it. VPLT is an excellent way to trade into positive pips...the secret is not to forecast and set yourself to take the positive pips when they show themselves. This will keep your losing trades to a min and you will find "pots of pips' every now and then for the big bonus. Just move the S/L. VPLT gives you constant trade opportunities and most will find positive pips, even when the market goes against you....so use that. Take the pips. You miss nothing if you close a trade with positive pips...you make money.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Volume bars are relative to each other (i.e. the volume number doesn't matter). Having said that you will get "noise" at lower volume levels, where the market may just range. Sometime you have to look at volume only above this "noise". -- that's not a rule though...volume and price movement is not relative...i.e. price can still move a lot on little volume or vice versa. I don't see the long trade here. You have a price level indicated at 1.3445 from a volume peak...correct. 3 candles later there is another price level at 1.3440 with a volume peak. Now after this there is a long signal, but it gets slammed with a good sized down candle and up volume....so interest is till down and away from the 1.3445 and 1.3440 levels, this is a short signal...here we go short. Where you entered long, a good assumption would be a new price level around 1.3435. Nothing wrong at 1.3430, but I would have put it at 1.3435 when it showed as a volume peak. Next...volume down, price up. (still short) Then, volume up, price down (still short) bang...big volume up, price down (still short) exit on next candle or move S/L to max pips and stay short. Run the options of a volume peak and new price level forming on continual rising volume bars....it usually leads you to the right path.

Well, glad I followed suit today protecting the bank. One nice win and 2 BE as shown on the chart attached. I really enjoy this kind of method and as you say plenty of opportunities will show up every day. Really nice of you to share and teach this way of looking at the market. As you´ve been pointing out, not anticipating the market but instead looking at what price is doing in relation to relevant PL is the first nut to crack. And then there are good or not so good places to enter. I don´t know if there´s something to it and remember I know virtually nothing about trading but I`m vary of entering on candles with long shadows and small bodies, so my second entry on 2 I shouldn´t have taken and I also bailed out quickly with -2. The first trade was obviously ok, the second I should have left alone. The third I think was correct and luckily I moved SL to BE when the trade was 5-7 pips in profit. Spudfyre, when following the flow, that is entering after a volume peak and market is seeking a new PL I use a 2 pip+spread safety distance. When price is drifting away with lower volume from the current PL as at the situation after 4 it´s ok to enter directly at the start of the new candle as in 5. Especially when the price is at such a confirmed PL as 1.3350. What do you thimk of this and Please give your take on good and bad entry situations. Many Thanks Waez http://i45.tinypic.com/ajw36t.gif

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Waez, thanks for posting your last screenshot. I compared it to my actual setup and i see some differences. I see we have the lower 3 PL in common at 1.3310, 1.3330 and 1.3335 But i cant follow you with the upper two PL. You set one at 1.3350 and the other at 1.3370. I set mine at 1.3360 because i see only one PL there. Can u elaborate how you decided to set these two PL please ? Thanks, tex

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Tex, I put the PL@1.3350 mainly because it was the highest PL candle 4 closed at and that price bounced around that level after candle 4, see box D. The PL@1.3370 came in to play with candles 5 and 6 in box E. But looking back at the chart thanks to your questions some interesting things show up. Looking at box A and D it´s clear that an important area of interest for buyers is at PL1.3350-55. It´s a trigger level for candle 1 which shoots up from PL1.3355 and then several hours later candle 5 which goes off from the same level/area. Box B gives PL1.3380 and box C PL1.3375 and these PL:s obviously creates an area of interest for sellers. Hours later at box E candle 5 exactly touches PL1.3375 with a volume peak that took the energy out of the market. Price then falls and hoovers around PLarea 1.3350-55. A very interesting question is to analyse the ranging periods. My take on it is that Box D leans at a long bias in relation to what happened in Box A. But maybe I´m taking to much from irrelevant history in doing this and I hope Spudfyre will comment on this. When the price was ranging in the area 1.3330-35 in the lower middle part of the chart it was difficult to form an opinion of the direction of the breakout. I find it not at all easy but at the same time it´s absolutely intriguing trying to understand what´s happening on the charts. Cheers Waez http://i48.tinypic.com/2qa70y1.gif

VPLT Transition Trading Now that you see how price and volume work together, we can get a little more complicated and feast a little more on pips. Transition Trading with VPLT is identifying the start and end of long cyles. You have probably noticed with VPLT that there are many times when volume peaks are also at price peaks and wouldn't it be nice to know we are at the top or bottom of a price cycle. Keep in mind exactly what a volume peak is. Simply, a volume peak is the price that the market is most interested in at that point in time. Now, we know that as we track price levels, they are dynamic and new price levels are set all the time. We also know that there is an upper and lower limit, but how do we trade this? Well let's find out. First we have to know what a price cycle is. I'll stick to the M15 price chart. Here are the rules of a "short" price cycle: 1. The short price cycle always starts after the close of a long price candle...NEVER during. 2. The short price cycle always ends after the close of a short price candle...NEVER during. 3. The long and short price candles should be significant in length, the more length they have, the more significant they are. Length is measured as the difference between the open and close price. In other words, we are looking for price candles that have some distance between the open and close price. Now, this is as subjective as it is significant. There will be other indications involved to identify our price cycle, but a pure natural short price cycle will have a lengthy long candle to start it, and a lengthy short candle to close it. This is a typical picture of a price cycle (number of candles will vary):

--- 帖子 #469 ---
The price cycle like so many things in Forex is easy to see after it is all done, but how do we identify them before they happen? Well, this is actually fairly simple and systematic. Let's look at a short entry. First we need some indicators: Volume (of course) On Balance Volume (new) MacD The On Balance Volume indicator needs to be added to/with the regular volume indicator. On the picture below it is the blue squiggly line on my volume indicator. All are just regular default settings. What!?! OBV? OBV is a measure of buying and selling pressure and for us it is exactly that, a pressure meter so we know when volume at a price level is creating pressure. In the chart below I've labeled three things as 1,2 and 3. These are not in any specific order, just what we are looking for to identify the start of a short price cycle. 1. Our MACD bar has risen above the MACD signal line. Now, also notice that the MACD bars previous are rising up to cycle start, but that they are all below the signal line. Ideally, this is what we want the MACD to look like for a short entry....you may have the bar just below the signal line (as the previous bar) with the other signals "ok"...so risks of early entries are possible. How loose you are to the bar crossing the signal line in your decision process is up to you. Likewise, waiting a bar later is "late" but safer with confirmed signals...sometimes though you will be too late. 2. Our volume is rising (price is rising), we should be anticipating that we are probably at a volume peak and what would we do under VPLT conditions. The OBV blue line is indicating peak pressure on the volume at this price level. SO, we want OBV to be high, very high...at least 75% or higher on our volume scale. Bonus if volume bar crosses above the OBV line, but close is good. If you waited late on this one, you would have the added knowledge that this was a volume peak. You won't always have a volume peak coincide with this signal....volume peaks are typically close by though. Rising volume bars prior to our signal is important. 3. Doesn't look like a very lengthy price candle, but it is lengthy enough. The price candle prior to this may make an easier entry to identify, but it would be early. Not so early to stop out and still give us a good entry, but ideally, the close of candle at "3" is our short entry price. We enter on the open of next candle for short trade. This is what we want to see for a short entry. This is by far the best and most common short entry signal. Thing of all these signals as a pressure meter for price, where price is at the highest point (for now) and this pressure will have to be relieved with a price drop.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Now of course the start of a short entry is the close of a long price cycle, and likewise, the close of a short price cycle is the start of a long price cycle....well at least in a perfect world. Let's look at the close of our short trade entry (short price cycle). Again fairly systematic and routine, where there the volume pressure is gone and price needs to fill the pressure up again. And who thought Forex wasn't a money machine? Looking at chart below: 1. Slightly different signal in that the MACD bar has crossed the "0" line and is now below...also that the previous MACD bars descending. You could have had the signal line below our MACD bar..with the MACD bar crossing down through the signal line as the other signal. But it will always be significant when a MACD bar crosses "0". 2. OBV line is way low, we want it way low. Notice the volume bar how's it has climbed. Think about that, we 'd expect from our VPLT knowledge this would end up being (or part of) a volume peak. Also notice the previous volume bars descending (collectively). Volume doesn't have to be spiking here, it could be much lower than our previous volume bars. More important that we have this low OBV value. 3. Exit the short on close. Oh, and a good time to start a long entry....or is it? We don't live in a perfect world....so better to find what good long entries look like.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Now you might be saying, "omg we've added even more indicators to what was once a non-indicator system". You don't need the indicators, but they just make our lives a whole lot easier and visual. You could truly trade this on just VPLT but that is like doing math without a calculator. You'll find in the long run if you trade this enough that your dependency on the indicators will fade away. But, I'm helping you cheat and save a couple of years of trading practice. This is far "more" an odds play, so you may see stops hit a tad more. Sometimes price doesn't always move as fast as we like, but we just keep going and we'll get our loss back and more. Don't think that price cycles always mean 100 or 500 pips...sometime they can be just 5 or 10 pips in life. Trade the cycle as it is presented to you. Price cycles can have ocscillations within them, and that may stop you out...oh well, you will have moved your S/L and grabbed the positive pips..right? You should find that this combination of VPLT and indicators will help your VPLT price direction decisions as well. It will also keep you out of some yucky range trades if you don't like scalping with VPLT. I'll show a long entry and then some variations to entry signals in upcoming posts.

Hi, please take a look at the attached pictures of EUM30 and M15. They are covering the same time but giving quite different messages. I think the M30 shows a clear buy bias, and the M15 is harder to read but to me it hints at a sell bias. Which one would you have followed. I turns out that the M30 was giving the correct info. I had a pending buy order at 1.34100 which didn´t got triggered. Plesase comment on have you would have done or maybe did in this sitaution.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi, thank you Spud for sharing this knowledge! I've been following you since Escalator to pips. Regarding Waez question, I guess both TF indications might be correct, but you cannot mix interests from different TF, they seem to be very confined to the TF you're analizing. I've noticed that PL in M5 are slightly different from M15, and if I want to use a shorter TF I have to move fast and do all the analysis again for that period, usually my SL are hit more often and the profit is less. What works for me is to stick to M15 and use a trailing stop of say 5 pips to protect my profit from sways. Jumping from M5 to M15 doesn't seem to work very well, I tend to lose "the big picture", and M30 is simply too slow, my SL has to be too far away for my (demo) account. I must confess that from time to time, if I'm in doubt I take a peek at MTF Stoch just to confirm the direction.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi, a some more charts over M5, M15 and M30 over the same timeperiod. Different PL:s show dependign on what TF you look at. Spudfyre please give a hint on how to use different TF:s to place trades.

After going through the whole thread I must say that this is one of the most (if not THE most) interesting and useful I ever read on FF. Yesterday night I tried some manual back-testing and was a bit discouraged since I felt that despite being able to establish the price levels I could not really read the price /volume interaction; nonetheless this morning I decided to try and trade (with ridiculously small amounts of course) The results are shown on the attached chart (down arrows). I first entered short while the candle was still developing (ignoring Spudfyre's instructions - won't do it again) @1.3460 and got stopped out for a 15 pips loss. I entered again at the end of the candle where I was stopped and took a 15 pips profit that could have been much more ( I had to leave the PC therefore I set the TP to 15 pips) Hopefully with the help of Spudfyre and all other participants things will improve. Please comment on the chart. Regards to all

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi Tom, in my view, the first arrow was not a good indicator to short. Previous 3 candle prices was up, volume up, a bias to long entry. But the second entry was good because there was a price down from determinator candle to the next candle with volume up, a bias to short entry. I hope we can get another opinion, especially from Spud.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi Spud Can you please give us an example of Transition Trading? I am a little confused now. When we find a price cycle and price retraces from a top, volume will decrease while price moves lower. That shows no interest in lower prices. But when looking at it from the Price cycle point of view we should keep the trade although it show less interest in lower prices. Thanks for your help

A Word About Mutiple Time Frames and VPLT The VPLT description in this thread refers to a single time frame. For sake of less confusion, I'm not going to refer to multiple time frames (MTF), except for this one time in this thread. Though MTF can be used, the strategy has to accomodate that the lower time frames create the longer time frames. VPLT is a here and now trading - trade what we know. Within building a M30 or H1 trend, for example, there will be oscillations and these oscillations will kill an M15 VPLT trade if refering to a M30 or H1 trend forecast. Now, those who know me from MTF Stochastics know I love MTF. MTF VPLT is a total different kettle of fish for the very reason you must take into account the shorter term oscillations that build a longer term time frame. Like MTF Stochastics the better trades occur when the MTF's line up and the smaller time frames feed/lead the larger time frames. The rest of course is all details. In terms of looking at M30 VPLT not agreeing to M15 VPLT, that could be misleading. I'd rather look at M15 VPLT leading M30 and M30 following the M15 moves. So, for simplicity sake, you would see growing price levels in an M15 long followed by M30 price levels growing in a long direction to confirm a long trend. Keep in mind that is a pretty simple approach, you would need to accomodate the M15 (and or M5) oscillations with larger stops, looking at M30 (or H1) to follow the long moves. The question is, is MTF worth the added time and trouble? Well, if you like trading long trends, than MTF is definitely a good direction to go in. However, if you are looking for action to stay awake at night and build a portfolio from micro pips to $1 a pip to $2 a pip and so on....then I'd stick to M15 VPLT.

Don't you love the devil in the details? The real stand out indication is between the 2 entry arrows, it is that volume down/price up candle. I'd argue a bit that the volme peak is actually on volume bar to the right of the first arrow. Just looking at your chart, to me that volume bar seems higher? Then the price level is actually 5 pips higher and the pull away down is far easier to see at the second arrow. However, you can still work off the info that you have presented to determine the same thing. Where you get the short bias is where the volume peak falls/price rises away from our price level...so market interest is less on the long. One price candle over where the second arrow is, still a short bias as volume increases/price falls down below the price level to close. The next price candle is another confirmation of the price level and still keeps the short bias. So basically from the climb to the first arrow, there has been a short bias all along. Ask yourself then, on the candle after the second arrow where price is up and volume down...what happens if volume goes up? We'd have to assume price will fall. Volume down? I'd look for a close in price slighty higher than our price level or last candle. Overall, risk/rewards on the short are pretty good. Start a 10 SL and 15 TP here as an entry. Keep the TP open and follow down with the SL as the trade develops.

Hi Spud, I've been reading and practicing your method a bit. Thanks for the information. It was confusing to me at first as a few others mentioned it was for them, but as I kept reading your posts and examples, I thinks some light managed to creep its way into my dark head. Anyway I've just been trying to stick to the basics of your logic. Establish good price levels using your volume technique and then begin some rational interpretation based on the interplay of price/volume with these levels. I had two good trades so far for +27 pips. And it really took me only an hour or so for both together. I'll post my second trade which turned out to be a scalp for 7 pips. This is on the EU, just a bit earlier. My reasoning for entry was that volume kept spiking every time it hit 3185 moving down. I already had this level picked out based on earlier price action/volume movement. So on the 1st and 2nd candles after the last vertical dotted line, you see a bullish two bar where volume spikes as price moves down, then spikes a bit higher as it moves away from the level. So, initial volume reaction at the level, followed by a higher level of interest in the bullish candle. Then on the next candle there is a little bear as price tries to move back down toward 3185, and volume drops. So I think ok there is a lot of interest in this level, and the interest seems to be moving up and away from it rather than down through it. Then there is another bull candle shortly after with another increase in volume. This is where I make my long entry at 3192. Looking at the charts initially, I think I'm good to 3225. Then there is a big bar up to 3205 on smaller volume. I'm thinking 3205 hmm, it ends in 5. So of course I look back at the recent price/volume history and noticed that I just basically missed the level, so as price fell away from it a bit, I took the 7 pips. I figured there was more to gain in taking the small profit and collecting more information about how price/volume was moving between the levels of my adjusted chart. Also this is just Asia and the night is still young. That was pretty much it. Sorry it took so long to explain a 7 point scalp.. But I hope I have some of the logic down correctly. I like this system since it at least attempts to get at the content of the picture rather than just the form of it.. Thanks again. -Steve

I was reading Spud's post #420 where he introduced MACD for the first time, and checking the charts for the last few days I noticed this drop from 1.3405 to 1.3225.... I think, if used properly MACD can be of great help to VPLT. What do you think guys and girls?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Sounds like you have VPLT spot on.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I managed to get into a 10 pips trade today shown on the chart which took place on the 6th candle; this was my interpretation on price/volume: Candles 1 and 2 set the price level @ 1.3230 and this was confirmed by the lack of interest in price leaving that level since both candle 3 and 4 showed decreasing volumes. Candle 5 stared to move price down and volume was low; volume increased as price retraced showing exhaustion of the down movement confirming interest in 1.3230 and up moves. I set my limit order at 1.3230 at the beginning of candle 6, price retraced a little, just enough to hit my order and moved up quickly. I moved my S/L @ 1.3240 an was taken out for a 10 pips gain.

Is that a "mini price cycle" ? How about the information from OBV?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Why are you trading on M5?

--- 帖子 #498 ---
@Kawangkoan and dkoleary- I was puzzled over the pricemovement and went down to M5 to try to figure out what went on "behind the scene", and when money from buyers and sellers came in to play in order to be persuade to take a trade in the one or another direction. OBV I did´nt check, it maybe could give a clue. I know Spudfyre advocates M15 so I won´t be posting charts from other TF again. Sorry Regards Waez

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Slowly getting there, winning trade +15pips Candles 1 and 2 show clearly no interest in higher PL:s. 3 gets pushed down with higher volume so I placed a sell limit @1.3120 which got triggered during 4. SL@1.3130, and TP@1.31052. http://i50.tinypic.com/acbhh1.gif Regards Waez

Price cycle vs MACD Hi Spud and all participants, I would like to know your comment on how to make decision when we meet a price cycle criteria which have different direction with MACD. Please take a look on my attachment. Eagerly waiting your advice. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Nice start of the day, Candle 1 started up but got pushed down on high volume so I put a sell limit @1.3090, SL@1.3105, TP@1.30702. http://i45.tinypic.com/2nthfup.gif Cheers Waez

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Two trades i took today. 2 Mins ago... Both shows the same criteria. Weak volume for upgoing price, lower interest in current price level. Both trades short.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
There´s always the question on moving the SL and when to enter, at the close of the last candle or at a PL slightly above/below. Here I missed out a perfect setup. At close of candle 2 I placed a sell limit @ PL1.3045. It got triggered on 3 and ones in profit 5-6 pip I moved the SL to BE+1 and got stopped out. Since the setup still looked very good I decided to reenter with a sell limit again @1.3045 although to late, a nice down move followed. http://i45.tinypic.com/15z2lwj.gif Cheers Waez

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Ones identifying a good setup it´s probably better to set and forget I think. I´m more successfull doing so. From the last 9 trades 8 have been winners between 1 and 20 pips and 1 loser for 15 pips. I´m enjoying it, thanks SPudfyre. Cheers Waez

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Waez, I think Spud recommendation is to enter at the close of last candle. Should we would like to enter early, we should move to the shorter time frame (M5) to find supporting setting. Btw, I read your posting, great trades!

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Thanks kawangkoan, yes that will make sure not to miss a trade but it will also mean a bit more loss if the trade is going in the wrong direction. Then everything comes down to beeing more experienced and chosing the trades with great care. A lot more practice is needed for my part. Cheers Waez

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Yeah I think the great thing about VPLT is that it gets you looking at the price/volume constantly so over time you become a much better ticker reader and develop a great intuition for price movements. :nerd:

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Recommend trading at (or very near) close of candle. You will find that near close (M15) their can be some major price moves that bite you. However, if you are leaning short to trade to a price level, and price climbs in an open candle then pips can be made in an open candle. This is definitely more risk ridden and you should be in the "trade zone" of watching the market for a while before jumping in this way. Just be careful.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Nice Thread Spud! Subscribed. Thanks, sjc

--- 帖子 #514 ---
This is an open Sell trade just taken on GJ. Here is my thinking on this trade: So in the first group of bars circled in red, price is moving down, volume peaks, and you see a little bull where volume drops. After the little bull where volume drops I'm thinking this is a potential turning pattern, a bread and butter pattern. However, the first bar in the second group circled in red, shows price moving back down to my level at 140.30, and volume drops. So to verify the turn I would have needed another bull candle on higher volume, or a least a spike in volume as price moved down to hit my level. A drop in volume on the bear candle I took to mean that buyers just aren't interest in coming here to move price back up. So I need another bear candle moving down on higher volume to verify this line of thought. So the next candle that's exactly what I got. Price moved down through 140.30 on higher volume and retraced a little at the end of the 15 min, which let me sell at 140.28. Aiming for 140.05, gives me a little better than 1 to 1. So we'll see how it works out.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hi, I didn´t have time to trade today but looked at the charts afterwards. Although I could see three entries I probably would have taken 1,2 and 3 where no 3 is the best I think, the market never established itself above PL1.3015 and below 1.2985 during the whole LO and therefore a lot of opportunites would appear for the one abel to read the PL and Volume in that tradingrange. Spudfyre, I would very much appreciate, and I hope I´m not asking to much, if you would like to go through the attached chart and point out obvious candles/volumebars that to you reveals where the market will go and where it´s unlikely to go. Regards Waez http://i47.tinypic.com/2gy3iiv.gif

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hello, I´ve just taken these trades, Going short at 2 after that 1 showed no interest in higher PL. Exit at 3 with +8 pips. After 3 which closed on low volume I went long at 4, currently a couple of pips in front. Cheers Waez http://i45.tinypic.com/2efuznp.gif

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hello, On which flow you work ? What you call volume are simply tick. You need to work on a centralized market for volumes coherent, the future FX market for example. Did you know the FX spot market is otc ?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I would have to respecfully disagree .. If you look at the activity level within the context of PA vs. Tick Volume it paints a pretty clear picture.. IMHO.. There has been research you can find ... regarding the slight difference between Contract Volume vs Tick Volume.. The point is: I believe it's the activity level within the context of the preceeding volume that allows us to use Tick Volume in a unique way " it helps you see behind the price - so to speak " When I trade futures I tend to look at volume in the traditional way.. but on both sides it is a determination of acvtivity. Extremes, abrupt changes.. within the context .. add PA.. you have something unique IMHO.. Yes there could be alot more to this dicussion to be sure. Just my 2 pips TSD

Hi, I took this trade yesterday afternoon GMT when it was quiet. 1 and 2 gives PL1.3110 and hints at no interest in higher prices. 3 and 4 confirms no interset in higher prices 5 and 6 gives PL 1,3085 and hints at no interest in lower prices 6,7,8,9 and 10 ricing prices with falling volume makes a sell entry on 11 viable and it´s a winner. http://i50.tinypic.com/z1u9e.gif Regards Waez

Nice! I've had a break from trading for a while but I'll be back in. What is your average profit per trade with VPLT? I've noticed mine is quite low, usually only getting less than 10 pips. Spud, do you have other PA methods to take advantage of the big moves that VPLT sometimes misses. Cheers

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi dkoleary, I´m still on demo while getting a better knowledge about this approach. Some setups are quite straigthforward like my last post and also the pullbacktrades when the market is clearly trending. I would like to be able to analyze better when the market is clearly ranging and waiting for a trigger, see attached pics. The candles are sitting on the PL like birds on a wire but at what direction will they fly? http://i49.tinypic.com/2n2l54.gif http://i45.tinypic.com/23r7j3t.gif http://i45.tinypic.com/23r7j3t.jpg

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Yeah it's hard to pick the exact timing and also hard to see whether the volume has peaked and is going to pull back or its going to keep going down..

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hahaha....good illustration!

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I`ve been thinking about the same and getting a bit annoyed that I often would miss the big moves due to poor pricevolume reading skills. The below is probably well known to the most of you but dawned on me today: There´s is no need to be worried about missing the start of a big move on high volume since the momentum will drive the price further and in most cases bring in 10+ pips. These trades seems to have very little drawdowns aswell so a SL of 10 pips is enough. Look att the pics below, when the price breaks away +15-20 pips on high volume its quite safe to enter at the start of the new candle. I did it today as you can see for 25 pips and it´s was a big relief to let go of the tension involved trying to find the exactly best entrypoint. If not being sure it´s better to wait for clear confirmation and then get in for a good prtion of the move, or a very small loss. Today the price tried to break away long from the tradingrange through the well established trendchannel just to come back in again so a short entry was prefered. Regards Waez http://i45.tinypic.com/vzhh87.gif http://i45.tinypic.com/16kdrp1.gif http://i47.tinypic.com/2z7pt34.gif http://i48.tinypic.com/1yoe8.gif

You probably have noticed that VPLT will pick off the peaks at the "tops" and "bottoms" of price movement. That's probably a discussion for a different thread, but it can be used to enter and exit these with some sound money management. The trick of course is being able to find the entry where you don't need large stops. I prefer to look for consistency and grabbing 20 pips a day that I can bank on. You simply make more money versus pips this way. If you can consistently earn 10 pips..i.e. let's say every day you can earn 10 pips...then just increase the value of your pips...that's way easier than trying to land 50 pip trades. 5 pips at $10 each or 50 pips at $1 each...which do you think will make you more money in a month?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Spud, your transition trading sounded very nice but it's not quite right. If I overlay OBV on Volume, I get huge discrepancies when scrolling the chart, the same applies when new bars come in. At first the OBV sits on ~40% of the vol bar, after the second bar it is up, sits on 55%, and after a third it's above 75% of the vol bar. At the third bar I realize there should have been a trade, but there's a saying that hindsight is an exact science... It seems you knocked up OBV on Volume in a very short space of time and not thoroughly testing it through. Mind you, I'm not blaming you, you tried to make VPLT reading better and easier for people like me. Is there any chance to have a revisit and make it more accurate?

How's VPLT trading going, guys? Obviously Spud is gone, so time to take matters into our own hands. I was thinking about the drawback of putting OBV on Volume - it repaints and is not reliable. How to make it reliable? Well, what if we turn OBV into stochastic oscillator? It would look like this: define a period, find the low point and the high point of OBV and then compare current reading with the low and high points. It would not repaint and give readings from 0-100. Drawback would be if it stays on 100 or 0 for a prolonged time. Any comments?

It looks like this, compared to standard OBV. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This strategy doestn work for me so I gave up.Its a waste of time. Favorite's strategy is very much easy to gain 10 pips in one of his pattern.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Chasing trends - you can use VPLT to start a trade and jump in with your favourite trend following strategy. You can also use VPLT to delay a trend strategy entry...going for the 10-15 pip move first and then weighing the merits of your trend strategy to follow the trend. You can also broaden VPLT and look for price levels that play wider apart. You can also use VPLT to signal changes in the trend. VPLT has many uses if you wish to see what the market is doing now. Stochastics are a great aid to chasing a trend. My articles on Elevator to Pips is a great follow after a VPLT launch. You can use VPLT to stop a trend chase.....by watching the price levels emerge, each would be a decision as you follow the stochastic levels along. Just make sure you are choosing the best stochastic signatures over multiple time frames and still stick to VPLT on the M15 as a signal maker when each price level is created. Chasing a trend this way does take a lot of attention through the trend, so only optimal if you have the time to stick to the trade...i.e. be prepared to be glued to your computer screen for several hours.

Hi Spud I have discovered this thread and another older one from you in the late 48 hours, and I must say I LOVE YOUR approach to the markets ! One question which I think is quite relevant to this thread : are you aware or the Marney approach to "volume" in forex markets ? As you know, volume or "interest" in forex is very dependant on the time of day, also depending on the currency you are trading. The basic idea is : if you take your EurUsd pair, volume will be very low (in general) from 22:00 GMT till 5 or 6 GMT, then will start to pick up, and will make significant progress till 11 GMT then pause somewhat, then pick up again around 12 or 13 GMT and usually spike a daily top around 16 till 17 GMT. Of course there are exceptions, but generally speaking there are huge differences between the overnight (GMT) and the London-US session volumes ! So a certain guy, MArney, credit be given to him, had the idea to compare volumes and growth or decay of volume during the day, not only from one candle to the next, but also putting each time period of day in relation with the same time periods of day during the former X days. Not sure if I am clear here ! Anyway in short it means that a spike of, let's say 100 at 4:00 GMT can be a big spike if the average for that time period of day was 50 in the last 20 days, even if at 14:00 GMT the average volume would be around 500. An indicator for this is available on the web, and I was thinking maybe an oscillator based on that idea would also be helpful to your appoach, which, by any standards that I know of, is paramount !!! Anyway, I am just at the beginning of this thread, but I intend to try and figure out some way of integrating this Marney approach to your concepts. One other thought, just going through a couple of examples lately, I find that your theory goes perfectly in harmony with another one based on "supply-demand" concepts. But this is just ok, and both ideas reflect the same thing : people are more willing to buy, or sell, at a determined level, or not ! And this can definitely be read, like a tape, along the charts. So not only do I love your approach, but I want to sincerely thank you for you ability to share and explain and convince ! So many things I don't feel capable of doing ! (still feeling like a worm trying hard to survive in this dangerous (but so exciting) world of forex !!) THX

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Just an example to illutrate what I was saying : the blue line in the volume indicator is the average in the last (10, user parameter) days, for the current bar, whatever the timeframe. You can see that the spike of interest around 2:00 GMT was a genuine one, compared to the average volume for that time of day.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks for the info BlueJay. I should mention that my approach isn't looking at the volume number but rather the volume peaks, that is a high volume bar surrounded by a lower volume bar on each side. It is the way volume and price work together where volume is a "relative" reaction. Volume is used on the basis that just about every other trader out there uses indicators (not saying that is a bad thing) to make a trade decision and the relative volume movement is reactionary based on those decisions -- "relative" to each other. You can see this "relative" phenomenon by looking at volume and say stochastics head to head and looking at where the better trade opportunities fell in stochastics compared to how the volume peaked. I'm simplifying my explanation a great deal here, but in general that's the how I'm using volume peaks. I'll give Marney a read.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I just love VPLT and so far its working great for me.if you don't mind spudfire would u kindly use charts to explain it when using the elevator to pips system together with VPLT to chase the trend ?i belive it will greatly assist in understanding VPLT.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
It's always a pleasure to listen and study to Spudfyre trading lessons ! Ok I've never traded using volume stuff but it's really fascinating as it's presented in this sound approaching presented in this thread, so I played a little bit in a demo account, I don't know if I played following rules and hope that I catch devil So here's my first VPLT trade : since yesterday night there was in my understanding a price level at 1.3040 and this morning at 9:15 a volume peak appears with determinator candle again around 1.3040 so my thought was that market won't go up, so waited for next candle after determinator which was down with volume increased , so I shorted at the open of next candle (the one with red arrow) with 10 pips tp and sl (R:R 1:1) since I cannot see a clear level below I prefer a less risky approach. Luckily (or devil was right? ehhe), price go south and banked 10 pips (demo pips unfortunately). Hope to see Spudfyre reply to check if I did right or it was only lucky Cheers, Skyline

--- 帖子 #551 ---
After first trade closed sucessfully, waited market to show his hands , at 10:15 a new volume peak formed with price level at 1.3020 (based on determinator candle rule), so waited few candle and while price was going up interest (volume) went down so I thought market didn't like to go up , my bias was still short , so after 2 up candle with volume decreasing opened another short (second red arrow), with tp at 1.3020. Price went down as I thought , but volume decreased so I bailed out at the close of down candle with +10 pips, if i had waited next candle was still down and 1.3020 level reached, btw I'm happy with my 10 immaginary pips It seems so simple to read the market in this way, of course there will be bad trade that occurs. Cheers, Skyline

--- 帖子 #552 ---
While I'm programming I still follow this funny eurusd market, a new volume peak formed at 11:45 (orange vert line) with new price level at 1.3000, again I waited some candles which went up while interest goes down so market don't like so much previous price level at 1.3020, so I shorted at 4th candle after peak candle with tp at 1.3000 and sl a little bit larger at 1.3040. Market went south as expected , sl moved to entry at 1.3015 so this is a free trade I cannot loose anything now , candle is down with volume slightly up so i stayed in to see if 1.3000 is reached , if not I will exit with some demo pips gained Edit : price finally went up so closed trade with 0 pips , not bad!

Again, volume peak formed at 12:45 (where my previous trade was entered and then closed at breakeven), with new price level at 1.3010 then price goes up while interest went down , so bias is still short for me , waited few candle to see if market liked 1.3010 but this wasn't the case , so shorted again at forth red arrow with tp at previous price line 1.3000 and sl at 1.3020. Trade was again succesfull around 10 pips gained , today opened 4 trade, 3 winning , 1 at breakeven , gained around 30 pips I wish my pips today was real and big enough as value Btw I'm amazed on how this system put trader on right track , Thx Spudfyre ! Cheers, Skyline

Great trades, Skyline! But these make me ask one question - how do you time your entry? Can you tell me why you waited till the 4th candle on couple of trades? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Let's save this thread, so we can get more skill and knowledge from this trading lessons by Spudfyre!

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Absolutely kawagkoan. I've been waiting for weeks for more examples from Spud. But thanks to skyline (ciao) I'm back.

I also asking myself the same thing looking again at chart Well said that I'm no master at all about this method which I red for the first time two days ago, I simply tried to apply Spud's rules the best in my understanding, when I saw a volume pick followed by 3 up candle (could also be 2 or 1) and volume decreasing that was a signal that market doesn't like to go up , there was no strenght or in Spud's term no 'interest' so I shorted. I agree that I was lucky to pick exactly the turning point in quite all of this trades , but in anycase even if I entered one or two candle before my stops won't be hit since it was above where the previous price level was set. It was like 6 month/1 year since I opened MT4 and look at a chart , maybe today was some sort of easy market to play with , and in range market it will be much more difficult to pick the right entry candle , but even if you are in wrong direction, following volume/price action togheter should avoid big losses (at least this is what I hope) Cheers, Skyline

I'm wondering if this indicator marketprofile which should show on chart where tick volume for each quotes is, could be of any help trading VPTL. Spud do you think we could integrate in VPTL as a confirmation about price level ? Cheers, Skyline

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I've never used Marketprofile, but I've seen it. It may help illustrate where the stronger price levels are, but without seeing it in action and using it, I can't say much. I'll definitely play with it and add a few comments later on.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I've never used it too but remember was used somewhere here in FF , maybe could be helpful to identify first price level based on previous day values for newbie like me, infact looking at my previous chart it seems 3 price level (1.3040,1.3010,1.2990) were identified correctly. Will wait for your response about it using in real time Cheers, Skyline

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Bad trades happens , but look after the fact I think my error could be avoided. Started my day with two price level one at 1.2990 from previous day and another at 1.2965 which I spotted since it's a volume peak at 2:15 also confirmed by marketprofile. So I had the feeling that market interest was down since there was up candle from 7:30 to 8:45 but volume wasn't spike so market doesn't seems to go above 1.2990, then 2 down candles appeared with higher volume (showed with X mark on graph and the second one was a volume peak) which fooled me because I shorted at the open of next candle with a sl at 1.2990 which was hit few candles later. As I can see a much more wise approach could be to put a sell stop at 1.2990 since I know price hardly could go above that level. Shorting at 1.2990 as you can see could give at least 25 pips, so in the end my hurry to be in market misguided me and I lose pips, hope I learned this lesson !

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hi Skyline, could you please elaborate more about the using of marketprofile on VPLT? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi kawangkoan, I'm studying to understand if this indicator could be of some help in live trading, if you look at my previous chart , when you put it on chart it shows with an horizontal histogram where tick volume is for each price, so the more bar is extended on the left the more interest should be around that price (at least this is how I understand it). In my chart this morning , marketprofile signal an horizonal spike at around 1.2965 which was confirmed also by volume spike at 2:15. So marketprofile maybe could be used as a sort of confirmation about forming price level, but as I said in my previous post I'm neither master using this indicator nor trading VPLT which i'm studying too. Let's wait Spud's comment about it !

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi, nice postings Skyline and good to see this thread live up again: You got a new PL@1.29800 created by candle 1 and 2 see line on the chart below, so at that point there´s not much info to enter on Candle 2 I think. Candle 2 is up with lower volume and candle 3 again up with even lower volume. After candle 3 a good possibility to go short is showing it self and would have been a winner. Regards Waez http://i41.tinypic.com/2e3n5ts.png

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hi Waez, yes there was a new level at 1.2980 but I shorted at the start of candle 2 so I didn't know at that time there was a peak and a new level forming at a lower price, maybe a larger stoploss at 1.3010 could helped me to stay out of trouble, but definitelly it was not a good trade and as you said I had to wait some candle for better confirmation. Btw I shorted again later in the day 3 times when price touched 1.2990 which in my view was a very strong level with market not so prone to go up so I shorted with no mercy so in the end was a costructive and positive day Thx Cheers, Skyline

Hi Skyline, I came across market profile indi very recently and am hopeful that it can be put to use with VPLT. IMHO applying it to M1 chart could give the most accurate results. Do share your insights abt this indi with us.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Thank you Skyline for your response and Waez, as usual, great analysis ......thank you

Hello Spudfyre Thank you for this great thread. Last few days I was reading digesting and trying your lessons on demo. For the first time my scalping makes profits. Still don't feel comfortable with my understanding of it but I know there's price to be payd - effort. And I'm willing to pay that as much as necessary. You have promised to show a long entry and then some variations to entry signals in upcoming posts. But there were no upcoming posts. Could you continue and prepare a few new lessons? Thanx

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi Krystyn, I apologize, my perception of where people understand the concept and where I beat something to death can sometimes be off kilter. I'd be happy to add some more examples if that would help with clarity. I'll put together a long entry this weekend and post here (yes I did promise, so I should do it, eh!) . If there are other specifics you would like to see, I'd be glad to explain/examplify.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Spudfyre, Yeah , more examples would be really really nice. Alternatively as suggested before, you could do a video clip. A 15min clip could cover a lot of candles. Just a humble suggestion.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Hi Spudfyre Last 4 days I was staring at EU with volumes, obv and macd. Must say that macd didn't help much but it's my double fault - the pair was slow so I switched to M1 and I'm in the process of training my perception - my brain still refuses to process data from more than 3 sources (pa, vol, obv). Still had several quick profitable scalps. Btw - price was playing perversly with round number 1.31000 for a long time (over, under, over, under...) so looking at volume made more sense than looking at round number. Edit: The pair started moving. Bad scalps happened. Lesson learned - if price moves quick enough OBV has no space to tell you the truth. Back to 15M. Next time I will change pair not TF.

Greetings to all! For MT4 made ​​full implementation of the CME futures and volumes, besides writing that all officially. He inquired of them the source of indicators - promised to give, but it will work only for them anyway. It looks like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) At the forum they have a description. On the demo data are delayed by 15 minutes. I do not know the link you can give, or not ... you are interested in Google can be found, called Arsenal-forex. In any case, you can normally use without the complexity and volume in MT4.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Don't die on me now thread! I've just found you! Price level at 1.3265. Second candle to the right has high volume and price is rising (away form price level). I'm long here as price doesn't seem interested in returning to 1.3265 level. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
This is a very excellent and informational thread. First trade of the day using VPLT. 10pips done. Price level 1.3305 is the level of interest. More interest below this level than above. So sell : )

--- 帖子 #575 ---
is this thread dead? I'd love to get everyone back together to see how they are doing.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Well I had completly forgot about this thread. I have re-read the system again and think I undertsand it. I have attched my first trade using this system. Screen shot attached with the order. Ignore the failed trades those are not this system. The last sell is. 20 tp 20 sl. Look how it screamed away from my interest lines. Im aiming for 20 pips per trade. I dont have a lot of time to trade so this system suits me. I will just increase the lot size according to my budgets etc. Demo only for now untill I can get this nailed down.

By far my favourite thread at FF, pity that it's not active anymore. I find the trading style very engaging and really enjoyed trying to be better at it.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I wish thiss thread is alive again and hope some of the former members will start to write again. This way of trading is literally having an ATM on your screen.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Does anyone still post to this thread? Instead of volume I use ATR. As you know, there is no volume in the FX market. Anyway, my reason for posting here is I was wondering if any uses OBV(on balance volume)? In particular anyone use OBV but instead of volume use ATR? Thanks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Old thread I know, but there's a pdf here on FF that shows that there is a strong correlation between price (tick) volume and actual traded volume in FX, using data provided by HotSpot and EBS. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...2&amp;d=1409151391

My gut tells me to STAY OUT of that particular Candle 1. It's smack in the middle of "no man's land" (between 2 PL's), despite the price-volume both showing interest upward. As I wait and keep my eye on Candle 3, when I see it stretch down near 3427 (matching up to 6 candles back) and then volume/interest shoving back up so far...this is DEFINITELY a sign for me to go long. The volume that goes along with Candle 3 is just Ginormous in comparison the previous volume. Side note: Candle 3 is also happening around 15:30, if I'm reading the small text on the chart correctly. The futures market for the /6E (which is moving the E/$) has closed. A large volume spike is expected (just like other futures markets, like /ES). Typical volume profile (high in the morning, low during lunch, high again as market nears closing).
