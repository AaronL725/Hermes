From what i see you are marking "Imbalance" of the price, a fundamental concept of ICT trading methods. I studied this method but i don't use/love it because a lot of ppl are using it. Correct me if i'm wrong. »»————- Remember it's only my personal opinion, i'm not giving financial advice ————-««

Hello Forex, I follow your previous posts. Thanks for the information you provide. I have a small question: In your wick identification how can you tell difference if wick will work or not. I mean in history it's easy to spot which worked, however there are tons of them which don't work and just continue to go same direction. Especially in crypto =)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You want to check the higher timeframes for directional Bias especially the Daily and make sure your wick is taking out liquidity.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I was trading this way long before I started studying from ICT methods.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I did not really know why wicks worked at that time but I knew they did

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Just took this trade a few minutes ago

Also if you know how to use fibs along with liquidity you can trade pullbacks and you don’t have to use the Daily bias. I also do that since I have been using fibs for years

It is an ICT concept yeah. A lot of people use it but in a wrong way mostly, same with any other strategy.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I subcribed immediately when I see your pictures and you pointed out you used to trade those points before learning ICT. Yes those point also were peak and troughs, and the technique is ridiculous becau se it is simil ar catching the knife Do we have too," check the higher timeframes for directional Bias especially the Daily"? I only see there is $ I dont care which bias, MM will sure take it. soon or later Study how/why/what wicks works could be a gold mine ... see Rob Hoffman trading and the IVT inventory candle, that could be an other definition cover, hide what our human kind re always doing, like when our ancestor look at a dog, a buffalo, a bird ... there is only two ways, eat it or keep it as pet

'how can you tell difference if wick will work or not. I mean in history it's easy to spot which worked, however there are tons of them which don't work and just continue to go same direction. Especially in crypto' ... are those wicks , extreme wicks turning in to places of BOS? and give indication $ was there but you need to learn instruction to unravel to somewhere, where the $ is now hidden ...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
"but in a wrong way mostly, same with any other strategy. " interesting could pls help me a little bit more

--- 帖子 #24 ---
If I am looking at 1 Min Buyside or Sellside Liquidity wick I will then go up to a 5Min and 15 Min timeframe and see if everything is going in the same directional bias so I guess you really don’t have to go as high as the daily. I would say it depends on what timeframe you wick is on that you want to trade.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Champ! I see all your Trade decisions are concluded on the M15. Could you kindly help with a brief on how you analyse &amp; make Trade Entries &amp; Exits based on your Liquidity Wicks trading system? I'm curious to understand how you interpret the wicks, you know. I appreciate all you do here. Thanks in anticipation!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Well what like to do as I did this morning is go through all pairs on the 15 timeframe and look for wicks that have took out liquidity and if I find something that looks good I will drop down to the 5Min and 1 Min and if everything is moving in the same direction I will then look to enter on the 1 Min timeframe as I did this morning

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Price Action must agree just because you have a wick that does not make it an instant trade

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Well that trade did not work out If I would have went to the 1 HR timeframe you can see there is a Buyside Liquidity wick

--- 帖子 #42 ---
What I mean is that for various reasons, people use ICT concepts in the wrong way, and they find themselves against the real market direction. One of the reasons is that they don't strictly follow their rules, or they interpret what ICT or other mentors say differently from what it's meant to be. Also, a lot of traders get "analysis paralysis" and can't define whether the market will go up or down, they see both being a possibility and can't choose which direction to choose.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
We have more than 30 years of datas is there any study or project study about statistic how many times fake out come more often in GU than EU how many times if the last asian session &gt;50 pips the London session H4 candle will show a wick larger than 15 pips how often if London is an up-session, NY would start with a down phase etc... where can we see such statistics on general monitoring, useful or non-useful

--- 帖子 #44 ---
...can't define whether the market will go up or down... well I agree this is a big problem, not simple as ppl say if price &gt; 200ema keep looking for buy opportunity... There are even school there they dont care about market is up or down, they just react on if market behaves like a sell market you sell; if like buy market you buy ; when finishing sell then they begin to sell, when finishing sell then they buy

--- 帖子 #45 ---
EU wick is $ update: Last up leg retraced only 38.2%, bull force still too strong. but if can not break above 1.114 then EU still in bearish state, $ grab around 1.097 could still happen

--- 帖子 #46 ---
UJ BoJ does intervene, but it has fallen too steep, nerly hit the 800ema. Look at the wicks on the left could it be a case wick hides $ update after then continue to get to the goal TP2 161.8%, bu then it complete a deep retracement, I guess it will revers going back up and will grab $ on the way up or we can say it clear all on-the-way-up engineered liquidity/targets

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I am noticing there seems to always be a FVG formed after a 1HR liquidity wick that can be used as an entry. I will have to test this out to see how effective it works

Nice pictures,care to explain how this works?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Let me first ask you are you familiar with ICT Trader concepts? If not you need to go to his YouTube channel and check him out!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Where do you place your stop loss? Above the FVG or above the last high/low? I think in the first post you should write about the entry rules and links to material to help people who don’t know about ICT start learning, like in Bilal’s thread, he linked videos and materials about every ICT concept he uses

--- 帖子 #52 ---
EU wicks up there, look in the past an impulse down, gave us POI, we did a return to origin, rect nd get pushed away swiftly. Now in the past we had big unfilled gap up there... hence we will go grab $ above those upper wicks, then perhaps partially fill the gap the my direction hence up, I see TP at the prev daily high D1_high_1

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Yes that sounds good I will have to find the right videos for the concepts of his that I use. I think I have one problem though I never found a video of his where he uses wicks in his trading.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Also can you still use the FVG indicator? It disappeared from my tradingview and I can’t find it anymore…

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I dont know how you want to interpret them, but for me a FVG is the trace of an impuls candle, where you FVG you can be sure an OB is newl created, near there is the POI and wick associated with $, in form of EQH/EQL or the tip of Mountain or Waterall (A or V) the also place of $

Three candle reversal pattern with FVG The first step is going to a high time frame starting with daily Timeframe then four hour time frame then one hour and then 15 minute. We want to catch all the swing trades in the direction of the higher timeframe. We can catch trades on low time frames like five minute and one minute. The set up is 3 candle pattern. We mark the opening of the right candle in this pattern with a line. We drop down to a lower timeframe looking for an imbalance that creates FVG (fair value gap) price pulls away from this area then back into the FVG and we take our trade out of this when it starts to reverse. These patterns can be found on all timeframes. We trade in the direction of the Daily and 4 HR timeframe just to reiterate. If you been trading awhile and can see other things you can modify this or add to it with whatever you want. This is where experience comes in that new traders can’t see yet.Targets can be higher timeframe FVG’s or Orderblocks or fib levels or Quadrant levels ect.

Hola Forexholy! How you know that there are liquidity on wicks?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
If you back track your charts and look at where price has reversed where there are equal highs or equal lows of candles and price goes beyond that and leaves a wick this is where peoples stops have been taken out. The books teach the retailed trader to put there stops at these places and the algorithm is designed to take out your stops.

Hi, thx for your explanation. I have seen the ICT vids before, but I noticed that the most market structure traders like Bilal are trading a bit more "freestyle" than following ICT's rules religiously. For example, your S&amp;P 500 set up example doesn't include some kind of buy side/sell side liquidity taken.

I posted this on page 7 Three candle reversal pattern with FVG The first step is going to a high time frame starting with daily Timeframe then four hour time frame then one hour and then 15 minute. We want to catch all the swing trades in the direction of the higher timeframe. We can catch trades on low time frames like five minute and one minute. The set up is 3 candle pattern. We mark the opening of the right candle in this pattern with a line. We drop down to a lower timeframe looking for an imbalance that creates FVG (fair value gap) price pulls away from this area then back into the FVG and we take our trade out of this when it starts to reverse. These patterns can be found on all timeframes. We trade in the direction of the Daily and 4 HR timeframe just to reiterate.

Hi, congratulations, great thread, loving it! Could explain how you determined your bias long on your audnzd trade ? On M1 making new lows, i'd eventually take a short at the upper FVG targeting sellside liquidity below...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
If you notice in my first picture There was a FVG above that had a ITL that was took out by a FVG so that area needed to be mitigated. Price below formed a FVG that had an ITH or break of structure price returned into the FVG and I took the trade.

Hello Forexholly. I like the exchange that you have taught, I understand that you used a previous OB and the 3 candle reversal. it was very close the balance zone. Does the entry make it when it reaches the FVG zone or when the candle that takes the zone closes? I'm still researching ICT. Thanks

Should be when it reaches the FVG

hello Forexholy untill now i don't undestand how you work. so sir firtly you looking for the 3 candle reverse. can you show us this candles??? so when we find the 3 candle reverse , next we looking for (frametime down) a FVG?? is excactly or no. i'm sorry for my language

--- 帖子 #322 ---
ok to answer your question firstly I hope you are familiar with ICT concepts if not you will need to go to ICT Trader YouTube channel and begin to watch his videos. I look for the 3 candle reversal pattern on the 1 HR and 15 Min timeframes I really prefer the 1 Hr. This would be in the Direction of a Daily or 4HR FVG for a target. It really needs to be taking out Buyside or Sellside Liquidity.After finding it I drop down to lower timeframes as low as the 1 Min looking for a FVG for entry. If there is a Market Maker Model present, it makes the trade even better.

What Breaking the 4-Minute Mile Taught Us About the Limits of Conventional Thinking March 09, 2018 Save The sad news of the passing of Roger Bannister , the first human being to run a four-minute mile, got me thinking about his legacy — not just as one of the great athletes of the past century, but as an innovator, a change agent, and an icon of success. As it turns out, when he broke through a previously impenetrable track-and-field barrier, he taught all of us what it takes to break new ground. Most people know the basic story of Roger Bannister, who, on May 6, 1954, busted through the four-minute barrier with a time of three minutes, fifty-nine and four-tenths of a second. But it was not until I decided to write about him for my book Practically Radical , and read a remarkable account of his exploits by the British journalist and runner John Bryant , that I understood the story behind the story — and the lessons it holds for leaders who want to bust through barriers in their fields. Bryant reminds us that runners had been chasing the goal seriously since at least 1886, and that the challenge involved the most brilliant coaches and gifted athletes in North America, Europe, and Australia. “For years milers had been striving against the clock, but the elusive four minutes had always beaten them,” he notes. “It had become as much a psychological barrier as a physical one. And like an unconquerable mountain, the closer it was approached, the more daunting it seemed.” This was truly the Holy Grail of athletic achievement. It’s fascinating to read about the pressure, the crowds, the media swirl as runners tried in vain to break the mark. Bryant also reminds us that Bannister was an outlier and iconoclast — a full-time student who had little use for coaches and devised his own system for preparing to race. The British press “constantly ran stories criticizing his ‘lone wolf’ approach,” Bryant notes, and urged him to adopt a more conventional regimen of training and coaching. So the four-minute barrier stood for decades — and when it fell, the circumstances defied the confident predictions of the best minds in the sport. The experts believed they knew the precise conditions under which the mark would fall. It would have to be in perfect weather — 68 degrees and no wind. On a particular kind of track — hard, dry clay — and in front of a huge, boisterous crowd urging the runner on to his best-ever performance. But Bannister did it on a cold day, on a wet track, at a small meet in Oxford, England, before a crowd of just a few thousand people. When Bannister broke the mark, even his most ardent rivals breathed a sigh of relief. At last, somebody did it! And once they saw it could be done, they did it too. Just 46 days Bannister’s feat, John Landy, an Australian runner, not only broke the barrier again, with a time of 3 minutes 58 seconds. Then, just a year later, three runners broke the four-minute barrier in a single race . Over the last half century, more than a thousand runners have conquered a barrier that had once been considered hopelessly out of reach. Well, what goes for runners goes for leaders running organizations. In business, progress does not move in straight lines. Whether it’s an executive, an entrepreneur, or a technologist, some innovator changes the game, and that which was thought to be unreachable becomes a benchmark, something for others to shoot for. That’s Roger Bannister’s true legacy and lesson for all of us who see the role of leadership as doing things that haven’t been done before. In fact, two Wharton School professors have analyzed the lessons for business of the four-minute mile . In their book, The Power of Impossible Thinking , Yoram Wind and Colin Crook they devote an entire chapter to an assessment of Bannister’s feat, and emphasize the mindset behind it rather than the physical achievement. How is it, they wonder, that so many runners smashed the four-minute barrier after Bannister became the first to do it? “Was there a sudden growth spurt in human evolution? Was there a genetic engineering experiment that created a new race of super runners? No. What changed was the mental model. The runners of the past had been held back by a mindset that said they could not surpass the four-minute mile. When that limit was broken, the others saw that they could do something they had previously thought impossible.” Most thinking about strategy, competition, and leadership emphasizes the intricacies of business models: revenues, costs, niches, leverage. But mental models are what allow organizations and their leaders to try not just to be the best at what everyone else can do, but to do things that only they can do — which, over time, shows others what it possible. They don’t accept the limitations, tradeoffs, and middle-of-the-road sensibilities that define conventional wisdom. In other words, great leaders don’t just out-perform their rivals. They transform the sense of what’s possible in their fields. That’s what makes icons like Roger Bannister so unforgettable — and so important.

ah oh sir, so: for exemple the - EUR/USD dailyframe is down for this we loking for top 3 candles revese (swing high) , and next we look dow 1 minure frame for looking for FVG for for enter sell - or i we have on 4HR FVG top and the price is down we looking firtly on 1HR the 3 candle down(swing down) and next on 1MINUTE we searching the FVG for enter buy that's it or i'm wrong , waiting for response sir

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Well let’s see I traded the EUR/USD today as there was news As I said before we look for a higher timeframe target which would be a FVG on Daily or 4HR or 1HR and this could be all of these as long as they are in the same direction of your trade I then normally go to the 1HR timeframe looking for a 3 candle reversal pattern when found I start dropping down in timeframes looking for a FVG I will go as low as 1 minute but not in all cases there could be one on the 5 or 3 minute timeframe. Then I wait for price to enter the FVG and take my trade targeting the nearest high timeframe FVG or Liquidity.

Not sure of your question but here is the reason could have took a short trade.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
No -Three red triangles (over a high bar )fractal?) from the RIGHT is a high bar around1.6400. There is a FVG there -trading that FVG long would be a fail? (Two red markers from the right is another high of a FVG for a short trigger that wanders sideways?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Ok I think I see and understand your question 1.)FVG’s can fail 2.) Order blocks can fail When doing your analysis on the beginning of this trade the consensus of the higher timeframe is to take only short trades no longs.We were coming down from a Premium area. Yes you could risk trying to trade pullbacks But that would be considered a low risk trade Why do that when your analysis is to trade short.

Still unsure when you take your entry... so, on this chart, is it at 1 or 2 ? I think most SMCers would take entry at 2. Attached Image (click to enlarge) thank you.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
When the 3 candle reversal occurs in H1, it looks for a FVG in that impulse in the lower timeframe, which should be filled later, so I understand that it would be in 1 regardless of 2. If I'm wrong, then please correct me Forexholy

--- 帖子 #378 ---
You are dead right very good analysis!

--- 帖子 #379 ---
This is not most SMCers trading style. This is something I figured out from combining ICT Traders concepts with my 12 years of experience of trading the markets. As far as I know ICT Traders has only 1 video series teaching a type of 3 candle reversal pattern and he does not teach it like this. (ICT - Mastering High Probability Scalping)

He has said on a few of his videos that you can take his concepts and develop a trading style that can work for you!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
alright, thanks I think I understood now. So, in fact, we're not waiting for any BOS or CHoCH on the H1 or M15 and then waiting for the H1 FVG to be tapped back into many hours later, but actually going along immediately with the 1H imbalance and entering on LTF at the nearest FVG.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I really like the way you adapted the concepts. many thanks!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
When you use the liquidity wicks, is it just because they have liquidated on some highs? or for further confirmation do those wicks also have to touch an OrderBlock?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Yes because they have liquidated highs or lows depending on which direction you are trading. They have actually tooken peoples stops out and reversed direction.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
If there is an orderblocked formed it would be after the wick. I myself am not looking for orderblocks but more so FVG's

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I should say my focus is not on the orderblock but the 3 candle reversal that could contain an orderblock and then the FVG.

--- 帖子 #387 ---

I said it because on many occasions I have seen that the price exceeds the FVG a little and reaches what could be a later OB. Ok, thanks for the clarification.

You are welcome!

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I find the more of ICT Traders concepts you study and understand the more trading styles you can develop. The problem I see on youtube is there are certain concepts people have come up with and there are a lot of copycats of those trading styles and people have not developed more styles.

Trying to take advantage of one FVG on M5 and another on M1 under market liquidity, is not exactly how Forexholy does it, but the areas have worked. It must be said that it has stopped me in some attempt, we will continue to improve. Forexholy any indication is welcome Attached Image (click to enlarge)

One question, is the FVG that marks in M15 when it enters or is it a place indicated in case it returns to that point? Because if you wait for the 3 candle reversal in H1, the fill in FVG of M15 has already taken place. Unless you also look at a 3 candle reversal on M15 to enter M5 or M1, without waiting for the pattern on H1 to end.

OK I see on this you would have actually had a 5 Min reversal pattern being that it took out sellside liquidity.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Let me reiterate my prefrence is the 1 HR timeframe but the 3 candle reversal patteren can be traded on any timeframe. It should normally be traded in the direction of the higher timeframe. If you are an experienced trader you can trade pullbacks.

Seen this way it is simple, but when going to look for it there is always a step to complete and they stop when going with very tight SL Perhaps the most important thing is to locate the wicks by breaking an old level at M15 or H1

Could you explain in steps what you're doing? Having a very hard time following what to look for. 1) Look for 3 bar pattern on H1 or 15m 2) Go to 5m or 1m and look for a FVG? Is that all there is? Please help fill in the steps, thank you.

I have, it was just a little confusing on some parts, perhaps you could go into a bit more detail? I am familiar with ICT concepts however, just appears like your strategy may have a few twists added. *Edit Specifically, are you looking at premium and discount on the Daily Tf? Are we looking for FVGs on the lower Tf, inside of the 15m FVG?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
What exactly is it your having trouble understanding? I have given all the details in post 373. If you are familiar with ICT concepts it should be understandable.

I guess my questions revolve around the interplay between 15m and 1m. You said wait for 3 candle reversal and then look for FVG on 15m. If so, where does the 1m/5m come in after that? Why not just enter on the 15m FVG and leave it at that? Also by the time the 15 FVG happens, wouldn't the 1m FVG already be missed?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
15 Min is easy to spot and yes you can enter there but the lower timeframe FVG will give you a better entry and tighter stop loss and no it won’t be missed.

Trader Daye is known for developing and popularizing the Quarterly Theory, which is a trading strategy based on time cycles in the market. Here are the key concepts associated with Trader Daye's approach: 1. Quarterly Theory: This theory divides time into quarters, from micro to macro levels, to interpret market cycles. It applies to yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, 90-minute, and micro cycles 2. AMDX Sequence: Each quarter represents a specific market phase - Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution, and Reversal/Continuation 3. True Opens: Daye emphasizes the importance of "true opens" in different time frames, which are critical points for price action 4. Time-based analysis: Daye believes that time is a crucial factor in causing price movements, challenging the notion that only price matters 5. Higher time frame focus: The theory is most effective when applied to higher time frames (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify significant institutional order flow 6. Integration with ICT concepts: Daye's approach is influenced by Inner Circle Trader (ICT) teachings and is meant to be used alongside concepts like PD Array Matrix and Institutional Price Levels 7. Cyclical market view: Daye's theory suggests that market behavior repeats in cycles, allowing traders to anticipate future movements 8. Risk management: Daye emphasizes the importance of proper risk management and setting daily goals to prevent overtrading Trader Daye's concepts aim to provide a structured approach to understanding market cycles and institutional behavior, potentially improving trade timing and risk management.

Easy use EA

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Guys. Linhngoc has put this exactly post with same worth and same EA on 10 different threads this morning. You know an EA can have dangerous content to your PC. I would be carefull about downloading this EA. And he has never done anything else on FF. This is very suspecious.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Sure, here is the translation: "Thank you for caring about the community. But you are mistaken. I just wanted to share my EA with everyone, because the community has helped me with many ideas to complete it. Sorry for sending it to many groups at the same time."

--- 帖子 #597 ---
EA’s don’t maintain there consistency I don’t use them or promote them and I started trading in 2007

Hi Forexholy, welcome back, now you're focusing on indices instead of forex, right. Can you re-cap some trades and explain how you apply the system to put the entry. I know it could take time but that will be helpful. Thanks a lot, Cheer .

Give me a little time and I will get back to you.

I found your thread recently and on going myself training process with the 2022 Mentorship material list. Should I complete it first or start with 2016-2017 material ? I intend to combine training with back testing, that why I'm interested in how you apply it in realtime chart.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
I would start with the 2016 then 2022 and he just started a 2024 which is super good so far. You really need all this because you can develop your own trading style and what stands out in the market to you. No two traders trade exactly alike.
