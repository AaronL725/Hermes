Here is something I have been noticing for quite a while, and thought it time I got serious about it. This is trading divergence between two highly correlated pairs. I find the correlated pairs at http://www.mataf.net/en/tools/correlation-table I use the daily correlation chart. Presently these pairs have a correlation factor of &gt;80 EUR/USD - EUR/CHF USD/JPY - EUR/JPY - GBP/JPY EUR/USD - USD/CHF (Negative correlation) The chart below shows the EUR/JPY and the GBP/JPY, together. Basically, if one pair makes a lower low and the other does not, you buy the one that does not. If one pair makes a higher high and the other does not, sell the pair that does not. I wait until both pairs have turned in the direction of the trade, before entering. On the charts, I have removed the candles/bars and replaced them with a Simple MA, 1 period, typical price. This gets rid of the whiskers and a lot of the noise. Also, it works and I like it I used a 14 ATR x 2 as both the SL and TP. I chose this at random. It can be improved upon. I used a 4H time frame. It can be traded on any time frame. Here are the results of the chart shown. 8W - 0L Total profit = 1640 pips. This is from Feb.25, 2009 through last Friday. Any questions and suggestions are welcome. I'm sure it can be improved upon. Also, double check my results. I may have overlooked some trades. If I did, I will correct the results. I don't want any EAs or indicators or filters. This one will stand on its own.

thank U and it seems great bill...you test it only one day????

--- 帖子 #3 ---
How are you calculating the correlation based on the 1 hour and daily figures when you are trading on a 4 hour chart? For example on the hourly chart the coreelation between EURUSD and GBPJPY is good at 95.5 but on the daily it is quite low at 14.0 Looks an interesting system. Mister ED

--- 帖子 #4 ---
This strategy seems to looks right through the pair and correlates it with another similar one. Pretty interesting find you've got here. Will follow this thread. One obvious downside with this is that, your eyes have to be glued onto the screen on both pairs to notice a setup. I'm not an expert with Metatrader 4 indicator coding though im learning. I think it would be handy to hear an alert when a setup presents itself. Billbss I see on your post where it says no indicators but a simple alert for the system should be again useful

--- 帖子 #5 ---
If I'm trading a 4H chart, I'll use the daily table. If I trade lower than that, I use the Hourly. The hourly correlated pairs, seem to change correlation a lot. The best thing to do is list the correlated pairs from each chart. Look at their charts and see if they look like each other. If they do- trade them.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I've never seen an indicator that can accurately detect divergence. Usually, just a look at the charts being traded, will tell you if a set up is possible in the near future. One indicator, I would like to have is something to invert a chart- flip it upside down. That would make it possible to trade EUR/USD - USD/CHF. I have one somewhere, but I be darned if I can find it.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
The chart I posted is for a month.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hey Bill, I read you don't want any indis, but I have one that allows you to place two different pair on the same chart. It's useful to me for correlated trading. If you want, I'll post. Also, some excellant dashboards can be made that will signal for you when different pairs are out of synch. I'm not talking about any kind of filter junk, just informational applications. Are you open to those being developed and posted?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Sure. I just don't want to load it down with MAs, MACDs fibs, pivots etc. What you describe may be helpful.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
BenQ can you please post that indi you mentioned?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
ok, here's second chart courtesy of Serega Lykov. Place it on gbpjpy H4, for example, and enter eurjpy and 240 in the inputs and you'll have both on the same chart. I have a few others, and also one that does an inversion like you asked, but I have to dig those out.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thank you very much. That will be helpful.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I think its better to use two different graphs.. but the inversion indi can be still useful.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thank you very much. I have scoured the forums, both Russian and here, but finally this is one of the most looked after indies I have wanted (I am a very mediocre wannabe programmer) and can basically only edit the code, but not knit it all together, like the professional coders who donate to these forums so graciously. Thanks for sharing Serega's indi with us. I'll work magic with this one.......... Ciao Ciao

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Bill, Thanks for this thread. Could you put more examples here? Bob

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Bill, This looks very interesting but can you please post many more chart examples or give a more thorough explanation of each signal and when and where to take each trade. Thanks, Paris

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I'm working on some more charts, right now. I'll probably have them up in a couple of hours.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Here are a couple more examples. In the first chart, GBP/JPY is making a new High (4) and EUR/JPY (2) is not. We will be going short on the EUR/JPY. We wait until both pairs turn down together. That is where the arrow is. We go short EUR/JPY. We set out SL at 2x ATR 14. We set out TP the same. In the second chart EUR/JPY makes a new Low (2) and GBP/JPY does not. We will buy the GBP/JPY when both pairs turn up. This happens at the arrow. We go Long GBP/JPY. The SL and TP are as described above.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hello Bill; Looks like a a nice simple correlation/divergence strat. worth taking a gander. Thanx for sharing. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #20 ---
The best way I know to compare two data sets on the same chart is to normalize the data. This would allow you to place all the pairs you want on the same charts with values between 0.0 and 1.0. Just a random 3 AM thought. Dan

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Dear Bill, Can you describe the theory a bit more of why the nature of this divergence should/does work? Why is it that on a long the pair that makes the lower low should follow and follow-through toward the pair that didn't make the lower low (and the opposite on a short)? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Very interesting system. Can anyone please explain how we can set SL and TP at 2x ATR 14. I really don't know what that means.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I think you're talking about the trade entrance. Seeing an upward movement (for longs) in both pairs, helps insure that an upward movement (for longs) of the pair you are going to trade, is not random, since both pairs have agreed on it.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
There is an MT4 indicator named "Average True Range". It computes the heights (ranges) of the bars (H minus L) and averages them. An ATR 14, is the average range of the last 14 bars. When you enter a trade, look at the current ATR 14. Double it and use that number for your SL and TP.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Bill It's Looking Good, Thanks for sharing this Pip!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Ah yes, pair triangles. If both EURJPY and USDJPY are going up, then it means JPY is getting weaker relative to the movements of the EURUSD. Divergence between the pairs could be seen in large movements in the EURUSD. The old saying "sell weakness, buy strength" comes into play here. Ie: Buy the strongest of the correlated JPY pairs if JPY is showing weakness, or sell the weakest if it's showing strength. The rest is all about getting a good low-risk entry. I routinely trade the GBPUSD/EURGBP/EURUSD triangle. Simulataneous moves in the GBPUSD and the EURUSD indicate an underlying move in the dollar (which lately has correlated to DOW futures very well). Whereas large matching moves in the GBPUSD and the EURGBP indicate moves in the pound, oftentimes with little underlying dollar movement. Trading these underlying moves helps to ensure there's momentum for your trade.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
This looks great But why do you short/long one currency pair at one time? Why not both? Am I missing something here!!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
How do you normalize data ?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
If you absolutely must complicate things, subtract the difference between MACDs (1 for each pair). A 21/3 (or whatever) on both, subtract the differences between the 2 divergences, gives you the net divergence trend. Buy strength, sell weakness.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks for sharing this billbss, this looks great. Its hard to ignore results. I'm going to spend some time studying this.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Sorry for newbie question but how do you know if a pair makes a lower low or higher high ? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Why would you want to short both?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Look at this chart. The top pair made a lower Low at (2). It fell below the last low, which was (1) The bottom pair has basically the same shape as the top, but when the top made the lower low, the bottom pair didn't (4). It stayed above the last low (3).

--- 帖子 #34 ---
It's funny how the pairs alternate in doing this..

--- 帖子 #35 ---
So, do you always have 2 orders open. i.e. short/long long/short ?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I don't ever have two orders open.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
billbss how long do you usually keep them open? are you using a trailing s/l?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
For experimental purposes, I am using 2x ATR (14) for both the SL and TP. I stay in a trade until one of those is reached. No trailing stop. This is something that I'm sure can be improved upon. There might be a better way to exit, although i don't like trailing stops or taking partial profits.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
bill, best thread I've read in a looong time. THANKS!!!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Your welcome and thank YOU.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Rabid I do the same thing. I trade mostly the GBPUSD pair but watch the EURUSD and EURGBP pairs too to see what is moving my pair and how strong that movement will be. Supa C

--- 帖子 #42 ---
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics ) An example would be to calculate the mean, standard deviation and put each value into the following algorithm: double K; double twoPi = 2. * 3.14159265; K = (Val - Mean) / (ConfNZ * ( StdDev / twoPi )); return 1. / ( 1. + exp(-K) ); Dan I'll take a stab at it tonight and see if I see anything interesting.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Dear Bill, Thanks for the quick reply and thank you so much for sharing this method. It is very generous of you. I see from the charts you posted that you're using a one hour timeframe. Is this the timeframe you usually use/recommend? And, again, a question about highs/lows: is there a "best" high/low you use, i.e. a daily high/low, or do you use even intraday relative high/lows? And, just thought of a third question: once you have the divergence, what is the exact trigger, i.e. how much concerted price movement do you want from the pairs before you enter the trade? Thanks so much and sorry for any bother, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Bill In your example earlier you said the follwoing " We wait until both pairs turn down together. That is where the arrow is. We go short EUR/JPY. " My query is, if both pairs are going down (GBP/JPY &amp; EUR/JPY) then why don't we short both of them to double the profit since they are correlated rather than only shorting EUR/JPY?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Attach the following to GBPJPY and EURJPY. You may find it very interesting indeed.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
The higher the time frame, the clearer the divergences. I trade it with the 4H and 1H. If I'm trading the 1H, I choose the pairs with the 1H correlation chart. If I'm using 4H, I use the daily chart. I'm not sure this matters. You can probably use either chart for either time frame. If your two pairs look alike, they're good to trade. Use any swing highs or swing lows. They do not have to be the daily swing high or low, many times they will be, as the daily high and low change throughout the day. Just be sure the highs and lows, that are being looked at for divergence are synchronous between the two pairs. In other words, make sure the highs happen at the same time as well as the lows. The trigger is both pairs moving in the right direction at the same time- any amount is fine.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The idea is to buy the strongest pair and sell the weakest. On a long, buy the pair that did not make the new low. On the short, sell the pair that did not make the new high. I don't know how profitable it would be to trade them both. I have never tried it and never backtested it.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I'm still learning trading, and stops have been biting me for a while. I'm curious to know if you use this method for all (or even most) of your stops, or just this particular trade setup?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I either use this or some kind of price action stop.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi, Here is an arrows indicator.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Morning Bill, Greatly appreciate the time and effort you've extended to us. I've attached a screen shot of the 5m EURUSD_USDCHF divergence. Looking at the potential entries, would you recommend entry at the typical 123 break of S/R or would you enter at price movement highlighted by the red v-lines? Thanks much. Cliff

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Gee, you have good eyes. Negative divergences are very hard for me to see, without inverting one of those pairs. I finally saw the last one, I think. It isn't the 1-2-3 (it isn't a divergence), it's the smaller one to the right of the 1-2-3. Right? If so, I would have taken it at the red vertical line. The first one was a good divergence. I would have to invert to be able to figure out the entrance point. I THINK it would be one notch over to the right from your red lines.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Okay. Thanks for the feed back. It is becoming more clear now. Below are a couple of screen shots of trade I took on the 5m EURUSD and EURCHF pairs. I entered a little late according to setup rules. I entered sell at pink v-line on EURCHF. I set SL-TP for 20 pips which was about 2x ATR. Thanks again for this method. Cliff

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Billbss, Thank you for offering this strategy. Question, do you have any guidelines on the time between a divergence? Would you take a trade where the divergence occurred over a several day period on a 4H chart? For example, the GBP/JPY shows divergence with the USD/JPY between March 24th and the 31st. Thanks

--- 帖子 #55 ---
This is a good question, Toothman. I had not thought much about it myself. I'm glad you brought this up. Looking at the charts it may have some merit for the longer TF's. I look forward to Bill's thoughts and experience on this. Cliff

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This is absolutely more than just "interesting"...haven't come across anything like that for such long time i'm glad to have something to look over tonight when i get home... great job..

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hi which time frame we can use?????? billbss use 1H and 4H and cce use M5.... can we do it on 5m,15m?????

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Long term divergences are also valid. If you see one that spans several days, that's fine.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Any time frame.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Here is an indicator that will help you trade the EUR/USD - USD/CHF pairs. It inverts the USD/CHF. It isn't the Typical Price graph. It's a line graph of the Close, but it works fine. These pairs have a very high negative correlation. The screen shot is of the 1H chart. You can use it on any TF except 1M and Monthly. I marked (red vertical line) the divergences I saw. Out of that bunch, I only saw one or two that looked like losers. To trade these pairs, you have to think backwards, a little. The EUR/USD you trade as always. The USD/CHF you trade backwards. If it looks like a short on that pair, you buy. If it looks like a long trade- you sell. It is inverted on the graph. Screenshot, indicator and template to set it up. PS- If the vertical lines come up when you apply the template, go to "objects" and delete them, then resave the setup.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks for sharing this idea. I want to make sure I'm tracking so please bear with me while I confirm an example. Below is a 4 Hour chart of the EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY with both 1 period SMA's and the 14 period ATR. You would have seen the higher highs on both at the green arrows, and then the higher high on the GBP/JPY but not on the EUR/JPY at the red arrows. This would have had you looking for a short EUR/JPY entry as soon as they both turned downward and your target would be 36 pips because the ATR was at 18 and change. Is this correct? Thanks again for sharing this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #62 ---
That is correct. The only thing I would add is that the 1 period SMA, needs to be Typical Price.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
any consideration for trend direction, cos at times divergence trades are counter trend, and what if one just trades divergence straight away with some of these indies that pick divergence and convergence very well just an observation kos

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I wouldn't want to clutter it up with any other indicators or rules. I have looked at several divergence indicators, and have never seen one that I thought worked. Feel free to try these things. If they help you, that's great.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Dear Bill, Please forgive my obtuseness, but I don't understand your divergences marked by the red vertical lines on page 4, post #60---are there new highs in the one pair and not in the other; or new lows in the one pair and not in the other? I didn't see those. Thanks for any help. Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #66 ---
There are both. I'll zoom in on a couple to show you. This screenshot, is of the second and third red vertical line, shown on the chart in post #60. The one to the left, will be a long trade, the other is a short trade. I have placed orange trendlines, between the Lows and Highs in question. The red vertical lines, represent the entrance points.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Here is the last trade on EUR/USD - USD/CHF. The CHF made a new low- the EUR didn't. A long EUR/USD was taken at the red vertical line.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hey bill I can't get the chf to invert... using ibfx as well. Am I missing something? How are you getting both pair on the same chart or are you overlaying them on something else?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
This indicator and template does it. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=60

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I hacked an OverlayChart indicator I had that displayed any sub pair so it displays as a line graph instead of a candle graph. I've also added an 'offset' variable that makes it easier to view the two symbols on the chart. Code looks ugly but I threw it together quickly. It works fine. Hope it helps some people. Lux

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thank you, Bill. Well-explained. Most appreciated. Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Wow. Great thinking on the divergence idea, Bill! Thanks for the thread! I'll bet that there will be many good contributions to the thread - I'm looking forward to more from Rabid and Pipsqueak, if they are so inclined. Nudge, nudge!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thank you very much. That looks good.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
first of all congrats this divergence method works awesome 1) luxinterior the indi is not working on ibfx what i must do so that it works can u tell that thanks 2)To the author i have used all_usd_pair it will be easy to make the stats and check it for least 200 trades i will do that if u will let us know how to increase the period of the indicator so that we can test is for some large no of trades.Currently on 5 min tf i can check till 27th march.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
1. Remove the "m" at the end of USDCHF on the indicator pop up. I believe that's for a mini account. 2. On the all_usd indicator, increase the "line centre" number and it will go farther back.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thanks bill for this great method it works awesome and congrats to u as not many people can even think of trading like this no indies only line graph awesome thats how things are done bill although there is no doubt that this method is wonderfull i am in forex for 3 years and with my exp i will rate this method 5 star if u can add a logic behind why it happens than it will be great because belief + logic make things great also bill how can we increase the period of data so that we can make the stats and check large no of trades.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thank you for the kind words. The logic is the same as any divergence method. Usually the price is compared to an indicator (stoch., MACD, RSI), which should, theoretically mimic price. When they deviate, it's considered a divergence and the trade is placed. The only difference in this case, is that price is compared to the price of another pair. Because of the high correlation, the two prices should mimic each other. When they deviate, it is a divergence. On the All_USD indicator, increasing the "line_centre" parameter will place the two pairs on the same chart as far back as you want.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I don't know if the start points can be changed on Luxinterior's indicator. Perhaps he will see this and respond.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
bill i increased line centre to 1000 from 400 (default) price was coming from 27th march in 400 and after increasing it to 1000 price line came from 31st march then on decreasing the line centre from 400 to 5 the price came from 25th march but line got closed up. is there any way out by which i can atleast see the two line together for least 6 months on 5 min tf my object is to find the stats for least 200 trades and for that i will require this. thanks bill.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I can't answer that. When I increase mine to 1000, it goes back to Jan. 27. I'm not an indicator man. I just use them. Maybe a programmer can help.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Sorry bill that is what I meant. I used that template and ALL USD pair, but it still doesn't work. I put it on usd/chf 1hr and the line chart shows like yours but the chf isn't inverted. It has the red vertical lines that you added, but no eurusd line. I put it on eur/usd 1hr and the red lines are there and your prices for other pairs, but no inverted chf line. Anyway, the indicator LUX posted works perfectly so never mind really. I just find it wierd that it works for you and not for me and we both have ibfx..

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Here is a screenshot of the chf pair. Look under the USDCHF H1 words... maybe that is causing a problem. http://i40.tinypic.com/jr9u9e.gif

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I see the problem. You have a mini account. The pair symbols end in "m". The indicator isn't defaulted that way. It's calling for USDCHF not USDCHFm.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
oops sorry I have little money great thanks.. fixed.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
So here is the eur and eurchf 1hr charts... Am I seeing that that eurusd is making a new high now while eurchf is not? Therefore according to your rules we would sell eurchf? I guess assuming today doesn't gap or anything I mean. http://i42.tinypic.com/2urqpti.gif

--- 帖子 #86 ---
You would sell the red line. I wouldn't do it on a Sunday open. There are too many factors involved, that are not present on a continuous chart.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Bill is there a horizontal price difference between blue and brown line when we use it on 5 min tf .it seems on chart that blue line follows the brown line after the lag of 15 min on 5 min tf there is no such lag on 1 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I'm not sure I understand. There can be a dip or a hump in price on a 15M tf. that doesn't show on the 1H, if that is what you mean.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Bill, nice method here. I added a bit of code that accounts for any extention on the end of a currency.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
bill with the indi all_usd_pair on 5 min time frame 1)brown line indicates price for eur usd 2)blue line indicates price for ? and when we change the time frame lets say we make it to 1 hr then brown indicates eur usd price and blue indicates ?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Blue indicates USDCHF on all time frames. Actually you can change the colors up, but that's the way I delivered the template.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Great system, thanks for posting. Just curious if anyone would know if the gap in pips between the two currencies/lines could be displayed by the indicator, maybe shown in the upper right hand corner???? thanks

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I'm sure it could, but it wouldn't mean anything. The separation of the two pairs depends on the starting point of the second pair. It's an illusion. They even trade places on different time frames.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hey bill u rocks and ur method rocks collecting stats and they seems to be outstanding thanks for sharing bill. 1 Ques:bill for how much time are u trading or observing or have tested this method. 2 Ques : bill which time frame and pair u like the most for divergence trading with eur usd.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
hi bill what is 14 ATR x 2? how many pips is that?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I've been observing it for several years. I haven't really tested it. I usually fan through the TFs until I see divergence.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
It changes with each bar. ATR= Average True Range. It is a standard MT4 indicator.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I've looked at the overlay indicators, over the weekend and the one by luxinterior is by far the best...IMO It's much better than the one I posted. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&amp;postcount=70

--- 帖子 #100 ---
BILL 1)Whats the best pair u have noticed which works best on small time frame like 5min , 15 min with eur usd with ur pair divergence method. 2)also which pair do u prefer trading and which time frame on it. thanks

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Here's an article, that may be of interest(?), on EUR/USD-USD/CHF correlation: http://www.investopedia.com/articles...lationship.asp Has basic correlation theory explanations that I found helpful. I'm actually looking for info on which pairs tend to be dominant . Just by observing I'd say, of the base pairs, it's EUR/USD. Just in general. The above article does mention this in the discussion on using correlations intra-day. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Good article. Thanks

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I like trading either EUR/JPY - GBP/JPY or EUR/USD- USD/CHF The spread is so high on G/J, I only take trades that happen on E/J. Again- tf doesn't matter. I usually fan through to see what's setting up.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Greetings Bill! So this is what you've been working on! I just stumbled across your posting and I KNEW it had to be great, otherwise you wouldn't bother with it. Thanks for sharing with the rest of us...I will be immersing myself in your strategy over the next few days, and I fully expect to report back successful trading!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Today's trades on EUR/USD- USD/CHF and EUR/JPY- GBP/JPY. The first EURO-CHF trade lost 5 pips. All the others made profit.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Bill, Are you still trading the 4hr tf? If so, can you please post your running results?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I trade 4H if I see something setting up on it. I go through the different time frames until I see a set up. I haven't kept track of running results. I don't have a lot of time with it and trade it sporadically. If you have the charts set up, it's easy to go back and see the trades.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
hi bill is there any EA that you use for this method or prefer???????.... saly

--- 帖子 #109 ---
No. I don't think an EA could trade this.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi BB Forgive me if this sounds dumb but I've been looking at your screen shots and trying do discern a methodology, I'm sure there is one, I just can't see it Hopefully by writing out my observations in this post it'll become clearer to me. Here' goes nothing... I'm trying to grasp why you decide to enter in one direction or the other. Take for example your EUR/USD chart. To me it looks like, on the first trade, you see divergence on the EURUSD (green) with LL while the USDCHF (white) shows a HL. Now your arrow shows up on the white so I'm assuming (?) you went LONG on the USDCHF. Trade 2, similarly, you notice that EURUSD (green) makes a LH while USDCHF (white) makes a HH, so you go SHORT USDCHF (?). Trade 3: You see that EURUSD (green) is making HL while USDCHF (white) is making LL so you decide to go LONG USDCHF Hopefully I got that bit right. Now from what I've just written and, hopefully, what I'm observing, I can form these rules. if EURUSD is making LL and USDCHF is making HL = LONG USDCHF - could you not SHORT EURUSD? if EURUSD is making LH and USDCHF is making HH = SHORT USDCHF - could you not LONG EURUSD? if EURUSD is making HL and USDCHF is making LL = LONG USDCHF - could you not SHORT EURUSD? So I guess the only one missing is EURUSD HH and USDCHF LH would mean SHORT USDCHF/LONG EURUSD?? As I said I don't mean to sound dumb but being a somewhat 'literal' person who likes things in definable terminology (programmer!) I was having trouble 'visualizing' the methodology. Let me know how I did and feel free to correct, chastise or ridicule me as you wish Thanks Lux CORRECTION - Looking at it again and bearing in mind you're mirroring, the method would be more like this? EURUSD LL and USDCHF HL = LONG EURUSD EURUSD LH and USDCHF HH = SHORT EURUSD EURUSD HL and USDCHF LL = LONG EURUSD EURUSD HH and USDCHF LH = SHORT EURUSD Would it be the same for positively correlated pairs too?

You are correct. That is what the arrows indicate, BUT the USD/CHF is inverted on the chart (mirrored). Anytime the chart shows going LONG on USD/CHF, in reality you will go short. So the first trade was a short on U/C. The confusion on this one is my fault. I should have placed the arrow next to E/U, not U/C. U/C had made a HH, E/U had made a LH. There fore E/U is the weaker. This trade was a short on E/U. Since E/U is making a HL and U/C is making a LL, E/U is stronger. This trade was a LONG on E/U. (E/U = LL and U/C = HL) = LONG U/C You are correct, BUT U/C is always traded in the reverse of what it appears. Therefore that trade is actually SHORT U/C. E/U cannot be shorted. If we're looking at lows, we're always looking at a LONG setup. If EURUSD is making LH and USDCHF is making HH = SHORT E/U. Since E/U is the LH, it is weaker. We would short it. We wouldn't trade long, because we are looking at a divergence of Highs. This is always a short setup. if EURUSD is making HL and USDCHF is making LL = LONG E/U. Since EU is higher (HL), it is stronger. We would go LONG E/U. We would trade short on this setup, because we are looking at a divergence of LOWS. You are correct, except we would not go LONG E/U. We always trade only one pair. We don't hedge them. Also remember that if the chart indicates a SHORT U/C (which the above does) we actually go LONG and vice versa . This is because we are looking at the U/C inverted on the chart. You don't sound dumb, at all. I'm glad you asked the questions and I hope I did them justice. I wouldn't chastise or ridicule you for the world. I appreciate your indicator too much I'm joking, I wouldn't anyway, those were good questions. Let me know if my explanation wasn't clear enough. Thanks Lux CORRECTION - Looking at it again and bearing in mind you're mirroring, the method would be more like this? No, this would be LONG USDCHF. U/C is the HL, therefore it is stronger, therefore a LONG U/C. BUT U/C is always traded the reverse of what the chart shows. This trade would actually be a SHORT U/C. Correct. Correct. No. SHORT U/C. It's lower, therefore weaker. BUT SHORT U/C, actually means what? It means LONG U/C. Positively correlated pairs follow the same rules, but since neither pair is mirrored, a LONG means a LONG and a SHORT means a SHORT. Think of it as trading W and M formations.__ A "W" formation is two lows, side by side. It looks like a letter W. Both pairs make their W. We compare them. Pair A). On this pair the second valley of the W is lower than the first valley. Pair B). On this pair, the second valley of the W is higher than its first valley. We're comparing LOWS, so we will be going long. B (above) is higher. It is the strongest of the two pairs. We will go LONG on B. The M formation, is two peaks, side by side. It looks like a letter M. Pair A) On this pair, the second peak of its M is higher than the first peak. Pair B) On this pair, the second peak of its M is lower than the first peak. We're comparing Highs, therefore we will be going short. Which pair will we short? We will short Pair B, because its second peak is Lower, therefore it is the weaker pair.

Thanks for that VERY thorough reply! I'm going to read it through a few times and tattoo it on my brain! Lux PS: Nice sig you got there Here's my updated 'Cliff Notes'... When comparing POSITEVLY correlated pairs the following is true. When comparing LOWS we will ONLY be going LONG. We will LONG the pair with the HIGHEST LOW as it is the STRONGEST pair. When comparing HIGHS we will ONLY be going SHORT. We will SHORT the pair with the LOWEST HIGH as it is the WEAKEST pair. When comparing NEGATIVELY correlated pairs (e.g. EURUSD &amp; USDCHF) the rules above apply BUT the key point to remember is that IF the WEAK/STRONG pair is the NEGATIVELY CORRELATED pair (e.g. USDCHF) then the signal is REVERSED. (e.g. If we get a LONG signal on USDCHF we actually trade a SHORT on USDCHF).

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Oh GEE! I didn't mean to cop your sig. I don't know how that happened- Sorry I'll fix it.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Here are the two trades on E/U - U/C since my last screenshot. The first yellow arrow on the first chart, looks like a trade but it's not. The second peaks do not line up. The first trade took profit. The second trade is still in progress. It is in profit.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Perfect!!! You've got it.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
There have also been two more trades on EURJPY - GBPJPY since yesterday. Both were winning trades. I'll post the charts in a few hours. I need to get some sleep.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Bill, I like the system very much, but my observations are reversed. Maybe there's a middle ground somewhere? Your idea is to identify the UNDER performer and go with that pair. But if it's already under performing, why are we so sure it will continue it's current trend? After all, isn't that pair the weakest of the 2 at that moment? Rather, I feel we should go with the stronger of the 2: The pair which is showing the greater activity, hence better movement over all. I see it like the weaker pair is acting somewhat as an anchor that slows the faster pair down, causing it (the faster side) to "snap back" into the correct correlation. Why would the weaker pair snap back? It already shows sign of slowing, right? It could be that the weaker pair is transitioning to a range at that moment -- not a good time to rely on it. So shouldn't the faster &amp; stronger pair be the one we bet on?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I'm not opposed to that. It would have to be tested to see if it's more profitable. The way it is, looks like it hits about 80%. That would be hard to top, but I'm all for it, if we can.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I also agree that what you have highlighted is profitable. I only caution against using as our benchmark a pair that is already showing signs of slowing before we even get in. Especially when right next door is a pair moving much faster and with greater volatility. I'm open for correction.....

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I'm not sure I understand you. We buy the pair which made the higher low. The pair we are buying has already exhibited upward pressure, compared to the other pair. We sell the pair which has made a lower high, compared to the other pair. The pair we are selling has exhibited more downward pressure, compared to the other pair.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
As you already know, excellent system! In reviewing example trades over the past month on 4H and 1H I've notes a few things: The pair that reaches a lower high or a higher low, the "weak" pair, often goes farther in price like the other pair but has begun to snap back by the time the bar closes. Bill's using of Typical price puts more weight on the final close price so the 1 SMA looks weaker but can be actually moving more and faster. But the 1 SMA makes it much easier to see! I'm seeing that a lot of the "weak" pairs are moving past fib lines then snapping back to close right on a fib, further evidence of resistance and imminent reversal. I zoomed in on 5M and found very trendy, very easy-to-follow price action without spiky uncertainty during the 1-4 hours after the signal. Excellent, excellent trading conditions with a strong bias toward the eventual take profit targets based on 1H or 4H. Just only maybe take trades in the direction of the trend. And quite a few times the very first 5M bar right after the 1H closed was a trade signal with my other system and the price took off from there. I'm very excited to use this system like a weather predictor for good/bad conditions to know good times to trade, making long-term trades according to the rules and short-term trades during the same conditions.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Just a quick question for luxinterior. The indicator you modified draws a typical line right? not a line based on close. So if we are following BillBss' method, we should also draw a MA1simple typical for the base chart that the indicator is on.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
HI SMJ Always a pleasure to see you! Yes it draws the typical price (HLC/3). Thanks Lux

--- 帖子 #124 ---
bill, i was testing your pair divergence system and trying to find the best possible pattern in divergence in eurusd and usd chf a)I have seen a pattern with 90% success rate keeping R.R 2 when trading against the trend and RR 3 when trading in favour of trend using your divergence in m5 tf. but the thing is i cant post it till its tested for least 200 trades for that i need a indi using which i can see both eur usd and inverted usd chf data back to atleast 6 months back on 5 min tf. Special programmer request If there are any programmer here pls make it possible so that we can use this indi for overlaping inverted chf ove eur uSd for longer period of 6 months in 5 min tf. Teamwork required Lets move like a team bill gave the method its our work to improve it and test is as much we can and programmers must help to make indi so we can backtest it for least 200 trades.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks for your help. Lux can correct me, if I'm wrong, but his indicator, will populate as far back as you want. Shift the screen back and wait a few seconds and you'll get the line graph. I think it needs tick data to do that. On a weeekend, you'll have to click on and off of another time frame to make it work. For instance, drag the chart back, click on 15M then back to 5M. See if it doesn't work. If you want, go ahead and give us the patterns, and I'll help you test. If it turns out not to work, no problem.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Bill which ever messenger u uses actively tell me the id man we can talk more actively their. Trading concept. Time frame 5 min. pair eurusd usdchf. TRADES WILL BE DONE ONLY IN EUR USD BECAUSE OF LOW SPREAD AND GOOD TRENDING HABBIT AND LESS VOLATALITY AND MORE LIQUIDITY. ENTRY. When ever hill or valley is formed mark its top and bottom If there is hidden or classical divergence we will trade both Time difference between two diverging points will be more than &gt;110 min (in order to catch good moves and leave small moves) once conditions are formed let the price move in our direction and retrace to 5 points to close against the moving directions if this peak formed is broken in the next move then we trade it. SL SL is below the peak formed its not more than 10-15 points but its highly effective Booking let the price move in our direction we will exit if we see opposite divergence builing up else we will close the trade once the retracement peaks are broken in the way. average winners are 2 time more profitable than a loss if against the trend and around 3 times more proftable if in favour of trend. bill atleast we must test 200 trades i am very confident that we can have over 90% success system with precise entry and exits and small sl and good risk reward and can make rules more precise and easy once a way is found to backtest this for long period . I Uses ibfx just find a way bill by which we can overlay line chart for 6 months. credit goes to bill and his system.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
That sounds very good. I think I understand it. I don't have a messenger. I also have an abscessed tooth. My face is all swollen and I can barely talk. I checked luxinterior's indicator, and it will go back as far as you want it to, a screen full at a time. You can take it back six moths. Here's the post he posted in on: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&amp;postcount=70 Thanks for all your help. I'll look at this.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi bill, Can u tell me exact way how u get the back data overlaping in m5 TF for past 6 month as using overlay indi on ibfx i am able to get it till 14.35 april 9. and using ur indi (all usd pair ) i get that from 27th march. bill time frame is m5 for which we want overlaying for past few months on h1 its available from 24th dec but the current testing is on m5. i am confident u will get the solution and let me know about it. If ur able to get it do let me know bill.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hope you feel better soon, Bill!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
While you have the chart displayed, as you had it above, click on the 15M TF, then click back to 5M. The overlay will appear and fill the chart, you are displaying. Then drag it back another screenfull and do it again. You can go back as far as you have 5M data on EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Bill, Are you in pain? You can sip ice cold water and hold it against the infected tooth and that will help to re leave the inflammation which is causing the pain. I hope you can get an emergency dentist appointment. If you can take Ibufrofen, that will help reduce inflammation. Tylenol won't do much, because it does not reduce inflammation it is only an analgesic. Take care and get feeling better.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi Scott, I'm not in pain, now. My lips and jaw are real swollen. I went to a dentist Thursday. He said it was too swollen and infected to work on. He put me on antibiotics and I'm supposed to go back Wednesday. He also gave me some hydrocodein (sp?) for the pain. It has worked. He told me to take Advil, which I think is ibuprofen. Thanks for the advice. I'll try the cold water, too. It sure can't hurt.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Force Devotee, If it is not too much trouble and when you get some time, could you post an example of this setup. I think I get it, I just want to be sure. regards, Scott

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Bill i tried doing what u said it worked but doing that way also it do not go beyond 24th april. anyways testing the method from 24th march to april 10 there are 12 trades 11 wins 1 loss must test atleast 200 trades bill if u get the chart on m5 tf beyond 24th april pls post a pic of it .

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I can't explain it. I can shift mine back as far as I want to. I've done it. It should be limited only by the amount of E/U and U/C 5 minute data your MT4 has. Maybe Lux will see this and offer some advice. Can you post a screenshot of one of your trades?

guys currently i am testing it for longer term once 200 trades are done i will go for 1000 trades in different market condition. here is the screen shot of one of the trade divergence + retracement(+5) + break of retracement in one go = entry sl sl close above 1.3328 (5 pips)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
bill, can you please guide on finding the valid hills and valleys? I seem to have problems with identifying them. Is there a trick to it ir what? thank you so much

--- 帖子 #142 ---
The easiest way is to wait until the hills and valleys line up perfectly on each pair. For instance, a hill on each pair happening at the same time, a valley happening at the same time, then another hill happening at the same time. Forget the ones that have squiggles in the middle. Just take the ones that are clear and unmistakable. Once you can do that, without any problems, you will learn what kind of deviations are acceptable and profitable. There is no substitute for actual chart time, looking at this stuff.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
... you would not have entered this trade since one pair was leading the other a little bit, and the formations were a little offset from each other? http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1239575649 By the way, thanks for the time, effort, and insight.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Bill as u have observed the pair divergence a lot longer than any one of us so which pair u recommend for better results. eurusd -usdchf eurjpy -gbpjpy for a short tife frame of 5 min and also for long tf of 1hr /4hr. your experience worth a million for all of us.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
It's not so much a matter of experience, as it is which pairs are correlated. That varies over time. I would go here: http://www.mataf.net/en/tools/correlation-table Pick out the highest correlated pairs (right now there are several), with the lowest spreads . The Hourly chart shows the most recent correlation. The Daily is a longer term view. I think I would use the 1H correlation chart, rather than the Daily, as I said in my first post. Despite the correlation charts, the best test is to put the pairs up on a chart and look at them. If they're all over the screen, you don't want to trade them right now. From experience, the EUR/USD - USD/CHF is the most consistent, in correlation. For that reason, it is best to backtest. In short- backtest the E/U - U/C Trade the highest correlated pairs from the 1H chart. You can stick to trading only, E/U - U/C, if you want. On 15M you'll get two or three good setups a day, on average.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
You're right. By the standard I posted, that wouldn't have been a trade. I was answering a post which wanted help in identifying the divergences. Requiring them to be exactly in sync, gets rid of many "ifs and maybes" and makes it less confusing. ForceDevotee, is testing a set up that he's found accurate and was showing us an example. It doesn't follow the standard I set, but it may prove better.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
One trade, so far, today on EUR/USD - USD/CHF. It was a winner. Short USD/CHF @ 06:15 GMT. (Remember, it's inverted on the chart)

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Great technique Billbss!...Thanks. My FxPro /Alpari UK Metatrader platform didn't show the Eur/Usd green 15min. line making a new low like yours. I may need to use an Interbank feed like yours. Do you mind saying if that's a live or demo feed? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #149 ---
It's a demo feed. I don't think it will matter. I had this one and you didn't. You may have the next one, and I won't. Be sure the EUR/USD line is a Simple MA- 1 period- typical price.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Okay - thanks.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Bill was this a divergence? Took a mini trade on it, just to learn with. EDIT: updated the Screen shot for better clarity. Turns out this is not a valid Divergence, because there is no Peak on the EURJPY just a steady move up. See the post just after this one.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Technically no. There was no middle peak on the EUR/JPY. It rose and stayed flat.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Dang, back to the study. LOL I think I 'll let my .10 per pip play out though just because it is in the market. I see what you mean now, thanks for the lesson.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
The last trade I can see on those pairs, was a GBP/JPY short at the close of the 0600 15M candle on Friday. It went to profit. I may have overlooked one, but I looked pretty close.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
So you are taking trades on GBPJPY? I thought I read that you are only taking the EURJPY, because of the spread. Maybe I misread that.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I'm not taking trades on GBP/JPY because of the spread. Correct. I pay 9 pips and the SL is usually around 40. That's to high a % to pay. I wouldn't have traded it, but there was a setup to trade it at 0615 on Friday. I only mentioned it, so you could look back at it.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Oh, ok thanks bill

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here's a trade on EUR/JPY - GBP/JPY. Short the E/J @ 133.75 SL &amp; TP = 32 PIPS Entry at 20:45 GMT Still active

This one from luxinterior.

Hello Billbss, very interesting thread just finished reading twice, thanks for sharing. do have a question, my IBFX demo chart looks like Poocher's in post 148 and you responded to Poocher, saying: in the OverlayChartLine indicator I do not see any Inputs that refer to Moving Averages. is there some further step one needs to take with the OverlayChartLine indicator? if so, please....how exactly is one to "be sure" ...is there something in the MT4 platform to change? I thought when I switched my chart from the default bar chart to a line chart the lines were representing price...? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks for share, billbss. Thats amazing. In attachments backtest on GY H4 vs EY H4 from 1st Jan to last friday. Next post will be results fr EY H4 vs GY H4 on same period.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Works on both pairs in the same time. Here is EY 4H. GY much better.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
could you test it on 15M ???? i think results better on usd/chf and eur/usd if you back testing them too

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Ok. I'll do it on EU vs UC on 15M.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
If you haven't placed a MA on your chart then the green line is a line graph of the Close. Place a Simple MA- 1 period, Typical Price on the chart. It will look almost like the green line does now, with very small differences. Then -right click the chart- Properties- Colors. Change the "Line Graph" color to "None". That will leave the MA.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Those look great! Thanks for testing them.

Hi Bill, Great thread, thanks a lot for sharing your ideas. Quick ? - have you tried trading the other pair of the two, i.e. the one which DOES make HH or LL, as it seems it is that pair which is overbought/oversold?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
SM, what are those crosses on your chart?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Just a quick indi I wrote to make a cross at the close price of the chart currency

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Results were successful. reached the profit target of 2 x atr . Stop loss not hit.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Sounds useful, Scott, would you mind posting it here please?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Sure, but all it does is put the close price on the chart.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks a lot, Scott!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
MyxoMop, did you do the tests with Bill's original exit and SL rules based on ATR?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Went short on the USDCHF, (reverse the long) on the first vertical line. Then closed it when EURUSD went short on second vertical line. First was a few pips profit and second was successful at 2 x atr Bill, Am I supposed to close the existing trade if another opposite trade presents it self? I think it would be counter productive to have opposite trades running.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yeah, I'd close on a counter trade. Although in this case, the first U/C short is still alive and looks like it may go on to make profit, I think that's rare.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
thanks Billbss for explanation! is the default red line in the Indicator, for the second pair, a moving average or price? (I know you did not write the code) on today's EURJPY and GBPJPY 15m IBFX around between 9:45 and 12:00 chart time....would you say the peaks and valleys do not line up for a EURJPY Short trade? or is it close enough for a valid set up?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Bill Hanover has just posted this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=163158 The Recent Strength indicator plots the relative strengths of each currency against each other, on any timeframe(s) that you choose. I think it would be useful for your Pair Divergence Method.. Hope this helps C

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hello MyxoMop, did you write an Expert Advisor for Billbss's system to produce the backtest?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
It's an average. On my chart, they didn't line up enough for a trade. A good rule of thumb is- if you're in doubt, don't trade it. The ones we're looking for will be clear and unmistakable. Also, if you see what is a near trade, but it doesn't perfectly line up- go to a higher time frame. You may have it there, too. It may be clean.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Here's the first loss, I've seen in a while. Long on EUR/JPY- Hit the SL.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
As with any method, trading in a context of the current trend helps (A LOT). Hence, if you are trading M15, taking just those trades which are in line with H1 trend would improve results. Unless the market is ranging, of course...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Bill, it could be a good idea to keep an eye on the price itself too (as well a couple of MAs). As I mentioned above, taking just the trades with the current trend (H1 if you are trading M15) as well as avoiding (or being aware of) consolidation periods could help avoid bad trades (but not eliminate 100%).

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Have you tested taking only trades in line with the H1 trend? What were your results? How do you identify the H1 trend?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I appreciate your suggestion, but I can't agree. It has been my experience that the more filters and indicators used, the weaker the system becomes until it ceases to exist. This is hitting around 80%. I have not done a thoroughly documented backtest, but I'ts my observation that it's very close to 80- maybe more. I think this is a case of - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Sorry, Bill, I should have been more clear. Your method - in my view - is very good for identifying a "brewing" momentum (somewhat like a spring/coil being squeezed) as well as the direction of that new momentum. Price (candlesticks and their patterns) helps me to fine-tune the entry point, on a lower TF. E.g. if I see divergence on H1, zooming into M15 help me to pinpoint where I open a position. MAs help me to see the underlying/current trend. I use MAs in two ways: (a) price above/below SMA50; and (b) relationship between MAs 13, 21 and 62 (you can use any similar fast, medium and slow MAs). I am not trying to change or improve your system; simply a thought how else it can be used.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
We had two more trades on the EUR/USD - USD/CHF. Both were shorts on EUR/USD. The are still active and in profit, so far.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hello there Mr.Bill Sir, Firstly, congratulations on the method and thankyou for sharing, looks like it is on to something. Secondly, my word it took me a while to get that chart overlay indicator working ! lol I will be forward testing this on demo and I will report any insights etc I have. Thirdly, Am I doing it right ? (See chart) And lastly, why did you enter where you did on the EURUSD trade ? You deem to be leaving it a while after the set up occurs to enter, any particular reason ? EDIT - Attached chart. Regards, Jig

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Bill, I saw these also. Thanks for a great idea. I am getting the hang of it now. these both were successfull

--- 帖子 #197 ---
You're doing it right, according to the chart you posted. The red vertical lines on my chart showed the entrances. They were at the point where both pairs turned down. If they had been longs, the entrance would have been at the point when both pairs turned up.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Your welcome. I hope you make a bunch of pips with it.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
So if my current price that i want to enter is difference from the atr 14 by 30 pips apart. I double it to 60 pips apart. is that the meaning of 2 x atr 14

--- 帖子 #200 ---
No. There is no relationship between price and ATR. At the time you enter, check the ATR 14. It shows the average range (H-L) of the last 14 bars. Double it. That is your SL and TP. The overlay indicator, prints the 2 x ATRs for both pairs in the bottom right of the chart.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Bill, When you say, "turned up", or "turned down", do you mean to enter as soon as the line turns up, or do you mean when the underlying candle has closed, and the turned up line or turned down line cannot repaint? Thanks

--- 帖子 #202 ---
On the close. Trade on closed signals only.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
There's a long setting up for USD/CHF, if it still looks this way at 02:45 GMT.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
This trade was a winner.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
That's what (roughly) I had in mind, Bill. It was a signal for Short, yet if you look at the picture "behind the scenes", going short at that point was not ideal. On the other hand, with a good SL in place (as per your ATRx2 rule), the trend would eventually work out. But waiting for over 10 bars for the trade to work could be not to everybody's taste...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
It wasn't a signal for a short. The USD/CHF is inverted on the overlay chart. It was a signal for long U/CHF. The trade made it's profit.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Sorry, Bill, forgot about that UF was mirrored. Thank you for the correction. P.S. How did you know it was UF?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Bill, Do you trade pair divergence which occured between two adjacent bars, as on the enclosed example? MANY THANKS!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Bill, have a look at the 15Min today if you would ever be so kind. Questions on charts.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Bill, Thank you for sharing this great system. I do have a question, up to how many bars/candles back do you look for the divergences to occur? If on a 15 minute time frame, is it OK to compare the initial divergence points up to 2 to 3 hours back or more, or does it need to be a closer period of time? Is there a maximum number of previous bars you consider to be too far back to take a trade? Thanks for your help!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi 007, I asked Billbss this question, so I'll share his answer to me, and try to save him a post (unless I've got it wrong, of course, in which case, Billbss will no doubt correct me). No, this is not a trade. The peaks/valleys must occur on the same bar. If they are a bar late, the system waits for the next set up. Hope this helps. VBro

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Jigsaw, I've asked Billbss pretty thoroughly about the rules, so I'll take a crack at sharing what I've learned from him (and I trust Billbss will correct me if I'm wrong). 1.) As I understand it, the example you have posted is not a proper set up, no trade here. The reason: Peak #1 on Euro occurs @ 7:15 bar, while peak #1 on Swissy occurs @ 7:30 bar. The peaks must occur on the same bar for Billbss' system to trigger a trade. 2.) If the peaks/valleys do occur on the same bars, then the following bar must signal entry on both pairs at the same time. So, if the second peak occurs at 7:30 bar (must be on both pairs), then the 7:45 bar must tick down (again, must be on both pairs) in order to trigger a trade. If this does not happen, the system rules do not allow a trade, and you must wait for the next set up. Hope this helps, VBro

--- 帖子 #213 ---
It does, a lot. Thankyou

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thank you Vbro, you gave good answers. I've been slaving over my tax returns. I haven't had much time for this.

Just took a set up on the USDCHF on IBFX and noticed that my SL looked further than it should be (I have a script to set it automatically). So I checked the spread and it was 8 pips!!! I'm looking at it now and have seen it go up to 9 and down to 7. Is this a new thing for IBFX? There's no news and it's not a spike. It's been sitting there for the past 15 mins I've been watching it. Lux INSTANT UPDATE: Wouldn't you know it! As soon as I finished typing I checked again and it's fallen to 5 then 4. I'm going to have to watch these guys or maybe think about changing brokers.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I've noticed IBFX doing that. I've seen GBP/JPY as high as 20 pips. I have no idea why.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I missed that one, I hope you were able to manage it well. The screenshot enclosed for the interested ones. Thanks for bringing up this method bill and thanks to lux for the indi!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
billbss, Although I have my own method of trading, I am finding this method to be habit forming. I have followed this thread until today &amp; have the method up &amp; running on E/$ &amp; USD/CHF on the 15M tf @ this time &amp; it almost seems to good to be true how well it catches the moves. It seems the point to watch for is when both lines turn on the same candle......is that correct? Over the next week I'll keep this up &amp; running taking some demo trades as I go &amp; just might give this a try in the live mode. Have you thought about maybe writing a pdf for how you trade this? I hope that is not asking too much, but everything laid out in pdf format would be nice. What do you see, if any the negatives to this method? Are you using the 15M tf to enter trades from? What other pairs would you advise to trade? Thanks for sharing what really seem to be a great method. _____________________________

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I have thought about rewriting the first post. I've not only learned a few things since then, but I've learned what was not understood, the first time around and believe I can improve on it. pdf? I don't have the super duper writable version of Acrobat that will let me write- only read. I have MSWORD, though. I'll redo post #1 and well see what else is needed. Right now, I don't see any real negatives. There is not enough action to please a lot of people. I do not believe it can be automated. It has to be looked at constantly. Other than that, I don't know of any negatives. I am now, almost exclusively. Good question. E/U - U/C is dynamite. I'm less enthusiastic about E/J - G/J. Here's what I want to do this weekend: Take all pair combos from the 1H correlation chart, which show &gt;80%. Depending on how many there are, I may cut it off at 85%. Manually backtest them for at least a month. That should give 40 or so trades each. I think that will tell us which pairs are worth trading. Your welcome.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
billbss, Tks for your response. I really don't see any negatives to this method either, but some may find the lack of action as a negative. I too am using only the 15M tf. It will be interesting to see what pairs you come up with over the weekend. Not a good one for automation, but still a great method. If you would just repost everything about this method &amp; what you have learned since its inception that would be great. All the rules, do's &amp; don't in one post would do it. Tks again for sharing &amp; any updates forthcoming. ______________________________

Three winning trades today on EUR/USD-USD/CHF. No losers. 1. Long U/C 2. Long E/U 3. Short U/C

--- 帖子 #222 ---
hi bill for overlayer indicator did i need set mirroring to false for gbpjpy &amp; eurjpy? thanks

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Those are two positively correlated pairs so the answer is no. Only set mirroring to true for negatively correlated paris like EURUSD/USDCHF Lux

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Billbss. Thank you very much for sharing your system. If you want to make a pdf you can write a document in MSWord or WordPad or whatever you want and then use a free software like CutePDF, PrimoPDF and other to make it in to a pdf file. If you google those names or "free pdf writer" or "free pdf creator" or something like that you will find some good ones. I am not asking you or telling you to do it, this is just for information. You have already done more than enough when sharing your system i think. If you have a text (like one of the posts here or a doc) you want made in to a pdf just say so and some of us others will do it. No problem. Again thank you. Friendly regards. Arctic4x

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Thanks, VBro!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Bill, thank you very much for your efforts! PDF - PM me, I can either turn your Word file into PDF or send you a free PDF maker. Quick question: when one pair makes HH and other one doesn't, do you always trade the latter? Could sometimes the "HH" pair be a better choice? Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Lux, thanks a lot for your indi!! IBFX - several people complained about that. Try Oanda , many traders at FF use it.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
No always take the weaker pair to sell (the one that didn't make the HH). Always buy the stronger pair (the one didn't make the LL). I've verified this with a lot of chart time.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
If you want to watch also futures, i would recommend sp500 and nasdaq, bund and schatz, gold and silver, they are really interested in M15. In forex I keep eye on eur/usd and usd/chf, eur/gbp and gbp/chf (M15). Thanks billbss for your method, it's fascinating!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
hey BillBss Put this indicator on your chart and set ATR to 14 multyplier 2 In the top left of your chart you will see a figure in pips which is your ATR14 x 2 on the current candle Open the data Window and use a cross hair on ANY candle and it will show you the ATR of 14 x 2 on that candle hope it helps Paulus

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I have the Overlay ind in my indicator folder on FXdd. I've tried to place on chart from navigator on M15 chart and also H4 chart. I'v tried changing color (they are all defaulted to black on color tab). I've unloaded and reloaded, still no lines or text on chart. Help Paul. I've seen loading EAs and indicators for years so should know how! P.S. do you load it twice to get two lines on chart? It is defaulted to mirror on USD/CHF, do I change to false if not USD/CHF? I read there is probably a Word Document or PDF coming but I don't know when. Thanks again Paul

--- 帖子 #232 ---
If there is nothing at all on your screen, I don't know the answer. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Simple, nice and outside the box thank's! billbbs

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi Paul, possible solutions: 1. Go to the indi properties and check that LineColor is NOT set to "none" or black. Choose for example red. 2. In the same indi properties window check SubSymbol, if it has a small letter "m" at the end of the pair USCHF, remove that. If it is not there, put the letter "m" behind it which means mini account. No you don't have to load it twice, once is enough. Don't expect a PDF yet, there are not so many rules and guidelines that it requires a PDF file in my opinion. A simple re-written 1st post would be enough.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Bill, I'm not sure if you noticed, but if I rightly recall, the 50hr data at the correlation table you referred us to seemed a little weird at the beginning of the week. I'm not sure if there is a weekend data issue, or not. I only glanced over it, and I might be mistaken. In any case you will be taking your data at the end of the week so you shouldn't run into that problem if it exists. I put together a table of data that I got from Oanda that shows weekly, monthly, quarterly, 6mo, 1yr, and 2yr correlations for AUD/USD EUR/CHF EUR/GBP EUR/JPY EUR/USD GBP/USD NZD/USD USD/CAD USD/CHF USD/JPY XAG/USD XAU/USD. Maybe it's helpful to you, maybe it's not... I've also been messing around with indices, but nothing looks as good as your method. If you are ever in the mood to overlay Oil, Dow, etc... netdania will do it. I know at the beginning of thread you thought that your SL/TP needed improvement. It seems to fit rather well to me. It will be interesting to see if you feel the same way after your manual back testing. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thank you. That will be very helpful.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Oh hey Bill, Did you see any setups today ? I saw this one and took it on demo (Hopefully it was a setup )

--- 帖子 #238 ---
After deleting the chart and indicator from MT4 FXDD then reloading indicator from this thread second time then was able to load on chart and now looks OK. Now to work finding divergence. Thanks Bill and others posting charts and comments. Paul

GBPJPY vs EURJPY (today) H4 and Daily, Long signal for GBPJPY..am I right?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hey Jig, That trade's as close as it gets, but I'm pretty sure Bill would say that Euro peaked 1 bar sooner than Swissy, so technically, it was a no trade, even though it succeeded as you traded it. Hope this helps, VBro

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Thanks a lot, I see what you mean now with regards to the EURUSD. Can you make up a chart on the Swissy trade by any chance if you can ? I can't seem to get it.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hey Jig, I'd be glad to post a chart for you, but first... I was just glancing at your posted chart and I think you have to check your settings on the moving average lines. It should be: period: 1 type: simple apply to: typical (I think you have this set to 'close') Once you change the settings, I believe that 'Swissy long' I was talking about will disappear. Going to edit my prior post so I don't confuse anyone. VBro

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Ahhh, you are correct.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi Pri, Had a glance at my IBFX charts (GMT) and could not see a long. What is the time zone of your charts? VBro

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi again Pri, Sorry, my bad, just found the 4H long G/J - yes that's a system compliant long there! VBro

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I've finished backtesting EURUSD/USDCHF since March 1 until now. I used very a strict definition for the trades. The same one I've put out here about the peaks and valleys lining up. I'll update post#1 with clear rules when I have time. I also considered a 5 pip spread on CHF and a 2 pip spread on EURO. Also, I let each trade run it's course, either TP or SL. Because of that, these results are worst case scenario. Closing a trade when a counter trade appears, is much more profitable. 46 Trades 36 W 10 L 78.2% Win rate I assumed 3% of account size risked on each trade. (numbers like this justify 3%) Beginning with a $1,000 account on March 1, by the end of today it would equal $2,063

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi Pri, I had a look for the 'daily' long you mentioned. On my charts, E/J &amp; G/J made synchronized daily lows on the 6th and 10th. The second lows (the 10th) created the 'set up', when E/J made new lows, but G/J could not make new lows. Then the trade was 'triggered' the following day, as both pairs turned long. After the close of the trigger day (the 11th), this system would have you taking a long on G/J. But I think you were trying to point out a more recent entry for a 'daily' long in G/J, and I do not see one (in GMT any way). Reason? In my GMT charts, the first lows (10th) are synchronized (happen on exactly the same bar). But the second lows happen on two different bars (G/J on the 14th, E/J on the 15th). Since the second lows do not happen on the same bar, this system does not trade. Hope this helps, VBro

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Looks good Bill. I will post January 09 results on same pair shortly. VBro

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Thank you for this valuable information. I tried to do a backtest using trade simulator but the "overlayed" usd/chf will not be simulated, only the eur/usd on which the actual chart is displayed was simulated. I have 3 questions on which conditions you entered the backtested trades. 1. Did you wait for both pairs to point in the same direction(in mirror mode)? 2. Did you wait for the 15m period to close before entering the trade to confirm the direction? 3. Do you have a certain time when you trade (London, US session)?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Yes Yes No. I traded every signal, regardless of time.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thanks Bill, sounds good.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi, Just completed manual backtest of January 09, 15 min only, Euro/Swissy. - Took all trades, according to the strict 'synchronization' rules. - TP: 2 x ATR14, SL: 2 x ATR14 - So, R:R = 1:1 - Enter trade at close of 'trigger' bar (in other words, 14:59 after close of second peak/valley bar) - In the case of a second trade in the same direction before the first trade closed (on either currency), I added a second trade. - In the case of a second trade in the opposite direction before the first trade closed (on either currency), I closed the first trade and opened the new direction trade. Here's what I got - January 2 - January 31 37 trades 20 wins 12 losses 5 reversals (trades closed early due to reversal signal) Not counting reversal trades which were near enough to breakeven, that's 20 wins of 32 trades, or 62.5%. A very solid percentage. Will look at February next. VBro

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Great result Bill. How many of the 10 losers do you estimate would have been eliminated if counter trends were implemented? ps - I'm very grateful for you sharing your method with us. It looks very promising indeed. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Two, maybe three, would be my guess.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Let's touch base and make sure we're doing it the same way. Would you take this trade?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Good Idea. No, because of the small peaks in the valley. Do I have it right? VBro

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Yep. I was avoiding those too. We're on board.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thank you, Jay. I hope we can make some money with it.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Sometimes, it's not WHAT you know...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Bill So looking at your image that you posted you wouldn't have taken the trade you highlighted because of the peaks/spikes in the valley BUT you would have taken the one just preceding because there's no spikes? Trust trying to get my head around it. Been doing quite well testing this method this week and last. Lux

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Lux, White makes a second low which is lower, but yellow's second low is higher. So, long yellow after the uptick is a system compliant trade. Is that the trade you meant? (if you meant the prior short white, that's a no trade, as the first peak does not happen on the same bar for both pairs) Hope this helps, VBro

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Bill, I've done Feb, 15 min (same specifications as prior Jan test), and here's what I found. 24 trades 11 wins 11 losses 2 reversals Maybe you want to run Feb yourself and see if your test comes up different? VBro

--- 帖子 #263 ---
hi vbro, sure this helps my chart GMT+2, thank's for the explanations clear enough for me.. perhaps I should wait for the next daily bar, hope new low happen on E/J.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
RR3 trade as per the charts. Vertical line marks the point where I spotted the divergence. I took the trade on the next bar.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Impressive result!! Thank you, Bill, for sharing your system!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=161 Setup MA as per Bill's instructions, add the above indi - see link -choosing correct 2nd pair in its setting - don't type "m" at the end of the currency name; and setting mirror to true if one of the pairs is USDCHF.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I just did Feb. and got 9W - 7L. I understand how we can vary. It's extremely painstaking and subject to error. At least it is for me. I think it's safe to say that Feb. was a breakeven month, at best. I'm going to go back over all of it, in the next couple of days. I've seen some things that will help the results. The 2xATR is one of them. If the trade occurs soon after big news bars, the news bars are computed into the ATR, and sets the PT at an unrealistic level. Maximum Excursion studies are the right way to determine SLs and PTs. I'm sure I can complete them this weekend. Any system that does better than a random coin toss, is of value and can be fine tuned. This one does considerably better than that, if my Mar-Apr results are correct. I'm going to check them again. I'll be back when I have something to report. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Bill, have you thought of using price action and/or support/resistance for SL and TP? Pair divergence is good at determining entry period, but observing nearest SR levels could give a better clue as to SL and TP that just ATR. Just a thought

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I use S&amp;R levels in my own trading, but they are subjective. No two people draw them the same. I want an objective and definable SL and PT for this, so it will be completely mechanical.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I traded today so far the eur/usd short for a nice quick 35 pips. ATR was 37 pips but I closed manually for 2 pips less than TP due to strong support around the 1.3060 level. Afterwards I am glad i closed the position earlier, otherwise I would have to wait 30 minutes before the TP (2pips more) would have been hit. And it would have been stressing too due to pretty much drawdown. It was not a textbook trade, but in my opinion the eur/usd needed to make a bearish correction vs. the strong bullish(mirror) momemtum in usd/chf.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Here is the first intro to the indi I've been using to speed my backtesting and help me get closer to getting alerts during London (middle of night for me). 1. I set MT to only show close price and set the color to really dark green so it isn't a distraction. 2. The indi shows the 1 SMA Typical as bright yellow which is really what I need to see. 3. The indi draws 2 upper and 2 lower ATR bands spaced 1 ATR apart so I can see the ATR's flow along with price. 4. The indi draws the inverted USDCHF, in this case it's below EURUSD for no reason - it's just for visual comparison. 5. The indi monitors peaks and valleys in both currencies and ONLY puts the arrows if they occur in both pairs simultaneously, like mini fractals based on only 3 bars. 6. When it's time to trade I can switch MT to show bars, like in the second screen. Once I get the indi to automatically move the second pair into easy visual position I'll post it for any who'd like it.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Quite prety pictures ! So plz post your amazing indi/template !

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I'll be glad to see it.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Is it smth written specifically for Bill's system or smth which was developed to show divs in principle? Looks interesting. What do those arrows show?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Wasn't that almost the OPPOSITE of a textbook trade?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I eagerly await this indicator! Thanks pippaFett for taking the time to do this.

hi bill, The overlay chart is in line. why changed the existing chart to ma with 1, simple, typical. Should we compare with same format. line to line. or your overlay chart is also in ma 1,simple and typical regards

billbss &amp; Everyone Last week I took 3 trades using this method on the EUR/USD-USD/CHF &amp; all three were winning trades. These were all in demo mode, but this week I will give the method a go on a small live account I have strictly for trying out a new method or idea. Bill, I am most interested in the results of your weekend correlation studies. Anyone willing to share their pair correlation views or comments &amp; trading results for last week I would be most interest. This seems to be a good method with NO downside that I can see thus far. ____________________________

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Stay on demo until I get the results compiled. 1. A member has provided me an indicator that makes the backtesting much more reliable. I am using it now to get more accurate results for EU-UC, for the last 3 1/2 months. 2. I believe I have found a much better SL and TP, than the ATR. I'm still testing this. I'll try my best to get this posted today. If not, I'll shoot for tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
billbss, I'll stay on demo &amp; await your correlation results.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Yes sir, do not try it at home! The reason for the opposite entry: chf was being bought heavily, I knew the BIG correction needed to come from the usd, and it did.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Dear Billbss, Thanks indeed for a very exciting finding. I tried the EUR/JPY versus the GBP/JPY. However, I do need to re-confirm your following statement: Your Statement: "The chart below shows the EUR/JPY and the GBP/JPY, together. Basically, if one pair makes a lower low and the other does not, you buy the one that does not. If one pair makes a higher high and the other does not, sell the pair that does not. I wait until both pairs have turned in the direction of the trade, before entering." Clarification 1: Q1-"if one pair makes a lower low and the other does not". How do I determine that one is making a lower low than the other? If both value is lower than the 20MA, the current price value is the determinant for the lower low? Example : Now ( 20/4/09 10.00.am Malaysian time), EUR/JPY is 128.34 and GBP/JPY is 145.55. Does that mean that EUR/JPY at 128.34 is the lower low? Or is it lower low is determined by the distance ( measured in pips) between the current value and the MA line for both? Please help elaborate. Clarification 2: Q2- "I wait until both pairs have turned in the direction of the trade, before entering." Does this mean ensuring the candles concur - bullish (up) or bearish (down) candles appears for both? Please help elaborate. I think this correlation is great. I tried a few times, it works but I wasn't confident if I had determined the lower low or higher high correctly. Need your help. Thank you MartGarbera martgarbera@gmail.com

--- 帖子 #285 ---
This has nothing to do with a 20 MA. Here is a link to a post that might help. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=18 You might go back and read the first few pages. We don't look at candles, at all.

That sounds great. The indicator is not mine. I will need the permission of the author to post it. The person it belongs to, may read this and choose to post it if he wants. I don't want to say who it is, because I want to respect his privacy. I don't think it will help you as much as it has helped me. It marks coincident peaks and valleys. I noticed on the chart you posted, that you don't necessarily look for those. If you'll give us another example of what you're doing maybe we can help you test. I'll be finished with what I'm doing tomorrow, and will be glad to help. Thanks for your work. It looks like it's really paying off.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
billbss, can you please post your better way of putting the SL and TP?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
What I thought was better didn't work out. I'll post everything I found as soon as I look at a few more things. This stuff is SLOW. It's like picking salt out of sugar

--- 帖子 #290 ---
1)I understand bill i also take valley and hill but as its done in 5 min tf and there are lots of divergence causing a little offset in peaks and valley so i take peaks and valley which coincides even with small divergence. 2)bill it will be helpfull to test it long term in luxint indi it worked fine till march 1 from feb onwards there is lot of distance between peaks of usdchf and eur usd using lux indi its very difficult if u have indi which marks peaks together then i think its lot easy to do it rest on you. full credit of the concept goes to you bill as u originated this concept and we have to work like a team more people will test and have there concept more its good.

My first time on this thread. It was brought to my notice by Forex007, and I spent some of the weekend reading through the thread and trying to get my head around it. Just thought I'd post this chart to see if I'm getting it right. All relevant points are marked......any comments appreciated, mate. Looks like a nice pip-collector, bill. Cheers

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I like that one, good example! Red makes a significant HH, yellow does not, sell yellow. If in mirror mode, buy yellow.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Nice one, EV! Did you use ATR for exit or smth else?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Artov....glad you like the trade. It's encouraging to know I'm going in the right direction!! Forex007.....hello, mate. No, I didn't use the ATR for exit. I was called away from the computer in a hurry, so I just closed the trade there and then. These things happen in this house, mate....can't be avoided! Thanks for pointing me to this thread and the method. I love K.I.S.S. !!!!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
How do you get variable R:R, are you using the nearest top or bottom as stop?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Two r.r used a)in favour of trend or the locality peak r.r =3 b)against the trend r.r = 2 al things are decided on stats and as u know mere 33 trades do not decide the stats so i am working on atleast 200 trades once its done i will out the full stratergy. main focus is to have good r.r and high probablity and low drawdown and more avg pips per months. for a good system ratio avg monthly pips to max dd over 200 trades span must be greater than 10.

Hi Guys, Just a bit confused with euro/usd usd/chf mirror mode is true. Alittle while ago euro made a new low but chf made a higher low, does that mean I should go short chf and do I have to wait for euro to turn down. As I write this chf just made a new high on my chart but euro did not does this mean a short on euro and do i have to wait for chf to turn down, or have i got this all wrong? Kind Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Yes correct if chf did not make a lower low as the euro did, then you short chf but wait first for both pairs to turn in the same direction. Remember if you use the indi from Lux on a eur/usd based chart, then only chf is mirrored, not euro. You always have to wait for both pairs to turn in the same direction on your screen. Yes in this case it would be a short euro, I would not trade it because the previous peak on the eur was not significant and it almost broke the previous peak. Not an A+ trade to me. Also please note volatility for eur/usd is not at it's best when London session is closed.

Hey team, I've packaged up my template, indicators, and a PDF explaining their use. Here's a screen shot.

Hi Bill, Do you take double-divs (as the enclosed example), where you first get a signal for one pair, and then for the other? Taking positions with correlated (opposite positions for inversely correlated) pairs doubles the risk; at the same time, if the signal is there, why shouldn't it be traded... MANY THANKS!

When I place the SBT Overlay Ind on the EUR/USD chart it works as it should, (inverting the USD/CHF). But when I load another chart (like GBP/USD) and then place ind on chart and change its pair to EUR/USD or some other pair it never displays the second pair. I've tried FXDD without the small "m" and IBFX with the small "m" but don't seem to be able to get second pair price on chart. Any ideas? I see other charts on thread with change so I know it can be done. Thanks Paul

I did as much as I could on the backtesting the past weekend. I had some things at home that interfered, and it is extremely slow work, at best. I didn't get to January. vbro had previously tested January and had caame up with 20W and 12L. Here's what I got for February through last Friday, April 17. This was taking all trades. I applied the system rules mechanically. I let each trade run until SL or TP, even if there was a counter trade. I used 2xATR(14) for both SL and TP. Spreads are included in the results. I tested a flat 20 pip stop. It worked great the first week or two, then fizzled. It wound up with the same results as the ATR. February 16 W 15 L March 30 W 26 L April 16 W 5 L Total = 82W / 58L 58.6 % W 41.4 % L This is a little better than a breakeven system, as is. I have only seen a handful of mechanical systems that were profitable, when the rules were strictly followed- maybe two or three in 30 years of trading. Most of what you see are systems that claim to be profitable, but exceptions are made while trading it. Any mechanical system that does better than a coin toss has a solid base. A random coin toss will lose at the rate of (spread x number of trades). If we had entered on a coin toss for 140 trades, We would have lost about 420 pips. We made a few pips with this. I'm sure it can be made better- much better, by refining the divergences and not taking every one of them. The losses seem to mostly occur with the little random bumps that meet the rules for a trade. There are many of these. The problem is, that backtesting this thing is so difficult. It is very subject to error and is very labor intensive and tedious. Before I obtained the indicator I used, I overlooked almost half the trades, while trying to test it. This will make refining it very difficult. Any rule modifications will take a couple of days to test. Anyway, there it is. Anyone who wants to improve it, is welcomed. ForceDevotee is on to something good. I won't have much time to give it. It belongs to anyone who wants it.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I wouldn't take them, while trading. The results probably wouldn't change much if you took them or not. These pairs do not always maintain correlation. Sometimes they go their own way and counter trades would be profitable.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Fantastic job!! You do great work. This will be helpful. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Bill, does this mean you are no longer interested in this method?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
No. I'm interested. I just won't be able to do much more backtesting. Not like I've been doing, anyway.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Could I just ask if I understand correctly? Were you using 2xATR for SL, and multiplying that by 2 (against the trend), and 3(with the trend) for the TP? So for example, if ATR is 20, your TP would be 40 or 60?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I REALLY enjoyed looking at your sons page, the examples of his work were awesome, the Interview really gave me perspective. Really cool. I am rubbish with creating indicators and that side of things, however I will backtest 2008 as a whole and maybe 2007 if I get a chance because I am manually backtesting other stuff anyway, hopefully before my exams come up . However I have a problem (See Chart)(Yes sorry I am terrible with indicators) The time we are testing it over is surely too little a time ? I think it as a whole looks promising, however, I have a few points to raise that are open to anyone. Point One ) What we are essentially doing is waiting for divergence between correlated pairs. We are waiting for them to go out of correlation (eg, USDCHF makes a higher high and EURUSD makes a lower high, there is selling pressure on EURUSD so that's the pair we go short on) However would it not be wiser to . . . Go short on the other one ? Because if selling pressure is coming into one pair, the correlation will eventually correct itself and the USDCHF pair would have more "selling to come" with regards to it ? We are already shorting the pair that has come under selling pressure, whereas it would be better to sell the one with no selling pressure already ? So : 1) Divergence occurs 2) (Using the same example) USDCHF makes a higher high, EURUSD makes a lower high. 3) They both turn down on the next close. 4) Instead of going short on the EURUSD which ALREADY has been under selling pressure, we will short the inversion of the USDCHF - The CHFUSD , so we will basically go long on USDCHF instead of going short on EURUSD and we will then wait for TP at whatever. Like, the whole idea is that of getting in at a better price. Point Two ) A hedge strategy Right so the same thing happens again, USDCHF makes a higher high, EURUSD makes a lower high - fine. This shows us that the USDCHF (it's inverted so it's the CHFUSD ) is out of corelation with the EURUSD. We should short the CHFUSD (It's inverted remember) ( We are going to go long on the USDCHF ) And we will go long onthe EURUSD as well. We then wait for the Opposite to occur (For them both to fall out of sync again, but this time in the other direction . . if you get me) And then we close the trade. I have never, applied this but I will try to forward test it. I have no idea by how many say . . . "pips" they would fall out of sync by, but you have to pay 6 to just get the trade going in the first place. I could well be talking complete and utter rubbish with my second point (And with the first the truth be told) But they are just some ideas I had in my head that I thought I would share. Like if you look at whats happening from a candlestick point of view, when the pairs fall out of sync it is usually because an engulfing pattern has occured on one, or a recognizable candlestick pattern of some sort, and then what we are doing is entering on the break and close of it. Anyway, people in the thread let me know what you think of my ideas, and feel free to comment on them.

I'm new to currency trading, so grab a grain of salt, but Bill's basic premise has been working like magic for me. I've been using it on Guppy against several other pairs. I haven't restrained myself to highs and lows that line up precisely. I don't pretend to have any special insight, but I may have stumbled on something worth trying. I have the candlesticks showing, but very faintly. (I wish I could see them on the second pair, but so far haven't found an indicator to do so). I look for a trade on the M15, and once I see one forming I switch to the M5. Since we are waiting for the candle to close in the correct direction, this gets you into the trade at a better price. I wait for the M5 candle to close in the right direction, and pull the trigger. Maybe it's beginner's luck... not sure, but it seems to work well.

This is a great job bro, keep it up! Any dig up comes back to FF.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
i would like to thank you and others for posting and working on this method. I have opened a live account today to test it. I think for a manual system we might want to watch the p/l when deciding exit point after opening a position, rather than setting a fixed tp and sl point value. Even the mechanical back testing result seems falling short of expectation, in real manual trading the result might be far satisfactory. I am the "grab and run" type of trader, i do not set a big tp and my loss is small. I feel at ease with this methodology, so i want to trade it live.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Here are two indicators I found that you might find useful. Second Chart, at the bottom, displays a second currency pair as small candles in an indicator window below your current main pair. This is showing USDCHF on 5 min below EURUSD on 5 min. Custom Candle comes from a strategy called 3-in-a-box. It draws large candles over the normal candles you see on screen. For example, here we have larger 15 min candles on top of 5 min candles. You can fiddle with the colors to get things to be less confusing. WARNING: If your strategy is based on moving averages on the longer timeframe, like 15 min, remember that if you are watching activity on 5 minutes your MA won't look right. And just multiplying out the 5 min MA x 3 to match the 15 min won't give the same result. Good luck!

Hi pippa, does your indicator work for mini account? I dun see the yellow SMA lines showing

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I made a bad discovery and a good discovery last night. I thought I was finding phases where the 1 min or 5 min for one pair was moving a few bars sooner than the other pair, perfectly predicting movement a few minutes early. But, sadly, I figured out that during slow periods, if there is no volume for a 1 min or 5 min bar, then MT4 just leaves out a bar (I think that's why.) So the further back I looked the further the lines were really just out of sync because of missing candles. To fix it I changed the indi to match date/time stamps for each bar to verify the bars are synced. The good news is that even on 5 min and 1 min there are now many, many more matches showing up than ever, even on short time frames. I also made a few other important improvements: 1) Bars are matched by date/time stamp for perfect syncing 2) I added a secondary pair variable so you can type in any pair name you want. For micro we're seeing that you'd need to maybe type USDCHFm or whatever the exact name used by the broker is. 3) I changed the tweak variable to be in pips. If you need to move the secondary line by 100 pips, you type 100 instead of .01. If you're using 5 decimals, and need to move 35 micro pips you'd type 3.5. Wish list: make it so you can use a secondary pair that isn't inverted

I love this system! Thanks for the hard work and sharing of it! I have two trade ideas for GBP/USD based on USD/CHF and EUR/GBP. Both say long GBP/USD. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Jigsaw, This is off topic, but nice avatar &amp; I want ask where you got the idea from. You are correct....some people just don't appreciate life, but I do &amp; try to live each day to its fullest. I think that was the theme that SAW had in mind along with some get even tactics. He did raise a valid point about people not appreciating life, but using another method to get the point across would have been better. ________________________ AceTrader

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thanks for the indicator, it's beautiful. Do you have any idea what I could be doing wrong? When I try to put EUR/JPY on an EUR/USD chart, I have to flatten the EUR/USD almost completely to see the highs and lows of the EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I literally just got the idea from SAW initially, I saw that movie first when I was pretty young and the idea was like a spectre in my mind which has refused to be exorcised since then. I understand that the whole "torturing people with violence to get them to appreciate life thin is NOT A GOOD IDEA" (Like obviously I do not agree with it) but in ways you have to be that extreme to shake people out of what they take for granted. It's like in fight club when Tyler Durden puts the shop assistant on his knees and points the gun to the back of his head telling but he never had an intention of killiing him, it was just to show him how sweet life really is. I think his quote was "When he wakes up tomorrow his breakfast cereal will be the best he has ever tasted". I know that this is not . . "Achievable" lol , in real life, but I like having stuff around like this - http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/od...ing_a_meal.jpg just to remind me how lucky I am. That child is crawling to the nearest food centre over a kilometre away, nobody knows what happened to her in the end. I guess some people may find looking at that kind of macabre, but for me it instantly places me back in life, where all my petty worries dissapear,. . And I instantly see once again see life anew. Wow, I ranted there heh Take care Ace, Jig EDIT - Again, sorry for the off topic

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi, just joined the club. I think the higher high and lower low did not have anything to do with the correlation strategy as they are correlated. Please see attached picture, the blue line is USDCHF and the red one is EURUSD. So my point is, what makes it fails is the higher high and the lower low strategy. Any other thoughts?

Hi! glad to hear from the man himself on this thread which has gone so quiet. Yes, I followed the basic rules and a M15 tf; but my SL are fixed at 100pips and not ATR14. I used the Multiplecurrencies indicator to help detect the divergence.

Found a site that mentions Spread Bars on charts search for it by "spread bars" Metatrader If someone can code, this might be useful to us.

billbs, first thanks for sharing. I read this thread many many times. somethign i like to confirm. Do you use aways the indicator with default settings and the chart with SMA1 with typical price or another instance of the indicator with the instrument that is the original of your chart? Because the distance between the lines are completly different. Do you think it will not alter nothing in the strategy? i hope this questions is clearly... looks like my English only gets worse. thanks in advance.

I am a newbie, and after how many hours of tinkering, I was able to set up the nice template by pippaFett ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=299 ) Kindly see if my evaluation is correct? EURUSD yellow USDCHF magenta 1h timeframe http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/992...divergence.jpg Right after the first divergence (marked line red lines) of EU having a LH and UC giving a HH, we should wait for a confirmation on the next candle for a BUY on USDCHF right? But on the next candle, it does confirm a BUY on UC, but it showed another divergence going opposite direction? What should I do? Please help.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
@billbss, Thanks for a nice method. Too bad the thread seems not to be as active? @pippFett, Is it possible to make the template more flexible, by making it editable and applicable to other pairs too? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
You should reverse your position.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thanks billbss for the quick reply. Some more questions please. So when we see the reversal, we should wait for another hour when the candle will close? Then we buy at the open of the next candle? Just in case we did not notice the reversal signal, and opened trade, we should close it immediately right? And wait for a confirmation at the close of the next candle again. As it is, as the close of the candle, it showed a reversal, and signalled a BUY for EU. Only then will we open a trade for BUY for EU correct? Oh, btw, even if the 1h timeframe ONLY shows this divergence, it is ok to enter the market? How about if it shows ONLY on 15m, 30m? Should we enter the market too? Can someone be able to make an EA please, that will do the following, when it is turned ON: 1. open a trade at the open of the next candle 2. BUY/SELL can be speciified 3. can be attached to any currency chart and will enter the trade 4. will turn off by itself after the trade was made. I think this will complete this method very well. .

I just went through the thread. I am still confused concerning the stop loss and profit levels. Somebody was using 100 pips for both on 15 min charts with great success according to his results. Is 2XATR still in use? Thanks and regards. Chamane

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Chamane, I'm not entirely sure. From what I've seen the ATR14X2 seems to work OK. 100 pips is quite a move, but does allow a lot of room for volitility. It would probably be more reasonable for GBPJPY correlated pairs...but if it works, by all means. To All, I've developed an EA for this strategy!!! And they said it couldn't be done. It still needs some work, but mostly just to add more configurable properties and I need to do some forward testing to verify everything since automated backtesting doesn't work well when dealing with two pairs (the market info isn't available for the second pair). I've attached a screenshot of a couple recent divergences my EA has identified. I'm not ready to post it yet, but stay tuned. The arrows don't actully signify the entry point, but rather just show the direction you will go after candle close confirmation (the EA will wait for confimation before entring a trade). Also, for a mirrored pair, the arrow is also mirrored, but the EA (if allowed to trade) will enter in the correct direction. I also want to add the ability to email/text message signals since I know a lot of you will want to trade manually, but would like an EA for signals only. I'll try to get this out soon so hopefully some of you will help identify and issues or novel additional features. Please let me know if anyone is still paying attention to this thread and if you are interest. Oh, and HatTip to luxinterior as I used a modified version of his mirroring algorithm for the indicator my EA uses.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I just want to note that my EA would not have taken or signaled this setup due to the spikes in between the divergence. My understanding is this strategy is based on a "single wave" divergence. In other words, the 2 peaks/valleys must be adjacent to each other. I might be pursuaded to include the ability to look for divergence x number of peaks/valleys back (or one of you can when/if I release the source), but it will be tricky. Anyway, I'd love to hear feedback/interest before I modify this to be more end-user friendly. Otherwise I'll just happily use it myself as is. Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Bill, I have a quick question if you would be so kind to answer. In your example on page 2 (see below), the first image, where the new high is made it is a clean wave (3 &amp; 4), however where the new high is not made (1 &amp; 2) there is a mini wave between 1 &amp; 2. Is the "clean wave" you've mentioned only applicable to the pair which makes the lower low or higher high and not necessary for the pair which fails to correlate (diverts). Also I'm noticing that peaks 1 and 3 are not recent highs as both pairs seem to be slightly trending downwards. Is it important or desirable that the first High or Low be an actual recent high or low or is it just divergence in general which should be considered. Thanks in advance for your help. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1238384060 -LucidObscurity

--- 帖子 #395 ---
That example was taken from early in the thread. I later defined rules that would have eliminated 1&amp;2, because of the extra wave. I did this, not because the wave shown as 1&amp;2 would not work, but to try to make identifying these waves and divergences mechanical and less subjective. To sum up, The first chart with the wave marked 1&amp;2 would not qualify.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Thanks Bill, that really helps. My other question I've answered for myself since you were quite clear in that the "new high" or "new low" only needs to be acheived by one pair (the one not to be traded). I've adjusted my EA accordingly. The EA already does not consider non-adjacent Peaks/Valleys. I'll be posting it shortly (probably this weekend). Hopefully you will find it useful as a signal or at least a mechanism to draw a few helpful lines and arrows on your chart. Thanks again!

Thank you for the work you are putting in on this. It is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Interested in ea. Been following greamliners thread with great intrest and we r trying to come up with something similar

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Bill, I am pleased to see a revival of interest in your endeavor. I will follow with great interest. Good Trading!

Hi all Personnally I'm using a different way to trade divergences with correlated pairs. On my chart, I put the linear price action for commodity and the indy Price Difference with both correlated pairs . For example with EURCHF, I'm using Price Difference with USDCHF and EURUSD. You can see this indy is the "mirror" of our pair. But sometimes there is a nice divergence on any TF. In 5M, we can use that as a scalping technique. These divergences unfortunately are rare but when they occur, it's a strong signal. Two following examples.....

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Another chart as scalping.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
OK, there are at least a few people who are paying attention, so I'll go ahead and make the EA more user friendly and get it ready to post. I mentioned releasing something this weekend, but I'm hesitant to do so since I haven't had a chance to test the trade entry logic since I finished it late in the week and the market closed before I could run through a trade. I'll try to release a "signal only" version this weekend, but no promises.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
That sounds good. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
hi Lucid. I was going to request someone something like it. I really need a alert to wake me up when there is a signal. i don't know how your EA works but i i believe there is a minimum number of pips or angle filter you use. If so i think it is a good idea to let the user change this number to fine tune the best settings. many thanks and contraulations for being able to do it.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
There is, and you can specify numbers smaller than 1 (i.e. 0.5 for half a pip), however from what I've seen, I would keep this number at around 1 pip.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Here is the signal only version. the Overlay indicator is based on luxinterior's however I had modify the way it draws the line with the offset based on the current screen in order for everything to be consistently relative. Basically what this means is the two lines may move away from each other a bit more than in luxinteriors indicator. Note, these rely on data for the second pair being available. If the line does not draw far enough then open a window for the second pair on the same timeframe and hold down the "Home" key for a while to pull in more data. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. Please drop these in the following folders Overlay.ex4 - C rogram Files[Your MT4 Folder]expertsindicators Correlating Pair Divergence - Signal Only.ex4 - C rogram Files[Your MT4 Folder]experts

--- 帖子 #407 ---
ok when i put indi on chart i get no overlay and when i put ea on i get no overlay, or arrows or anything. have smiley face what am i doing wrong? or does market need to be open?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
No it doesn't. If you are not signed into a mini account then remove the "m" in the SubSymbol property.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
If we could know when to take long or short, then why correlate any charts? Actually the best Idea would be to take close appositive correlated pairs like EURUSD and USDCHF for example. At the same time BUY one pair and BUY/SELL the other (Sell Dollar in 1st pair and Buy Dollar in the other) , so while one of the trades goes positive the other goes negative. You just wait until you got positive profit between both trades. This is a hedge you cannot lose anything, but theoretically there should be a time when one pair would fall more then other rise or vise versa, just wait till your hedge turn positive then close both trades.. Have to play with this to see Just not sure how to place 2 orders on different pairs at the very same time Need buy and sell at the same time 2 different pairs..

--- 帖子 #410 ---
The EUR/USD- USD/CHF is all I wound up trading with this. I disagree with the rest of your post. 1.You CAN lose with this hedge. 2. You do better trading only one of the pairs. I addressed that in the thread.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Did that. Not working

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Refresh by switching between time frames once or twice.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Looks good. I'll try it out. Thanks a million.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Oh, yeah, once you give it an invalid symbol you'll have to remove and re-add it.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I want to point out a couple things. 1) if you give the EA an invalid pair then it will need to be removed and re-added. I'm pretty sure it gets stuck in a loop in this situation and correcting the invalid property does not get it out. I'll build something in to identify invalid symbols. 2) You need data for the "SubSymbol". If you have never opened this symbol for the timeframe you are targeting then you do not have any data. Also, due to this, once the market opens you will probably need to keep a chart open for the SubSymbol to keep the data current. I'll look into whether there is a way around this.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
changed symbol from the beginning. I knew I had to change it from the get go. Have had both charts for a week. Not working

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I'm sorry you're having difficulty. This isn't the final version, but I wanted to get something out so people could start taking a look at historical data. The only other thing I can think of which may cause problems is if you set the historical candles to a value larger than the number of candles available for either pair. Currently it only checks the pair which the chart is for to make sure there are enough historical candles. Is the indicator working? Do you see any errors in the Expert output log? A zero divide will stop an EA in its tracks...or any red exclamation icon.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I'll have some feedback for you a little later. The data seems to shift horizontally as you pull the charts back to look at the past. I'll take a screenshot to show you what I mean when I get the time.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I've made a few modifications which you might find helpful. I think only one person is having problems, but that's one too many in my book. I've added some checks so that if the symbol is invalid or there is not data for it then the EA and the indicator will not run and will raise an alert to let you know. I've also added an option to display alerts when a new divergence is detected incase you are near your computer you don't have to wait for the text message or email. I'm still testing the automated trading version and would like to add a few more features before I post it. When I release the automated trading version I will also realease the source code since I feel it's important to know exactly what it is doing before trusting it with your money. If you intend to use any automated trading EA I recommend you spend some time learning MQL. Feedback is always appreciated and I'll happily consider feature request, but any changes will be at my discretion.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Here's what I was talking about. All the peaks and valleys appear to be one bar out of sync. That is not characteristic of these pairs. The farther back you look the more pronounced it is. That will only effect backtesting. The current screen appears to be ok.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Yeah, it will go up and down like that. I know it's not ideal for viewing, but I had to change the way luxinterior's indicator worked so that the lines and arrows would be in the right place relative to the indicator line. He originally coded it to work one screen at a time (it drew everything relative to the high and low of the current screen). I changed this so that everything is relative to the high and low of all candles available. I'll try to come up with a better approach, but I'll have to do some brainstorming.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Ah, I see what you mean. I'll take a look and post a fix as soon as I can.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Not up and down- One of the lines has shifted to the right, so the peaks ans valleys are not coincident.. The up and down doesn't bother me.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
I appreciate your concern!! I have been watching football all day. Will try again tonight. Thanks

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I'm getting different results, but I'll still look into it since you are clearly experiencing an problem. I'll let you know what I find

--- 帖子 #426 ---
It could be that my data on one of the pairs is corrupted. If there was a bar missing, it might cause that.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
ok working but only on mini cant get it to work on standard account no matter what i do?? but that is ok ill just practice on mini account

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello Lucid, The Overlay indicator is not working for me too. The overlayed pair is appearing way atop the chart and cannot be seen. The previous Overlay indicator posted here by bill (OverlayChartLine) is displaying fine, but your indicator is not. I would appreciate your help in solving the issue. Regards

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I've throughly explained this behavior. The previous indicator was by luxinterior and is much better to use for pure visual analysis. I had to modify the indicator to move around like that. It is very important that the two prices remain consitently relative throughout the chart. NOTE: I have just noticed a bug with the Overlay indicator when it is running forward. When redrawn (open properties and hit OK w/out changing anything) it redraws differently. The is affecting the EA as it uses the indicator. I believe I have corrected the issue, and am currently running the indicator through a few months in the backtester to verify. I'll have it posted shortly.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Updated Overlay Indicator! This release resolves a bug which will affect whether the EA spots divergence in real time and not just historically. If you are using the EA please download this latest revision of the indicator. I appologize if anyone missed the EURUSD USDCHF trade an hour and a half ago. Edit: It's looking like there is still and issue when running forward. I guess this is what I get trying to use someone elses code without taking the time to fully understand it. I'll get it figured out and be back with a solution once I'm positive it's good to go.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I guess I didn't really help with a solution in my earlier post. What I do in this situation is to grab the right side of the chart with my mouse and drag up or down to re-scale the chart. I'm afraid this is the only way to mitigate the necessary behavior. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks bud , i guess i figured it out now. I was trying to run it on a Standard account while this seems to work only on a mini. cool, will follow along now.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
It works fine on both my mini and standard accounts, but you have type in the correct SubSymbol for both the indicator and the EA (it should be the same as the text in the top left of the chart.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yeah made extra sure to use all correct symbols still only work in standard. Will download mt4 again and see if that helps

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Does anyone with programming knowledge have any advice on getting this indicator to draw the same way in real-time as it does for historical candles. It's been over a year since I wrote an indicator (I usally just draw straight from the EA), and I could swear I've fought with this issue and figured it out before. I've been digging around the internet and have found people experiencing the same issue, but have yet to find a solution. There seems to be some confusion about just how exactly the IndicatorCounted() function performs. Even when I try to re-process the last few candles (not ideal) it still draws differently historcally than in real time. I'll try to dig through my old stuff and see if I can find something I wrote which will answer my questions, but I've got MT4 installations from 5 or 6 different brokers and I've written so much stuff it may take a while. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Bill, I believe I've solved this one. This happened to me as well and then I noticed I didn't have a USDCHF window open for the same timeframe (I had one open, but for a lower timeframe). Once the EURUSD chart moved to the next candle and I then refreshed the Overlay indicator I noticed the shift. After I corrected the timeframe on the USDCHF chart (I also did a right click "Refresh", but I'm not sure that was necessary) and then refreshed the indicator again everything shifted back to normal. It seems it's very important to keep that window open for the SubSymbol and keep it on the right timeframe at all times. Let me know if you think this does not correlate with what you experienced. Thanks. To All, Still working on the real-time vs historical data indicator issue, but I think I've got a solution. I'm not posting anything else until I'm absolutely sure. Stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Lucid, It doesn't work for me. I appear to be missing about 2 bars the first hour on the second pair. Another bar drops out about every day, on average. This is on a 15M chart. The data itself for that pair (USDCHF) is complete when placed on its own chart. In other words, the overlay pair misses bars of data which causes the divergences to not align with the first pair.- this is even though the missing data is present when the pair is placed on its own chart. The same thing is happening with luxinterior's overlay indicator. Thanks again for all your help.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Thanks for the feedback. This related to the same thing I'm dealing with regarding the indicator displaying differently in real-time than historically. Basically this is due to the fact that when a new bar opens for one pair, the other may or may not have gotten the next bar yet. The candles are stored in an array (programming term) and the current candle is always index 0 of this array. Luxinterior and I have both been assuming that the arrays for the two pair will coencide by index; however this is not necessarily the case. I'm adding logic to check the time stamp of each candle for both pairs to make sure the code is comparing apples to apples. After I've verified this thouroughly (may be a couple days) I'll get a fix out, but I don't want to clutter the thread with releases, so I'm going to test for at least a day first.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi Bill, I've got a quick question. Is the example on the right below considered divergence? The mirrored USDCHF made a new low (though there was a lower low about 25 candles back, but for the purpose of my question, please ignore this fact) while EURUSD did not; however, EURUSD did not even make a new valley. Is this considered divergence? Also, on the left you'll see what looks to be divergence, but valleys involve two candles and the second peaks also involve two candles. Is this considered divergence. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I might trade them, but..... they do not qualify as divergences per the rules given in this thread. I looked the entire chart over and I didn't see any trade set ups- no divergences.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Thanks Bill, BTW, I've been testing the changes to the indicator most of the day and they look good. It won't be long and we should all be getting very useful text messages...hopefully freeing up some time for...the more important things in life. Take care.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Thank you . You're doing a great job. I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
you mean, the first two lines in his chart is not a valid setup? Why? White line made a new high, aqua did not.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
You are correct. I overlooked that.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
ok. 1 are you taking trades with wich frequence? 1, 3, 5 per day? 2 there was people in this thread taking trades even in 5 min. Are you taking tradings in this TF too? many thanks for reply.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I haven't counted. I would say three a day. I usually fan through the time frames until I see a set up.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
but even 5, 1 TF? thanks

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I will trade 5M- not 1M.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
OK, I definatelly need to refine the EA a bit. It really needs to be less picky about what is a peak and what is a valley. I'll be introducing a parameter which will allow you to specify a maximum number of candles for a given movement (a low, high, low for a peak or a high, low, high for a valley). This will allow the EA to recognize many more setups and to work on the lower timeframes. Please be patient. You won't be dissapointed.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
ok. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I would have traded this euro buy, would you?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
At this moment we have come to a situation where the USD/CHF has reached a strong support level. The EUR/USD would be apx. 150 pips away from a possible resistance level. See attachments. This might give us more trading opportunities as the 2 pairs might not correlate as much due to the different support/resistance levels. Se keep your eyes on the charts these days.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Update: trade would have closed for profit.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Well, I'm finally done. I've vastly improved the divergence detection algorithm and have added a few additional configurable properties and features. The Overlay indicator has been fixed and I've done what I could to make sure it refreshes properly when switching timeframes; however, you should switch the timeframe of the SubSymbol first. Please let me know if any of you see anything strange or if you have any questions. Edit: For newcomers, the "Overlay.ex4" file is an indicator and the "Correlating Pair Divergence - Signal Only.ex4" file is an expert. Please place in the appropriate folders.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
many thanks. Lucid, this will help me to test the system. you said that was thinking in post the mq4 so people can trade using real money with confidence. Well, i think make this indicator is enough. I highly recomend to do not post the source. Maybe share it with senior members or with others you feel confortable. If you post the source, they will send it at ebay tomorrow. BTW i am not a coder and don't want the mq4. many thanks again.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Thanks for the advice. I will probably not be posting the source. I hope you all enjoy the EA. I've been trying to perfect spike detection in many of my EA's. This algorithm is by far the best. It could use some optimization, but it won't miss a thing. Be careful with the SpikeMinPips, if it is set too large for a given timeframe and there are no spikes on the chart which meat the critera, the code will go through a lot of iterations trying to find them. It will finish, but may take 30-60 seconds (compared to much less than a second if there are plenty of spikes).

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Oh, one more thing, don't set the SpikeMaxCandles to anything less than three. It takes at least three candles for a spike and I forgot to build in a check for that.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
yesterday there was a signal 13:00 GMT on EURUSD. With SpikeMaxCandles set to 3, it will use 11:00, 12 and 13 GMT to give the signal or it will vie a signal only at 16:00 GMT?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Thanks for the great work that you have been doing. I have placed the new overlay on the chart but get nothing showing. If I put the previous overlay on the chart it shows What could be the problem. Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #460 ---
It does not validate the trade for you. You'll have to wait for the next candle which forms in the correct direction. I'm only seeing two signals at 12:00 and 13:00 GMT on the 1H chart. The first would have lost and the second would have won (unless you actively managed the trade). You would have gotten signals at 13:00 and 14:00 GMT. Edit: Sorry, I was looking at the 1H chart. Not the 15M.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
If there is a problem with the ability to retrieve data for the SubSymbol then the indicator will only draw from the right side of the chart as new data comes in (as long as new data for that symbol is coming in from another chart). Make sure you have historical data.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Lucid, Thank you! My overlay isn't working , either. I have plenty of historical data. I'm aware of the postscript and that isn't the problem.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
OK, I think I know what might be going on. I added logic to not run the indicator if the current bar for the chart pair (by timestamp) is not the same bar as the current bar for the SubSymbol. Please let me know if this corresponds with what you are seeing. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
That's what it was. I had a final bar for EUR/USD, that I didn't have for CHF. I deleted it and it works. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
@billbss, Hi, if I used the indicator as posted here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&amp;postcount=70 , how can I add the arrows as shown in the indicators provided here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=299 @pippaFett, http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=316 Is there an option to turn off the "mirror" effect on the secondary pair? Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #466 ---
You can't add the arrows to the first indicator you listed. I don't know which of the last two indicators you should download. I haven't used those indicators.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
but i was talking about the 1h chart i can see a signal in the 13:00 GMT bar. This arrow was there at the open of the 14:00 bar? thanks for reply. EDIT: one more question. If i want to let the EA running many TFs for a given pair, i need to let a chart openened for each time frame or can i let only one chart for the 1min time frame opened?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Sorry if this seems a bit on the dumb side, but if, for example, you are looking at the divergence/difference/correlation between GBPUSD and EURUSD, both are referenced to the USD, so you are essentially looking at the EURO v the GBP. This is what you get if you look at the EURGBP pair directly. So why bother with the rigmaroll and just trade that pair?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
1. We aren't looking at the GBPUSD and EURUSD, were looking at the EURUSD and USDCHF. 2. You can't look at a cross pair and see divergence, between its components.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
The signal will always occur on the close of the candle where you see the arrow. You'd have to have 1 chart open for the primary pair per timeframe, but I'm not sure if you can just leave one 1M chart open for the SubSymbol. It might work.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Sorry, this is wrong. The signal will occur on the close of the bar after the one which has the arrow

--- 帖子 #472 ---
OK, I'll use those pairs. EURUSD is the EUR referenced to the USD. USDCHF is the USD referenced to the CHF. (Which is the inverse of the CHF referenced to the USD). Since both pairs have a common reference, any divergence that is noticed is the difference between the uncommon parts of the pairs, namely the EUR and CHF. This is what you see when you look at the EURCHF, is it not? Basically the three currencies form an interlinked triangle, and a change in any two legs is shown by a corresponding change in the third. I must be missing something, as I just cannot see the point, as it seems to be adding complexity to the simple.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Here is a chart of EURCHF. There are at least three tradeble divergences between EURUSD and USDCHF,(as described by the system) during this time- maybe more. Strip the complexity out of it for us. Use this chart and point out the system trades. Then tell us how you detected them. I would like to know how to do it.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
The reason why I wouldn't trade directly EUR/GBP is the low volatility and high spread of that pair compared to EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Just as an example I have taken Friday's range for those pairs; EUR/USD: 74 pips with a 2 pip avg. spread. GBP/USD: 84 pips with a 3 pip avg. spread. EUR/GBP: 33 pips with a 4 pip avg. spread. I hope that explains why it's a lot more interesting to trade EUR/USD and GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Bills, this is a trade for you?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Red line? No. The second valleys do not happen at the same time.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
ok. Thanks for the quickly reply @Lucid i think it is not necessary to mantain a chart opened for the subsymbol, only swith between time frames is enough to collect data.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I probably would have traded it. It isn't a system trade, though. The final peaks, on the two pairs do not happen at the same time. They are one bar off.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I deleted my post because I saw this one before hand... I agree, there are some trades that aren't "A+" -- more thoughts in a sec.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
The question I like to ask myself on trades that aren't no-brainers: "is the underlying concept/reason of the trade still evident?" In the attached chart, I would say yes on both highlighted red areas. In the first, U/C is exactly flat where E/U is dramatically down; this is still divergence in my book (but what do I know ). Had the slope of the first U/C line even been slightly negative, I would have counted it out. In the second highlighted area, sure, the swing high of the second E/U peak is technically one bar off, but look at it overall. I don't know any other way to say it, but take the average of both adjacent bars with your eyes, and you can see that it still shows us what the market is thinking: U/C went higher while E/U went lower, ala divergence. Now whether you put money on trades that alllllllmost fit your system criteria is a different question, which is why this forum exists

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I do the same thing, as you, when I'm trading. I tried to make this a totally mechanical system, so there is no doubt and no fudging on the entrances. It will make money trading it that way- which is very rare. Systems with discretionary components aren't systems.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
You trade it like you'd trade any other. I cannot understand why you need to look at three to trade one, as the price movement in the one you are trading is all that really matters, since that is what determines your result. All the divergence (which is actually what this pair is) shows you is the relative strength of the two currencies you are NOT trading, and I cannot see the relevance there. Actually the spread is the major factor, since the per pip value would make up the difference in profit/loss. $/pip is much higher on the EUR/GBP pair so the spread also being higher would tax the profits. The lower range is the reason for the correlation, which brings me to another thought..... Since the two are so strongly correlated, and this correlation is long standing, any deviation would have a high probability of being of small nature and short duration, since the two pairs are likely to return to the normal correlation. Would it not, therefore, be a better signal, when the two pairs show movent in unison rather than divergence? Moves in unison show the relative strength or weakness in the $ which is the actual "mover" in the triad, and the currency you are trading against, and this is more likely to produce bigger and more sustained moves, thus giving better trade results. I do not mean to butt in or offend, but trading on divergence just seems to be a lower probability strategy. As I said before, I am missing the point of the exercise completely. I do look for correlation in pairs, but only to confirm which currency is the real "mover" and then determining which is the most likely of that currency's pairing to give best trade. (As you show above, cable is normally a very good mover when trading the $).

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I suspect you don't understand because you don't know what we're doing. Your posts bear strong evidence of that. We only trade one pair, for starters. We do not hedge the pairs. We do not look at three pairs. Trading EURCHF would approximate a hedge . That's not what this system does. Read a little bit of the thread so you know what's going on and then if you have any suggestions, I'll be happy to read them.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
all we want is that YOU show for us where were the entries and exits in the chart he posted.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I don't know how you trade. If you are profitable by just looking at price on a chart, congratulations! It is a feat that many hope to accomplish. In this thread, we are examining what appears to be a high probability win rate method with entry triggers based upon the correlation of two currency pairs. There are other threads on forexfactory that deal with trading crosses such as EUR/CHF outright; however, they are not exactly analogous to this method. This last bit concerns me that we may not be comparing apples to apples: You say you look for correlation, but then propose that you can find correlation by looking at pip range alone, which simply isn't true. Maybe you can clarify?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Euro buy would have closed for profit on the 15m. Were there any others today on the 15m? I didn't see any on a quick glance.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
There was one at 6:45 GMT. It hit profit.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi, I would like to know if there are trades according to rules just prior and after the vertical line. Yellow line is reversed USDCHF. So prior to the line would be a sell USDCHF and after a buy EURUSD? Thanks. http://i26.tinypic.com/ndlb4p.gif

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Neither would be trades according to the system, as they appear on your chart..

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I suspect that the reason is because the real yellow bottom is slightly at the right of the vertical line whereas the black bottom is right on the line...

--- 帖子 #491 ---
The one to the left of the line had an extra wave in the yellow pair. The one to the right, the last valley wasn't in sync. That one was a trade on my chart. I suspect you have your lines drawn wrong.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
How can that be? I understand the extra wave at the first vertical line, but at the second and third, everything looks in sync to me. http://i30.tinypic.com/2cxazye.gif

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I don't know. The valleys at the first vertical line are in sync on my chart. They aren't on your chart. It may be the difference in the data feed.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
That is not reassuring. I think I will be following the strategy with two different charts one on top of the other with no indicator. Thanks for answer.

I don't think it's anything to worry about. The next time it may be good on your chart and not on mine. That's the difference in brokers. Using two charts won't help anything.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I just identified a little bug with the EA regarding the signal at 6:30 GMT. If you were looking at a USDCHF chart with the EURUSD overlay you would have gotten a signal, but visa versa and it would not have signalled. I also found another little bug where it may send more than one email for a long signal. Once I put the EA and Overlay into a single indicator I'll release it. Hope everyone made a few percent today

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Mine signaled on the EURUSD chart.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Here's some feedback, if it helps. The divergence I gave marked with the white arrows isn't valid because of the extra wave in the overlayed pair. I still have the problem of the overlayed pair shifting because of missing bars. Maybe nothing can be done about it.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I can't seem to duplicate the shifting, though I could before I made some changes. Have you tried a right click | refresh on the chart? Ahh, you're right. I know what the problem is. I can solve that. I'll put it in the next release which will be just one indicator which will draw both lines and the signals.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
I'm seconding this...

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Looks like this euro buy missed taking profits by just a hair and then went to a loss, but I didn't trade it. Anyone take an 'L' here?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I saw it- Lucid's indicator filtered it out, because it didn't meet the 1 pip spike requirement. It missed profit by 2 pips.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hmm, well now I see that the line is flat in the chart I posted, but it definitely was peaked on my screen at the time, and depending on the Y-axis scale, it will either peak or go flat. Now that I look at the values, you're right, there was no 'spike'. Humph.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
today when i saw correlation at mataf...GBPJPY n EURJPY, positive correlation 88.2 ( daily correlation )...that means we can go long when one of pairs make LowerHigh ( LH ) or we can short when one of pairs make HighLower ( HL )...correct me if im wrong... any comment...10q.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
@Lucid i just get a pop up message about a signal on EURUSD 5 min to buy EURUSD. The other pair in the overlay indicator is GBPUSD. but there is neither arrows nor vertical lines in the chart. Even switching time frames the sifnal does'nt appears. and how can i hear a wav i choose every time @billbs are you taking the majority of the signas given by the EA or there is much difference in the trades you consider correct and thoose showed by the EA? for example. 1:45 GMT was a valid buy EU signal against USDCHF? and now EJ against GJ, 5 min 03:15 GMT?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
again, a new signal and no arrows in the chart: 2009.09.16 00:59:54Correlating Pair Divergence - Signal Only EURJPY,M5: Alert: Go Long on EURJPY. Identified at candle: 2009.09.16 06:45:00

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I take them if I am around. I have only seen one that was a bad signal and I informed Lucid about it. I didn't have a signal at 1:45. I only trade EURUSD- USDCHF.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
ok, thanks billbs. I thought you were taking trades using GU/EU, EG/GU and GJ/EJ. @LucidObscuri 16:40 GMTthere was a signal on EU that only appread after i changed time frame. Looks like sometimes the EA stops to works with no reason. and happened the contrary now. i got this signal to short GU (overlay EURUSD) but when i changed time frames the signal did not appread again: 2009.09.16 14:30:01Correlating Pair Divergence - Signal Only GBPUSD,M5: Alert: Go Short on GBPUSD. Identified at candle: 2009.09.16 20:15:00 i am using FXpro MT4 (GMT+3)

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Textbook entry off of USD/CHF? Easily hit profit target, almost went 4x ATR.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
M30 again there was a BUY signal on EURUSD, but after change/refresh time frames there is no signal anymore.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Billbs, do you consider this as a setup? see that the first red line is not exactly a bottom, but the reason for it is that EUR was not strong enough to react, whereas USDCHF was weak enough toreact at tjat point. for you this is a setup?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Does any one have any script that you can buy sell to pairs with differant lot size

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Did you mean to post a chart?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
LOL. I am worse day after day. The fact that i can't determine the best time of the day to trade is the reason. So i make all mistakes possible. well, i will edit the post avoce and post the chat.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
You still didn't post anything. I'm not sure, but I think the site is messed up this morning.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Same problem here, recent attachments don't get attached.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
This sounds like a job for SuperTwee

--- 帖子 #518 ---
i'll try to upload the thumbnail. my two cents, looks like another "1 pip spike" filtered trade. i.e. no trade.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
i uploaded it after sent the message above. But yes, FF was messed up today.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
It still isn't there, unless I'm messed up.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
here it is: http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/7638/64141998.gif

--- 帖子 #522 ---
That would be a trade. It would also probably be filtered out by the indicator, with its default settings.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
you mean the new EA, right? many thanks for asnwers all questions.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Yes- the EA.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I pulled the trigger at the red line. I almost got stopped out, then price went in my direction, it came to 2 pips from my TP. Then it reversed to BE lol so I closed at BE. I would never allow a trade which is 2 pips from my TP to reverse for a loss, such an outcome would be very difficult to handle psychologically.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
i am in this trade. see in the first pic what i see with the chart at default. I need to change the scale like in the second chart to see the two lines at the same time

--- 帖子 #527 ---
i putted manually the vertical lines and trendlines, the EA did not recognize it.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Yeah, the peaks don't match up. Looks like divergence to me though.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
how is going the new indicator? Do you think is possible a change to make the lines appears close to the line of the base chart?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Unfortunatelly I haven't had much time to work on it. In a couple weeks I'm rolling out a new packaging system in multiple locations across the U.S. for the client I work for (they manufacture cabinet doors). Anyway, it's been pretty hectic getting everything tested and making sure all the programs are bug free. There is something that I noticed recently with the Overlay that i'll have to fix since EURUSD is reaching higher than it has in a long time. You may have noticed it move up or down a bit when refreshing it after leaving it for a while. For now you can try lowering the "Offset" property, but be sure to do this in both the indicator and the EA. I should be able to find some spare time once we get the new system through QA (Quality Assurance).

--- 帖子 #531 ---
thanks LucidObscury. I am anxiously waiting for the new indicator. i will try to lower the offset again but last time i did not see any difference (making the change in both indicator and expert) and i wish you good luck with your other bussiness.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hmm. It definatelly makes a difference. Remember, Indicator property changes often do not take affect until you "Close" the "Indicators List". Thanks for the well wishes.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Do you know how to do that? Place your mouse cursor on the price axis on the right, click and drag. Also you may need to re-draw the chart. Cycle timeframes, etc.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Yes, indicators re-draw when the timeframe changes or when properties have changed, but not while the "indicators list" is still open. BTW, I'm pretty much done with the changes to the overlay. I completely re-wrote it so it now has nothing in common with the "OverLayChart..." indicators. I took a different approach to positioning it on the screen, so it should always be close to the primary symbol at the right side of the chart. It still strays as you move farther left into history. I also added an option to scale the movement by the value of one pip in the deposit currency instead of both pair drawing relatively pip for pip. I need to test this a bit, but right now it's showing that for 1 mini-lot, 1 pip of EURUSD is $1 (USD) and 1 pip of USDCHF is a little over $0.97. Does that sound right? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
@Lucid: Which indi is that exactly? Posted on which date?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
If you're looking for the Overlay indicator you can use the attachments link at the top right of the page and grab the most recent version. I haven't relase the one that scales by value yet. I want to make sure the values are correct. Here's the formula I use the scale the movement of the SMA in the unreleased version, but only if the option is set to true: PipsRatio = (MarketInfo(SubSymbol,MODE_TICKVALUE) / MarketInfo(SubSymbol,MODE_TICKSIZE)) / (MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_TICKVALUE) / MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_TICKSIZE));

--- 帖子 #537 ---
OK, I've played around with a few pip calculators and these values do seem to be correct. Once the market starts moving so I can make sure the indicator doesn't redraw in any undesireable way I'll post it. It will still be a little while before I get the divergence EA and this indicator merged into a single indicator since I've got a couple bugs to sort out in the EA logic.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Got it! Look forward to seeing the newest version....

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hey guys. I'm really fighting with the missing candle issue. I didn't have the problem on the 15M+ timeframes, but I took a look at the 5M and the issue is very prevelant. I've tried deleting my data and refreshing (from the broker), but no luck getting those candles filled in. I think this happens when your broker had no ticks come through for that whole period of time, so they just don't store any data for that candle. I really want to come up with a solution to this before I release anything.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Lucid, In every case of the missing candle, I have found that there is no gap on the actual chart of the overlayed pair. Let me try to explain it this way. If you compare the overlayed USDCHF with an original chart of USDCHF, they will not match. You will see the shift occurring due to missing bars on the overlay. The bars are not missing on the USDCHF chart.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
This makes sense since when you drop the overlay of USDCHF on a USDCHF chart they are both missing that candle, so everything lines up. The problem comes in when EURUSD has that candle, but USDCHF does not. On the 5M chart I have lots of missing candles. I can scroll through my history center and since every other row is gray I can remember that the gray rows end in a 5 for instance. As I click through I can find where all the sudden the gray rows are ending in 0. I can then find the candle which is missing. If you hover over that area on your chart you will see that the candle is missing on the chart too. I have to find a way to compensate for that when dealing with two different pairs, but it's proven quite tricky. Don't get me wrong, I will solve this, but it's taking longer than I had hoped. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
In fact, now that I think of it, this is really quite bad functionality by metatrader. It should know better since a missing candle will throw off all period based indicators. If it's true that there were literally zero ticks durring that period then we should get a flat line, not a missing candle. If instead it's just corrupt data from the broker, then I guess metatrader isn't to blame, but it still wreaks havock on period based calculations.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Ah Ha! I think I just got an idea. I'm going to do what metatrader should be doing for me. I'll copy the whole candle array into a new one and everytime I come across a missing candle I'll use the close price of the previous candle to create a flat candle with no wick. Bingo. Thanks for helping to salt my brainstorm.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
That's good thinking, Lucid. I KNEW you would figure it out...

--- 帖子 #545 ---
thanks Billbss for sharing this system. Very interesting indeed! All I've done is added the overlay chart in the below pic. Is this what we're looking for? 1st trade would short the green line (EJ). 2nd trade would have shorted GJ (orange) ?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
billbss first of all thank you for sharing your method. I looked at it and back tested it and it really looks great. Here is a screenshot for e/u and g/u pairs. I would like to know if I am at the right track. As you can see that there are divergence between the 2 pairs and looks of it e/u made h/h and g/u didn't so this means that g/u will be shorted here. After carefully looked at the g/u pair the chart showed me other clues as well, you will notice that the price did hit 61.8 fib level, another clue is that it is also hitting a resistance trend line, another one is that a support line that was brocken now it is becoming a res line which all are indicated with black circles. I am still waiting for the price to hit the trend line around 1.6430-6440 area, then it would be a great trade to take. But I just want to know if I have the idea with the divergence method that you have explained here. Thanks

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Iam short on the above example at 6400 with 2 orders, TP1 at 50 pips and TP2 50pips, I also saw other divergence like u/j and e/j and usd/cad and usd/chf, but didn't had as many reasons for an entry as this example does.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I guess I am on the right track since I got my 50 pips. from now on I will only go with one order. Here is another trade that I took u/cad and u/chf, gave me almost double of ATR 14*2 which I had 1-2 risk ratio on that one.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I did backtesting on this system, now the higher the time frame the more pips you can take. For now I only took 50-60 pips but with 1 hour timeframe you could go up to 200-300 pips. Slowly I will adjust to that, or may be enter with 2 orders and close the first order with certain amount of pips and continue with the 2nd order untill 200-300 pips and as you go along you could also move your SL to book the pips. Just a thought, I still have to back test how to handle the TPs SLs and get max out of this great strategy.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
You've got the right idea. What you are doing is different than I do. eu and gu are not correlated enough to use my system. I have not found any two pairs that are usable, other that eu and uchf. If you look at the two charts you posted, they do not even look the same. There are only spots that imply any correlation. Without the two pairs looking almost identical (as eu and uchf do) deviations are meaningless. Having said that, don't stop what you are doing. It may be you are on to something much better than this system. If it is profitable, it is right.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hello all, I'll use for the analysis the first graphic in the thread which contains eur/jpy and gbp/jpy. So, the point is that if eur/jpy makes a new high and gbp/jpy fails to make a new high, then sell gbp/jpy. The first point, eurjpy makes a new high: this means that euro is stronger, and jpy is weaker and weaker. On the other hand, gbpjpy fails on making a new high: this means that yen is not so weak vs gbp. Or, looking it in a different way, gbp has become weaker. Therefore it seems reasonable that gbpjpy will fall a bit more. Nothing new so far. Now, what about the third leg of this table? eur/gbp. I have not seen the graphics yet, but as soon as i get home I'll do. What I would expect to see is eur/gbp falling more pips than gbp/jpy. Am I right? In a few hours I'll know. Nice trading.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
hi, thanks for your reply, I shorted the g/u again today after it went up north after my first trade, it gave me another 87 pips. so far what I am doing it working fine. But I willalso try e/u and u/chf pairs as well.... so this made 3 in a row... I will post a screenshot tonight for that trade. Before I was trading with the 2-5 breakout strategy and it was a good strategy but the timing was not great for me, this is a great strategy. I will post daily with my trades as long as it works

--- 帖子 #553 ---
You are right in your analysis.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
billbss I forgot to mention that the e/u and g/u pairs I figured out that both pairs will usually go to the same direction and one makes the h/h and the other doesn't then when both pairs make their way to the same direction then take the trade, I don't know if that makes any sence or not. I did the back testing on both pairs and analysed it and I am confi enough to take the trades live now with smaller lots for now, but eventually will increase the lots as I go long with it.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Okay. If it works- go for it.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Euro buy early this morning, easily hit 2x ATR profit level. There's been a bit of a drought for these trades lately, but that's fine by me as long as it's still profitable

--- 帖子 #557 ---
hi, I also downloaded the overlay indi which is called the overlaychart.mg4 and I have changed it to ex4 and applyed it to my chart but nothing shows... do you know what I need to do for it to show? thanks

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Here is another one that I got this morning around 9am. I got the 100 pips and I am out. The rally is still going, because it was with 15min I exited earlier. This makes it 5 in a row, hopefully it will continue....

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Euro buy on the 1hr. 58 pip TP/SL. Edit for clarity: I'm talking about the one at 1500 hours on the 25th.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
many waves between your trade. I believe it is a no-trade for billbs.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Point taken. Had I actually been trading these, I think this euro sell would have taken me out of the 1500 hours trade at break even.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
How about this euro sell? It looks strange. Would it be a no-trade because the pairs didn't mimick each other one-for-one? I.e. U/C bar to bar went lower, higher, higher, where as E/U went lower lower higher? edit: this trade hit profit

--- 帖子 #563 ---
It's a good sell setup.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi there Bill, I followed along when you first started with this thread but got distracted with one of my 9000 other projects. Anyway I'm back and I just wanted to catch up with the state of the art with your technique, so here are some questions: 1) Early on you said you traded H4 and H1 timeframes. Do you still favor these or do you trade others as well? I saw a few 15M posts from you. 2) Early on you proposed an ATRx2 SL and TP which I rather liked myself (I swing trade stocks this way). You said that maybe there's a better method for SL/TP. Has there been any change with SL/TP from the ATRx2 method? 3) I recall a rule you added where you didn't want any extra dips between the highs and lows you were comparing for divergence. I searched for this rule but couldn't find it; could you do a refresher on this "extra dip" rule please? I'm glad to see you're still hanging in there with this thread and method. I appreciate it and it tells me your method has promise.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Euro buy this morning would have been stopped out for a loss.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
U/C sell on the 30m. Going towards profit but not there yet. edit: this trade hit profit.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I trade anything from 15M to 4H. I fan through the TFs and look for setups. I'm still using the 2xATR. Later in the thread, I suggested trading only divergences that had no extra peaks or valleys. The others work fine. I said that to try to make detecting them easier.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
OK, so divergences with extra wiggles in between are fair game then as long as there are prominent swing lows and highs. A couple of observations: The EA in the thread seems interesting but I think it may filter out valid tradable divergences. Also the original OverLayChartLINE.mq4 indicator seems to be better at scaling among the various time frames than the Overlay.ex4 indicator.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
The extra wiggles are fine if you want to trade them. The definition given in the thread is without the wiggles.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
OK, here's a trade I'm currently in. E/U made a lower low, but the inverse of U/C didn't so go long the inverse of U/C (i.e. go short U/C). Entered at 1.0394. SL 1.0445, TP 1.0344 http://i36.tinypic.com/34zd9iv.jpg

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Target hit +50 pips. I'm likin' this.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
U/C sell hit profit on the 15m. The trade also appeared on the 30m, but you would still be waiting for profit there. If you trade fixed lots, I guess you would want to take trades on the higher timeframes to capture more pips; however, if you trade fixed fractional lots, I would think you'd want to get in and out as quick as possible, therefore trading the shortest TF. Edit: oops, this is the same trade steve just posted.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
I took a tally of the trades I've posted so far (beginning 9/10), and it looks like 7 winners, 2 losers, and two trades consisting of a break-even (entered, then got a signal the other way, would have gotten out at BE or close enough). Small sample size still, but pretty sweet! As technology advances and the market gains more participants, do you think divergence of highly correlated pairs will eventually disappear, or will it become more prominent? Or will it stay the same, as one of those "always has been, always will be" kind of things?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
I'd read somewhere that the well-known correlation between EURUSD and USDCHF is due to similarities between the fundamentals of the EU and Swiss economies. So in relation to each other (i.e. EURCHF) their currencies are quite range bound. If the fundamentals of the EU and Swiss economies start to diverge, the correlation between EURUSD and USDCHF will decrease. This argument applies to EURJPY and CHFJPY for instance. Their correlation on the daily time frame is in the 90's. I guess these pairs aren't as liquid as the classic one in this thread so don't get as much attention. I guess what I'm saying is that the correlation won't be taken down by currency traders but through fundamental changes in the Swiss and European economies. I'm an engineer, not an economist so take all this with a grain of salt.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Divergence on M15. Short EU 1.4552, SL=1.4587, TP=1.4517

--- 帖子 #576 ---
That will be a trade, but the entrance bar hasn't completed yet. Your chart doesn't look right. How do you have the EURUSD line graph set up?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
All I did was change the chart type to line. Was there something else in the chart properties? Also, the rightmost peaks in my divergences were complete and I waited for price action to start moving in my direction. Should I have waited for the next bar to complete as well?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Yes. You should have waited for the next bar to complete. At least that's how I do it. Do whatever works for you. On the chart- put a simple MA - 1 period- Typical price. Go to options and set the color of the line chart to "None". Now when you switch to "Line" only the MA will be there representing the EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
OK, the chart is set up like yours. Actually the raw price line and the 1 period MA look almost the same. So just to clarify. If I get two closed bars that show divergence, I wait for the next bar after that to close. If it closes in my direction, then I enter. Correct? The way I played it was to wait until price moved in my direction but I didn't wait for the bar to close. Once I'm in the trade I manage it pretty actively but moving the stop to technical turning points as things unfold.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
The two lines look close but there is a difference. I've spent quite a bit of chart time proving to myself the MA typical price works better than the close. The closing price is very one dimensional. The typical price also takes in the range of the bar. I wait for a close (both pairs) in the direction of the trade. Many times if you enter in mid bar, price will turn on you and it winds up not being a divergence. Also, the trade you entered ended in a long bar- it was about twice the range of the 14ATR. I enter trades like that but I do it at a reduced lot size. They almost always retrace. This one looks good so far.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Luckily for me the trade is moving in my favor anyway LOL. My aggressive stop management has moved the stop to breakeven so at least I'm not worried about it now. I'll start waiting for the close and see how it goes. It makes sense since it improves your odds for a successful trade. The downside is you get in later, but hey this is trading.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Which part is the "long bar"?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
The bar that should have been the entrance bar. The one after the last peak of the divergence.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Here's an interesting situation: Divergence leads to a sell on E/U 30m (first attachment), then an hour later, you get a sell on the U/C 1h (second attachment). If you had taken both trades, would you have prematurely closed the E/U once you took the U/C trade, or just let them both run their course? edit: these might have been a bit of a wild ride, but they both closed out in 2X ATR profit.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Both of those are sell signals for the same pair- the aqua line- I presume that is EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
They both look like EU sells to me too.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Sorry if I've confused you guys with my color schemes, but they are indeed two different pairs. The first chart is a 30m euro chart with U/C overlayed, and the second chart is a 1h swiss chart with E/U overlayed. Check the top left of the charts. The aqua lines are the MAs, and the purple and red lines are the overlays.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Finally got out at +20 pips on that trade. I tightened up the stop and was stopped out finally.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Another one. This time the bar after the rightmost valley had closed.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi stevegee, What indicator do you use? Mine OverLayChartLine tells me the setup is not valid because the bottom of valleys are not lined up. But it seems to be valid for you. Thanks. http://i33.tinypic.com/2is1u1.gif

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Same indicator as you OverLayChartLINE. I guess you're right that the valleys don't line up exactly. Maybe it wasn't a good trade. The EA couldn't find it either.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
It's a very close call. Playing around with timeframes could help to take a decision. Here's what my vertical bars of my previous picture look like on an 1hr TF. The signal is clear. http://i36.tinypic.com/2yxlrhs.gif

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I'm trading this strategy with real money, but with micro-lots. I hate paper trading and learn better if I have real money on the line, even if it's only 50 cents LOL. In the higher timeframes, the ATR is of course much larger so my max risk is bigger than my tolerance in this learning phase. I've been only taking signals off the M15. I still look for signals on the higher timeframes, but don't trade them.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
U/C sell (first attachment) appeared on the 30m before the huge bar today on the 1h (second attachment). 30m trade hit profit within half an hour. I think bill would approach the second setup with reduced lot size, which is most likely the prudent thing to do. Note that since these trades were in the same direction as one of the ones I posted yesterday (you can still see it in the second chart, although the trend lines are messed up) it didn't really matter. Had they been opposite, I might have just closed the previous trade out and not made a new entry.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Haha. I saw that setup this morning but I was too scared to take it! These MT4 brokers are bandits during NFP.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Ah, I guess I wouldn't know. I only trade on a weekly time frame right now, and my broker is Oanda . I mean of course I've heard about it; I just don't have first hand experience.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hey nice method , i just wanted to ask if you are taking right now Divergence with wiggles in the valleys or not ? because in the chart you have attached there are some wiggles that confused me a little. i read the thread from the beginning and finally catched up with you guys so next week im going to try this on a demo to get a feeling for it. thx.. and have a good weekend. /edit i have attached a chart can you please tell me if everything looks fine with the overlaying etc. i made this with sma - 1 typical , just want to get sure that it looks right thanks. bold`= eurusd http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/8500/pic10.gif

I asked Bill to clarify on the "in between wiggles" rule a couple of days ago. It really isn't a hard-and-fast rule, it's just to make the divergences easier to see. If you think about it, if you have a divergence with wiggles in between on one time frame, it'll be a divergence with no wiggles on a higher time frame. Get in the habit of scanning the M15 through H4 time frames regularly to get a feel for it. This takes lots of screen time.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hey Bill, I can't think of a reason why this wouldn't work with other correlated markets. For instance ES/YM (index futures), or maybe 2 liquid stocks in the same sector like Exxon and BP. I put ES and YM on the same chart on Friday to watch them but they're so perfectly correlated that there weren't any divergences.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I've never looked at them. You might try the NASDQ amd mini Russell. I haven't found any other forex pairs that are correlated enough. You might also try things like soy beans vs oil vs meal.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
My position on the 'wiggles': if the wiggles are correlated, go for it. What is the market trying to tell us? If you see something that makes you think twice, but you still think you know, then go ahead and pull the trigger. You will find out if you were right or wrong in judging what the market was saying, and the sum of these experiences will help you to become a better chartist. Enough zen talk for now I agree.

I just finished with a visual back test of August 09, where I only traded the hours of midnight-noon, EST. I didn't trade any 'flat' divergences. I scanned through the month on the 15 minute time frame, glancing at the 1 hour every now and then. I then scanned through the month on the 1 hour time frame. I don't really feel I missed anything by not scanning the 30m -- who knows. I allowed all valid entries, even if it doubled my risk at the time. In the event of a close call on SL/TP, I allowed room for the spread, but I think this was only an issue on two trades. 14 wins 7 losses 1 trade reversed for break even (trade triggered, entered, another triggered for opposite direction on the same pair. If you would have ignored the second one, the first would have been a winner) If you would have traded at 3% account equity per trade, your account would have grown by 22.2% (less spread and swap) If you would have traded at 2% account equity per trade, your account would have grown by 14.5% (less spread and swap) If you would have traded fixed lots, you would have gained 178 pips (less spread)

U/C buy on the 15m with ATRx2 = 22 pips. edit: this trade stopped out for a loss.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
i took this trade too

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I can't edit my old post, but the U/C sell on the 1h marked on the October 2nd chart as 20091002 @ 15:00 resulted in a winner.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Euro buy on the 30m. Almost stopped out but still hanging in there. edit: after almost being stopped out again, it hit profit.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
there is a shot on EURUSD right now. 15 min EDIT. billbs, you will never look at S&amp;R with this method? Because with this setup for example, we are fading a breakout with good momentum. another question, you are not trading 5 min anymore? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
i hope lucid came back with a new indicator. The biggest barrier for test this method now is the indicator. Changing scale untill se the two line together make the lines almost flat, it is a pain.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
For the record, I'm only trading between GMT 0100-1300, as this would be the time frame in the future i'm willing to be available for trading Attached a winning U/C buy earlier this morning. 5 decimal places makes it a tough call as to when you would consider it higher low/lower high. I rounded the values of the E/U MA on an E/U chart, and there was a one pip difference so I counted it (the U/C higher low was obvious, the E/U lower low was arguable).

--- 帖子 #611 ---
U/C 1hr buy for a loss. Entry bar was huge, not sure what you'd want to do with it.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I never look at SR. With this method, if we worried about SR, pivots, % of daily range etc.. we would wind up with one trade a month and it would probably lose.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I wouldn't have taken that trade even with a normal bar. Look at the aqua pair. You can't draw a trendline connecting the two vallies without hitting the middle wave.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Quick visual check of early September 09 combined with the results I had posted so far in the thread led me to these stats (could be off by one or two, but I hope not) 9 wins 4 losses 2 trades combined for BE (one entered, got a signal for the opposite direction, so I got out of the first at BE or close enough)

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I agree, and I went back and forth with myself over whether or not it should be a valid trade. I probably won't trade these in the future.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Euro buy this morning; hit profit.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Just did a visual backtest of July (1h, 30m, and 15m timeframes, only taking trades between 06:00-18:00 GMT -- totally misspoke earlier in the thread and said 0100-1300 GMT, but I meant EST) and came out with: 13 wins 7 losses 1 trade reversed with an opposite signal. if you would have exited, you would have lost 7 pips on the original trade, or 1/4 of the 2xATR value. If you would not have exited, it would have been a losing trade. Had to give up 4 or 5 trades that were just outside the time rules, mostly around the 19:00-20:00 hour mark. IIRC the win/loss ratio was about the same, if not a little better. Nobody is perfect, so there isn't really a way to know if these would have been actual trade results or not. Not to mention slippage/not getting TP orders filled when you normally think they would. If I combine my july, august, and september visual backtest results, and discard the BE trades (anyone have a better idea of what to do with them to bring them into the analysis?), I get a record of 37 (W)-18 (L), or a win rate of 67%. Is there a way to calculate expected account size if you trade fixed fractional MM and know your expectancy? You can't just multiply your expectancy by the number of trades can you? If I do that, I get different numbers than if I simulate a running total of my trades in a spreadsheet. Can't you simulate approximate account balance with the following? start balance = 100 balance after win = previous balance * 1.03 (3% risk/trade) balance after loss = previous balance * 0.97 (again, 3% risk) since multiplication is commutitive, order of trades does not matter Inserted Code Start 100 Win 103 W 106.09 W 109.27 W 112.55 W 115.93 W 119.41 W 122.99 W 126.68 W 130.48 Loss 126.56 L 122.77 L 119.08 L 115.51 End 115.51

--- 帖子 #618 ---
i have a dumb thought. hope you guys help to clear it. why not long both when you long the one doesn't make a lower low? it seems to me all the successful trades you guys posted could be 2X more profitable if you trade both pairs. i hope the profit is not due to recent ranging conditions.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
No. The key principle to this system is that you buy the relatively stronger pair or sell the relatively weaker pair. When a divergence occurs, what's really happening is the 2 pairs (which are normally correlated) are going out of correlation. So when the pairs go out of whack, you buy the suddenly stronger one or sell the suddenly weaker one. They will eventually revert to being correlated, but you'll be out of the trade by then. To express it another way, if a pair makes a lower low then it's weak, right? Why would you buy it? But because the other pair failed to make a lower low it's stronger than the one that made the LL, so that's the one you'd buy logically. The same logic applies to a sell decision. If a pair makes a higher high, then it's strong. So why would you sell it if it's strong? But the other pair failed to make a HH, so it's weak. Logically you'd sell the weak pair, not the strong one.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi guys, Just sifted through most of the thread and thought I'd get involved. Probably an obvious answer but has anyone looked at taking ATR x3 for TP? I always feel more comfortable with systems that reward more than they risk. I expect the success rate would drop but would it drop enough to make it invalid? Or trying 1.5x ATR for SL?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
From the testing I've done by hand, I think 2XATR is a pretty good sweet spot. I think 1.5xATR for SL might be ok, but like you said, it will change your win %. Which one gives you better expectancy is the real question.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hand tested June across 15m, 30m, 1h time frames only trading between 0700-1900 GMT. It got pretty complicated, and wasn't as good of a month as others, but there were still more winners than losers. Since there were more "reverse for partial win/loss" trades for June than anything I've tested so far, I included them in the results: 13 wins (12 for full profit) or 56.5% 10 losses (8 for full loss) or 43.5% average win was 96% of the full 2xATR average loss was 86% of the full 2xATR These June stats combined for an expectancy of 0.167. Other months I've tested so far: Inserted Code June 0.167 July 0.300 August 0.364 September 0.133 Trading 3% of your account per trade for June led to an 11.2% account increase. May and April are next if this indicator cooperates, and it will be interesting to compare my results to people who already posted those results in this thread. edit: had to update September's numbers after looking over the 30m for more trades. Performance was worse, so I hope I didn't double count anything. 10-7 with 1 winner being a 'reverse' and subsequently only 1/4 of the 2xATR.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Missed posting this U/C sell for a loss on Friday.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
There was a 15M Long on the EU at 0745 GMT that hit profit, if you trade wiggles. There is a long UC in progress now, that is close to profit. No losers unless I overlooked one.

Lots of flat spots on my charts instead of swing lows/highs, or peaks not matching up. I'm using Alpari-US demo for my feed, what about you? I did see this E/U buy that squeaked in on the 1h today though and hit profit.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Euro buy this morning on the 30m hit profit. Bunch of things JUST squeaking in or JUST not being valid recently, makes me uneasy. Maybe it's been that way the whole time and I haven't really thought about the impact that much? edit: Now that I think about it, I KNOW it's been that way, and will continue to be. I guess counting trades as winners instead of "no trade" when close calls is just what bugs me, and I'll get over it. No voodoo here. Trade what you see; stick to your rules (even if that means counting one pip differences on a stupid 6 significant figure broker and having to round: i.e. low #1 = 1.48881 = 1.4888 and higher low = 1.48886 = 1.4889).

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Pretty clear buy on the euro this morning that closed for profit.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
cosgrove, where you enter the trade? Billbs said early in this thread that he wait price to came in your direction and that any amount is good. This is a point i still have difficult. Normally with this kind of strategy people wait the broke if the "point 2". using Lucidobscure EA one will enter on the open of the second bar after the signal, meaning that if the signal is at 14:45 the entry is at 16:15. and you? What was used in your backtest? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Is it safe to use this in m15 timeframe?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
I am basing my entries off of the close of the bar where we get our first confirmation of the MAs in our direction. See the attached picture, where you would have opened your trade upon the closing of the bar marked in dark blue (Broker time 15:00 [GMT+7]) at a price of 1.4882. I am also using the ATR of this bar (21 in this case) for the 2xATR TP and SL. Your profit would have hit 42 pips later at 1.4924. I'm not sure why your times were off so much (14:45 to 16:15)...maybe a typo on your part? I really don't mean to be rude, but the only way to answer your question, iamnoel, is to back test it yourself the way you would trade it and look at the results.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Chock up another October win in the form of a U/C buy on the 15m. You could have picked an earlier swing low to draw the lines from in this chart, but I just went with the simplest one.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi, I am using IBFX demo feed. No trade was signalled on 15 min chart.Seems to be large discrepancy are you using Alpari?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Yes, I'm using Alpari's US demo. Care to post a chart?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Thanks for your reply. I downloaded Alpari to check out discrepancy. Could you try using EURUSD as base and overlay USDCHF on your chart and see if you get same signal.I have tried this and seems to look different,maybe indicator is giving errors.What indicator version are you using? I am not sure how to post chart using IBFX feed maybe somebody else could take alook?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Doesn't IBFX use metatrader as well? Then posting a chart is the same as always? The signal showed up just fine when I used E/U as the base pair (see attachment). Cycle your time frames a few times to see if that clears it up. My indicator has "OverLay Chart.mq4 Ver.1.10" in the header, but the filename is actually OverLayChartLINE.mq4, and was uploaded to the thread on Apr 13, 2009 7:50pm

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Thanks for your reply. My error i can now see the signal on IBFX. Happy days

--- 帖子 #638 ---
The 'missing candle' issue with the OverlayChartLINE indicator is really bugging me, because I'd really like to backtest more, but I can't due to chart shift and peaks subsequently not matching up where they should. I'd rather not try anyway due to the much higher probability of error/missing something. How's it coming Lucid? I'm more interested in the indicator alone if you already have it fixed and could upload a new version? Many thanks. edit: interim solution is to just add a flat bar in the history center where it's missing.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
a new indicator to show correlation using Ma. But i think will have the same problema of overlay with scale. i will try it this week

--- 帖子 #640 ---
giraia_br, it wasn't obvious what that indicator did besides draw a 13 period MA on the chart -- can you elaborate at all please? maybe post a chart?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Nice Trades, Cosgrove. Thanks for keep your efforts. Remember a few days ago you explained to me why we should buy the strong of two, or sell the weak of two? However, you see, this trade you made is successful, but why not trade uchf and eu simultaneously? if trade both pairs, it'd turned out good profit, right? i understand your explaination last time, however, what do you think of my thought below: when a divergence happens (e.g. eu make a lower low, but uchf NOT), that might indicate a insufficient momentum going down because they are not both going down truly (to form a lower low). therefore, going down is fake and weak ---&gt; it should go up --&gt; now that they are correlated, if you long one, you should long the other too. Did you look back what if you trade both pairs for these trades you made? Cos to me, most of your charts posted showed good trades if we trade both pairs, double profit of trading only one.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
blue line: EURUSD 15 min (SMA TP,1 of course) aqua line: USDCHF 15 min yellow line: EURUSD 60 min red line: USDCHF 60 min you can't invert USDCHF with this indicator, but at least you can add 15 min, 60 min, etc to the same chart. Needs to get used to see correlation with USDCHF not inverted.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Someone made the case against trading both pairs at once not too long ago...check back a few pages and you might find it.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
using only 1 time frame: edit:use method 5 to have typical price. And period 1 of course.

I'm trying to do the correlation thing between EURUSD and EURCHF using overlay indicator as shown below. How do I line up the two charts properly? http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b2...orrelation.jpg

if you will not use EURCHF, do not use mirroring, set it to false.

This is the result with mirroring off http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b2...rrelation2.jpg

--- 帖子 #648 ---
If the markets aren't correlated that much (which is true in the case of EURUSD and EURCHF), you will find your chart to be a mess. The recommendation is to use EURUSD and USDCHF. (set your subsymbol to USDCHF in the indicator properties if you're placing it on an EURUSD chart, and vise-versa)

--- 帖子 #649 ---
U/C sell stopped out by 1 pip before swinging hard into what would have been profit c'est la vie! I know it sounds silly, but someone double check me on this just to make sure... If you're looking at a bid chart (metatrader default), you sell at the price shown. So, in this example on Alpari-US demo charts, you would have sold at 1.0188, and set your stop loss to 1.0202 (ATR of 7, so SL set 14 pips higher). Well, I'm using the typical Oanda spread on Monday morning (2 pips) to calculate, and my bid chart showed price going to a high of 1.0201 -- meaning I would have been stopped out when my bid chart showed 1.0200, and the broker would have filled my buy order at 1.0202 (bid+2 pips spread) correct? That's how I've been tracking close calls and determining win/loss; you never know when you're going to get filled though, and I can't think of a better way to do it. I'm just trying to stay consistent.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
But according to billbss' first post, you can trade EURUSD - EURCHF, can't you?

--- 帖子 #651 ---
My manual back testing of May is complete and was ridiculous by my own standards set so far -- came out with 20 wins and 16 losses, with one of those losses only being 21% of a normal loss (trade was closed via an opposite signal). This corresponds to an expectancy of 0.134, and if you risked 3% equity/trade with these numbers, you would have ended up with a return of 13.7% for the month. May's results added into my logs brings them close to 118 trades across 5 months, with a 60% win rate and a 93% rate of return risking 3% equity/trade (breakevens not included, how would you factor them in and calculate win/loss percentage with them?). October isn't over yet, but by my records so far, it is going better than average. One thing to note is that I have failed to account for spread in all of my profit and expectancy calculations so far, even though I have used it when determining win/loss on a "close call" trade during back testing. I will take a look at my logs and see if there's an easy way to calculate it in.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Bill has posted that the E/U and U/CHF combo is the best for this method so far, and I think he said he no longer looks for trades with any other combos. Makes sense to me, but I think a key in this decision is the fact that the euro and swissy are correlated so close pretty much all of the time. If you want to check the mataf charts on correlation and track a pair combo for a limited amount of time while the combo is highly correlated, I'm sure you would get good results. But for now, I'm trying to "KISS".

--- 帖子 #653 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #654 ---
The typical spreads for fixed-spread brokers are really quite steep: EU is 2 and UC is 4. It truly does need to be accounted for, and it's a significant part of the normal targets for this system. Say you make 40 pips on a UC trade; you're giving up 10% in spread costs! A certain controversial poster on various boards contends that fixed-spread brokers are basically crooks. He pushes using ECN brokers instead. The broker I use for stocks, options and futures is an ECN for forex. The spreads are microscopic compared to the bucket shops.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
there was 3 trades today. I took only this trade that happened right now that obviously hit profit:

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I disagree. If you make 40 pips on a trade, you make 40 pips. You don't give back anything. You put 40 pips in your pocket. If you lose 40, you lose 40- not 42 or 43 or 44- you lose 40. Where the spread gets you is in making it harder to hit TP and easier to hit SL. Assuming a 2 pip spread, if I enter a trade and place a 20 pip TP and a 20 pip SL, price must move 22 pips to hit my TP an only 18 pips to hit SL. It has changed the odds to favor the broker.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Thanks for clearing this up Bill! I had a really long post debating the pros and cons of it, but I think when I start doing this with real money, I'll do it your way. This definitely calls for double checking my close call trades though.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
That's what you need to check. The spread may have caused you not to hit the TP when it looks like you did, or caused you to hit the SL when it looks like you didn't.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Check out this smorgasbord of trades this morning. Not really sure what I would have done. None of them canceled each other out, so unless you have a "max open risk" value in your trading plan, take them all? Total of 3 wins 2 losses. Second trade on the U/C was really close though, who knows what would have really happened. Some of these trades also appeared on the 30m, but they appeared on the 15m first, and were as close to the same trade as you could get, so I didn't bother counting the 30m ones. edit: I'm starting to think that all "close calls" should be counted as a loss...

--- 帖子 #660 ---
We may actually agree but are just looking at the same thing from different viewpoints. Certainly you'd agree that a smaller spread is better since it tips the odds more in your favor. I'd rather pay 0.5 pip than 2 on a spread.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Sure. I've never traded ECN forex, but I have traded futures. The commission isn't bad but the slippage is very bad. I suspect you have the same problem with ECN forex.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
You don't need to guess. You can tell exactly if a trade would have hit profit or not.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
So should we compute expectancy with both methods of including/excluding spread: more winners, but less per win vs. less winners, but more per win? Think you'd come out the same profit wise in the end?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
So in your experience, have your orders always been filled to the pip? I.e. chart shows a swing high at 1.1000, your order was at 1.1000, and you were always (or 99% of the time, whatever) filled?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I know when I'm about to enter a trade. I watch the second hand and hit the button at the open of the bar. If I miss it by a pip or two, I assume I got in on the open, and set my TP and SL to the actual open. Sometimes the slippage works in our favor, sometimes not. It balances out.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Sorry Bill I should have been more clear -- I was wondering about your experience with TP/SL orders being filled once price on the chart hits your TP/SL level? Slippage on the order is to be expected; however, what I wouldn't expect was that if I had a TP at 1.1000, price got to that level on the chart, and my order just sat there on the books unfilled at all...can you comment on your experience when it comes to things like that? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I've never had that happen in 4 years of trading forex. It happens almost every trade, trading futures.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
well, i have a FXDD account (free $100 account they gave last year) and today trading another method i got stopped by 1 pip. See in your chart last high. At FXDD it is at 91.06, but at IBFX is 91.05. so, simple broker difference.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
i still have difficult to backtest, because i don't know where would be my entry. today my entry was somewhere in the bar BEFORE this highlighted bar. So it was wrong?

Hi All, Is there a way to attach a simple moving average to pippafets second chart indicator? I can attach one to the main chart but not the one underneath it. His indicator is at page 21 post No 314 Or if i can't do that could i make the candles in the indicator chart show a line chart instead. Thanks

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I believe if you have the mt4 navigator window open (side panel on the left), you can drill down into the indicators and try to drag the moving average entry over to your data window...I've seen it done before but I can't remember exactly how to do it if that doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
These picky ones just make me mad. No trade, because while the second lower high on the euro (aqua line) looked like a mini swing high on the chart, it was actually flat compared to the point next to it after rounding of the values to 4 digits after the decimal. Also, you have to go look at the actual MA on the USD/CHF to see that it's a higher high (or actually a lower low, since it's inverted). IMO, the pipettes would lower the signal-to-noise ratio of the system, so that's why I round.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi billbss What if one pair makes higher low and the other does not, should you sell the pair that does not? And if one pair makes lower high and the other does not, should you buy the pair that does not?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
In this correlation trade. If I have it right you buy the one that didn'nt make the lower low. This is contra indicated for a correlation trade, in that you should buy the one that made thew lower low if it is the GBP because the GBP moves lower and makes higher highs. Yes, you made money but if you look at the trades you will see that if you bought the GBP instead of the EUR you would have made more money. The ATR's of the GBP would be larger. I know because I made money on that trade. Peace.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
What you did on one trade doesn't matter much. I'll stick with what I've been saying.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
What I did on any trade doesn't matter. However, if you go to the correlation history of the Euro vs GBP it is a fact that the GBP moves lower and has higher peaks. Absolutely keep doing what you have been doing. Just look at your trade and when they line up and you execute your trade look at the GBP and see how much more it made. Thats the facts.

With the 1 period MA on typical price and everything? Your reasoning doesn't hold any water if someone is trading with fixed fractional money management.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
No. Regardless which pair you trade, your TP will equal your SL. If you size your trades properly, you will make the same percentage of your account on either pair. I have found that the higher low or the lower high, hit the TP more often than the other pair does.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
billbs, as for your rules, this is correct? Do you consider this bar as a confirmation? This is 1 hour chart, take this trade basing in price action was un-resistible.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I don't see a divergence.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
looking now i see the second top on EUR was 1 bar later than the top on the inverted UC. the second top on UC was not lower but equal. Even this was a reason for do not trade?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
The two peaks being equal is okay. One being a bar later than the other is not okay.

U/C buy for a loss this morning. October is 14-8 so far by my records

--- 帖子 #690 ---
This E/U buy trade was off by a bar on the 1h, but lined up as a larger pattern on the 30m. In progress, but on a Friday afternoon, might have to hold it over the weekend. I don't know if I would do that with only a 42 pip SL...seems a gap against you could do some serious damage you wouldn't expect?

--- 帖子 #691 ---
I never hold a trade over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
U/C buy on the last bar I would consider looking at for the day @ 19:00. In progress. I probably wouldn't hold over the weekend either if I were trading real money, which makes me wonder when I would close them out, or if I would even take Friday afternoon trades at all?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi, traders! This is my 1st post on FF. I hope, it will be useful. I created expert for billbss's method. See attachment. Algorithms used: - find 2 peaks (or valleys) without any mini-peaks (valleys) between them - open buy or sell with SL = TP = ATR*2 Backtesting not so beautiful as desired (I used M15 for EURUSD vs USDCHF from 1st June to Today) But this version is draft. So, may be a bugs here. PS. Expert is autonomical and very fast -- it don't require any custon indicators. PPS. As you know, Metatrader Tester can't do multicurrency backtesting. So, if you test on EURUSD, then deals on other pair will be ignored.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi All I ran into this thread 2 days ago and just finished surfing thru it. I trade emini futures but I do monitor FX on a daily basis, so I am very familiar with the pairs discussed about in here. I too use strategies that are based on divergences - more complex types too - and will give you my 2 cents. First of all, I interpret divergence as a Temporary Market Inefficiency . Big institutions have algos and systems based on exploiting those inefficiencies, that's why they tend to work. However, I don't believe that trading divergences alone is the smart way to go or build a profitable system. With this I don't mean to bash the over 40 pages that have been written in this thread. Not at all. You guys have come a long way and what you have done is a wonderful job. Bill, you had a tremendous intuition and my hat goes off to you. Now the big question is: provided that divergences "tend" to work and provide an edge better than a coin toss, you got to use this edge as a basis to build something upon if you want to maximize its potential. According to my experience, divergences are a great ENTRY tool. That's about it. If you want to take this further, you got to develop CONTEXTUALITY . S/R levels are important because if you believe that one of those tiny divergences is the REAL CAUSE of a 100pip move you are utterly wrong! The tiny divergence may be what triggers the move within a larger context. If you plan on keeping this a mechanical system, then you can't expect much better results than a 55% win rate. If you want to take this further, then you have the possibility to make serious bucks and develop a profitable strategy - not system - It's all up to you and where you want to go from here.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I pretty much agree with you. I stated a number of pages back that this system, is slightly better than a coin toss. That is, however, significant. It means it can be improved on, as it heralds a move in the predicted direction, more often than not. I don't agree with you about S/R levels. I have found them to be subjective. Five different analysts will come up with five different sets of S/R levels. They will contradict each other and they all think theirs are correct.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Thanks for your advice, ItalianSharp! Help me open up my mind here a little bit...are you suggesting that we should manage trades with more discretion? I.e. be able to know which ones to hold for profit longer than 2xATR, or cut our losses shorter than 2xATR? Or were you suggesting an idea much bigger than that?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Bill, I understand that your goal is to keep this system as mechanical as possible in order to reduce subjectivity to almost zero. And I agree with you on this because I am a very rule-oriented trader too and I prefer to have everything lined out in front of me before I make any trading decision. In fact, whenever I take trades that slightly step out of my trading plan or miss a couple of rules, I tend to struggle psychologically because my confidence level is not the same. So even winning trades that I take using my discretion are not as good as they could be. With that said, I strongly believe you got to develop a set of rules to determine in what context you are taking the divergence setup. S/R levels can be discretionary but some are very common levels that everyone can see. Prior low/high of the day is a level everyone pays attention to. Prior open/close too. You can extent the same to weekly/monthly levels as well. These are KEY AREAS all traders pay attention to, don't you agree? If you trade intraday, then you got to develop a set of rules to identify intraday S/R levels. Who cares if others may agree/disagree with your S/R levels. Didn't you develop rules to identify clear hills/valleys? And do you think the way you define hill/valley is the same as every other trader? No way. And you shouldn't even care about it. What matters the most is that you got rules to define everything. It takes lots of work and patience, but it's possible. Now you may ask me: how do I know what are going to be the key S/R levels for the day? And how do I update the S/R levels during the day? Since I am a big fan of logic and simplicity, I'll say that a key S/R level is an area from which the market made a clear visible move. I'd call Support any level from which the market bounced convincingly and Resistance any level from which the market retraced convincingly. You got to develop rules to define "convincingly" of course. Once you have a set of rules to define S/R levels, then you can draw them on your charts and closely monitor price action as soon as those zones are tested. If there is anything that I've learned about the markets - any market indeed - is that they love to test those S/R levels over and over again. The biggest moves and nicest moves always occur at key S/R levels. Why? Simply because those are the levels where the biggest battles between bulls/bears take place, because the biggest volumes occur at those levels, and once either side is defeated the market will quickly run to the next level and start another battle. Rarely do we see markets slicing thru S/R levels unless the move is news driven and there is a MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL reason driving the market a certain direction. Once you develop a way to define/identify S/R levels, I'd recommend you also develop a set of rules to determine whether the market is trending, ranging, or reversing. It is my personal preference to avoid all countertrend trades simply because I am not interested in catching tops/bottoms. I prefer to leave that tough task to someone else with bigger pockets than mine. I patiently wait for the market to show me a bottom and reverse, and only then join the new trend by buying/selling the obvious retracement. That is when markets trend and reverse. When markets range, then there is no trend or reversal so you either play the range or sit out until the market breaks out either way. I don't mean to give a TA lesson in here because this is your thread and you are the boss. I am only trying to help because I am a big believer in divergences and you've shown good intuition and skill to get this going. Now it's time to move on and make it a VERY PROFITABLE strategy. You can do it but you must add a few things into the mix. Leaving it the way it is now is a shame. I bet you that most of the losing trades will either be countertrend or outside any meaningful S/R level. Kind regards IS

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Well, trade management only scratches the surface of what I am referring to. It's about understanding the context in which you take any trade that can make a big difference. There only are three types of trades that I know of: countertrend, with-the-trend, trend reversal. The best trades are with-the-trend and reversal trades - beginning of the new trend - I am not good with countertrend trades and, honestly, I am not even interested in them. Too much work and sweat. I prefer to leave those to other traders. If you take one of the divergence trades described in this thread without being aware of what context the setup appears in, then you are trading blindfolded. It's like driving a car in the dark with the lights turned off. So if you guys want to take this strategy further and make it VERY PROFITABLE , you got to work on different things. As I said earlier, the divergence is what triggers a move not the cause of the move.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Whew! Just finished reading the thread and setting up the template. Looks very interesting. Simple but powerful. I like the use of divergence coupled with correlation. Will forward test this week. It's clear, a lot of hard work by dedicated people went into originating (Billbss) and enhancing this system. Before I get started, could someone please explain how to draw the shortened trendlines that appear on a lot of the charts to highlight the divergences on both pairs? I am with IBFX. Many thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Go into the properties of the trendline after you create it and un-check the "Ray" box on the parameters tab. You only have to do this once, and all subsequent trend lines should be "point to point."

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Well said, IS! Div tells us "where/when", the context (SRs etc) tells us "why". If there is no strong reason (Why), then div (where/when) is less relevant (and more likely to fail).

--- 帖子 #702 ---
The trade @17:30 broker time last friday stopped out for a loss before the weekend, and I'm looking into recalculating all of my trade win/loss back test statistics without trading on Friday afternoons/holding over the weekend. If my to-be sleep schedule would mandate that I not be awake at market close, and my broker (still haven't figured out who to go live with yet) did not support closing trades during the weekend, then I would have to close open trades on Fridays before going to sleep. SO, if I'm going to sleep immediately after trading, then I must close all Friday trades by ~1pm EST. Sorry if I treat the thread more like a trading journal sometimes edit: the trade I originally posted in this post wasn't a trade, because one of the swing highs was really 'flat' after rounding off the 6th significant digit on price -- oops!

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Bill - surely no slippage trading EC (euro) futures ? I've never not been filled using limit and stop limit oders @ 4 lots ($500k). I understand SF is less liquid, but having looked at it just now, ie. during the more liquid US session, it looks like there's always at least 2 or 3 contracts available with a 1 pip spread, usually more. I'd also take ECN Forex over a "normal" retail fx broker anyday. Apologies if I'm missing your point. Anyway, thank-you for this thread which I bookmarked at the outset. I have not followed it closely but I really like the idea, especially using very simple line charts. Thanks .

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I traded mini S&amp;P, mini Russell and mini Dow. They are more liquid that and other futures I know of. I don't remember ever being filled on the first thrust on a limit order. Invariably it took one or two excursions to get filled. I have no idea how ECN forex performs.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I appreciate your thoughts. I'm sure the system can be improved on. I've maintained that for a long time. I have to disagree that S/R is they way to improve it.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Is there any logical reason you don't think S/R levels can provide any help? In your prior posts you claimed that S/R levels can be too subjective and that if you pick 10 different traders, they'll all use different S/R levels. However, don't you think that if you ask the same 10 traders to identify hills/valleys, they'll likely disagree on that as well? What I am trying to get at is that if you are looking for something that is widely recognized by everyone, then good luck. Even the most mechanical strategy is very subjective. It may not be subjective in its application, but it's very subjective in its rules. Perhaps I misunderstood your explanations. I am looking forward to reading how you believe this can be improved. IS

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Yes I do think S/R levels are too subjective. No I do not think that recognizing the hills and valleys is subjective, if the rules are followed. I don't know how else to answer you. If you want to use S/R - go for it. I don't.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
indeed, i am excited and awaken in reading this. that's like you are hosting a roulette table in fx market. :-) i'm wondering, if anyone has thought about this: this divergence will be more significant if the more volatile pair show weakness? e.g. eurjpy and gbpjpy, eurjpy is LL, but gbpjpy, more frenzy, is NOT making a LL. Will that make a better divergence for LONG trade? this actually happened today. let's see if gbpjpy is crazy up tonight/tomorrow. even if it does, this might not be of significance anyway. just my guess.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Anything better than a coin toss is profitable, with a 1:1 RR ratio, which this uses. Roulette isn't better than a coin toss, it's worse.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
ha, i meant, u r hosting a roulette; but what do you think of my said "volatile pair making lower high/higher low means more significance for the set-up"?

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I don't know. It's worth watching.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
i am not an expert neither i trade profitable so maybe i am wrong. but the point is: billbs showed here, like all threads he participes , a very objetive way to trading. billbs threads are the contrary of the majority of threads here wich are "eye opener" and that the creator of the thread "is on something" and all this bullshit that after 175 pages only two persons were in the first page too. All others were in the beginning broke they account or never found a way to start to trade. This is because if you search for everything you will find nothing. the approaches used to recognize if price is trending i am aware are or too much subjetive, or too much complex or simple inefficients. if you use down theory expecting only higher lows to buy you will make 3 trades for year. Same with the 21 bars used by Joe Ross. I doubt a backtest could show this system more profitable using thinks like this with the great reduction of frequency it will cause. if you use your 5 year soon to recognize if price is trending or not, after 7 losers you will wonder if you zoomed enough to show the chart before request the kid analysis. another ways i know are very complex like Mark Fisher number line. Quant analysis are difficult to have acess (never found an indicator for this methdo for example) and based a daily tf, so again you will reduce frequency too much. Cosgrove made a backtest with this system and got something like ~10% montlhy and 67% hit rate. Did you backtest with objective rules and got something much better than it? you have objetive and well difined rules to use as a filter like billbs gave for the entries i am all ears. thanks in advance.

Italian Sharp was put on ignore yesterday, so he can't respond. I did it because I felt he was being argumentative and I didn't have time to argue with him, particularly then. That's the first time I've ever done that, and I admit, I was too hasty. That should be reserved for name calling and incivility- which he did not do. Sharp- If you read this, I'm taking you off of ignore. You are free to post here if you want. I apologize for my hastiness. I won't respond to you, because I have said all I can say on the matter, but you are welcome post if you want.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
I think if you could statistically prove that one pair wins more often (or put another way: divergence on a certain pair of a certain pairing more often than not signals a significant move in a certain direction) than it's counter pair (i.e. if E/U won more than U/C when they were paired looking for divergence), you could exploit the fact. However, my slightly educated guess is that you will probably find in the long run that neither pair "leads" the other, or that if one does, the edge is too small to capitalize on.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Thanks for the mention giraia, but I must update the numbers in an effort to be transparent (no fault of yours, it's been a while since I posted them). I'm seeing more like 60-62% winners now with my subjective ruleset. And again I must make a note that the ~10%/mo. is from risking 3%/trade. I am about to modify the rules again regarding trading on Fridays, but that will most likely not happen until this weekend.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Euro sell for profit this morning. The overlay saw a higher high by 1 pip, but the actual U/C was flat. I am counting the trade anyway, because of it being a more simple analysis to not check the opposite chart. I may be trading off of "fake" signals, but like rounding off pipettes, I feel any differences in return between the two options would be like splitting hairs and is akin to different broker price feeds showing different signals among traders trading the same system. I feel it will all balance out in the end.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
another cool entry/trade, this signal is not fake at all. i always feel that when we manually trade, we should not be too 'mechanic' yesterday, eurusd, and eurjpy presented "waterfall" on daily scale, so at the end of day, you see a weak eur's lower high, that should be a quite vaild signal for sell, just my feeling :-) btw, Cos, did you enter using a sell-stop at 1.48600 approximately? many thanks.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I tend to agree; however, I feel we need to have some rules so that we do not end up contradicting ourselves or not knowing why we traded a certain way. The entry bar closed at 1.4858 on my chart. I guess it's a personal preference as to whether you would enter with a market or limit order. Since I am not taking these signals live yet, I don't know which I would use.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
U/C sell during lunch...missed profit by 1 pip so far on my charts, so still open. edit: this closed for profit

Hi guys, im a follower of this thread, but I have an observation which is weird... but learning forex we learn to use candlesticks and are steered away from "line" because the candelstick shows more info. I just think that without all the noise on the line chart we can better see where the price is going and can probably create or improve existing strategies,,Am I the only one thinking this??

--- 帖子 #724 ---
sorry, could not resist.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Are you saying you agree with leaving candlesticks off of the chart, or are you trying to put them back on the chart? I'm not going to tell you what you can and cannot post in the thread, but I don't believe Bill had discretionary rules based on candlestick patterns in mind when he started this.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
he said "that without all the noise on the line chart we can better see where the price is going and can probably create or improve existing strategies". Then he said if he was the only one wich had this idea. there is a member at Forexfactory.com that had this idea and opened a thread about it, his nickname is billbs and this is the thread.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I may be wrong, but I think he's saying candles would be better for this than the line charts, I use.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Final trading day in October, let's see what happens! U/C sell on the 30m. 2xATR = 38 pips edit: stopped out -- chart updated.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
I assume you got stopped out. On the 15m there was a sell eur/usd, not sure if you noticed that.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
The U/C overlay didn't make a higher high on my chart, so I didn't count it as a trade.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Late in the day U/C sell. I'm logging it for tracking purposes, but when I start live, I don't know if I would take such a late trade on Friday just to have to wake up and close it out ~4 hours later.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Marking the last trade as a 12 pip loss, as that was the P/L level at the close yesterday. That brings my October records to 16-11 (59% winners, average win = 1, average loss = 0.922), with three of the losses as partial losses (closed early due to weekend). Expectancy was 0.217 and monthly return when using fixed fractional MM of 3% yielded 17.8%. The equity curve looks like shark teeth. Again, my back testing/trading style is as follows: I trade only between the hours of 0600-1800 GMT I take trades on 15m, 30m, 60m time frames If I receive an opposite signal for a pair where I have an open trade, I close the current trade but do not enter a new one I do not hold trades over the weekend I am allowed to have as many open positions as my risk tolerance and margin requirements allow (I will have to double check this later for that day with like 5 trades to see which were open at the same time -- YMMV) I round the pipettes to 4 figures after the decimal Call them filters if you want, but I think they just make sense.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
I just finished my testing for April, and that means I finally have something to compare my back test data to: Bill's data from that quote was through the 17th. My results for that time period were 14-3. The total of April returned results of 21-8. This corresponds to a win rate of 72.4% and expectancy of 0.448.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
First trade of November is a winner.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
i am extremally pissed off because i was watching this trade live and did not take this. did you take this trade at the small bar with yellow arrow or 2 bars before? thanks for sharing your charts and tests.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
I've noticed for a few trades that Cos you often took these very "fast" set-up. "fast" means that the setup from beginning to end is very short, say only 1 or 2 hours, that makes the setup less significant. Considering the setup is formed near the end of day(i see it is close the vertical dash line?), it is even less significant. On the other hand, to me, the white line and circles demonstrate a far more significant set up with larger price movement. and two possible entry levels indicated by blue lines. my 1 cent tho.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hi Charvo, Thank you for your suggestions. I guess I haven't said it before, but I am testing this system as mechanically as possible, with my steadfast rules already being posted. This means I'm trading every divergence that falls into those rules, no matter the amount of time it took the setup to form, or whether or not it's at the beginning or end of the time limit/on a Friday (just so long as it is within the limits!), etc. I'm not trading live yet, so a careful analysis of these trades and those rules will follow my data gathering, and I can guarantee you that my rules will change before I stick my neck out there. If my analysis concludes that "fast" trades are significantly less profitable than "slow" trades, then I will either approach them with a smaller position size, or I will not trade them at all. (Here's an idea: what if you had a position size algorithm that was not only based on your SL, but also the size of the pattern?) I will only do this after hard statistical evidence shows the way. As for your suggested trade, the valleys on the left side do not line up, so I did not count it as a trade (I'm pretty sure this is an original stipulation of Bill's from day 1). Yes, it is divergence, and yes, if you traded it you most likely would have made money; however, if I count it in my trade statistics, then I must also look back over all of the other divergences that weren't quite lined up and see how they turned out. I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible right now. To be clear, the trade was at GMT 13:00, with my own "end of day" being GMT 18:00. The white vertical dash lines are simply markers to the entry bar of the trade. I'm sorry that they are in the same style as the period dividers in MT4, but I have those turned off

--- 帖子 #738 ---
The "wiggles" on this one are pretty correlated, so I wouldn't feel bad taking it as a trade; however, an eventual thorough review of all trades will be the deciding factor.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Artov caught a trade that I missed, so here are the updated October statistics: 16-12 (57% winners, average win = 1, average loss = 0.93) Expectancy of 0.167 FF MM of 3% got you 14.3% yield on the month

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi, Cos, thanks for your inputs. I'm not native speaker, so not quite sure about "line up", what's that? I thought that only watching for higher high and lower low......

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Maybe this quote from bill will help In general, the swing high or swing low must happen at the same time, but on the chart you posted the first swing lows do not happen at the same time. The E/U low happened at 04:30, and the U/C low happened at 05:00.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
15, 30 and 60 or only 15? Or with 4h too? thanks again for sharing.

two trades today. I did not take these.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
I wouldn't have either, as they fall into "off hours" of the market, where the signal-to-noise ratio is lower (and where I will be doing other things with my life besides trading) I've attached a 30m E/U buy that squeaked in after rounding pipettes. Would have been a winner.

Euro buy at the end of the "day" edit: stopped out for a full loss.

well, looks like markets heard you. took a USDCHF short now on 30 min. EDIT: stopped out. Went to about 95% of the target depending of your soread.

15m EDIT: closed for profit.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
1 hour too. Took it again.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
i am aways trying to see if there are S&amp;R that could help to optimize entries and exits. But evrerytime you can found "strong" S&amp;R around ATR x 2. For example, the target of this 1h trade now is not the bottom but is the lowest close of this down move.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
The left side peaks do not match up, so I would not have taken it.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Euro buy and sell on the 15m both would have closed for profit. The stops were pretty narrow (14 and 20 on my charts). Giraia, I think you already posted the one marked at 12:30 in my chart.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
While I would not trade that signal off of the 15 minute chart (you're right, the pattern is a little big), I would look for an entry signal on a higher time frame chart, like the 1h or 4h. I didn't see one on those TFs that corresponded to your setup though.

hi cosgrove thanks for the reply, the div was very clear on the 1h time frame infact thinking about it any larger divergence spotted on small time frames will always be valid as it's not divergency from an indicator (that would change relative to tf) it's pa its-self which is obviously constant. anyway i've attached the chart in the 1h regards ic

has anybody tried e/u-aud/u-nzd/u - usd/chf??? this week 4 trades all good, but take trade only when 2 charts agree! btw does anybody know how to backtest it with to charts involve? i know that in vhandtrade it can't be done! thanks in advance

This guy just squeaked in. Counter trend small pattern 15m setup. This is totally a side note, but I think it would be fun if one wore a heart rate monitor and looked at its graph over time during a trader's trading session edit: this hit profit

strange, this setup wasn't on my ibfx platform. data feed problems?

It's not a problem so much as just different. Alpari will show setups that IBFX won't, and vice versa.

I wouldn't have taken this based on the fact that it was outside of my trading hours as well as 2 hours before the Friday close (I don't hold over the weekend with such small stops dictating large position size).

Could someone please add a moving average to the price differance indicator I think it would be helpfull to see a bigging and end of a trend

--- 帖子 #781 ---
i think you could drag a moving average holdinh CTRL to the Pricediff subwindow, no?

--- 帖子 #782 ---
No, because both the E/U and U/C are flat on the left when you look at the pip values. There is no 'peak'.

Euro buy on the 1h. edit: stopped out

--- 帖子 #785 ---
I finished my March testing last night, and it was a real mess. I ended up with 52 trades: 21 wins, 23 losses, with the remainder break even. Average loss was 85% of the average win. This resulted in an expectancy of 0.033. Bill's results were Interesting how he had more trades in March than I did, but I had more trades in April than he did. I'm not too worried about it, and I will double check my results eventually.

I think there were a few trades over the US Thanksgiving holiday, but I didn't track them or include them in the back/forward test because I won't be trading that holiday in the future when I go live. A triplet of trades this morning, two Euro sells were open when a Euro buy came up (I would have just closed the open trades, NOT stop and reverse), would have been an 8 pip loss (24% of a full loss) on the first, and 15 pip loss (34% of a full loss) on the second. The 0900 trade is on the 30m because the peak that appears on the 15 is actually flat.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Oops! Another one in there too, U/C sell for a loss.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
That wraps up a quiet November for my stats, 6 wins 7 losses, with average loss being 70% of the average win. Expectancy was 0.087, and trading 3%/trade would have net you 2.9% return on the month. It is worthy to note that this is a circumstance where trading less % risk per trade would have left you with a greater return at the end of the month. Kelly Criterion in action!

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hey guys. I have to appologize for being gone so long, but I got busy and then was kind of burnt out on metatrader programming. Anyway, here are the new files. As a quick refresher, the Overlay is an indicator and the "Correlating Pair Divergence..." is an EA. I've modified the Overlay completely so it now bases everything on the current difference between prices (either by value in account currency or by pips). What this means is the Overlay should always be close to the chart line towards the right side of the chart, but may stray as you move further left. Also both will redraw at the start of each candle. This will keep everything matching up between the two. The Overlay also no longer prints the current candle, but that doesn't matter for this strategy. Oh, I also added correlation percentage feature to the EA. It will display the current correlation between the two pairs (in the bottom left corner) for two customizable periods (# of candles) as well as the difference between the two percentages. This means you won't have to visit any websites to find out the current correlation. BTW: this uses pearson's correlation algorithm. I'll be paying attention now, so please let me know if you see anything funny. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I forgot to explain one of the options on the Overlay indicator. UseValue (true/false) This defines whether the indicator will draw itself using the relative value of the chart symbol vs. the sub-symbol or, if set to false, will just use pips. What this means is if you set this to true and the sub-symbol moves, say, 10 pips in typical price between two candles, but the value of those 10 pips (in your account currency) equates to only 9 pips on your primary chart pair, then the line will only move 9 pips from one candle to the next. If you set this to false then 1 pip movement on the sub-symbol will correspond to 1 pip on the primary symbol.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I haven't really used your stuff in the past Lucid, but I'll give it a try soon. Two E/U buys resulted in wins this morning.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Congratulations on your wins. I'm not sure if either of those buys really adhere to the method as originally laid out by Bill though. The top chart looks like divergence, but there is a lot of noise in between the lows. I think Bill would usually trade these, but mention they are outside of the system. The bottom chart fits pretty well with the rules, except the trend is moving up, which means you would be looking for higher highs. Anyway, my point is that the signal I produced would not have called either of those buys, though it would have called the sell in the first chart. Keep making that money!

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Thank you, Lucid!!! It's appreciated

--- 帖子 #795 ---
You're welcome. Quick question Bill: Do you pay attention to trend? I see quite a few trades in this thread where a higher high is compared to a lower high while the trend is moving down. When I set the TrendDistanceCandles property in my indicator to 0 I see a lot of signals, but the quality of the signals is poor. I seem to get better results with this value around 30 or so. I'd love to get your opinion on this. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
I have never paid attention to trend, but I am prepared to if it is profitable. The problem I've had with trends is an objective way of determining them.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I know exactly what you mean. I guess the question I have is really: When looking at a higher high, if the price was even higher just 4 or 5 candles ago, is it really a higher high? It would be higher than the previous peak, but if the peak before that was higher than both then can the first peak even be called a "high" for the next peak to be a valid "higher high" There's an example attached. When looking at the second peak (where the red line starts) can that really be called a "high"? And if it's not a valid "high" then can the third peak (where the red line ends) be called a "higher high". I don't mean to get too specific here, but I see this a lot and it seems to give more false signals than anything else. This is why the signal specifies a tred distance of 30 candles. This means that when looking for a higher high, none of the last 30 candles can have been higher than that. Thanks for you insight on this.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
I see what you mean and it's an excellent observation on your part. I have never thought about it that way. The main thing is- if it works, it works. Let me look at it- I think you may have found something good

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Yes, these are the "wiggles" that we were talking about earlier in the thread I think. I think I share Bill's sentiments on this. And as he said, I would love to hear anyone's take on determining trend. Thanks for the words of encouragement though! I do admit that I'm not trading with real money yet; that will start next year. As for the trades, I have adapted the system a little bit to suit my personality and how I hope to be trading it in the future, and I've tried to make that clear recently (not trying to dig on you for missing it, just reiterating it). My results working like this so far are littered throughout the thread, and I hope to post more soon. [I know I wasn't asked, but my two cents follow!] IMO both are "valid" (because they're really just the same trade) and it doesn't really matter. Personally I draw the trade on the smaller pattern out of habit. Just don't ever intersect the chart line with your trend lines.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Yeah, I've still got a few pages to read since I left. I'll be sure to check out the variations which have been working for you. In the end, if makes money then it's exactly what we're after. I have to agree with both of you on trend. If there were a way to know then we'd all be rich. Since I'm a programmer I'm big on backtesting, which I know is not quite the same as forward, but It allows me to quickly reject strategies that I come up with or come across which don't hold muster. Also, it's easy to visually backtest a poor system and "see" it as being successful. Unfortunatelly I can't backtest this one since Metatrader only simulates one pair at a time. I'll start forward testing probably tomorrow. I plan on playing around with some settings in my EA which will either consider trend or ignore it and see how that goes. BTW, I know you're not (yet?) using the signal I created, but the "SpikeMinPips" value, if increased will cause it to find divergence despite "noise" between peaks or valleys. The "trend" mechanism can be turned off by setting the "TrendDistanceCandles" to 0. Thanks for your 2 cents. Always appreciated.

At first glance on the 15 minute OHLC chart, it looks like this trade could have gone to a win; however, looking at the 1m OHLC chart, you will see that it swung to a loss before swinging to what would have been profit.

I don't see any valid trades in your chart. For the possible trade on 12/17 with peaks corresponding at 10:00 and 13:00, the overlay line looks flat (I don't recommend taking trades when the divergence isn't 100% clear, but you can do what you like.)

From the lines you drew, it's not a trade. They both made higher highs. If you look slightly more left, you will see peaks, that when connected to the right side peaks you have, the green line will form a lower high, with the red line a higher high. If the green line is your MA line, then short it. If it is the overlay, buy it (it helps to just switch to another chart with the MA/overlay switched to verify what to do).

You read the chart correctly, but made the wrong call. You should have sold E/U according to this strategy. Just remember: "Buy strength, sell weakness." Strength = making a higher low than the other pair Weakness = making a lower high than the other pair

Really? How did I manage that? I started this thread the day before he started his. Not to mention the two methods aren't even similar.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
So sorry! He started the day after you! The simularity I see is in identifying divergence and the corralation of pairs I know there is no hedging here and I know that style will get you into some large DD I know this is a simple system but diffucult till it kicks in for me at least Looking at the chart is like trying to read a letter backward while looking at it in a mirror i guess I asked cosgrove a question would you mind ansewing too?

Cosgrove has posted his backtest results.

I'm taking the occasional trade live with a small account, but the vast majority of what I post are "paper" trades after the fact. As bill said, most of my 2009 results are in this thread. Click my post count to see all of my posts. My December results were great until the last day of trading (23rd for me, and I imagine that will be so every year), where I had 4 losses. I ended up with 9 wins, 8 losses, gain of 2.26% if you were trading 3%/trade. Average monthly gain for 2009 was 12.8%/month if you were trading 3%/trade, and while there were a few months with close to 0% gain, there were no losing months.* I counted somewhere around 318 "signals" for 2009. I say signals, because that includes trades where I closed an open buy when a sell came up, etc. Win rate of 57%, expectancy of 0.14. *I have not double checked these results trade-by-trade yet .

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I'm having serious issues fixing missing bar problems (cause of "overlay shift" when back testing) using mt4 and windows 7. I think it has something to do with the user account control permissions. I've tried different things like turning UAC off/running mt4 in admin mode/importing fresh data, but I can't get "history center" changes to stick. I had a similar problem in Vista for a while. Unless someone knows how to get around this, I do not recommend trying to back test on windows 7.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Short on the E/U nice dip on E/U made a few pips the sell U/C was an experiment gone bad

--- 帖子 #840 ---
I would have most likely ignored the second setup coming right after the first on the U/C buys. Also attached is an E/U buy loss. Counting these as 1 win 1 loss. There were a few other setups today that didn't make the 1 pip difference rule.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
What is that "1 pip diff. rule"?

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Quick explanation of "1 pip difference": This method is centered around the concept of a "higher high" on one pair (example, U/C) vs. a "lower high" on the matching pair (example, E/U), or a higher low vs. lower low. Sometimes when you look at a chart, you will think there is a higher high/lower high by visual inspection; however, if you were to look in the "data window" of mt4, you would see the values are really equal. Example: you look at the chart, and your U/C overlay looks like it made a higher high, while the E/U MA looks like it made a lower high. In this example, you would want to sell E/U short. You decide you want to double check and look at the actual values for the highs on both pairs, and you find that while the second U/C peak looks higher, it is indeed the same value as the first peak. This would rule out the trade for me, as it is not technically a " higher high," as it needs to be higher by at least 1 pip to be a valid trade. Sorry I can't post a chart right now, having data issues

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Thanks for making the 1 pip clear I'm realy getting into this style of trading I'm new to it and experimenting but I was 8 wins 0 losses this week Maybe mostly luck but I hope some thought and skill was invoulved lol Thanks Bill for this method I still get confussed at times about the lower high and higher low One question I do have is Do the rules stay the same no matter if the pair is negatively corralated or non negative corralated

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Oops, I should have clarified that my last post is only valid when the overlay is inverted (which is how it looks in my charts), due to U/C and E/U being negatively correlated. dryclean, how have you been taking profits? 2xATR or what?

--- 帖子 #845 ---
I've been using an EA called e-trailing. I have it attached I have the EA set for a 100 TS with a 30 step. I'm playing off the 15m TF. If I'm in profit by 40 pips (5 didget broker) I will check the 1m and 5 min TF If I get a feeling it's gonna turn I'll set a TS of 30. Not using the ATR I might do better using the ATR but I'm just trying to get a feel for correct entries I'm a pig not a hog Pigs get fat Hogs get slaughtered

[quote=cosgrove;3353828]Oops, I should have clarified that my last post is only valid when the overlay is inverted (which is how it looks in my charts), due to U/C and E/U being negatively correlated. So the rules DO stay the same no matter if the pair is negatively corralated or non negative corralated

--- 帖子 #847 ---
The idea of divergence stays the same no matter what you're trading. It just gets tricky to talk about it when things are inversely correlated. I don't know about the rest of you guys, but a pip to me is 0.0001 on a USD based pair, or 0.01 on a JPY based pair...let's try to keep the discussion that way unless I've been out of the loop and the FX community has changed the definition...

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Big mess this morning. Would have resulted in four transactions for me: buy (09:45), cover (11:30), buy (12:30), cover (14:45). Net loss of ~half a position. There was a buy signal on the U/C 1h at 13:00, but I think the 30m signal at 12:30 took precedence and was really the same pattern (so no reason to double up). I will record this as two losses, and their small size will show up in the expectancy result.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
I hate it when this happens (trades at 1745 and 1800). Would have lost about a quarter position.

For some reason I stayed out of everything this am. Nothing caught my eye

Pair of E/U trades offset for a loss of ~1/3 a position, and a U/C sell for a win. The triple bottom on the 30m E/U MA is hard to ignore, especially with the U/C being divergent at the same time.

Do what you like, but I would advise against trading in the "off hours" with low volume/"signal-to-noise". Also, you don't have matching peaks/valleys in that chart, which is one criteria that I think most people in the thread are concentrating on.

E/U buy on the 15m triggered same time as the 60m, so I took the 15m trade to be in/out quicker. Covered with an opposite signal a short while later, for no gain/loss. U/C sell 15 minutes after the cover was a winner. I'm thinking about not letting lower time frame trades cancel out higher time frame trades. I'm also thinking about these "small crappy divergences" and not taking them. I'll look into both once I have all of 2008 tested (time goal: end of the month).

--- 帖子 #862 ---
I'm playing with a 200 SMA and RSI=2, OB=80, OS=20 in the 15TF and the 60TF for OB OS and buying if above the 200 and OS or selling if below 200 and OB

What does that have to do with this method? Are you only taking trades when divergences appear in that zone?

When a chart is saying something like this We are buying E/U because it made a higher low while U/C made a lower low . The E/U is showing strength, so we buy it. I just want to confirm the sma and rsi are with me. I said I was just playing with it not saying it is what should be done Do you feel it has no relavance with this system?

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I wasn't trying to imply anything, I just wanted more clarification in what you were suggesting, if you were suggesting something at all? I like to keep things simple, so I prefer to keep indicators and filters at a minimum, unless they increase performance or reduce draw down without a doubt.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
for example in your last posted chart you would have done a U/C sell If U/C was over the 200 SMA (trend up) and the RSI was OS&lt;20(oversold already) I might look at it harder or pass on it and look for something better I get your point about to many indi's and such a person gets thinking too much and everything becomes a mess I'm just trying it out it may mean a lot of work for nothing

Has anyone done any testing in 2008 yet? I'm seeing negative expectancy for July and August, positive expectancy for September, October, November, December. I have yet to test earlier than that.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
I did some backtesting a while ago, forgot to post the results. I have backtested 1 May 2009 - 20 October 2009. Max drawdown during the backtest period is 10%, reached on June 11th. P/L at the end of the backtesting period +30%. Conclusion for the 6 month backtest period: Overall it is profitable, but there will be some negative months which can be frustrating. Feel free to adjust initial capital and risk % per trade to suit your money management.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Interesting stats, thanks a lot for sharing!

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Thanks for your post artov, I was just about to PM you. If you ever get into 2008, I would love to share notes.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
These backtests confirm what I concluded several months ago. This is one of the rare mechanical systems that is profitable. It may be the only one we'll ever see. It is also one I would not trade. I would not trade a system that shows a negative month. This method is a framework for a very profitable system. Anytime the basic method exceeds the expectation of random entries, it can be improved upon. I'm open to suggestions, particularly from Cosgrove and Artov and Lucid, who have worked with it.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
watching this system on 1m it looks profitable, maybe even more than in higher TFs. Reason i have ti believe in that: the time window to take benefit of the inneficience is small and trying on higher TFs the inefficience is gone. the indicator don't make it easy to backtest, so did not do it. And the signals of the indicator/EA are not the same one should take using naked eyes. but still a mechanical method wich works.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Thanks. I invite suggestions from you, also. This is something to look at.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
from my experience it's impossible to use divergence to trade on it's own.

No I sold E/U where I have the yellow line I beleive where you have the cricle would have been a sell for U/C.... Yes? If I'm wrong I'll scream LOL

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Both pairs are making new highs where you have the yellow line though, and you don't even have a second peak formed yet...that's why I am confused as to what you are trying to point out. The pink circle looks like it would have been a U/C sell, yes. But remember, when you switch to the U/C chart, it would actually be a buy (because of the negative correlation).

--- 帖子 #889 ---
You are helping me a ton but I need to go back and re- re re read the thread.. For what it's worth I've been over 90% in winning trades. But I still have trouble grasping the rules Thanks for all your help

--- 帖子 #890 ---
If you're hitting 90%, write down your version of the rules and we'll all use them.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
The problem is I might be reading the divergence 90% wrong and I'm really only 10% right LOL Below is a link to what I'm doing http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...93#post3399193

I'd love to hear: What are your average win and loss sizes? What is your average stop loss size in pips? How many trades have you taken this month? Why are you using 15/60/240 and not 30/60/240 or 15/30/60?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
1 I'm using .01 sometimes .25 but my goal is win percentage If I were live I'd go .1 lots or account balance /25000 2 SL is 100 TP I use e-trailing ea set to 100TS with a trail step50 (5 digits broker) sometimes I'll adjust the TS to ATR*2 I also adjust the SL I look at the RSI and the x-meter S&amp;R Fibs 3. 28 trades I attached a graph...disregard the big gain I placed an order and my son exited the program I turned it on the next day and I was up over 2000 pips . I reset my demo account cause it was screwing up my analysis. 4 I'm using 3 x my lowest TF mine is TF15. TF 5 may give headfakes. 15 and 30 are pretty much the same so 15 H1 and H4. When I place an order First On a long, buy the pair that did not make the new low. On the short, sell the pair that did not make the new high To confirm: I look at the RSI(2) of 15 H1 H4 for OB or OS should all be the same Then I check the xmeter for the strength of the currency Then I check if it is over or under the SMA 200 on the highest TF used. Sometimes if it looks good I'll go for it and disregard the SMA I know what I'm doing is against what Bill wanted in his first post. NO INDIES I don't want any EAs or indicators or filters. This one will stand on its own but he also said This is one of the rare mechanical systems that is profitable. It may be the only one we'll ever see. It is also one I would not trade. I would not trade a system that shows a negative month. This method is a framework for a very profitable system. Anytime the basic method exceeds the expectation of random entries, it can be improved upon. I'm open to suggestions, particularly from Cosgrove and Artov and Lucid, who have worked with it. These are not my own ideas but bits and pieces from some of the other threads I follow. I buy no means recommend this it works for me right now in demo I have not backtested it. I don't think I can with these indies. But it looks promising and is technically sound. This whole thing could crap out down the road who knows. Keep what you like and pitch the rest I'm still struggling with the On a long, buy the pair that did not make the new low. On the short, sell the pair that did not make the new high. Thanks to Cosgroves help I might get it figured out Hope I answered your questions

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Thanks for your long and detailed answer! I must point out that you cannot ignore average win and loss size when determining the strength of a system. If they are roughly the same (as bill originally suggested) then that's fine and you can concentrate on win/loss %. I just wanted to clarify. The idea of "congruence" -- waiting for more than one indicator to say the same thing -- is a nice idea with this system, but I'm afraid that you may filter out lots of trades. Even with a 90% win rate you can only exploit leverage so much, and your total return may be lower. Something to think about...

--- 帖子 #895 ---
This is true. Over time if I do maintain a high win percentage I could increase my lot size to 5.0 LOL

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Sorry, I meant relative lot size. For example, if you win 90% of the time, but your losers are 10x as big as your winners, you will not be profitable in the long run (unless it is by pure luck). That said, if you truly had a 90% winning system, it looks like you could generate a pretty nice equity curve even if your average win was 1/5 of your average loss. fun tool: http://www.hquotes.com/tradehard/simulator.html

Catching up from yesterday, as well as one early this morning. The U/C sell had a pretty small SL (2x ATR = 14p).

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Kind of a wacky trade, as it showed up as a big pattern on the 60m. If trades show up on the 30m or 60m, I want to see if they also show up on the 15m. If they do, I will take the trade there, as it will have a smaller ATR which should result in less time in the market before a SL or TP gets hit. Less time in the market equates to less time my money is at risk, and it also lowers the probability of having two trades running at once. Of course with a smaller SL, you run a higher risk in general of the SL being hit, but off the top of my head I want to say that most 15m trades backed by higher time frame trades are winners (generally a common theme among traders: find a signal on one time frame, and go one time frame lower to get a good entry point). That being said, I found that the pattern on the 60m did indeed show up on the 15m, but it was a very large pattern. No big deal! If you didn't catch this trade, there was a shorter pattern on the 15m right afterwards that also resulted in a win. TP would not have been hit in time to take that trade (unless you wanted to double up on a position, which I don't really want to). January 2010 is on quite the win streak. Here's a snippet of trades since the 13th: Break Even Win Win Win Win BE Loss Win Win Win Win Win Win If this is how January ends, average win=1, average loss=0.67. 16 wins, 9 losses. Expectancy is a whopping 0.4, and % return trading 3%/trade would be the second highest yet in my testing so far (July 08-Present). edit: since I would call it quits at 1pm EST and go to bed if I were trading live, and there were no more trades today, those are indeed the final January stats.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Sell and cover this morning for a 1/4 win.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Large overnight pattern for a loss on the U/C, and an E/U buy in progress, close to TP.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
The E/U buy yesterday was a win, and looking over the charts today, I found this E/U sell, which would still be in progress. edit: would have hit TP level

--- 帖子 #902 ---
E/U short - win U/C short - loss

--- 帖子 #903 ---
So I'm not 100% sure about fills during NFP today, but these popped up. A few still in progress. No more than two trades at a time would have been open. edit: open euro trade was a win, u/c trade was a loss.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
I finished back testing the last half of 2008 with these expectancy numbers (note this is NOT % return!): Inserted Code Month Expectancy Jun 08 -0.19 Jul 08 -0.04 Aug 08 -0.06 Sep 08 0.29 Oct 08 0.20 Nov 08 0.12 Dec 08 0.12 Trading June-August would have been rough on your account if you were trading 3%/trade. Cumulative 28% draw down! However, if you had kept on trading, you would have ended the 6 month period +33%. Not to mention the stellar performance since then. I hope to get the first half of 2008 tested ASAP.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
U/C 30m sell today would have been a win: edit: and one from yesterday I missed

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Two more wins. They were both close calls, peaks differing by one or two pips on each. I really don't want it to look like I'm posting winners only, but that's what it seems like recently =x

--- 帖子 #907 ---
U/C trade hit profit overnight, while I would not take the second trade posted here because it's so close to when I would quit on a Friday. I've recorded 12 wins and 3 losses so far this month (average win being 93% of the average loss).

--- 帖子 #908 ---
It seems silly to just keep posting charts like it's a trading journal or something. Maybe I will start one of those? U/C loss a bit ago.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Finished my testing of May '08 with 16 wins, 20 losses, average loss being 0.96 of the average win. This resulted in an expectancy of -0.09 So far for 2008: Losers: may, june, july, august Winners: september, october, november, december Untested: january, february, march, april 2009: No losing months. Really makes me I'll be double checking results soon.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
It's possible that the necessary correlation began in September, 2008 and still continues. It looks like that is the case. I don't know how to prove it. I don't know of any figures that will give past correlation data. If that is the case, it would be easy to avoid such times with a correlation indicator. There are several out there I have seen.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Because of the "shifting" problem with the overlay indicator, I had to go back and make sure E/U and U/C had all matching bars on 15/30/60m time frames throughout 2008 and 2009 for backtesting purposes. I can post the data if anyone is interested. Because of having that data in excel, you can do the CORREL() function on X bars of past data to find the correlation. Then to kick it up a notch, add in conditional formatting color gradient, and it starts to look really cool. I suppose this is what MT4 correlation indicators already do for you as new bars are added to the chart. I've attached an example for anyone unfamiliar with the concept. I used typical price HLC/3 15m data from May 08; times are MT4 broker times. The question I have: We can spot where divergences appear in real time...we don't need a lagging indicator to do it for us; therefore, we should apply this to a higher TF as a filter, right? But is that an arbitrary filter, or one that actually means something? The whole idea behind this method is that the two pairs we're trading are highly correlated on a grand scale most of the time. We are just diving into the smaller time frames with a sniper rifle to pick out the times when they sway from the norm, assuming they will always go back to the norm . You wouldn't trade G/U and U/J with this method because their correlation isn't anywhere near as consistent with other available pairs such as E/U and U/C. So why trade E/U and U/C when they're having an off day? But how do we clarify off day? Won't it be off X-days-period? I won't jump to conclusions until I can pull some data.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
I'll try to pull daily TF data for as long as I can reliably go back (I imagine until 2005 at least?) and throw it into excel with the correl() function. edit: probably give it 20 days worth of data for the correlation coefficient? That's a month. Maybe compare with 5 for a week?

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Hopefully this gives you an idea of the correlation during the period where your expectancy was down. It uses the same 50 period look back that Mataf uses. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Thanks for your post! Will be great to compare notes with.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
I graphed daily correlation for periods of 20 and 50 across 2008 and 2009, and I didn't see much you could take away from it. I will post the charts when I have time to clean them up. I think if you're going to use 20 or 50 data points, it is silly to use daily data. Going to look at 12 and 24 period hourly correlations next. If there are obvious trends there, maybe we can take something away from that.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
February ended with 27 paper trades for me: 17 wins 10 losses. Expectancy of 0.23 (avg win = 96% of average loss). I'm spending this week trading live in preparation of going live! So I may post some more charts. As far as those correlation numbers go, I don't like the idea of making a "should I trade this setup?" decision based on lagging indicators. I would rather base the decision on the pattern being traded and market hints. One thing I've found fairly consistently: if a trade goes immediately into loss and never sees much profit by the time it's 80-90% of the way to SL, it will rarely get back to TP. I think I've also spotted a few "types" of setups that have higher win rates than average, but that might just be confirmation bias rearing its ugly head. All results posted so far are still unfiltered except for time of day, no more than two trades at a time (don't run into this very often at all), and no open positions before interest rate announcements

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Has anyone ever noticed the overlay indicator repainting while on a live feed? I've been scared for this all along, and I think it might have happened this morning, but I'm not 100% sure...

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Yes, I've seen it repaint many times. Any time a bar of data is missing from the overlaid pair, the alignment shifts all the way back. This is what makes backtesting difficult. When a new bar begins, if one pair receives it's price tick and the other doesn't, the alignment shifts and then shifts back when the tick is finally received.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Sorry Bill, that's not what I meant. Have you ever had two peaks at say, 1.0770, then you double check them again later for whatever reason, and one is now at 1.0770 with the other at 1.0771? I hope that is more clear

--- 帖子 #920 ---
No, I've never had that happen.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Good to hear...I guess I just missed something then. Anyway, results from live trading this week were 3 wins, 2 losses. 1:1 R:R. Still lots more of March to go!

--- 帖子 #923 ---
A little off-topic, but... E/U and U/C have been very correlated recently, and (subsequently?) E/C action has ground to a halt. Is this the spring tightening before it expands? What do you think?

--- 帖子 #924 ---
March ended with 30 paper trades, 20 wins and 10 losses. Average win was 1.04 times the average loss. Expectancy result of 0.33. I've been toying around with using the original 2xATR for a TP but only 75% of it for a SL. I have two years of back test data now, and I have the 75% SL data for 19/24 months. Expectancy of doing that for this month would have been slightly lower, at 0.3 (18-12 with average win being 1.37x the average loss). However, on the whole so far, 75% SL seems to smooth the equity curve, making drawdowns not as bad, but also occasionally chopping some off the top of the breakout months. Of the 19 months that I have data for, 13 of them would have resulted in making more or losing less money. I've recorded one winning month going to a loss, switching to this method. Since I hear so much about capital preservation being a key to staying in this game, I will seriously consider going live with 1.5xATR stop losses and 2xATR take profits. The scary part (for me at least) comes when you're throwing down multiple lots with a 12p (or similarly small) stop loss, as trading fixed fractional with a non-trivial bankroll and this method would dictate. Can anyone speak to their experience with large, highly leveraged orders? Or am I just being a sissy? Average stop loss for this past month would have been 20 pips with the 75% method...

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Update! I'm now trading this system live, every day. I'm taking trades occurring between 1AM and 12PM (noon) Eastern time, and I'm using 75% of the 2x ATR for my SL, 100% of the 2x ATR for my TP. 2.25% of account lost on a loss, 3% of account won on a win. The repainting of the overlay that I was worried about is true. I just took a trade based off of a 1 pip difference in the overlay (left red peak was 1.0655, right red peak was 1.0656). It was stopped out, and that's fine, but the peaks now both read 1.0655. I am sure that it repainted, because I triple checked the values in the data window both before and after entering the trade. Only ~10 minutes after the bar had closed did it repaint. It concerns me, because I imagine during all of the manual backtesting the peak values never changed, and this is an example of where I would not have taken the trade, assuming that in a manual backtest scenario I would have seen both peaks at 1.0655. It may not matter in the long run, and I will keep track of which trades were affected by this phenomenon.

Is there any one who trade with this system, it is quite interesting, why everybody given up?

April results trading full 2x ATR on both TP and SL would have landed you a loss this month trading 3% FF MM. I tracked 10 wins and 11 losses with the average win being 0.93 of the average loss and expectancy of -0.08. Trading with SL = 1.5x ATR would have been expectancy of 0.05. I ruled out three trades across the 2nd and 5th due to bank holidays. Unfortunately with my live trading I popped in during the second half of the month (where I caught a string of 5 losses!) and was down 4.6% at the end of April. I'm currently short U/C on a less than stellar pattern setup, but I'm trying to trade as mechanically as possible for now so I still took it.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
May ended for me with 31 trades: 16 wins and 15 losses, with the average loss being 67% of the average win (I'm trading SL = 1.5xATR). Expectancy resulted in 0.17. It was a great month following April, and it really lifted my spirits. I'm looking forward to June!

updates? Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #933 ---

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Oops, forgot to post June results. For my personal trading, June ended down 4.9%. I got lucky though and missed a losing trade. I guess you could say I was also unlucky, in that I had two trades that missed TP levels by 1 and 2 pips. For system trades, I recorded 14 wins and 22 losses, with the average loss being 77% of the average win (remember, I'm trading with stop loss = 1.5x ATR). This results in expectancy of -0.09 if I did that math right. The last day of June trading had two losses itself, reminding me that "it ain't over till it's over"

Hello everyone, I am pretty new to FX trading and trying to learn and am making my way reading through this thread slowly trying to absorb it all. I would like to know as I am not overly skilled at MT4 (I can place trades and set SL and TP) how I can load and use this indicator of Luxinteriors so that I can use it to learn about and spot divergence. I hope that the thread is not too cold and people are still using this method as it seems to have good sound principles. I am still trading in demo and learning. Thanks to anyone who may reply.

October was awful! 10 wins, 22 losses. Average loss was 81% of the average win. E = -0.21. Personal account lost 17.3% November was great! 19 wins, 15 losses. Average loss was 0.74% of the average win. E = 0.22. Personal account was up 16.7%; however, I missed 7 trades (for various reasons) that I should have taken. I calculated a theoretical 24% return had you taken every trade, which would have made up for all of October's losses +3% or so.

December stats (I only traded until 12/17 then took vacation until the new year. I did not go back and check how the system performed otherwise ): 9 wins 11 losses. Average loss was 75% of average win. E = 0.038 January stats (includes 1 win on MLK Jr holiday): 16 wins 15 losses. Average loss was 75% of average win. E = 0.097

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Thanks Cosgrove, - for keeping this thread up-to-date on your results. This system does look very interesting. I like your SL to TP ratio, it helps to make up for losers. I'm wondering (rhetorically) if most systems, in the long run, only return 50% winners &amp; 50 % losers. Prospector48

--- 帖子 #948 ---
I have had this thought recently as well, except I expanded it to postulate that as your R:R skews towards 0 or infinity, your % win rate will go towards 0% or 100%. For example, 10% win rate with a Risk:Reward of 1:10, or 90% win rate with a risk:reward ratio of 10:1 (numbers pulled out of a hat, obviously) I'm not sure where the Random Walk/Efficient Market Hypothesis or real-life trading constraints (margin rules, etc) fit in there. There are also many people who will argue that for your system statistics to mean anything, you need thousands upon thousands of trades, which I can somewhat agree to. If you go by that idea, then there is a non-trivial chance that the fundamental nature of whatever market you are trading may change before you reach that many system trades, thereby possibly invalidating all testing done so far. The next step in my mind would be to think "OK, so we're basically picking a system that seems to make sense and hoping for the best?" -- does that mean we're just hoping to "get lucky"? Looking back just now, I have logged approximately 1000 trades with this system between April 2008 and today (only taken ones between April 2010 and today as live trades). Approximate win rate is 52.5%, and I use approximate here because I do not have TP=2xATR, SL=1.5xATR data for all of 2008-2009. If you put those stats into the equity curve generator here: http://www.hquotes.com/tradehard/simulator.html (Win/Loss = 1.33, prob win = 0.525) the system looks very promising.

February results! 15 wins, 14 losses, with average loss being 77% of the average win. Expectancy of 0.146.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Sorry, this expectancy should be 0.153 (E = (16/31)*1-(15/31)*0.75). It would be 0.125 without the MLK Jr day win. Didn't mean to mislead. March is going well so far!

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Theoretical March results: 14 wins 13 losses Average loser was 75% of the average winner Expectancy = 0.157 I missed a few trades this month and messed up another causing a loss instead of a win, so my personal results were not up to par with the system.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
April was quiet! I missed two wins, with one being on a bank holiday. I also had 7 losses in a row, which was pretty tough. Theoretical results: 8 wins, 8 losses, with average loss being 75% of the average win. E = 0.125

--- 帖子 #953 ---
May was pretty active, with 14 wins, 22 losses. One loss occurred on a bank holiday, I missed a loss due to personal vacation, and I slept through a few entries as well. My personal account fared slightly better than theoretical results because of all that. Average loser was 73% of the average winner. Expectancy = (% winners * average win) - (% losers * average loser) = 0.39*1-0.61*0.73 = -0.055

I was only trading EUR/USD vs. USD/CHF because they were the most correlated.

billbss hi, First of all, I must say that I really like your pragmatic approach in your inputs here on FF. Appreciate it! There are several leading "indicators" which based on my experience in terms of Forex really work. I only use them as triggers mainly, as signals that is time to enter into a transaction. One of these leading "indicators" is the Divergence on CII indicator (CII is one of the best Divergence indicators from my experience, possibly because is not normalized as other indicators ), other for example is the Slingshot from CCI (50,14 - you know better since I discovered it on your threads, thanks) , or the ADX contraction - expansion from forexalien (really good one, for entering and also for staying in the trade). Having the Pairs divergence is a very good additional tool for announcing possible entries, in my view. Pairs correlation was always a subject which I believed have something of value, but things seemed complicated until now and you made them really simple and clear in your thread. I have just ran into this thread of yours and I strongly believe you have something good here, thanks for this thread as well. Will read it thoroughly this week, with great interest. All the best to you, Dragos

Hi Rather than to start a new thread I have preferred to quote this one : firstly to thank billbss for sharing his idea secondly to let all followers till interested or trading too with this strategy That said : I racked my brains for finding a way to catch the whole in an EA and get FF opinions .I don't exclude to share the mq4 file (I am not a coder and friend helped me at least hope no bugs) just to improve it but for now I'll share the compiled version.In this way I would not be in contrast with FF rules. Set options in the exe file : CorrElements = integer number (the number of bars the calculus of correlation Max_bars_back = integer number(the number of bars for checking billbss condition) Trigger_Corr_Max = double number from -1 to 1 (Maxcorrelation that pairs are allowed to get when diverging ) every time I try to figure it out I have a hard headache Entry_Corr_MIN = double number from -1 to 1 (MinCorrelation that pairs have to be correlated enough for entering the trade. Eventually I'll attach a text file with the 3 functions in use .It may be someone is interested of putting an eye on them. Actually no indicators no SL no TP or other .... you can give it a try with all the options but the 4 options above are enough to begin to play Drag in H1 TimeFrame ......... Use in all TF .... of course not 1M too much noise ... if you use H4 or 30M should be better. I forgot .... trade in EURUSD .... correlated pair is GBPUSD . However you can change the pair as you need...... you can use every positively correlated pairs If back test : use the open price mode because this is the entry mode of Ea when new candle Regards g.

Hi, is there a way to automatically get an alert anytime a divergence occurs between those highly correlated pairs?

Hi cosgrove, can I ask you if you use an indicator to display the double line? If not an indicator can you explain how to do it? Thanks
