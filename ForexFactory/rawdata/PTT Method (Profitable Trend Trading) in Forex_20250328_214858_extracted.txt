Greetings, Introduction: I have been a lurker on Forex Factory for many years, but just have not posted much as I’ve not wanted to dump a trading system on the forum, that may or may not be profitable, without being able to include all aspects of trading: philosophy, methodology, money management. All the while I have been reading, testing various systems, and learning all that I could. In this thread I plan to share some things that I’ve learned over the years and then I will provide the system that I am just now starting to trade live. By the way, I only backtest and then trade live, I do not demo. There are two reasons for this; first, demo trading and live trading are different. There are emotions involved with real money that don’t exist on demo. Second, using Oanda I can trade “live” with literally 1 unit, which is one/one hundredth of a penny per pip. That means a loss of 1000 pips would be a loss of $1.00 (one dollar). One final bit of housekeeping here in the introduction: I have nothing to sell, nothing to promote and profit off of, absolutely no way to take your money in anything I post. While I do recommend some resources, these are simply books and threads that have helped me; I in no way profit off of any resource I recommend. The above stems from my detestation of some threads that started out as helpful threads but over the months and years had to be moved to the commercial section because, as it turns out, the originator of the thread had something to sell or promote and profit from. I have neither. Nor will I ever. I simply do not believe in paying, or charging, for any kind of trading education. Others disagree with me, and that’s fine, but I’m simply saying that, for me, I will never attempt to sell or promote anything that I could profit off of, in any way. So my posts will go as following: Second Post: Overall philosophy. This is the most important post. It is very important to understand the philosophy of trading before even examining the methodology (or system) of trading. The methodology of trading should flow out of your philosophy of trading. Third Post: Methodology. Just as the Apostle Paul set forth theology first and then the practical outworking, or the practical application of that theology, so my second post will provide a working methodology that meets the requirements of a good system, according to our philosophy set forth in the preceding post. Fourth Post: Resources. Here I will recommend the books that have changed my trading life, as well as various threads here on Forex Factory, and will even include one amazing You Tube video, from the greatest trend trader who has ever lived, that summarizes the philosophy and methodology of trading very well. So let’s move on to the second post.

Overall Philosophy: Are you a fundamental trader or a technical analysis trader (or both)? Are you a trend trader, a range trader (or both)? Are you a swing trader or scalper (or both)? Do you trade monthly, weekly, or daily charts (or all of the above)? Or do you prefer 4 hour, 1 hour, 15 minute or lower timeframes to trade? Do you like indicators or trading price action? Do you trade the news or stand aside? The above questions attempt to approach the subject of the philosophy of trading, and the answers to them are the single most important aspect of your trading that you must define, even before considering a system. I am a firm believer in trend trading. This stems from my worldview philosophy that trends come and go in this world, and to get on one is to profit greatly. Look into the world of fashion or cinema or theatre and the arts and you will see numerous trends come and go. Look into hair styling, clothing and jewelry and you’ll quickly see that trends come and trends go. The bell-bottom jeans of the late 70’s and 80’s were all the rage, and everybody wore them. Millions were made off of them. Similarly, look at any trend and notice that to follow the trend was to profit, and to go counter-trend was to lose. It is the same with trading. Anything. Look at the stock market, commodities, futures, and forex, and if you look at enough charts you’ll see that every market trends. This is why professional trend traders often do not know what market they are trading, they are merely following whatever trend happens to be in place at the time. It is extremely important that you be assured that your method of trading has a positive expectancy. This is especially true in trend trading, for in order to ride out the whip-saws we must be confident that the next trend is around the next bend, and when I get on the trend it will make up for all the losses and then some. Therefore, the method we trade must be a sound trading methodology which flows out of our philosophy of trading. While I am a strong proponent of discipline in trading, too much is often made about being disciplined in trading when the real culprit of our trading losses can be that we do not have a trading methodology that is profitable long-term. For a trend trading system to be profitable long term there must be some way to safely add on positions during the trend in order to compound profits. This is needed because whip-saw in trend trading is an inevitable, a given, and therefore in order for the trend to make up for the losses in whip-saw we have to be able to safely add on trades. Again, this requires a sound methodology when trend trading. For instance, sometimes we read statements such as this: “the real secret to trading profitably is YOU! You are your own worst enemy in trading, or you are your own best friend. Depending on whether you are disciplined or not, whether you can stick with your method or not, YOU are the real key to successful trading.” And while there are elements of truth in this, if we have a trading method that is not sound we can be as disciplined as we want, and ultimately we will not profit in trading. The method must be sound. Sound trading methodology plus disciplined traders equals profit in trading. It is my opinion that a sound methodology is a trend-trading method. Others may differ and prefer to try to pick tops and bottoms, using words such as “oversold” and “overbought” with indicators such as Stochastics, RSI and other oscillators. That is their right. That is their prerogative. Some are successful. I believe in trend trading. This means that when their indicators say “overbought” I buy, and when their indicators say “oversold” I sell. While they buy at support, I sell, and while they sell at resistance I buy. To each his own. This is what makes a “market”. One very important element in trading is to cut losses short and let profits run. The whip-saw effect of trend-trading will soon dissolve any account that does not do this. Next, I only trade the daily time-frame. This is certainly just a personal preference. I check the charts once per day at 7:30 PM Eastern Time to see if there are any orders that I need to enter, enter them around 8:00 PM, then I don’t check at all until the next day at 7:30 PM Eastern. Obviously the exception to this is on Friday, when I will check around 3:30 PM Eastern. I also place alerts on my MT-4 platform to notify me if a stop loss was hit so that I can re-enter the original trade (more about this in the “method” post). I do not give the news a second thought. Price action will tell me what the news is, and I can only make money on price action. Finally, I use no indicators except the EMA 50 for trend direction determination. That’s it. This is due to my philosophy that simpler is better. All I want to know is what direction is the trend, and then how do I hop on the train. Summary: Think of the trend as a giant locomotive. Once this train starts it may take some time to get “up to steam”, to get really moving along. But don’t try to stand in front of it and stop it. It will bowl you over and then run you over. It is the same with a trading trend. Much better to hop on the trend and ride it until it stops, or until you decide to get off. Much safer. In my “Resources” post I will recommend some books that have entirely changed the way I trade, made me a trend-trader for life, and will no doubt help you too if you’ve not already read them. Next post: the method.

Love your post and Good Luck. Looking for the "the method" post..

--- 帖子 #6 ---
km, i can't wait to read your complete trading method. thx

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I like what you are saying. And I am looking forward to your further explanation. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Nice thread, I think your methodology and overall philosophy of trading are both very, very similar to my own. My methods are explained in the thread "Long term breakout and trend following". I will be following this thread too, hopefully we can learn from each other

kelvin....just be carefull that this thread does not get kicked over to trading discussion ok?

The Method: Here is the method that fits the requirements outlined in the Overall Philosophy post above. As with all trading systems, there are some good things about this method, and there are some not so good things, or things that need improvement. What I needed to have in a trading method is the following: A way to define the direction of the trend A way to enter the trend A stop loss A way to add-on if the trend continues A way to exit the trend So here is a method that delivers on all of the above requirements. You may wish to change or tweak or add or remove portions to fit your own liking. A way to define the direction of the trend: I use the 50 EMA. If the price is above I only go long, if below I only take shorts. I tested a 200 SMA, and then a 100 SMA, but discovered both of those allow too much counter-trend movement such as when price gets a long way from the moving average and then returns. Both the 200 and the 100 have very strong counter-trend movements that the 50 would catch as a trend and allow the acquisition of pips. A way to enter the trend. I use Inside Bars. This includes Sunday bars, as I use IBFX for the signals (since the day candle closes at 8:00 PM Eastern) and place the actual trades on Oanda. Let’s take an example: Say that we are in a downtrend (price is under the 50 EMA) and price then makes an Inside Bar. At the close of the day (shortly before 8:00 PM Eastern) I will place a sell stop order at the low of the present bar/candle. A stop loss. I use a 30 pip stop loss. This is one of the most important aspects to trend trading. We simply must keep our whip-saw losses to a minimum and let our profits run. If using a 30-pip stop loss our risk/reward can often be 1 to 10 as it is common to pick up 300 or more pips during a trend. One important thing about the stop loss…if the stop loss is taken out we enter the original trade again (a sell stop or buy stop exactly as the original entry—at the same exact price). This is because if the market retraces back to our order entry price, after having taken out our original stop loss, the momentum will usually continue, and we absolutely do not want to miss this trade. The above rule, along with the inevitable number of losses that come from trend trading, will most likely put this thread in the recycle bin. As soon as people start posting 30 pip losses here and there, along with not wanting to reset the trade once hitting the stop loss, will most likely make this thread not very popular. Of course the profits from one trend pays for all the little losses, and then some. But because real trend trading has numerous losses it does not make for a popular thread, as most want a system where we are “right 80% of the time” (even if that means a losing system because the losses are bigger than the profits). Trend traders are only “right” approximately 20-30 % of the time. A way to Add On if the Trend Continues. We take every Inside Bar in every trend. Even the Sunday candles, which much of the time are indeed inside bars. We simply place a sell stop at the low (in a downtrend) and a buy stop at the high (in an uptrend) of every inside bar. Sometimes this provides literally thousands of positive pips in a trend. A way to Exit the Trade. I use the previous bars high (in a down trend) and the previous bars low (in an uptrend) to exit all the trades I have open in a particular run. Money management is a personal decision based on risk tolerance. Since this method can be used on any pair, it is possible to have numerous positions open. Because of this I only risk a half of one percent on any one trade. If I happen to have open 10 trades my total risk will be 5%. Of those ten positions 2-3 will enter nice long trends which will far more than make up for the stop losses on the other 7-8. By the way, from August to December of 2008 (not trading the holiday season) this method made 6845 pips, net (including spread of 2 pips per trade) on AUD/USD. Then from January to April it made 1097 pips, net. Stay tuned for Post Number 4

Here are some resources that I have read that have literally changed my whole way of trading (and looking at society as a whole). If you are new to trading, read these books before you do anything else, and it will save you many lost pips. 1. Trend Following: How Great Traders Make Millions in Up or Down Markets by Michael Covel. Michael interviews great traders such as Ed Seykota to learn how they trade. This is the book that convinced me to be a trend trader and is a must read book. However, it does not contain any method or system for trend trading (at least none that could really be used in the currency market). 2. Attacking Currency Trends: How to Anticipate and Trade Big Moves in the Forex Market by Greg Michalowski. Greg sets forth a complete trading method. This book goes hand in hand with Michael Covel's book above. 3. Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders by Jack Schwager. This book will provide all the motivation you need to stick with it, despite loss after loss, or margined account after margined account. Jack interviews top traders and without exception they have all lost their first accounts and have learned the truth that Thomas Edison made popular, "just try one more time." The following are some threads on Forex Factory that have influenced me greatly: 1. Building Your Equity Millipede. This is one of the best threads on Forex Factory and should be required reading by all. A risk to reward of 1 to 100,000? Now that is trend trading! However, this method, at least in my opinion, falls short of providing clear guidance on exits. 2. Inside Bar Trading Technique. This thread is in the commercial section, and I have no idea why, as Damon was not selling anything nor pointing readers to anything that cost money. This is an inspiring thread, yet it stopped dead in its tracks and nobody knows why. One of the last posts Damon points to another thread he started where he is trading an entirely different method. 3. Long-term Breakouts and Trend Following. "NumbNuts" has done an excellent job of taking the same philosophy I believe in and making it into a system. I see no downside to his method whatsoever, and may possibly become one of the best threads here. And finally, if you want to skip all the above resources and just watch one song on YouTube which summarizes the trading philosophy of Trend Trading, just go here: Inserted Video . Next posts will be screen shots of the method.

In this screenshot you'll see: 1. Red up arrow indicating the Inside Bar. Here we put a buy stop order at the high of the Inside Bar, with a 30 pip stop loss. 2. Red Thumbs Down. Two days later the stop loss is hit for a minus 30 pips. We re-enter the buy stop at the same price. The next day the second order triggered. 3. "Stop Loss Order". Here we are moving our stop loss order up to the low of each succeeding bar. 4. Green Thumbs Up. This is when we exit the trade for a plus 178 pips. So we had positive 178 minus 30 for a total of 148 minus 4 pips for spreads equals 144 pips on this trade. Notice we had no add on trades on this run.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I wanted to post a trade that had multiple add-on trades, because this is where the real money is made in trend trading. On this screenshot you'll find (starting from the center of the shot): 1. 3 Inside Bars. Each one of them we place a sell stop at the low of each bar. 2. An Add-On trade about a week later. 3. The exit, for a little over 6000 pips.

how refreshing to see a thread which has tight stop losses and lets the profit run also you add to vtrades as you get inprofit i can not understand why most fx traders reduce the position size once they get into profit ???? Can you please tell me which pairs you have tested this on please

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Stumpy1, I have only tested this on AUD/USD but am confident it would work on any market; not just currencies but futures, other commodities, stocks, oil, gold, etc. We're just following the trend, cutting losses short, letting profits run, adding on when able.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Kelvin, How do you deal with areas where price is straddling your 50EMA? Do you stop entering trades until price has moved away or just carry on regardless? Regards, Michael

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi, Kelvin, great material for people trying to learn the long term trend trading methods. Like you I have been influenced by Covel and PipEasy on the equity millipede thread (I have'nt begun to read numnuts yet but surely will). A probably dumb question if I may, you say you set your stop loss at the high/low of the prior bar (depending on long or short of course) and exit all the current trades in that trend at that point. Often (on manual backtesting) this is just a relatively minor retracement in that trend which then turns and continues so I presume you just wait for another inside bar to form and set your sell/buy stop in the direction directed by the 50 EMA to begin again with your one position adding as the opportunity occurs in this "new" for want of a better term trend trade ? It's the patience that people need to learn, what Graeme in equity millipede thread is always emphasizing I seem to be finding the long term clue. thanks for your reply.

did u take today's IB? on eurusd?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Kelvin, Why a fixed stop loss of 30 pips? why not at the low of the inside bar or low of the previous bar? or why not in a logical location?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hello Michael, You ask a really good question. Because we have so many pairs we can trade I don't usually trade when price is bouncing around the EMA. I prefer to see a slope on the EMA (up for longs, down for shorts) and then a bounce off the EMA. A good example is to look at EUR/CHF right now. Thanks for the question Michael, may you be blessed in your trading.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hello TheFutureAce, I did not take today's IB on EUR/USD. The reasoning comes from looking at EUR/USD for the past month or so, and what we see is a flat EMA with price doing lots of bouncing around the EMA. This is usually not the best trading environment. I like to look for a sloping EMA and a bounce off of it, if possible.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Good morning Vijidas, This is a good question. The answer has to do with backtesting. I know that many people say to put your stop loss at the previous high (for a short) or the previous low (for a long). However, doing so would cause a loss of many pips with this method of trading, in comparison to a fixed stop of 30 pips. For instance, on the attached screenshot, if using the accepted method of placing your stops at the previous high for shorts, notice that you would place your stop at the high of the bar with the vertical line drawn through it, which would be over 300 pips away. To trade a trend-trading system you must accept losses through whip-saw, but we must also limit those losses as much as we can. A 300 pip loss is far too much. So to answer your question, through backtesting I've found 30 pips to be an acceptable stop-loss. I hope this helps, and if you have any other thoughts or questions feel free to discuss them.

The bell-bottom jeans of the late 70’s and 80’s were all the rage, and everybody wore them. That got me......just kidding. All the best with your thread. We need more threads like yours, pipEASY and numbnuts - for all of us trend traders. I`m subscribed. _____________ michael

--- 帖子 #24 ---
KM, Thank you for sharing your system. If an Inside Bar forms and the subsequent high or low is not broken within the next 24 hours, do you discard the signal and wait for the next setup? Good trading, BC2

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Excellent start. Subscribed..

Hello adowland, Nice to hear from you. Glad you have benefited from Michael Covel's books too. I just read a book yesterday where the trader being interviewed said 'trend trading is basically dead' in this market. Every few years somebody else says that, but the fact is that this world is full of trends, markets trend, and people get involved in trends. Always have, and always will. Anyway, to answer your question, yes if we are stopped out and then get another Inside Bar we enter again and continue on the trade. Someone might think that now we might be too far from the moving average, but as trend traders we ride the trend until it ends, always entering our position with the current trend. Thank you for your question, and all the best to you.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Michael, Glad to meet another bell-bottom jeans wearing trend trader. Should we start a club, meet on Wednesdays, and require all attendees to wear bell-bottoms? Yes, I wish everybody would read pipEasy and numbnuts' threads, those are professional traders, and I don't mean in the sense of trading for a living but rather they are approaching their trading in a professional manner. Best to you Michael.

Welcome FX_California, glad to have you join, and please comment or question as able. Have a good afternoon!

Hello Bobcat2, thank you for your comment today. I leave my orders in for 1 week and then reassess the market conditions after that time. The reason I do that is because in any trend you have several days that the market is counter-trend trading, and then resumes the original trend direction. We do not want to miss the resuming of the trend, and an Inside Bar order can remain a good place to get back in the trend for a week or so of the market running counter-trend. I've attached an example of what I mean. The red arrow down is an Inside Bar (barely) where the low is just missed the next day as the market runs counter-trend for most of that day. The the following day the trend direction resumed and would have taken out our Sell Stop order on its way down for a nice profit. As was said above, this scenario is fairly common where we see the market running counter-trend for a few days, even up to a week, and then resuming its original direction. I hope this answers your question, and if you have any other thoughts or questions please discuss. I wish you a wonderful day today.

Hi Kelvin, Thanks for the thread. I am very interested in this method. Question, You stated that you enter your trades 8:00 PM eastern US time. I am located in eastern US terefore I consider the end of day to be end of NY session at 5:00 PM. My broker is FXDD whixh just happens to have a server time that closes the current daily candle at 5:00 and then begins the new daily candle. How does the different broker times effect the method?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi KelvinM Nice thread and method. Which pairs are You looking on now? Elovv

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Kelvin, greetings from Houston, TX. Your method has caught my attention, it really makes sense. I have one question, just want to verify something. In your Method post you state: Let’s take an example: Say that we are in a downtrend (price is under the 50 EMA) and price then makes an Inside Bar. At the close of the day (shortly before 8:00 PM Eastern) I will place a sell stop order at the low of the present bar/candle. The low of the present bar/candle refers to that inside bar/candle, or are you referring to the candle after the inside bar/candle? Hope this doesn't sound like a stupid question, just want to make sure. Thank you, Darryl

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I used to live in Houston, TX. As per my understanding, it would be the inside bar. You may want to put a limit order after the new daily candle opens in your trading platform. Kelvin may confirm...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
After I read first page one more time, it appears that the limit order would be on the current bar not from the inside bar...

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Limit buy order on EUR/CAD...

Hi FX_California, I see you are using Oanda charting. Oanda's daily candle begins at midnight EST. KelvinM makes his trades at 8PM EST. So...your daily candles will look much different than his because of the 4 hour time differential. Question: Is this trading strategy effective in both time frames? Hopefully, KM will address this for us. I am using the IBFX platform as the new daily candle coincides with KelvinM's time for trades. But, I simply make my trades with Oanda. Great trading! BC2

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Kelvin, Thank you for sharing this logical trend trading. I would like to discuss about stop Loss (SL). When you say you RISK 1/2%, it means whatever your pips of SL (30 pips or 60 pips) ---&gt; your risk is still 1/2%, not more. It just effect the LOT SIZE. Example: You risk 1/2% of your equity (i.e. your equity $100000) = 1/2% * $100000= $ 500. Assume you trade standard account (1 pips = $ 10). When your SL 30 pips, ---&gt; your lot size = ($500/$10 * 1 pip) / 30 pips = 1.67 lot. When your SL 100 pips, ---&gt; your lot size = ($500/$10 * i pip)/ 100 pips = o.5 lot. When we put our SL based on the logical point (it is more difficult to be reached). Yes, in this case our lot size is small, but more difficult to Loss than only just take 30 pips without basing upon reasonable logic in technical analysis. I am sorry. This is just my opinion. Please comment and advice. Thank you and regards, Anton

Hi If You use IBFX for charting, I guess the new daily candle starts at Asian session. Is´nt Oanda spread high at that time? Maybee its better to find a brooker there the new daily candle starts at London or New Yourk open times for better spread? Elovv

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi All, I think people put to much emphasis on time zone differences especially when you are looking at a DAILY time frame. Your chosen currency is already trending, that is why you want to enter. The (hopeful) target is perhaps 300, 600 or 1000 pips away. Pip values between different feeds would usually be very minimal in comparison. If I get an inside bar on my feed and you don't, then I'm sure there will be other times when it is vice-versa. Whether I win on my inside bar and you lose on yours is irrelevant. Next time, or the time after, it will be the opposite. Swings and roundabouts. Regards, Michael

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Elovv, The Asian market opens at 5PM EDT. This is when FXDD's new daily candle begins; IBFX's new daily candle begins at 8PM EDT...the opening of the Tokyo market 3 hours later. Oanda's spreads have moderated by then. Oanda's new daily candle begins at midnight EDT. Oanda now supports an MT4 platform version and may or may not be what you are looking for. Good trading!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Bobcat2: Since I live in west coast, it's 9PM for a new day for Oanda here. So, I can use Oanda for order as well as chart. In my opinion, price will be always (mostly) same for different platforms. However, signal may be little different for 4 hrs difference. Since those 4 hrs are pretty quiet time, it may not matter too much and some times, it will work in your favor or some times against. As per intial post, KelvinM does the same as you are doing.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Took this short, entry was late......the green line is my 55 ema. Sorry for the differences in the chart, in the future I`ll post with 50 ema and without indicators to not disturb the thread. However, I thought the opportunity itself might be worth sharing. Good trading to all. __________ michael

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Michael, Great question, and thank you for posting the chart. Typically I like to see a bounce off of the EMA before trading it. Typically this system works good with that bounce because the bounce has usually happened by the time an Inside Bar forms.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Greetings winalot, glad to see you participating. If you examine your charts I think you will see the exact same thing as we teach in this method. By the exact same thing I mean, you will see the direction of the trend and then you will notice an Inside Bar at some point. This point may not be at the same place as someone else's Inside Bar, as timezones and brokers show different things. But the main points are all still there. Just trade your broker on your timezone and the results will equal over time. Good trading to you, sir.

Hello Elovv, welcome to this method, and thank you for the good question. Currently I have orders in for several CHF pairs. GBP/CHF, USD/CHF, and EUR/CHF. Of course if you wanted to limit your risk to CHF you would only go with the strongest pair and leave the others out. Thank you again for your question and if you have any more, or any other thoughts feel free to share them. Have a good trading day today Elovv.

Hello Darryl, Glad to have a friend from Houston, Texas. I have family around that area, just a little bit north, so hope to make it through one of these days. I hope you get some rain, I've been hearing about the horrible droughts lately! Your question is a good one, thank you for taking the time to ask and clarify. The answer is that we place the Buy Stop or Sell Stop orders at the price of the low (for short) or high (for long) of the actual Inside Bar itself. Of course the order will not be triggered until sometime later, up to a week, but the order itself is placed at the price of the low or high of the Inside Bar itself. I am attaching a chart where I want to draw your attention to several things: 1. The red down arrow indicates the Inside Bar that we would trade. 2. The red horizontal line indicates the price of the low of that Inside Bar. This is the price where we would place a Sell Stop order. I hope this clears things up. If you have any more thoughts or questions feel free to share them.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello FX_California, The main thing we are concerned with is the price of the low or high of the Inside Bar, not as much the timing of when we place the order. For instance, we could look back up to a week on some currency pairs, spot an Inside Bar, and place a buy stop or sell stop order at the high or low (depending on which direction we are trading). What I do personally is at 7:30 PM start my look for a trend, and then see if an individual pair has made an Inside Bar that day. If it has, then I place my buy stop/sell stop orders at the low or the high of that Inside Bar. I hope that helps. If more clarification is needed please ask. I'm also going to post my 2-step methodology for entering trades as soon as I get a chance. Thank you for your help in answering the questions, and have a very good day today.

Hello Bobcat2, good day to you. I initially got interested in trading this method by observing price action on Oanda's charts, and began my backtesting with them as they are the broker I trade live with as well. All was well with the backtesting and many pips were gained. However, due to my East Coast schedule I wasn't able to trade the later daily closing that Oanda uses so I also backtested using IBFX and had very similar results. I do not know what those results are because it has been a long time ago that I did the testing, but I do remember noticing very similar results using both brokers (IBFX and Oanda). We are all looking at the same market, it is just that different brokers display daily closings at different times, which will give us a little different perspective on the method. Whereas IBFX may display an Inside Bar one day when Oanda does not, Oanda will display an Inside Bar one day when IBFX does not. Overall the results should be similar, though probably not identical.

Hello Anton, thank you for your contribution. Your analysis is right on, and you have described well the typical method of placing a stop loss. However if I may challenge you to consider something, it might affect the way you look at stop loss placement in the future, or at least when considering trading this method. If you were to place a stop loss at the typical "last high" (for a short), and if that point on your chart were, say, 300 pips away, your lot size would be much smaller than if you were to place a stop 30 pips away. That means that your profit, upon successful completion of a trend run, would be much less (10 times less in this case) because of the small lot size. Looking at it another way, with my 30-pip stop loss in I can actually be taken out of the market a total of 10 times to be "even" with a stop loss placed 300 pips away, and then when the market does trend my profits would be 10 times greater than if I placed my stop 300 pips away. Of course the market would not meander around my order to take me out 10 times, but I'm just using that number as an example of why I place the stop losses in close. One final way of understanding it is that I'm really just looking for one or two good runs, maybe three or four on a good day, that trend nicely and allow me to add-on during the run. Those nice runs make up for numerous 30-pip stop losses. Thank you again for the question Anton and for contributing your input to this thread.

Michael, this is really true, and gives the "big picture" view of the method. Thank you for your explanation here, and providing input.

Greetings all, I wanted to take just a second and share my 2-step method for entering trades every day, in hopes that this might bring clarity to the method and stimulate further discussion if you would like. In this post I am sharing a screenshot of how I examine the market initially. At around 7:30 PM I begin looking through the different pairs. Because this is trend trading I have no interest in the name of the pair (other than to notice if I happen to be doubling up on a particular currency by using too many pairs of that currency). The way I examine the pair is to zoom as far out (using the magnifying glass with the - in it) as the MT-4 platform will allow. Once I get zoomed way out I do see the overall direction of the market. Some people like to look at a higher timeframe or two and that is a good method as well. However, I find that if I just zoom way out I can see clearly, at a glance, the overall direction of the market. I only want to trade those markets that are trending, in a clear direction (of course noting the retracements that all trends have) and have been for most of the viewable chart that I am looking at. As an example, in the screenshot of GBP/CHF where we have zoomed way out, we can clearly see that this pair has been in a downtrend for a long time (as have all pairs that have CHF at the end). So this, then becomes a viable pair to consider entering a trade. I write this pair's name down on my list of pairs to trade. And I keep examining pairs like this until I get a master list of pairs that all qualify to trade that particular day. In contrast to GBP/CHF, notice EUR/USD. While there are indeed some tradable trends, overall the market has been ranging for the full time available with this chart. Even more apparent does this become when viewing the pair over just the past few weeks to a month. It is clear that this is a ranging market, both in the longer timeframe and especially in the shorter. We want to avoid this market for now until a trend establishes itself clearly. So attached you will find the bigger picture of how I view the markets and pick each currency pair to trade for the day. The first chart is GBP/CHF and the second is EUR/USD. Thank you for reading and post any comments that you would like.

Hi Kelvin, thank you for answering my question and clarifying with a chart which bar to use. I would just like to make sure of what an inside bar is: It's when the BODY of the candle is within the HIGH and LOW of the candle before it. Is that right? Is it that simple? I'm looking forward to trying this method out. Its another hot day here in Houston, 104 for the high. Its the driest summer in the 11 years that I've been here. I'm looking forward to September. Have a nice day, Darryl

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Once I have my "Master List" of acceptable currency pairs to trade, I then begin looking for pairs that have recently bounced off the EMA and have formed an Inside Bar. Again, GBP/CHF is an acceptable example for this, and I have posted a screenshot of where you could enter an order on this pair currently. I say it is an "acceptable example" because the EMA is a bit too flat to make it a great example. But at least we can see the overall picture we are looking for, while our preference is to desire a pair that has bounced off an EMA that is sloping in the direction of our trade. So the two-step method for finding a trade is to first consider pairs that are trending overall, then we look for pairs that have bounced off the EMA and are currently an Inside Bar. This produces both good entries and good trends.

Dear Kelvin, Please let me know when do you remove your orders if they are not trigered? BR Sasa

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Kelvin, thanks for Your answers. I have some more questions. Do You always reenter if Your stop gets hit ore just reenter the first order on a pair? And how many times do You reenter? Guess it can be expensive if price is shopping between enter and stop? Best wishes Elovv

Inside Bar - A bar with a High that is lower than the previous bar’s High and a Low that is higher than the previous bar’s Low...not just the body. It's whole bar (including low/high) that had to be within the boumds of the previous bar.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I just wanted to say thanks for the really well thought out thread! It really made me think! I don't have any questions because you've covered everything pretty well. I think that the system is a nice balance of mechanical trading with just enough discretion to hopefully keep you out of trouble. I will just comment that back testing is really time consuming due to the 30 Pip SL and reentrys so I will begin forward testing ASAP. Attached is the AUDNZD form Feb. of this year to the present time, I just picked the pair at random and your system performed pretty well for very little work and very little draw down...

Here is an Indi to spot the IBs. First Step to create a dashboard for a quick look for IBs on a given day. It includes a true/false to include or exclude Sundays Draw a Histogram of IBs or Line ( I prefer the Histo) and the 50 EMA colored to specify flat times. Choose the difference between the values of the two past days. Try 0.0005 for USDCHF daily chart as shown below. Hope it helps Cheers Pat

Eamonn pm'd me asking if I thought KelvinM's strategy could be automated. I have done so; anyone interested visit http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...59#post4899659 This thread is about trading this strategy manually, so please direct questions about the EA to my thread, to avoid cluttering up this one.

Candlestick trailing stop in ea is causing stops to get hit larger than 30 pips. Which most likely means initial stoploss is being set correctly at 30 pips, but then candlestick is overriding it sometimes widening it. Run a backtest and notice if you have stoplosses of more than 30 pips, which shows you the error pretty quickly. Kelvin, thanks for sharing this nice simple method.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Kelvin and thanks for the insights How you deal with the situation whereby you set a sell stop which gets activated, and then stopped out (either same day / later day). I understand that you then establish a new sell /stop at the same level after being stopped out. But what happens when a stop is activated during the day, and price then moves back and through the original entry price in the same day, and continues in the originally expected direction? Would you just have to miss that entry, or do you check to see what price is doing during the day so that you can re-enter a new sell /stop order at the same level? Appreciate your comments on this. Regards

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Greetings Kelvin, After lurking in FF for months, your thread with your ideas attract me! I do have some queries for you. No issue on the entries but on the exit. A way to Exit the Trade. I use the previous bars high (in a down trend) and the previous bars low (in an uptrend) to exit all the trades I have open in a particular run. Appreciate your help to explain more clearly? I cannot make out..... previous bars high in a down trend. Thanks Kelvin for your willingness to share.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks Kelvin for the great thread. I am subscribed. To answer the question snowhyte, I believe Kelvin's just saying that the exit is taking when your stop is hit. You've been moving that stop with the trend each day so that would give a good indication to exit the trade. I hope that's right Kelvin.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Great. I get your idea. Thank you [quote=KelvinM;4898092]Hello Anton, thank you for your contribution. Your analysis is right on, and you have described well the typical method of placing a stop loss.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I don't think that this has been asked yet. How do you deal with multiple IB's if the original order was not hit? For example: 1) On Monday you put in a sell stop on an IB. 2) price goes up on Tue and Wed with another IB Do you cancel Mondays order that was not hit or leave it in place? Thanks!

Question on the sunday IB's. How should the inside bars on Sunday on IBFX be handled. There only a couple of hours in duration so naturally they're going to be small. Do we treat them as their own bar or add them in with Friday's? Thanks

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Read post #10 again

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yes, I've read the post and I understand he says "including sunday bars" but I was looking for clarification that he "meant" include that as an ib even if it is only a two hour bar. It seems to me in that case that you would always have an ib on Sunday, especially with the low volatility.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi kevin, Amazing thread. I know you trade off daily charts, however i like to trade off 4 hour and 1 hour charts. what size stop loss would you recomend trading your strategy off these charts? Thank you, Bren

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Really Great thread KelvinM. I'm already familiar with many of the trend trading concepts you bring up. I read them in Ed Ponsi's book: Forex patterns and probabilities. He pretty much has the exact mindset as you on trend trading. His methodology however was just using a set of moving averages that had to line up in sequence and have 10 daily bars not cross over them, and and entry upon retrace, so I found I rarely if ever got an entry and gave up on the whole idea as I could not find a different methodology with the same mindset until now. For a while I've been looking for a trading method that I can just check at the start of the next daily candle and ride out a strong trend, as from many failed attempts at live intra day trading with various methods I've come to the conclusion I suck at day trading and am mentally more suited for getting in and holding and locking in profit when and if it comes...............also getting up at 5-7 AM and either not finding a trade or not doing well in a trade sucks really hard. And I've often thought how great it would be if I could get a good method working that I could just check the charts every new daily candle open. Anyway......................Here are a few questions that I hope you will answer for me: Questions for you and your thread: 1. Will you use an a week old IB as a stop trade, if price is still in it’s range and you haven’t previously, and everything still lines up with the rules? 2. How many times will you reenter after -30 (3 strikes and you’re out rule? Or just keep entering if price stays around there?) 3. After stop how soon do you place next stop trade……wait till next day? Or as soon as stopped out? 4. How many pips close to 50 ema to consider it a bounce ? do you just eye it? 5. Do you trade this with all pairs or just a few of them? 6. Are there some pairs you purposely avoid and if so why? 7. 30 pip stop for all pairs? Or is it a function of ATR??? I can see AU working pretty good with a 30 pip stop after an IB, but some pairs like GJ would probably stop out 30 almost every time? 8. 30 Pip stop + spread???? 9. That 6000 pip gain, did you actually achieve that live? Or was that just a back test scenario? 10. How long have you been trading this live and how have you been doing with the current rule set?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
happy to read your thread..make sense for everybody..keep it up..

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hello all, This thread really made sense to me. After 3+ years of wandering around the FX world and trying different EA's and manual strategies, I'm hoping this is the one that'll stick. Most things I've read and learned about trading seemed to always point to trend trading as the real deal, but high profit scalpers or easy money made through EA's and such are just too tempting to ignore and have kept me distracted from a good, slower, trend method till now. Anyway, here is my first trade. It looks to meet all conditions, obvious downtrend (well below 50ema), recent IB, and it even bounced off of 50ema (8/4). I just put my sell-stop at the low of the IB with a SL of 30. So far price made one fakeout and moved down and back through my SL, so I just put a new, exactly same sell-stop with the same values. Hope I'm doing this right. Good luck to all that are attempting this PTT method, too. alto

--- 帖子 #76 ---
nice one alto, we'll see how it works out. the ea has this pending trade, however other than that it's worthless. It's already been taking longs on GJ this week, so even the basic 'trade with the trend' rule isn't being followed. Would love if a quality coder could tackle this simple method.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Just wanting to guage opinion. I have attached a screenshot for gbpchf. An inside bar has formed. The general trend for quite some time has been downwards and although price has currently broken through the ema this did happen once before around begining April and yet the trend resumed. Using this method would this IB be one that I should be trading or because the ema has been crossed should I wait for a recross and another ib. Paul

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I'm also watching this trade and have my pending stop loss set on today's low. I just can't bring myself to count that 2 hour mini IB from Sunday evening.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
eurchf would also apply in your question as well, same situation

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yesterday there was IB on usd/chf I sold at 0.8115 TP at 0. 8070 made my easy 45 pips this morning! Vola!! LOl This system is good . I had it on usd/cad too. I have sold it at 0.9756 still waiting for it!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
why did you sell usd/chf it is above 50 ema, isn´t it? so according to the definition a buy stop would be appropriate

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I had put Buy as well as sell orders. Sell order hit first.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Kelvin thanks for the simple system. It's well thought out and well presented. I had a couple of questions. I did read the thread twice and apologize if you've covered these somewhere. 1. Do you take support/resistance lines into consideration when placing your pending orders? If you saw that placing a pending order would put you right up at a support or resistance level would you still place the trade? 2. On a daily basis do you move your SL for in profit trades? If you do is it always 30 pips from the current price? 3. Someone else had mentioned this but I'll ask it too. A 30 pip SL might work well for AU but I think with GJ you'd get stopped out a lot. I knowyou want to cut losses quickly but have you traded other pairs with this system and changed that 30 pips to a different value? Last night I checked a bunch of daily charts and found a number of IBs. I set my pending trades and the USD/JPY short triggered. Only after the fact did I realize the price was at a pivot/reversal point. (I use Murrey Math lines instead of fibs). Long story short Ilet the trade run and that trade is now 12 pips into profit on demo Thanks again kelvin, Sandy

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Sandy and all, Sorry I'm too lazy to go find the quote, but I remember reading that when Kelvin was explaining his 2-step setup that he set a 70 pip SL for the jpy pairs (I'm guessing that 30 is cool on u/j, though) and 30 pip SL for all other pairs. (don't think he trades gold or silver, but I'm not sure.. Kelvin?) about the u/chf trade yesterday.. yes, there was an IB, but price is clearly above 50ema so if we are trading PTT, it should be buys only, I think. That sell paid off, but it was a countertrend trade, not PTT. Kelvin, is this right? Kelvin also said, and I agree, that he looks for a bounce of the 50ema before he checks for IB's to enter. This confirms that the pair has made a retracement within a strong trend. I am trading this way and think that PTT could surely work with the more aggressive way and just trading all IBs, bounce or no, but u'd get many more SL's hit. alto ps. I re-read my post and was thinking that I would probably enter on an IB, bounce or no, if/when price was far away from 50ema and chuggin along.. in a strong trend with no end in sight.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks. What post number or other thread did he mention 70 for the jpy pairs? I read the thread 3 times through and couldn't find it. Would just like to read it for myself. (although that sounds about right for the jpy pairs, they run for way more pips anyway when the do run.) P.S. I'm up about 550 pips on 7 pairs since tuesday (live, small lots). Made a few day late entries with the stop 30 from the IB. Got some profit locked in and some at break even and some at very small sl right now. EURNZD I'm up 325 and will be locking in 200 pips, which even if everything gets stopped out now, I'll end up with at least a small profit. I think I may have found the perfect way to trade for me, most stress free trading I've ever done and easy if then else choices.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I am long on aud/cad at 1.0469 TP 1.0531 IB today. Sl at 1.0434.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
You entered somewhat early. If you actually entered and didn't just put in a stop order Entry is supposed to be with stop order at the high/low of the IB. So, once it passes. The whole point of an IB being that it shows a tight range, and the stop order is put to hopefully catch a breakout of that and a continuation of the trend. So, by entering early, what you kind of did is entered long at the top of a range, if it keeps ranging down your going into uneeded drawdown. Maybe getting stopped out and then it continuing anyway. Also it hasn't closed yet, although there's only a few more hours left and not likely to not be an IB. P.S. I'm in that one too, but long from the last IB. Hope it works out for us both.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Our day begins at 5 pm EST. So what you see is a daily chart showing position at 5 15 pm today. IB high was 1.0474 when I longed at 1.0469 fxdd has 10 pips difference . I dont want to lose more than 30 pips as He said here. Lets see what happens.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Ya I was thinking that might be the case. After looking at my charts a second time I realized I didn't even have your last candle on my chart.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi all, I went back and read all of Kelvin's posts again and I did not see any posts that said he uses a 70 SL on the jpy pairs. I wonder where I got that from.. maybe someone else said it? Anyway, KumoDragon, what pairs have u traded so far? or are currently trading with PTT? My SL on u/j just got hit for the second time and I put in another short stop order at the same price. Maybe it'll drop for good this time.. alto

--- 帖子 #91 ---
EN, GU, UJ, AU, NU, AC, AN, GJ. 3 still running (512 pips floating profit), 1be, 1small loss, 1 small gain. I'm looking to try this out on all of them, that have a trend or reversal I like. ( I know kelvin doesn't do the reversal thing, but I figure if it's gone through the 50 and looks like a reversal its worth a shot for 30 pips risk, to maybe nail a larger run) I got stopped out even on UJ. I'm passing on it for now myself as it looks like it could be hitting a flat bottom. Looking left it had a problem getting past this point before. I'll wait for another IB that bounced off the 50 on this one before I try it again.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks for the info guys. Alto gbp/chf looks good too. I entered the short a day late when I saw the IB. Not sure why I missed it. But it made 100 pips during the night. I had a TP set my mistake. Sothis morning I re entered the short and it's up another 100 pips. Some of the other IB systems suggest placing a pending order at both sidesof the IB, I know that's against Kelvin's rule of trading with the trend. But it's something to look at. I found the attached indicator. It highlights any inside bars. When you set the color make sure to make it lighter than your bar colors. Aso make it a 4 or5 in thickness. The open bar will usually be lit up as an IB until it closes. I think this is more helpful if you're looking at how this strategy would have done in the past. It also does a display alert for IBs on the current bar when it closes. Take care! Sandy PS This is all on demo...darn it

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I agree KumoDragon... I'm floating 763 pips in Echf, Uchf and Au. Today will make 8 days (rule says up to a week) since a Echf IB formed that could break today for my 2nd entry...play to move my SL on first entry behind today's closed candle locking in 130 pips. Will follow Kevin's rules...THANK YOU SO MUCH KEVIN FOR HELPING ME SO MUCH! Had several trades hit SL but "What Me Worry" when up so many pips. Steve

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Steve, Just to confirm my understanding...all 3 of your trades were countertrend and that you put a buystop and a sellstop on the IBs in this case. Looking at the charts that is how it appears to me. Am I misunderstanding something. thanks.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I look from left of chart to the right so called them all trend trades. Its not unusual for a day candle to cross over the 50ema and soon form an IB signal to cross back...especially if a nice trend has been in progress for a long time and price needed to cross the 50 to hit the next area of resistance or support to the left first. Just IMHO... Hope the charts help..."Free advice is worth every penny of it" so wait on Kevin to give a better answer than mine. Kevin's method is working. Best of luck. We all need it! Steve

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Steve, Thanks for your insight. I concur with your concept of trend vs actually using the 50 as hard and fast. Did you just use a sellstop based on the trend being down? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Here is "yet another" IB indicator. I just created this one so I could see the candles highlighted including the Highs and Lows.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
yes I did; if I get stopped out at -30 I set the sell or buy stop again according to my understanding of the rules. Steve

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Flyer thanks for your nice indicator. Following strictly KelvinM rules, today I did not find any IB in my 20 pairs. My broker is Forex.com UK that change daily bars at 1 AM London time (9 PM my local time)

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Since it was mentioned earlier in the thread about Michael Covel's book "Trend Following" I have just picked up his latest book (copyrighted this year) called "Trend Commandments" and it too is a ripper which really hits you where you are and shakes you out of it helping to dispel a lot of myths created around this game called trading Alex

--- 帖子 #101 ---
My SL hit! -30 pips. Thats ok, all in the game. Better Luck next time!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I like Flyer's indi too. It's very helpful to see the wicks. I did have a usdcad long trade trigger. It's up 45 pips. Didn't see anything else. usdchf trade closed in profit last night. I ignored the rules and set a 200 pip TP and it hit during the night.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I wanted to throw something out to get some feedback. I know Kelvin's method is to trade with the trend. But I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to place pending trades on either side of the IB? This would capture pull backs and true reversals. I've attached a eurchf chart as an example. If the trend is long and price initially breaks long then you're fine. If the trend is long and price breaks long but reverses then you're out 30 pips but have a short trade If the price is whipsawing the most you'd lose is 60pips (failed long &amp; failed short) Any thoughts on this? Am I missing something? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I think trading IB's both ways could work but I think Roman would say why do it when you're rolling in the pips already with the trend...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Yeah probably. I don't want to muddy the waters. I'll stick with the rules for now. The losses are minimized and the results when you catch a trend are amazing. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Very interested method. Congratulations !

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Very good thread KelvinM, did you say you begin the trade when the daily position finishes below/above the 50 ema then when inside bar occurs you trade. Can the the bar still be touching the 50 ema or does it have to be totally not touching. This is something i believe i traded like several years ago before my accident . keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #108 ---

Hi all, I feel a bit left out since I choose to only trade just the 6 major pairs plus e/j and g/j. Missing some of the action, but I think that might be good too.. teach me some patience. nubchai, i think there might be some extra pips to be had if we do trade the high and low of each IB (bracket every IB with stop orders).. I did a quick visual backtest of e/u and it looks like at least 20-30 pips are always there, sometimes 100+. While this appears good, a solid TP would be hard to calculate. Also, with the added potential losses of 30 pip here and there, it would need to be more like 50 TP in order to profit overall. Anyway, the real issue for me is that it would be countertrend trading and not PTT. Maybe try a method like that as an additional option to PTT and see if it's profitable in the long run. I wanted to answer behman.. a/n - nice looking trend there, I would say short since price is below 50ema g/u - price is ranging, no trend (Kelvin said look for strong trend and a price bounce off of 50ema) i would wait some.. let trend develop first. W are trying to follow trend, not trying to catch one before it even starts. g/j - how did u get your target/TP? I thought there was no TP in this method? Did I miss something? e/a - I am using mbt and can't zoom out your chart to tell, but it should look approx. the same as mine.. i think price is ranging so I would say wait for a strong trend. But if u see a trend already on your chart, then it's an easy answer.. price is below ema so short only. e/cad - I see a giant whipsaw around ema, price is now right at ema, no strong trend.. wait. ok, that's for now. good luck to all, alto

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hopefully Kelvin will come back to answer some of those questions. I too am wondering about : 1- if your new order hits the SL and price then retraces beyond your initial entry, do you place a limit order or just wait for the next setup? 2- With ADRs of 52 - 314, is a 30 pip SL really good for all pairs? 3- Do you add the spread? 4- Do you consider the swaps of currencies when deciding which pairs to trade?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi guys, I was just putting in some stop orders and I had a couple old ones I forgot about, and they were going the opposite way to my new orders. Anyway, if your broker is a U.S. broker like mine, then it would be impossible to have a buy stop and a sell stop at the high and low of an IB as the mt4 will just give a 'no hedging allowed' error. Some people were thinking of an add-on countertrend deal, by maybe placing stop order at high+low of each IB. I guess the only guys who care about this would be those of us lucky enough to live in the USA and have the good folks of CFTC/NFA watching over us..

Hello Alto, Thanks for your reply. I already had two positions closed on gbp/jpy shorted at 124.16 TP 123.70 . It went till 123.49!! I have again shorted this two positions at 123.95 TP 123.70. I had read somewhere about this IB method where it calculates ADR the difference between high and low to make those TP pips. E. G. 124.68 high and 124.16 low so, 52 pips.to be calculated when you trade as your TP. I hope this explains my strategy. I ahve not taken any other positions as I have very limited a/c money. LOL

--- 帖子 #117 ---
IMO, you stay out of it and look for another pair with a more convincing trend/direction. Sure it could work out, but it's obviously in a range, since were looking for some sort of trend to ride just moveon.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Alto. I tested this by putting a Buy Stop and Sell Stop order in for the same pair at FXDD -US (live acct). It took the orders and I didn't get the hedging error. I think it's because pending orders aren't in the market yet? Sandy

I had a ucad long that I had placed on 9-2. It stopped out this morning for 150 pips. This is where I'm not sure what the rule is. So after looking at the chart I re entered another long trade. As for my stops I wasn't following the bottom of the last candle rule. I'll have to go back and look at that. I think my eye balling and adjusting the stop resulted in too tight of a stop for a daily trade. It's hard to not lock in profits though Last night I took the GJ short trade with a 30 pip SL. It got stopped out. I place a new short order and it moved into profit. I think 30 pips is much too small for GJ.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
My suggestion put SL at opposite level. In GBP/JPY case it was at 124.68 which was last friday's high when shorting at 124.16 which was low.

Hi guys n gals hope your tradings ok, its a good thread kevinM with a very simple system. i do hope people dont start adding oher things as what to do to better it, i think if you intefere with your system they'll lose. i actually use a very successful simple system too but i'm sure but cannot be certain that i used something like KelvinM 's system a few years ago and equally proved successful. All i'm saying is dont change his system or keep it to your selves keep it simple, happy trading, happy days

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Guys, I think a lot are missing Kelvin's point on TP. Here's a quote from page one: " A way to Exit the Trade. I use the previous bars high (in a down trend) and the previous bars low (in an uptrend) to exit all the trades I have open in a particular run. Money management is a personal decision based on risk tolerance. Since this method can be used on any pair, it is possible to have numerous positions open. Because of this I only risk a half of one percent on any one trade. If I happen to have open 10 trades my total risk will be 5%. Of those ten positions 2-3 will enter nice long trends which will far more than make up for the stop losses on the other 7-8. " You don't set a TP going in. If you get away from your initial 30 pip s/l you just keep moving your s/l to the previous bars high/low (depending on direction) and eventually the trend will reverse and take out all your entries. That will be your "TP" level.

[quote=behman8850;4927880]Hello Alto, Thanks for your reply. I already had two positions closed on gbp/jpy shorted at 124.16 TP 123.70 . It went till 123.49!! that is a cool little strategy, i think i understand. For me, i want to try the PTT method as is.. just as Kelvin said it. I wish u continued pips, alto ps. I totally agree with what spyderman just said.. according to the PTT method, no TP is set initially. It's only after the trend takes price far enough in the right direction, then u simply move your stop to lock-in pips and let a turn in price/trend take u out.. NO REAL TP at all.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Did you not read the first page? Kelvin stated, "You may wish to change or tweak or add or remove portions to fit your own liking." And since Kelvin seems to have disappeared, I guess that's what we'll have to do. There are legitimate questions that have been asked to clarify how to handle certain situations that are not explained in the "rules" posts. I find very often that someone lists their rules for trading but leave out a lot of little details that they have learned by trading a system for a while, but don't think about them when following their main rules. And if you're not using it what do you care? I ran a live backtest on the AUDUSD starting in Aug 2008 and ending Aug 2009 to cover the example where he says he made 6000 pips (which I'm sure are micro pips because it's a 5 digit broker, so really 600) and quite a few re-entry trades were missed by not using a Limit order, just before the trend took off again. In fact, 2 of the trades he points out, were actually stopped out, unless using a Limit order to get back in. Still, ended with a profit of 2.7% risking 1% per trade. Profit is nice but that's a lot of work for less than 3%. Maybe adding the limit order will improve that. Edit: Oops, I thought I was risking 1% but in reality it was 0.1%!! That's a heck of a lot better! I'll post more results later.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
yes you are right Ericjschroed i have slight recall problems but my point is its a good thread and i dont want other people intefering with add ons.i've just made a large amount on the chf being smashed to pieces using my own trade method plus an adaptation of kelvins system but i wouldnt dare say on his site what you should do, thanks for your info happy trading. hppy days

--- 帖子 #126 ---
He also said he's just now starting to trade this system live so that's why he didn't have a lot of live trading stats. Also as he trades live he may come up with his own tweaks.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I just finished running same backtest as before but using limit orders to reenter if the first order was stopped out at initial SL, but the current price was above the initial entry. It only seemed that 1 time the limit order was not stopped out but it was good. Risking 1% again per trade resulted in a 40% return over 1 year. On 1 pair. So now I have to try some other pairs and maybe more current. I also did NOT use any short Sundays as entry, since I consider it a fake IB. Also did include the spread for SL and order entry. Anyone else doing any testing?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Don't see any new IBs so I'm on the sidelines

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Not to stir up anything but just for clarity, it was actually 6000 pips, though be it rare, this was during the financial crisis of 2008. Several currencies showed that type of magnitude. I can remember the GPB/JPY during that time was almost untradable intraday due to the violent swings in price.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Eric, I started live on Sunday with 3 entries, all of them stopped out. I think your are right regarding Sunday candles, I will omit them from now onwards. Pairs were CADCHF, AUDNZD (attached) and EURNZD. Anyway, very happy with my 30-pips SL.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi all, Well, I was getting a bit anxious after experiencing 6 SL's in a row, but it looks like I finally caught some good trades. I saw that these two pairs were on the move and it didn't look like they would slow down for an IB to form anytime soon.. so, I got impatient and put in some stop orders well in front of price (about 50 pips in front). The results are that I am in some profit now.. finally. As a side note, there must've been some news yesterday that caused a big price spike in ej that ate up what looked like a strong trend move and hit my SL. Guess that's typical market action..

--- 帖子 #132 ---
If you can't stand 70% losers, then this is not the system for you. And jumping in a trade because you're impatient will win a few and lose a lot.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Eric did your backtesting show a 70% loss rate with this system??

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Guys Today we will have a beautiful IB on eur/usd. Go long at 1.4148 TP atleast 50 pips. and Short at 1.3986. Good Luck. Tell me your results tomorrow.

Slight divergence as well---might be worth a shot

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi all, yeah, I've never done much manual trading.. been an EA guy for the last few years.. anyway, I was just trying to express the slight concern I got when seeing so many losses.. right away.. in a row.. and I was mistaken, it's 8 losses, not 6. (what's that about 80% losses?) No, I am in it for a good trial of this system, and I do have faith that it will all pay off.. eventually. I've been trading fx long enough to know that a couple weeks worth of losses (acceptable losses, not like account bust) is to be expected and it's the overall results that count. (IMO, a 3 month period is a good mark of a system's potential) About the jumping in a trade thing.. I strongly think that setting a pending order 50+ pips in the trend direction (trend found through visual analysis) just outside previous S&amp;R is far from simply 'jumping in a trade'.. also, I don't consider myself or anyone who makes a trade (even if it's just setting PO's) at a rate of 1 or less per day (as my record so far is 10 trades in 10 days), an impatient trader. I think that its just the way I write sometimes, I try to be light and with some humor at times, that made it sound as if I was some newbie jumping into a trade just bcuz I got impatient. We'll see, if those 2 trades pan out or not. (still in both now) alto

It's rare to see methods posted on FF where expectancy is ever mentioned. Thank you for putting this point across so well. I also use Oanda and will be forward testing with 1 unit per trade for a few months across the following pairs/crosses. Thank you for sharing your ideas.

Any successful trades last night? I was away from my computer and skipped a day.

Hi KelvinM and all, nice thread, long term trend trading is the only way I have found to make money in the forex Market and keep my sanity . Any way I am trying this out with small units on Oanda also to see what happens. Have 2 parked now EURCHF and GBPCHF, and we wait to see if we get a bite.

This Long that I took on eur/usd was stopped out at 1.4070 So I took the Correct IB Short at 1. 3986 TP 1. 3950 a while back.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
My theory of daily IB is to look for both directions short at the lowest and long at the Highest of IB Bar. TP always the distance between the two. We will always be Successful If we Stick to this Priciple in Daily IB. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Do you use the 30 pip stoploss?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
My stop loss always is high and low of the IB Bar.That s the sure way to succeed and not unnecessarily giving up early.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Guys watch out theses two pairs today around 5 pm est. Usd/Cad and Aud/Usd for daily IB Bars today. I will do follow up which I am taking and why.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I'll be sticking with Kelvin's rules for my own forward test. I doubt a 1:1 risk/reward, taking any IB has a +ve expectancy, but would like to see your stats proving that this assumption is incorrect....good luck.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Just to share with you from the book “Day trading &amp; swing trading the currency market” by Kathy Lien. For Long 1) Enter 10 pips above IB high – 1 lot 2) Place stop and reverse for 2 lots, 10 pips below low IB 3) TP = 2X SL or trail stop at that level

--- 帖子 #149 ---
So far I show audusd: 16% profit, 59% losers. eurusd: 10% profit, 61% losers. audjpy: 7% loss, 84% losers. gbpusd: 23% loss, 91% losers. In last year. All using 30 pip SL.

Hi all, well, looks like I've finally caught some winners.. btw, my record so far is 1/11 (not so good, huh?), but if these 2 trades continue good, I'll make it all up and then some. alto ps. my gu trade from before.. funny thing, I moved my SL to previous bar's high and then price seemed to immediately move to hit it and then move back in right direction. That's the market for u. Oh well, made 38 pips on that one and will just keep watch for a new IB on gu.

yes you are welcome to follow. Only patience required! LOl

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi, From what I understand Kelvin very strongly emphasises letting the profits run with the trend and not having a TP--to make up for the many small -30 pips stopouts. Aren't you short changing yourself by having a TP

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Agreed, Behman8850 don't take this the wrong way but you'd be better off providing your signals of your method in your own thread.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
My TP based on the distance between IB's high and low. A penny is Better Than a dime in bush! Dont you agree? Sometimes its 50 pips , sometimes more. e. g. In today's Aud/Usd trade I got my TP n then it went so low But iits because of this dollar strenghth due to last nite's Obama's speech.it went as far as 34! now at 61!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I dont think Kelvin has Ego problem like you have. have I done something wrong here? If it benefits all members here by making some pips also expanding their knowledge horizon, one should be open minded and welcome. I dont say his or any one's strategy is wrong. All I say is this is my way of IB Trades as I have learnt from someone else! No need to open any more threads. If you dont want to earn thats your choice buddy. But Dont give me Unwarranted advise. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
The thing that confused me is you're trading the 5 Minute chart when this strategy was started for the Daily chart. So when you say there's a trade on the AU and there's no IB on the Daily chart it just leads to confusion. I compliment you on your success but your strategy is not the Op's at all

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Please Look at my 150 and 151 posts . Always take Daily IB. I showed you when I successfully Closded my Aus/USD today morning! Be it 5 mt or daily chart. Point is TP taken at 1.0487 by me today although it went as low as 1.0434!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I've noticed that some of you behave like Kelvin is some kind of oracle or prophet - "Kelvin said this. Kelvin told us that. And if you have something else to say, do it in your own thread." Please, don't be silly. I think if someone was inspired by Kelvin's strategy and made some modifications then why not to share? Especially if Kelvin is not writing here anymore. Using low TF is IMO very risky for this strategy because price is very volatile there. But if it works for you, then good to know. Please keep writing.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Kelvin addressed some key issues when opening this thread. I asked you yesterday to show evidence of the positive expectancy your method has, otherwise your method will not benefit anyone long term.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Guys Please go through all my posts here. I daily place Daily IB on pairs. I long when 1 pip more than yesterday's high and shrt at 1 pip minus yesterday's low. my TP is always opposite high or low as well as SL also. Pl. ask me when I put my chart of the day with the trade if you have any doubts. I dont claim here for anything. I want everyone here on FF to benefit n make some nice easy streefree pips because I was stressd out with BS going on here with Eur/Usd trades. and always lost all the time. Since I began to Concentrate on Daily IB I am successful as yopu can see my daily results here. No offence to any body. I am a God Fearing man. Good Luck n God Bless You All Here!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Sorry My TP is always the distance between yesterday's high n low.ATR.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
...things have kicked off across some of the pending orders as well as the 2 EUR trades from yesterday, so hopefully by the end of the day the stoplosses can be moved to lock in some profit but still at a reasonable distance from the action, to allow the trades to breathe next week.

Hi all, Here are my open trades for now. You can also see that I have lost some money (started with $400) and if I were to close all floating profit, I would be making some profit. In fact, it would be a nice 8.5% ROI for 2 weeks of PTT, and an acceptable DD of 10% I moved my stops to lock in some of the float, but we'll see if the trends hold up or not. I am betting that there will be 1 or 2 pairs that make one really good trend that we can add on to (via IB's) that will make us pips vastly more than our losses.. at least I hope so. behman, I just wanted to tell u that I do like that u post on here and please keep it up, but can u add a running pip count or some kind of % ROI on your results. That would make it easier to compare results (I mean your method compared to mine) U also say that u have had success with your method already.. how long have u been trading it? what's your record so far? (in terms of trades won/trades taken, and also ROI in %) thanks, alto

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks Behman, I like your approach.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi behman and all, I just read through the IB strategy that behman posted. It seems like a good, simple strategy and the idea behind it is cool, too. (IB=shaken up bottle of soda =) I don't get the part about 25% lines or why they're needed. I also don't like the idea of using 3 different TP's.. but that's just me and I can see where it might be profitable to do so. All in all, it seems that this method relies on a high win rate to make it profitable. (1:1 RR) This is real different from the PTT method since it wins only 20% or so and so depends on a high expectancy in order to profit. The fact that both methods use IB's to enter trades is what ties them together. Thanks behman far posting this cool method and I look forward to seeing your results. Are u seeing the 80+% win rate like the PDF says this method should get?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
you are welcome. happy pips.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Alto and all friends here. As I said earlier I am trading this system recently only n I had put all my trades here with charts and TP which I made. You can call me a Conservative Trader in a sense that I am not Too greedy. I take TGT 1 TP with what little a/c balance that I have. I dont wait for days n weeks for my Tgt 2 and TGT 3 n so on. Now from this week I have added 1000 Dollars n I wont trade any other system EXCEPT the one I had attached here in the Guide Booklet. It is very precise, no here n there approach! No loss approach. I will be trading 0.05 lots around 150 dollars investment on one trade n we will see what profit we make in a week. Neither I am an accountant nor an Engineer, so pl. excuse me friends I can not calculate my wins in percentage etc. What I am interested is I DONT LOSE n I win however little it may be every week. Lets hope for the Best.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
The pdf made some interesting points about why inside bars form. Also the point about smaller IBs being more explosive and tradeable is good. If I have time I'm going to see how successful larger IBs have been. If larger IBs fizzle that would be a good filter. One larger difference is using the side of the IB to set SLs. I like using a fixed 30 pips. If the SL is hit and the signal still looks good I'd re enter a second time. Although for some pairs like GY 30 pips may be too small. Using IB box size to set TPs is something to think about. But I think Kelvin's main point in this thread was to cut losers fast and let winners run. So I like the idea of moving the SL up on a daily basis. And if you hit a ginormous amount of pips you can just close the trade and wait for the next trade. I'm also thinking about closing trades on Friday. The Sunday spikes are very unpredictable.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi all, behman, no worries on the math part.. figuring out %, ROI, etc. all u gotta worry about is the balance at the end of the week, month, year.. Actually, it is good to keep track of the floating loss (open float) as this is what causes margin calls if it gets too high. Even that, though, just keep your lots in proportion to your acc size and you should'nt have to worry.. it's not like u are trading martingale or something. I like to keep a trade log just to keep track of what I traded and a the result in pips won or lost. I then write down a simple win/loss record like this.. trades won / total trades taken. so for me and PTT this is 1/11 right now. nubchai, I hear u about the fri. close. I don't know if I like the idea of holding trades open over the weekend and risking any open profit gained to wild market opens, but that is the PTT method so I'll give it a good trial before I discard that part of it. I'll just keep track of what my balance would be if I had closed all open trades each fri. vs what I get by trading PTT.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I think the 25% thing is for traders who want to get in early. I will not be getting in early but waiting for the breakout of the high + 1 + spread for longs and low - 1 - spread value for shorts. Olu

--- 帖子 #186 ---
thanks for the help in understanding what those 25% lines were all about. Yeah, I don't think behman or any other trader here will try to use those or the multiple TP's. Is it just me or does trying to use those mutiple tp's not make such good sense, from a probability or margin point of view. Not to mention the extra time and effort one would need to put in. Or the psychological effects of taking more losses and such.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Probability perhaps, but not margin since it requires no more margin than first required. However, as since they are using 50, 25, and 25 % for the exits, if you only hit the first target every time, you need 2 wins for every loss, just to break even. If you hit the second target that offsets a little more than 1 loss because you moved your SL to the first target on the remaining 25%. If you do hit the 3rd target then you get 1.75:1 RR. In the PDF he actually moved his SL in one case to the 2nd target but only on the fourth day. I tested the GBPUSD for the last year, the one that got a whopping -23% loss in the first test, taking every IB except Sundays, and exit at every 1st target 1:1, with SL at the other end of the IB, and got a -8% loss for the year and about 40% W/L ratio. Also there were several spots where I got a 2nd IB while the first trade was open which resulted in 1 win, 1 loss for an offset but a US trader would not be able to take those trades because of the laws, with a few exceptions. Also, I did not take the 1 or 2 opportunities where there were 2 IBs in a row, I only placed 1 trade. Also, in at least one example in the PDF he placed his stop at the low of the outside bar before the IB, as mentioned in the Variation section, which might make more sense if the IB is quite small, since he says the smaller the IB, the better profit opportunities, but the smaller the IB, the closer the SL if you use the other end of the IB. Also, Alto, there are simple trade management EAs which could easily handle this multiple exit plan.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Behman, Many thanks. This is a good material to deepen this method

--- 帖子 #189 ---
you are very wel come!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
ericjschroed said 'Probability perhaps, but not margin since it requires no more margin than first required.' Ok, I understand margin used stays the same, but I was actually looking at it like this.. u would need to be in a trade longer as u waited for tp2 and tp3 to hit and therefore would have more of your available margin tied up for longer than if u just exited all al tp1. right? Also, I don't know what your broker's min lotsize is, but for me a micro lot is the smallest. I can only afford to trade with 1 micro lot and wouldn't trying to use 3 SL's like this require me to open each trade with at least 3 micro lots? 'I tested the GBPUSD for the last year, the one that got a whopping -23% loss in the first test, taking every IB except Sundays, and exit at every 1st target 1:1, with SL at the other end of the IB, and got a -8% loss for the year and about 40% W/L ratio.' Doesn't sound too promising. I hope behman and any others trying this method achieve a better result. Behman, u probably did some backtesting of your own? What results have u seen? Any pairs did real good or to avoid with this method? 'Also, Alto, there are simple trade management EAs which could easily handle this multiple exit plan' Yes, I like Hopwood's EA for this.. if I were to try it. I just took a look at my platform.. I was a bit scared that market might gap against my open trades and so I would be losing or worse, but it looks like the market favors PTT and all 3 of my open trades got a nice gap in the right direction. cool! I will be looking for new IB's and setting some stop orders. I think the idea is to add-on to existing trends and sunday bars serve to make good IB's for that, plus the market has most likely settled down by then and chosen to continue a trend or not.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
One thing to consider is that maybe it's not wise to trade all IBs. For example maybe smaller IBs or IBs that are no more than a certain % of the previous bar (e.g. 40%) would produce better results. I also think there may be merit to kevin's method of a fixed Sl of 30 instead of using the oposite side of the IB for SL.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi nubchai, I think u got me wrong.. I'm not actually using the IB method, at least not the same one as behman.. I am using IB's to set my stop orders like Kelvin lined out, but only in a strong, visible trend move. (only in the direction that agrees with 50ema and usually the pair shows a bounce off ema and/or some other obvious trendish PA) I do use the 30 SL on all 6 majors that I trade, plus a 50 SL on e/j and g/j. alto note: wow, got 6 open trades now and i'm sitting on $146 positive float, despite having 1 more small loss already today. so my record is 1/12. real tempting to close all now and take the profit. *seems as if I finally caught u/j on the move.. looks like another bounce down off the ema. only took me 4 tries!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
..so tempting to close some of these

--- 帖子 #194 ---
hi everybody has Kelvins thread been hi jacked, inside bar trading has been going on for eons.It should be kept simple, do we really need to read some one elses book on how to trade? i use a simple system and trade for a living but hey presto i wont be telling anyone how to use it. i also use another system very similiar to Kelvins and normally this goes in when the other doesn't i'm always on the lookout for other trading methods but like i keep insisting on keep it simple it pays

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Alto, I was really thinking more of Eric's backtest where he took all of the IBs. I agreethat Kelvin's strategy would seem to increase the probability of success. But I'm also wondering if you get that bounce off the 50 and the IB is really small if that suggests a bigger move. If that pattern was true then you could use it to maybe increase your lot size. Just thinking out loud.

hi guy, i've testing this method on demo account for the past 1 month and it seems that he method work. how ever i have a question. has anyone tested this method in different time frame such as H1 and H4.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hello All, Nubchai, sounds like an interesting tweak.. if u could figure out what correlation the size of an IB has, if any, to the size of the following move. Sounds like u would need to do some major backtesting to determine that, and lots of forwardtesting to cement your findings. For me, I just think IB's are an easy to spot, good place to enter already established trends and we are simply trying to ride/follow those trends until price stops us out. Now, kinda contrary to PTT thinking here, but last night I was watching my open trades and saw a $150 float.. I was tempted to close all, or at least the big winners, but decided that I should follow the PTT method. Anyway, I'm wondering if a global equity close of some sort should be used.. maybe at 10-20%? I know a monster trend is always around the corner (from what I read from people's trading experience, there comes 1 monster trend every few months or so.. by monster trend I mean 1000+ pips) After 1 of these monster trend moves come, I'm sure it's like in the youtube 'whipsaw' song.. 1 good trend pays for them all. but let me do the math here.. say we get an average of 10 small sl's per week, that's 40 sl's per month, and 120 every 3 months. ok, 120 x 30 pip sl = 3600 pips lost. Now let's say it's 1000 won for the monster move, plus 4 add-on trades.. for let's guesstimate a total of 2000 pip gained in total. now, my ej trade just stopped out for a 324 pip gain, so i'm guessing a trade like this might happen about every 2 weeks? (i'm being conservative here, but i'll just use that for now) so that's 300 pips per regular trend, 600 pips per month, and 1800 per 3 months. Add that to the 2000 from the monster move and we get 3800.. let's just call it 4000. So, if we take 4000-3600 = 400 (the total pips won in 3 months) now, that's a good profit i know, but hardly the ROI that can be had if we took 10-20% gains about every 2 weeks. For my little account, trading micro lots, that comes to $40 won shen using the monster trend way vs a possible $120+ when using the GEC method at 10% every 2 weeks. (actually, i started at $400 account, so $40 is 10%/month, not 2 weeks. I'm also not figuring out the compounding) Yes, we'll be leaving pips on the table by not following that monster trend to completion, but it might just be a more profitable way. Plus, we can still get back into that monster trend via the IB's. I think I've convinced myself, I'll be switching the the GEC method. Further convincing myself.. at least I'm not being as greedy by holding out for that monster trend to show up?? I know, not really.

I was looking at some of the posts regarding size of the inside bar in relation to the previous bar. I modded my original inside bar indicator to include a Percent_Prev value. I have it defaulted at 50. use integers in your input. this means that if the IB is less then or equal to 50% of the previous bar then it will be highlighted as a "good" IB. You can input any number from 10 to 100. If you put less then 10 it will default to 10 and if you input more then 100 then it will default to 100. The purpose was so nubchai or others could have a quick look to see if size of the IB matters. The other minor mod I made was to not colour Bar 0.

Thanks Flyer that's awesome!

NZD/JPY and USD/JPY stopped out overnight. NJ for +10 and UJ -30 pips. I'm trailing stops on the open trades using 15min S/R now.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi all, I've been thinking about and while I do feel that a close all (GEC) would not be following PTT as Kelvin detailed. On top of that, I was just looking at my open trades and would really hate to cut short what could be great trend trades. Another option would be to close some of the trades and leave some to grow more. The problem with this option is i would need to do some kind of further analysis or maybe close all the trades that have reached a certain pip level.. like close down those that reached 300+ pips. But can i really predict what the market is going to do? or which pairs will continue to trend or not? I don't think that would be very in line with trend following . right? So, despite my feeling of missing out or fear of sabotaging myself by interfering with the method, I will be setting a GEC using a simple close EA set at approx. 20% of accnt balance. I think it's good for me psychologically as well as financially to win like this and not stress about each trade turning and hitting SL and I lose many pips. I also feel that this way does follow PTT in that it is attempting to catch trends and follow them to a certain profit. What's everyone's opinion of my actions? alto:nerd: update: i had my close all EA set at 20% (of accnt bal), but one of my big trades (ej) stopped out and so i don't think open float would've hit that high of a %. I decided 10% was good enough (actually, more that I could've hoped) and so I had the EA close all at $40. My balance now is $454 from a start of $400 on 8/29.. not a bad ROI so far. Hope it keeps up.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I'm with you on this, Alto. I've tweaked Kelvin's exit rules to suit my style, but the essence of his method is intact. For example, the trades i posted taken on the 8th are now closed for +620 pips, which included two 30 pip losing trades. I'm now happy to wait for the next best setups, ideally daily IBs setting up from retests of the daily EMA(50), 2nd best will be re-entry IBs. Good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
good to hear sidefx, i had the same trades but closed them down a bit earlier than you, i do compound trade though so i hit close to an extra 300 pips, happy trading ,happy days

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi Alto, We'll never get the maximum pips in a run so i think taking a profit is a good idea. You might want to look into Steve Hopwood's trade manager. It has a GEC that you can set by pips or %. But it also has a partial close feature. It's been a while since I used it but you can set a jumping stop which moves your SL every "x" number of pips. And you can close a % ofyour position after an increase of pips e.g. price goes up 100 pips then you close 1/3 etc etc Hope this helps. Sandy

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Billy can you explain how you compound trade? Do you double your lot size when you win and reduce your lot size when you lose? Or are you scaling in multiple orders on each IB? Thanks very much. Sandy

--- 帖子 #207 ---
sidefx, Great numbers. I am still playing with this system and have not taken a trade (demo or live on it yet). I did notice that bounces around the 500 series numbers (1.40, 1.45 etc as per pair) tend to be good entries. The 500 series I use as a strong psyche level and any indecision (IB) around that level does seem to move strongly once the market decides which way it is going.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
If you're set on closing a trade to collect some pips, why not just move your stop up pretty close. If you get any retracement you'll be no worse off then if you had closed. If it moves in your favor keep trailing it and you'll pat yourself on the back.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Good points!, flyer415. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I agree that pips will always be left on the table but that is OK. I understood that kevin's original idea was to trail by 1 candle High/low for sell/buy. So in his own way he was not looking to capture everything but if he got a runner then the 1 candle trail kept him in.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
here is a modded grid overlay that I use to see the 500 series easily. I originally had it for 4 digit and I never changed it for 5 digit broker so use 5000 as Hgrid Pips and 200 for PipWidth. This will create a 20 pip buffer (+-20 pips) around the 500 series. That seems to be the width for most stop hunting exercises for brokers. If it pops through that grid then an entry is pretty easy.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Thanks for the indi.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hello Nubchai, i answered your question by private message. happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thank you Billy

--- 帖子 #215 ---
what do u mean by 'compound'? sounds good to me.. extra pips are all good! spyderman, thanks for the good idea about moving SL close vs just closing all. I think I want to experiment with the basket close (GEC), not thinking so much of each pair as a make it or break it trade. That way u could have 1 or 2 really good strong trend trades going and 1 or 2 not so strong trades that might be stalling or something, and still u would get the overall profit u want. I'm sure it all evens out.. i mean if u close each trade seperately or u do a close all. It's all about the accnt growth, right? Mostly I feel that I hate seeing a nice float one minute, and then see that shrink to half as much 3 hours later. Psychologically, I want to just close all, let my accnt take another 'step' forward, and move on with some new trades. I was thinking like this.. if u consider that u are simply setting a bunch of traps (pending orders) like u are hunting or fishing, and then periodically check those traps for any catches. Wouldn't u take all the winnings away from each trap, no matter how big or small, and just reset them? Yes, i realize trading is not the same as bear trapping or whatever, but i think the strategy could be used. alto

--- 帖子 #216 ---
morning Alto, compounding is using your winnings to increase your pip stake. T o keep it simple. When people double up when they lose also called martingale until they win, (crazy way) well we double up when we win,,,, simple . happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #217 ---
ok, i get it now. Thanks billytt for explaining it. Funny thing.. I was just looking at this MM/compounding software where u enter in you max risk, SL, etc. and then u put in how many pips u won or lost on your last trade. then is will calculate, using some algorithm, what lotsize u should use on your next trade. I think that would work real good on a higher winning % trade system because u could really benefit from such actions, but with PTT the wins are more rare and so if u increase your lotsize after a win, then wouldn't u probably get a loss on the next trade and so that increase in lotsize would hurt u more?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
i guess your right, i only compound when i chase trends and i very rarely lose i actually look at it like a game. My main trading way though is really freaky as i dont use any indicators only time. ps Kelvins thread is good just dont try to dissect ittoo much and keep it simple, happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I use the caterpillar EA for compounding a winning trend. Adds up nicely. You can search FF to find a thread explaining it. Here's the ea.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
ok billytt, thanks for that further info. Your trading method sounds very interesting. Maybe u will tell us more about it, or start a thread on FF and point us to it. and I will try to not mutate PTT too much.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I'd like to hear about it too

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I'm in AU short and AJ short. Also watching EJ short but it seemsto be consolidating soI'm waitingfor a break.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Dear Nubchai, i'm in too. Short AU at 1.0261 and AJ 70.01. something that is still bothering my mind, how do you exit the trade since PTT method does not have any exit rules. any information that you can share.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Cicak, Kelvin did lay out a way to exit trades.. as price moves, u just move your stop each day to the previous bar's high if you're short, and to previous bar's low if you're long. From there u just ride the trend as far as u can and let the market stop u out. Hope that was clear.. I attached a pic of my accnt now.. I think the most important thing to keep a close eye on is the max DD and max floating loss. I am comfortable with anything less than 20%, but would like to bring both down to single digits for a larger accnt. I have no choice but to trade 1 10,000 lot as its the minimum my broker trades.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
dear alto, thanks for the input. what if you put trailing stop at 50 pips and let it run untill it retrace. what do you think. just an idea.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi Alto, i apologise if i sounded like i said (you ) mutate or alter Melvins thread, I will often say you or we in type lol when infact i mean anyone else. so accept my humblest apology. Second thing when i was writing to you and another member early this morning i missed out on some pips and got busted lol so lesson learned. happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Well my AU stopped out. I had set the SL to BE+1 before I went to sleep. I closed out Aj this morning as it as also retracing close to the entry point. I reentered both positions. I am like Alto ..regretting the AU pips I left on the table last night This is still demo but grrr. And I know someone asked about the exit strategy. Alto has a good explanation. But if you read Kelvin's posts at the beginning he also lays out his exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
i picked up 60 pips this morning aud/usd i was after 40 but hey ho , i did get busted gbp/usd but that was my own fault lol happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Congrats Billy. Was GU a different kind of trade? I don't see a recent IB there. I need coffee...

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I took AU and AJ. Still in both. I had entered as 2 units. I close 1 unit at 30 pips (same as Sl) and let the other ride. If it retraces to my SL then I am still BE overall (less spread). On backtesting it seemed that the initial 30 pips was reached in a large percentage of the cases but no real stats on that yet.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
You may be traded your own rules which is fine, but just so as not to confuse those new to the thread...I don't think these trades are following Kevin's guidelines. The G/U, A/U and A/J are not currently trending in the right direction for those entries. A/U is in an uptrend so would only be traded long. A/J &amp; G/U are in a long term range and wouldn't be traded. Compare these to the G/J right now. (In which I am currently up 310 pips ) Zoom out on the daily and you see the direction. Price (for short) is below MA and bouncing off. Only enter in that direction. Just an observation...

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I use Oanda for charting as well as execution and as the daily candle close is 5am (UK), the only signal i had today was for a UJ short.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Agreed, good point.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
ok i'll have a coffee lol,i was expecting gbp/usd to raise at least 50 pips, i believe it hit 30 of them but i was typing to you and someone else lol. i would've taken 30 easy pips but not to worry i'll get them back tonight. do you adhere to kelvins way and only trade if the 50 ema is broken, just asking as we have a couple of ibs from yesterday happy treading happy days

--- 帖子 #235 ---
happy treading ??? freudian slip lol

--- 帖子 #236 ---
mmmm...coffee Remember, trend traders don't predict the market...we follow it.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
your right spyderman i did predict but i will get the pips back. getting back to kelvin , i took 50 pips today gbp/jpy that was following the ib of yesterday and i've reinvested it lol

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Congrats on that. I think G/J is a good PTT trade. I hope it keeps moving down so I can keep compounding. E/J is not bad either but I'd hate to get overexposed

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Spyder, AJ pa as under the ema 50 so according to Kelvin's rules that would be a short. Also i see a bounce off the the 50 5 or 6 days ago. For AU I do see the previous uptrend when I zoom out. But price broke below the 50 I'm not seeing consolidation in either ? I'll try to zoom your charts. I may be missing something. Kelvin did say a bounce off the 50 is the optimal trade so I agree there. Sandy

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Cream and sugar ? I do look at the 50. I also zoom out to get the larger view. I think the daily trend sort of leaps out at you. I know there's money to be made in countertrend trading but I really like to go with the trend.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
your right spyder just be careful with exposing ones self we may have ladies present lol. keeping with kelvin the trades are good but i get spooked with the stop loss its a night mare to me but i win.happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I think it's more than just being above or below the 50. That doesn't make a "trend". Here's an excerpt from Kelvin's post number 51. I wanted to take just a second and share my 2-step method for entering trades every day, in hopes that this might bring clarity to the method and stimulate further discussion if you would like. In this post I am sharing a screenshot of how I examine the market initially. At around 7:30 PM I begin looking through the different pairs. Because this is trend trading I have no interest in the name of the pair (other than to notice if I happen to be doubling up on a particular currency by using too many pairs of that currency). The way I examine the pair is to zoom as far out (using the magnifying glass with the - in it) as the MT-4 platform will allow. Once I get zoomed way out I do see the overall direction of the market. Some people like to look at a higher timeframe or two and that is a good method as well. However, I find that if I just zoom way out I can see clearly, at a glance, the overall direction of the market. I only want to trade those markets that are trending, in a clear direction (of course noting the retracements that all trends have) and have been for most of the viewable chart that I am looking at. As an example, in the screenshot of GBP/CHF where we have zoomed way out, we can clearly see that this pair has been in a downtrend for a long time (as have all pairs that have CHF at the end). So this, then becomes a viable pair to consider entering a trade. I write this pair's name down on my list of pairs to trade. And I keep examining pairs like this until I get a master list of pairs that all qualify to trade that particular day. In contrast to GBP/CHF, notice EUR/USD. While there are indeed some tradable trends, overall the market has been ranging for the full time available with this chart. Even more apparent does this become when viewing the pair over just the past few weeks to a month. It is clear that this is a ranging market, both in the longer timeframe and especially in the shorter. We want to avoid this market for now until a trend establishes itself clearly. So attached you will find the bigger picture of how I view the markets and pick each currency pair to trade for the day. The first chart is GBP/CHF and the second is EUR/USD. Thank you for reading and post any comments that you would like. Soooo...A/J is under the 50 but there's no trend there. Looking back at A/U there are times when it broke below the 50 but came back up to follow the trend. This current break may result in a new trend direction but then again that would be predicting. But again, everyone has there own technique.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
looks like a couple of nice trades could've been had with the aud/jpy re ibs, i wasn't on them though

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Spyder, O.k.I did take acloser look at GJ, AU and AJ and I see what you mean. GJ is clearly in a beautiful downtrend. Aj is more of a roller coaster. When I look at AU I see consolidation in Apr-May-June and then a break up back to the long term trend followed by a break down into another roller coaster movement. It would be surprising if AU didn't return to the upside eventually but likeyou said that would be predicting. Thanks for the insights.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Ya, there in comes the judgement part of this method. Deciding if there is a trend/overall direction, strong enough to trade, after you get the IB. Personally I took the AU because even though zoomed out the pair is overall long, it is below the 50 and has made a couple of lower highs. To me, even if it doesn't continue short for a long trend, it looks strong enough to possibly get some decent pips from. Correction, I actually went in by accident sunday night, thought I saw an IB before I realized the candle had yet to close. So Im in from. 1.0401 with my current SL about 26 0r so pips postive. P.S. I have noticed though looking over charts that a lot of the trades that end up moving the best start off from or very close to the 50 as kelvin said.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yeah, it's all very subjective, reading what is and isn't a trend. And you're right dragon, sometimes there are times when you can grab a few pips. For me, I'd like to find a way to trade some long term large trends that I can caterpillar (compound) on and then ride for a while. I would like to find a system that I don't have to monitor all the time. I'm sure hoping this PTT from Kelvin works out to be that.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
No prob. I'm just excited that I might finally have a system I can wrap my mind around and fits my personality. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Once in profit and locking in my SL behind the last high/low of the daily is working pretty well for me and taking all the stress out of it. Already had one trade last week make me +300 or so a few losses and bunch of small wins. Much better than looking at smaller time frames and S&amp;R and trying to guess is it going to pass here? is it going to pass here? P.S. currently up 63 on UJ and 182 on AU, with small pips locked in on both. I hope they both give me some big short candles before friday so I can lock in some good profit.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi all, I'm also only in on gj right now. I think that is an obvious PTT trade. I think the other pairs don't show such a defined trend.. well, i do think ej is trending good. Anyway, Kelvin kinda layed out the 'if price is above 50ema, then look for long.. if under, look for short'. so the actual determination of a bonafied trend is kinda left up to each trader. I also think we're not supposed to try and spot a trend, but just look for IB's and enter according to price above/below ema. He did also mention the retrace and bounce off of ema, but he never said that was a hard rule of the method. For me, I like to see a bounce but do try to get in on a trend that looks like it broke some sort of trend line, such as a head&amp;shoulders, double top, etc. billytt, no worries. I know I have added my share of confusion to this method and am messing with PTT some. I also know there are others who have suggested a totally different method here and it all serves to totally confuse sometimes. Overall, I think the spirit of PTT is still here and I hope that can last. ps. That damn uj.. I already got faked out by it 4 times, so this time i put in my pending order at what appears to be a channel support line. It made an IB yesterday and has now shot down through that. I shoulda stayed the course and followed the IB method. Oh well, live and learn..

--- 帖子 #250 ---
a big congratulations on that one. you can't argue with common sence. keep it comming!

--- 帖子 #251 ---
what are they?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Alto, You might want to reread Kelvin's post #51. It really helped me see how to look for the trend.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
You want to talk about an obscure pair...I've got a buy stop in on the USD/TRY. Heck I don't even know what that is... but it's trending with an IB.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
too much spread on usd/try is it worth it? you ask yourself!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Buy Stop usd/cad 0.9940 SL 0.9844 TP 1.0025 Sell Stop 0.9842 SL 0.9942 TP 0.9755. Good Luck! Lets see what this will bring us.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
You may be right behman... About the USD/TRY that is, not the U/CAD...

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Is this tradable according to the rules? Olu

--- 帖子 #258 ---
If you're referring to the U/Cad...not by Kelvin's rules. It's nowhere near an uptrend.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
If todays d1 candle doesn't break past the last, before close, it's an IB, but I'd be careful with this pair. Zooming out and looking at the big picture it's pretty much in a wide range. And it's already about 300 pips short past the 50, so it might just retrace up to it. So, just going short because it's below the 50, might not be such a hot idea IMO. It could work out for either a long or short, but there isn't a very strong trend either way. If you limit your risk to 30 pips and .5 percent, it might be worth a try. That's the real strenth of this method is the low risk/small stop loss, as when you do catch a big winner it outstrips the losers a lot.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
would you be happier with nzdcad? Olu

yessir...up 350 right now. Hope it keeps falling.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
guys, what brokers are u on? My charts are very different, i think. I am on mbt. Or i guess it is just mbt's server time and for me an IB formed on the 10th. ps. i just looked up the usd/try.. turkish lira. who knew.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
..missed the entry yesterday, but just in on the retrace.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
...this cross is currently battling with the strong demand level printed back in March (see circle on chart), i'll give the short a go if offered.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
i go short too, cad-jpy

--- 帖子 #271 ---
C/J and N/J are still too rangy for me. I keep going back to that zoom out. I hope it works out for you. Alto, I have two live accounts. One is with MBT and the other FXDD. I'm currently trading PTT on FXDD. (what's with all these acronyms... ) You're right though...you're going to get different daily IB's with different brokers. I like FXDD because their new day starts at 4 pm my time. Good time of day for me to review the upcoming IB's and make decisions. MBT day starts at midnight for me and that kind of throws things off a bit.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
hy spyderman! which pair of trade you just?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I'll trade just about any pair as long as it lines up with Kelvin's guidelines as per page 1 and post #51.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
..stopped out for -30. Short order reset at same level. The chart hopefully shows why i'm shooting at this one, despite not being as smoothly trending as i'd like.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
This is a good example of what Kelvin's trying to do with this system. Here's a zoom out of the N/J. The range is pretty dramatic since 2009. Now you may well get movement down on your short. Then again it may move up. That's really the point. There's no trend here to indicate where the market has been going. We're just guessing at that point. There's resistance you highlight at 55 but there's also shorter term resistance at 62 and 63. Just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Good points. Of course, the EMA(50) becomes more or less redundant if zooming out that far, but i take your point ...and as i said, i had recognised that this wasn't an 'ideal' trending setup, but the demand level from March strikes me as a 'gimme'. Just my opinion

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yeah I think you're right there. The ema is more for determining a good entry off the bounce once you've established the pair to trade based on the trend. You may have a downward trend but PA goes above the ema short term...maybe it's a trend reversal...maybe not. Best to wait until price falls back below the ema then look for your IB entry.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Now THAT's a range! Very dramatic. Another thing I wonder about is if IBs taken earlier in the week have more momentum potential than IBs toward the end of the week. Just something else I haven't researched lol.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
hi traders how are we doing

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Personally, unless it looks really good I wouldn't take an IB trade after wednesday. (by real good I mean a strong obvious trend and the IB is right at the 50 line) Because friday is volatile, rampant stop loss hunting and end of week profit taking from the big boys. Also, my broker is closed from 3 pm friday until sunday evening. And there can be a gap. So, if the trade didn't move much after it entered I very well could just get gapped out. I've also noticed that often the IB's are more plentiful on sunday evening as the markets dont move a whole lot over the weekend. So, IMO most set ups are going to happen S,M, and T,W would be the lastest I'd look for an entry.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
evening all, it looks like we may have an ib on aud/usd in a few hours time.i believe a lot of people here are in the USA and i go off london trading times. i am just saying this as i have seen a few graphs/charts and they dont correspond with mine. happy trading happy days

I tried to go back and run a manual visual test but it's almost impossible. You'd have to drill down to the M1 to see if you ever hit your initial 30 pip s/l. The first two I did though were both on Thursday...one for +200 pips (multi day compounded) and one for -30 pip s/l.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I haven't traded this system on Sundays. But it does make sense that the big money moves in at the beginning of the week and closes out toward the end. Profit taking and all.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi Billy. Yes looks like an IB will form on AU. Also maybe AudCad. Sandy

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Yes it's hard to viually back test something like that. But you had a winner on Thursday...hmmm.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Good evening sandy, yes well spotted aud/cad i shall take a look at it. i made a serious blunder last night, it was a school boy error of great magnitude anyway i've stopped crying now. i actually put my 2 trades on using the blackberry and as i couldn't see too well i fouled up big time. i lost a heap but hey ho i crawled some back to day. i ought to start a new thread up about being stupid lol. Anyway i've good 3 trades coming up hopefully including your aud/cad i'll see what haappens. happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Had one close today that opened last Friday...yikes...made about 250 pips total.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Awesome. That's encouraging and blows my theory that maybe IBs in the beginning of the week are stronger than later in the week.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Aw sorry about the blunder. I've done the same thing. I usually submit my trades through scripts and there've been a few times I've had the wrong lot size set. One time it worked in my favor but another time it was very ugly Hang in there. You'll make it back. Sandy

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi guys, Yeah, mistakes happen all the time.. there is about a 1% chance that I will enter all my stop orders correctly. I always forget to choose 'buy/sell stop' from the mt4 order window. I get that dong, u're stupid sound from the pc speakers and then have to go back and try again. This last time my 3 yr old son was sitting next to me and laughed when the sound came.. made me feel like a real smart, wise trader. edit: about the whole taking trades late in the week thing.. The weekend might gap back in the wrong direction and hit your SL, but we only need about 1 in 10 trades to pay off by catching a strong trend move, so all the little losses would not matter in the big picture and we only need 20% or so winning trades. Last week was a good example when I was worried that I would lose due to market gap, but i got a gift and the market gapped in favor of all my open trades.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hi guys /gals have a good weekend, i'm glad to hear that its not only me blundering lol. at least we are honest and i think that helps to work in our favour, happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Good morning. I took the AU trade last night on demo. It's currently up 43 pips. I'm going toleave itopen to see what the Sunday gap does. Also Steve Hopwood put an ea together for this method. Here's the thread. EA is on the first page. It's semi-automated. So you find a pair with an IB. You zoom out to see the trend. If it looks good and there's been a bounce off the 50 you drag the EA onto the chart. It places the trade and manages it. I just found this last night so I'm not clear how much help the EA will really provide. Have a great weeknd!

--- 帖子 #293 ---
doesnt work and i doubt it'll ever get fixed to, so be careful with it sandy

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks for the heads up Jim

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Ooops I fotgot to add that I took the AU trade long when it's under the 50. So definitely not a Kelvin trade

--- 帖子 #296 ---
the ea will do that for you, so maybe you CAN use it even better if you want the stoploss to be set at random, instead of 30 pips like you set it

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Oh terrific! Lolol Well this method is better done manually and it's certainly not a big time commitment. So I'll keep doing it manually

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Guys, There are IB on eur/usd, Gbp/usd (Pinbar) and Gbp/jpy. Also Aud/Cad Pinbar!

--- 帖子 #299 ---
guys, I want to read more about the caterpillar method, but cannot find the right thread. Is there a specific one that describes and talks about it? Thanks, alto

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Check out the caterpillar section in this guide for another trading system.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
thank you spyderman, I understand it and I like the visual of the caterpillar as it moves along. I guess u could have 2 or more caterpillar sections that move their SL's along with PA. I'm happy with using just 1 SL and following 1 bar behind till price stops me out, but wonder if 2 or more SL's, spaced a certain distance apart, would let us take the SL on any retrace, but also keep us in a trade as the trend continues. Hmmmm.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Yeah, exiting strategy is definitely a hard one for me. There's obviously no perfect answer...it depends on the particular trade at hand, but what you're talking about has merit. Lock in some pips but still have room for further movement.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Another possibility is to use a trade manager with jumping stops and partial closes. As an example you could use the trade manager to move the stop to BE +2 after 50 pips. Then you could use a jumping stop of 75 pips after BE had been achieved. And you could set it to close 50% of the position when 150 pips had been hit. Hopwood's trade manager does all of that.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I like the IB on Eur/Gbp. I know it's rangy when you zoom out. But it looks poised to bounce down off the 50.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
And there is an IB on E/J as well.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I never used to like how the market gaps open on sundays, but they do seem to favor this method. at least recently. u get to put in a stop order on fri. and if the market gaps in the right direction.. not only does it trigger, but your trade is already in profit. I like it.

Hey there, this thread uses 3sma instead: 30, 50, 100 in good alignment. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=208630

--- 帖子 #309 ---
How about a the use of the size of the average daily range as SL? Since most USD pairs are 100 pips in adr, use SL as 100 pips. Care to backtest this on a few pairs?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Curious, i wonder if you setup a subaccount with the express and sole purpose of trading a failed inside bar that returned to entry point. Wonder how that will stack up.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Vary interesting method K. I like the simplicity of trading with the trend.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi all, I was just thinking about the use of a set 30 pip SL vs using 100+, ATR SL.. U could argue that an ATR SL makes good sense cuz it is more dynamic and adjusts to the current market, plus it will get hit less often. Then I started thinking about expectancy.. if the sl is 30 and the average pip gain of a good trend move is 300, then that is a 1:10 RR, or an expectancy of 10. If we instead use a sl of 100, or so based on ATR, then using that same 300 for a good move, we get a much smaller 1:3 RR, or expectancy of 3. I wonder how that would translate into real world results? Is it better to take many small losses (30 sl) or a bigger sl hit less often (ATR sl)? In my experience, the bigger the sl, the better the win/loss, but also the greatr any loss can really hurt an accnt. I know of several huge or even no sl ea's/systems who win 99% of the time, but then bust with just 1 or 2 losses. I also learned that, no matter how good the system, no matter how often it wins, there will come a time when u will face a losing streak.. like 10 in a row.. and so it would be much better at that time to have a system with a smaller sl set. Just using the #'s from earlier, 10 losses X 30 pip sl = 300 pips vs 10 losses X 100 pip SL = 3000 pips. Of course, I am not saying the same thing would happen to both methods (using different sl) I also think it would even out in the long run and the pips won/lost overall would not differ too much. In the end, I think it's up to each trader to decide how they will trade and why. alto update: I had another 10% wash (GEC) on my accnt. cool!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Here is a detail actual live trading journal: danUk trend trading journal. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=143593 He average 1000 pips. Here is january results http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...00#post2509900 you can check results at the end of every month and you can see the trades in their development. It just makes sense to me to use the average daily range of the pair as SL...and, if i am using the daily time frame as entry....my average profit target will generally be more than 300 pips if i am riding the trend for as long as possible. I will expect profit in the higher 100s and lower thousands. of course, this is just my opinion, and to be honest, i dont think inside bar setups are robust(in my humble opinion). But, hey, whatever works for you. Just my two cents on this methodology.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi dddd, yes, that guy danuk sure can trade. Thanks for pointing to those threads. It's good to see that this type of trading really does work, and works well, for others, too. I have seen others who use psych levels in their trading, and it does make a lot of sense.. do u also use these levels in your own trading and what are your results? I think that trading with the trend is a common thing in FX and other trading venues and we all hear 'the trend is your friend' and similar things, but it is finding a method which makes sense to u and that u can actually do and remember that is one of the hardest parts. I am glad for any trader that can find a way to profit. For me, PTT is much easier to grasp.. the strategy and its implementation.. compared to all the other methods I've seen. (trend following or other) I am glad to have found it now (only took 11 years of trading/failing) and I hope to keep it up.. alto

Hello Kelvin, I tried this system yesterday with good results.Maybe was a very easy day, i foud 3 setups eurusd,audusd and usdcad.Take only the audusd, moved about 80 pips.I move my SL to b/e +10 pip and got hit late night. When do you move your SL ? You take 50+ pips or just leave the trade? Green pips to everybody!

Hi billy, I guess u are trading some kind of IB straddle with small tp's or else your chart must be very different from what I got. For me, it's been only many 30 pip losers so far. Guess this is the 'whipsaw' part, huh? No worries though, the other pairs have more than made up for it.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
post 274 explains why i persisted with the NJ IB despite a weaker trending chart....this in mind i'll be trailing stops slightly tighter than standard Kelvin. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
with u/j this month i've had approx 200 pips using ib and approx 200 pips the other way i trade. The ib way is very similar to Kelvins way. as an example on the 7th sept uj high 7764 and low 7707,,,,,on the 13th sept the uj was high7725 and low 7680,,,, thats what my broker charts say, i do go off middle prices as well. its a pity we cannot all see the same thing. happy trading happydays

--- 帖子 #325 ---
cool, billy, can u tell us about this 'other way' u trade? it sounds like its a good way to trade channels/ranges when the trend just refuses to go.. alto edit: well guys (and gals if any are lookin) I decided to wrap up my live trading for this month. My accnt gained 25% since starting PTT on 8/29. I am still demo trading to try and practice some more. I've noticed that my trade pattern is 8-10 losses until I hit enough good trend trades to hit my 10% wash. (I did cheat a bit and set my last wash so I can get a nice round $500 as my acc bal.) So lose approx 300 pips to end up winning approx 400-500 pips. In my case it was take a 6-8% hit to end up winning 10% (of balance of accnt before any trading). Hope I didn't screw things up by stopping early, but taking profit and not worrying about losing profit earned already, just feels right. edit edit: Hmmph, I set a bunch of trades just before I wrote the above edit, and already it's up $37. That coulda helped out my little accnt. Oh well, it's always easy to make demo dollars..

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Morning from UK, Hi Alto good luck with live trading.The other way i trade is ahem( looks around room) a secret. I do give clues such as i go off specific times not news etc and i will raise my stakes following a loss if i have one. i trade the way we are told not to. If i opened a thread as to what i do i would probably be taken apart by the so called good traders but i win consistently. Kelvins thread is a good way and as he says it can be tweaked to your own style. some advice if your nervous dont keep watching your trade once its made just let it roll. i make more money when i am not watching lol and i get edgy and shut my trades too early when i do. happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks billy, That's good advice.. about not watching your trades 24/5. I am guilty of that.. well, at least i check em about every hour or so. U can just talk about your secret way of trading whenever u feel like sharing. No pressure. As for my decision to go on demo now.. wouldn't u know it, the prices really took off in their expected trend directions (based on ema) and, despite 2 small losses, are up $60! I was wondering if there is some indie or ea that will keep track of the highest open float achieved. I know that global variables keeps track of largest floating loss, but how do we also keep track of largest floating gain.. for example, if open profit hit $62 at it's highest, I want a way to see $62 reported as the high float since the indie/ea was started. Just picking here, but it would be nice to squeeze out another % or 2 on top of my 10% wash. hope I was understandable, good trading all, alto

--- 帖子 #328 ---
alto, account sentry will track your floating loss and profit. I think i've sent it to u before, but shout if not.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Friends, There is an IB on eur/gbp daily today. I am long at 0.8780, TP 0.8841. Pl. express your opinion.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
it is a valid IB. How did you enter? My charts dont show a topside breakout... Olu

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Olu, at 4 pm est new york mkt close, daily showed top as 0.8785 and low as 0.8707, so according to my theory we go long, also note hammer candle with long tail so it will go up. You can see all this in my chart if you magnify it!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
yes I see it... Olu

--- 帖子 #333 ---
hi alto, i cannot really help you with what you asked. i keep it all simple if i have to think about something i discard it lol. Someone just mentioned the eur/gbp being ib, i have it here as well i may just take a trade after checking it out.Your uj is currently freaking me out but i'm managing to rake some pips in the hard way. happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #334 ---
The 50 EMA is pointing lower. I have order to go short @ 8708.00 at the low of yesterdays IB.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
yes your right zall, i might leave it due to it looking dodgy but who am i to say lol. there are a few others pending, happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #336 ---
going Kelvins way the eur/gbp was the ideal set up with the high starting after 50 ema but obviously its dipped, another kelvin set up looks like the eur/cad but with the weekend approaching it might be difficult to follow, happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi all, have a good weekend everyone. I am finding it quite hard to sit it out till next month, but at least there's demo. I put the sentry ea on there to watch what the max floating profit was and it hit $72. I'm reading "Trend Commandments" and it's good, because of all the trend trading talk, but I find it a little hard to read and it's slow going.. I think cuz it jumps around alot and is more like the author's rant on why trend trading is so good.. and btw, it is. I find myself rethinking some of my trading while reading and have decided to just use a 30 sl on every pair.. even gj. Let's see if it makes a difference or not..

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Guys It seems to me there are always lots of I/Bs on a friday as markets slow down and close early. So how do we handle this? Do we put pending orders in just before market close or do we wait and see where price is on market open on sunday and go straight in with market order if price has gapped above/below I/B? Would be very interested to get views from people who are still trading this system. For my part am trading this using a very small real money account with 0.01 lots, made over 600 pips last week. Kind Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Alto I missed it. Why are you sitting out the rest of the month? Do you have a monthly % you shoot for? Excellent will power if that's the case sandy

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hello Sandy and all, I guess the reason I chose to wait it out till next month is bcuz I am very satisfied with my ROI so far, I don't want to mess things up and lose some (This is my first real go at manual trading.. even though I've been live with ea's and have tried several manual systems on demo before) I feel kinda like I started running downhill a bit too fast and so I need to slow down and catch myself now. Also, I want to force some self discipline on myself by NOT trading, even when I am soooo tempted to do so. Geoff, I have always felt that an IB is really just a good, convenient, easy to spot place to enter into a trend and that's why it works for this method. I think one of the goals is for us to catch or get into a nice trend move. I even imagine how a surfer will put himself (or herself) in front of a wave and then try to get up and ride that wave. So, if u feel that there is a good trend move happening and u also see an IB (on any day, even friday right before market close or on sunday) then I would go ahead and place a stop order.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi alto, howz things. I'm using blackberry so can't really say much lol.I picked up a few pips sun/mon. Good to see nubchai I thought you' come into money and left us lol, happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi guys, just wondering if anyone has tried this technique with 4h candles? Assuming we still have a trending market (shown by a sloping ema and or visual higher highs or lower lows) I think this simple inside bar break out method could still be effective....we would need to have tighter stops though..Im going to back and forward test live with very small lots on Oanda .

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Quick question to Kelvin or anyone who can advise. The rules state that when the inside bar breaks in the direction of the trend, reverses and hits the stop, we should re enter the next time time it comes back to our original break out point... The problem with back testing this on daily bars is that its very easy to see that the stop loss would have been hit at some point (if the trade fails) but in 1 day how often does price straddle the entry point? We are supposed to re enter the next time price comes back to the low or high of an inside bar (depending on trend direction) but what it price is ranging around that area? That could mean a A LOT or 30 pip stop losses in 1 day.... Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
If it were me and i saw price ranging around a 2nd attempt on the same IB, i'd pass on it. If however, the 1st IB stoploss was taken out on a retrace to support/resistance, which then gets rejected and price heads once again to the IB breakout, i'd def take it, these signals are often the strongest. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi all, billy, it's cool how we can get online using so many different forms of tech. Do u also trade sometimes from your blackberry? Alseobang, I agree with sidefx in that the same entry point should be taken off an IB.. although I do look at things like support/resistance, they are only further confirmation for me and the trend or move within that trend is the only thing that should matter. If it is a strong trend move that I can see (like gj right now), then I would do the re-entry dance no matter how many 30 pip losses come. If the chart looked more range/channel (like uj right now), then I would move my pending stop order to just under the channel support t-line. A good trend trade can be 300 pips, or 1000 pip, maybe even more. So we are not even concerned over a 30 pip loss.. trend trading has a 10+ expectancy.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi alto, yes I trade with blackberry if I have to.last week or so I lost 2000 through school boy error lol. I have since recouped my loss. Blackberry ok but just be careful I have old eyes and fingers lol. Re re entering trades its mainly luck and exoeriance if you have the feeling. Happy trading happy days, see ya soon

--- 帖子 #347 ---
@ alto ah that makes sense. It's a good exercie in self control too. Over trading as killed many accounts. @billy yes I'm still here lol. I've been neglecting IBs a bit. I have the week off and was having fun trading the EU up and down, up and down today. Was also reading up on pin bars and some other candle reversal patterns. Happy pips! Sandy

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Good to hear off you sandy, I'm away on the boat for a few days but I got the blackberry lol. It makes the world a smaller place. And I'm being extra careful using the blackberry lol. I've been hanging around a different ff site as I find it amusing and so many contradictions anyway I got 3 trades today none ib though, take care. Happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Have fun Billy! But be careful with that Blackberry Are you on a sailboat by any chance? I saw a video of a captain who was sailing a sailboat toward a bridge that his mast wouldn't clear. He had 2 sandbags tied to the mast. He leaned the boat to the right until the sandbags were dragging through the water. The boat was at 45 degree, maybe more. It lowered his mast enough to clear the bridge . Amazing to see

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi sandy, sail boat it isn't ,they too much like hard work. I got a motor launch and no I didn't see the sail boat video but it stands to reason it could be done. Hany way take care all hope the pips come in like the tide

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks sidefx and alto, what you say makes a lot of sense. Re entering based on whether price hits support or resistance is where the discretionary part of this system comes in to play. I will consider this a lot more careful in my forward testing. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
i'm back, hope all you traders are making plenty of pips, i'm up about 260 this week after a loss yesterday of 40 pips i just put a quick one on gbp/usd. i will check ib later and maybe hopefully strike anyway happy trading happy days

Hi all, I just finished reading 'Trend Commandments'. I learned some good stuff, but most of it I'd read before. The best part was seeing the actual results for several trend followers. The results shown cover 12-30 years and are broken down into months, then the annual ROI. The traders he writes about are the big, big traders from the little millionaire guys to the $billion traders. I might get his other books to read more about the turtle traders and other trend followers. alto

--- 帖子 #357 ---
On my Oanda account there are now daily inside bars on the following. GBPUSD EURJPY GBYJPY (you could also argue there is also one on the USDJPY but its at seriously major support and I dont fancy shorting in to that). These are all trending pairs and the inside bar has formed during a retracement. The only problem is we are a little bit far from the 50EMA. I have 20EMA on my charts as well to show the momentum of price away from the 50ema and the inside bars on these pairs have just come off it. Lets see what happens.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Got up to see the gbp broke out of the ib to the downside but has retraced and is moving up nicely. So we do need to be wary about trades too far from the MA. Now I also read on the thread that if stopped out of a trade (not that I traded it) to put in the trade again and wait. Two questions. Is what I read true? and for how long should the stop order be in - the day the week?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Here's the site for Covel's stuff on trend following in case anyone wants to look.. again, the results shown on there are pretty awesome.. trendfollowing.com Olu, I think Kelvin said that we should re-enter any stop order over and over again as for as long as it takes. We are working with a 10+ RR, so a few 30 pip losses are nothing to worry about. I have tried and lost with uj 6 times, but still I have set a stop order just under support. The winners that u do catch make up for all the little losers and then some. ie. If uj triggers my sell-stop 10 times, but I catch eu for 350 pips, then I am still ahead and it's the confidence of taking all those little 30 pip losses that makes way for the good trades. Can't wait to start up live again next week. Seems like I got lucky and chose a good week or so to sit out, cuz the total floating profit only got up to $41.. not enough to hit my 10% wash and close all. I didn't keep track, but I'm pretty sure this was a losing week overall. Still, the month would've ended about 17% up had I traded.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I've got a stop in on the G/J...actually my 2nd order after being stopped out on my first last evening. I'm just not seeing that trend in the G/U though :nerd:

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi Guys I've read through the thread and I like it ! I'm currently watching 17 pairs and have seven orders waiting. I would love to hear about your results, you know things like how many times has your 30pip stop been hit in a row, average pip gains etc..... I wonder where KelvinM has gone. The only thing I have added to help me with exits ( i'll still use the stoploss moving method) is to add a 10 ema and I'll exit when a bar closes on the other side of it. It doesn't matter if price spike through and retraces, only if it closes on the otherside. I think the stoploss would normally have taken me out of the trade by then, but its just a backup.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
...not a classic Kelvin but i like the channel it's in and the rejection of the MA and upper channel line. I know it won't be for everyone, but for me it's worth a punt short, from the 27th Sept IB ( Oanda ), to test the lower line of the channel as a 1st target zone.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
i've only been forward testing since 6th Sept (across 16 pairs): Win Rate: 52% Consec W = 4 Consec L = 5 Largest W = 300 pips Largest L = 70 pips (order error!), usually max 34 pip stop. G/L = 12.5% I don't use the Kelvin exit of trailing behind daily highs/lows, as i'm looking for shorter term moves (+300 pips) and use the 15min to look out for the more significant reversals that might develop against the trade.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
So what type of exit strategy are you using now.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Yes, to me this appears to be a definite trend channel.. We also have the text book definition of trend visible which is lower highs and lower lows so I can see why shorts look good here even though the 50ema isn't really sloping down too much. You will either get in very early on a nice down trend or it will keep ranging sideways. All should be clear soon enough. The 27th daily bar is an inside bar on Oanda so a limit sell would be well worth a punt on the break of that.

If you zoom out a bit GU is definitely in a down trend but I think I know what you mean, the retracement over the last week has been too much and maybe its the beginning of an up trend. Technicially it is below the 50ema and we dont have higher highs and higher lows yet so I would still say the down trend is intact. It may be the way Oanda is printing on my chart though.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
As a trade progresses I use the 15min to look out for reversals (typically 123s), but not just any old reversal. If i see a reversal forming at a strong demand/supply level, regardless of pip count at that stage, i'll move the stoploss to 10 pips above /below the 123 pattern. I'd say the screentime I have provides me with the edge i need to do well with this strat, the risk mngt is sorted; not giving too much back on a winner is what makes the difference imho. Hope this makes sense....had a few beers!

PTT started on 8/29 starting bal: $400 ending bal: $500 ROI for month: 25% Win Rate: 18 won/47 closed = 38% (not so high as sidefx) Consec W = 8 Consec L = 3 Largest W = 325 pips Largest L = 50 pips (from now on i'll use set 30 pips) I do use Kelving's jumping 1-bar stops, but most often close all when open float is at 10% accnt gain. I think to be true to trend following we should only take with the trend trades (agrees with ema) and we should almost always be in the market(never know when price will take off).. buy when price is rising, sell when it is falling. This is my first go at some live, manual trading so I hope I can stay with it and make some profit.. I am so glad I 'discovered' trend following and PTT. (actually I think I've been learning parts of PTT always, but the low win%, non-flashy style, not complicated enough strategy never made it to the list in lieu of all the many double-your-accnt-in-a-week, super martingale/progression ea's or hyper scalpers.)

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I've moved my stop to Break Even. How do the rest of you handle this ? It's only because I've gone and looked at the trade before the Daily bar has closed.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
morning traders hope your all making pips, hi Alto good to hear off you , nice to see your keeping records it does help long term and (should) you lose you'll have a history to look over. happy trading happy days

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Alto great results! What risk percentage do you use per trade? thx PC

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Morning all, billy, thanks for the nice words. pipcruiser, I use a set .01 lotsize to trade. (on mbt it's actually .1 lots, but still means 1 micro or 10k lot) I didn't realize how much the different pairs are worth different amounts.(i mean the pip values) I guess I never paid attention since I used mostly EAs and only looked at ROI, max float, etc. So, on my $400 account and using either a 30 or 50 SL, this comes to 1-2.5% per trade. I will be using only a 30 pip SL from now on, no matter what pair.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Well I'm quite pleased with my first few days trading this system. My Usd/Cad trade was closed out for +107 pips. Gbp/Usd = -30 Eur/Usd = -30 Back in on E/U presently at = +20 Eur/Gbp so far @ = +78 Usd/Chf so far @ = +59 Eur/Jpy so far @ = =30 I did think of closing all my trades out on Friday, but decided to let them run and see how the system coped. I think I'll move the stops to BE on the E/G &amp; U/C trades on Monday.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
congrats simmo24 hope those trades continue to produce pips for u.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi simmo could u tell me what moving averages you have on your screen shot please...many thanks

--- 帖子 #376 ---
The yellow is the one KelvinM told us to use in post one, the 50Ema. The blue is a 21 simple MA which i use to determine the trend, if the 21 ma is flat I won't trade. The red is a 10ema which I'll use to exit the trade if the jumping stop method hasn't already taken me out.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I am wondering if this system is working so well because of the system itself or because all the markets are dropping due to the fundamentals of what is going on at the moment. Im testing this with a 1% risk per trade on a small account and in the last week my account is up 6%. I would normally use 2% risk but I thought if this style has 7 losses and 2or3 wins for every 10 trades, at 2% a trade you could very quickly see over 10% loss of your account before you had profit..eeek!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi All Current trades are doing well.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi all, Alseobang, I was just going to post about the DD/max floating loss that I get on my accnt. While the actual DD i usually see is about -8%, the float is approx. -10.5%. In fact, I reset my global variable after each series of trades that gives me a good 10-20% gain, and it's kinda eerie that the numbers right now are exactly the same as what I saw on my first run with PTT..

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Interesting. Which broker are you using right now? Im not sure if I can do that with my Oanda. I had a good run last week but so far this week there haven't been any good daily insides. I wondered if you considered using the same risk management but extended the entries to breaks of pin bars as well?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi all, I use MBT as my broker and mt4 as the platform. Oanda also has mt4, right? Alseobang, what is it that u wonder if u can do with oanda? I do take note if IB's, but mostly just put a stop order in front of price when I see a trend. I'm not sure what u mean by 'pin bar'.. Is that a sort of candle formation?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi alto, I meant the graph at the bottom of your chart...am I right it is showing 2 different test results you have done using this method? I may have misunderstood. The pin bar is basically a reversal bar that I use to to trade after price has retraced and about to resume moving in the direction of the daily trend. I find these are quite reliable when they occur at support/resistance (do a quick google on them if you arent sure). Hope you trading is going well this week! Are you in any trades at the moment?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I get it now.. actually, that graph at the bottom of the pic i posted is part of the equity indie i use. It shows the balance (yellow line) and the equity/float (blue line). Just let me know if u need that indie and i can post. I'm in on u/chf right now. It's the only one open. I think I will try to focus more on just the IB's from now on. Look for price coming off a retrace and re-joining a trend.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
There are a number of daily inside bars that formed yesterday. EURJPY, GBPJPY and USDGBP. They are not bouncing of the 50ema as this system says but they are faily close to my 20ema. The 20ema hasnt been breached so Im taking shorts on these pairs as close as I can to it. Problem is tomorrow is the NFP release and so these inside bars may have just formed because they are waiting for the results....still, Kelvin says that the news is not a reason to stay out of these trades (doesn't he?).

--- 帖子 #385 ---
hi guys i hope your tradings going ok. I have posted here a few times and i do trade a very similar system to Kelvins. i personally dont listen to news even though it does have an impact. i think if you start listening it is adding an extra burden to kelvins way

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I've been watching UJ for some time now as it hugs the bottom (daily chart) - does anyone else see the huge descending triangle/wedge in play?...i have an order in short now to test the theory, lots of daily IBs to get in from in recent weeks on that chart. Good trading guys.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
it looks good on my chart too u/j

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I'm not seeing this according to Autochartist. It's predicying continuation of uptrend. I have removed that pending trade.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
And we're off! I mentioned the 2 yen crosses earlier and the GBPUSD were on my hit list, they triggered when the inside bar broke a couple hours ago.. The EURJPY got stopped out once so Im waiting to see what that does but the GBPJPY and GBPUSD are doing well both up about 70 pips. Is anyone else in these trades?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Yes I'm doing well on G/U &amp; G/Y. My eur/jpy didn't get triggered yet, I've got a sell stop @ 101.550.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
No worries, i don't use autochartist. I like the way you use the other MAs as well as the EMA(50). Good trading.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I take it your EURJPY didnt get triggered and like me your GU and GY got stopped out? Did you move them to break even after they were up a healthy amount of pips? I cant see any more signals on todays charts and with the NFP out today I think it would be risky to take more trades.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
You described that perfectly No trading for me either today, heading out to the golf course.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Actually I got stopped out with a loss on those 2 pairs which was really painful....and then I didnt something really naughty which was to enter the break of the GU GJ inside bars to the long side to get back some of my losses (EEEEK!) counter trade and against this threads rules...ive booked my appointment for traders rehab already. I did make a half of the loss back but i realise this was a reckless thing to do on a friday and when the NFP results are out AND after I said I wouldnt trade a again today.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi all, yeah, not a good week for PTT.. it looks like a lot of retraces now. Could've caught an easy 50 pips or more trading the up move of gj or gu. Oh well, hopefully Monday will open with some gaps in the direction of the trend and PTT will make its pips. I like the comment about 'traders rehab'. Have a good weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I did not see any good inside bar that validated a trade for this week. Did I miss something?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
It may because there is a difference in daily candle stick closes depending on the broker Alpari will give you different bars than Oanda. Also it may be because you have not seen an inside bar come right off the 50ema?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Guys, Im wondering if we modified this strategy slightly so that we keep the 30pip stop loss to cut the losses when its going the wrong way but also have somekind of trailing stop (maybe 50 pips) to lock in some pips when it goes the right way but not the full 200 - 300 pip range... What I can see from back and forward testing inside bar breaks is that it can go a lot of pips in the right direction (when it breaks the inside bar) but as we move our stop loss to the previous day's high (according to the PTT method) IF it does decide to reverse then it means you can't lock in any pips because the stop is so close to your entry point.. Any thoughts? If you have back tested a lot more than I have and think its better to stick to the PTT rules, let me know.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
yes Alseobang, I did have a $41 max floating profit with my trades last week, but ended up losing it by waiting for just the big closeall and by using the PTT jumping stop. I will keep up the PTT stop method, but I do think a TS of 50 or so might work nicely. Maybe u could try it that way and then we can compare results at the end of the month.. ps. I recall that my uchf trade was up 111 pips and then dropped to stop out.. would've been nice to win 61 pips instead.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
It's interesting to read thoughts on how tweaks to Kelvin's ideas might suit individual preferences, afterall this is Kelvin's preferred style and isn't for everyone. In my experience, it's easy to make what we think are small tweaks to a method with strong +ve expectancy to suit our 'style', to then see the method turn sour. Forward testing over at least 100 trades will provide a reasonable set of data to assess the expectancy of the tweaks. Good luck and good trading.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Can't see any trades on the daily chart today. So I stepped down to 4Hr and took a couple of inside bars, to see how the method performs on this TF.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Nothing leaping out at me today although there's some trend continuations I'm thinking about once the 4hr TF line up.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
...i still have a UJ short pending to test any breakdown of the extensive range seen on that chart. Today i've noticed CAD/JPY might trigger a sell from yesterday's IB, so i have a pending order from 74.166 ( Oanda chart). The 7th was a very bearish day prior to yesterday's IB. The setup is within a retracement pattern and not an ideal "coming off the EMA(50)" play, so if it triggers i'll be watching PA closely on the 15min. I don't use Kelvin's exit strat, apart from the intial 30 pip stoploss. Good trading. Edit: SL hit -30. Sell order reset at same level (74.166).

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Very wary of any JPY in case of intervention which could happen if it drops too much IMHO.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi all, I recently found this thread and am really interested in this system. I'm going to try it on my live account (cent account ) soon. I have a question. How long do you keep your pending order that hasn't been triggered? Is there any rule? For example, according to my chart, EUR/JPY had an IB on Oct 5. But a pending order for this IB (short @101.56) hasn't been triggered yet. How long should I keep this order?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Kelvin wasn't very specific about this. He says that if the IB isnt triggered he will cancel the order and review all the possible setups at the beginning of the following week. As that EURJPY inside bar you are refering to is from last week and since then we have retraced up a fair amount I would dismiss that one for now and wait for another IB this week (may even appear today?). Anyone else agree with this?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Fleugel, Welcome to PTT. Yes, I agree with what Alseobang said. In my head, the rule of thumb is that pendings can be open for 1 week. Also, each pair should only have 1 order open for it.. so while I did have an IB for ej on the 5th, I got a new one on the 9th and so I moved the pending order there. I think when price moves so far u should follow it with each new IB. I would stick to the 1 week rule for all. alto

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Thanks Alseobang and alto! Your answers were really helpful. Anyway, this morning, I found an IB on ALL charts I'm checking... I'm checking EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/JPY, USD/CHF and EUR/CHF. Has any of you placed pending orders today?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
yup, modified lots of my pendings. looks like many of the trends have turned after retracing.. hopefully.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, AUD/USD and AUD/JPY got triggered and hit SL. I placed pending orders again for these pairs, but prices are going up further. I'm afraid the trend on larger TF is changing. Anyway, what I love about this system is small SL. Just 30 pips don't hurt me much, especially on a cent account!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hmm, I think because your broker has different closing times for the daily bars yours may look a bit different. My IBs didnt get triggered instead they broke against the main trend and have gone lots of pips the other way....I know I shouldn't say this but it does seem tempting to trade the break of the inside bar either with OR against the trend. Whenever they break they always seem to go a lot of pips in that direction... Is anyone here just trading IB breaks?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Yeah my broker is GMT+3 (FxOpen). I believe Kelvin said earlier in his post that the difference in GMT would cause different trades but they will be leveled out in the long run. So I don't mind SL's I got this time. In the meantime, I got SL with EUR/CHF and placed a buy order again. As for the breakout in the opposite direction, I want to strictly follow Kelvin's rule (EMA50) with this system. I trade manually too, and actually placed buy orders for EUR/USD today. I think there is another system for breakouts, so for PPT, I would like to stay with the set rules. Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Yes, thats right, in the long run it should even out. I definitely think for this thread we should also stick to the rules and see what kinds of results we come up with together. (Its just frustrating when it shoots off after breaking in the wrong direction

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Yes it's tricky at the moment. A lot of pairs seem to be retracing at the moment and it's hard and sometimes quite confusing as to what to do. I agree it does seem to be tempting to place trades to take advantage of the retrace, but I'm sticking to the system for now. I think we are going to have to wait for these pullbacks to resume the main trend.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hello all, Just started to read this thread recently, looks promising. I see nice IBs on EU, GU, UCAD, EJ, AJ, NU, CadJ, GJ, NJ with nice bounce off EMA, and IBs on UC, ECad, EC, and CJ with not so nice bounce. so let's rock and roll and see what we get. (Day is not over yet i know, but it's NY pm, so probably won't change much in next 4 hrs)

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thank you Kelvin....from a newbie

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Tonnes of daily inside bars showing on my Oanda now guys...lets see if they break in the direction of the trend. If they break a million pips in the opposite direction again like they have been doing I'm going to really pi$$ed off! Im so tempted to put limit orders on breaks either side of the IB

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Yeah I found IB on almost all charts again this morning, so moved the entry price for the new IB. As PA has come so close to EMA50 (some have already broken it like AUD/USD), I think it is also highly possible that PA breaks in the opposite direction. It is soooooo tempting! Perhaps it might be a good idea to place orders in both directions when PA is flirting with EMA50. But, to strictly follow Kelvin's rules, I think we should stay away don't we?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I agree, I stayed out of au and some other trades until price starts trending away from ema50.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Is any of you in trade? On my chart, EUR/USD, GBP/USD and EUR/JPY are now triggered. I didn't think those pending orders would be triggered as the price was going to the opposite side of EMA50 but had left them open according to the 7-day rule. (Incidentally, I reduced the number of charts I check to EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY and USD/CHF, i.e. major pairs only, for easier control.) Although I enter trades as Kelvin instructed, I'm going to improve the exit strategy a little bit. I'm thinking of closing 50% at 100 pips, moving SL to breakeven and closing remaining 50% according to Kelvin's rule.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
it is possible to add your own highs and lows to charts to compensate for your brokers timings so you'll see what the others can see

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Several of mine triggered too although I use a slightly different definition for trend. I don't go by which side of the 50 ema price is on (although it does help to recognise trend), I use higher highs lower lows and trend lines for that. The EURUSD and AUDUSD are doing really well at the moment. Hit my stop a couple of times but now im in it up 170pips so far. My entry was on the Sunday candle break. I agree about modifying the exits a bit. I do want to give these as much room to move as possible but I would be gutted if it reversed that much.. Trailing stops are my preferred choice.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi all, It looks like the market overall has turned now. Many pairs are bouncing off the ema50. Hopefully trends will resume and we can catch some good moves. Here's the trades I got for now.. alto

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi Alto, thanks for showing us what you have on. I can't see all of these set ups on the daily candles...are you seeing IBs on the pairs you listed? Or are you taking entries on a different candlestick pattern (like hammers / pin bars?) I use an Alpari and Oanda account which have different daily closes so maybe thats the reason.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I think alto's charts are similar to mine. I'm using Alpari (GMT+2) and FxOpen (GMT+3). My order for EUR/JPY is 105.10 short, almost the same as alto's although I don't understand why EUR/USD is 1.3760 short (mine is 1.3683). Interested to see if this strategy really works regardless of the difference in opening time... Anyway, on my side, USD/CHF and GBP/USD have been triggered. I hope they will bring many many pips "this time"!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hello guys! I've read this entire topic and watched various reactions to trend trading. It's pretty interesting. Well, I'll recommend some books, for those really interested in trendfollowing philosophy: Market Wizards - Jack Schwager The Way of The Turtle - Curtis Faith Trend Following - Michael Covel Trade your Way to Financial Freedom - Van Tharp last book is the best. I usually say that if i could take only one book of trading, would be the Van Tharp's book. Beyond concepts, it is full of practical trading techniques and other recommendations of a more specific to each technique. One hint: don't get extremely focused on the entry method. LONG term trendfollowing (the most profitable, practiced by the great traders of these books) will be right only 20-40% of the time. Are the short losses and long profits (determined by the markets, not by the trader) that make this approach profitable in the long term. Plz, read Tharp's book. I'm certain that you'll learn something that will change the way you see the markets and trading career.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi all, I am on MBT which is probably very different from other brokers, but also I do not trade a pure IB method, or any other candle formation or breakout, etc. It's more of my tech analysis on the D1 chart and when I see a bounce off of the ema.. or some other formation.. like the big triangle right now on uj. I do also use IB lows/highs as entries, but sometimes use the IB from 4-5 candles back as it looks like that's where price turned. Hope that kinda explains why i seem to pick all different entries. so, as u can see, my balance is now at $359, from a start of $400. now, i did take out $40 at the start of this month which would make things about BE so far, but I am getting a little antsy for things to start winning again like it did last month. (actually i don't mind the pace of things as I can learn some patience, but I do want to see the overall profitabilty of PTT as time goes on) I know that a trend following system might have losses or little ups and downs for 11 months in a row, and then win big in month 12 and so end up with a nice annual ROI, but is that really what we can expect with PTT??

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hey all, I just found this on the web and thought it was worth sharing.. http://originalturtletrader.com/originalturtlerules.pdf i think we all heard the great story of the turtle traders and PTT is a method along the same lines so it's a good read. I found the section on exits the most interesting. don't know if I quite agree with giving up 10, 20, even 60%+ gains just to catch that 1 or 2 big 100%+. of course, 100 or 200% ROI sounds really nice, too. I think that the sweet spot that a typical good trend can bring in is about 10%. I have my close all ea set for 20% and usually end up closing trades per kelvin jumping stop method with a 20% wash happening about every 2-3 weeks. although this month has scence neither wash nor winning trend trade. perhaps it would be most profitable to try and catch the 1 or 2 big ones?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hey Alto, thanks for the pdf file. Its a really good read, if not a little bit frightening about the way those guys waited for 1 or 2 trades a year that made their profit....that doesn't sit well with me to be honest. Still, accepting a bunch of losses in a row as part of the norm has done wonders for my stress levels. Trying to be right 60 or 70% of the time before and losing most of the time made me think the the market was attacking me personally. If I can just be right 1 or 2 times out of 10 that gives me huge profits then this has to be the way to go.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
yeah, its a valid way to trade (of course, given the turtle's track record), but I don't think I'm to that level of confidence in my trading yet. I mean, I still miss a trade here and there and what if THAT was the 1 that would've won big, making up for all the little losses. I also meant to comment on what was said in that turtle trading method.. in there, under the part about exits, it talks about letting a 10-30% gain slip by, or letting a 100% gain fall to 60%.. I don't know about that.. in all the results I've seen, any gain of 50%+ is about the highest ANNUAL gain u will see, although there have been some 100+% years. I think that IF I could be patient and lucky enough to see a floating profit of 100%, I would surely close that straight away.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi all Anybody got any trades open ? I haven't seen any for a while now. There are some promising looking pairs.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
yay! uj is finally winning some pips for me! it only took 8 tries so well worth it, right? cuz of the expectancy? Anyway, I agree that there are some good looking pairs right now. It looks like there are several good trends just beginning and I am waiting for a retrace (IB or similar PA) to set my pendings. ok.. c'mon uj!

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Yes I'm in U/J aswell.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
thank u uj for the 15 pips. i put in another stop order just below uj as I think it will drop some more. so not a big gain, but it ends a pretty good losing streak and I'm glad to get back on the winning side. The end of the month is almost here.. doesn't look like a great month for PTT.. nothing like last month. oh well, let's see where things stand at the end of this year.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Anybody got any trades open ?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I was waiting for the announcement. It has come out and a deal has been done. Now we look for trades...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Got a trade in progress on the Aus/Usd +35 pips so far, pending trade on Usd/Cad This is the first PTT trade I've taken where there was a bounce off of the 50ema, in fact multiple bounces, Wonder if that will make the trade stronger ? Half of position taken off for 1:1. Other half running at +90 pips.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
great trades... Olu

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Got a trade open in Usd/Cad now. I did not take the break of the inside daily bar , but waited for price to break through support at 0.9975, which it seems to have done. I'll be taking some of the trade off at 0.9910 because of trendline support. Half the trade closed and stop to BE. Not so confident here, but I've made some nice profit and the rest is a free trade.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Usd/Cad second half was stopped out at BE +5. Second half of Aus/Usd is at + 217 pips. I'm trying a trade management EA and have set a jumping stoploss of 40 pips.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hey guys, today was a fantastic day for this strategy....I think we all tweek the rules a bit here and there and to stick to the fundamentals of this thread I don't want to go in to this too much but I found that instead of putting on a 30pip stop loss I can usually find a swing low on a 15min chart which is around 20 or 30 pips so I prefer to use this as my stop loss. Also, has anyone else been frurstrated with IB breakouts shooting up a hundred pips and then waking up the next day to see that the trade has gone negative? I think its better to hide the stop loss behind a 4 hour swing low. If you think about it, there are only 5 X 4Hour candles in a day, so your stop loss may still be almost the same as if you trailed the previous days low. Just my 2 pips worth... It really does seem though that IBs do tend to shoot off a lot of pips when they break...especially if they break mutiple highs and after testing support areas.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Here's what I got going right now.. go PTT go!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
have you new trades? from today?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
no. nothing new for today. I will take a look tomorrow before market close and see if there are any pendings I should put.. cuz the market often gaps in the direction of a developing trend, so it's good for us PTTers.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I think there will be a few pendings to set up today, after all those big moves yesterday.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
tell us everybody wich pairs, make pending orders!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Just follow the rules from page 1. What I meant was that there is very likely to be inside bars at the close of today, as the bars on quite a few pairs were large yesterday. After that it's up to you to decide which pairs to trade and what direction, not forgetting the weekend and pairs will gap.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
wow. what was with jpy today? Whatever happened, I had a pending above ej and so made some pips there. My uj trade also made a little profit, but I forgot to stick a pending in front of gj so missed out on potential profit there.. oh well. Still 1 more day for this month so let's see how it ends up. I guess we shouldn't track results by month since it's a meaningless measure of PTT's long-term performance, but what else can we do, right? I would be happy with a 1-year or more positive result, but I do think that I would prefer a nice monthly ROI compared to maybe a higher annual ROI, but with higher DD or having mostly losing months. Did that make any sense? For example, I would be more than happy to get something like 2-4% monthly ROI with less than 10% DD, so ending the year at 24-48% (way better than banks or bonds or something like that), compared to getting a much higher 100%+ annual ROI, but with 20%+ DD and many flat or losing months.

Wow ! Woke up this morning to a nice little profit of +200 pips on Aud/Jpy, Don't know what happened, but it was a nice surprise.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi all Eur/Aud has triggered. I've already taken off part of the trade to cover the 30 pip risk and the rest is now at +50 pips stop at BE +10.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hey guys, Oanda is showing a lot of IBs on the yen pairs today..anyone I else looking at these? I didn't see the EURAUD set up, good spot!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
No, I'm not seeing any IB's today. (on Alpari). The Eur/Aud trade hit my BE, but I made +40 pips on it. +240 pips yesterday, not bad for a Monday.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hey all, Well, so far.. not so bad, not so good either.. ended the month with a balance of $358.73. I did take out $40 at the start of the month, so u could say it is approx. even to my start of $400 on 8/29. How bout u guys? what have been your gains since starting PTT? alto

--- 帖子 #454 ---
This system is good but you need to use it with another system to get the best out of it. I use it to get back in a trend when I miss the start of it. It works extremely well with the CICR system.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi All, well, looks like PTT is a good idea, but needs some refinement. I had a decent trade going with a buy on u/chf, but was waiting for the next D1 candle so I could move my stop.. never happened.. price retraced and hit the original SL. I should've put a TS on that one.. oh well, Here's what I think.. PTT is a good start at trend following, but it lacks a good exit method. From what I read on trend following, there is usually a solid move (like a new 10-day high or low) and then the trade continues until a similiar stop signal is given. So the 1-day jumping stop doesn't really work here.. anyone found a good exit method to use?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi all, Amazing thread. I know you trade off daily charts, however i like to trade off 4 hour and 1 hour charts. what size stop loss would you recomend trading your strategy off these charts? Thank you,

--- 帖子 #457 ---
This week has been aweful for this method? Is it just me? I think with all the fundamental news coming out it may be better just to sit back and observe this week.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
well, I would go further and say that all of last month, make that the last 5 weeks, has not been very good for PTT. Finally, i got a good trade and caught eu on the way down.. picked up 116 pips. I did add a 50 pip TS that took me out so we'll see if that was a good thing or should I have waited to move my stop the real PTT way. We'll see. usdeurogold, the original PTT stop is supposed to be 30 pips, regardless of the TF traded. U might experiment with this and find one u like better for H1/H4 trading, but I think this SL works for any trades. alto

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Still pretty quiet. It's all this Eurozone bad news, hopefully It'll calm down soon and the markets can return to some sort of normality. It's hard for PTT at the moment.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I'm in an Aud/Cad trade. Currently up around 30 pips. I took this just as price dipped below the 50ema. Moving very slowly though.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
My Aud/Cad Trade closed out for 50pips. I'm pleased with that. I was trying a new exit method using Steve Hopwoods Multi trade manager with a 40 pip jumping stop. It got me into a 10pip profit when the trade moved to 50 pips, then to the 50pip profit when it hit 90 pips. Sadly retraced then and hit my stop. Kelvins method of trailing with the low of the previous bar would still have me in this trade, so I'll watch to see what happens Over &amp; out (if anyones still following this system) Simmo

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Well done on this trade...I do think the stop was too tight as well for this pair

--- 帖子 #463 ---
EurGbp GbpCad Is tis the same on everyones charts? Olu

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Yes, same on mine. I saw the E/U, but not the G/C as I wasn't watching that pair.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Was up to 50 pips, has now dropped back a bit. I'm at BE. Trade took two days to trigger.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi all, sorry for not posting much lately.. been busy. Anyway, I've been keeping up with PTT and it has been catching more trades recently, but the trends are not as great as they were before and so the winners are not as big as before. Hopefully, the pending trades will pay off big and PTT can end the month with lots of positive pips.. I have noticed more nice price patterns forming on the charts and like to put stop orders in front of price as I believe price will move. Here are a couple nice head&amp;shoulders so I put stop orders just under.. alto

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Can see the usdjpy and the usdchf - both intervention currencies. So I am not taking any of this. Comments? Olu

--- 帖子 #468 ---
yeah, my uj trade got stopped out. I have my stop order far below ema50 for uchf, even though price is moving above ema now.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hmmmm, There has been a bounce of the 50ema on U/Chf so I've placed a buy stop on the IB. There does seem to be some room on the upside, maybe 60-70 pips. I like to close out part of my trade for 30 pips (amount of risk) and let the rest run.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
usdcad audusd cadjpy gbpjpy Olu

--- 帖子 #471 ---
got pending orders on all those, plus aud/jpy.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Even though the system does not use any other indicators other than MA are you bothered that most of these pair are at extremely overbought or oversold. Olu

--- 帖子 #473 ---
I draw my support and resistance, see how much room there is and set the trades. Thats really why I like this system it's a simple idea. Ok, I'll lose 30 pips now and again, but the winners more than make up for those. Also I like to part close for the amount risked then it's a free ride. ( See DIBS thread). I used to try to analyze things like overbought &amp; oversold and just got more confused. How many times do Stochs or whatever you use to indicate overbought or oversold tell you not to buy or sell and the price just keeps on heading in that direction anyway. This system suits the way I like to trade, with the trend, if it turns, then trade with the new trend. I'm still trying to become a profitable trader and this system combined with trading longer timeframes has at least helped me to start moving in that direction. Hope that made sense.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Going well so far

--- 帖子 #475 ---
thanks and well done on the trades

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Is this pair showing an inside bar on your charts? Olu

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Olu, Here's my chart on MBT..

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hasn't moved in the right direction yet.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Now its going the right way

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Yep, up 20 pips Seems to be some support @ 0.8516.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
We'll see about support. I dont mind taking profit there if we get there though Olu

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Yes, I will too. I like to take part of the trade off usually anyway.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Closed out @8530 (+35)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Taken 1/2 off at +34 SL at BE and the other half left to run. Looks like there may be a trade on Cad/Jpy coming up. Bounce off the 50ema. Also Eur/Jpy.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Setup on this pair as well Olu

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi all, Well, it's a new month and so it's time to take an account and see where we are now. It's been 3 months since I started PTT so this is a good time to sorta see how this method is profitable or not. closed balance is $401, i started with $400 on 8/29/11. My max DD (actually max float, but I call it DD, I count open or closed DD) was under 11% during the entire trading so far. I did withdraw $40 after month 1, so I guess we should really add this to ending balance for results. So, an ending balance of $441 on a start of $400 means a $41 gain after 3 months. We can round it off and just call it a 10% ROI in 3 months or a little more than 3% per month. Not too shabby for a pretty simple method that is very doable and based on solid trading ideas. I think I will keep it up and see how another 3 months do for me. alto

gbpusd usdcad nzdusd audjpy gbpjpy chfjpy eurcad nzdjpy gbpcad usddkk How does one pick which one to go with?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi Olu, yup, lotsa IB's. good for moving stop orders close to price. I trade with 9 pairs and almost always have a pending order open on each of them. My thinking is that we never know which pair will take off and give us a good trade, so our job is just to put a stop order in front of where price should move and then hopefully follow that trend if/when it does go.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
took the euro... Olu

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Cant see any in the usual pairs and crosses. Has anyone found any? Olu

--- 帖子 #491 ---
No, none here. My last three trades on PTT have hit the stop.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi all, I just had a bunch of trades trigger and close for a small gain.. let's see, I was at $401, now balance stands at $406.. $5 gain in 15 days is about 1.25% ROI.. nothing to brag about, but a nice little profit. We'll see what the end of the year can do.. Alto

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi all, It's almost 2012 and I just thought I'd do an end of year results for PTT. Well, I should've stopped after the last post, instead I kept on trading and lost a few pips. I ended at about (up a few cents) where I started.. $400. Now I did take out $40 so It the ending balance really should be $440. That's 10% ROI for four months of trading. The worst DD/floating loss I saw was 11%. Intellectually, this is a great result and it would probably make for a nice annual ROI of approx. 30%. A great result provided u have a large trading account and can live off this ROI. I think I will try another way of trading and see if I can find something with a bit better ROI. More important (psychologically as well as realistic.. for my taste) is how PTT often wins only a small % of the time, so u have to endure a string of losing trades before u have 1 or 2 profitable trades. I think I would be happier with 50%+ winners, even if the overall ROI is a little less. Still, PTT was a great success and I learned much by trying it. I will surely keep PTT in mind if the other methods I want to try really bomb. alto

--- 帖子 #494 ---
that's true trend following, guys! Large equity, great need of markets diversification and low win ratio. It's not for all.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi Guys, is anyone using semi-auto robot from Steve Hopwood for PTT trading?

Hi. At what point do you set BE? After what ammount of PIPs?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
i'm here too. just havent posted for a while... Olu

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi, I don't usually move to BE, just leave the initial 30 pip SL until I can start trailing the low/high of the previous bar, as per Kelvins method. I have been trying trailing the stop at a % of the pips, but the jury's still out on that one.

gbpusd - possible long. This one is close to activating usdchf - possible sell usdcad - no signal according to PTT. But candle pattern says sell eurgbp - possible short eurcad - possible short gbpchf - possible short. The gbpchf and the eurgbp trades are kind of inconsistent with risk on trades that is being called for tomorrow Olu

I have been mainly lurking at this thread for a while and just started trading it with real money. I am currently L in AUD/USD too, L in AUD/CAD L in NZD/USD I'd personally would skip that AUS/NZD as to me that doesn't look like it fits the OP rules. but I am looking at a possible GBP/AUD S and a retry of GBP/JPY S (that got stopped out today).

--- 帖子 #530 ---
EurGbp - Short AudNzd - Short gbpcad - long/short xagusd - long

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Where doesn't it fit the rules ? An inside bar following a 50 ema bounce. If anything it should be an add on trade.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
if you read this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...68#post4898168 and you zoom out of AUD/NZD then the trend doesn't seem to clear to me, so imho it should go off the list of potential candidates. EDIT: I am just trying to follow exactly the rules of the OP, not saying possible variations on those can't be as good as well. Good trading !

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Too many to mention. This inside bars was probably created of anticipation/reservation about tomorrow's data out of the US Olu

--- 帖子 #534 ---
yeah, I got 6 candidates all shorts GBP/JPY GBP/AUD EUR/CAD EUR/JPY GBP/CAD USD/CAD

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I've taken off half my Aud/Usd trade for +70 Pips (1st Target), rest is on a free ride. Looks like that was a good call on the Aud/NZD, but I didn't lose just stopped out at BE, (pending trade re-entered). Took the Usd/Cad signal, still waiting for that one. Happy Trading Simmo

--- 帖子 #536 ---
GBP/AUD; GBP/CAD and EUR/CAD have triggered with me, USD/CAD is still open at the moment for me.

+30 pips on G/J. I was trailing the previous bar on the 4hr chart and my stop was hit. (may have to re-think that strategy). Cad/Jpy currently at +100 pips. Had three trades last week allof which hit my 30 pip stop, so today is making that back again

Yes USD/Chf is one to watch. Needs to break support @ 0.9089. Keep an eye on Aud/Nzd for a short. It's not quite a inside bar on my platform, but close enough.

Hi Guys, I've just finished reading through the thread over the past few days and I'm very excited to start trading this method from next week. I'm trying to overcome my fear of losses and this system appears to offer clear rules (aside from determining the trend) which will hopefully help me to just follow a process without letting my emotions takeover. @ Olu &amp; Simmo24 - I've notice that you both have kept with this system for sometime. You've obviously been profitable. Would you mind sharing some of your results over the last few months? My broker is GMT +2, just wondering whether my daily bars will be the same. What GMT time are others watching? Looking forward to testing this out.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
still reading....very exciting method

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi All Been away for a while. I've been a bit busy with the day job . Also I've started to trade this system live and it's immediately gone quiet. Seems to be a lot of pairs in consolidation at the moment. I have had a couple of live trades which I made a small profit on, but closed to early (it's tougher leaving them alone trading live), but I'm sure I'll improve. I'll try to post some live trades, but I'm being a lot more selective now

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I know how the day job can affect things. It is important though even though I look to break free from it soon. It ha supported my lifestyle and family till now. Olu

just a quick question for the pending order what if it doesnt trigger on the next candle but made new high or low do we cancel the order? for eg a pending long, the next candle made a lower low do we cancel the buy order?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Have a look at Kelvinm's explanation in the first few posts, he can explain it far better than I. Essentially either your trades run in the right direction or they will hit your 30 pip SL, if it hits your stop reset it. Simmo

--- 帖子 #562 ---
hmm AUD/USD seems like a short anyone in there?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
but didnt take it because of the fundamental data coming out... Olu

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Up 40 pips so far. This was the only signal I had today.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Some resistance here on Eur/Gbp. I'm still in it though, also in Aud/jpy.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Took a profit from Eur/gbp of +50 pips and am waiting for add on trade to trigger. Took a 35 pip profit from Aud/Jpy as that was bouncing off major resistance. I've got a pending buy on GBp/jpy targeting 132.60.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Kelvin, Can you explain the re-enter price. "We re-enter the buy stop at the same price." Is that the price that the initial position was taken or is it the stop out price (initial price - 30pips) Thanks eRelation

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Pretty sure he means the initial position. We haven't seen Kelvin in this thread for a long time. Simmo

--- 帖子 #569 ---
It is strange, that author of thise thread is absent here... Also this strategy very interesting and has much potential.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi all, I'm back to do some more trend following. I stopped for a bit to try another PTT-like trading using a few indies as signals, but it didn't turn out so good for me. I should've just been happy with the success I got with PTT and not fooled around with other things, but u know.. the grass always looks greener on the other side and all that. so anyway, here I go for round 2 and hopefully this can last.. I was reading through the thread again and really liked how simmo added some colorful MA lines.. just having the 50 ema makes things look somewhat lonely and hard to read the PA at times.. now I can see a bounce much easier. ok, good trading all

--- 帖子 #571 ---
ok, I got pending orders on for 7 pairs now.. the 4 majors, ucad, a/u, e/j so far took 2 -30 sl's, wonder what my first winner will be? I was taking a look at my closed trades to see what pairs are most profitable/not profitable.. seems that ej is the big winner and gu is the worst. however, that could just be due to the season/market and let's see if those results change over time.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
update:

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hi all, Slow going, but looks like the pairs I'm trading are turning my way now. Hopefully next week will have some winners..

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi all, well, finally got some trading going on. So far my record is 4/9 (trades won/total trades completed) and the balance is slowly increasing.. up to $499.46 from a start of $494.29.. a little better than 1% ROI in less than a month. I adjusted the entry of the original PTT from just using inside bars to using recent S/R levels or S/R that looks good to me. I haven't had any add-on trades yet, but would enter those on inside bars if they show up. Here are the pendings I got now..

--- 帖子 #575 ---
So it looks like my ptt is chuggin along.. up to $507 (from $495 start) which is a little better than 2% gain in just over a month. 1-2% monthly ROI is right on track for my expectations. I plan on increasing my lotsizing as soon as I feel the time is right. I consider ptt to have cycles where it takes several (many) little losses and then catches 1-a few good moves and make up for all the losses and makes overall profit. This time around it only took 1 good move on euro to win big, but there's still some open trades that are looking good, too.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi Alto Nice to see PTT has some followers still. I've been leaving trading alone for a few weeks, but I'm back now with PTT, I really think it has potential, but with the eurozone crisis I don't think tradings been easy lately.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
hello simmo, good to have u back trading ptt. I didn't think anyone but me was lookin at this thread anymore. yeah, ptt is a good system and the only one i've tried that makes positive ROI. I knew deep down that catching trends is one of the only true ways a trader can succeed, but I was always drawn away to fancier, flashier stuff, u know? Now I am quit satisfied with ptt. alto

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hello, I just found this thread last week and decided to go live after doing some backtesting. Had one loser on EURUSD yesterday and today it's +44 at the moment...tempted to move my stop to b/e but I'll try to stick to the rules...really stressed about leaving it open over the weekend though, could end up losing more than 30 pips if it gaps up. I don't know if I should ask this or not but has anyone tried taking all inside bars regardless of trend direction? On backtesting it seems just as profitable as going with the trend...but I could be wrong. Shannon

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi shannon, welcome to PTT. I'm no expert on this as I've only been trading PTT for several months, but trades always seem to go in our favor over the weekend. That is, other traders also see the trend and all their orders seem to help push price in the trend's direction. At least that's how it always has been for me in my past trades. As far as all the Inside bar trades.. do u mean to trade both sides of an IB, regardless of trend? U could papertrade that strategy and see how it works out. I know there was one guy on this thread who did trades off every IB and in both directions, he did ok for some time, but no longer posts and I can only assume that means it was a losing strategy overall.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi all, not the best example (or maybe it is since its not too good or bad), but here u can see how my trades did ok as all my order were carried over to the weekend. In fact, I has no open trades at close on fri., just pendings. then two got triggered when market opened. It looks like u/j is about to trigger, too. ok, just wanted to show how PTT does well with weekend trading.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Well my EURUSD trade did well last weekend and closed with +75 pips, now I'm up about 125 pips on NZDUSD...but I've also had quite a few losers so at the moment I'm just breaking even...waiting for a big winner. Anyway I had another question...if you have a winning trade and then the price pulls back into the range of the IB do you keep trading it or do you sit back and wait for another IB to form?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Shannon, First off, wanted to share that my record so far in my PTT trading this time around is 19/41 (winners out of total completed trades).. less than 50%. My point is that PTT has a favorable expectancy so a few wins will more that make up for a bunch of losers. I actually use a trail of 40 pips, so I'm sure that doing so messes with the ratio compared to trading true PTT style. I like the almost 50% win:loss so don't mind giving up some pips. PTT should yield a nice 10:1 win ration(in pips), but that also comes with a much lower trade win:loss. As for your second question.. according to Kelvin's original PTT rules, once a pending order is triggered a trade, that's it for that pair UNTIL a new IB forms. To me it's about exposure, too. U don't want to throw all your margin into any 1 trade, and we're not eager to make trades. If a trade is going good and then dips back into a IB zone, just wait for the trade to start moving in the right way again.. that is unless u have reason to believe the trend.. etc. it's up to your trading style..

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hello All (Alto &amp; Shannon), I've been a lurker on these forums for quite some time and don't ever really chime in but liked this thread so much I decided to jump in. I am a big advocate of trend following after going through many different strategies and losing most of my trading career if you could call it that. I lost about 80% of my account equity before TF and then made it all back with very little stress. I trade a strategy very similar to this but on a weekly and monthly time frame. It is is very slow and boring; not sexy, not hip. But trading should be like a business and TF strategies like this (systematic and mechanical) are designed to profit in the long run. I don't believe there is one "true" method of trading that everyone must follow in order to make money. What works for some might not work for someone else. TF works for me and I feel comfortable with it. Some of the greatest traders you never hear of are trend followers. Think Jesse Livermore of "Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator" and John W. Henry who now owns the Boston Red Sox. Anyways, I adopted the inside bar entry method for my trading and will be following and chiming in here and there. Too bad Kelvin doesn't chime in anymore, he had such good grammar and a good way of explaining. Good luck and happy pipping! Slik

Slik, Thanks for your post. I like testimony like that. Yeah, PTT sure is being pretty slow and boring right now.. It usually takes 2-3 week before u can catch a good move that pushes the balance up overall. I am having a good run with usdcad right now and it even better bcuz I have my very first add-on trade going. We'll see if it can make up for the slew of small losers recently. alto

Alto, This is my very first post. I looked thru this thread on the past few days. I like what I see. Tell me how you have done up to date following this strategy. I just put in 4 orders and will follow this strategy on my demo account. I will keep you posted.

Hello blazer, welcome! good to have more ppl on this good thread. well, right now I am in some DD, but I try not to worry about that and just look at results when my balance increases. I can tell u that ptt is not flashy or high profit/trades per second kind of trading.. ie. i got 1 open trade right now (usdcad sell). I think ptt takes some patience to trade and there are times when the winning trades do come faster, but mostly it's lots of small losses and just 1-2 winners. good luck to u and do demo until u feel comfortable with this. alto

Hi all, I know this thread is all but dead, but I'm still trading PTT and I still think it is a good, stable, and very very slow method. I wanted to get 100 closed trades in so I could report some real resuts. I had 52 wins out of 100 trades.. actually, this is a surprise since I only expected around 30% wins. I also only trade 7 pairs (eu,gu,uj, uchf, au, ucad, ej) so if more pairs were traded, it might not take so long to reach 100 trades. I'm trading D1 TF so maybe that could also be lowered? Anyway, I only traded 1 micro lot at a time and with that I had 2.04% max DD. I will consider increasing my lotsize since this is just a fun account and I think PTT could handle some more risk. Oh, and probably most important is that after all the wins and losses, I pulled out $70 profit (had about $90, but want to leave some in) from my $400 start.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Yes unfortunately there are many dead threads with actually georgous systems - mostly D1, which most consider too slow for getting rich quickly. What was your max trade size (1 microlot) as a percentage of your capital? Thanks for the update

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Thanks for providing the statistics. Few more clarifications, if you don't mind; When did you start and how long it took to get 100 trades? Did you add on to winning positions? By micro lot you mean 10cents / pip? Did you trail on daily low as Kelvin outlined? Thanks in advance TS

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Wow.. 2 responses already.. that's hyper activity for this thread! ok, let me answer the Q's.. @ Forex37, I used a SL of 30 pips for all my trades, the amount varies a little depending on the pair, but always about $3 and less than 1% risk per trade. The most open trades was 5 and it was usually only 1 or 2. @ TradeStar, I started trading on 6/3/2012. The plan was to add-on, but I only actually did that once. I think this is due to me NOT following the daily low trail as laid out by Kelvin, instead I used a EA to manage my TS and TP.. I used a TS of 40 (not exactly a lot of room to run) cuz I wanted to quicker, consistent trades. I also had a global equity TP set at $50, but that only hit once.

Is it June 3rd or March 6th? Thanks TS

--- 帖子 #592 ---
June 3 I forgot to say.. with this method it is slow going for a long time, with no real activity or a number of small losers, and then, after a few months, u catch a real good run that makes all the profit.. In all my 100 trades, i had only 3 times when the account made a new high balance (I mean, a significant high, not just $1-2).. so it's many little steps back and a few big steps forward. update: I just went over my account history and figured out that I forgot to add in the fee's and commish that I paid for my trades (I use mbt and there are alot of little fee's, and it adds up) anyway, it came to $12 in commish and they did some other adjust stuff that I don't understand. So the new real world profit I got is $58 on my $400 opening balance. That comes to 14% ROI. Now that I have more faith in the method I can increase the lotsize per trade and the max DD should still remain very low. Still a annual ROI of 20% is the goal for me so PTT is working out.

Hi all, Looks like I picked a good time to increase my lotsize. (doubled it) uj has been on a good run and I caught 164 pips of it yesterday. gu also had a small win. End result is I'm up $40, which is a good gain on my small account. There is also some open trades in profit now.. always nice to have free trades going. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Alto - good to hear that you are having success with this method. With the 14% ROI you achieved during the 6 months since you started, what currency pairs were you trading?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
.Actually I just now see that you mentioned above that you traded this on 7 different pairs. Good job on this, Alto!!

--- 帖子 #596 ---
outside bars are far more profitable than inside bars for these kind of trades... entries near the ma after a retrace is best... 2 or 3 retrace bars the same colour then a change is also a good signal

Hi Kelvin, thank for your system! Is a trading bomb! I have only a question, in the JPY crosses how much is the stop?? 30 pips like the other? I made this question because 1 pip for usd/jpy or eur/jpy is the secon figure after the comma. Thank in advance

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Any one trade this system at this time?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hi BlackShark, Yes, I am trading this in Forex, and it is working well...but then again, the markets have been trending the past few months. I am also looking at trading this in the US Options market, as there are more assets to trade, and as long as one is buying puts, and buying calls, then they dont need a Stop Loss at all, believe it or not. Only thing though, is that Options have expiration and time decay, so I am not sure it will work in that market, but I am experimenting with it there. I would have to say that it works during trending markets, but not so much during ranging markets (especially during US summer months).

--- 帖子 #600 ---
You use a fixed stoploss of 30 pip even on x/jpy crosses?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
No, I am not trading jpy crosses yet...just EURUSD and AUSUSD.

Hi everyone, I’ve been reading this thread for a few days now and I’m very happy to see that you are actively trading with this strategy as I like KevinM’s philosophy and methodology. I’m hoping to go live with this soon but I have a question; because I would like to re-enter the order if my initial stop loss is hit, as soon as possible, does anyone know of an EA or way to set-up MP4 to alert me on my android? My apologies if the questions already been asked and answered. Dave.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
You can usually set up an alert in your platform, so that when a trade closes, you will get an alert...I have it set up so that my broker sends a text message to my cell phone.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks - I will give them a call.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Exactly, is the method that I use.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Just spoke to my Broker - Alpari uk and they don't have anything like this available. Any advice ? (i.e. find a more helpful broker) lol

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi Dave, You are correct. Alpari UK provides an execution-only service. However, there may be a number of tools available on the MQL4 community which might make this easier. Alex ________ Alexander Chadwick Alpari (UK) Representative

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Thank you Alex, I'll have a look. and my apologies - its not the job of the broker to fill in my learning curve/frustration. Dave.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hello, i'm going to consider my time testing this strategy this week i will do a lot of backtest because it looks really nice, furthermore you don't need to stay in front of the computer the whole day

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi All, Nice to see the thread still alive. I've started trading PTT again.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
AUD/NZD

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Let's respark interest in this thread! @simmo24 are you still trading PTT?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hi panguFX, I'm looking at this again. Using a weekly TF as a trend direction - I'm going to eyeball if that suits me better than a 50 ema.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
