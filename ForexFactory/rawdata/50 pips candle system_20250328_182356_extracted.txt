High everybody ! For this system, you need 2 indicators : a pen and some paper. I trade only GBP/USD because usually, there are big movements. Each time the price move 50 pips up, i draw a green candle. Each time the price move 50 pips down, i draw a red candle. As Renko, this system does not take care about time, a candle is drawn when 50 pips are done whatever the time to reach it. This is good to eliminate the noise. This system is good in trend and in range.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
So, here is november 2009 :

--- 帖子 #3 ---
The rules : I buy when the 2 previous candles are green. I sell when the 2 previous candles are red. (playing the trend) I consider we are in a range when 3 reverse candles are coming. Then i continue to play with the range when the 3 previous candles are reverse. TP = 50 pips SL= 50 pips

--- 帖子 #4 ---
A= buy V = sell + = 50 pips - = - 50 pips Now we have 150 pips in November. Let see it next weeks.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
time frame?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Usually i use TF 30 min. But when there are news, i need sometimes to use 1 min because one or two 50 pips movement may be hide in a 30 min candle. But TF is not very important, just to draw the candle correctly.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
is there not 2 winners and one losser in november ? have you back test it or looked at it in other mounth how does it look ? it looks more profitable if you take a long positions after a red candle and a short position after a green candle best regards

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hello Would it not be more LOGICAL if you were to trade against the previous closing candle. For example, when green candle is drawn, open sell for next order. If red candle is drawn, open buy for next order. It makes easily 600 pips as opposed to 150 pips. Also, lets not forget the spread... we can look at this later. LOGICAL

--- 帖子 #9 ---
What timeframe do you use?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
it isn't tf based. It is movement based. My question is when do u start your count? Everyone would have diff trade depending on when u started counting up or down. I guess good starting point would b week opening. But if u start just 1 min later u would take different trades as the person who started exactly at market open

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Has anybody came across an indicator that highlights 50 pip movement on a chart? This will save lots of time rather than manually checking each move. With regards to timeframe - there is none - this system is pip based not time based. With regards to results - yes everyones will be different depending on open time/price of initial trade. With regards to this system - I think it can be a good system because just say that 50% of the time price is in a trend and 50% of the time price is is a range we can catch pips both times. Even set a trailing stop at 50 pips so that we can catch bigger pips in a trend. Also when price is in a trend, there is small ranges in the middle of trend. Good way to get that 50% up even more and catch pips. LOGICAL

--- 帖子 #12 ---
In novembre we have 12 winners (12+) and 9 loser (9-) I backtest The system and the result is august =500 pips, September = 850 pips, october = 750 pips your suggestion is good for range period, but not if we are in a trend...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
This week, we had ranges, but when the trend will come back, your suggestion will fail...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You can start when you want : you draw the 2 or 3 previous candles and you put your order...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
what about if we dont use 50 pips as a target and stopploss for the candle mark we use maybe 20 pips that way we can have more money in the market ? best regards

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Couldnt a 50 pip box be used, and let charting software develop the point &amp; figure chart? Am I missing something here?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I like 50 pips because there are less candles to draw ! There are less false signal, and it shows the real trend. And with 50 pips, it is not necessary for me to stay all day on the computer...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
aaaaa had hoped you should have an answear for that now i must try it myslef, my resoning here is that if i can have smaller stopps i can have more money in the market and by that make more money. I dont see why you should not be able to stay as long as you will in front of the cpomputer regardless how many pips the candles are made of ? How many loser have you maximum have in a row have you had an losing munth that you have seen? best regards

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I think 20 pips will give us to much false signals : 2 candles up and 2 candles down, not good for the system. 50 pips candle eliminate the noise. I can't stay all day with the computer, lots of things else to do in my life... So with 50 pips candles, i can put orders and go for something else. I check the market every 2-3 hours. Since august, i had 4 consecutive loss max.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
you mean you think i win most at the end of the mounth if i use 50 pips candle instead of 20 ? do you think 50is the most optimal or perhaps 100 ? best regards

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yes i think 50 pips is the good size for GBP/USD. But you can backtest with 20 or 100, it's easy but long

--- 帖子 #22 ---
If you put Sweet Spot Gold indicatr on chart with main set to 100 and sub set to 50 you can see the 50 pip increments without counting. ( add "0" for five digit accounts.)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
it shows every 50 pips or 100 im not sure it will be correkt it dont start the count correct i think ? best regards

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Let's see what happened today, we have 5 more candles :

--- 帖子 #25 ---
These 5 candles give us 50 pips more, so we have 200 pips for november

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Please keep us posted; this is a very simple system, let us know how it goes. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
How are you getting this Green-red image.. DO you have any indi or is it manual..

--- 帖子 #28 ---
It is manual

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Zebulon thanks for the share. I have a question Candle 7 why did you take the Long trade. The previous two weren't green. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Because we are in a range, not a trend : the 3 previous candles are red, green, red, so i play green

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Okay, thanks

--- 帖子 #32 ---
this night, we had 2 more candles and 50 pips more total 250 pips for november

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Zebulon, Interesting indeed. So to clarify, you don't care if the candle has long wick right. As long as in that 30 min it has move 50 pips then you count it? Also, if the candle that move more than 50 pips, say 110 pips in 30 min do you count that as 2 or still just 1.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
i canot understand the range and the trends....... When or what the range is, i mean when to use this method...... Can u explain to me by an attachment when to use it and when not....

--- 帖子 #35 ---
bro can you draft for me GbpJpy can use this method also? or need adjust the tp and sl?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
i canot understand the range and the trends....... When or what the range is, i mean when to use this method...... Can u explain to me by an attachment when to use it and when not....

--- 帖子 #37 ---
A candle is drawn if the next 50 pips line is touched. I don't care about wicks if they don't touch the 50 pips line above or under. If the price move from 1,6600 until 1,6710, i draw 2 green candles...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Sorry for my english, is not vrey good. For me a range is a row (maybe it is the good word) So when the 2 previous candles are green we are in a trend, i buy. When the 2 previous candles are red we are in a trend , i sell. When we have 1 red, 1, green, 1 red, we are in a row, i buy When we have 1 green, 1 red, 1 green, we are in a row, i sell.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I didn't try it on GBP/JPY. Maybe it works. But we need big movements or adjust de tp or sl (you're right)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I'd like to see some testing of this, I think OP was too quick to dismiss it.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
is there an ea for this ?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Ok thanks very much bro i will try on the demo and will reply the results.......again thanks and good luck.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
thx bro for the reply. Is there any latest chart for GU or GJ you draw? So that i can follow your chart draw at my screen

--- 帖子 #44 ---
An EA would be very easy to do, but I don´t know mq4 language. But it is quite and simple. What I am doing is just to draw lines in 50 pips range where the price is, and puting sell or buy orders depending of what could happend. Take a look

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I put together a quick MT4 indicator which will draw the 50 pip candles on a chart. There is a single parameter, CandleSize, which defines the movement size in pips for each "candle," defaulted to 50 pips. It uses the week's opening bar as the initial price. For the week's opening candle, it uses the first candle at 12:00am Monday. For FXDD, this is the first candle of a given week, but you may need to adjust it per your broker's time zone. http://imgur.com/yYdOn.png

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Sorry i have nothing yet for GJ

--- 帖子 #47 ---
3 more candles but no change : 250 pips for november

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thank you for the indicator, I will try to create an expert. I will let you know.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you for your contribution and your work, i 'm happy that an ea could help us soon

--- 帖子 #50 ---
if you take a look, you can see I´ve got diferent 50 range candles as you

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi, i tried ur indicator but mine looks different from yours. I am using IBFX. Thanks... please see attached.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Put it in 15M timeframe, I had the same problem. *Counting the orders from 1th november, I´ve got 15 won and 15 losses... I think where you start counting does affetc the results

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Zebulon, how and where do you draw your candles to look like yours?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
how can i draw the 50 pip chrat in the mt4 can u help me ??????

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I have started this month at 1,6350 and this week, my first candle was from 1,6650 to 1,6700. All the candles start at a price which is multiple of 50 (round prices = big levels). To draw the candles, the TF may be important : if TF = 30 min or 15 min, you can have several 50 pips movements up and down in 1 candle that you can't see (especially during the news). My next order is always placed, so it is activated if the price is touched. Sometimes during the news, i change the TF to 1 min to see all the movements.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Shall it really come down to what starting point he started at then the system dont work it is just luck. best regards

--- 帖子 #57 ---

--- 帖子 #61 ---
any one can help me how to trade the 50 pips using any platform that i can draw the 50 pip charts...... it looks a great method to trade with but i need to know how to draw the 50 pip chrat. good luck....

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Here's an indicator that can be set to a 50 pip spacing.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Zebulon, trust me, it depends where you start counting... This month 0 pips and last month +250 pips... Those results differs so much of yours...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
how can i use this ....? how to update it ?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I think the best price to enter is round number because round number = big levels.: 1,6600 1,6550 etc...

--- 帖子 #66 ---
You can't believe it but it's true, i take a pen and when the price is going from 1,6600 to 1,6650 i draw a candle.. So simple

--- 帖子 #67 ---
can u help me plz how to draw the 50 pip charts

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I have little modified the indicator posted here by marc.newlin PriceActionTrend so now it doesn't reinit on week open and plots right when TF is changed. The difficult of this system is when to start it... Lubo. P.s I set the indicator to 500 pips for 5 digit Brokers.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
novembre updated. total = 250 pips

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello How are you trading in sleeping time? price can change 100 and more pips?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I place orders in advance. But sometimes i miss some movements...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Why don't you use Renko charts if you just want to see 50 pip moves?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Because with renko, you need 100 pips down to have a candle. So you can't see the range (the row) with it. If the price goes from 1,6550 to 1,6600 and from 1,6600 to 1,6550 and again from 1,6550 to 1,660, you won't see it with renko...

--- 帖子 #74 ---
So if you made the size of your blocks 25 wouldn't it do the same thing?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Maybe, i don't know renko very well. My system is easy and good for me

--- 帖子 #76 ---
This is true renko is different coz is a reverse like chart. If u use 25 pips renko u have the trend bar every 25 pips and reverse every 50 pips, maybe little confused to follow with zebuleon strategy. This is 50 and 25 pips renko charts.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Zebulon, Do you have your results for Oct, Sep, and Aug??? If so can see them? Thanks for sharing your strategy.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
hi man how r u i would be pleased if u can tell me how to use the renko ???? its my first time that i have heard about it ..... it look great ...i need a method to draw the 25 or teh 50 pips so if the renko can be a good way to use i will be very happy if u will help me with that..... thanks and good luck.....

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Sorry for my English. Interested in this tactic and made this simple indicator. It should be applied to the chart Renko box size equal to 25 pips, if you want to get a candle of 50 pips. http://s16.radikal.ru/i190/0911/2d/ef0e09294342t.jpg

--- 帖子 #80 ---
This is looking really really promising. Now if we can think up a way to have it automate so we don't stare all day at the screen we may have a winner. See attached. The issue is whether the indicator "pricechangechart" catches the 50pips as soon as it happens or at the bar close. If it catches it at the point (50 pips) we can take the 50-spread for profit. If at bar close, then go for the distance. Can anyone do this. JMS

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi, what kinda of renko for MT4 do u use, can u post it here? U made also an EA for this strategy? Thanks. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
november updated. total = 250 pips waiting for a big row or a big rally

--- 帖子 #83 ---
i have no charts to show you but my results are : august = 450 pips september = 900 pips october = 750 pips

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi everyone, I've followed this forum for a while and today i decided to become a member. Thanks for all your posts. @Zebulon : Could you please clarify this I start counting at 6AM on H1 chart. 1. At 7AM i have a green candle 2. At let say 9:05 i have one more green candle --&gt; I buy immediately at that price 3. At 2PM i have red candle ---&gt; wait for another red or green candle to form a signal 4. From 2PM until a red/green candles formed i do not take any action. Is it correct? Thanks Keith P.S : Do you start counting the pips at the open of a candle or anywhere (50 pips away from the open price of each candle)?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Zeublon do you have results for previous months also? I have started backtesting from jan 2009 - time consuming but looks promising!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
LOGICAL experiment what would happen if you have started different periods please ? best regards

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Your example : 1. i have a green candle from 1,6600 to 1,6650. When the second candle is beginning, i place a buy order at 1,6700. 3. i have 2 green and 1 red from 1,6700 to 1,6650 : i place a sell order at 1,6700 (to play the row) and i place a sell order at 1,6600 (to play the down trend)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
No i don't, but very interrested to know your results. It is difficult to backtest because sometimes, there are big movements (news) you can't see with 1H or 30 min TF...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hi every one here what i have reached to .... we can draw the 50 pips charts in the meta 4 by setting the lines with 50 pips distance ......so here the attchment ... good luck.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
now i will try the 50 pip method and i will reply later the results that i will reach to...... i will try the 50 pips strategey on the demo for one week and the next week i will post the results..... have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
yes,if you're little lazy you can use a indi,it calls sweet spots...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Interesting lazy method lol You could start your count from the daily opening. So, if the first 50 pips of the new day moves in the same direction as the 50 pips leading up to the new day, you place an entry after the first 50 pips of the day. If you make sure your new day starts from the Asian open you could factor in the average daily range of a currency pair and cut your profits or not enter when the ATR has been met which will probably smoothen the equity curve.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi I was trying to match the image posted on post 82. My candles matched exactly as in the image EXCEPT... In the attached screenshot, the 2 candles with arrows does NOT shows with my data. The tabular data shown below - 2 candles in RED text are extra on your chart..(i think) 6550 R 6600 G 6550 R Nov 6, 19.55 GMT 6600 G 6550 6600 Nov 08 23.000 GMT 6650 G 6700 G 6750 G I would appreciate if you can check that as that makes the diff in the Nov pips.. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #94 ---
The data was not pasted in tabular format in the previous post.. So trying again..if I am lucky 6550 R 6600 G 6550 R 6600 G Nov 6, 19.55 GMT - OK TILL HERE 6550 6600 6650 G Nov 08 23.000 GMT - OK from HERE 6700 G 6750 G

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I remember, it was november 5th, it was the official bank rate in GB. If your TF is 1 h or 30 min, you won't see these two candles. Have a look with 1 min TF. I was on my screen at this moment. And the price went up and down in several seconds..

--- 帖子 #96 ---
..hmm.. thanks for the reply however this was on friday evening almost at the close of day.. So when it opened on Sunday evening.. it opened at a higher rate.. is it a broker to broker issue.. Like for me both on Alpari UK and Forex.com ..It ended the week at 1.6607 and opened sunday at 1.6657. (A BIG JUMP) Is it different with your broker..

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Okay I started backtesting from 5 JAN 2009 on FXDD MT4 DEMO. This is a very looooong process so please forgive me if there is any trades that aint precise. I placed sweet spot gold indicator with settings changed to 'linestylemain 100' and 'sublevels 50' These results so far are until 16 FEB 2009. A = BUY V = SELL O GREEN = 5O PIPS UP O RED = 50 PIPS DOWN Y = +50 PIPS X = -50 PIPS 5 JAN - 2 FEB = +3500 PIPS 2 FEB - 16 FEB = -600 PIPS Please open excel sheet and start from sheet1 and then sheet2. Regards LOGICAL

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thank you Zebulon for this interesting thread. One question. Do you always use round numbers for your entries, stops, and targets?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Are you starting counting 50 pips on Big Levels? I mean, X.XX00´s and X.XX50´s ?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Yes counting on big levels .00 and .50

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Logical Thank you for your hard work Let see if it´s profitable or not!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Okay I am gonna call it a night just now. Results so far..... JAN: +3500 FEB: -600 MAR: +400 APR: -550 LOGICAL

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi, Very nice work, but did you sleep in thi 4 moths since it seems your trades are counted 24/5. If you do not have EA or you switch shifts with your wife no way to trade like this. If you have alarm set sometimes it would wake you up several times during the night. If you just place buy/sell orders then it is a grid system because you do not know if you will have 2,3,4 green/read swichis in the row. I was looking myself 24/5 for period of 01.09.-16.10.2009. and had 184 trades in total and 106 winers ans 78 lossers. it is 1400 pips in 1,5 moths. Nice pips but you have to trede it 24/5 and this is not including spread. So we need EA or you will see your wife twice a day for 30 seconds. Maybe only this aspect of the system is good enough :-) Sasa

--- 帖子 #104 ---
So far on 24/5 trading 53 trades, 33 win 20 loss. 650 pips. Sasa

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Yes, always round numbers

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thank you very much for your work !!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
We know (thanks logical) few month could be negative. We know (thanks sasa) we can't trade on 24/5. I trade with this system and i have a work, a wife, children and lots of things to do. I dont trade 24/24 of course, i place orders in advance. Sometimes i miss some movements. Maybe it is better to trade only during day when movements are bigger. I wanted to find a system wich is profitable and simple. Now it is up to us to update it and make it easier to run and more profitable...All ideas are wellcome.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
This seems a good system but it has 2 points which should be addressed in order to make it more profitable. First, 50 fixed pips are not a healthy target and candle measurement. At the beginning of this year 50 pips were simply noise and I think this is the reason why one month was highly profitable and the next a losing one. You have to find a way to measure the average movement and then establish a target. Second, the entry is late at the party.The market moves first 2 x 50 pips and then must move another 50 without retracement in order to profit. Any movement which is smaller than 150 pips will be a loss. I'll make some backtesting because the idea is interesting.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I completely agree with Sauron. I think this strategy has potential, but need to be defined... I think we need some indicator to filter bad entries, or to comfirm good ones... But the potential of riding on a big trending or ranging market is very interesting... On the other hand, what I dislike of this strategy is the diversity of the results, you can see that someone has in november 650 pips and others 250... and so... And because of this, it makes me wonder, if it is only luck, or something like that... Of course, the best here is to do an EA, let´s see if any coder in FF want to help us, just to backtest more easily and quickly... Good trading to all, and keep this post alive!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Heya Interresting concept indeed .. i guess we will see soon some more personal ploted charts .. they deffenetly give views from a different perspective .. be creative fellas.. i think this system could be usefull for binary forex traders .. aswell i will give it a shot... thnx for sharing cheerz

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Could you modify the indicator to start the first 50-pip candle from a round number 00 or 50 preferably starting from the first round number after the weekly open; this way the 50-candles will always coincide with the sweet spots throughout the week.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
A good start price will be the weekly open. In this case everybody would look at the same chart, day after day. My 2 cents: Century marks, as 1.6700 currently for cable, have no meaning. Also, if you decide to use some volatility based average instead of 50 pips always, you'll not see this marks too often.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
The problem with the week open as the start point of 50-candles is that every broker has a different opening price for the week, but if we start from the first round number after the week open then everybody will be on the same boat during the week.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
ok, we'll let zebulon to set the most significant round price after the weekly open. Anyway, the chart will vary becase some broker will quote a price which goes over the 50 pips mark and others will stop at 48 pips and then reverse.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
That's why i chose round numbers and i started the month at 1,6350. I was thinking everybody will have same charts and same results. But the price is not the same for all brokers as Sauron said...

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Another idea, often in a uptrend, we are stopped because the price goes back 50 pips down (consolidation, retracement) and goes up higher. The result will be better if we take : for the trend : TP = 50 SL = 100 for the range : TP = 50 SL = 50 it seems for novembre we would have 350 pips instead of 200. I will backtest this

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Or you could use the jacksons &gt;anti hedge&lt; where u could keep a SL of 50 and as it gets triggered .. and then retraces back in your direction ,re enter at your SL point... just an idea..

--- 帖子 #118 ---
You see? Now the thing is getting very interesting... Ideas everywhere... Good job boys!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
This is, is not perfect but I think is enough reliable, coz I'm not a real programmer but a little tweaker, Lubo.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
400 pips counting on big levels 00´s and 50´s by now... thanks for the indi, the problem is that when I go months back, the indi get a lil crazy painting anywhere!... Any ideas to fix that?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
FORGET IT ! not good for other months

--- 帖子 #122 ---
The indi is nice but it paints from the begining od the week. round numbers should be beter, so the fist candle shoud start at firs round number of the week. and it would be nice if you can make it work on 25 pip moves. I get 30 pips when I set it to 25. Sasa

--- 帖子 #123 ---
i have working on this one week and i have seen that if we take all the time 50 pip , dont matter when to start ..... work also only with 30 min tf.....it looks graet way and in the end of this week i well post my results... tp 35 st 50 i think its the best way to work with......

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I have to correct myself the indy is not reliable, I don't know why... I have find here on FF a script for renko chart, may if some programmer would like could modified it to plots like the zebuleon chart. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
It is a script? It does not work on my charts. Sasa

--- 帖子 #126 ---
You have to save it on script folder, run it and open m2 offline chart. Lubo.

logical do you think it matters where we start counting in the long run ? or can we start count anywhere ? best regards

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Thank you for sharing this nice system. For how long did you trade / test that system ? xpie

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Between 2 feb and 16 feb, i count 68 Y- 49 X = 19 x50 = 950 pips ???? and not -600 pips. Can you explain your excel sheet ?? thanks

--- 帖子 #131 ---
This month, I start counting round numbers like you, and I have in november 400 pips... I think every broker can change the results... only by one pip you can get different results

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Wow, with renko bar it is much much easier to backtest, take a look! I think I´m going to test from January 2008... Let´s see... I´m not married LOL

--- 帖子 #133 ---
You are correct my friend. I think I know whats happened. I tested feb over 2 day period and at end of first day it was -600. I simply forgot to go back and update the result to +900. It is not +950 because the first 50 pips of feb were added to jan result (trade started in jan and finished in feb) Cheers Logical

--- 帖子 #134 ---
First thank you for your fantastic job I know how long it could be... But i don't like this negative month : april I think there are 3 errors : column BN : 2 previous candles are red, we would have 50 pips instead of 0. column CV : 2 previous candles are green, we would have 50 pips instead of 0. column EB : 2 previous candles are green, we would have 50 pips instead of 0. So april should be -400 pips instead of -550

LudoLabo, how to get a good history m2? and where to download? i only have 64 bars ;(

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Zeublon As I said a few posts ago, I apologise if there is any wrong trades. I need you to proof read all of it. Can you please edit accordingly and repost excel sheet.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I start at the begining of each month. So here we are, i'm short from friday at 1,6700 with TP at 1,6650 and SL at 1,6750. (playing the range) I have a pending order : buy at 1,6650 TP = 1,6700 SL = 1,6600 (playing the range) I have another pending order : buy at 1,6750 SL = 1,6700 (playing the trend) time to sleep ...

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Right click your chart -properties - common - uncheck autoscroll and then put your chart on 1H TF or higher to quickly scroll back a couple of months or years back in the history. Add your script and go to your 2M offline chart. Now you should have months if not years worth of data.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
No problem, i think it's impossible to make 0 mistakes... When i will have time free, i will read it month by month. I'm very happy with your work, it shows the system bring us about 8700 pips this year !

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Oh maannn ! 3 hours backtesting and I see right now the renko bars are made of 100 pips!... You have to modify it right button in script and "modify" In the beginning you can see "Size of the box 100 pips" So, to modify, type 50.... "EDITED, IT DIDN`T WORK; STILL 100 PIPS BARS" HELP!! It was sooo easy... however, you get good results with 100 pips bar, too

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I am still not sure if I understood this method thoroughly. Is this correct? Buy when there are 2 consecutive green candles - 100 pips. And sell when there are 2 consecutive red candles - 100pips.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
You will have to restart the script once you modigy it to 50pips.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks for sharing your strategy. Upon discussion on Feb. 2009 results, I have backtested that month only by using IBFX (includes Sunday bars). The results are: Win: 112 Loss: 98 Net: 112 - 98 = 14 x 50 = +700 pips One thing to note, on Feb 13th, 16:00 bar we take a long trade at 1.4400 due to Red-Green-Red sequence between 1.4450-1.4400 and then next Monday price opens with a huge gap and we lose -200 pips as there was no way our SL hit at 1.4350, because opening price was 1.4209 (assuming we sold at 1.4200), so above +700 pips result includes this. Anyway, it is still profitable but then we have spread issue. Considering one is trading this strategy with a 3 pips spread broker and since each buy-sell action includes one 3 pips spread (otherwise backtest results will change because when price is at 1.6700, let's say, your actual buying cost is 1.6703 but since MT4 shows bid price you'll see it as 1.6700 on your chart which means if you put a limit buy order at 1.6700, you'll open position when price is 1.6697-1.6700 and if price reverses from 1.6697 or 1.6698 or 1.6699, MT4 will not show 1.6700 but we actually will open the position), the spread cost for Feb 09 is (112 + 98) x 3 = 630 pips which means we only have +70 pips net profit. If you are trading with a 4 pips spread broker, that means you actually lost money. I don't know the number of trades for other months (it can be even higher as Feb only had 20 working days), but it seems the spread cost is certainly an issue (considering we are trading mechanically and taking all trades, otherwise, if someone trades this method discretionally, then it is meaningless to backtest). Or another solution for backtesting may be to add spreads and using x.xx50 + 3 pips (or 4 pips) and x.xx00 + 3pips (or 4 pips) levels for all buy orders.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
You have to close m2 offline and restart MT4, then run the script again with 50 pips set and open again m2 offline. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Considering the post of Blackeagle, I must repeat that 50 pips in February were only noise because the volatility was more than double as it is now. I'd use at least 100 pips for a bar in February.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
With my manual system, when i'm playing ranges, i need 53 pips to make 50. I place my order in advance, so i draw a candle when my target is hit. In a trend, it's clear i don't sell to buy immediatly 3 pips less. i simply move my SL 50 pips up ... So i don't count the spread....

--- 帖子 #147 ---
the system is called "pip range bars". i use it myself and its wonderful for scalping. youtube it to understand how it works because its a quite much to explain.. great for when the market is moving fast such as news releases.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanks for the reply. A few things to clear this spread issue re. your reply: When your trade is a range trade, do you take long trade at 1.6603 (this means bid rate is 1.6600) or at 1.6600 (this means bid rate is at 1.6597)? When your trade is a range trade, you say you put +53 pips to your entry price. What about SL for range trades? Do you simply put 50 pips from your entry price as is the case for trend trades? When your trade is a trend trade, what is your take profit level, again +53 pips from entry? ps. If you can modify your post #137 with exact entry, TP, and SL figures (including spreads), that would be really helpful as a live example. Regards,

--- 帖子 #149 ---
As I understand, with 3 pips of spread, you always will win 47 pips and lose 53 pips if you want to respect the blocks of 50 pips without counting the spread...isn´t?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
You lose 50 and win 47 because you start from -3 and have 50 as target.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hello all, This system is simple, but it is very few the profit. I think 50 - 100 pips/day is good for this job. I trade without any indicator, but I always get over 50 pips/days. Here is my result yesterday: http://tintucfx.com/today.jpg

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Could you please be more specific?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
You are right! Maybe it would be good to backtest 50 pips bars and 100 pips bars, what do you think...? Or maybe... depending on and indi, a different bar every month... but, what indi?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
A simple way around this issue of 50 pip blocks is to use pip range bars. Sierra charts do it or you can use Ninjatrader for it. See image below, this is a 50 pip range bar chart. Apologies if this has already been used.

104 pips today again = 96$ http://tintucfx.com/2009-11-16_215330.jpg

Socchuot, would you mind sharing what system you use to get these 100 pips per day? Also, how long have you trade this system????

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi CaNaRyTraDeR, I will share my system later

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi SeaPip, I used my 100pips/day system some months ago. It is very accurate. I always use stop loss, maximum= 60 pips, normally about 15 - 20 pips. But if you want to trade with my system you must be fulltime trader. I spend 10 - 12 hours /day -&gt; get at least 100 pips/day. ------------------------------------ I will share my system later. please wait.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
hi socchuot, i spend also more than 10h/day and like scalping,it would be great if i can learn your system! thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Yes you're right. go to post n° 3

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Thanks in advance for sharing. In respect to this thread starter, perhap would you want to start a new thread for your system? I am interested.

example : i 'm now in a range, i'm short, i have sold at 1,6750 (the price to buy would have been 1,6754 for me). My TP is 1,6700 (the price needs 54 pips less to hit my TP) and my SL is 1,6800, so i will win 50 pips or i will loose 50 pips. If the price climbs up , i will buy at 1,6800 with a SL at 1,6750

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi Zebulon.. Just wondering how you went short at 6750. If we look at 2 previous candles...they were green 6650 - 6700 Green 6700 - 6750 Green So the next trade should be a BUY at 6750.. Please suggest if I am looking at it in a wrong way or...

--- 帖子 #164 ---
That is because he starts counting from brginning of the week.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Just look at my chart : the price went from 1,6700 to 1,6750 (green), then from 1,6750 to 1,6700 (red) and then from 1,6700 to 1,6750 (green). So i play the range and hope for a red...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Now i'm long from 1,6800, 2 previous candles are green.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
iam also long with t.p 1.6850 and i made it i got the first 50 pips thank u very much man for ur graet startgey......graet. good luck to every one...iaaaaaaaa http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #168 ---
You should be long again from 1.6850, do you close the previous long and reopen another one? Or just leave the same and move your stop to 1.6800?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
just leave the same and move your stop to 1.68 Yes you are right !!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I found some mistakes in august : column EK(+50), ET(-50), EV(+50), EX(+50), FE(+100), FF(+50), FH(+50), FL(+50), FV(-50), FW(-50), HQ(+)50= + 300 It would be 400 pips instead of 100 My backtest gives 450 ...Almost the same

November updated : total = 100 pips

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I think the backtesting with renco bar is not accurate... Anyone testing with this? I see too much winning trades, and only trend method...no range method... something must be wrong ... Can antone help on this?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
November 2009... Unfortunately this month is not that way What´s the problem? Why it is so different?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
What size Renko are you using? And something seems wrong with your script since the second to last Renko bar doesn't look right.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Renko doesn't shows the range because you need 100 pips down to have 1 red candle and 50 pips up to have 1 green candle.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Couldn't you use 25 pip renko bars? This could help in backtests.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi guys I have a buy right now at 1.6800, do you guys ahve the same order as me, just to be shure I am on the right track... thx Max

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes ! i'm in the same boat, playing the range.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
please, can you specify which broker you use? or how do you do those line in charts... thx

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Here's the solution.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
My broker is RTFX.com, very easy to draw those lines with this broker.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
hi zebulon, first of all thanks to post this system, i think that it's great i've a cuestion about the buy orders. i understand the manage of the spread when you sell but when you're buying if you open the trade at 1,6754 then you must put your TP at 1,6804 and your SL at 1,6704 or not?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
No, i buy at round numbers and sell at round numbers : now i'm long, i have bought at 1,6800 playing the range, the TP= 1,6850 and TP=1,6750. To play the range, i have a selling order at 1,6850 with TP= 1,6800 and SL = 1,6900. But i have also a buying order at 1,6900 because if the price hit that level, i will have 2 previous green candles. I have just put a SL (pending order) at 1,6850, no TP because in this case i play the trend and let the price climbing up, and adjust the SL...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
oks, thanks for your answer i have the same trades

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi, 8 candles since the beginning of the week. November = 100 pips

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I have counted your excel table in post 97 and my result for month of january is 2250 pips. How you have counted them 3500.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi The results for this method so so so so so so much depends on where you start the flow... You will get very different results if you start counting weekly or monthly or even if you start from say July and continue the flow till now.. because even if you start 1 candle late your whole sequence of GRGRGR..changes. So according to me you need to find where is the best to start as per your testing..but overall I think this method is profitable.whichever way you go (amount of pips will be different though).

--- 帖子 #189 ---
When you say :"if you start 1 candle late your whole sequence of GRGRGR..changes." I don't think so. Only the 3 first candles of the period would be different if you start at different moments. I personnally start at each month.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
So now the results for the month of november is 50 pips if I am still following the system correctly...I am short 1.6750....thx

--- 帖子 #191 ---
hello zebulon.. cool system.. from your experience, how many loosing streaks have u encountered? (just a rough figure) n what type of MM r u using.. thanks..

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes, i have the same. November is not very great with us at the moment

--- 帖子 #193 ---
another 50 pips for this month .....great it work very good thanks a lot for the system....great system... i made short at 1.6700 and the t.p 1.6650 and i mad it great guys ... good luck for every one ...hahahahahahahahah iam happy http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

yes i have long too

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I don't know but I am still short from 1.6750 with the trend stop at 1.6700???

--- 帖子 #198 ---
i was short from 1.6750, and when the price went to 1,6650 i put my stop at 1.6700 but it was touched later, forming a green bar. Then there was a red bar and i'm long playing the range. But if you're short with a SL at 1,6700 it's not bad ! who knows where the price will go ??

It would be great if someone could code the "pricechangechart" indi to start at psych levels of price (eg. 00 and 50), similar to how the "sweetspotgold" indicator picks out these levels. If one can get this indicator to do that, then I believe an EA would be easy to code as the buy/sell orders could be based off this indicator. Check out my attached picture below - you'll see that the indi's don't quite line up. I tried adding "extern" to the indi (also attached below), but it doesn't work properly. Now that I look closer, it almost appears the indicator doesn't line up because of the spread - perhaps the indi is based on bid prices instead of ask prices?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Got the indi to work now! Removed the time start from the pricechangechart code and now it seems to line up with the sweetspot indi. It may get screwy if you switch timeframes. Here is the modified indicator - put it on the chart with sweetspotgold and set the bar size to be the same in both indi's. Now, you could more easily backtest a month manually to see if there is an optimal bar size - 25, 50, 75, 100? As was previously suggested, the bar size should perhaps be dependent on ATR/volatility?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I think it should be a good idea, to be dependant the ATR... Let´s see... BTW this post is getting killed because of poor backstests... All indis I´ve tried didn,t work, you know, 4 hours doing backtest for nothing... let´s see your indi how´s perform! But, BTW I don´t know why when i try to download it i get a message of wrong attachment...

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Ok! I´´ve got it... I will take a look...!! ThAnks for keeping this post alive!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thank you for your work ! november = 50 pips at the moment waiting for more volatility...

--- 帖子 #211 ---
It is very good now, can you add the function for changing the colours? As it is, red candles get lost in the red back ground.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Howard, did you put the correct bar length? Default is 500, for 5 digit brokers... this indicator works perfect for me! P.D. take a look to January 2008... I think there is a big DD...

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yes, 50 for 4-digit brokers and 500 for 5-digit brokers, I have not done any back testing, for November the result is zero at the moment.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
zebulon : can u tell me ur results until today ? cause today i went short and the deal stopped at the s.l price ....... can u advise me ,

--- 帖子 #215 ---
the same for me, november i've made 0 pips

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I am red-green colorblind, so I changed the green to blue. I just did it in the code itself. Just click on the indicator, then select modify. Then scroll down to line 45 and line 55 and type in whatever color you want after "OBJPROP_COLOR" and then save the file. Then restart metatrader and you will get the result. I'm not a coder, so sorry I cannot implement this as a menu in the settings.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hope this helps some of you! Try out my backtesting worksheet - should make your backtesting much smoother. These are the instructions: 1. Put the two indicators on your chart set for the same candle/increment length (eg. 50 or 500 for 5 digit broker). 2. Open the worksheet and enter the candle length in cell B6 in pips. 3. Starting at C8 and working your way down, enter either B or R for Blue candle or Red candle. 4. Total pips will be calculated at cell G2. 5. If you need to add more lines, just highlight a row from Column E to N inclusively and drag it downwards or just cut/paste. 6. You could copy the entire sheet to add new months, etc. November is coming out at zero pips up to today, the 24th....

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Here's november backtest for 25, 50, and 100 pip candle/increment size. 25p = -275 pips 50p = 0 pips 100p = -100 pips

--- 帖子 #219 ---
November updated = 100 pips

--- 帖子 #220 ---
new candles : november = 100 pips

--- 帖子 #221 ---
One more candle and 50 pips more : novembre = 150 pips

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Zebulon, Interesting concept. I will test with the last indi's and will let you know if I have some contributions. I was thinking that we could filter the results a bit if we use some Forex-101 concepts (i.e. Support, resistance, price action?) Kostas.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
volatility is back ! november = 250 pips

--- 帖子 #224 ---
1h later, 100 pips more ! november = 350 pips

Hi Zeb, I have an idea, try to draw a 45° trendline and look how it is up down with 1 candle close out of trendline.... Lubo.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Counting this way for november are + 500 pips as min, could be more, depends on how many pips u getting out with the stoploss put to the low of previus bar. Lubo. Edit: i chaged the pips.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi, You're right ! this system is a different way to see the price. But you're wellcome to have your own money management or to play with trendlines and put a trailing stop

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hi lubolabo, can you explain with a picture? thanks

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I have drawed it on a paper. The concept is this, keep a paper with suqare box, every box is 50 pips, draw only the change in price on upper right or lower right the price changed and draw a 45° trendline every time the price change in the opposite way. Go long or short after the first opposit is made and stop the trade when another opposit change in price is made.....and so on. If I have time i'll try to post a pictures. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I think I have reinvented the renko chart..... Counting the pips with the rules in previus post the pips was 500 and now 550, i'm sorry for the error, I have thought box was 100 pips .

--- 帖子 #231 ---
The problem can be that you can be stopping out, with 50 pips SL, even if the candle close in the trend direction, look at wicks in the prev picture. Lubo

hi, GBP/USD is still alive ! November = 400 pips

Where did you get the Renko charts?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Very nice work.. I just skimmed this thread and I didn't see an indicator that outputs if its a "green" or "red" candle. However, after I saw that chart a couple posts up it opened my eyes on how easy it would be to just put horizontal lines every 50 pips. I am definitely going to start drawing horizontal lines on my charts. Rated this thread 5 stars,

--- 帖子 #236 ---
um, just use the indicator that I posted (and others have, too) a few posts up - its called sweetspotgold (plots horizontal lines) and pricechangechart (tells you whether its a red or green "candle"). Be aware that when Zebulon is talking about red or green candles, he is not talking about regular candles based on price - he is talking about arbitrarily drawn candles that are each 50 pips in size ...which is why some people are using Renko charts (to see this easier than on a regular candlestick chart). This is exactly why this method is not based on any timeframe since it's based on 50 pip movements. Make sense?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Here is a clean way of smoothing out the chatter,,,Go to your properties and eliminate all colors for the candles,,etc,,,,Now you will just see the 50 pip boxes,,,Nice! Also add a regular chart and place it next to your 50 pip box,,,,Then you can analyze your entries and exits,,,,,,Not sure if this what you guys are looking for ,,,But I thought it would be worth playing around with!,,,,

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes you're right for trend movements !

--- 帖子 #239 ---
nice observation there. but for this system.i think we have to at least check the prices every few hrs. cannot afford not to trade for a few days right? if not the wins and loses will not balance out. am i right? so u always open limit order for the nxt set up when u start the current order? what if when u go to slp and u miss a few wins? u continue to draw the lines and start from there? i want to try ur system. seems quite interesting! thanks for sharing anyway u said that if trending u going to put ur sl at 100pips. if u hit that sl wont u lose quite a bit of pips there? or its better to follow ur previous sl at 50pips. even if it hits its still not so pain. LOL.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Try some page back......on page 14..............

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Sure !

--- 帖子 #242 ---
No, my SL is always 50 pips. When the price give me 50 pips more, i move my SL, because in a trend, i just have a SL, not a TP, i move my SL each time i have 50 pips more. I said in the beginning of this thread that my SL = 50 and my TP = 50 because it's easier to understand. But in fact, i use both TP and SL only in ranges.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
i see i see. i think i nv phrase my q properly one the one u are slping. when u are slping right then u will miss a few trades. then will ur trades still be balance out? what u the time u slp are all the wins and the time u awake are the loses.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi everyone I have follow this thread for a while (ok ok I have been following since yesterday and I like it). I notice that people been asking about the USD/JPY and I have backtest the USD/JPY using the the 50 pips methods and I don't know if I did it right but I followed it the same way I learned it on here and here are my result since Aug - Nov. It would only let me backtest to Aug on my meta trader for some reason but here are the results. Aug: +50 pips Sep: -150 pips Oct: +150 pips Nov: +200 pips You don't earn as much as GBP/USD, but hey it doesn't hurt having an extra +250 pips in your portfolio right?

listen man first of all good luck and iam sure when u use this method on the gbpusd u will get more pips.....and i offer to u to try it on the gbpjpy, i think it will go better than the gbpusd .....try and tell me the results.

During night, the price doesn't move a lot (i'm in europe). Big movements for me are in the morning and in the afternoon. Usually, i don't miss trades during night because i have placed orders, but it's possible i miss few, it could be win trade or loss trade, i don't care. when i wake up, i draw the candles, look at the previous candles and play the strategy.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
haha. i see! cool. mayb someone want to try it on US/cad also? i think their prices have quite some movement.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
It's not better add more lots only to one currency that give more pips?... ....

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Zebulon, For EUR/JPY (November) studies show 1150 pips.... Any experience with this pair?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Waouh !! i did some test, but gbp/usd was better. Months are different. Maybe EUR/JPY had more volatility this month. That is necessary for the system works the best .

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Now i 've finished the live test for november . We had 450 pips I will begin december tomorow morning, watch the 3 previous candles and play the strategy . Bye and good trades zebulon

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Zeublon How did you tackle the issue of spread? From your live test it looks like you have not taken spread into account

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Zedbulon, Can you clarify the SL movement that you follow? Looking in my chart when price crosses below red box-A we enter short with SL1 at -50 pips. When price crosses below red box-B we move to SL2 (breakeven). When price crosses below C you could: a) Move to SL3 (50 pips profit) and your trade stops with the next blue box b) Take profit at TP=100 pips profit but you miss a probable move lower as often happens. Which option would you use? Kostas

--- 帖子 #254 ---
The spread is in the candle. I draw the candle when the sell price is hit when i'm in a uptrend.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
a) i move to SL3, playing the down trend.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Zebulon, Have you ever considered this pattern? V A V A V A V A V V A V A V A V A V You will never win with this pattern if you follow the rules on post #1. There is possibility it could happen !!! Just a thought

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Zebulon, How about this other pattern ? V V A V V A V V A This pattern also will cause your system as disclosed on page #1 to fail. What are your thoughts about this.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
You need to read the rest of the forum. In this pattern he would trade a ranged market so VAVAVAVAVA would be profitable.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I think you mean : G= green, R=red GRGRGRGR That's a good range for us !

--- 帖子 #260 ---
This is GGR GGR GGR GGR, that is the bad pattern for the system creating our losses. Usually, it is rare to find many consecutive GGR or RRG because the price is trending or ranging and so, we have more GGG or RRR than GGR in one month. It is impossible that a system works in all cases without loss. all we need is win &gt; loss

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Where did you start for December? if we play continuation of the range from yesterday it starts with a long from 1.6400. If we just start from today ignoring November, it is a long from 1.6500

--- 帖子 #262 ---
This morning, i saw the 3 previous candles were RGR, so i was long from 1.6400. December = 100 pips at the moment...

--- 帖子 #263 ---
you would have equal results starting at .64 or .65 i think, am i wrong?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Yes, you're right !

--- 帖子 #265 ---
This is the 50 pips chart every of u want.....

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I have counted start fro november to now 52 + and 43 - so there are: 9 x 50 pips = 450 pips. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Do the 50-blocks match with round numbers 50 and 100?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Is a good idea also. But need to count from JAN to Dec see ok or not lolz

--- 帖子 #269 ---
You need RenkoLiveChart_v3.2 (some page back) , download 1M history for GBP, then in option set chart to 1000000 bar for 1 year history, then open GBP 1 min put renko ea, you can set it to 25 or 50 (but it's not important), then open M2 offline, then put the pricechangechart1 on this, and in preferencies set the bar colour like the background..... Lubo.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
question for u again. i was blur when i read the part on u enter the trade on what price. lets say the price is 6500 and it is the 2nd green bar(50pips). then u would enter at 6497 or enter at 6500. and if it is in ranging. GRG then nxt shud be red. and price now also 6500. you would enter at 6500 or 6503? i think as long as we put a limit order of 50pips + spread. the price we enter doesnt matter. is it? or must we do the add or substract of pips to price first.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
If i'm waiting for 2 green bars to enter in the market, i put a buy order for example at 1.6500. So i will buy at this price, not at 1.6497. Now we are in a range (that's true !)we have GRG. When we were GR, i put a sell order at 1.6600 which is active now and we are GRG. So i sell at 1.6600, not at 1.6603

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hello Zebulon, The pattern I meant was GG, RR, GG, RR, GG, RR. This series will also cause a failure. My next question is lets assume that you have a GRG, then you sell at 6500. Where will you put your stop and where will you take profit ?? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello, I am new to this thread, just so I am following it right I just entered a long at 1.6650 due to GG(G1 from 1.6550 to 1.66; and G2 from 1.66 to 1.6650). Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Very good system I gess. But I don`t think it is worth to trade range playing like GRG sell and RGR for buy order. It is not prifitable . When you trade GG and RR for trend it is profitable... I trade at round levels like 1.5050 or 1.5100. dear Zebulon where do you see ranging 3 candles at this moment?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
of course I am long now

--- 帖子 #276 ---
From the left of your chart the 2nd green block and 1st red bock are wrong as price did not touch 1.6650 yesterday, ignore those 2 blocks and we have GRG

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Saintsurfer, My graph for the same period is different from 1.6600 to 1.6650 meaning that my price never reached 1.6650 (high 1.6646) so a green(blue in my case) bar was not drawn. So my last few bars are GGGGRGG. Did you do it by hand or you have a different feed?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
GG, RR, GG, RR, GG, RR. This series will also cause a failure : yes, but this serie is unusual. If this kind of pattern come too often, that means the box size (50 pips) is not the good one for the pair you're trading. If i have GRG, i sell at 6500 , my TP = 6450 my SL = 6550

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yes, correct

--- 帖子 #280 ---
here we are : december = 0 pips

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Observing some history I found that I can improve the results with the following rule: Assume GG so we will enter long at 1.6650. DO NOT ENTER ON THE FIRST trade trigger since usually price retraces. Enter on the second time the price crosses over 1.6650. We will probably experience this today with GPB???? P.S. I usually observe price at 15m so enter the second time a 15m bar crosses 1.6650

--- 帖子 #282 ---
But actually it is confusing becose it opened a new position for me at that prise bid prise was 16647 and ask for buy order 16650 so it was enough for me to get a loosing trade. OF course it is ok That was my first trade with this system that is way I bought at that prise not just mooved my stop loss if I were started earlier. Yes thats right I drowe it by hand. Just bloks.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Managed to long @ 1.6600, SL : 1.6500, TP: 1.6650 yesterday..after 2 consecutive G trending and TP reached. Now it seems like : G GR ... so, how to enter now?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
G GR .. i think next is buy order @ 1.6700 ( 2 consecutive G uptrending)..

--- 帖子 #285 ---
thats the case for my platform it is 3 spread. then wont the win always be 47pips and loss be 50pips. am i right to say that?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
i dont get what u mean by first trade trigger? explain ur whole thing again? ahaha

--- 帖子 #287 ---
look at this chart

--- 帖子 #288 ---
No, in a range, the win and the loss would be 50 pips if i sell at 1.6600 ( bid = 1.6600 ask= 1,6603) , i will buy at 1.6550 (bid = 1.65747 ask = 1.6550) or i will buy at 1.6650 (bid = 1.6647 ask = 1.6650). in a trend, my SL is XXX00 or XXX50, so the result will be a multiple of 50.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Zebulon, If you sell at 1.6600 and exit at 1.6650 you made 50 pips. But your net profit is 47 pips since you had to pay 3 pips for spread, am I correct ? If you want to make exactly 50 pips net profit then you will exit at 1.6647, right?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
if you made axsactly 50 pips it means you made 53 pips (3 for your broker)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
That is what I thought Saint. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
In blocks A, and B DON'T take trigger-1, but trigger-2.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Yes i'm agree with you !

--- 帖子 #294 ---
sorry for being not knowledgable enough but i dont get ur bid and ask price. what is the difference between the bid and ask price? if thats the case u will enter upon the bid or ask price? from what i see. its whenever i want to sell at 1.6600, i will sell it at 1.6603. or i want to long at 1.6600 i will long it at 1.6597. will it be the same for u? the entry 3 pips earlier is to cover the spread. am i right to say that

--- 帖子 #295 ---
What is the difference on final results?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
look at this

--- 帖子 #297 ---
ya if u do that.. that means ur net profit will minus away 3pips i think. since the spread is 3pips. haha. i am blur now. lol. am i wrong? cos u put it this way. long at 1.6600 and the order will be profitable after 1.6603. so if it hits 1.6650. u will earn from 1.6603 to 1.6650 which is 47 pips. and when the trade go against u. it went to 1.6550. u will lose from 1.6603 till 1.6650 which is 53 pips. no ?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I don't have quantitative results but observe the charts and you will see that it helps save some losses. In addition, retracing at round numbers is very common in FX. I am already following the method this way and helped me get in the trade with more confidence. Otherwise, you get in with the first trigger and then it retraces in your face 30-45 pips and scares you out. But the second time it crosses the thrust is more powerful.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
But the SL is always 50 pip so it doesen't matter.....

--- 帖子 #300 ---
LuboLabo, You are probably right but if the retracement is more severe it may save you pips..

--- 帖子 #301 ---
But in this way u change the method....

--- 帖子 #302 ---
When a buy trade is entered at 1.6650 you would want to put a take profit at 1.6704 (with a 4 pip spread) or 1.6703 (with a 3 pip spread) and a stop loss at 1.6600 so in this case you would make a profit of 50 pips after spread and if it went against you you would lose 50 pips. You would do the same thing on a short trade. Most likely if the price moves 50 pips in your favor it will hit your take profit order. If not you could close it manually.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
No, I buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price ...

--- 帖子 #304 ---
that means u dont that the spread into considerations? anyway u using any other systems to trade? haha. offtopic abit

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thanks zebulon... indeed it was long @ 1.6650..i failed to notice another G bar @ 1.6600 to 1.6650. I then took d long @1.6650, SL : 1.6550 (100 pips as we play trend) TP: 1.6700. Let see if TP is reached today. As of writting this, i'm 30 pips in profit. Guys, really, it is still 50 pips becoz we sell @ bid price and buy @ ask price.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
hmm i think if u put 100 sl will be quite bad if u lose the trade leh. cos u will need 2 wining trades to cover back the 100sl. thats what i think. and. ya u win 50pips but 3 pips will go to ur broker thats my thought

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks ja5on for d thought. That's why i would like to ask opinion from u guys especially zebulon on SL (in range play and trend play). Again, i think most of us misunderstood what zebulon is trying to say on buy @ ask and sell @ bid. Spread will surely not included. It is just the round numbers that he used. He sell by refering to bid price and buy to ask price. Don't confuse whether the price on chart(d round number level) has reached or not becoz price on chart based mostly on bid price. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
You're right ! i use net price, so there is 50 pips for me and 3 for the broker. About SL, i personnally use 50 pips

--- 帖子 #309 ---
thanks alot. haha. so zebulon, what other system or method do u trade by. cos i understand that u donnt always monitor the charts. my situation is almost same as yours. haha. so i might be able to pick up some stuff from u. =D

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thanks Zebulon.. but i think for trend play SL of 50 would easily reached. Haha..another 50 pips score just now..TP 1.6700 has been triggered. To look for another opportunity. Now we have 3 consecutive G Bar, so should we set for another buy order @ 1.6750?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
you had to buy at 1.6700, couse three G are in the back

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Ya right Baliuxxx..always forget to set the LO because too cautious to wait for the TP to trigger. Thanks again.. hmm.. it is a few pips away from 1.6700 right now..

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Ok.. here we go.. LO set @ 1.6700 has been triggered as the price retrace back. Let us see how the next move should be. From Wed-Thurs, i've secured 100 pips. Thank you guys especially Zebulon for this simple yet interesting trading system.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
actually in the trending right. from what i understand from zebulo is that he nv put a tp. so if it hits 1.6700 right. he just move his stop loss up to 1.6650. which means he dont have to open so many small orders

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Stopped out with 50 pips SL.. haha..it's ok.. we'll try again after next bar.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I trade only this method, because it is the easier and the most profitable method i 've ever found ... Why trading something else ? this one bring me pips

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Short @ 1.6600 after 2 R Bar.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
hi zebulon, i've made ea to backtest this 50 pips candle strategy. i can't get good result, maybe there is something wrong with the buy/sell logic that i use in this ea? stephen

--- 帖子 #319 ---
i don't know, what's the result for aug, sept, oct, nov ?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
ok, aug-nov looks good. what i asked is that is the buy/sell performed by this ea meets the rules.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Zebulon, now short @ 1.6600..so better put the TP @ 1.6550 or just let it move without TP? .. i've set SL @ 1.6650.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
only profitable from april til now testing this EA

--- 帖子 #323 ---
i' m short like you at 1.6600 and only a SL at 1.6650... waiting downtrend.....

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I don't use EA, so i can't answer if your EA respect the rules...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I don.t want to damage all of your dreams guys but it realy seems that the EA working corectly after the rooles and the results are realy good from april this year . But nothing good before it. So it is not any magic it is only a period now where it is working sucsesfully. It needs some kind of ability to adapt to the changing markets...

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Also to me EA work good, and backtested it on long run it was not profitable.... I'm sorry but.... Lubo.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi Zebulon, I have read through this excellent thread and am impressed with your work here. I seek your assistance with clarifying the entry rules. Could you confirm that once the two previous candles have achieved a range of 50 pips each (drawn green if bullish, red if bearish) you enter the trade. Thank you. forexnetworth www.forexnetworth.blogspot.com

--- 帖子 #328 ---
i have done a simular study 1 year ago. counting the daily candles ... up up down up down up up up up down up... finally somebody wrote an EA it did work one month, the other not and so on

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Yes, for example, now, we had 2 red candles (1.6700-1.6650 and 1.6650-1.6600), so we are short from 1.6600.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
hi guys this method is a great one use it and good luck , now iam working on a live mode and i have made 150 pip .....

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Stephen, First let me thank you for the effort to create the EA and share it with us. I think it will help us to test several scenarios and see if this technique has any merit. By the way, the EA works great. Working with zebulon's method I noticed a couple of things that I would appreciate if you can add in your EA (but with a flag to use or not use them): 1. A flag that when is on the EA takes only one range trade and then trades again when there is a trend. For example after a GRG the EA takes a short trade but then it stops and waits for GG or RR to make the next trade. 2. A flag that when profit hits a certain pip number the EA takes profit and waits for next signal. For example, we have set the flag to 100 pips and we get GGGG, the EA would take right away 100 pips profit and wait for next signal. 3. A feature to allow more than a lot trading. So if we are in a trend with 3 lots the EA takes profit for 1 lot at 50 pips, then second lot at 100 pip and third lot at 150 pips. I am not a programmer but I would guess from the above 1,2 may be faster to incorporate in your EA and I thank you in advance if you decide to help us with this. Kostas.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
hi everybody, First, thanks a lot for all of you who were involved in this thread and had spended time to understand, to backtest and inprove this system. Some of you manage to create an EA and it seems this EA is working well, according to the system rules. ( i'm not the good one to say that because i 'm ignoramus with EA ! ) Then it could be a perfect tool to test the system and its future evolution. Yes an evolution is necessary, because it seems the EA tell us this system is good since April, but not before. I believe only what i see, and i saw personally, trading live, that the system is good since august, bringing pips every month. Backtesting manually is very long and difficult, so i'm happy to find here in forex factory, people who come to help each other, whatever the result is. So i will propose you in the next posts, a different way to use the same system, a money management which allows to increase the results, and backtests since august which are very very promissing . I've been working on this evolution for 1 month, so i would like you to test it only in demo, until our friends who are EA specialist will say us : go !!!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
here is the backtest : august : traditionnal method = 450 pips evolution = 1250 pips september : traditionnal method = 900 pips evolution = 1300 pips october : traditionnal method = 750 pips evolution = 1900 pips november : traditionnal method = 400 pips evolution = 1200 pips december : traditionnal method = 0 pips at the moment evolution = 150 pips

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Can you please tell me what you do trading evolution method?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
The method is supposed to work in trending market and in ranging market. So, when does it not work ? Usually, we win a lot when there is a big trend or a big range. In other case, we win 50, and we loss 50, we win 50 and we loss 50 and so on. In december we have RGRGGGGRGGGRRR or +-++--+-+ Notice that it is very rare to have 3 or 4 consecutive -(loss) not only in december... because the price always goes finally in a trend or in a range. But it's possible to loose many pips on the way. So the new rule is to apply a litte martingale at the system : We play with 1 lot, at the first loss, we play with 2 lots, if we loose again, we play with 4 lots. If we loose 3 times consecutivelly, we start again with 1 lot. Because martingale must be limited, too dangerous without limit. You will see that evolution increase the result a lot. december : normal = 50-50+50+50-50-50+50-50+50 = 50 evolution = 50-50+100+50-50-100+200-50+100 = 250 Thanks in advance to all of you who are able to test it with an EA and tell us what are the results with this evolution before august. try it and good trades

--- 帖子 #336 ---
december updated : normal = 50 pips evolution = 250 pips

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi i m new this thread..and im trying understand the logic.A example..Verify if i undertood. If the price is at 1.6040 e this Up to 1.6090 then this is a 'G' correct? Then i save this price of 1.6090 e verify if the price will UP or DOW more for 50pips on the price of 1.6090... if the price to go for 1.6040 again then this is a 'R' correct?? Please.... this logic is correct or i m undertanding wrong?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Zebulon, i'm a bit lost on d evaluation method. Care to explain further? Now it is approaching 1.6500. 1st position : short @ 1.6600 , SL moved to 1.6600 from 1.6650 (0 risk) 2nd position : short @ 1.6550, SL still @ 1.6600 (50 pips risk) No TP set for both position yet. Now, should we put another sell order @ 1.6500?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
It's correct, except that i use round level : 1.6050 instead of 1.6040 and 1.6100 instead of 1.6090

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Looks like this thread is moving along nicely, good work guys. I like the idea of pip movements regardless of time taken.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
We had a short at 1.6600 (1 lot) because 2 previous candles were red. SL was 1.6650 no TP. The price went down to 1.6550, so we have moved the SL from 1.6650 to 1.6600 . But we have still 1 lot. When the price went up to 1.6600 we are stopped (Break even). But i consider the last trade is a loss. So we are trading with 2 lots : i place a buy order (2 lots) at 1.6550 (playing the range) with SL = 1.6500 and TP = 1.6600 I place 2 other buy orders (1 lot + 1 lot) at 1.6650 (playing the trend).1 lot with SL = 1.6600 no TP, 1 lot with SL=1.6600 and TP = 1.6700 I hope this could help !

--- 帖子 #342 ---
hello zebulon .. regarding the "semi-martingale" approach , i think it could work.. but more testing and maybe tweeking must be done.. also research on max consecutive losses encountered for example , in january 09.. heres the 1st few w/l sequence we got.. W L L W L L L W L L L L L L L L W as u can see there was a period of 8 consecutive losses.. meaning with the semi martingale syst, u would have lost 1+2+4+1+2+4 = 14 x % per trade.. (the last 2 consecutive losses was covered by the next winning trade) also from my back testing along Jan , 3,4,5 consecutive losses r not that uncommon so the best way to know which approach is better is to redo the backtest n see the results .. later..

--- 帖子 #343 ---
ahh .. another stopped-out. loss another 50 pips.. haha.. profit off 100 pips from wednesday went break-even.. is there a mistake that i should look and correct? A simple look, it seems that every after 3 consecutive bar (in trend), a reverse bar will emerge.. or perhaps today is NFP day, so market moves enormously.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
No mistake, just market law. we have to be patient !

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Zebulon thank you for sharing your system with us, it seems great In earlier posts you mentioned you enter at either 00 or 50. I've marked on the chart green and red lines to represent the green and red candles starting from Dec 1st 00:00 GMT The sequence I get is different from yours you start with RGRGGGG where as I get RGGGGG Can you explain where I've made a mistake? how do you get the first R &amp; G ? thx

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hmm then can i ask if we won the tp 100pips lot on trending. then shud we play on 2 lot the nxt time since the nxt one will hit the sl? i am not very sure when to start with the 1 lot again. its untill we reach the 4 lots? and the 3 lots is each tp at how many pips+1lot no tp? i dont understand how the tp comes into play in the evolutionary

--- 帖子 #347 ---
The first R and G are from the day before

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Correct sequence for both of you. Zebulon started counting two bars earlier. So he has RG RGGGGRGGGRRR and in your chart you have __________RGGGGRGGGRRR

--- 帖子 #349 ---
i think the profit this mth shud be 0 again right? did i count wrongly?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
You have the same as me. Just one difference, when i 've started the month, i 've watched the 3 previous candles (some were in november) to place my first order for december.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
After the first loss, you play with 2 lots. If you win, you start again with 1 lot. After 2 consecutive losses, you play with 4 lots. After you start again with 1 lot.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
What happens if 3 losses? Is this a form of martingale?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
HI there am al falasi from UAE , Dubai.. I have been trying to figer out how to trade the forex from 2005, sound its betting me to death :!!(.. some tim eam geting it right and some time wrong and in the wrong I lose much !! what to do please help

--- 帖子 #354 ---
If you have 3 losses, you take your -200 pips, and start again with 1 lot

december updated : today was not a good day, lots of consecutive losses... Yes we had 3 consecutive losses today and -200 pips. This happened 9 times since august, but the fact is that evolution system would bring us 5 600 pips since august... december : initial method = -100 pips evolution = -50 pips

--- 帖子 #356 ---
ok i need more clarification. cos after a win there is bound to be a loss cos the trend doesnt last very long. anyway how far the TP should we put. shud we just put 50 or 100pips i give an example now we talk abt the trend. if its two green(before that it was a lost). then i buy 1lot at 1.66 no tp. another lot at 1.66 tp 100 pips. but this uptrend only went up 50 pips to 1.6650. then it went down to 1.66 again. so it went back to 0 pips again. since both nv tp. ok same let us say now its GRGGGRR? so the nxt trade we must start with how many lots at the question mark? and what is the tp. do we start with 1 again since we already had 1 win? another example.let us say now its GRGGGGRG? so the nxt trade we must start with how many lots(sequence was loss win loss) but the tp 50 right since its ranging?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
In your example, you had a first loss, and you have 2 G, so you buy 1 lot at 1.66 SL =1.6550 no TP, another lot at 1.66 SL = 1.6550 and TP =1.6650. You save 50 when the price went up and you loose 50 when it went down. if you have GRGG G R R that means G is a win and R is a loss. So we have 2 RR and the previous trade was a loss, then we sell with 2 lots (1 lot with TP, 1 lot without TP). if you have GRGG G G R G, the previous trade was a loss. we play the range (sell) with 2 lots (both lots with TP)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
thanks alot. hmm. then if the 4 lots. also 3 lots with tp? and 1 lot with no tp? then the tp is always 50 pips only? =D

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Yes Ja5on !

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi Zebulon, How will you open the trades on Monday? I am confused regarding the pending orders. In my view you have to open at 1.64500 both a short for the trend and a long for the range. What am I missing? Merci Herty

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi, I'm short since Friday at 1.6500, when the price went down to 1.6450, i've moved my SL to 1.6500 (BE). I'm playing downtrend. But i've a pending order, buy at 1.6550 playing uptrend if the price climbs up...

--- 帖子 #362 ---
You've done a very good job on this indicator. Thank you, Constin

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hello Optojay, Do you think there is an error with the indicator? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks, Constin

--- 帖子 #364 ---
H[ Zebulon, ok, thanks I understand now. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif Herty

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Change TF to 15min and it should be OK. In very fast moves you may need 5m.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
december updated : initial method = -150 pips evolution = 0

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thanks my friend, I will try to smaller TFs. I think the indicator draws the moves based on the open/close prices rather than hi/low.A good coder can fix that easily. Constin

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Indeed, Constin &amp; Kostas! If there are price spikes that happen in a short period of time, the indicator won't draw it properly. I have done most of my backtesting on the M5 or M15 timeframe so as not to miss any of the movements. If anyone ever codes an EA for this system, it will have to rely on "everytick" mode (ie. run the logic after every tick) or will have to be run on a very low timeframe if it checks after the close of a candle (as it would miss the spike).

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Optojay, Back in post #318 Sangmane made a good EA that was following correctly the normal method. I also suggested a few additions to his EA at post #331 that IMO would help this method, but I haven't heard from him yet. Sangmane, or some other coder could you help us in optimizing this method? It's not that I would trade it with an EA, but an EA can quickly help us optimize and try different filters. Kostas.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hello Zebulon, I believe if we trade with the trend the results will greatly improve. I am testing this new idea and it seems to give more and less risky wins. I will show how I determine the trend later and how we should take the entries cutting back some payments on the spread.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Here is an example on how I would enter. I would also enter on a retracement of about 4 or 5 pips. That is if I am supposed to go long at 1.6500, I will wait for the candle to retrace to 1.6496 to go long. Then I will exit at 1.6550. This will give me exactly 50 pips in profit after paying 4pips for the spread.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
december updated initial method = -200 evolution = 50

--- 帖子 #373 ---
How about this setup? -+ = Long +- = Short Stoploss &amp; take profit = 50 pips 12 trades on the chart Wins = 9 Loses = 3 75% hitrate

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I like it, we should test it on other months

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Well Spotted! It looks good! By the way - Renko for MT4 - anyone know where I can find a script/EA/Indicator that works, as I have looked and cannot find one that works. Thanks, Vip

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Sorry ignore me... I have found one and trying it out.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I think the problem is the range . + - + - + - + -

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Here's the entries for the -+ &amp; +- candles.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I have desided to trade by folowing metod together with a litle bit of martingale system. My teory is that price moves 3 bars in trend and 3 diferent bars in range. So after 3 same color bars GGG or RRR I will begin to take oposite trade, and after 3 diferent bars GRG or RGR I will take same direction like the last bar to wait for start of the trend. There will quiet seldom be times where I become very risky becose of martingale. I will use martingale in this way,- first loose1(0.1), 2(0.1), 3(0.2), 4(0.4), 5(0.8), 6(1.6), 7(3.2)after six times in a row I will loose 1600 pips in summary. You see I do not start doubling after first time becose when I loose my first goul is to get brake even not profit, but there will be profit as well on the long run. It helps to use martingale one time more and not so risky. You may also lough if you want becose I know that it is posible to get in a very long consolidation or very long trend. You have to be clear what you are doing...

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Mmmmm...you are giving me a good idea....i will work on it

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I know an even better martingale progression...more safest...but we nees a 1:2 risk/reward ratio to make it work... and the idea of Lcfxtrader can do wel.. i'll work on it

--- 帖子 #382 ---
The problem with this idea is that when we have a succession of GRGRGR...... they all will be losses, and when we have a succession of GGGGG..... or RRRRR...... we do not have any positions

--- 帖子 #383 ---
No system is perfet...but we are gambling with a market...not a complitely random event... What are the probabilities that a range lasts more than 3 or 4 candles? What are the probabilities that a trend lasts more than 3 or 4 candles?? This is a probability game...we have to work on this..

--- 帖子 #384 ---
GRG(RGR) and R you win 3 times, thoses 3 between the brakets are loses bet you get break even with the last one(using martingale at that point u have to risk with 0.4 size) GGG(GG) and R gives 3 wins and with the last one you get break even trading 0.2 size at that point

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Here it is...what do you think of this?? I took the lcfxtrader's great idea...and improved in this way.. Case A Everytime there is a blu/red (or green/red) go short Everytime there is a red/blu (ore red/green) go long Our risk reward is 1:2, so SL 50 pips and TP 100 pips (2 blocks) As soon as the 1st block is completed (+50 pips) we move the SL to breakeven. If we win...good +100 pips If we lose...we apply this martingale progression... the sequence in mini lots: 0.10 / 0.10 / 0.20 / 0.40 / 0.80 / 1.60 Case B (the Best): Everytime there is a blu/red (or green/red) go short Everytime there is a red/blu (ore red/green) go long Our risk reward is 1:3, so SL 50 pips and TP 150 pips (3 blocks) As soon as the 1st block is completed (+50 pips) we move the SL to breakeven. As soon as the 2nd block is completed (+100 pips) we move the SL to +50. If we win...good +150 pips If we lose...we apply this very safer martingale progression...the safer that I know the sequence in mini lots: 0.10 / 0.10 / 0.10 / 0.20 / 0.30 / 0.40 / 0.60 / 0.90 / 1.40 This second martingale progression is oriented to "capital protection" with less exposure and less risk...and allow us 9 consecutive losses...but works only if we have a 1:3 risk/reward ratio.. Results fro November: Case A 1050 pips Case B 1050 pips Similar results...but the second Case is more conservative.... In November we had maximum of 2 consecutive losses...it would be interesting to test it in other months... I'm not saying that this is a good system...but had this idea and I will forward test it..

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Very interesting system....this is good for someone like me who is very new to trading. Thank all of you for your input.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi, I'm happy to see you thinking about all this and bringing new ideas. everybody is welcome to improve the system . december updated initial method = -100 pips evolution = 300 pips

--- 帖子 #388 ---
My new idea would have been +450 for December

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Actually this month is good for my method even without martingale it gives 750 pips plus. You have to understand clearly my method it almoust same like Zebulon`s original all I do diferent is that I after 3 one kind GGG or RRR I begin take reverse expecting consolidation and after 3 diferent kind RGR or GRG I go for trend depending what was the last of those 3

--- 帖子 #390 ---
What is the result for November according to your method, net without any martingaling?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
350 pips for November, I am testing that actually it would be better to begin reverse after 4 one kind and begin look for trend after not sure 2 or 3 range bars

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Can you detail please ? I don't find the same result as you .

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Thats all posible variants what I do,- GRG - G, RGR - R RR - R GG -G GGG-R RRR-G

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Ok , that's better ! But i find 450 pips by using all these variants on december. maybe i'm wrong somewhere ?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I have tried several backtests and the following rules create the curve in the picture from May to December 2009: 1. Go long when GG or RGR or GRG 2. Go short when RR 3. Always take profit at 100pips 4. Do not trade GGGG Kostas. P.S. Credit goes to Stephen (Sangmane) who has generously created an EA which recognizes patterns so makes backtesting a breeze. Please do not ask me to release his EA since he made it just for me and asked not to release it. Nevertheless, if you think it is useful maybe you can ask him with private messages to release it .

--- 帖子 #396 ---
550 for my count now first 2 bars of the month I take aswell becose we know what was last bars of November if it make sence

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Kostas, It is strange that no matter GRG or RGR you take long... is there a mistake? It can be that it works becose this year was more bullish, but in the future it can radically change...

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Saintsurfer, Agree with you, but no mistake. I found the above to work best and I thought I shared the results with you. I am testing other pairs now to see what's up.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I believe that if your ea had a filter like moving average, for egzample if price is over 200 ma with some distance GRG , RGR, GG long if below it GRG, RGR, RR short it would help to avoid oposite resultats in changing markets, but that`s just a thougt. I do not doubt these resultats you show but there is not garanty for nothing

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Nice ! very good job Kostas and Sangmane ! Is your SL = 50 pips ?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Saintsurfer, We had the same thought!! Here what I wrote to Stephen yesterday: "Stephen, Excellent job! Clever idea using pattern recognition as an input parameter. ... I find these results encouraging. I will try the EA to study other pairs and will let you know. If you get a chance and add a MA filter might also help filtering the bad trades " So, if Stephen gets to it, it would be a good filter in my opinion. Kostas.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Zebulon, As per your rules it is 50pips SL but I added the rule to take profit when 100pips positive. Kostas.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I've thought at this before ! 100 pips allow to jump some ranges... If you have GG you play long If the price climbs 50 pips up you have GGG, so do you play long again ? so you have 2 lots because TP = 100 pips or you don't play because your previous order is not finished ? What about the martingale, do you play always with 1 lot or increase the lots ?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Entered long some minutes ago at 1.62500 as per my strategy...if I can i will forward test here...

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Always 1 lot (no martingale). So when GG I go long and take profit at GGGG. Then wait until next trade pattern appears.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Kostas, do you use any indicator for making those bars we all use here, or does your EA use any ??? I would aprechiate very much if you attach it or link to it if you use.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I use PriceChangeChart1 and SweetSpotsGOLD. You can find both at the attachments folder of this thread. Actually, I think PriceChangeChart1 is brilliant since it allows to see actual chart data and then makes Red or Blue boxes on top.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
very good, thank you Kostas

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Trade Update: +50 pips...moved stop to breakeven... ...and armed a sell order if price retraces...

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hello Kostas, Great idea there on your modification. I sure would like to test the EA and give feedback. How do I contact Sangmane? Sangmane, if you are there please send me your contact info. Thanks

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Of course I am new forex trading. But I know some chart analysis. But this one 50 pips concept is never understandable to me. How can I draw such graph using just one pen and paper. Is 50 pips earning ensured everyday? how mush capital do I need to invest?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Glad to hear the indicators I tweaked are working well for you! It's too bad others aren't willing to share their works in order to improve the collective good. I know Stephen released his original EA, but for some reason held back on subsequent releases...

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I'm not trying to be negative, but what you are suggesting is effectively curve fitting previous data through visual optimization. This will fail in the long run. In order for a system to have longevity, you will have to come up with a strategy that is equal for long entries as for short entries... For instance: 1. If you don't trade GGGG, then shouldn't you stay away from RRRR? 2. If RGR results in a long, then GRG should result in a short entry. Keep the ideas coming!

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Stephen would be more than willing to release his EA. From what I understand in his experience people attribute bad results to the coders and that's what worries him. If you guys can PM him (private message) and ask for the EA, he would probably reconsider.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I was thinking of optimizing every 2-3 months for the next 1-2 months at a time. But some patterns should have continuous value (e.g. GG, RR, etc.). In regards to why RRRR and not GGGG my idea was that usually markets fall faster and deeper than when rising so the RRRR would have enough power to be tradable but not GGGG (at least not without a correction first i.e. GGGG R G).

--- 帖子 #416 ---
december updated : initial method = -200 pips evolution = 150 pips

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Kostas , Can you tell us the results with your rules for the past months (in pips) ? There are very good ideas in this thread and we could compare the different options and determine the best.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
My version of the system has closed the first trade at breakeven...and now is short... SL 50 Pips and TP 150 pips... Buy order armed if the price goes up..

--- 帖子 #419 ---
So you apply your "case B" strategy from your post n°385 ?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Yes.... I think that is a good solution even without any type of martingale because it has a good 1:3 risk/reward...and a good trade management moving the stop to BE after 50 pips... I think that the martingale needs to be applied very few times...and it's safe, after 3 consecutive losing trades you are using only 0.20 lots instead of 0.80 of others martingale... and after 5 consecutive losses you are using only 0.40 lots instead of 3.20 of others martingale... But I repeat..martingale is not really needed when the risk/reward is good... Losses happen most during range periods...and thy don't last long time on GBPUSD... I consider breakeven trades as neutral trades... It's very conservative.... Let's see how it progresses...time will tell..

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Update: second trade loss -50 pips ...now i'm long...GBP seems strong for now...hope in a rally...

--- 帖子 #422 ---
this mth have not been working very well becos of the yr end. every thing become very choppy. but according to the back test or zebulon original idea. its working fine i think. anyway have the modified ideas been backtested? =D

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I am forward testing my variation... I've asked a guy here on the forum (the creator of the RenkoLiveChart) to make a modified version of renko...that can display also range periods and not only trends...so we can have a chart like the chart Zebulon is drawing manually...and we can also backtest it... but he has not answered at the moment..

--- 帖子 #424 ---
i see.. thats nice. hope we get help from those that are good in programming. haha but his zebulon original idea is already not a bad one. haha. seen from the backtest results. positive for every mth. let's see how this mth ends with. =D

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Trade update: third trade: loss -50 pips now i'm short... 0.1 lots SL 50 TP 150 I've started my demo trading with this strategy right in a trading range situation... this is funny!! Here is where the system suffers...as all trending systems... But the range can't last forever...

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hey Chris, Good going. Keep up with the testing. I am also working on something.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
One more candle and 200 pips more for the evolution method Not so bad to play the range . December initial method = -150 pips evolution = 350 pips I'm long now, still playing the range

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello Kostas, I did contact Sangamane and he said that the EA is yours and that we should ask you instead for the EA if you would like to share it. Anyway, Thanks.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
According to your case B method, should'nt the size of this last trade be 0.2?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
no...the sequence is 0.10 / 0.10 / 0.10 / 0.20 / 0.30 / ... this is the third 0.10 trade... if I lose then the next will be 0.20

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Some of you have backtested the original method with the EA. Can you tell me what were the candles for the worst month in 2008. I would like to test something... Thank you

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Stephen is a cool guy and he respects that I added some ideas in this. Still credit goes to him for writing this. Since he gave his permission, I present you Stephen's EA. The operation is straight-forward and you can test various patterns. If some coder can help us add an MA filter it would be great!

--- 帖子 #433 ---
it should be april

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Chris, Zebulon's original idea of "playing the range" is not bad. I am trading this a little modified: When there is a range then take only one trade playing the range and then wait for a trending signal. This would allow you to take one 50 pip profit from a range but not loose 50 pip at the end of the range..... Kostas

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Thanks Kostas, I will test it and give you a feedback.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I have found that if you get a RG, then many times you cant go wrong going Red. The range has been my friend on 3 currencies the past couple of days +287 pips for GU, EU, and UC... All playing the range

--- 帖子 #437 ---
If nobody helps you....help yourself!!! I've asked some coder...but nobody was interested in doing this..... So....I've modified LiveRenkoChartV3.2.mq4 ... a few hours of work to understand how it was coded...and this is the result... RenkoRangeBarsV1.0.mq4!! Exactly what we need for this strategy!! It's basically the same as renko EA...so you can apply indicators on it (useless) or running Ea's on it (useful)... I'm sure it has some bugs...let's try it!! Place this file in your experts folder Open a 1M chart Drag this EA in 1M chart Open chart offline "GBPUSD" 2M chart Enjoy!!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Nice Chris, This helps visualize history better. It seems it missed one bar. Comments on the chart.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Chris, when I used your Renko it worked correctly without missing the green bar that I indicated in your chart.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I don't know exactly...I've only changed the way renko draws the candles...but remember that every data feed is different so it can happen that my chart is a little bit different from yours...perhaps for a few pips difference... I don't know how it works in real time...i'm testing it only from some hour...but at the moment it has not drawn a new candle...so I don't know... I'm noticing only a little bug...sometimes the current candle disappears for a few seconds...but I don't think it's a great problem...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Chris B, What can be wrong that it not appear on my chart, Ican make it smile and do the chart offline but not enough??? thank very much

--- 帖子 #442 ---
One thing I can suggest right now with the Stephen EA is to set it to trade the patern RGRGRGRG during 12noon to about 6PM Eastern time. The market is sideways during this period if there is no major news. I am still working on other patterns.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Wow...., Chris !! That was good man. I used to do C++ in school, but it has been a long time and I have forgotten almost everything I learnt.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Follow these instructions and it should work... 1. Place the mq4 code in the Experts directory. 2. Make sure to check the "Allow DLL imports" and "Allow import of external experts" boxes (both of them) are checked. they are under the Saftey section of the Common tab 3. Also check the "Allow live trading" box in the Live Trading section of the Common tab. Also make sure the Expert Advisors button is depressed in the Gui. When everything is good a smiley face will appear in the upper right hand corner. 4. Drop the ea on a 1 minute chart of any instrument. The comment will tell you which offline chart to open. To view the Renko Chart : 1. To open offline chart : click File(from menu) &gt;Open Offline and pick the chart you want.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I've only changed another code... :-) and it's not perfect for now... But when it will work properly we will can easily create an EA that trades the patterns..

--- 帖子 #446 ---
It smiles but not apear...strange

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I think too it may help to zoom the 1 min chart all the way out, turn off the chart shift &amp; auto scroll so you can scroll the chart as back as far as possible to give the ea more candles to work with before you attach the renko ea to the one min chart. After it generates the offline chart you can turn the shift &amp; auto scroll buttons back on in the one min chart if you want to. just my 2 cents... Great job Chris.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
IMPORTANT to view RENKO: Open offline chart : click File(from menu) &gt;Open Offline and pick the chart you want (e.g. GBPUSD, M2 )

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Have you opened the offline chart M2???

--- 帖子 #450 ---
thank you all it works now, needed m2 chart

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Here is what I see from Chris's chart. 7_wins and 1_loss. That will give 300 at least 300 pips

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Yes...the best thing we can do is test all the variants of the system and find the better results over the long time..

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Good job chris !!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thanks...I hope it will work well... I think i've fixed a little bug in the current bar...but i'm not sure... here's the updated version...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
GREAT JOB Chris_B! Way to take initiative and solve the problem! (Renko Script) Two thumbs up! So far, looks like just what we were looking for. Kudos as well to Zebulon for bringing the system to light!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Was about to mention that I didn't think the ea version was keeping up with the real price. Would it be very hard to make it into an indicator version so that multiple renko brick charts could be generated from the same 1 min chart? A script version would be great too for running back test etc...

--- 帖子 #457 ---
zebulon. u were asking the worst hit mth.. it was april. are u going to do a test or anything? =D

--- 帖子 #458 ---
did u test just on playing the trend? =D

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I'd like to, if i have the datas, i can't go back so far with my broker (not on little TF). On big TF i can miss some movements..

december updated : initial method = -100 pips evolution = 400 pips

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Trade update: another loss - 50 pips, now i'm long with 0.20 lots My sequence until now: BE -50 -50 -50 this range is stressing the strategy... ----------------------------------------------------------------- Here is the script version of the RenkoRangeBars. FX45Guy asked for it... It's basically the same thing as the EA version...but every time that you close and reopen your MT4 you need to create a new M2 chart... And...has not some EA feautures...like auto adjustment for 4/5 digits brokers and wicks... Personally I use the EA version... This file goes in th "script" folder...

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Yes play the trend. It is safer.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I've made a backtest on april 2009, which is the worst month of the year with this method. I took logical's datas (on post 102) who had tested manually. I found : initial method = -300 pips evolution = -1050 pips So it is a very bad month, but it seems it is the only red one, all the other months (2009) seems to be green. I think the alternative method (look at the other thread) is more secure. avril 2009 = 1 350 pips

--- 帖子 #464 ---
More profitable at the moment for sure...but more secure I don't know...that martingale can be a problem...it doubles the lots after every loss...

--- 帖子 #465 ---
it doubles, yes but only 2 times for both systems .

--- 帖子 #466 ---
is this advice for initial method ?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Yes this is true... When you did the backtest...have you tried to start with the other symbol? I suppose you start always the monthly backtest with a + order...right?? What if you do the same backtest starting with -?? That strategy is sensible to this difference...expecially when you enter in a trading range...it would be interesting see the differences...

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Yes i always start with a +, but i did'nt test with - first, no time enough. (sorry we are not on the good thread )

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Trade update: a new loss with 0.20 lots so -100 pips the sequence: BE -50 -50 -50 -100 Now I'm short with 0.30 lots SL 50 pips TP 150 pips the more time the range lasts...the more powerful it can be the next directional move...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Beautiful range !!! +50 pips december : initial method = -50 pips evolution = 450 pips

--- 帖子 #471 ---
woah... are u still backtesting on the alternative method? i tought this work pretty fine. i find it quite intimidating to open so many lots.. make me lose confidence if i lose the 4 lots.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Thanks Chris, Yeah, I probably won't try to use it in forward test either just for back test on the weekends in simulator etc.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
I hope EA allows us to backtest both methods. Personnally, i think alternative method is less dangerous, because all the months i have tested were positive. It seems it is not the same for 50 pips candles system in 2008. Backtests will tell us....

--- 帖子 #474 ---
actually this method if playing on a very trending market. it is very profitable. that is what i thought

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Which methot do you mean alternative? thanks

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Trade Update: last trade at Break Even sequence: BE -50 -50 -50 -100 BE total: -250 now i'm long...again with 0.3 lots because i consider BE trades neutral...no wins nor loss.. this market sucks...with this long ranging my version of the strategy is imobilized... let's see..but I think we will end this friday in range...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
That's another thread !!

--- 帖子 #478 ---
so u meant that the 50pips candle system have alot of losses in 2008?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I don't know, i hope we will know the truth with the EA

--- 帖子 #480 ---
When its in a range, when you get GR, go G next, if you hit that G, then Go Red, it works well. When it breaks out of the range you will lose 1 trade but then you can get in trending mode, GG or RR. To me, the Range is the best opportunity to make money. This works on other pairs as well. I'm testing it on 7 different pairs at the moment. Some of them 50 pip range, and some of them 40 pip range. At least this past week they all worked well

--- 帖子 #481 ---
oh so we still waiting for that programmer guy to help us with that EA? =D or have anyone been working on it already?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
hi man can u please tell me the time frame to update for your method ?????? and as i understod ; 1) RG = LONG 2) GR = SHORT and the t.p (100/150 pip) , i choose the 100 pip t.p and the s.l (50 pip) is this right ???? and can u write the results of ur back testing ???/ thanks and have a nice weekend

I've made only a November visually backtest with 1050 pips gain... I'm forward testing december... It updates with 1 minute data chart...and in realtime I think tick by tick...but i've noticed that when there is a fast movement it has some problem plotting the candle right..

--- 帖子 #484 ---
december updated : initial method = -150 pips evolution = 300 pips

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I've made some visually statistics to my version of this system...and I've noticed that if we talk of probabilities...the 100 TP is the best solution. I was thinking in 150 TP but...the most of the times when there is a good move it lasts 3 candles, so the first candle is the setup and the others 2 are the 100 pips TP. With 150 TP I have: some move of 2 candles that is a Break Even trade some move of 3 candles that is a +50 gain some move of 4 or more candles that is a +150 gain now...if i average the gains of +50 and +150...in the long time i have 100 average... but the 3 candles moves have more probabilities and have more frequency that the 4 candles moves... so... with 100 TP I have: some move of 2 candles that is a Break Even trade some move of 3 or more candles that is a +100 gain the risk/reward becomes 1:2 but my light martingale works anyway... I hope it makes sense...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I would like to explain a little bit why this kind of martingale is safer and "capital protection" addicted, and why we need a 1:2 risk/reward to make it work... the "classic" martingale doubles the capital exposure everytime we have a loss and becomes very dangerous after a few losses, the pro is that when you win you recover the losses and make some gain. (assuming 50 pips SL and 50 pips TP - risk/reward 1:1) trade 1: 0.10 lots - pips lost 50 (total 50) trade 2: 0.20 lots - pips lost 100 (total 150) - if win: 100 (total +50) trade 3: 0.40 lots - pips lost 200 (total 350) - if win: 200 (total +50) trade 4: 0.80 lots - pips lost 400 (total 750) - if win: 400 (total +50) trade 5: 1.60 lots - pips lost 800 (total 1550) - if win: 800 (total +50) trade 6: 3.20 lots - pips lost 1600 (total 3150) - if win: 1600 (total +50) with the "light" martingale...we have a different progression of the capital exposure, the pro is that we can have more consecutive losses, but when you win...not always you have a gain, sometimes you simply neutralize the loss. But you NEED at least a 1:2 risk/reward. (assuming 50 pips SL and 100 pips TP - risk/reward 1:2) trade 1: 0.10 lots - pips lost 50 (total 50) trade 2: 0.10 lots - pips lost 50 (total 100) - if win: 100 (total +50) trade 3: 0.10 lots - pips lost 50 (total 150) - if win: 100 (total +0) trade 4: 0.20 lots - pips lost 100 (total 250) - if win: 200 (total +50) trade 5: 0.30 lots - pips lost 150 (total 400) - if win: 300 (total +50) trade 6: 0.40 lots - pips lost 200 (total 600) - if win: 400 (total +0) trade 7: 0.60 lots - pips lost 300 (total 900) - if win: 600 (total +0) trade 8: 0.90 lots - pips lost 450 (total 1350) - if win: 900 (total +0) trade 9: 1.40 lots - pips lost 700 (total 2050) - if win: 1400 (total +50) trade 10: 2.10 lots - pips lost 1050 (total 3100) - if win 2100 (total +50) Now...with a simple look we can see that we can lose 10 trades instead of 6 and have the same pips loss...but with less lots involved...and this means less margin required... And we can see that in some cases we recover the loss and make +50, and in some cases we simply recover the loss. So where is the gain?? The gain is in the profitable trades... Martingale is there ONLY to recover losses...not to make gains... Now...it would be nice to see in the past...the probabilities to have more than 6 or 7 consecutive losses...

Today i'm numbers addict... Zebulon....there is nothing bad with this...i've only analyzed the numbers...to understand what happens on the market and to find a way to make your strategy the better possible!! I've analyzed the period between September 24 and December 10...so 2 months and a half... These are the results: Original Zebulon Method: 50 trades 31 wins 19 loss max consecutive losses 3 not bad!! Means 62% of wins Chris Method: 111 trades 32 wins 59 loss 20 BreakEven max consecutive losses 6 more instable!! Too many consecutive losses due to ranging periods, too many trades, and more or less 30% of wins Anyway...Zebulon Method has a 1:1 risk/reward, and Chris Method has a 1:2 risk/reward So...if we translate the above in pips we have: Zebulon Original Method: +600 pips Zebulon Evolution Method (with martingale): +850 pips (1550 pips without stopping martingale after 3 losses) Chris Method (with light martingale): +1600 pips and 1 open trade with 4 consecutive losses until now.. Considerations: Zebulon Original Method is the simple and safest one, positive pippage, no martingale, good % wins Zebulon Evolution Method is a little better...but depends much more on the consecutive losses...where the martingale works...in this case if he would not stop the martingale after 3 losses...the results would have been better... It still have a positive pippage and a good % wins Chris Method is the complex one...the martingale progression is not easy to understand, it has the worst % wins and is the stressful one due to the high numer of trades, big # of losses and consecutive losses and the breakeven trades, anyway has the best pippage due to the 1:2 risk/reward and the fact that the martingale doesn't stop after 3 losses... A high # of consecutive losses (ranging periods) can seriously stress this method. EDIT: I was curious and i did the same test for the other Zebulon method "Alternative method", in the same period it ends up with: 239 trades (every candle) 120 wins 119 loss max consecutive losses 6 50/50 as assumed.... but the strategy in that period ends with -1000pips... the problem is that the losses are bigger due to the stop of martingale after the third loss

Chris: VERY VERY lengthy posts! My question is are you basing a lot of these martingale strategies and results just from visually back testing? TIA

--- 帖子 #499 ---
For me yes, but we are waiting backtests with an EA...

--- 帖子 #500 ---
hey i started reading this thread a few days ago, and finally finished this one and alternative method thread..... now my question to you zeblon is " which method do you trade, the original, evolution or alternative?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I 've trade first the original, second the evolution and now i trade only the alternative. I have lots of hope in the backtests with an EA to tell us which is the best method and the best parameters.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Zebulon Thanks for sharing Can you be so kind if it's not to much work for you , to keep making the buy and sell marks (B/S or A/V) on both threads. If you can write your orders , as you used ti , it will be of great help to get used to this technique. Many thanks David

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I've seen many systems such as this.. More or less the same ,either you are playing the trend or ranges, it seems that this strategy has some loosing months.. as other systems did. The way for this method to work is probably using EA and VPS's , it will take some of the stress during trading or when the strategy suffers bad months. Bad months do happen, the question is how do you go through it with consistency. There is no excuse to miss any movement especially this strategy. Trade with consistency, with patience and dedication.......yeah this will work.But missing any movement will derail this strategy,unless you trade with discretion. You got to stick with it no matter what, sweet and sour. The question is,can you do this? Pls Look at this strategy within the monthly or yearlycontext, not weekly or days. This is IMO a true measure of the its worthiness in the looong run.Perhaps the possible heart ace during the negative month will pay off

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Good words there, super. The ability to stay with a system through rough spells and keep the faith is an overwhelming factor in being a successful trader. But on the flip side, knowing when to drop a losing strategy is also a key matter. Hopefully the EA will shed some light on the longevity of this strategy.

Hi forex noob here lol but I would like to know what "go long" and "go short" means? I like to learn about the forex

--- 帖子 #507 ---
[quote=maxwell-eqtn;3302112] I got 111 trades because my version of the system trades every RG or GR pattern...so i'm always in the market and i trade also the ranges... Zebulon's original method trades only the pattern GG or RR...it's not always in the market...so my method makes a lot more trades... But I have to say that i've found that my data feed has some holes during the period of september and october...so the pippage i've mentioned for the 3 methods is wrong... Anyway i suppose that in the long time the % of win/loss of the methods reflects my backtests... Unfortunately doing a visually backtest of many months is very difficult... We need an EA to do this...I can easily code an EA that uses my RenkoRangeBars (that can't in any case plot a large number of months) to test the past with the simples rules of buying and selling...but i'm not a great coder...so honestly i don't know how to code the martingale conditions...

--- 帖子 #508 ---
The martingale results are only examples... My martingale progression is known from many roulette gamblers...it's used to bet on the dozens or on the columns...where the roulette pays 1 to 2 if you win...so it's like a 1:2 risk/reward.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
hi, before use martingale, run the standard ea and see how many consecutive losses we have. from my backtesting, there are around 8 - 9 losses in a row from 1-1-09 to 10-12-09. and with this figure, even if we don't limit martingale level, the first win won't cover those subsequent losses bcoz spread. if spread = 2 pips, 5 consecutive losses will result : 1st loss : 1 lot * 52 pips = -52 pips 2nd loss : 2 lot * 52 pips = -104 pips 3rd loss : 4 lot * 52 pips = -208 pips 4th loss : 8 lot * 52 pips = -416 pips 5th loss : 16 lot * 52 pips = -832 pips total losses : -1612 pips the 6th trade :win with 32 lot * 50 pips = 1600 pips net result = 1600 - 1612 = -12 pips regards, stephen

--- 帖子 #510 ---
when i draw a candle, the spread is inside....

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hello Sangamane, Here is how I see the profit of Zebulon's method: if spread = 2 pips, 5 consecutive losses will result : 1st loss : 1 lot * 50 pips = -50 pips 2nd loss : 2 lot * 50 pips = -100 pips 3rd loss : 4 lot * 50 pips = -200 pips 4th loss : 8 lot * 50 pips = -400 pips 5th loss : 16 lot * 50 pips = -800 pips total losses : -1550 pips the 6th trade :win with 32 lot * 48 pips = 1536 pips net result = 1536 - 1550 = -14 pips No matter how you calculate the pips according to the evolution method above for the six-series shown you still will loose. Correct me if I am wrong Zeb ? If I am wrong show us how you would calculate the pips for the above six-series. Thanks

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi Maxwell, It seems both of us are wrong. How can we be a trader if we can't count our profit/loss correctly Price on the chart (candle) is bid price. And 50pips system trade round number (x.xx50, x.x00), doesn't it? Suppose that price go from 1.1950 to 1.2050 , this make 2 consecutive 50 pips bull candle (GG), will trigger buy. Assume spread = 2 pips = 0.0002 Bid price = 1.2050 We buy at Ask price = 1.2050 + 0.0002 = 1.2052 This buy order will be closed if: 1. Price go up, to 1.2050 + 0.0050 = 1.2100 (remember, our reference is candle chart which is a Bid price). We close buy order at bid price. So, P/L = close price - buy price = 1.2100 - 1.2052 = +0.0048 = +48 pips 2. Price go down, to 1.2050 - 0.0050 = 1.2000. We close buy order at this price, so P/L = 1.2000 - 1.2052 = -0.0052 = -52 pips Calculating again for 5 consecutive losses, we get loss = -1612 pips and at 6th trade, we win 1536 pips. Net = -76 pips Pls correct me if i'm wrong...

--- 帖子 #513 ---
. Hello Sangamane, The point is you win 48pips and loose 52pips.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
i don't care about the spread ! I always win 50 pips or lose 50 pips. When i'm in a trend, ex : i've bought at 1.6250 (buying price = 1.6250, selling price = 1.6246). If the price goes up i move my SL from 1.6200 to 1.6250. If the price goes up again, i move my SL to 1.6300. If my SL is hit, it is the selling price = 1.6300 (buying price = 1.6304) In a range, if i've bought at 1.6250 my TP will be 1.6300 (selling price), and the next order is a sell order at the same selling price of 1.6300

We are in one of the longest congestions of the last months... Trade update: my sequence: BE -50 -50 -50 -100 BE -150 -200 BE now i'm short with 0.60 lots...and armed with a buy order for 0.90 lots... Surely i have started the forward test in one of the worst periods...let's see how it progresses...i hope today we will break this range..

--- 帖子 #516 ---
It is right that we allways get 50 pips for profit and for loose but on the long term we will loose a little bit more for buy orders becose the price has to go higer and it means brobabillity is less for buy orders in some procens, I gess

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I will corect my self a litle bit, kind of order is no matter but generally becose we have to earn the spred for the broker it means that we have worse probability to win the position. And we loose more often. Dear broker cut the spread off please

Hello guys! I just signed up on FF. I want to thank Zebulon and all the others for sharing and working on this strategy! To lend a hand, I wrote a quick strategy tester that you can customize and back test all the way back to 1999. You can modify the testing parameters as you see fit: http://www.crescentkao.com/trading/zebulon.php Instructions are on the page. By default, the original Zebulon strategy is shown in the table and the current month is used. I hope this helps everyone out.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
INCREDIBLE !!! I like it, a fantastic tool. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #522 ---
november and december have exactly the same results as me. The other months, almost the same...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
it seems GG and RR are better than GGG an RRR ...

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Nice tool C-Speed, I tested the sequence GRRR and RGGG. My results were 313 Wins and 255 losses. Giving me total wins to be 313-255 = 58wins. Then 58wins x 50pips = 2900pips. I tested from Nov 30, 2008 to Dec 16, 2009. So if I started with a $1000 account and traded $50 per pip I would make 2900 x $50 = $ 145,000 in profit. If I traded $10 per pip which most people do, I will make $29, 000 in profit, etc. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Glad I could help It should make back testing a little easier hehe no more manual back testing! How far off are the other months as compared to your personal results? The back testing data I used is straight from MT4 historical data. You can verify that Red/Green candles the tester is using by comparing the Price Sequence listed at the top of the tester as compared to your own personal Red/Green candles.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Thanks Just thought I'd do my part and hopefully we can collectively improve on this strategy some more I made a slight update to the tester so it now outputs more statistical info for the sequences you're trying to test.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hello C-Speed, Is there a way you can include the option to change the number of pips? For example, If I wanna try the strategy on a 25 pips move, etc. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Sorry, that is not possible at this time. The script is not doing any price calculations on the fly. I simply took the RenkoRangeBars1.1 in MT4 and output a CSV file to import in to a database so the candlesticks are fixed at 50pips.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I will read the whole thread. Thanks to Zebulon for sharing it!

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Ok, this may help in producing a better strategy. Using the back testing script I wrote, I had it output the frequency of specific R/G sequences from 2 to 6 candles in a row. This is from 1/1/2009 to 12/14/2009. Frequency of specific sequences ( unsorted ): RR: 496 RG: 468 &lt; (48.55%) GR: 468 GG: 529 &lt; (53.06%) RRR: 256 RRG: 240 &lt; (48.39%) RGR: 230 RGG: 237 &lt; (50.75%) GRR: 240 GRG: 228 &lt; (48.72%) GGR: 237 GGG: 292 &lt; (55.20%) RRRR: 128 RRRG: 128 &lt; (50.00%) RRGR: 117 RRGG: 123 &lt; (51.25%) RGRR: 117 RGRG: 113 &lt; (49.13%) RGGR: 96 RGGG: 141 &lt; (59.49%) GRRR: 128 GRRG: 112 &lt; (46.67%) GRGR: 113 GRGG: 114 &lt; (50.22%) GGRR: 122 GGRG: 115 &lt; (48.52%) GGGR: 141 GGGG: 151 &lt; (51.71%) RRRRR: 63 RRRRG: 65 &lt; (50.78%) RRRGR: 77 RRRGG: 51 &lt; (39.84%) RRGRR: 63 RRGRG: 54 &lt; (46.15%) RRGGR: 46 RRGGG: 77 &lt; (62.60%) RGRRR: 62 RGRRG: 55 &lt; (47.01%) RGRGR: 59 RGRGG: 54 &lt; (47.79%) RGGRR: 55 RGGRG: 41 &lt; (42.71%) RGGGR: 72 RGGGG: 69 &lt; (48.94%) GRRRR: 65 GRRRG: 63 &lt; (49.22%) GRRGR: 40 GRRGG: 72 &lt; (64.29%) GRGRR: 54 GRGRG: 59 &lt; (52.21%) GRGGR: 50 GRGGG: 64 &lt; (56.14%) GGRRR: 66 GGRRG: 56 &lt; (45.90%) GGRGR: 54 GGRGG: 60 &lt; (52.63%) GGGRR: 67 GGGRG: 74 &lt; (52.48%) GGGGR: 69 GGGGG: 82 &lt; (54.30%) RRRRRR: 28 RRRRRG: 35 &lt; (55.56%) RRRRGR: 36 RRRRGG: 29 &lt; (44.62%) RRRGRR: 40 RRRGRG: 37 &lt; (48.05%) RRRGGR: 23 RRRGGG: 28 &lt; (54.90%) RRGRRR: 32 RRGRRG: 31 &lt; (49.21%) RRGRGR: 28 RRGRGG: 26 &lt; (48.15%) RRGGRR: 26 RRGGRG: 20 &lt; (43.48%) RRGGGR: 37 RRGGGG: 40 &lt; (51.95%) RGRRRR: 38 RGRRRG: 24 &lt; (38.71%) RGRRGR: 17 RGRRGG: 38 &lt; (69.09%) RGRGRR: 31 RGRGRG: 28 &lt; (47.46%) RGRGGR: 21 RGRGGG: 33 &lt; (61.11%) RGGRRR: 29 RGGRRG: 26 &lt; (47.27%) RGGRGR: 23 RGGRGG: 17 &lt; (42.50%) RGGGRR: 33 RGGGRG: 39 &lt; (54.17%) RGGGGR: 23 RGGGGG: 46 &lt; (66.67%) GRRRRR: 35 GRRRRG: 30 &lt; (46.15%) GRRRGR: 41 GRRRGG: 22 &lt; (34.92%) GRRGRR: 23 GRRGRG: 17 &lt; (42.50%) GRRGGR: 23 GRRGGG: 49 &lt; (68.06%) GRGRRR: 30 GRGRRG: 24 &lt; (44.44%) GRGRGR: 31 GRGRGG: 28 &lt; (47.46%) GRGGRR: 29 GRGGRG: 21 &lt; (42.00%) GRGGGR: 35 GRGGGG: 29 &lt; (45.31%) GGRRRR: 27 GGRRRG: 39 &lt; (59.09%) GGRRGR: 22 GGRRGG: 34 &lt; (60.71%) GGRGRR: 23 GGRGRG: 31 &lt; (57.41%) GGRGGR: 29 GGRGGG: 31 &lt; (51.67%) GGGRRR: 37 GGGRRG: 30 &lt; (44.78%) GGGRGR: 31 GGGRGG: 43 &lt; (58.11%) GGGGRR: 34 GGGGRG: 35 &lt; (50.72%) GGGGGR: 46 GGGGGG: 36 &lt; (43.90%) Sorted: GG: 529 RR: 496 RG: 468 GR: 468 GGG: 292 RRR: 256 GRR: 240 RRG: 240 GGR: 237 RGG: 237 RGR: 230 GRG: 228 GGGG: 151 RGGG: 141 GGGR: 141 RRRG: 128 RRRR: 128 GRRR: 128 RRGG: 123 GGRR: 122 RRGR: 117 RGRR: 117 GGRG: 115 GRGG: 114 GRGR: 113 RGRG: 113 GRRG: 112 RGGR: 96 GGGGG: 82 RRRGR: 77 RRGGG: 77 GGGRG: 74 RGGGR: 72 GRRGG: 72 RGGGG: 69 GGGGR: 69 GGGRR: 67 GGRRR: 66 RRRRG: 65 GRRRR: 65 GRGGG: 64 GRRRG: 63 RRRRR: 63 RRGRR: 63 RGRRR: 62 GGRGG: 60 GRGRG: 59 RGRGR: 59 GGRRG: 56 RGRRG: 55 RGGRR: 55 GGRGR: 54 RGRGG: 54 RRGRG: 54 GRGRR: 54 RRRGG: 51 GRGGR: 50 GRRGGG: 49 GGGGGR: 46 RGGGGG: 46 RRGGR: 46 GGGRGG: 43 RGGRG: 41 GRRRGR: 41 RRGGGG: 40 RRRGRR: 40 GRRGR: 40 RGGGRG: 39 GGRRRG: 39 RGRRGG: 38 RGRRRR: 38 RRGGGR: 37 RRRGRG: 37 GGGRRR: 37 GGGGGG: 36 RRRRGR: 36 GGGGRG: 35 GRRRRR: 35 GRGGGR: 35 RRRRRG: 35 GGGGRR: 34 GGRRGG: 34 RGRGGG: 33 RGGGRR: 33 RRGRRR: 32 GGRGRG: 31 GGGRGR: 31 RRGRRG: 31 GRGRGR: 31 RGRGRR: 31 GGRGGG: 31 GRGRRR: 30 GRRRRG: 30 GGGRRG: 30 GRGGRR: 29 RGGRRR: 29 RRRRGG: 29 GGRGGR: 29 GRGGGG: 29 GRGRGG: 28 RRRRRR: 28 RRRGGG: 28 RGRGRG: 28 RRGRGR: 28 GGRRRR: 27 RGGRRG: 26 RRGGRR: 26 RRGRGG: 26 GRGRRG: 24 RGRRRG: 24 RGGGGR: 23 RGGRGR: 23 RRRGGR: 23 GRRGRR: 23 GRRGGR: 23 GGRGRR: 23 GRRRGG: 22 GGRRGR: 22 GRGGRG: 21 RGRGGR: 21 RRGGRG: 20 GRRGRG: 17 RGRRGR: 17 RGGRGG: 17 You'll notice in the UNSORTED list, that I've paired the winning/losing sequences together. Also, I think if you look at this list, you should be able to determine what the most LIKELY candle will be to follow once a certain sequence of candles has occurred. I do want to note however, that using this list is trading strictly based on PATTERNS, which may not be the most optimal way to trade. We may still need to use an indicator to make better decisions and/or filter the trades.

trading at $10 a pip on a $1000 dollar account isn't advisable actually its insane. Anyway after using this great tool by C-Speed in the normal method if we factor in the spread it doesn't seem profitable in the long run.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
if you take a peak at the charts you would notice that for the most part, price never stops right at the 50, 00 level, it always goes a little further. Adding 2 or even more pips to your tp to cover the spread will not hurt this system.

Hello. I started this week with a 350$ account. I entered with a possition to reach the 1.6300. I will update the results every day i hope. Enjoi it

--- 帖子 #536 ---
C-speed, Good job on this! I also agree that although some patterns seem to favor profit a simple filter would make life easier (MA or other...). Hope some coder can help by modifying Stephen's EA posted earlier. I need to remind everyone that this EA can recognize patterns so adding a simple filter can help us perform quick backtesting. Kostas

--- 帖子 #537 ---
This range is really really really annoying me... it's 1 week that price doesn' move...

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hey Sauber, I think you're using too much margin on your trade If you win on one trade you've raised your account by 14%, that's heck amount of money but if you lose it's also 14% gone which is also heck amount of money. I suggest you'll start with micro account where 350$ goes 35000$ Money management is important! 3% to 5% per trade is well so good ^ ^

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi Kostas, coding a filter addition to that EA is an easy task. choosing the right filter, the best parameters for filter and the rules/how the filter interact with standard 50 pips rules is the most tricky part. it doesn't fair to ask me to add filter while you don't provide me the filter details. i'm just a programmer that learning how to trade.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
kan you tell me some good indicator that would be posible to make an ea with for this strategy. It is important those round numbers not just 50 move. Thanks

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hey Stephen is back in here! OK, then. 1) Easy filter: Moving Average. If Price when crossing the round number is above MA and agrees with long pattern then take the trade otherwise do not take trade. Example, we have GG from 1,6050-1,6100-1,6150 so when price crosses 1,6150 (shooting for GGG) and MA is 1,6120 then we take long trade since price&gt;MA. If price&lt;MA then we do not take long trade and wait for next signal. My suggestion is to use 15min bars as the base of calculations. Ball in your hands my friend! Kostas

--- 帖子 #542 ---
2) CCI Filter: If CCI is greater than 0 or a chosen positive value and pattern suggests long trade then take the trade. If CCI is less than 0 or a chosen negative value look for short trades. Example, we have GG from 1,6050-1,6100-1,6150 so when price crosses 1,6150 (shoot for GGG) and CCI is above 0 then we take long trade. If CCI&lt;0 then we do not take long trade and wait for next signal. My suggestion is to use 15min bars as the base of calculations. Try this: Put CCI(96) calculated on close price on 15min bars and put levels at -180, +180. Many times with GG if CCI(96)&gt;180 then always +50 pips happens (GGG). But if CCI&lt;180 then usually GGR happens for -50 pips. The reverse is true for RR and CCI(96)&lt;-180.

FYI: I've added EUR/USD to my back testing script. http://www.crescentkao.com/trading/zebulon.php

--- 帖子 #544 ---
It would be a great thing also to use 100 pips bars for testing. In periods where ir doesn`t work with 50 pips bars it works with 100 or even 200 bars.

what u mean for the evolution ?????????? whats that mean

--- 帖子 #548 ---
u mean that when we will have a green candel we buy ? and when we have a red candel we sell ? each candel 50 pip , right ?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
evolution method mean that you trade in same Zebulon original mode but if you loose you increase you trading size up next and third time until you win or loose third time. it goes so 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and after third loose or win trade with initial size(0.1) again.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
I thing and I see that original Zebulon or evolution strategy works, but in periods where volatility is high you have to use 100 or even higer bars like 200. I personally use evolution method with some exseptions. If last consolidation was made of tree or two bars I exspect tree bars trend and then I begin to take opposite positions until I find consolidation. And after tree bars of consolidation I trade with the last bar in same direction. If the last consolidation was made of four bars I also exspect trend of four bars and only then begin to take oposite positions. and after very long trend (five or more bars) I do not exspect consolidation made more then two bars so I go same direction of first oposite bar for corection of tree bars. I hope it is uderstandable.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I don't like very much the fact of changing the bar's extension... If a system works it has to work every with the same bar's pips...IMHO

--- 帖子 #552 ---
hi i suggest to use hedging or pivot lines , hedging to protect our money and then we can close it in profits ..???? what u think guys ???????

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I don`t like it either. But I think there is no system that can work without abilitty to adapt for a longer time. And that bar increasing or decreasing is what it makes posible to adapt I think.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
hi man i just wanted to ask u abut the RR GG its better than the GGG RRR r u sure cause iam a manager account and iam dealing with real money so as u think that its the best way ??????? thanks a lot.

With all due respect...I think that a manager account should deal with proved and secure and tested strategies...not with strategies under test...

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hello Kostas, Pls find 50 pips EA below, it seems using MA as filter give improvement in result. Adding Zebulon's evolution, almost double the account in 1 year. Unfortunately, it's only in backtesting lol. Your CCI filter seems contra productive. Pls experiment, tweak the setting, and post your result. Hands in your balls, ooppss, ball in your hand now... Edited: - EA corrected for an error on lot size - adding feature to save pattern as CSV file, which can be analyzed in excel by utilizing pivot table

--- 帖子 #557 ---
iam a manager account right and i all the time have to get new doors to be more sucsesfull... thats all my litle dear

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Stephen, You've done it again! Great job! Playing with the balls now and will update everyone later. Kostas.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thanks sangmane! It looks like there is a problem with your EA. If you turn off Martingale system, the EA generates an error. I changed the lot size from 0.01 to 1 in order to fix the error. However there still seems to be a discrepancy. If lot size is set to 1, you get 2 different results with Martingale on versus off. You should get the same results. I'm a coder, but I'm not familiar enough with MT4 EA code to make an immediate fix.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
i'm agree with that. Is it possible for you C-Speed to modify your tester and allow us to test also with 100 pips ?? It would be very great...

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I will add 25 and 100 pips to the tester, however due to the complexity and lack of time, I cannot make the tester work for custom pip ranges. Give me a few minutes.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Ok, 25, 50, 100, and 200pip option on GBP/USD is now available to back test.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Great job man. Tell me please if I want the ea martingale to go in this sequense 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 witch style I have to choose?Thank you

--- 帖子 #564 ---
hi there, can you post up the setting you make for it? thanks

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Did some quick analysis with my back tester. It looks like using 25pips produces the best results! Using these sequences: GGR RRG GRGR RGRG This month +225pips The last 6 months +7,175pips! From 1/1/2009 +4,300pips Using original: GGG RRR GRGR RGRG This month -200pips Last 6 months +3,000pips 1/1/2009 + 3,300pips *EDIT: Miscalculation in the number of pips has been fixed. I've updated this post with the correct results.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi C-speed, Do you play risk or martingale? Or just fix lot for each trade?

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Fixed lot.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
The reason for that is the lenght of time/number of trades. A better comparison would be to compare by the same number of transactions rather than a date range. If theory has it right, this system should shield the same results, regardless of the pip range. If you choose to use 100, 200 or 1000 pips, it's the same. The higher the pip range, the longer you would have to wait to see results. I bet that if you backtest by 25 pips you would have loosing weeks just as the current system has loosing months. I guess it depends what type of trader you are or want to be. A martingale seems to be the best fit for this system and although most people are terrified of martingale, this type of system are the ones that better apply to the concept since your losses are distributed among your wins and the 50/50 nature of the candles/trade direction change makes it very difficult to have a train of loses that is too long to sustain. It is not impossible, but I think with good money management and a way (indicator or similar) to tell us where the market might be going, then it might not be such a bad idea.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
ok thanks. Nice sequences you found here...Will try it new modify sequences you found. thanks

--- 帖子 #570 ---
the tester counts allways with 50 pips no matter what size you use, so the results will be smaller if you use 25

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Haha, oops! You're right.. I fixed it. I edited the original post with the correct results.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
BUT it is imposible to get simillar results on the ea and tester for now...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
C-speed, Can you explain the sequences? For example, when you mention GGR do you mean that after GG you sell trying for an R? And how about GRGR, do you mean after GRG you sell for an R? (I am trying to match the EA's results with your numbers which is why I am asking).

--- 帖子 #574 ---
You are correct. If you wish to enter LONG (BUY) when you see "GG", then the winning sequence would be "GGG" to use on the tester. If you wish to enter SHORT (SELL) when you see "GRG", then you will enter "GRGR" in the tester.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Thank you C-speed !

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hello everybody, I am new here, starting membership today. I am from Brazil , so any english mistake should be forgiven.. Regarding your 50 pips method, I am starting to look at it and using the 15 min chart it seems to work well too. and it seems very profitable I've been using something near that but with a little bit different method: I use Parabolic SAR as the first referencial. As soon as the first SAR point pops up, I subtract of it 50 pips or add 50 pips depending on what part of the chart it appears, and those are my Buy or sell limit order with 50pips TP, but as I have a little bit strong stomach I use 300 pips of SL and I can tell you that I am very...but very very very rarely stopped, however I work with mini-lots only in regular basis. To increase them I combine the SAR with RSI(14), but it only can be done using programming script with "if-else" routine. When 60 &lt;=RSI(14) &lt;= 30 I increase the lots in the order. As I use Meta4 (MetaTrader Plataform) I wrote a script that do that automaticlly...but it is still in test so as soon as I am sure it works properly I will post it here to share with those who uses the same plataform or other that allows to import scripts. Ok then...see you around

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Thanks C-speed. I am glad you changed your mind and made an option such that we could experiment with different pip ranges. Now the question is can some one come up with a rule for placing or choosing the orders such that wins and losses can alternate, but a win can not be two losses away in 12 or 14 trades. For example L L L L L L L L L W L W 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 is a good win. As another example L L W L L L W L L W L W 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 is also acceptable since a Win is not more than two wins away from a loss within 12 trades. If we have two Wins in a row (for example W W) at any point within the twelve trades we stop and go back and start trading again from One. Also at any moment if we have for example (W L W) we also stop and go back and start to trade from one again. This system was very successfull in roullette and Backarat so much that the casinos knew us and wiil stop us from playing many times. I have the Semi-martingale series written out for this. If we can successfully come out with a good trading method then I can release the series. However it is good to know that the Casino rules are some what different from FX.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi c-speed, thanks for the info about the error. I've accidentaly mixed up lots calculation. When Martingale On, lot size is based on risk per trade. but when martingale off, i used external lots setting (0.01). I calculated lot size as follow: 1. Initial Lot is calculated such that when we loss (all losses in this system is 50pips), the amount of losses equals to RiskPerTrade percent of account ballance. For example, Risk Per Trade = 0.2 (zero point two percent). Account Ballance = $10.000,- Then initial lots size is calculated so that if we loss, we only loss 0.2% X $10.000 = $20. So, lots size would be 0.04. of course if we enable martingale, the risk per trade will become higher then 0.2%, depend on what level we are at. 2. If we enable Martingale, I provide 2 style: a) style 1: for simplicity, based on our acc balance and risk per trade, assume initial lot size = 0.1. Max martingale level = 4. 1st loss, lot size = 0.1 x (2 power 1 or 2 ^ 1) = 0.1 x 2 = 0.2 =&gt; level 1 2nd loss, lot size = 0.1 x (2 ^ 2) = 0.1 x 4 = 0.4 =&gt; level 2 3rd loss, lots size = 0.1 x (2 ^ 3) = 0.1 x 8 = 0.8 =&gt; level 3 4th loss, lot size = 0.1 x (2 ^ 4) = 0.16 =&gt; level 4 5th loss, lot size returned back to initial lot size = 0.1 because level = 5, which is is greater than max martyingale level 6th, 7th, 8th and so on, lot size = 0.1 b) style 2 same with above excep at 5th, 6th, 7th and so on, lot size equals to the last lot size, ie: 0.16 c) once we have a winner, lot size, in this case, initial lot, will be calculated again based on current account balance about error when use lot = 0.01, maybe because your broker's minimum lot size is greater than 0.01. now i use MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_MINLOT) to get info on broker's minimum lot size. on alpari uk demo acct, i found that min lot size = 0.01. inspired by your awesome web-based tester, i've added feature in the EA (updated on my previous post) to save the pattern to CSV file and then we can open it in excel and doing some pivoting to get summary about those pattern. you can choose number of chars of the pattern to be saved. to speed up saving process, disable TradeThePattern, so EA will not initiate do backtest, and only work to scan and record each pattern. conversely, if you want to only backtest, disable SavePattern2CSV. attached below is an example of pivot table based on GPBUSD pattern. stephen

The last green bar on your chart has it reached 1.6150 level? At my broker only to 1.6147.So I do not have the green bar yet.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
With my broker, the price has reaches 1.6148 But with the spread, the sell price was 1.6146 and the buy price was 1.6150. That's why my buy order was touched and i draw a candle. That's why there is some differences between my manual candles and EA...

--- 帖子 #585 ---
but earlear didn`t you wait the bid price to reach the round level? So that it is more clear.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
It is a a not so little problem, a new order gets open and the one before stil need to go more up and even can not get closed if price finds the higest point there. I realy consider allways to use bid or ask price. Of course I will get diferent performance but the orders will be triggered at one time for cloce and open..

it would be nice if it was posible to buy and sell always at bid price and pay comisions insted of spread.

Hi Zebulon and friends ! I read the whole thread only yesterday evening in a cafe . Thanks for sharing ! Zebulon, with my Broco demo account I have (with simply the indicators) approximately 45 trades for this month. Because you trade manually, should it not be good for your pocket if you switched to a broker that takes a bit less commission ? Oanda is at 2.2 pips (compared to 4) for GBPUSD at this moment. 1.8 x 45 = 81 pips extra ! Easy money ! Ok, I know that the spread fluctuates at Oanda, but you could grasp at least half of that.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
actualy people should trade with an ecn broker and it would help a lot, for me too

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Yes it is very, very possible. All we have to do is trade (choose a pattern) such that the wins are not two places away from a loss. I have looked at your data on the alternative method and you win most times trading like this. But once it went more than 12-rounds with a Win (W) that is two places away from a loss (L). If we can find a pattern that will trade such that the wins (W) are not two places away from a loss in twelve or even fourteen rounds then we will win all the time.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I just opened my demo at MB ECN and they have a spread of about 1.5 to 2 pips fluctuating but the commission is also 0.5 pips. So that is not cheaper than Oanda. But I don't know a broker with 0 spread and only commission. Do you know one Saintsurfer ?

sangmane, Thanks for the EA fix. I just back tested with the new fixed EA, and it appears that using an MA as a filter produces WORSE results now.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi everybody, this is a profitable method, it is what the stats says, check for yourself this indicator i've developed, it is to count how many 'good patterns' and 'bad patterns' we have. The indicator has 1 single parameter named range and yes it is the range to count, but if you want to change it you must use a lower timeframe to count lower ranges. This indicator will show the winners patters and losers patterns, while winners &gt; losers will get a profitable method to trade. Take a look and post your comments. PSD Thanks Zebulon for share the method.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Thanks for this new tool Metroid. Do you mean by "range" the amount of candles that the indicator calculates the patterns for ? This way is a bit ruff. It should be useful to have a date setting so that we could let it start counting patterns (from - till) starting from the beginning of the month for example. So that we can easily verify it's correctness. The result of the count appears in the left upper corner of the down window. But have the green red stripes also a function for us ? Is the indicator calculating 50 pips Bid to Bid price, without the spread or including the spread ? How much spread ? Sorry to ask ... but this should be an outside parameter too.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
hi every one i just wanted to warn u guys that we have Calculate the spraed for example : if we have gain 300 pip profit and we have made 50 positions , means we got , 50x3= 150 pip spread .....the spread on the gbpusd is 3 pip so neto we have made this actuall month 150 pip..... so all u guys jaust make sure that u r calculating true profit pips and , the EA that posted here is not good ,sorry about that i have make backtest and its not working well , good luck and thanks for every buddy for help .

--- 帖子 #598 ---
is it a laging version of priceaction trend ?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
hi!, the range means the pips distance, 50 means that indicator will count the patterns when price touch 00 and 50; if for example you set range 25, the indicator will count patterns when price touch 00, 25, 50 I take note about date filtering, it is ok, but the first intention is to get accuracy about the method, because is there a possibility that the method dont work anymore someday.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi!, No it does not, really i dont know such indicator.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
alright, was thinking maybe we could calabrate priceactiontrend so were all on round numbers. it might be a bit mmore profit and well see are trade taken the same time.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I begin to miss movement in this thread ,any good fougts guys , or we met a resistance and there is no more space to grow?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I don't know if this will help anyone but it creates an ofline Renko chart which can be used as per normal chart. You add it to a 1min chart and then open the offline chart M2. It goes in the experts section. It will only run while there is data coming in.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Zebulon: Just a heads up on your evolution method. I updated my back tester to incorporate your Martingale strategy: Standard Lot size = 1 On first loss, Lot size = 2 2nd straight loss, Lot size = 4 3rd straight loss, Lot size = 1 http://www.crescentkao.com/trading/zebulon.php Your evolution strategy works VERY well from June 2009 to today, but from Jan 2009 to May 2009, it has HORRIBLE results straight from the beginning! Thoughts/ideas?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
You might be updating your tester site or it is not working at the moment?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Sorry hehe, fixed.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
My idea on the martingale. You can not stop increasing the lot size without a winner. You need to keep going until you win. My idea is to look at a very long history of R and Gs and see which method produces the less consecutive losses,even if we lose more times than we win, so long they are all together. Then start with a very conservative lot size. I know that even when you start with a 0.01 lot it can increase very quickly, but really, how ofthen would you see 12 losers in a row? The goal for me is for my equity curve to be upwards even if it upwards slow. Remember that the compounding works both ways. Sooner or later you would be able to increase the lot size. As far as I understand by reading online, martingale is made for when you have an absolute 50/50 chance of winning. No other system would be more fit for that than this one. That is why martingale is a bad idea on more discrete systems. That is why they did what they did in Vegas to crack it. Call me crazy if you want, but thanks God for demo accounts where I can try this for as long as I want.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
If you would try to play 200 pips bars and always would play sell buy sell buy you have big chance not to loose many times in a row even bigger bars like 500 pips, just a thought

--- 帖子 #609 ---
That is my problem and our problem : to find the system which works in all conditions. The system works very well actually, but we must search again to improve it to do well in backtest and well in the future !

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I made a quick test from year 2000 til now if I played with 1000 pips bars there were no more then one loss in a row results are 16000 pips(using martigale) . I always played sell buy sell buy (first bar was red)without exseption. it takes long time to wait for the next bar to apear. But the case is to be prifitable not to trade a lot..

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hi I think someone should make a EA that will give us a signal when to buy and sell. I wish I knew how to write the code but I can't. I think that if someone could make a EA using the evolution version would be a genius.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
HI,C-Speed, thanks for your back tester, it is very good,i am using it to back test all data from 2000 to 2008 and compare them right now. i just wonder if you are able to add zebulon's alternative method ( another thread) to the back tester as well? it seems that alternative method works better than original and evolution method. sam

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I will probably add that feature in next couple days. I'm curious myself to find out how will it performs over time. Xmas dinner tonight though, so maybe tomorrow sometime. I'll let everyone know when its ready.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I backtested your method and changed the R/G Buy/sell patterns for each month, based on the best ones over the previous 3 months time and they all performed WORSE than just sticking with your original patterns (RRR, GGG, RGRG, GRGR). I tried, previous 2 months and 6 months as well, all performed worse.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Dear friends, do yourself a favor and FORGET MARTINGALING. I traded it with real money and not in Demo. When you start to have BIG lotsize open positions YOU are not the same man anymore, than when you where demo trading. And even if you are the man with nerves of steal, the day will come that you run out of steam and you blow your account. Just my 5 penny advice of an old trader.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi... The file you posted with ex.4 extension doesn't work without the other one with the mq4. Can you share the mq4 also ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #617 ---
tell us more what happened. do u close on ur trade even before it hit the tp.. or what? but the martingaling that zebulon is doing is till lot size 4. not alot imo

--- 帖子 #618 ---
In this case Less is better. Zebulon proposes a limited Martingale, but others (PiPtHiEf) suggest to go farther, what is a big mistake imho. Consider also that your (initial) lot size will become very small and although you postpone your loser, your winners will be peanuts too. The Limited Martingale is explained by Zebulon in posts 351 and 354. Although I think Zeb makes a small mistake there, he said: "If you have 3 losses, you take your -200 pips, and start again with 1 lot http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/sad.gif " But If you have 3 losses in a row and you double everey trade you will lose: 1st trade 1 lot -50 , 2nd trade 2 lots -100 , 3th trade 4 lots -200 and that makes a total lose of -350. That will set you 7 winners back. Let's assume you trade 1 full lot on a 10.000$ account. Than after you lost your 2 first trades you will be 1500$ down. To open the next trade with 4 full lots you need (at 100:1) 4000$ margin, so if the trade opens your free margin is only 4500$ left. Very aggressive ! and not my piece of cake. (Not to mention that I trade on Oanda and have only 50:1)

--- 帖子 #619 ---
to zebulon: Great topic ! I thought about something similar a few days ago and now i found topic about it. to C-speed: Your page is absolutely amazing because my biggest problem is backtest. I beg you release php source your page + simple way explain how you get data forex history there. please please .. because i want to try example for 20 pips or some else pairs because i want to try other/similar strategy backtest it. Thank you very much man

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I've written a back tester for Zebulon's ALTERNATE strategy here: http://www.crescentkao.com/trading/zebulon2.php It looks like it WAY out performs the 'original' strategy.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Nice tool C-speed, thanks ! It shows us that in January 09 we had 7 consecutive losses according to this Alternate strategy. So: Even if you start with a minilot you have to open 12.8 FULL LOTS to open the 8th winning trade. Totaly ABSURD to risk (with 50:1 margin on Oanda ) 25.600$ on Margin, only to win 50$ Let's focus on the strategy in stead of kidding our selfs with Martingale nonsens.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
great job!!!!turely!!! thanks ,c- speed

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Ok, I've updated the back tester for the Alternate strategy, and the results are not very good. Martingale resets back to 1 lot after 2 consecutive losses.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Something is wrong because ex4 extension does not need the mq4 extension, anyway im preparing a new version, i will publish when it be ready

--- 帖子 #625 ---
You are right Catman, my heart couldn’t take 7 consecutive losers. Martingale is for the birds.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I've improved the indicator PRC (Pip Range counter), it will help us to count all favorable and unfavorable patterns for this method, you can change the parameter Range to test another frames and ranges different from 50 pips. The indicator will tell us if the method is currently profitable or not. If potential value is positive the method is currently profitable, if potential value is negative the method is not currently profitable. Remember that you need to switch to a lower time frames if you want counter patterns with lower range. I will add a datetime based filter after.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I did some testing today, and I've discovered that if you trade the following patterns: RRR GGG RGRG GRGR And only go long (GGG, RGRG) when the 10 day SMA is up and only short (RRR, GRGR) when the 10 day SMA is down, you increase your W/L percentage dramatically and increase your winnings.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
that is good,thanks ,c speed , by the way ,have you changed the martingale in tester yet? although, i think the result would not change much after changing the martingale

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Yes, I've fixed the Martingale Lots

--- 帖子 #630 ---
hi, c speed ,is this for 50pips or 25 pips?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
50pips

--- 帖子 #632 ---
*Deleted* Incorrect parameters

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Update: I made a slight error in my previous post. The 10 day SMA as a filter improves the results dramatically. I've updated my original post to reflect this.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Additional update: Ok, this seems to give the best results... 2-4x more pips per year. Patterns: RR GG RGR GRG Use 10 day SMA as filter. If SMA is up, only BUY (GG, GRG). If SMA is down, then only SELL (RR, RGR). I've added the 10 Day SMA to the back tester as well: http://www.crescentkao.com/trading/zebulon.php Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #635 ---
There can`t be much better strategy to use then this, good job C-speed, congratulations

--- 帖子 #636 ---
C-speed, one question if the last five bars are RRRRR, will yor tester sell only one time after the first two bars or four times in a row here? I think it is also dificult to interpretate the 10 sma for range trades becose it is quiet fast hard to shoose the position where it is reallynow . Could you explain how you tester works with that 10 sma more closer..?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
c speed, sorry for dumb question, how to set 10 DAY sma ON chart, in my chart, Sma always based on price.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
also, i think i confused with GG ,RGR, GG says you go long once you see G ahead,right? but when you see RG,why RGR is wining sequence, you see G ahead now,does it apply for GG now?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Great Job C-speed. This is what I have been thinking of. I have a modified Martingale series that can go for more than 12 rounds. It could be used with the chart bellow and the profit is out of this world. You do not have to use Martingale. However, you still will be a winner using the chart below.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Here is the Uptrend one

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hello C-Speed, Apply the rules on my chart to your tester using Martingale and let us see how it performs ? I am using 20-pip bars, but you could use 50-pip bars

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Sorry, I should have been more clear. Firstly, the 10 day SMA is based off PRICE. Not the 50pip bars. Second, if you get RRRRR, it will buy 4 times in a row.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Sorry, the 10 Day SMA is based on price. Not on the 50 pip bars.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Good question... To be honest it looks like if you did: GGG RRR RGR GRG The outcome is pretty much the same. So its up to you which way you want to play it. Probably better to play it this way though.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
What are your rules?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
SO 10 DAY SMA based on what time frame?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
A 10 day SMA would be on a daily chart.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hi C-Speed. Thanks for all the great work. I´ve being using your Strategy Tester and I´m very surprised on the results, specially using 25 pip. Basically I see that we need more volatility movements as in GU than EU. I believe we can see even better performance on EY. Can you add EY and maybe GY to the strategy tester? Thanks Alfredo

--- 帖子 #649 ---
OK C-speed, First we determine if it is an up trend or down trend from the chart. If it is a down trend then look for GR then sell to get GRR. If it is an up trend then look for RG then buy to get RGG. I do not know if your tester can determine the trend like I do. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
How are you determining if its in a trend? The current tester already looks for GR or RG, or whatever pattern you want.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
how can u know if thr sma is up or down??????

--- 帖子 #652 ---
^ Really? If the angle of the 10 day SMA is pointing UPWARDS (2 o'clock direction), then buy only. If the angle is DOWNWARDS (5 o'clock direction), then sell only.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
By determining the trend, this has becomes another follow-the-trend system, which I am not saying is a bad thing, but I think has deviated from the intent of a mechanical system.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
it looks promising when using 25 pips bar but please don`t be too exsited. Devide all profit with trades antal and it gives only a few pips per trade... it is nothing only enough for spread witch is not counted in the tester. I only see it profitable trading with at least with 50 but better with 100 pips bars. it looks less profitable but it gives more real picture.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
hi, c speed, could you please add frequence of consecutive losses to 50 pips system tester as well? thanks

--- 帖子 #656 ---
merry cristmas and happy coming new year

--- 帖子 #657 ---
i find that moust profitable are trading 100 pips bar and using these paterns,- GGR, RRG, RGRG, GRGR. it does not mean that these paterns are moust profitable but they give least consecutive losses(5) And if you would trade every patern separately it would give even less 4 losses in a row. It is not so bad such long martingale to cover the losses. What you think guys are you fresh?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Instead of using Martingale I prefer to use D'Alembert agressive mode if the consecutive losses are less than or equal to 5. It is safer not to drain down ones account. Thanks

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Thinking the same as you Saintsurfer got nearly the same results as you yesterday testing 100 pip bars, instead of GGR, RRG, RGRG, GRGR i was testing GGR,RRG,RGR,GRG have a look! In Profit every year with these sequences 2000 - 2009 Good Work! http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #660 ---
D'Alembert agressive mode seems to work really good, but you have to know the limit lot size and when to reset with initial lot size, have you any good thougts?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Happy Holidays Everyone! My thanks to Zebulon for presenting this idea and to C-speed for giving us a chance to test it. When you run a test check the orders sequence to make sure it's working, I found some inconsistencies. Perhaps I'm mistaken. Please check the attachment. Thanks

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Thanks for pointing that out! It has been fixed.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
C-speed, Awesome, will keep testing. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
C-speed, Here's another problem I see. If you take the sequences GG and RGRG, your end up with a buy and sell order on the same spot. Same is true for the opposites. Please look at the image. Thanks

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Just wanted to point out that, if you're going to use any kind of progressive sizing (e.g. Martingale, d'Alembert, Fibonacci, Guetting, etc), the only way that it will ultimately prove advantageous is if the larger sizes coincide with higher probability trades. It can be shown mathematically that MM in itself does not alter trade expectancy (I attached an XLS demonstrating this here ). Hence if you use progressive sizing merely to try to recover from losses more quickly, all you're doing is reducing the length of the losing sequence that leads to wipeout. Double your sizes and you more than double the probability of attaining irretrievable drawdown. The market doesn't care about your account balance. The primary goal of MM must always be capital preservation. If your entries and exits deliver positive expectancy, then you will succeed anyway, by simply applying consistent and conservative MM. Conversely, MM can never turn a losing system into a winning one. If it were possible to succeed with MM alone, then no market analysis would be necessary. Put another way, expectancy (which is ultimately the end result of how accurate your entries and exits are) determines the eventual direction of your equity curve; position sizing determines how wide the deviations (swings) are. I don't mean to sound in any way patronizing or negative. Hopefully it's helpful to understand the mathematical ins-and-outs of position sizing. IMO your basic approach is original, and I wish you many pips in 2010.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Good eye! Fixed again. The results are even BETTER now

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hi Guys, I would first like to thank Zebulon for starting this great thread, (may long it continue!), C-SPEED for his expertise in his back tester, and Saunga2and3 for pointing out any errors along the way. This now seems to be a system that we can add to our porfolio and run along side any existing systems that we use individually. The system is simple and effective. I will test this sequence RRG, GGR, GRG, RGR, over the next 3 months on Demo as this sequence seems to give the best results from 2000-2009 with only 5 consecutive losses (This may differ in future results.) Oh! and by the way this is on 100 pip bars, using 10 day SMA as filter and Zebulon's martingale 3 and out. Happy NEW YEAR to you all..!

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Have just spotted something on C-SPEED tester that if we just use the sequence of GR and RG on the 100pip bar it gives exactly the same results as RRG, GGR, GRG, RGR is this just a coincidence or an error? Any thoughts would be gratefull..

--- 帖子 #669 ---
THERE are not any errors it is just becose both paterns in some way are the same becose they will take oposite trade after each new bar.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
The laguerre i use it to trade on 1hr eurusd the system is simple, use it and make money and be happy , if i cannot have fund to trade i can help someone to trade ,and if i can be remembered for someones happiness i will be joyful . target is 70pips stop loss is 70pips trail is 60pips SYSTEM laguerre: period 0.7 rsi : period 14 filter : rsi 14 on 4hr chart buy when laguerre move just above 0.15 and rsi is above 57 in 1hr chart filter :now go to 4hr to see if ris is above 51 then buy if not dont buy never. Sell when laguerre is just below 0.85 and rsi is below 43 filter : now go to 4hr to see if rsi is below 49 then sell Obey instruction u prosper if u deviate u will perish

GGGG R G R R R G R R R R R G R R G R G G G G R G R G G G R R R G G R R G R G G R G R R R G R R G G R G G G R R G G G R G G R R R G G G G G G G R G R G G G G G R R G R R G G G R R G G R G R R R G G G G G R R R G R G R R G G R R G R R R G R G G G G R G R G G R G R R G R R G R this is sequense using 200 bar from 2009.01.01 and if I test this period with RRRG and GGGR paterns the tester say that there only are one qonsequtive loss. but there are at least four losses in a row. You can see that easily looking at this sequense. there would be taken oposite trade after three same bars and there are seven green bars in a row , so it gives four losses

--- 帖子 #672 ---
I'm not sure where you are seeing only one consecutive loss. I just tried it from 1/1/2009 and it says 4 consecutive losses.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
it is strange but it shows only one for this period and with these paterns for me...and only two from 2001

--- 帖子 #674 ---
ok I did reset and tryed again these paterns it scows now corect, sorry but i don`t know why it showed wrong, never mind

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Good new year to everyone!!! C-speed, can you tell me please exsact minimum sma slope angle if i want to know the trend direction? Sometimes it is hard to know does the sma allows to take position or not, especialy when the end of sma starts to change direction. Does it has to be stright to confirm? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
I don't think is using any slope. It just sells when price is over the ma and buys when price it's below. So winning orders move towards the ma. But still, something doesn't look right.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
C-speed, it's me again Check the pic, self-explanatory.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
C-speed says it uses som degree of slope so thats way I ask to be sure when I want to trade manually

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Fixed

--- 帖子 #681 ---
The slope is calculated as follows: if Current SMA &gt; Previous SMA Then Slope = Up if Current SMA &lt; Previous SMA Then Slope = Down

--- 帖子 #682 ---
And degree of the slope is not important just if the last ten days sma is more up then previous ten days so long trades allowed???

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I see, that little bug got me confused. So mainly if the ma is up it will only take trades going up GG RG, ma down takes RR GR. That makes sense now

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Yup! You got it!

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Its taken me 2 days to read this whole thread. But just to confirm: GG buy RGR buy RR sell GRG sell I'm playing with the RenkoRangeBarsV1.1 to make this work. Overall this looks nice and simple which is what I like.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
wonder where zebulon went to. holidays? =D

--- 帖子 #687 ---
hello all can we use the tick collector to draw the 50 pip levels into exel ......

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Another golden post, Hanover!

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Happy new year to all of you !! I'm back from holidays, and had lots of days to think, work, search about this method. With his fantastic tool, C-speed tought us the system was good the last months, but not before. We learnt that martingale was dangerous, even with 3 levels. So i go back to work and try to find something new to improve this system or a different way to use it, because my goal is a system which is winning every month... I think we are on the good way, but there is still work to do ! You are all wellcome here to bring new ideas.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Zebulon, I think you got a winner here. Problem is you need to adjust to the market's volatility. Martingale as money management doesn't work if your odds are not good. From what I've seen, the most you're gonna get with this system is about 68-69 win% rate. But mostly it ranges in the 50's. I think this system benefits from a 3 level martingale as it will level out the losses and let you keep most of the profit. If your odds are less than 50%, martingale can put you deeper in the hole. Read hanover's thread where a few members talk about why martingale works and why it doesn't. Thanks David. Take a cable chart and attach an atr with a setting of 14. I was using a 4h chart. Scroll back and check the volatility. Where you see atr reaching 100 pips or 0.01, you can see the price bars getting longer. With lower readings of 50 pips or less you can see little ranges from high to low. RG and GR sequences have higher win% during times of low volatility. GG and RR have higher win% during times of high volatility. But this is only backtest and without spread. The greenback behaves a little different. If you follow the same logic it seems to give back most of the profit during spikes or news. I find atr doesn't work too well. Following the pair's direction seems to be best way. Perhaps using the ma filter is the way to go with this one, but I haven't toyed around with this much. I hope this helps a little.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Anybody using the ea's? They don't seem to working for me. The 50pipcandle v2 seems to be skipping trades. I dunno

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I trade now with my "classic" method but i'm still on demo with this one and working on it. I will tell you when i 'll find solutions to improve the results...

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I may say what I finally found usefull from this thread that looks consistent and profitable enough. I use 100 pips bars, no any martingale,sma 1000filter(15minTF)witch means if the price is over the average I take only long and if the price is below the average I take only short. paterns GG-indicate long,RR-indicate chort But One important thing I take only one trade not trading til the trend ends. So it means that you can`t test with the tester or it needs `patern no trade ` function . In 2009 83 trades with 61.45 positive trades and it gives 1900 pips. You may self deside if it satisfies you...

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Thank you for this good job !

--- 帖子 #695 ---
can you please post a chart pic of your set up with some explations? I'm trying to figure this out as well. I like the idea, i also like the look and feel of renko but that may be my error. the renko is a strange indicator

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Here it is, you see those two first blue bars they are my trigger. For 100 pips.TP 100, Sl 100

--- 帖子 #697 ---
1.Are you using that "price change indicator"? 2.So you went long at the top of the blue box? tp 100 and the SL is at the bottom of the same blue box? 3.So you start counting green and red bars from Market open every week? Other wise we would all have different RG GR patterns. Need a universal starting point. Thx for your help.. I'm a noob but learning fast.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
1. Yes I do 2. I went long after 2 blue bars completed. GG and buy(BB in my case)tp100 sl 100 3. I don`t count anything just if I find two GG or two RR means buy or sell. And very important is the sma filter. That second blue bar has to close over the average 1000(15min chart) And second red bar below it.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
your filter is 1000 (on 15min) SMA or EMA? So right now we have 4 blue box's in a row (bars) your long over the last one since its over the 1000 line correct? or are you waiting for second confirmation from something else? Thx again.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I gess you are using 50 pips bars or something becose I only have three blue bars in a row. I use 100 pips bars.Only this confirmation. And average is sma1000. Actually odds are on our side if also to sell after three blue bars becose I only find profitable to go long for one blue bar after 2 first bars completed. So it means that it is also good to sell after the three blue bars.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
How do draw your 50 pips candles? Thanks

--- 帖子 #702 ---
You cannot set a rule on just one figure and to expect 600 pips ! I think there really more situation to take in consideration before !

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Price change indicator is for that..

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Is there any way to modify this EA to include a SL and TP level and only trade at the "00" or "50" level. The intent here is to only buy or sell when the price moves through these levels and maybe take 50 pip TP and have a 20 pip SL. ie. if price moves from the bottom through 1.6300 then it would buy and close trade only when SL or TP is hit. Then after that trade is closed and price goes through another "00" or "50" level, buy or sell etc. Only one active trade opened at a time. Maybe if we limit the SL to a lower number the total gains will be better than just trading the patterns.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I also found one very good patern and it is RG and GR. And I manage them in this way. 100 pips bars.Use sma1000 on 15minTF.When price is over the average and you find GR patern sell Tp-100 ,SL -150. And opposite for sell when price is below the average and you find RG patern buy with same tp, sl. From year 2008 til now it produses 177 trades and makes 4200 pips profit It gives about 70 persent wining trades. Risk reward is not perfect but becose of wining persentage it is working ok. And if to use same sl tp it makes only 1300 pips per this period.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I'm using the pricechange indicator that someone posted here.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Has anyone been using this method on a live account for a longer period of time? I have played around with systems and backtested them which always looked good, but then as soon as I applied them there was always something that caused them to fail on the long term.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
hi guys..interesting thread..thanks to all that posted.. i was looking at something similar in trying to localise price action by drawing boxes at various crossovers of certain indis etc.. (whole variety) but found nothing concrete as yet, but would like to give this a go.. i have loaded all of ea's and indis, but when i got to open the ea on a 1min chart, i enable all settings and ea's to run and get the message to open 2 in chart offline.. imy broker doesnt offer 2 min charts by the looks unless i'm missing something.. could anyone advise please. the ea i am trying to use is the RenkoRangeBars50 V1.. is his the correct ea for the green and red bars to be drawn.. is this thread still alive zeb et al? good luck naboo

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Price range indikator drows those bars. That ea can`t be used for anything serious.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I`m using 100 pips bars and 2 methods which I have discribed in resently posts. And I am confident with them, thats main traiding rule for me.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Hi ! Yes i'm still here ! I think even if the method was good last months, it is not the same if you backtest it in 2008... I'm looking for different ways of using this method, i would like every month is positive for my account. But saintsurfer's style is a good way .

--- 帖子 #712 ---
cheers zeb et al.. will keep an eye. naboo

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Sell oprtunity. After two red bars completed the price was under the sma so it is a sell for me. price1.6200 Tp 100 SL 100 It is not going my way until now and it doesn`t mean there is guaranty for evrithing. But if I will not try I will not know. All right i tryed and I know now, congratulations saintsurfer

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Well done saintsurfer

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hello Saint Great Job Tks for sharing . So 2 conscutives red blocks 400-300 &amp; 300-200 so you have a short setup You move from m30 to m15 to see if you have a trigger on the m15 , price is bellow SMA 1000 so you have a trigger for short . Entry @ 6200 SL @ 6300 TP @ 6100 trade result : +100 pips and what's now ? you are again in a short trade from 6100 as the previous 2 blocks were red ? What patterns do you trade ? Do you have a spreadsheet with your results ? Can u share with us ? Will be very helpfull, if you'll accept, to post your trades in real time , just to make sure we understand your system and the different patterens you may trade Tks David

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I use two paterns or two methods with these 100 pips bars. And everithing is described in posts 693 and 705. It is very simple.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Saint It's simple if you know ALL the rules . If you took a short after two red blocks ... An it turns into a winner... When can be your next Short entry ? You wait for 1 blue , 1 red , 1 red and only then you will enter again short ? so if price continues to fall down there is no short entry , you must wait at least for one block in the opposite direction and the two reds , so it's a minimum of 3 blocks combination ? Tks David

--- 帖子 #718 ---
thats right I trade only after the first two red or blue bars. You understand it right I gess

--- 帖子 #719 ---
tks

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Saint Can you pls confirm if I have understood the pattern correctly (and not the opposite way) Tks David

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Yes thats right. In this case I go against the trend and the sma works like magnet for the price.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Saint Why do you say you go against the trend ? You go with the same direction of the last brick... it's a continuation of last block...

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I go with the last brick it`s right ,but at the moment price is over the sma and if I sell I go against the trend.The sma 1000 is more teling about the main trend then one brick i gess. But sure the short term trend is with us

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Saint we have a RG pattern we check if price is bellow SMA1000 , if positive we place a Long order In this case Buy @ 6200 SL = 150 pips = 6050 TP = 100 pips = 6300 Pls confirm Tks David it will be great if you can post your trades

--- 帖子 #725 ---
what are the key advantages from a pip based system compared to a time based system?

--- 帖子 #726 ---
That`s right I am on this trade. And your chart is fine same like mine. So let`s whait and see how it will end...

--- 帖子 #727 ---
It is diferent but not necessary better or worse I think, it`s all depends on how you manage it..

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Can someone post the "price range indicator" Tks David

--- 帖子 #729 ---
here you go

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Tks Saint But how you make a block to start at 000 levels like from 6200 to 6300 I have played with the settings but ... What are your settings ? Tks David

--- 帖子 #731 ---
candle size- 100 open price- 1.0

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Tks Saint but .... it's not working any idea ?

--- 帖子 #733 ---
try this

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Perfect ! Do you draw the horizontal lines at 000 manually or with an indicator ? Tks

Saint so "finally" the short trade started at 25 Jan @1.6200 have came to it's end @ 1.6050 with a lose of 150 pips . Now after RR pattern we should be short from 1.6100 SL = 100 @ 1.6200 TP = 100 @ 1.5900 pls confirm David

--- 帖子 #737 ---
How has this method done over January, guys?

That`s just right.

Nine trades in total and 450 pips profit for both methods. GG, RR made 300pips(4profit trades and 1 loss) and GR, RG method made 150pips. (3 profit and 1 loss)

--- 帖子 #740 ---
first profit of this month with rr patern.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Nice trades saint !

--- 帖子 #742 ---
it`s good while the wins are bigger then losses.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I just tested on C-speed tester GG, RR, GGGGR and RRRRG, with 10 SMA and it it profitable with or with out Martingale (Martingale just doubled profit). There is result: Testing Dates From: To: Pair: GBP/USD Zebulon 50 Use Martingale (Reset Lot on 3rd straight loss) Use 10 Day SMA as filter Price Sequence (4,353 Candles): Hide Results: WinningSequence Winners Losing Sequence Losers Total Win% 433GR384817 53.00% 605RG5021,107 54.65% 72GGGGG63135 53.33% 50RRRRR53103 48.54% Total (W/L): 1,160 1,002 2,162 53.65% Total Pips: 98,050 82,450 15,600 I tested from 2000 too and it still profitable. Now, it would be nice to see equity curve as, when I glanced over the log visually, I saw around 3000 pips drawdown (for Martingale) . GG, RR, RG, GR profitable as well.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Saint and friends I can not configure the indicator to mark ONLY the 00 levels . Default is nlines 100 &amp; gap is 50 When I change to 100 , 100 I don't get only the 00 levels. Level may also change according to the pair I choose. Pls advice David

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Saint so we may have a possible Long trade @ 1.6000 price was just 6 pips from the entry price SL 100 , TP 100 ? let's see if we trigger this trade ... David

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Yes It is an entree at 1.6 about the indicator I don`t know how to do that. I like the lines to be every 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Metroid, Thank you for sharing this pip range tool. Now eagerly awaiting the datetime based input filter. If you can add drawdown calculator to it then it will be further helpful in hedging in same currency to preserve margin/capital and wait for retracement to happen which may take days or weeks but there won't be any loss except paper loss. Will need patience only. If the trading zone shifts you can see paper loss locked and wait for retracement to happen. pj

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi everybody, I am signing up and testing Saintsurfer's approach of the system. Great work! I'll keep posting my results and thoughts.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
What were your result for february, if you dont mind

--- 帖子 #750 ---
februar results patern GG, RR 4wins 1 loss(300pips profit) patern RG,GR 2 wins 2 losses(100pips loss) marth results 2 wins, every patern one win seems that GR, RG patern didn`t like this strong trending market last month

--- 帖子 #751 ---
AWESOME!!!!.... One more thong though, i seem to b having a problem plotting the 1000sma filter on my chart.. do i put the settings at "close" or "open"..the ma just wldnt show on my chart once i enter the paameter...u know anything i can do about that?...thanx in advance

--- 帖子 #752 ---
p.S...once i put the moving average back to 100 again it will display, i think it has somrthing to do with the "1000"figure

--- 帖子 #753 ---
ANYBODY STILL HERE?!!

--- 帖子 #754 ---
It is on close. on 15 min chart it is ema 1000, if you use 30 min chart it has to be ema500

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Saintsurfer, Thanks for your info about the results. You stated EMA 1000 above, and before you wrote SMA. Do you use the simple MA or the exponential? I got confused... Also, when do you start another pattern after a winning or losing trade? Let's say price goes GR, and you make a trade. It's a loss, so now it's GRG, do you go for the RG as well? Or if it's GRR, do you start the RR-trade then? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #756 ---
it is exponential ma. in the chart you can see a RG patern that was a lossing one, and after that there were RR patern that was a win. next trade with GR or RG patern will be only after trend. it is actually like RRG or GGR patern to be more presicely. but remember it has to be with acordance with the ema. RG and GR goes against ema, and RR GG paterns goes only with trend.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Thanks for your answers. You cleared my confusion. So you changed from SMA to EMA? Has it proven to be more profitable?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Sorry it is sma, I forgot myself. I don`t think it has any crutial importance. So you scould get same picture with both of them.But I use sma.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Thank you so much Saintsurfer, do you mind posting when you decide to take trades with your system more often. I really like the idea, i'm going to start trading with your version on my live from tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I can`t garuanty I will do that, due to I can be very busy sometimes.when I will be able I will do that. Anyway if you have rules corect it is very easy. You can set pending orders and you will not miss anything. Good luck. We will be on one side of the trades either wining or losing

--- 帖子 #761 ---
I doubt if anybody still trades this system not even zebulon, i guess.....

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I am trading this system. Demoing since a while back, and going live in the coming weeks. Great system. Simple and profitable up to this date.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hi Saintsurfer, Have you tested this system across pairs? Any other pair that you've had luck with? I am curious, why did you come up with 100 pip bars, instead of 50? I have checked the charts, and by my experience 100 pips seem to remove many false signals, but how about profitability, what are your experience? Also, why did you choose SMA 1000 on TF15? In my opinion, I feel that RR and GG patterns are a bit safer than RRG or GGR, or what do you think? Cheers!

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I am sure it is posible to trade diferent pairs, but it may need diferent settings. but g/u seems to work best with these bar size and paterns. So I am not breaking my head much to find the holy grail. I hope you understand that this system is dependent on price movement not time. But if you swith to higher time frame same 1000 sma will become double so stronger while you still see same paterns. On 30 min chart you chould use 500 sma to see same relationchip between paterns and sma. And sure RG GR is more dangerous due to negative risk reward ratio but it has a little better persentage exspextansy. So in general they are very similar in results, but they work on diferent conditions. hope you find anything helpful

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Saintsurfer, Thanks for your answer. Have you backtested the system, for e.g. last year? I tested last 6 couple of months, and all have been positive or BE for RR or GG. However it is hard to test, because of the settings for the SMA. Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #766 ---
2009 RESULTS 1750 profit for GR RG, 85 trades was made, max drowdown 650 1400 profit for GG RR, 82 trades max drowdown 600

Anybody knows if the 1000sma is above price,mine just wont show in my chart...

Hi Saint do u mind posting Dec 09 , Jan 10 , Feb 10 ...and March (till now) Tks David

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Do you only take trades from the boxes? Or from the recent high/low? In this picture using the boxes resulted in a loss but if you were going from the high it would have hit profit.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
i dnt get what u r saying, i entered this paritcular set up it was a loss though, but i take it and im looking for the next set up again.... what exactly do u mean by entering from the box or entering from the high

Resent posible trades, entries at x`s, one loss and two wins here.

Ho gods ! this is where it is start then ! ATR, VOLABILIII ect and Indictor number 10009... all to get a very simple method become a complicated rocket science theory.... really guy could you not make money simply like the creator or the method ???

--- 帖子 #774 ---
17 pages, when did you find the word cross here ? This method does not even need indicators ! Anyway, just a question : since you start in november, did you have any success ? We are in march.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Maxwell, did you try the system since december and find any loose patern as you described ?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Well, maybe your EA is not well coded...This does not mean that the method does not have any potential.....

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Do you trade this system?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Saintsurfer, do you mind if u helped me with a back test for Gbp/Yen from last year till date with this same settings of yours. i took a glance at it on the chart, it looked pretty good on sight (i just a need a valid data to back it up)..Thanx in advance,will really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I made some tests, it seems that this method works only good enough with 200 pips bars. gbp/jpy is more volatile so I find it very natural. With 100 pips bars it is not very good. When testing 200 bars I used 200 sl and tp for RR, GG patern and 200tp and 300 sl for GR, RG patern. And hourly chart with 500 sma on it. It gives similar results to gbp/usd just less trades due to bigger bars.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
very interesting system

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi Saintsurfer, Have you tested any other pairs, besides GU and GJ? I was looking at EU, with smaller bars of 50 pips, and it seems ok. I will have a closer look though. Also, I have a question regarding the patterns. You said before that RG or GR is actually RRG or GGR, but looking at the charts, only RG or GR can be just as profitable. However I may be wrong regarding this. What is your input? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #782 ---
I have tested many diferent pairs and gbp/usd seems to work best. and gbp/jpy with 200 pips work well. I will trade this pair as well. You can take every GR RG if you want it will work, just I think it has smaller drowdown only taking the first patern.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
hi everybody it looks like very interesting is here anybody who tries to make it automated this strategy with expert advisors?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Thanx so much for your input saintsurfer, but i think im really getting evrytin mixed up with this RG, RRG difference. can you please post a chart of 2 consecutive trade showing the difference in trades taken with RG and RRG pattern...Thanx in advance

--- 帖子 #785 ---
this is RG patern I trade, it is always the first oposite box after trend,

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Thanx you so much Saintsurfer, i get it now.. yet another question though,during your backtest,did u consider only the RG pattern after the tren (cos i see those are the only ones u do take) and again do u, at the beginning of the week consider how the the pattern from the previous week or ends or u just start the pattern count newly again?

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Just take first blue after at least two read or first red after at least two blue boxes. GGR patern above the sma or RRG patern below the sma and you will be just fine.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Saintsurfer, Thanks for your great support with this system. Always detailed and fast answers. Archie

--- 帖子 #789 ---
If we had used the first top line as the start of the 100 pip we would have entered at the third red line down instead of the bottom of the second box.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
We curently are in GGR patern and if it reaches the target 1.5 a RR patern will be valid. Just in case someone is in doubt

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Saintsurfer, Just a question of entry levels. Do you always make your entry and exit exactly at the 00-level, or do you wait for a breakthrough of some sort? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #792 ---
just OO level no exstra head break

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Thanks! Some posts back you explained the TP and SL for the RRG and GGR patterns. I wonder what the difference in profitability is when choosing SL 150 instead of 100? I really don't like the RR... Also, do you think that profitability for this system will change? It seems pretty robust, but requires trend. Have you had any losing months with this?

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Do you move your stops when a trade is one...say after to break-even after every 50pips or somehow...or do u just let your trade run ..lose or win

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Maybe you do not know RR,GG sl and tp is same 100 pips and for RRG,GGR sl is 150 and tp is 100. My exsperience is still young on this strategy, but it works good enough to trade I thing for now. And sure it can possibly change and stop working,many systems are not safe of that. The main reason it can stop working would be diferent volatility I think and it means that in some periods diferent block size work beter /worse.But the bigger size the more stable it works(I mean comparing 25, 50, 100 block size) I used to moove the sl to BE some time ago, but stoped doing this. It works better for me just leaving it as it is from the start.

RR pattern and trade executed this morning. Went south at first, but not going our way at the moment...

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Hi Are we talking about 2 or 3 patterns here...a bit confused.may be Pattern 1: GG or RR Pattern 2: GR (then sell if price above sma) or RG (then buy if price below sma) Pattern 3: GGR or RRG I do understand the first 2 patterns. if pattern 3 is different, can someone please explain a bit about this? Thanks

--- 帖子 #801 ---
GGR, RRG are GR, RG they are same. It just the way you look at it. Becose I personally take only first GR, RG so they can be called GGR RRG more presisely.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Saintsurfer, A lot of movement today. Last trade did not you our way, but hoping the current one does I wonder how you treat spread? Do you take it into account, that is buying at 00-level + spread? And it that case, do you actually use SL 100 -/+ spread and/or TP 100 -/+ spread? Archie

--- 帖子 #803 ---
I just set round prise, I do not think about it. Yes, no one knows how it will end yet. We only can hope that we still have some probability to win more times then to loose on the long run

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Saintsurfer, Hi again. I was thinking about the GGR/RRG-patterns. The rules say that e.g. RRG-patterns are only valid for a trade when they are below the SMA. However, the last RRG-pattern was right on the SMA (though still above it) and should have ended up in a winning trade. Do you have any results/comparision regarding taking these patterns only above/below or taking them regardless of the SMA? By the way, it's looking good right now... hoping for a continuation of the rise....

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Only the point of the closing patern need to be over/below the sma, if part of the patern is on the other side it is not a problem.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Hi, But e.g today the RRG pattern closed above, so that was not a valid trade, right? How strict are you, when it comes to distance to the SMA? Today it was pretty close, but still on the wrong side.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
No no you are right there is no exseptions. Todays RRG patern was not valid. There were only GGR patern that was valid yesterday. And RR and GG today. It is right or wrong patern no anything in between.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Thanks for your answer! Good luck with the current trade

--- 帖子 #809 ---
No problems man

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Something about this system caught my eye. I am currently deploying it on an EA in a demo account. I don't believe it's profitable in its published format. But I think it's quite close to be profitable with a little tweaking... Has anyone been experimenting with this in a live account? What kind of results have you seen?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Yeah,.i ve bn tradin it live for two weeks now

--- 帖子 #812 ---
hi everybody ! i'm back after 3 months of research, thinking about the system and holidays i see this thread is still alive, thank you saintsurfer for your good job ! And sorry for the poor sallary . My opinion is that simple is beautiful. Now,i will trade only GG and RR with GBP/USD 50 pips : if i have 2 previous green, i go long, if i have 2 previous red, i go short. i will use the 10 SMA filter : if the price is above the 10 SMA (TF daily), i only go long and not play the RR. If the price is under the 10 SMA, i only go short and not play the GG. The results with c-speed tester are : 2000 800 PIPS 2001 350 PIPS 2002 300 PIPS 2003 -450 PIPS 2004 3 300 PIPS 2005 1 450 PIPS 2006 2 850 PIPS 2007 400 PIPS 2008 3 650 PIPS 2009 3 200 PIPS I'm actually long from 1,5350 I will tell you my results Bye Zebulon

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Welcome back Zebulon! So you think that 50 pips are better than 100 pips? The results seem very promising, and according to my backtest of 100 pip bars, it would be better with 50 pips. However, don't you think that it will cause too many false trades? Do you have any stats for the same period for 100 pip bars? Also, do you take trades on the 00 and 50 levels, without exceptions, or where do you begin? Do you account for spread? Do you use TP/SL 50? I also noticed that the price bars indi does not really work on higher TF's. What sort of indi do you use? And the last question, do you go for continuing RR/GG-patterns? Like just now, with seven 50 pip bars in a row. Do you take only the first and wait until the trend is over, or do you take every new RR/GG-pattern, even if it's actually RRRR/GGGG? Thanks in advance! Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Nice to see you Zebulon again on your own thread. Good luck with fresh ideas

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Backtest with 100 pips are not so good... False trades, there are some, but there is only one negative year in 10 years, telling us that good trades &gt; false trades... that is what we are looking for ! Yes i take trades on 00 and 50 level . I don't care about spread, because the spread is inside the candle : i place my order in advance with round numbers. Yes i use TP/SL 50 pips. i don't use any indi. I just draw bars on the chart.. Yes i take every RR/GG pattern, if the SMA 10 is in the good side.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Thank you Saint, it seems your way is good for you !

--- 帖子 #817 ---
I think the reason why the back test of 100pips might not ve bn good was because you didnt consider the counter trend i.e the RGG or GRR counter trades against the filter. I ve bn trading Saintsurfer's method for two weeks on live...last week was profit, this week i ve had 2wins and a loss, im quite happy with that...rIght now im just waiting to see if we get a R..so i can trade GR pattern...BTW nice to have u back zebulon

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Yes I like more bigger bars, they give less signals and esear to catch the paterns.But moust important is consistence for me. Actually I do not test with that tester any more it does not give real picture, I think. But I know 50 pips bars they can make more profit in the periods they work.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Hi Zebulon Tks for sharing your results ... just to be sure 3 300 = 3,300 ? 3 650 = 3,650 ? Tks

--- 帖子 #820 ---
yes, 3 300 = 3,300.00

Firstly thanks to Zebulon for coming up with this 50 pips system and sharing it with everyone. I have been trying the different variations out and have come up with a slight adaptation. I'd be interested in your thoughts. In general, on cable, the price tends to 'rest' in the 50s and then make a move over 00s before coming to rest again in the 50s, either 100 up or 100 down. Obviously it sometimes touches the 00 and then retraces back, but in my observations 66% of the time it completes the move. At present, according to my sma we are in a rising market. So. place a sell order for 1 lot at the ***50, e.g. 15250. When the price increase to 15300, place a buy order for 2 lots. If as predicted it continues to 15350 we are 1 lot up. However if the price drops from 15250 to 15200 place another sell order at 15200 in the hope that it will continue to 15150. This is how the various scenarios play out; 15250 - 1 sell order - rises to 15300 - 2 buy orders - rises to 15350 - 50 pips profit. 15250 - 1 sell order - drops to 15200 - 1 sell order - drops to 15150 - 100 pips profit 15250 - 1 sell order - drops to 15200 - 1 sell order - rises again to 15250 - break even 15250 - 1 sell order - rises to 15300 - 2 buy orders - drops again to 15250 - 150 pips down - this is the only scenario I cannot reconcile which is why you need to play it according to the sma of your choice. If the sma indicates we are in a declining market we need to reverse the above, i.e. start with a buy for 1 lot and if it drops reverse to a sell order for 2 lots. Thoughts please? P.S. - I am currently long with 2 lots at 15300.

Hi, How do you treat situations like this, when price has moved over 100 pips down, but since it didn't reach 1.5400, the move was actually not a valid R-bar, since it had to reach 1.5200 for that. Strictly following the 00-levels or 50-levels?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Zebulon can u pls explain about c-speed tester . It's a back test program ? Can u post a link ? Tks

Hi, Is any of the EA's in this thread working, or is there a working one anywhere? I would like to do some testing and perhaps try to use it, when I don't have time to watch the screen. Even though EA's actually never worked for me.... Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Hi guys, here you go an EA for trading paterns used on this thread. I personaly trade only GG, RR and GR RG paterns and here are the settings you will need for trading these paterns. Try it on demo, backtest it and you will see if it worth anything. GG , RR 100 pips box patern trading setings , with 500 sma on a 30min GBP / USD Work reverse - false Take profit - 100 Stop loss - 100 Pip range - 100 Lots - trading size you wish to trade Money management ( personaly I do not use . Make a try ) Set to false if not used . MM mode - 2 ( means the ea will use D `A lembert money management, when adding the initial amount in trading size after a loss until previous deposit will be reached and then will begin with initial lot size . Note it is not a martingale it just add after loosing trade . But sure it increases trading risk so be aware and test it on demo first ) Lots init - initial lot size you wish to start if money management is set to true . Trade the patern - true Patern no trade - GGG , RRR Patern buy - GG Patern sell - RR UseMA - true Ma period - 500 Everything else has to be set to false GR , RG 100pips box patern trading setings with 500 sma on a30min GBP / USD Work reverse - true Take profit - 100 Stoploss - 150 Piprange - 100 Lots - trading size you wish to trade Money management - False Trade the patern - true Patern no trade - GRG , RGR Patern buy - GR Patern sell - RG UseMA - true MA period500 Everithing else has to be set to false PS when trading on real market or on demo it can be that the EA will not take the first paterns that apear. Don`t know the reason. But it works good enough on the whole. Enjoy.

3win 1loss for me this week based on saintsurfer method.....Lets see how next week turns out....btw...3weeks in row with wins overall.. Thanx saintsurfer, i owe u one

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Hi, Thanks Saintsurfer! Great work with the EA and of course with the entire system. Have a nice weekend! Archie

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Guys i have backtested this system for the last year and the results are in attach, is this what is expected or something is missing ?? set file also in attach

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hi Which method have u tested.. I mean 50bar or 100 bar..... RR,GG, RG or which SMA.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Saint Tks you for sharing your EA . When trying to download the file ...I get it's a PHP file Can someone help on that ... Tks

--- 帖子 #832 ---
I am glad if you find it usefull. So anyone found maybe som other pair or diferent block size more efective? Share you results. I made some tests as well. 1) EUR/JPY , 200 pips bars, paterns GR RG with 500sma on a 1H chart. It is same like the second method in post 826 I wrote, just 200 pips bars. TP 200, SL 200/300. Using 300 pip stop is worth I think becose it gives only one consecutive loss and allmoust same drowdown, with same stop loss as tp it is 2 losses in a row in 2009. I even consider to use it with d`alembert money management. 2)GBP/JPY GG RR paterns with 250 bars it is same as the first method menthioned in the post 826, just the size of the bar and 600sma.TP/SL- 250 One problem with price change chart indicator. If to use 200 or 250 bars it drows them wrong. It should start drowing bars from for example such round number as 1.5000 and up or down every 200/250 pips. But it drows them from 1.5100 instead, so it gives wrong visual view ,if you want to check it on the chart. The posibility is to drow them manualy. Anyway someone with programing skills would really be helpfull to fix it

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Hi, Thanks for the EA. Very appreciated. So, if I understand it correctly, the EA works for trading demo and live, but sometimes it doesn't take trades according to the pattern? In that case, do you know when and why the EA doesn't take the trades? Archie

--- 帖子 #834 ---
It works ok, just it can be that it will not take the first patern that will form. It works, do not worry to much. I use it on live account. Just be sure to set the right settings.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hi, In the settings for the GR/RG patterns, don't you mean buy RG and sell GR? Archie

--- 帖子 #836 ---
It has to be oposite becose the EA has reverse function, it can look like it is wrong, just the EA will do the oposite and it will work as has to.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
I am trying to use both indicators. As you can see in my charts I have "some" problems : When using 4 digits brokers : lines (NPipLines) are not always at the 00/50 levels . Sometimes 1 pips difference... the PriceChangeChart1 , not always draws exactly at the 00/50 also , sometimes there is a lttle gap . When using 5 digits brokers : nPipLines is completely drawing wrong lines (I change the settings to 1000&amp;500). Looking forward to get some help Tks

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Use this indicator for the lines I found resently The price change chart is a `bug indicator` it needs some programmer help. A few pips is not a problem but on GBP/JPY chart it drows 100 pips wrong if to use 200/250 bars.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Hi Saint As always , Thank You for your prompt answer. This indicator looks great ! Good for 4/5 digits Can display only 00 levels Tks for sharing your knowledge Tks for your patience David

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Saintsurfer, What difference in profitability have you experienced with the RG/GR in terms of using SL 100 instead of 150? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #841 ---
You can test and see , but for the gbp/usd it is not worth trading with 100 pips sl, results are poor. But it is quite good with 150. So it works. But for the eur/jpy with 200 pips box size it is not sush big diference, just less consecutive losses(only one in a row in 2009) And if to use it with d`alembert function it is worth to use 300 sl. But if someone asked me witch patern and pair is best of all, I would point GBP/JPY with 250 tp/sl GG,RR , only two consecutive losses in a row in 2009 and good results. But I will use them all for some kind of diversification.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Thanks for your fast answer, as always ! I am testing and trying out different pairs as well, but haven't quite got the reliability that I am looking for in testing. I tried EURUSD, and it seems that 25-50 will work ok, but I need to test more. I will try the GBP/JPY as well. Great that you keep this thread alive. Good work! Archie

--- 帖子 #843 ---
It`s good that you are testing, I see forward for some results out of it

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hey Saintsurfer, Great to see you put an ea together based on this thread. I tried to run a back test this weekend, but under the journal tab found the ea was looking for a ma_angle indi so it wasn't taking any trades for me. Can you post that indicator here? Is that the only custom indicator the ea needs to work? Or do you always turn the indis to false? Thank you for posting the ea.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
The only indicator I use is sma filter. Or what I find most easy to use. That slope filter seems hard to get any positive impact.There is no need to have any custom indicator , it is just the angle of moving average is used here.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
A new RG patern can be formed soon, anyone on trigger?

--- 帖子 #847 ---
My buy set-up has was trigered some moment ago...patiently waiting to see result

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hi, Mine was triggered as well. So far negative, since I have spread of 4 pips..... Keeping fingers crossed! Good luck to you!

--- 帖子 #849 ---
thanks , Kind of bad broker you use hm. have you used the EA for it or just manual?

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Ha ha, yes spreads for the GU are not the best. I'm thinking of changing, but so far I'm sticking to them. No, the didn't go off , so I put it on manually.... I will monitor both EA and trade manually to see the difference, when I have the time. Now, just must have had your trade triggered as well, with better spreads I hope

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Anyone on the RR pattern now?, RG pattern ended with a loss but Im on the RR pattern now....lets see how it turns out

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Hi, Yes I have a trade opened for that pattern. Evaluating the difference between 50 and 100 pip bars at the moment. Also, has anyone had any success with the EA. It doesn't take any trades for me. Archie

--- 帖子 #853 ---
The RR pattern works for me today . Am i alone with 50 pips bars ?? I've changed a little my rules, my filter is 5 sma (daily) and i play only RR and GG.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
No, I am looking at 50 pips as well, but with 500 SMA filter (30M). But do you always trade until the trade is over, that is following multiple RR patterns? It seems good, but may also cause more BE trades. Btw, does anyone know how to apply a setting or indi to see the MA value (price) on the screen? Archie

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Did u do any quick backtest on the 50pips bar using 500sma as filter on 30min...sounds like a good idea...and do u consider the counter trend patterns too? i mean the GR or RG patterns

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Well, I haven't quite got the backtest to work with the EA as I want to, still working on good results. However the results with C-speeds tester gives the following results from 1st Octobeer 1999 to 14th December 2009: 50 pips: 15 750 pips 100 pips: 5700 pips Have you done any backtests with difference in profitability between 50 and 100 pips or other sizes?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Personnally, when there are multiple pattern, (RRRRRR), i take them all. But i don't trade GR or RG.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Hi, I did a test for the same period as above only taking the RR/GG patterns after a change in trend, that is GRR or RGG. The results were: 50 pips: 8050 pips 100 pips: 3400 pips

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Yes, I think that RR and GG patterns are more stable, and I personally like the better RR of 1:1, even though the RG/GR can be profitable as well. In the long run I think that both 50 and 100 pips will be profitable, at least for now, but one always wonder which one that is going to be the long term winner Archie

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Why do you use the SMA 500 instead of the SMA 1000?

--- 帖子 #861 ---
I don't use SMA 500, i use SMA 5 I use it with daily chart. If Price is under SMA 5 ( now it is), i will not take GG patterns but only RR. I consider we are in a downtrend and i don't want to go against it. If price is above SMA 5 on my daily chart, i will take only GG patterns.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Yes I know, but SMA 5 on daily equals SMA 480 on 15M, if I'm not wrong, that was what I meant Which pairs do you use the system on?

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Its unbelievable!!! This sytem works very well... Im trying on G/U and G/J but want to know if there is another pair profitable too. Regards.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
First time in 4weeks im having 2consective losses with saint surfer method.....

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I trade only GBP/USD...

--- 帖子 #866 ---
I think any volatile pair works.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Thanks! I hope you don't mind me asking, but why have you chosen 50 pips instead of 100? Have you tested 100 pips as well, or do you think that it will be more profitable in the long run? Archie

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Hi Archie, The original method was with 50 pips bars. I prefer because there is twice more action than with 100 pips bars... I think yes, it will be more profitable in the long run, because there are more valid patterns. Today with 100 pips bars we would have GRR, if we play RR, we had one sell order triggered but no money in our pocket at this time. With 50 pips bars, i had GGRRRR today, i have played RR RR , so 2x50 pips=100 pips and one sell order which is not finished .

--- 帖子 #869 ---
You stop using martingale?

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Hi I did notice that a red brick was not displayed with the PriceChangeChart1 . Were supposed to be RRRR as Zebulon mentioned using 50 pips bricks . Any ideas why ? Zebulon , what chart do you prefer to look at , 15M , 30M ? Tks

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hi, I have noticed this as well, and for me it has happened when price has moved very fast. On my 15M chart the high was made by one bar, and in those situations the indicator doesn't work that well. I watched the 5M also, and it seems that the high was made in one bar there as well. I have the indicator as a helping tool, and most of the times it works well, but I prefer looking at the price action to see what is really going on. Archie

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Much movement, but not much results, at least positive. 4 losses in a row with both gbp/usd methods. Thats the hardest part. But should begin be better soon HA HA HA.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Yes, i'm using now something as d'alembert i have adapted : at each trade, i win or i loose 50 pips. I play first with 10.000 : If i loose, i play next with 12.000, if i loose again, 14.000. Then if i win, i play with 13.000, if i win again i play with 12.000. Each time i loose, + 2.000 Each time i win, -1.000 untill i reach my top score, then reset to 10.000 Enjoy it

--- 帖子 #874 ---
I prefer 15M chart, except to watch SMA 5 on daily chart.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Zebulon, What is your 'top acore'? Archie

--- 帖子 #876 ---
I mean the higher value of my account...

--- 帖子 #877 ---
do u use zebulon method of 5sma on daily too...though i had losses with 100pips bar this week..im still sticking with it...

--- 帖子 #878 ---
I use same chart, you know with 1000sma on 15min or 500 on 30 min GBP/USD. Yes, it is nessesary to be disciplined and patient, few losses is nothing it can even be worse sometimes. So heads up it will also be better I am sure.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Hi Saintsurfer, Have you had any success with the EA so far? I have tried it, but it doesn't place any trades at all, and I don't get any error messages, so I cannot figure out what's wrong with it. Appreciate any help. Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Hi Archie, It plases trades for me if the platform run all the time without interuption. It can be becose the ea has to be turn on while the patern is developing from the start so it recognises it and place a trade, thats may gess. A VPS server is good idea. I use one. And sure it maybe can be solved by a programer . I will probably contact the programer that developed it, maybe he can repair a little bit.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Yes, I tried running it on a VPS, but still no action. Do you set all time options to false? Archie

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Yes I do. It is also in the example setings in the post the ea is.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Anyone initiated the trades or waiting for confirming the trend?

--- 帖子 #884 ---
There was one trade that finished today from last week(RG patern on G/U). No new trades right to be triggered soon at least with my methods. Zebulons paterns on 50 pips may be giving more signals if someone is very unpatient

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Im not trying RG and GR paterns. Only GG or RR on the trend. Using the last method of Zebulon, with SMA 5. But now im using SMA 480 on 15min and SMA 240 on 30min, that is the same.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
The GG-pattern has formed, but price is still below SMA, so no trade for me. Archie

--- 帖子 #887 ---
What SMA are u using?

--- 帖子 #888 ---
SMA 1000 on 15M, though looking at SMA 500 as well, to compare them.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
For me the price was above SMA 5 (daily) today, so i went long 2 times. One trade was a loss, the second is still on .

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Saintsurfer &amp; Zebulon I have a question for both of you regarding the SMA. In Saintsurfer's strategy the SMA is set to 10 SMA on the daily TF (or 1000 on 15M), and Zebulon's strategy uses 5 SMA on daily. Right now, using the smaller SMA would have given a win on 50 pip bars, and perhaps soon a winning trade on 100 pip bars. Of course it's clear that the larger SMA is suitable for a larger bars, but sometimes it can be a bit slow, like now (providing that the current price reaches 1,5100 ) What is your input on the choice of SMA?

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Changing rules too often just heart the system.In some periods one sma work better another work worse, but if to change rules in this way it is just fitting to the market. If I knew statisticaly prooved that it would increase profitability adapting the filter for diferent periods I would do it. But didn`t find that advantage yet.Statistics say that it works better with these certain settings and I stik to it. While it works at least.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
SMA 480 on 15min working very well.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Do not take any atention to this ea, it is the same ea I posted earlear, just it has the right copyright. Thanks Sangmane and sorry. S.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
zebulon are you still using the rules you have postet on post 1?

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Now,i trade only GG and RR with GBP/USD 50 pips : if i have 2 previous green, i go long, if i have 2 previous red, i go short. i use the 5 SMA filter : if the price is above the 10 SMA (TF daily), i only go long and not play the RR. If the price is under the 10 SMA, i only go short and not play the GG. For the money management i use, you can go to post 873

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Hi Zebulon, First of all congrats for your system, it seems to me very efficient. But I am having some difficults to determine how is the right 50 pips movement I must consider. Would you please help me with that ? Below I will describe my doubts: 1- when do I start mesuring it ? I mean, do I take the Highest High against the Lowest Low and vice-versa? 2- if there is a 50 pips movement and soon after there is a small retracement correction and a new movement begins, For the new 50 pips movement do I consider the retracement correction highest high or Lowest Low or I start mesuring from the end of the previous 50 pips movement ? I hope I could make myself clear, since I am from Brazil and English is not my first language. Thank you very much for your help

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Hi Saintsurfer, I tried to test your 100@50 with the Meta 4 Strategy examiner tester and nothing happened, Would you know why ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Try to use settings you can find in post 826

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Saintsurfer, I have been doing some tests regarding the use of MA period. Actually this test perhaps seems pretty useless , but testing is always good for improvement. Perhaps the results are mostly random, but well well... I would appreciate your input and comparison of results. Looking at the results, I think that 5, 7 or 10 would be best. I would gladly test the difference between SMA and EMA as well, but I am not that good at re-coding the EA for that purpose. TP/SL/Range - 100 pips Pattern - GG &amp; RR Time: 5 Jan 2009 - 2 April 2010 SMA period: Pips; winning % 1: 1660; 56,69% 2: 2840; 60,00% 3: 2750; 59,86% 4: 2940; 60,87% 5: 3150; 62,50% 6: 2850; 61,79% 7: 2950; 62,71% 8: 2550; 61,61% 9: 2360; 61,54% 10: 2760; 63,46% Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Tudo bem ? Each time the price reach a round level, i draw a bar. I hope this chart will explain...

--- 帖子 #901 ---
what time frame you tested it on, Daily??? MA mode,- O stands for sma and 1 stands for ema if you need diferent kind of moving average.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Yes, it was tested on daily, so 10 SMA equals almost 1000 SMA on 15M, which is what I use. I will do some testing for the EMA as well. Since this is more of a long term slow system, perhaps the SMA is better, but we will see. Archie

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Actually I am desided only to trade GG and RR paterns for gbp/usd 100 pips and gpp/jpy 250 pips bars. Just it doesn`t mean that GR RG doesen`t work anymore. But I always was trend lover and resently got a little bit influensed once more only to trade with the trend, so will keep with it.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
I think this RenkoRangeBars chart could be useful for you. This is 50 pip chart without wicks. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
That`s great we will not need that strange `prise change chart` indicator anymore. Thank you very much for the link

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Thanks Zebulon , the chart helped a lot

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hi guys. You are doing a lot of good work here keep on I did some backtest with Saintsurfer"s method with some modifications. I use 300 SMA on 4H TF as a filter and only take a GG &amp; RR pattern in trend direction (price below/above SMA) TP &amp; SL is 100 pips. I ve been testing on 4h chart because I tried to make so much trades as possible and I dont have an older data in my MT4 so you should be careful there because the boxes in PriceChangeChart1 indicator sometimes arent drawn correctly( for example bigger pin bar crossing two round numbers won"t draw a box and if you are just looking at the chart and searching for possible profits(3xGGG) there can be mistake, only GG there but profit is hidden in that pinbar so rather check it on 1H timeframe) -hope you understand The data which I d tested are about 1-2 years old...dont know exactly There is a result : EURUSD - 3600 pips (96 trades) GBPUSD - 2700 pips (127 trades) EURGBP - 700 pips (96 trades) - trading with 50 pip box GBPJPY - 1000 pips (46 trades) - not full backtest just few trades EURJPY - 1700 pips (135 trades) USDJPY - 1800 pips (94 trades) AUDUSD - 1000 pips (68 trades) I tried to look at EURJPY and GBPJPY and consider to trade a 200 pip box but I didnt like it at all so I tried 100. This strategy seems to be simple and logical - price will rally a 200 pip move(2 boxes) in overall trend through ps.levels and we are awaiting for 100 others pips. It should be trade with smaller lot size than your usual if you want to trade these pairs together...because in range it hasnt a good results...I had max. 6 losses in a row - 600 pips...maybe a deeper backtest would say more I havent tried the other pattern which saintsurfer mentioned here with 150 pip SL, so if somebody would do it I will be pleased Mike

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Good tool for drowing the candles, but mooving average can not be used same as on usual chart hm. 10 sma looks to be simmilar to what 500 on 30 min chart, it even gives sense to use ema instead of sma or smaller average. I will behold both charts for now to be more clear.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Funny enuff , i jst seem to be more comfortable with sainsurfer's method of the 100pip bar than the 50pip bar of zubulon's...maybe its just me...

U can't compare ma on renko with one on TF based chart, since renko is timeless. Lubo.

No doubt about it. Just need to find now the settings that is closest to we use on candle chart.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Hello, i cant see the renko chart ... can you help me please ( file is in "indicator" but nothing happened ! ) Thx for your answer

--- 帖子 #913 ---
It's not an indicator but an EA, u must put it on expert folder, then u apply it on 1 min chart and open a 2 min offline chart, it starts only on market opened cos need live ticks. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
It is good that you are testing, but it dosen`t give better results with bigger moving average. And I don`t know how you get these results. good luck.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
You can post a resume of all trading methods here: Zebulon: RR &amp; GG patterns. Trading RR only if the price is below of SMA 5 on Daily TF, and GG above. Archie: Only GG &amp; RR patterns. TP &amp; SL of 100 pips. SMA 1000 on 15min TF. Saintsurfer: 100 Pips on GU and 250 GJ.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Saintsurfer, Have you tested any other RR, such as 2:1? I think that increasing the RR is quite crucial, but I have tried testing with the EA, but it seems that it's hard to go under TP/SL 100 on GU, and TP 200 seems to high. I got the following, increasing the TP for less than 2:1, but still higher (the best results I got). Perhaps does not seem like it is worth changing.... GBPUSD (TP/SL/Range) 150/100/100 - 1940 pips, 48% winning trades, 5 consecutive wins, 8 consecutive losses 100/100/100 - 2460 pips, 62% winning trades, 6 consecutive wins, 6 consecutive losses GBPJPY (TP/SL/Range) 250/150/250 - 2210 pips, 50% winning trades, 3 consecutive wins, 3 consecutive losses 250/250/250 - 2070 pips, 60% winning trades, 4 consecutive wins, 3 consecutive losses Regards Archie

I have used the same as for GU, 15M with 1000 SMA. The period was from 5 Jan 2009 to 2 April 2010. Archie

--- 帖子 #919 ---
for gbp/jpy I use 600sma on 1H chart, or 1200 on 30min. I think it works better.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
My first g/j trade with 250 bars will be posibly trigered today to the short side when/if it goes as low as 140.0

--- 帖子 #921 ---
hey my trade finished with nice 250 pips loss, lets take it as it is

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Anyone trading anything with any methods in here or everybody is dead scared of losses I resently declared Actualy i mised the entry for gbp/usd 100 GG patern, but it even retraced to below normal entry so I could enter at more atractive price 30 pips below 1.5400. With better RR. But sure nothing is guarantied yet.

Hi, I am still trading it. I caught the last short trade on GU, which ended with a win on Monday. Currently I am in on the last long since Tuesday. It was at +72 at best, but now it's at -39, so I am waiting and hoping for the best. Regards Archie

Hi everyone! I have this EA -RenkoRangeBarsV1.2 as attached which is working absolutely fine. The only problem is, it cannot open or close a trade automatically. If it is GG, then it should execute a buy order. If it is RR, it should execute a sell order. If the candle size is 50 pips, then the take profit should be 50 pips and stop loss should be also 50 pips. Lot size will be 1 lot. Appreciate, if anyone could kindly help me on this. Maybe modify or edit a few scripts from the MetaEditor. Looking forward from you guys. Thank you. Regards, Michael

Been studying all posts on this thread and it is very confusing and I am not the brightest candle anyway. No pun intended. Can someone make one post with all the attachments needed? (just the ones that are working? EA, Indicators, etc. and briefly explain how and where to load.) I am a somewhat of a newcomer, but not totally new...been losing trades for awhile. p.s. please don't tell my wife I am still trading.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
dude, renkorangebar ea doesnt take any trades.. it is used to convert your regular bar charts into renko..

--- 帖子 #927 ---
well am dealing with 1H chart with 18 EA, and try to understand the Fibonacci Retracement 23.6 level and don't go for the market let the market come to you.. ..try to take 30 to 40 pips have fun am begninger too but its works

--- 帖子 #928 ---
how you will know that is the high and there was the low,, are you calculating by day , H, or mints?

--- 帖子 #929 ---
renko bars doesnt concerned with the time. it is PA(price action) that concerns the renko bars.. below is an example of a renko bars.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
OP says you need a pencil and paper. You don't even need that. Just look back on your chart and see what the last 2-3 50 pip swings were. Proceed where it left off.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
can't seem to get this to attach to my chart...I put it in experts/indicators folder then tried to attach...can anyone help? thanks jacob

--- 帖子 #932 ---
this file should go to your mt4/experts folder, not to the indicators folder!,then you open a 1M chart and attach this renko file to this chart,after that you must open a ofline M2 chart

--- 帖子 #933 ---
thanks sam...working now...testing 38 points also. i seem to get more opportunities. How do we setup an alert for this? br/jacob

--- 帖子 #934 ---
have done some stats work...take it with a grain of salt because I lose more than I win two scenarios with this system (thanks Zeb)...one using Zeb's 50 point suggestion and one using 38. I arrived at 38 just randomly as it came to my head, but I am sure there is a much more optimum number than 38 (maybe even 50) Stats for 50 points move: 1 candle only (with next candle reverse)...15 occurrences 2 candles (with third candle reverse).........8 occurrences greater than 2 candles............................6 occurrences Stats for 38 points move: 1 candle only (with next candle reverse)...29 occurrences 2 candles (with third candle reverse)........14 occurrences greater than 2 candles...........................12 occurrences stats are from mid-may. My goals are to achieve 10 pips per trade. At first glance, seems like it is breakeven all around. Maybe Zeb can chime in on how he is doing? Also, I cannot measure PA at the beginning of each new candle which can only increase the win percentage if stop losses are at 38 or 50 (w/o spread). Another thing is that some greater than 2 candles were three and four candles increasing pips if one holds the order open. I will continue to study this to achieve a better profit ratio.

Seems that GBP/JPY method using 250 pips bar size and GG, RR with 150-200 sma filter on 4H time frame is still working.Best with 200 sma filter. Ok a little bit boring trading style but stil profitable. This year seven trades five wins and two losses. 750 pips.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
In my thoughts (just me now), when trading becomes boring, it is best time to trade...when things are exciting, I seem to enter into too many bad trades. I have been testing UJ at 22 pips bars, and EJ/GJ at 38 pips bars. Live trading with this system will begin this week. I have spent the last week only watching the PA after a new bar has opened. Just about every time, the PA continues in the direction of the previously closed bar even if the new bar closes in the opposite direction. My goal is to achieve 5 pips only (at high lots) at each new bar opening in the same direction. It appears that one can obtain at least 10 trades per day using these three pairs.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
the best think is that it doesen`t take much time to trade this method, no need for the ea simply set pending orders and you will never miss a trade. The bad side is that it is hard to have a 250 pips SL and take such a loss at times, but it at least pays off so far.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
I may be open to say that I don`t understand how you trade with this method...

--- 帖子 #939 ---
My method is different from the main in the first post but also similar. I downloaded in Renko version 1.2 ex4 file on one of the posts. then i applied it to M1's for UJ, EJ, GJ, then opened M2 offline charts for each and watch the bars. try it out and always watch the direction of the PA after each bar closes. I am not one for looking for large pip gains...just small ones at higher lots. if you need help, just PM me. Jacob

--- 帖子 #940 ---
ok I see a little bit more now. Anyway I am not a scalper so maybe not for me. Anyway good luck.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
it is not really a scalping system like on m1 or m2 with many daily trades. it is more of a short term for maybe a few trades per day for each pair. i dont have to watch the charts every second, just when each new bar opens and when a bar is coming to a close I pay close attention to the PA on the m1 chart

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Is anyone still following this thread? i'm only half way through it but I was wondering if anyone could help. I have downloaded the PriceChangeR.mq4 indicator but was wondering if anyone could possibly modify this indicator to run off of the begining of the week candle. Maybe have the option of changing begining of the month, week, etc. candle? thanks irrumate

--- 帖子 #802 ---
hi zebu is your original method on page 1 still working ok ? Is it still profitable ? I believe you have updated now ? Can you post the final version of it with updates ?? This would be really helpful. Lastly the problem iam having is when to start counting the 50 pips and draw the first 50 pip candle, because depending on where i start could effect the results. So can you help ? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #803 ---
hi zebulon, I know your system is on cable, but can we try it on eurusd?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Dear All, I have followed this interesting thread for a few days. The only thing that I have not figured out is the calculation of 50pips. Assume that the open price is 1.6354, and the price reached 1.6304=1.6354-0.005, then I marked "RED". And should I use 1.6304 as the basis price of next calculation ? or use the open price of next bar as basis price ? Thanks for your kindly reply.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
how can you be sure that you can got the 50 pips from the market? and how can you calculat that? Can you teach me how? from what I have got fromt he readings that it can be calculated with Fibonacci.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Hello C-speed, It seems the strategy tester web site has some technical issues. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hi Zebulon, are you calculating the high and low of candle to get 50pips or just the body minus wick. nowadays 30mins 1hr or 4hr difficult to get 50pips candle that is if i just take into account of body. Adious....

--- 帖子 #808 ---
hi, yes i take the high and the low of the candle. Each time the price touch 00 or 50 i draw a candle.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
aaahh....zebulon,,,finally after all these years !! This system does not make pips in the long run. I backtested for 2 years and live tested for 6 months. Back to square one. Can you comment and how well you are doing ????

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Hi... 50pips hardly occurs once in a blue moon nowdays in 1hr chart... hard to find.... any idea?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
I use 15 min chart

--- 帖子 #812 ---
That is a system which brings new ideas, but it needs more to be performant. I'm working on another system based on this one, maybe i will talk about it when it will be finished.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
why y guys dont use 50pip rangebars?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
well you could most of the time if you have goodo strategy.. for me am doing + or -.. 20 pips to 38 a chart.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
what happened to all your other strategies . are those not working either ? have you actually made any money using any of your strategies ? reply please. no point in working on a new strategy if the others havent worked...

--- 帖子 #816 ---
whatfx, do you use strategy tester in mt4 for backtesting? or other method..
