thought i would share this one, try to avoid ranging markets. hopefully the template speaks for itself but if anyone needs further guidance i can put some more detail in, screenshots of trades shown, works best on jpy pairs. have fun

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Hi djms Although I don't scalp the market, the indicator on your chart that shows the news release is interesting, where can I find it? Thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
its all in the rar file buddy

--- 帖子 #4 ---
my last trades on gbp/jpy, every red cross is an entry cause uptrend is identified by the macd and the moving average

--- 帖子 #5 ---
ej's trades today, 9-0 just blindly trading pullbacks to the tma channel on that uptrend, exit when price breaks/hits upper band. 92 points in total taking away spread. would be much more if i trailed so if anyone has any other ideas for exits would be good to know.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
nzd/jpy, take the white crosses when the trend is down then red ones when trend is up, too many winners on this chart to count.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
recent action on cad/jpy.....

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi djms, Thanks for your indicators. I have a question ; You said take the white crosses for shorts and red crosses for longs, does the indicator place those crosses or you just marked the trades that you had taken? If the indicator marks them do they repaint? tnx

--- 帖子 #9 ---
congratulations DJMS. All I can say you did a great job. I trade something similar......very close. Nice thing is that there is little draw down, the profits are good. This too can be traded on any time frame.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
hello hibra and welcome, the tma bands will alert you when the band is touched then the cross forms when an opposing candle appears. the tma bands might repaint a little after time but you should take the trade when the price breaks the band then forms a candle in your trade direction, dont take engulfing candles, small ones are good because you want the best possible strike rate. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #11 ---
haha thanks, only took me 4 years to get here but hey ho. yeh can be used on any timeframe - the higher the timeframe the larger the stop loss should be used. also you can switch to the 1 hr and in an uptrend if price is touching lower bands switch to the 1min then hit every pullback to the bands in the upward move. you can also use the crosses to place your horizontal sr, when price breaks up for example place a line on the white cross of the last high then look for retraces back to it combined with a break of bands.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
macd can also be used to catch divergance - this was some at a daily pivot level giving you more confidence to hit the pullbacks when it went long. dont trade divergance alone you still need to wait for price to cross the ma and macd to change before entering.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
divergances at whole numbers can often be a sign of market turn so wait patiently for price to break through the ma then wait again for the retrace, i like this template because it forces the trader to be disciplined reduces the emotional trades that we all take. if your set up dont work, don;t sweat it wait patiently again for the next one, i monitor 6 jpy pairs so there are plenty of opportunities in the day. sit back relax and wait for your next tma alert

--- 帖子 #14 ---
eur/aud - kinda no brainer, stops need to be slightly more on this girl due to its higher volatility thats why i dont trade it

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank you for sharing D but run into some problems... tma band does not load for me...and what are the parameters of the t3 ma...it s set to 13 but that s too fast

--- 帖子 #16 ---
hmm, make sure you have the most recent build of mt4? attached again sorry i dont have the mq4 file. t3 period is 240 which is basically a 200 ma but not quite.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
How long you have been using this strategy for? Any suggestion on the TP and SL? Thanks

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hmm trading trendlines and sr trading for bout 2 years, this template simplifies the process a bit more - id say its the hottest scalping strat there is cause your waiting on retraces in the current momentum, anyone already downloaded can see this from last nights asian session sl 10-15 the trick is to get it as tight as possible but still avoid whipsaws, take profit when price hits opposite band or if price comes to lower band in uptrend the 1hr chart you could think about trailing your positions or close part of your position on first break of bands then pull your stop to break even then close some again if it breaks outside bands again, not 100 percent sure about tp. gbp/jpy and all other asian pairs 2 hrs into the session we had sick moves

--- 帖子 #19 ---
thanks for sharing can used it in any timefram or just 1 minn

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Nice. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Djms, Thanks for the generosity in giving the strategy... May i ask, is there any need for Supply and Demand Zones and Pivot/Resistance.... I mean, can one trade just using the TMA band, Moving Average and Macd ignoring the other add-ons? Thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Does the Tma repaint ?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Yes. Repaint or recalculate. Whatever you wanna call it these days. D.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Any recommended market session to trade your method? Do you care about news?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
yes one can do what one wishes you dont need the supply/demand indi.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
as i trade only jpy then best session for me is asian, 1-2 hrs after it opens sees nice volume. any other normal trading day as well - just try to avoid choppy markets and keep switching to higher time frames, if the price is hanging out of bands on higher time frame be careful trading continuation as price likes to find its way back to middle of bands. not every trade will be a winner as the trend changes obviously so the best trades are the first signals you get when the price crosses if that makes sense below screenshot aud/jpy do not take this long as you already had about 10 trades up and price is hanging out bands on higher time frames so sit on hands at this time

--- 帖子 #27 ---
djms , good thread bro if we use m5 , and m15 time frime , how much possibilty average tp we should take? Thx bro

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks Djms. You mention about the bands repainting a bit, but The crosses, do they repaint?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
or not haha, still made its target, i guess just keep hitting it until you burn then look for opposite direction, this shows another example where you can stack up your points fast by opening multiple positions turning a 5 point move into a 20 point move

--- 帖子 #30 ---
you can adjust the bands yourself to find the best setting, i think this one works best, only take candles that hang out the bands and give cross straight away forget about the ones that might appear afterwards when the bands repaints a little.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Red and white crosses are repained with the main TMA band. They just disappear when band changes, so do not look at this beautiful charts backwards. Do you average your position or use hard SL for every single cross (trade)? And what is SL 10-15 SL for you? I have 6-12 spread on my ECN for USD/JPY. Maybe you mean 100-150 SL for 5 digits brokers?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
valid trade set up here so just hit it then when price reaches the upper band close the position , in this case you might have broken even, close trade anyways and look for next set up

--- 帖子 #33 ---
an example here of when to stop stacking trades, some red crosses appear when price is under ma and macd is red. dont over trade

--- 帖子 #34 ---
example here when we have all valid signals, the bands did not repaint , each pop outside the upper band resulted in winning trades. at this point we got high impact news in 10 mins so time to make a coffee and talk to cat

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Djms, So this is what i understand; Wait for the candle to breach{ideal is to close} beyond the candle. The candle opposite to the momentum will trigger a cross.As long as the opposite candle is forming, the cross may disappear/repaint as it is still in play. Once the opposite candle is closed/cross we enter. Is this correct? Thanks

--- 帖子 #36 ---
with a 6-12 tick spread on usdjpy then its either time to find a new broker or look to trade this template on a higher time frame? i use hard stops. gbpjpy is my most volatile pair so i;ll sometimes adjust that to 15 points but no more. if you take a hit just wait for next set up.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks for the anwer. What spread do you have or reccommend for m1 trading? Is your account spread+commission?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
example here of stacking and holding, 10 valid set ups. average length of move 70 points. 700 points in 1 hr hmmmm

--- 帖子 #39 ---
my spread is 1.2 just now for uj, only jumps up above 2 when market opens after the weekend, there;s no commission i dont think haha - pretty sure its only spread

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I think we missunderstood each other. 1.2 means 12 I think Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
thanks you exit when the price hits/closes on opposite band, same exit applies to all timeframes, tp is what the market gives you at the time.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hey djms, Thanks for sharing. Hope you don't mind the post of a slightly modified chart. Just a personal preference to see divergence at OS/OB. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Djms, Is 10 minutes before high impact news your cut off time?Do you stop trading for medium impact news? How long after the news event do you start trading? Thanks PS: Does getting a cat help?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
DIMS, thanks for sharing. Would you have source code for TMA+CG mladen??

the problem is that there is never a red cross with macd green and vive verca

--- 帖子 #45 ---
u can trade the news if you want generally the news just pushes the trend faster, trade at your own risk and remember to increase your stops for news cause u get whipsaws cat optional

--- 帖子 #46 ---
this is an example of where i might be tempted to hold this trade cause if you check the 1hr chart its a signal to go short there on a down trending market

--- 帖子 #47 ---
this is true so i just wait in these moments, chances are the market is ranging a bit so time to make coffee or check out other assets for set ups. if you trade an asset with higher volatility like euraud or gbpaud remember to increase your stop size

--- 帖子 #48 ---
thanks for the tip. yeah, i saw that. heavy news made me want to just get out quick. although, in hindsight, would have been the right move. got in a little late but worked out Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ First Question; Are you a DJ??? Next; On chart below from pg 2, #32, You call this a valid trade. Based on what you have written, previous to this, and my interpretation, I would have not taken this trade for the following two reasons: • X's form below TMA. &amp; • MacD turns red during set up. I do really like the fact that this trade plan is much more 'Objective', then 'Subjective', which helps keep my personal moron in check. Would you state your opinion on why you liked this set up please? Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #50 ---
DJMS, please address your experience regarding the repaint properties of "TMA+CG mladen" One does not know that the bands are going to repaint until it is too late. As far as visual back test goes, you cannot have a lot of confidence in the visual because many loosing signals have repainted and you do not see them on the chart. Not trying to go negative here -- your strategy is interesting. Just need to get comfortable with this issue. A few years ago, I spent a lot of effort with TMA (back in tha Allorente days) and gave up on it, maybe because of my lack of experience at the time, and maybe not. Or thoughts please.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
What about using TMA True?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
i uses to dj yeh now i just make music i saw that as valid cause price was above ma and macd was still green.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
hmm i dunno buddy - just take the first signal that comes and and forget about any repainting later, you can use bollinger bands if you want - it doesnt repaint

--- 帖子 #54 ---
if you guys could post some loosing trades as well we could look further into them

Nice charts DJMS. Keep it up. I notice that a lot of forex traders don't like or do not have the time the watch the charts because they have to work or because it is hard waiting and waiting for a trade !!1!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Yes and it looks like the red crosses are below the last pullback. Would you take those pullbacks? I mean do you take a pullback if it's below the last pullback in an uptrend?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
If the crosses repaint than maybe we should only consider taking trades that touch Sr or pivots.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
hi,djms . Can you tell me the specific usage of this indicator and how many cycles it uses?. I usually do my hour line, four hours daily, the long-term trend, the index of MACD can be determined by departure from top to bottom, and then waiting for a break up (down), and then traded. MACD determine the trend, the disk resistance line to determine a single point, so understand, right, please point out. Thank you

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thank you dj for sharing.....

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Dj again tnx fit the template so far it's the best scalping template that I came across. I have another question. Do you take every cross as a trade. Meaning do you enter a new trade for each cross that appear o e after the other? If you do, what position size do you use. Tnx

--- 帖子 #66 ---
thanks for your kind words and no problem, its the best scalping template i ever say as well and ive been through pretty much most of them the beauty of it is that you get the best strike rate for trend continuation, takes out the emotion as well so no chance for revenge trading or god complex trading hmm good question im cautious about hitting pullbacks in trends that are overextended and oversold. you can use an rsi to filter but clear to see with eyes. the best trades are the ones where the price makes its first cross of the ma and comes back into it if that helps any. as for position size just use what size you feel is relevant to your account.....

--- 帖子 #67 ---
an example of when to stop hitting the red crosses can be seen here - u already got shed loads of long entries, price is overextended so your taking too much risk hitting red crosses near the top there, time to sit on hands ans wait patiently to see what happens.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Alright bro tnx

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Dj Is there a way to add push notification (I use my phone for taking trades). Push notification for crosses (for entry) than a separate sound for touching the band (for take profit). Of course I might be able get someone to create an ea (I don't know your thoughts on this) Tnx

--- 帖子 #70 ---
sorry i dont know about notifications, maybe some other members can help you there. an EA would be interesting. i guess you could just use the ma and the bands? pm me if you think about taking it forward

--- 帖子 #71 ---
OK I will

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi... thanks for sharing this strategy... i checked with strategy tester, and many signal is repaint... so you must understand the basic trading, and management risk with this strategy and some signal disappear when goes wrong direction my opinion is: dont trade when ranging, trade only when trending, the white line is above or below T3, to minimaze false signal but this is a good strategy, because i fans of indicator made by mladen

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi DJMS. Thankyou for your trading system. Looks promising. Subscribed &amp; look forward to testing it. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Santoso777, Thanks for taking the time for checking with strategy tester... Could you please expand more on your statement: "the white line is above or below T3"

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I think he ment only take long when lower band line is above t3 ma. Opposite for shorts

--- 帖子 #76 ---
TMA had long been labeled as a repainter when actually it recalculated on new data. When price pushes the bands higher or lower, the bands recalculate on new data. Mladen has discussed this in great length.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
hello thirdpillar, do you mind posting your rsx divergence indicator? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #78 ---
TMA True is supposed to be a non-repainting version of TMA.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
That is exactly what repainting is. Re-calculating previously closed bars.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
welcome new traders yes the tma bands repaint but there are still plenty of signals that don't, these are the ones you look at. if anyone has any other suggestions or ideas as to what can be used instead of tma bands to catch pullbacks then please let us know........

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I think we can use true tma. Same signals in real time but without repainted past signals.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Fellows stop complaining about repainting issue please, look for your odds live testing price behavior ... look for correlations with pivots, S/R , S/D and trend... system works very nice in consolidations, but if price is fast rising up or falling down don't take nothing against, just look for pulback and go with trend direction... this is not a rocket science Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi, I am very new to trading, I am trying to download this scalping tool to the meta4, it does not seem to work. Can someone direct me how to download this tool? Thanks. Abdul

--- 帖子 #72 ---
djms, in post 5, you have an E/J chart on which you mention a 9-0 win rate. You can not do a visual back-test on a TMA chart, because the signals re-paint AFTER you take the trade. You cannot pick signals that do not re-paint because you do not know of the re-paint until it is too late. The only way to evaluate this system is to forward test and keep statistics. Do you have long-term forward test data? That would be interesting. Re-paint is most significant in consolidation or during periods of direction change. Trading the center of a long trend might be a good strategy, because re-painting is less significant. Problem is you get few pullbacks to the TMA entry band. Maybe trade pullbacks to the center line during a long trend -- you get lots of them. Been doing this for 10 years. For you guys who think you can ignore re-paint, you will learn in time to hate re-painters.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
You are correct -- it is not rocket science. It is more difficult.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
yes your correct - a few of those would have repainted - so in reality there would only have been 4-5 winners on that chart because it doesn't repaint the candles that hang out the bands. why is it a problem getting few pullbacks to the band? for me its no problem i don;t mind waiting, perhaps you are impatient to trade, thoughts like that will burn your account. If you've been doing this for 10 years perhaps you could enlighten us all with something better to use than the tma.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
no point at all, perhaps you should move to another thread

--- 帖子 #76 ---
My dear friend, there is no doubt ZigZag strongly repaint... so is useless from your point of view. I earn on that nasty feature ... I don't need those dosts or crosses, I am looking for weakness and strength, and TMA's helps me to confirm weakness or strength. Same manner we can use BB with dev3.3.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
the download should appear in your browser - you need to have winrar installed to unzip it then put all files in relevant places, youtube will help you if you get stuck there.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
ok - what do you think guys - should i pull down this strat and move on to another thread or should i ban this metta person from making more useless comments.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
as you wish, thats your thread bro !

--- 帖子 #80 ---
being agressive about repainting indicators will simply not help anyone...there will be always existing those indicators ...this one is showing the very actual entry moment or exit moment....the past can be forgotten and re-calculated...you traders are scalping with this system, at least trying to scalp. If anyone has a better indicator with same function and never repainting, just attache it here and show your positive share...."what is the point" question will not improve this system. The Author here shares something whats work for him and try to also improve it, just we all need to see this point.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I trade my own system -- very different from this, but quite similar to CigarGuy's thread. I have time to follow the various threads, and because I spent so much effort with TMA a few years ago, I read your thread. There are few good alternatives to TMA. TMA looks so enticing on the screen because it does such a great job of smoothing the curve fit. Overlay TMAtrue on the same chart and you will see all the smoothing that TMA does. Unfortunately, it does the smoothing after you have made your entry. I mean you no ill will, and wish your thread well. My thought would be to filter the turning points, and take signals during the middle of significant trends. I learned to program mql during my 10 year journey. I wrote an indicator that integrates various signals from your strategy and attempts to filter the change in direction.. 1. T3_Slope_Enable simple shows the slope of the T3 curve. 2. TMA_X_T3_Enable attempts to filter out the turn areas of TMA. The signal is long when the Lower TMA Band is above T3. The signal is short when the Upper TMA Band is below T3. 3. CG_Signals_Enable gives a long signal when an "X" occurs near the Lower TMA Band and a Short signal when an "X" occurs near the Upper TMA Band. 4. MACD_ZC_Enable signals long when MACD is above zero and a short signal when MACD is less than zero. 5. Alerts provided, so you can turn off the TMA alerts and not go quite so crazy. 6. Some other stuff in ther that I have in all my signal generation indicators. You must have the indicator "TMA+CG mladen" in your indicators folder. Turn them on and off one at a time and your will get the idea. Can turn on any combination of them. The net signal is the logical "and" of the enabled signals. Ok. There you go "Buddy". Good luck with your thread.

First post on FF. This was a lot of fun to read as a new trader. Read every word of every post. My thanks to DJMS and everyone else who contributed to the conversation. Are traders getting so badly burned from repainting? Seems like a lot of disdain/mistrust of them. From what I gather from the author, this shouldn't be such a big deal in this thread as author is looking for immediate ques to enter/exit, not looking back to see if a trade will be right or wrong. Is this not an instinctual approach, thus negating the inaccuracy of repainting? Authors approach appears to be that of an athlete making quick decisions in a game that he is very used to and adept in, while the critics of the repainting in this strategy are like the coaches in the locker room going over video before the game; once the game starts, sometimes all of the planning in the world doesn't matter. But what do I know, I'm still trading paper . I plan to sit on the bench an watch this strategy for a while, maybe become an athlete in it one day. Very grateful to all of the generous voices in this conversation. I learned a lot!

I confirm that it's true, being rocket engineer

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks Ryder for the indicator. Quite useful in regards to this system

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Well, no ofence but if taking pullback is more difficult then rocket science, what kind of rocket you are dealing with?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
ryder - thank you for your contribution. i wish i knew a little mql myself its on my to do list i'll have a look at it this week......

--- 帖子 #95 ---
The people can build on the consistent base many different types of rocket, but they can't take pullbacks in the same manner

Edit: Before anyone wastes any time replying; I figured it out. I'll work harder before making any more bad posts. Sorry! Is anyone else getting constant requests to update FXR SR indicator .exe from first post of this thread? Even after I updated, it still isn't happy. I ended up deleting the indicator all together from my MT4 editor indicators folder, removed it from my dl's folder, emptied my recycle bin, and still asking for updates. Not sure where MT4 is sourcing this from now. I guess my greater question would be how to permanently delete indicators forever, not just off of a chart. Having a hard time finding info on this. Thanks to anyone who might reply.

Live testing the system despite the repainting issue, two short trades taken on GBPJPY and EURJPY. Attached two screenshots of each pair before and after the repaint, the entry exit are shown on the After images and were based on system's rules. Till now everything is working fine. Djms, Thanks for sharing it .

--- 帖子 #100 ---
and here goes another sell on both pairs before repaint. GJ closed before touching the lower band.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Good work djms

--- 帖子 #102 ---
DreamwalkeR, are you going for a 9 pip TP on most of these? Set up as TP or closed manually? Thanks! I've been watching this all night and am having fun with it. Taken a few decent trades too, but have been shooting for more than 9 pips. Then again, I did have to move to the M5. I've been watching this all night and am having fun with it. Taken a few decent trades.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hey, All closed manually as I wanted to see it dropping to lower band, wasn't targeting a specific number of pips. Note that the best entries comes after crossing T3.

Hello Djms How did you overcome the issue related to the TMA repainting? Thanks

--- 帖子 #123 ---
How many time frames up do you reference for trend direction? e.g. If you're looking at 5M, do you reference the 15M time frame or the 30M, or the 1H?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
i just wait for a good break outside the bands, these ones don't repaint - its really quite simple

--- 帖子 #125 ---
thanks. i was expecting to watch it and close if/when it hit the upper band. but i had to suddenly run out the door without setting a take profit. i just got back to see that although i missed the intended exit, i'm still in it. so i closed half and will let the other half go for the day. Attached Image (click to enlarge) that new template looks good

--- 帖子 #126 ---
DJMS, When you say "...these ones don't repaing.." are you referring to the TMATrue indicator? If so, I placed that on my chart, but I didn't get any "X" buy/sell indicators on my charts.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Djms, Appreciate the many examples. In the above trade, TMA band is above the Moving Average, but The Price is below the Moving Average. Can one take trades in such a scenario or does the price also has to be above MA in addition to TMA? Thanks

thank you for this fantastic indicator it does not repaint it is better than tma. but if both are joint togather,,,, wow. thank you

Hi DJ, looks like you don't have the macd anymore. Do you not care about it? Are you just taking crosses outside bands no matter what? tnx

--- 帖子 #135 ---
weee, now i got arrows and crosses on my chart, lucky meeee

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Samer, From what i observed, it is repainting/republishing. Some one else could confirm as well. Thanks

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I have my chart zoomed out, so I can see up to whole week on my M5 TF ... I am looking sometimes up to H1 , but often play against trend for 10 pips. Check D1 for important S/R levels ....

--- 帖子 #138 ---
the macd was swinging too much into green and red so now i just use 2 versions of the t3 clean, one at 240 and one at 50 if the one at 50 is under the 240 then the average of the price or current momentum is shorts and visa versa. sometimes the price can fly over the 240 but so long as the 50 is above or below it i use that to identify current momentum remember to switch to higher time frames cause u dont wanna be shorting a a trade on the 1min when the h1 is at support on an uptrend

--- 帖子 #139 ---
thank you so much everyone for contributing to the thread so far, my idea here was to simplify price action trading. everyone hears the saying buy low sell high but getting in is always the tricky part. At least now we have a simplistic trend following strat that may not be a winner every time but its obvious to see it has a high enough percentage to provide us with an edge that over time should be enough to beat the market and can be traded on all timeframes. I just choose the 1 min cause i can be at the charts all day. the template also helps with trading psychology (almost as important as strategy) we no longer have to think too much about getting in and there are no thoughts as where to get out, once you trade there;s no moving stop losses or worrying about what targets to take. In saying that though you can easy partial close your trade if trading with higher volume at the edge of the bands then lock in your stop - thats up to the trader...... lets keep rolling

How to test any indicator for repainting there are two different ways: either you set in front of your screen for hours to watch it or the real test is a proof by mql4 - simple expert any trader on mt4 can buld it from scratch ok lets do the following test open new chart for tf 5 min attach the indicator you want to test it for repainting into that chart. save the chart in the templates as "empty-ea" open mt4 mql4 editor open new expert pop up screen open new expert do not write anything inside it press next then next then next close the pop up screen now press save as ,,, write the new name exactly as the above suggested empty-ea save it go back to mt4 go to test strategy choose the file empty-ea now press start wow the tester will open the chart with the indi then make the speed of the test on 31 or 32 (max 0 then you can see that if the indi is repainting... this is valid for any indi in general unless the author made rejection for test in the code at which in most cases not found. enjoy - i have found that the fast ma called tma is repainting i found that the the ma bands NOT REPAINTING Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I'm not a coder or even close, but I thought this might be simple. I opened the indicator from post 1 TMA + CG mladen in mq4 format and replaced all the instances of tma with tmatrue. When I compiled it, I got a bunch of error messages. I am totally clueless with this stuff. Maybe someone more talented can take a look at this.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Looks like all pairs are riding the middle band of the true tma right now on the 5min chart. And the NZD have taken a nose dive. So all nzd pairs are out of the band but don't trade them.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi Hibra, I like your idea of using the combination. What are your settings for TrueTMA? My bands seem quite a bit wider than yours. I've got 0, 56, 3.0, 100, 0, false

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi, I'm using the original settings. here is the indi.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
how can i apply these downloads? and if you dont mind can you explain the strat of this juts in case i cant install the EA? I actually do use Bands and MacD and MA, but it seems like yours are set to different numbers to report info they way yours is showing. Its not just trading touches on regular 1M Bands right?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
If MA BBands don't repaint then we have the holy grail of indicators LOL. just put it on a chart and every ones a winner...has to be a repainter.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
guys stop going on about repaint, the holy grail dont exist as kraven said so do the best job with the best tools you can to get an edge. the bands are just flexible standard deviation bands and when price extends outside them it provides a trading opportunity but only with current momentum. 1 min charts can get choppy so keep track of other timeframes. if my yellow ma is under the green i take short if above then longs, retraces to bands with nice clean break needed then wait for your trend continuation candle to get in. if you dont need to use the ma's or the macd and just do PA then use the bands for pullbacks in where you think assets are going, simples. these 5 min charts show very clear entries that DID NOT REPAINT!!!!! if your concerned they repaint then adjust the bands to be wider and take less trades simples.....

--- 帖子 #134 ---
great work, thank for share it

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yes DJ, tnx I know they repaint its just someone said they don't. But it looks like the arrows don't repaint because I see a down arrow on top of another down arrow and vice versa for up arrows. So I really don't need the bands than. I can just trade the arrows with fibs. I will have to manual test it tnx

--- 帖子 #137 ---
good job kraven bb to the trash bin, back to tma. lol

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi there djms, I have added popup alerts for the MA_BBands and also changed the TMA+CG to place the arrows at the right place and show the period in the alert message. For both I added an option called "Front_to_chart". What it does is : when you have an alert, it will bring the chart to front of the others. So if you have, for example, 5 charts opened at full screen, the one that alerts will be brought to front. Any problem with them please tell me as I didnt have the time to test. EDIT.: reuploaded the TMA. forgot something in the code.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
brother ,how to draw this line t3? is this t3= tma? thx brother

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Indeed, this is a lot of screen staring. How long is a typical session for you with this strategy? I'm in a unique situation where I work the night shift (in US) and remote into my PC at home to trade and I was watching this for at least 7 hours waiting for opportunities. Are you spending this much time watching? Also, adding the 50 T3 is brilliant. I'm very happy I found this thread as a new trader. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #141 ---

Djms, Could you please attach the template of the above. Much appreciated Djms. Thanks

aaven, On your chart just add (2) T3 Clean indicators. On inputs tab make sure T3 period value is set to 50 for yellow and then modify the other on the chart for a period of 240 for green.

Is it possible to replace TMA with TMAtrue in your indicator?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
easy trades on pound yen today

--- 帖子 #161 ---
have a look if that one works for you, had it in my indi list

--- 帖子 #162 ---
sorry. didnt get the ideia. what do you mean by replace ? my indicator ? none of them are mine.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I thought you made a change to the original indicator. I was wondering if TMA could be replaced with TMAtrue in the indicator. That would solve the whole repainting issue and we would still get the crosses. I don't know how to do it, so I thought maybe you could take a look at it.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
So what you want is a TMA true indicator with arrows and alerts ? is that it ? I´m sure there must be one around the internet. And by definition any Triangular Moving Average is supposed to repaint. Are you sure your version doesnt ? Also, do you have mq4 file ?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I think this might be TMA True: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...94#post4698094

--- 帖子 #166 ---
The TMA is a 56 period LWMA with two bands of 2ATR(100) around it. So just use a 56 LWMA and move on.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I am not an expert but I think the ATR is what makes the TMA repaint, ATR is not static. If we were to use a simple 56LWMA, what would be the best Upper and lower level?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
@djms could you please assist me on setting these indicators as my chart doesn't look like yours. Thanks

--- 帖子 #169 ---
stress free trading on ga, is anyone else trading this or we all just gonna mess around with indicators all day? - the system is sound guys, use a tma/tma true, turtle channel, half trend, trend magic indis whatever you want. just stay with trend and take pullbacks.........

--- 帖子 #170 ---
do you still use Macd or the sr indi? i dont think so?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Deejayms? Is that you?! Good job pal

--- 帖子 #181 ---
He did mention some posts back he did not have the need for MACD as he was using MA's instead for trend. The only other reason to use MACD is for divergence I guess DJ is having success trading the pullbacks anyway. Well for SR it's always better to use your own anyway so it's not important if he uses an indicator for this. I'm sure DJ will be along to answer this himself for you though

--- 帖子 #182 ---

hi again everyone, Here is my latest, So the ma bbbands repaint( both the bands and the arrows repaint) the tma bands and the crosses repaint. I dunno but someone wrote a whole story about how the true tma don't repaint. And since the op said follow the trend and trade pull backs. I found on ffactory a trend following indicator that belongs to tudor girl. So its not mine I just searched and found it on one of the forums. I think its brilliant for seeing multi time frame trend action. Its got 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 1 hr all in one place. So if all colors of the tudor girl are same, trade the 1 min or 5 min on pull backs in the direction of color(trend). Hopefully the true tma don't repaint so just use the bands to trade pull backs. Sorry there is no magic cross or arrow to show u the band touches. Or if the true tma repaints than just use a old fashioned trend line and trade the pull backs to the trend line.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
LoL. Too true. No need to over think. Maybe just beginners luck for me but this system is a beast and fun. I'm making it work just as DJMS has prescribed, making the adjustments that he has made as this thread progressed which made it even easier. Repainting has been no issue. Seems that if you are waiting long enough for significant repaints then you are not acting quickly enough for this system. I started with micro lots until I got the hang of it. Wait for the set ups, then shoot the fish in the barrel. For now, I see no need to seek any other types of scalping strategies. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Well done, DJMS! You are too kind to share this system. But I believe only few will really know the power of this. I'm also a fans of TMA. But more to the side of using it as confluence adder (while my main analysis is based on SRs). Seriously, I'm really confuse why people still keep trying to find the non-repainting stuffs, that's not the structure of the market. Focus on SRs, then use the TMA method (as powerful confluence) to find entry. That's the holy grail (for me). Example on GJ this Asian morning using your template/method: Attached Image (click to enlarge) UJ: Attached Image (click to enlarge) EU: no Bullish OB. Can be traded with smaller risk if you wish Attached Image (click to enlarge) The strike rate for this is impressive once one can focus on trading just this single style (sadly, most don't and won't.) I'm also trading Asian and London first 3 hours, we might be able to work together if you wish Thanks DJMS and wish you tons of green pips!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Cant agree more. But I think this mod will help. As it is the same TMA+CG you use but the arrows and alerts will only happen if the T3 clean 240 and 50 are in the right place. P.S. you must have T3_clean indicator in your indicators folder. No need to attach them in your chart. Unless you want to use them (of course).

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks Djms... Could you please elaborate how you use Higher Time Frame/Multi Time Frame analysis when using say, trading on 15 Min TF?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I can't get this version of TMA +CG mladen to show the bands. The other versions..even the one with T3 dependencies shows the bands. I'm not sure if I like the T3 relationship or not...need to test. Wonder if anyone else had issues with the bands in Post 165 not showing up from the version mentioned?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Billy, great call to look out for higher timed charts and more minute analysis on the candle sticks. DJMS talks briefly about this on post 26 where he mentions bulls getting exhausted after about 10 long "X's".

--- 帖子 #197 ---
What do y'all think? If you get caught in a trade like this where T3 240 and T3 50 cross like this short that I took at the white arrow drawn? I'm thinking just move my very tight SL out further. I might consider closing with a small loss if it wasn't for the longer term downward trend for this pair, but it still seems like a low risk trade in the long run. May just take more time to materialize as a winner.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks Fiber Stage... Much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Thanks Dezil...

--- 帖子 #200 ---
In relation to my post directly above, I did move my SL out on shorts that got caught right before T3's diverged (still within reasonable risk mgmt) and waited out this fake rally, a.) because J is trending strong across pairs and b.) especially on EJ the buying volume was really weak. HODL was the right move and rewarded me with about 250 pips on the next strong down turn on CHF and EUR. Trust the system! Fake rally across the board in this pic:

--- 帖子 #201 ---
It's hard to believe that you are a new to trading... That's excellent analysis man...

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Fiber Stage, Could you please elaborate more on how one identifies a potential fake move by using multiple pairs of the same currency? Thanks

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi man, for me, If I get caught like this, I'll either move my SL to BE (if possible) or just accept the loss. I never move my SL further from the initial level as it's not according to my risk plan. The "edge" of this kind of method is pretty large, so I'm okay taking the loss and wait for the next signal. I don't want to play with the "luck" side as it could do more harm than good. But from your pic, price have traveled to the other side of the band and that's mostly my TP area. The RRR is also good about 1:1 Attached Image May I know which pair is this? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
That was NZDJPY, which I swore off trading rest of the night as it was way to choppy. In all honesty, I don't remember why I did not exit those trades when it hit the other side of the band. Maybe I got distracted. I agree with you about not moving the loss if it is up to the limit on my mgmt. I'm usually starting these trades with SL about 10 to 15 pips away. My limit on this kind of scalp is 50. So moving away to 30 was not out of my rules... though it was a little wild. Thanks a lot for your input here and all other posts during session.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
You are welcome, mate. I'm just sharing some of my cents here as I've been using this (similar) method for quite long (M1/H1 SR+TMA without the T3 lines). I scalp with positive R so my risk is always smaller than my reward. I've learned my 'bitter' lesson in the past with moving SL further from entry level, so won't do it again. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I'm using a CSI at M1, M5, M15 for a snapshot. (attached) I'm also comparing price action relative to volume. If I see an anomaly, i.e. wide spread candle with below avg volume and vice versa, within a large move to the up or down side, it with be a red flag to me as a fake. Seems to work and be logical. I'm watching price and volume simultaneously on another chart while watching DJMS's set up. A good match.

guilherme - have you hard coded the 50 and 240 cos I noticed if I change the values in the indicator it doesn't change the T3 on the chart.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
no. it is not hard coded. but the indicator will not plot the T3 lines. it will just get their values to see if 240 is above or bellow 50. it plots just the band and arrows. if you change the periods of T3, you must also change the indicator T3 you have on your chart.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
check out this s/r indi, many times a trend doesnt come back to the bands or when it does it come back it can reverse leaving you with a bad trade, with the t3 lines confirming the direction we can use the s/r indi. uptrend = old resistance becomes new support. downtrend = old support becomes new resistance.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
as billyoneer was saying its good to tie in the bands with s/r as well - you can see here on uj when the best time to hit the bands would be

Yep yep! Thanks for the credit, DJMS. SR is the structure of the market. Price attracts to them like magnet. Trade off them is the safest after the flip and potentially with much smaller risk size. I use just SR + TMA alone and they are working great. But adding your T3 lines give more boost of confidence Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #223 ---
yep yep! - s/r tied with the bands is way forward

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Haha Yeah, require a bit of exercise before we can used to the area and drawing them. that indi is helpful but I prefer blank chart with TMA (and your T3s now. LOL). Btw, UJ is at a scary resistance now, anyone trading this pair be careful when taking long setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

here a valid signal on m5, you can see the s/r to the left, price is hanging out bands t3 50 is under 240 when the trade came in, wait for your trend continuation candle to form then get in. using s/r with bands and t3's there was loads of opportunities to get short on this market today

welcome new traders and great trades guys, now we need to work a bit harder on exits. To the other side of the bands is fine but often you can catch a bigger move. I was thinking to maximise a move you can open multiple trades or just one with higher volume. close partial at edge of bands then trail remaining using s/r? see below s/r indi for those requesting

saw this higher TF setup Attached Image (click to enlarge) thanks for the new S&amp;R indy. looking forward to checking it out.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Djms, I think opening multiple positions and closing partially is a good idea. Just my idea: One portion at the band, 2nd portion at next S/R and perhaps trailing the 3rd portion till the cross of 50 with 240.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Djms, I see that There isn't any cross. What would your advice be: Substituting S/R for Crosses/Touch of Bands or confluence of both S/R+Touch of Band/Cross? Thanks

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Entered that one and closed at upper band. There was a cross, however a trader must be flexible as long as it was preceded by a HH.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
my t3's line up and price broke through previous structure so when it came into my bands i never got a cross but there was enough s/r there to hopefully hold the price up some more. You can change the settings of the bands to your own preference.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I look at H1 for major SR and M30 to M1 for minor SR or to adjust the levels. Also I have the daily pivot and round numbers levels on.

or if you like you can use the attached EA for trailing. Edit: Sourse of EA https://www.mql5.com/en/code/11649

Thanks for posting this scalping set up djms - it works well. I've adapted it slightly to try and get better entries and exits, so my base chart is a 3min (from Flexi Bars at www.ovo.cz ) with a slow macd and that is what is keeping me in this Dax trade from this morning (the entry was taken off the 1 min). The red 9 period macd hasn't crossed back above the zero line on the pullback so I'm staying in the trade. Could've gone either way and may still do as Yellin' Janet is speaking as I type.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
was kinda hoping for this trade to go wrong so i can post loosers as well but it just flicked into the bottom band - wasnt 100% on that trade just kinda blindly trading the strat. I'll try to post some loosing trades as well, it;s not all roses....

Hi bro. Are you still using MA_BBands ? I found that bollinger is repainting but how about the arrow ( signal ) ? Do you find that it is not repainting ?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I'd really like to hear your thoughts on why price action was strong enough for you on that EJ trade. Was it the shooting star and subsequent doji that appeared just above your SL? Did you get in as that second engulfing bear appeared? Thanks!

See the mark up... 2 broke 1 then the engulf at 3. Simple stuff.

nice trade - ended up running 70 ticks, we weren't to know that at the time but i think before trading its important to check higher time frames cuz on m30 and h1 it showed clear downtrend at the time meaning we can hold our trades for longer. i like the rules of getting out at the bands but if we trade m1 then switch to 30 min for eg we can exit when the 30 min candle hits the bands, open to suggestions........... there was a good few set ups after this one that meant we could trade aggressively on that move turning 70 ticks into a lot more.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
nice trading back to support and structure on an uptrend is classic, again looking at the H4 then switching to m1 we could have traded this move aggressively. i think using the higher time frame confluence could be the icing on this cake

DJ, thanks for sharing your system. I've been testing is on a small live account and the results have been fantastic. I have it set up on a 1m, 5m 15 and 1H so that I can have the full picture including S/R levels. Most of my trades have been off the 5m as I find the 1m a little too hectic for me. But having the 1m open gives me an early clue about the short term direction change. All in all, I really like this and like everybody's contribution to the thread. Thanks guys, keep on sharing

this one happened quick. actually got lucky with the timing. i wan't around for the first signal and after seeing divergence took the next one. i looked at the m15 band and S&amp;R for TP. the macd contradicts the t3. i'm just watching both to get an idea of what each look like in action. 1:3 RR Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I can't believe people! Show them a tool and all they focus on is what's wrong with it! No system is perfect. This one is pretty good! I have traded it and am finding it to be very simple. I have only had a couple of losses out of about 15 trades. Thank you DJMS, you a champ.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
no problem at all its a pleasure to share something with the community, please post some of your trades to help others if you have the time......

--- 帖子 #280 ---
My thoughts exactly Jakeod. I too have been using DJ's system and having a great time with it. If it doesn't for for some people all they have to do is NOT USE IT. This has been distributed freely and guess what, some of the complainers couldn't make money no matter what system you give them. Some people should just bug off.

EURJPY Thanks djms.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Djms, Thanks for the system mate... 1.You said, you don't trade high impact news, do you also stay on sidelines during the medium impact news items? 2. What would you suggest in terms of S/L for higher time frames like 15 Min, 1 HR etc...?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thank you so much Can anyone help me about mql4 file function?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Great example for why to sit out high impact news: GJ at 09:30 GMT. I keep a tab of FF calendar permanently open. Stay frosty!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Thanks for the example buddy...

--- 帖子 #286 ---
using donchian instead of tma, sorry i keep switching things up guys but for me the donchian channels make life easier plotting your s/r. price often doesnt extend to the bands but will pull back into structure. trend still identified with the t3's but some more structure play coming in. few losses today but thats usual, this is no holy grail mwahaha but i still made points even though got some losses. higher time frames say down on this one so i;ll hang back taking more longs unless it breaks topside and pulls back in.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
DJMS Thank you for sharing this, it is great. Only just found it today and have read all of the posts and can see how it's evolved. Can you confirm that I have attached all of the latest recommended indicators to my chart. I have PZ support/resistance, T3 Clean, 50 and 240 and TMA+CG. I tried to use Ryders file from post 95 but just get a line of Ivory coloured bars at the bottom of the chart and I am sure this is incorrect. Once again, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
What's the arrow indicator that you're using with this?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
t3's say short so thats half the battle sometimes, back to structure and donchian and brn thats my last one for today....

--- 帖子 #290 ---
lol

--- 帖子 #291 ---
What Donchian channel are you using?20 period?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
did you say higher TFs say down but you will keep taking longs?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Djms, Sorry to be a bother, but could you attach the indi+template of the latest revision... Thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Caution! Donchian Channel is often used for breakouts and not reversals. Unless you have a new twist to it.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
What's the arrow indicator that you're using on this chart?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
you can use them for breakouts but your strike rate will be terrible because of low R:R you will get in down trend i look for pullbacks to upper channel visa versa on uptrend, i use the channels to draw my s/r as well see attached pic

--- 帖子 #297 ---
It's looking like a super channel indicator not Donchian Channel ! Please correct me if i am wrong.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
possibly.... whatever its called it helps make my life easier haha but you can just use original support resistance indi - doesnt matter so long as it helps you spot structure.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Yes.It's better than TMA channel.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I was just checking out this system thanks for sharing but could we get the latest update of indicators and template please? I trade a similar system at the minute, but would like to try this it looks pretty good IMO good job.

Sry, wrong reference.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
First entry of this system..

--- 帖子 #303 ---
It's the MA_BBands_v3.2 that someone posted earlier in the thread. I just removed it from my chart. Don't worry about it. It was another band indi like the TMA. Just wait for DJ or some other kind soul to post this new DON band indi and use that. I know I will.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Its awesome to see a thread that helps its author improve his own system! The thread awaits the most updated template!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I trade from the 1000 GMT candle and am perfect in backtest trading but have a devil of a time choosing the correct pair to concentrate on. Today it looked like eurusd was headed up but stayed flat, eurjpy looked up on H1 but had a beautiful down move that gave many many pips. Try &amp; use MAs &amp; visually choose a 2 or 4 o'clock heading and then go to M5 for trades but have no consistency, would appreciate any helpful ideas, thx

--- 帖子 #306 ---
HI there, Just read through 16 pages of this thread. Firstly, your work is amazing and so is everyone here that has been contributing so kudos on that. In light of the many changes along the thread, can i clarify, the basic situation for an entry for Short would be: Firstly, a downtrend, which is 3 bands below the green T3 line, Secondly, a white cross ontop, Third, a candle to close below lower band and then a pullback to upper band. Likewise vice versa for Long . Hope to get some feedback since i was late to the party

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi djms. Been following your thread for a while: interesting scalping strategy. It looks like beside the new indi (which I too would say is a super signal channel indicator) you have made the shorter T3 more sensible (I would say around 30). Mind sharing your latest findings, please? Of course a template would be best. TMA although repainting can be good, but as you said, the price could keep away from from the opposite band for ages while trending, thus voiding many good entries. It seems like you might have cracked it.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Djms, Could you please attach the latest revision/template. Much appreciated bro. Thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
not a lot going on here lately. hope people are making some pips. havn't had much time myself to trade due to work. so managed to get a HTF trade in. set TP at T3 because of lower highs and lower lows. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Sorry Don't trade it anymore so deleted it.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
just found this a few days ago, studied it and started trading it on demo today to test it out! I really like it! I been looking for a scalping strat to grow my account this seems like it! I think i'll go live with it next week! super easy, find trend place trades accordingly. Any recommendations for lot sizes/number of pips to expect?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Honest opinion. If you don´t know yourself, it´s most likely not a good idea to go live next week.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
actually I figured it out already. just tried different trades with different lot sizes. Found one that works well.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
It is a good system even if the TMS repaints. Just need not to be greedy. The key is to know when to enter a trade and to exit.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
That is always the key, no matter what. But remember, the better the signal of the TMS, the more it repainted.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
If you apply the rules rigidly this has the potential to be a great system. I am relatively new to trading and it makes sense to me. DJMS great work I am currently testing this and writing out a cheat sheet ( SOI Standard Operating instruction ) if that's ok with you ? Your name is on the front cover, I don't take glory from others hard work.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
if does I traded it for just a few hours yesterday and I made 15 bucks on demo with just .01 lots off a 100 dollar account. ( I trade demo like real, so there's not confusion when I switch to live) It's super simple. I'm curious if I can figure out how to make an EA out of it.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hello everybody. This is just the kind of trading that fits me. Ive been looking for this and i am very grateful with the creator . ive been using it during a week , triying and testing but as im not an experienced trader and also novice scalper i am not shure if im doing well. Im using an emergency sloss of 3x atr, not intended to be touched,( just un case something big hapens) but if the price goes against me on the first candles i just close the trade . also the sloss is moved to b.e as soon as the price give me some space. Its giving me a high percentage of small winings and bevens but also a few comparatibely big looses. Maybe someone with more experience with the system can give me his/her opinión about it and share how are they working. Maybe a fixed sloss and take profit works ok and im doing it much complex than it is...

Hey DJMs, nice system you got here, love it. Would you mind to share you'r Donchian channel indicator, please. Thanks in advance! *EDIT; Hey guys, I wanted to let you know that I found the channel indicator and it's actually in two parts. One indicator draws the signal dots and the other indicator is the channel, "weak"(or fast) channel actually. I believe theres a third part, an indicator for the "strong" channel or slow/main channel, it is not used in this system tho. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Third, Thanks for posting the RSX 3c indi. Questions: a) are settings the same for all timeframes? do you use the indi's default setting or set your own? b) the vertical green/red lines - did you incert them manually for clarity or are they placed by the indi - I do not see anything in settings suggesting I can allow the lines to be placed. Thanks again.

Hi DJMS, any recent updates on this strategy? Are you still using this system, and how have your results been recently? Would be good to start some dialogue on this thread again. Thanks for sharing your strategy by the way.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi guys. I use ZeroLagMA at period 50 to close order and reverse. It helps a lot. If the MA cross middle TMA, then trend will be reverse. I would hold if it did not cross. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I wish this can be turn into EA.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi, Look very nice ! Congratulatios ! But what TMA exactly you are using in this chart? Can share all indicator in this chart?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I use the TMA+CG mladen given on #post 1. You can use all indicator given as it gives you the idea using this system. I remove other indicator,only TMA+CG mladen and just add ZeroLagMA in the chart. Its simplify because I'm new in trading. For reversal, I use Close and reverse script. You can also put sell/buy limit 3 or 4 steps as the price sometimes went against it. Martingle is best used here if this can be turn into EA. if you are in doubt, you can put SL 10 pips. Hope this helps. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I checked again today. This is what I got. Use ZeroLagMA period 50 to determine reverse trend. When ZeroLagMA crosses Lower Band TMA+CGmladen, trend going up. Focus on Long position. When ZeroLagMA crosses Upper Band TMA+CGmladen, trend going down. Focus on Short position. T3clean (240) will comfirm. But make sure to check with M5/M15 for safety. Attached Image (click to enlarge) i don't know if this chart going sideways. it seems like sideways to me. Hope this helps. P/S: TMA+CGmladen is heavily repainting. create EA with it result in 'ghost'. But for the swing function i think it can be made. Anyone interested to try?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi bUbai, I modified your system a little. Instead TMA+CGmladen I used TMA true. It does not repaint. I also added an indicator CS_Shahed58. Here is an example on AUDJPY. Short trade. ZeroLagMA crosses middle TMA. On the indicator CS_Shahed58 AUD must be red and JPY green in the upper line. I entered on the candle close. I use pending order. Stop loss 10 pips, target 11 pips. Look at the picture.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
These are closed trades (6) and opened trades(3). If they do not hit the target, I will close them manually. Because it is traded on 1 min chart an EA is necessary.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Could you attach your template and indicators please mate?

Hey friend, whats the difference for price must be red and green in the upper line or in bottom line? i see sometimes the pairs are on RED and GREEN but on bottom and not on upper line... Thanks for your contribution!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Look at post 345. ZeroLagMA is above middle TMA. We want to go short. AUD is red (this currency is weak), JPY is green (this currency is strong). I hope you catch it now.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Yes i saw the post, but my question is appear on buy and sell two colors: red and green. Sometimes also the price is green for both (buy and sell) and sometimes is RED for buy and sell

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Howdy djms . Its nice to see a thread on the good old TMA . I agree also it does work very well on the Yen ,, as i trade ONLY 1 pair ,,, the Pound Yen GJ . Thank u for this thread . I would like to add something IF i may for the benefit of all . In order to have a very high level of success trading the TMA on this pair , on MUST have a deep understanding on Price action ,,, and i mean as to WHY and WHERE the market is heading ,,, which is something that can be mastered in my humble opinion ,,, cause we all know the market does NOT do a Sunday afternoon walk in the park hahahaha . Here are a couple of example as to how tight ones entries can be IF they can study to get that DEEP and FULL understanding as to WHERE and WHY are the stations of turning points as i mentioned above . These are NOT guessing entries as they are fully calculated and based on 100% price action knowledge and experience. Correlation of Time frames is extremely important ,, as it should NOT be traded based just on the 1 mnt chart Hope this helps some fellow traders Cheers

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Look at the picture. Maybe it will help you.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Thanks friend! On this picture you consider CAD strong or only when the upper line is green? Because on this case both is green. For example on GBP only the upper line is green and bottom not, so this currency is strong now. Btw thanks for the template, i've got one green and other trade is running.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Yes,you caught it.

Hi guys. I just blew my account running averaging EA this month. So I'm gonna start manual trade again to cover up the loss. Just gonna share this here. ==ZeroLagMA 96 against TMACGmladen== Follow the trend This system or strategy or whatever you wanna call it, can be use to get your trade along with the trend. Rules: -Buy = ZeroLagMA 96 CROSS BELOW Lower Band TMACGmladen Take Profit when ZeroLagMA 96 CROSS ABOVE Lower Band TMACGmladen (into middle TMA) -Sell = ZeroLagMA 96 CROSS ABOVE Upper Band TMACGmladen Take Profit when ZeroLagMA 96 CROSS BELOW Upper Band TMACGmladen (into middle TMA) Can be use on any TF. Attached Image (click to enlarge) DISADVANTAGE: -You have to wait for the line to cross to take profit. (You should use S/R if you are good with it to set TP) -Take Profit too early.(This annoyed me (T.T) ) Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see in the picture above, if you take profit as the rules, you'll miss out more pips. Might as well take profit when rules for buy appear. Conclusions: This is a safe way to trade but you will miss out some greens. Indicator I made online to help me catch the cross-line is in attachment. Feel free to try. TF M1 sends to many alert due to repainting. TF M15 and above have less false alert. I tried using TMA True but I can't find the best setting yet. So this is it for now. Hope to see green soon.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
They call it FOMO for short thats fear of missing out esp on more pips but remember banking them and patience also make for great profit.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
bubai many thanks for sharing! Is there an alert to your indicator? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #367 ---
The indicator does not draw the line.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
No lines shown on this indi

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Yes the indicator attached does not draw the line. It pop up arrows and stop sign to give me alert. That line is ZeroLagMA period 96 and TMA+CGmladen. Search for it from previous post. It is repainting, so make sure to use bigger TF.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
bubai what is your settings? I find the arrow is repainting.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Can someone help to add the email and push alert for your great indicator ZeroLagMAcross96X.mq4 ? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I'm sorry guys. ZeroLagMAcross96X that I gave just didn't work properly. I just missed one trade. and waiting for SL. I'm not a coder so I just made the indicator online. It should give alert when the buy/sell rules appear. Attached Image (click to enlarge) That arrow didn't appear last time. But the line did cross there. Maybe due to repainting. After I refresh does the arrow shows. But the rules is there. Just the indicator is not good to give alert.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
bubai please share your zerolagma and TMA settings. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
ZeroLagMA put on 96. TMACGmladen use the default setting. Attached Image Attached Image

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I made a new indicator for this strategy. The arrow will appear when zeroLagMa 96 CROSS UP/DOWN upper/lower band TMA AND Candle close above/below ZeroLagMA line. It will appear on next candle. I put sell limit above it a few pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think I made a really bad mistake here. TMACGmladen is repainting heavily. I will not suggest anyone to try this strategy. Look at pic below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The signal changes after refresh EVEN AT H1. (T T) On the good side, the first signal is still at the same level with new signal. I will try with other nonlag indicator later when I have time.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
After several try-and-error with TMACGmladen and ZeroLagMA, I have finally found a good entry and exit strategy. I am glad all those time on this indicator doesn't go to waste. I hope this can help all of you also as I am using this to gain back the loss. Indicator as attach below (already attached on several post but why not) : - TMA+CGmladen (use default setting) - ZeroLag_MA (use period 96..see previous post for example) - fxr_sr_zones 3.11 (latest from source website) &lt;-- Thank you djms. I now grasps the use of SnR and its really helps a lot. - ReverseTMA(TP) ..Now this is the what I came out with. This here is a filter to TMA+CGmladen. Instead of Open order by TMA+CGmladen alert, use this. I use this to enter position on TF H1 and it really is powerful. See chart below. - ReverseTMA(OP)...Use this to open position on M1, M5 and M15. It much safer. - aFFCal (1) ...this is news filter. Same as provided by djms. - QFF-CandleCountdown - Just some Add-on to see when next candle appear..also provided by djms. Rules: - TF H1 and above: Open position when yellow stop sign appear. Close order when yellow sign appear on opposite. (Duhhh..) You can also open order on arrow. - TF 30 and below: Open position when arrow appear. Close order when yellow sign appear on opposite. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) On EJ, as you can see, I open short as per signal and put TP according to SnR level. Lucky me because EJ just enter swing at that time. USDCHF might come to swing next week. I hope so. djms said on 1st post this strategy works well on jpy pair. Just reminder that this is PURELY from TMACGmladen which is a repainting indi. So there are risks to it. Alert only appear on screen. I don't know how to put alert to email. I am not a coder. Conclusion: Same strategy as original post. Instead of T3_240 line to find trend, I use ZeroLagMA for filter. I have made an EA for this but due to its repainting, it open a lot of order. But still it gives 30% profit with low DD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I wil have some coder improve it first then I might share it later. Thanks mladen for indi.

I seriously don't know why its different. I pull everything off and put the the template again, it works just fine. It seems ReverseTMA(TP) is missing the signal above TMACGmladen upper band in your chart. Anyone else have any idea whats going on? Or having the same problem?

These are a few trade I get: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I start 10$ and here is my trade now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Always look at the higher TF for comfirmation. I don't have time to do scalping at M1 yet. Once I have, I will surely share it here.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Btw your system on lower time frames does not work there are many many false signals i have tested it for you on range bars and renko bars also and on all three systems inc of the one hour chart the signals disappear for what reasons i do not know but wanted to test as i use tma as a visual guide only just saying for traders who see these charts and thing oh great the truth is the signals will disappear from time to time and leave you with the thought of will the next signal disappear too or not .. just saying have been a tma fan for over 5 years and still am. 30 minutes chart actually seems the most reliable so if u trade this way keep a 30 mins chart open as a guide it seems more in motion with the market and although signals disappear most seem to stay on this the 30 mins time frame so hope this helps gave it a really long test for you guys try it on a one min or 5 mins and you will see it fail ok just a heads up

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thank you for the advise. I will try trade in 30 minutes chart. Can you try see if this one is better? I filter the signal using fisher indi. It should have less false signal. Or atleast it should be in SnR level where it bounces back. A few signal will breakout the SnR level but it will bounce back on the next SnR.

reverse tma tp indicator can you do the following and upload it here again with the settings that you have already made reduced by 50 percent i know this indicator works fine on my mt4 if you can do this then i should be able to upload some charts tomorrow with a more profitable system .. its not perfect but then nothing is. My concern is always how price can move and the tma moves with this and then a signal appears i am trying to reduce the space when price moves against us and a false signal which will be late will appear and the tma moves with this to create the late signal ..

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Mr bUbai ; I try to attached your indicator but seems nothing happen and i dont see any line on my chart

--- 帖子 #407 ---
The coder replied way too busy to look at the tma code - just an update.

Here it is again. Attached File(s) ReverseTMA(TP).mq4 5 KB | 752 downloads This one filtered using Fisher_Yur4ik: Attached File(s) ReverseTMA(TP) (Rev1).mq4 5 KB | 925 downloads if it did not show on chart, i just don't know what to do. Try compile it again. It is mq4. Edit: I just had a hunch here. the indicator did not appear on chart is it because I used TMA+CG mladen as it base? Do you have TMA+CG mladen indicator in your indicator file?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
ok no worries sure we can sort it out around here .. will run some more tests tomorrow. I sometimes find different brokers with MT4 use different tricks for sure but lets see if we can move this forwards by Wednesday.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
still cant get the second indicator to show on the chart the (rev1) just an update

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Do you have Fisher_Yur4ik_2? I hope this will helps. Attached File(s) Fisher_Yur4ik_2.mq4 2 KB | 777 downloads

Ok loading it now, i had the other fisher perhaps an outdated fisher indicator.most I have tested as much as i can and i feel the 30 mins chart is the best to trade from. but YOU HAVE to make up your own minds and test it out on the 30 mins and then DECIDE for yourselves i am not responsible for other traders mistakes losses or general well being its up to you but look at the 30 mins go back in time see the lagging zones and realise how best you can trade the signals If you have a 30 mins and 60 mins chart side by side then this might work out fine also the 4hr turns too slowly and under the 30 mins the signals are too false so try a 30 and 60 mins together and see how you get along be cautious trade carefully and always use the stop loss. One final point is that the market can play some tricky moves from time to time we know this so watch and follow and put the hours in. However the question will always be what to do when a trading signal appears and then disappears as it leaves you sitting there wondering should i trade or not. Try looking at for instance a one hour signal using a four hour chart in this way if your long term trading it might just limit the larger losses, however it might also get you in on the move too soon - so potentially there are ways to improve on this system the day i get an indicator which opens on the candle and stays there will be a first such is the game, a question being do the pro's out way the con's here well its a 50 50 take from me but if you can manage a system with a 50 percent profit than perhaps it might not be so bad - we all see things differently and this take on the system is purely mine yours i am sure will be different.

Hi BOedge... do you have a version that has Push Notification when arrow drawn? Would be much appreciated

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi bUbai, how does your strategy go?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
My balance now is $35. I start 3 weeks ago with $10. I added T3_clean to filter ranging market. Next month I will add more fund and go for bigger lot. I targeted $50 end of this month. I can only trade after works which is why I can't scalp at M1 like djms on 1st post. On H1, you'll need patience buy still,it helps me gain a bit profit. My intention actually is to make EA from this strategy, but the repainting make it impossible.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Subs. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I have always wondered if the repainting problem would be solved if a higher time frame like 4h tf was used along with TMA with a smaller TP. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #418 ---
bUbai, Thanks for posting the indi. What setting do you use (10?)? Do you use different settings for different timeframes (1H, 30M, 15M)? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I use default setting for Fisher indi on all TF. Haven't tried any other setting yet.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Someone could change the indicator for email and push notifications

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I need someone to try this one. I filtered ReverseTMA(TP) with NonLag Inverse Fisher transform of RSX by mladen. It turns out really good. But the indicator takes too much time to load. And only on a few charts the indi loads. (GBPUSD and XAUUSD) I tried on TF 5M. If anyone would like to test, it would be great helps. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) ReverseTMA(TP)+FisherRSX.zip 8 KB | 1,337 downloads Edit: In my mt4, this indi only load on 1 chart. I can't make it load on multiple chart. Why is it like that? This is how you can filter false signal using NonLag Inverse Fisher transform of RSX. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #423 ---
does it repaint ? can't test it cause it makes my platform crash

--- 帖子 #424 ---
This indi repaint. Its not good to use on lower TF. After 4 candles, when the TMA line repaint and the indi disappear. Only realiable to use on TF H1. Even on TF30M sometimes there are different signal. I give you example where my trade went the wrong way.

How is everyone's progress? I have been using this https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...7&amp;d=1537390692 Genry has very kindly added an alert to it so its useful for our trading of TMA. Along with the TMA+CG Mladen filtered by T3 240/50. Not bad ideal would be to get it like Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Are you happy to share the Astro Reversal V2 indicator also? Thanks if you do mate.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I do not have it. I was thinking about it but after watching the videos on the channel it all looks too good to be true. So I am not sure yet. As I can find no one who has it. It may be amazing and I may get it just out of curiosity but if it looks too good it usually is. Thats why I was attempting to make my own with Genry's indi.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Thank you bUbai. Can you share your EA? Thanks. cocowell

--- 帖子 #429 ---
There are some god tools linked to in the Quantum London thread from Russian forum. Here is my set up combining what was generated here and some from the Russians traders. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hello, friends. I find that the signal of this indicator is delayed. Almost no yellow arrow can be seen in the current time.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
hi Bubai you have done a great job for newbies like us.my request is that can you please make a fisher down arrow alert as you made the fisher buy alert version.thanks

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I have a MTA statergy that I would like turned into an EA, Can anyone help ?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Anybody still experimenting with this system?

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yes try adding Tipu Heiken Ashi and Tipu CCI.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Gotta be be careful with TMA...., I got some questions with that video because the author did not account for some of the trades in the video. At certain times, the candle is not out of the TMA bands in real time. TMA repaints and so one has to be careful. I did not say it is a bad indicator, but just that one should test the strategy several times before using it.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Are you scalping the 1 and 5 minute charts with this system? How have your results been mate?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Nothing is perfect and I think this is pretty good with all the filters in this thread. TMA filtered by T3 gives you higher prob X marks, then the CCI arrows that mtch these you can take if outside the bands. I just playing with it as not main method. I trade BBMA usually but if no set ups then I look and play with other methods like this.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Do you fancy sharing your system mate? Im always interested to see other peoples approaches if it is profitable for you personally.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
The two ways I have traded this are with Tipu CCI arrows and Tipu Heken Ashi as mentioned above and also with the attached TMAcentered indi, indi generously produced by Genry via the quantum thread. But like I say BBMA is my main strategy and I play with what ever appears on FF. Pic of the set up a few posts up.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi BUbai, Are you still using this strategy? have you made further changes, I believe that I read one of your comments in which you mentioned that were planning to go live with this strategy. How are you doing? Kind regards

--- 帖子 #441 ---
So you use the BBMA instead of the TMA channel? Could you upload the BBMA strategy you use please mate?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Can anyone recommend a good price channel to use similar to the TMA that does not repaint? I find that many trades are missed using the TMA because as price moves upward or downward it drags the TMA 20 candles back or so, making many signals appear in the past that would not of been taken in real time. If anyone can recommend something other than TMA true that would be great.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Try any channel strategy on detrended price data. It is better.

BBMA Concepts: BBMA KG colour set: MA1 Hour - Orange MA4 Hour - Blue MA8 Hour - Yellow MA Daily - Red MA Weekly - Magenta MA Monthly - Aqua MA 4 Month - Brown MA Yearly - Purple MA 10 Year - White The MA arrangement will happened every day. For day trader, the Take Profit (TP) will be Daily MA. If swing weekly or monthly, then TP at Weekly MA or Monthly MA. Formula for MA arrangement is simple, it will have to complete the cycle (small MA look for bigger MA) then only it will move forward to the market trend. It will always be 1-4-8 Daily Weekly Monthly. This will happened when market open or prior to open. General Analysis for Open Position (OP): If MA1 is above the other MA, then OP Sell; If MA1 is below the other MA, then OP Buy. My 2 cents

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Sorry I missed this post. There is a BBMA thread in the commercial section. Settings can be found online. Join telegram group that is posted in that commercial thread. It is the BBMA English Chat. Search BlackoutFx on youtube and watch his videos on BBMA. Once you know the strategy this will make sense.....I target Reentry after CSM on H4. That means I am looking for Extreme on H1 and Extreme on M15.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi djms, just found your strategy 2 days ago and been following the market with it. I must say it's an amazing strategy! are you still using this ? do you mainly trade JPY pairs ? I found that GBP/USD is also good whats your oppinion ? do you trade other pairs ?. thank you

Hello friend, I'm glad you're doing well with the DJ system, see, are you still using it? I already installed the template but when I pass from 1 minute to any other, there are horizontal white lines that make it difficult to perform an operation, maybe this happened to you? Do you know how to solve it?

I know it's after the fact, but Ill include a screenshot of my trades from my FF TE for Nov 25. Thanks again. Edit: The trade listed at 9:10-9:12 was a technical mistake on my part.

After many years of FF I found the DJMS post and it is very well done. I noticed that the index Fxr-sr-zones-2.97 is no longer valid. where it can be updated or used even if the message that it is no longer valid appears. I would like to have the Hindi updated even if it's been a long time. Where can I find it. I searched but in vain. Thank you
