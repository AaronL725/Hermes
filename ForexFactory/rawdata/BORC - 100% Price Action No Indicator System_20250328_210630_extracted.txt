I will attempt to post setup alerts (whenever I can) prior to the actual setup so that people may watch price action at those levels. If other viewers are kind enough to do the same and contribute that would be great, and I am sure it will be appreicated by all viewers. Please read the PDF file attached here for a guide to the basic system, and follow along with the posted setups afterward (hopefully there wil be plenty of those posted as we move along with this thread). You may also go back in your charts and look for these to get a handle on these trade setups and how often they actually occur. Train your eyes to spot those and you will see these setups over and over again. Practise, practise and practise some more. Practice makes perfect, as they say. I welcome and appreciate your comments, but please try to make them constructive, as we are all grown ups here, and we are all here to learn from each other. Please keep this thread clean, and if you believe you can contribute and make a positive impact on the thread, please do so, and when you post setups please include the currency pair name, the timeframe and a chart to show what you are looking at (if possible). Thank you for respecting these rules. Let us all learn from each other and have fun doing it.

here is a possible setup that I would be looking for on the audusd pair... Note how the pair broke out of the utrend channel at about 9940. The uppper boundary of that channel is where I would be looking for this pair to retrace it, price stalling, get rejected, and then bounce back up. Let's watch and see

--- 帖子 #3 ---
just to demo my setup, here is one that occured about 9 hours ago(7 am EST) on the gbpusd 1HR chart ... again, just train your eyes to see those setups and wait for PA to confirm.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Her eis another setup I just entered (although it is end of NY day and it is a bit premature) but this is to just demo setup again ... Note that there is confluence of two lines here, let's watch this one

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Please be careful if you plan on taking this trade as there is high impact news coming affecting AUD out later on tonight.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
thanks to share really good way to trade

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thank you for your kind words, and I hope you find this thread useful. Please keep checking back in.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi PP, Another possible setup... Thanks V much for PDF - its kind of obvious and fundamental stuff but its great when its presented as a system to trade as you have and it gives it more clarity to me... I will be adding to my tool box and hope to share setups!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
this is the end of the work day for me, and I am going off line. I will not be online again until tomorrow morning NY time. I believe the PDF in first post is pretty self explanatory but if there are any questions I will attempt to answer them tomorrow. If you spot any good setups, please post them here. Thanks and good night.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thank you redart .. it is great to have you stop by here, and I am glad you are able to share some of the setups.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Always wanted to learn how to trade on pure PA, hope this will help me achieve that. The best of luck to you and thanks for the effort.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
excellent stuff. simple and easy to understand and no indicators !!! i will try to look for H4 and up.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi! PP, how to use ASFT exact entries? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Just drag the indicator onto your chart, and accept all default settings... This indicator will draw pivot point and 3 resistance and 3 support levels for you everyday. Those levels are nice to watch and likely to cause price to react at those levels.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank you roundrock, great to have you here, and I appreciate your looking for 4H setups ... looking forward to seeing those.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
did anyone take this setup? Note how the price spiked right u from the level indicated earlier ... this is a textbook setup. If you were to follow the suggested TP method, this one would have been a nice 1/3 at SL, a nicer 1/3 at about 30 pips and then the last 1/3 could netted you 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
This etup did not come to fruition, as mentiend earlier there were news coming out and as the price came close to the touchline marked on the setup and drove right through the level as the news was worse than expected for the AUD. This drives the point home that you need to be patient, wait for the PA to show its cards (candle formations confirming reversal at the level) and then also keep a close eye on news.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Watch PA at this level as that is the boundary of the uptrend channel (old support) that price decisevely broke through before ... May become new resistance here Here is the chart below ... look for SHORT here

--- 帖子 #19 ---
looks like th eprice is hsitating at this level (as expected) .. watch PA closely as it is near the daily Pivot Point also.. here is the chart again .. I would start shorting if t decisively breaks below the PP around 112.50.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
To add to the eurjpy going down theory, note that eurusd is bumping against the reistance level, which may influence the eurjpy going down ... watch closely as prce action develops.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I am in this one short at 112.45

--- 帖子 #22 ---
NOW note how the price is reacting to the S1 level (if you used the AFTS exact entry indicator on your chart) You could take small profit around this level as your first TP

--- 帖子 #23 ---
setting up for a short at this level (old support turned resistance)

--- 帖子 #24 ---
old resistance turned suport around 9900 (double zero round number also) in addition to hitting the lowere bundary of an uptrend channel ... this is what I call a AAA setup

--- 帖子 #25 ---
has bounced off old resistance now turned support around 0.7620 area. Long this pair

--- 帖子 #26 ---
how you can change the color of your manual trendline ? maybe its an indicator who do that ?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
double click the line to highlight it (you will see that it would have three anchor points that means it is highlighted or selected if you would.) Right click on it, and go to line properties, then change the colour using the "style" box ... hope that helps

--- 帖子 #28 ---
boked 1/3 profit at 112.25 for +20 pips. Moved my SL to 112.55 (rememebr entry was 112.45), just above daily Pivot Point on remaining 2/3 of the position.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
as price is bouncing off the lines here, I entered long both pairs 9915 on aud and 7650 on nzd

--- 帖子 #30 ---
no tricks, no magic, no voodoo, just another pa thread trading bop's. count me in!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
This pair is moving south off old support now turned resistance around 1.5820 level

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Booked profits on 1/3 on AUD at 0.9940 moved remaining to BE. It is getting to the lunch tim in NY and things will start slowing down (normally but not always). NEVER let your winning position turn to loser.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
OUT NZD on BE as well ... not liking where this is going now as action slows right down.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Nice summary of the method ... nice to have you join us plasmapants.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
It just feels that way that no one else is responding or commenting .... I have a feeling people are just trying to absorb the info and take it all in ... I hope I am right and not just talking to myself and confusing people I am taking off for lunch for about one hour. NOW don't be so loud in here .. haha

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I agree with you one hundred percent, can also count on me.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
second 1/3 profit taken at 112.00 (yes the round number closest to entry (112.45) for +45 pips profit n this second third ... leave the last third runing in case you hit a home run.. SL now moved to BE at 112.45 . LET IT RIIIIIIDE

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks for joining us

--- 帖子 #39 ---
gbpusd is looking like it is gonna keel over as it is forming a bearish englufing candle formation at the old support (may turn new resistance) level. Note this level is 15800 also the round double zero number ... get ready to g short if candle closes bearish and price follows through.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
This pair is going nuts now as BOE Gov King Speaks ... stand aside for a bit

--- 帖子 #41 ---
So, candle closes with engulfing bearsih formation below the 1.5800 ... this maybe a good time to enter short if price continues to slide down from here... HOWEVER, it is getting late in NY and very slow action ... it is up to you

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Looks like we did not get the follow-through required for a short entry here. NO TRADE

--- 帖子 #43 ---
PurePrice, you just use TF H1?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Mostly yes, because I get at least a couple of setups everyday. If I go longer, I will have to wait more and may not get setps for a few days. Also, that means I am in the trade longer and have bigger stoploss, etc. If I go shorter, I would have to check my charts alot more often, and perhaps "babysit" the trade a little more. Unfortunately I do not have much screen time and I am unable to do this. However, I would not go below 15-minutes as that is just too noisy.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
this setup make sense? AUDUSD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #46 ---
It is the end of trading day in NY. I have just existed remaining 2/3 of position at 0.9975 for +60 pips on this portion of the trade.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Stopped out at 112.45 whic is BE on the last 1/3 of this trade.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks for posting Lika, but I am not sure if you have a question or are you posting a setup... please clarify and thanks a bunch

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I am asking your opinion. Thanks

--- 帖子 #51 ---
that is exactly how I have my TL drawn. Note where the price is now... it is at a confluence of two TL and hourly candle has frmed a nice pinbar candle. You may see a rejection of price at this level and has the pair go down a few pips here if you get follow through on the next candle.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Here is the chart as we speak ... NOTE: this is NOT a BORC trade .. it is just simply a trendline/channel trade if you were to take this SHORT

--- 帖子 #53 ---
NOT A BORC TRADE but eurusd is bumping against upper boundary of the sideway chanel on hourly and has formed pin bar and doji at this zone .. might go down soon. BUT AGAIN, it is end of trading day in NY, and you may wish to wait till tokyo open to trade this setup if you wish .. again NOT a BORC trade but a strong channel trade.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I am not seeing much here in terms of new setups other than eurjpy going down again, as it tried to rally but now getting rejected at previous breakout level with a nice doji candle.. I am SHORT this pair again at 112.45 -- here is the chart below of this trade Keep an eye on eurusd, audusd and nzdusd as those three pairs are at upper boundary of their trend channels. If we get a nice clean breakout, then look for a BORC trade setup after the BO. I am signing off now as this is end of work day for me. For those of you who are in Asian or London zone, you may get setups before I check back in the morning after NY open. Please feel free to post your setups when you see them.

what I'm waiting on EURJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Lika, thanks for posting the eur/jpy chart. Any thoughts to which side it will break to? Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Momo, I'm posting to warn that a breakout is imminent, but I'm not waiting for the breakout, but the pullback after the breakout.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
This setup is correct ????? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Yes that is correct, I am seeing price hesitation at the 15870 area. a bearish candle has already formed, and now being followed what looks like a pinbar candle .. watch this area carefully and price action closely to see if you get the gbpusd tanking at this level. I would SHORt this pair if the price starts going down. BUT check news to see if there is anythign coming out at 8:30 NY time

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I just ForexFactory for news, and it looks like we have Home Sales out at 10:00 NY time and important FOMC statement at 2:15 pm ... I would be very cautious taking positions around FOMC as that tends to rock the market and things just swing back and forth and you get some crazy spikes most of those days.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hey Lika, Are you taking a SHORT position on GBPUSD? I am in SHORT at 15850 .. SL at 15900 TP1 at 15805

--- 帖子 #62 ---
here is the short trade setup

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I was looking around for something new at FF and I found this thread. Looks basic and very powerful tool. Thanks for sharing and opening my eyes wider at price action. It is always my desire to trade without any indicators at all. Happy trading. TL

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hello Trendylines, I certainly hope you find this thread of some use and helpful in your indicator-free trading ... wishing you many pips. Please keep checking back in as I try to post setups everyday to solidify the basic knowledge of the system by trade examples.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
If you did get in short on the GBPUSD trade, we have New Home Sales news coming out in less than 5 minutes, you may wish to tighten your stop.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Stopped out on the news. loss of 20 pips here as I did tighten my stop.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Is anyone actually following along or learning anything here? I'd like to know so that I know I am not just talking to myself an wasting my time. Thanks for responding

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I'm always here buddy, and always learning. Please continue Thanks

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I am here as well, please continue. I also lost 20 pips on GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks for responding. I will continue knowing that someone out there is listening ... lol

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks for responding and it is nice to have you join us. About the loss, it is always good to have a SL setup close when news comes out in case the news causes a reaction. Note that GBP is still struggling to get above the 1.5900 level and it is forming another doji candle up until this point. SOOO, it may still be a good idea to short if price continues down. HOWEVER, things will start slowing down now as traders wait for FOMC statement later on today at 2:15 pm NY time. So, it is possibly best to stay on the sidelines for now

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Pure Price – Just started following and trying to learn, it is very interesting. Please keep it going and thanks for doing this.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I've been following FF for I year, trading micros with little success, but I can see the simplicity in this system. Is there a preferable TF?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thanks for joining us, and I hope you wil learn a thing or two from this thread. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
NO trade short on this one, as the candle did not close bearish.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I personally like 1HR timeframe.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
There may be a reversal BORC trade developing around this level. Watch PA closely and again, high impact news FOMC statement coming out in a little over one hour, so be cautious.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Just a short message to say that I like your thread very much. There are not a lot of traders on FF who can trade the 1h like you do - the 1h being the division between swing trading and intraday. Thank you, I am subscribed. _____________ michael

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thank you msmarple for your kind words .. glad to have you with us.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I know I know .. i keep going back and forth on this one, but this pair is certainly not able to close above the 1.5900 mark for the last few hours, even though it has tried on a few of those one hour candles. This is the level where there is BORC setup with a downtrendline confluence, and the round double zero 15900 number acting as resistance. Will we see this level hold and the gbpusd tank from here?? Again, as mentioned above the GBPJPY may also be reversing at current levels thereby helping the gpbusd to go down also. Watch PA closely as FOMC is coming out in about 75 minutes. If we do not get the reversal we are waiting for, we may get a continuation and a fast breakout, if you so wish to trade (and are yourself comfortable with) this setup ... let's see where PA takes us ....

--- 帖子 #81 ---
will check back in just before and after FOMC statement .. have fun

--- 帖子 #82 ---
which the setup that has to happen before you make the trade? this particular case gbpjpy131.000

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Lika, Need to get a bearish candle formation around the 131.00 followed by confirmation of price action going down for a BORC trade. Judging by how the previous (1 pm) candle closed, it may not reverse and we may have a bullish breakout, BUT we have FOMC in 5 minutes or so, so stand on the sidelines for now

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Price I just found your thread I read the first and last page. It looks interesting I am going to read the the pdf then the rest of the thread. before I ask any questions. John

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Finally looks like this pair is breakout to the topside for a bullish ride up.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I am in long at 15910.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
SL set at BE, TP at 1.5945

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Looks like the pairs that maybe breaking out at this time are NZDusd and GBPusd .. you may want to check thoes two pairs a few hours later to see if there is a BORC setup on either one of those. GBPJPY is still currently a good candidate for a BORC setup at 131.00 .. wait for conditions to setup and see if you can get in short later on once Tokyo opens and moves the jpy pairs. Happy pip hunting and good night to all as I am signing off for now.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Looks like we had no BO on NZD but did on the gbpusd as expected (since it was brewing to BO one way or another) ... Did anyoen catch the BORC trade on the GBPUSD??? Unfortunately alot of these trades occur while I am sleeping and I do not catch them.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here is the trade setup ... Note the up arrow is where I would be looking to enter long... this "sleepng" thing gets in the way of trading ...lol ... If you live in euro zone, you should have been able to catch this one

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Quickly scanning the pairs I see a possible BORC setting up with EURCHF currently, and AUDUSD maybe soon (although it looks like this one may have already occured but may get rejected again at the same level).

--- 帖子 #92 ---
here is the setup . watch PA at these levels..Note that price is also at R1 level.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Looks like this pair is stalling again at theese levels ... considering going short

--- 帖子 #94 ---
What NOT to trade .... we did not get a nice clean BO above the line, and it is now retracing back to the line. I would not touch this one with a 6 foot pole

--- 帖子 #95 ---
NOT to trade this one either as this is just some nasty ranging price action .. there is no clear direction whatsoever .. avoid this like the plague ...

--- 帖子 #96 ---
We got a doji candle closing, but looks like price action is not following through for now ... keeping this on the radar screen

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Well, looks like this one is running away from us and heading north for a bulish BO.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
from what i understand, fractals only appear after the swing, right?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
This pair is heading up toward the 0.9945 area we are looking for it to stall, hopefully hit that trendline area and then head back down again .. watch PA around the current level.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
my point is, what's the use of fractals if it tells us after the fact?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I do not use fractals to make any decisions on the actual trade entry or exist. Nowhere in my PDF or examples do I mention using fractals. However, I "sometimes" find them helpful in drawing trendlines but not always, it is just a visual thing for ME personally, and I do not suggest using or not using it .. it is up to you.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
oh ok, thanks.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
This pair is back down to the 1.5900 level, which is it was strgulling with yesterday (old resistance) ... we may get a BORC trade setup here if the price gets rejected and turns into new support.. watch PA at these levels.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Price is surely getting rejected at the 9940 level for now

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Here is the chart ...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I am out 1/2 at 9905 as this is round doublezero and daily S2 level... +35 pips on this trade

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I entered second half of position a bit late at 9920. Keeping this one open for now

--- 帖子 #108 ---
AH HUH , this one is getting rejected pretty hard at the 13000 level. We are getting a nice railway track candle formation here to signal a bearish bias as we nearing the close of the cndle (although there is still 15 min left) .. watch this pair closely ... maybe a great BORC setup as mentioned early this morning

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Out the second half at the 0.9900 as this level is being very stubborn and the pair is having a hard time breaking through it. So for he audusd trade, out 1/2 at +35 pip out other 1/2 at +20 pip

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I have a Sell Stop order pending at 1.2940 as we ended up with a BEARSIH englufing candle close and hoping for price to continue going down. Initially SL would be at 1.3010, TP1 at 1.2920 (daily PP) and TP2 at 1.2870 (Daily S1)

--- 帖子 #111 ---
draw your R/S lines and trendline on eurjpy and gbpjpy and look for a BORC setup .. let me know if you see it or not .. feel free to share with the group

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Looks like we are getting some price hesistation at the 15900 level with a nice wick on the lower side of the previous candle. Price is trying to pierce through the 15900 level down but it is meeting good suport for now. Let's see how the current hourly candle ends up forming. If we get a bullish closed candle (I am thinking a pinbar now), I would consider getting in long on the next candle.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Well, this one again is going up and not following through to the downside .. too bad

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I cancelled my pending short order

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Pureprice agree? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I am long at 15925

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Looks correct, except it is not as "clean" of a breakout to the downside as I'd like to see normally. It is very congested and the breakut is not very clear and clean.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Here is the trade I am in . as expected it is very slow moving as it NY closing time. SL set at 1.5890, tp at 1.5980 Unfortunately not much to be looking for. Only ones to keep an eye on would be the eurchf, as indicated before this pair is struggling at 1.3000 and may tank down. the gbpjpy and eurjpy would be the other two pairs to watch for as possible BORC setups in the near future (after Tokyo open, as there is some news out of Japan 6:30 to 7 pm EST)

--- 帖子 #119 ---
If you have time during upcoming Tokyo and EU/London sessions to watch this pair, keep a close eye on this pair around 113.00 for a BORC setup if it makes it down that far. It is retracing now after hitting the daily trendline at around 114.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
this is nice PA strategic...thanks for the effort..

Great setup here Lika

--- 帖子 #124 ---
you got in here on the 15-min .. please make sure you have small TP and SL as this is a much shorter TF.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
got stopped out.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
did anyone catch this one .. exactly as expected, price went down to 113.00 and bounced up hard to the tune of about 55 pips?? Anyoen catch this trade??? I did not as I was sleeping, as always LOL

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Lika, Did you actually get into this trade?? It looks like it worked out perfectly for about 40 pips (113.05 to 112.65) on the 15 minute frame, which is great.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Are you short this one Lika??

--- 帖子 #129 ---
AS expected form yesterday, again .. did anyoen catch this one short as we waited for it all day yesterday ??? It happened during Tokyo it loks like for about 12975 to 12915 (60 pips or so) .. I again, did not catch this because of my NY time zone ... the stor of my life I hope somene else did though

Just an update on the 3 pairs I am watching ... I went short AUDUSD at .9965 .. initial TP at 9935 (which is daily PP)

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Lika, did you take this one short??

--- 帖子 #136 ---
yes, I did sell, and I have money in my pocket. In the pocket is that money is well LOL

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Did anyone take this one short, like Lika posted earlier?? this one is now good for 80+ pips

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Quick update ... I am out my first 1/3 of the audusd position at this is PP level. This is a nice easy +30 pips (thanks Lika for posting the setup) ... will let the other 2/3 position ride for now . moved SL to BE at 0.9965. TP set at 0.9905 for the remaining

Greetings PP... I will look at your PDF this weekend... Like your spirit! Cheers, G.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thanks Golden. Will be nice to have you join us if you are convinced with what the PDF says

--- 帖子 #143 ---
sorry Lika, I just saw this post ... did you happen to actually get in this trade short? This one tanked pretty hard like 100 pips .. hope you caught some of those pips.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Looks like this pair maybe settting up for a BORC trade. The price is at confluence of two lines and is hesistating around this zone. Keep an eye on this one for now

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi! PP, as per your pdf. in the last page, you say do not trade dead trading time 2 am.-7am (est) that is London session right. What is this reason. Thaks.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
The PDF says not to trade 2pm to 7 PM EST. The 2am to 7am is possibly the best time to trade, as you have mentioned this is the London session.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
As this is Friday lunchtime, and things wil be dead soon and I don't hold positions over the weekend .. I am out the rest of my position audusd at 0.9925 for +40 pips on this last 2/3.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I would like to thank Pure Price for the tread and the time you have put in. I am almost new to forex trading (about 12 months) and interested in no indy way of doing things. I have read the tread and the PDF and will do so again over the weekend. I'm down in NZ so missed you last night may have to change my sleep time lol

Hi from Spain ¡¡¡ Congratulations Pure Price. Very good job. I´m doing something very very similar. I hope to be helpful Regards

Pureprice! nothing is happening when I drag the EA into the chart? it doesnt active? I get no setting poping up? nothing? please help someone! I need this

--- 帖子 #159 ---
It is an indicator not an EA. You have to drop it at the indicators folder and attach to chart after restarting your terminal.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
hi roughtrader, this is an indi /not an ea/,so you should put it to your platform/experts/indicators folder and reopen mt4,it will show you the pivot and sr levels...

--- 帖子 #161 ---
This setup is looking great - fantastic down trend on the dailys., a head and shoulder pattern on the 4 hr and its just broken out...wait for a retrace to the neck line and bingo...sell the house

--- 帖子 #162 ---
redart007 very well, I agree with you

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi, I red this thread I like it, and I will start to do exercise and share with you.... Thanks to PP and Lika. Bye NemoMax

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thanks this is looking like a better neck line

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Great setup redart ... I am in short eurchf on a berish englufing candle on the 1HR chart ..

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I am long usdcad ... I had to drp my daughter off to school and had a limit buy order around the line and loks like it has been triggered in my absence ... her eis the chart

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I am short this pair on hourly chart (as indicated by lika in earlier posts . thank Lika)

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Just becuase 1.0000 is such a strong figure, I am out 1/2 my USDCAD long position for +35 pips on this 1/2 of position. Moved rest to BE

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Out the other 1/2 posiiton at 1.0015 as price is bumping against an short-term hourly downtrend line

--- 帖子 #170 ---
this pair just rocketed to 1.0040 which is daily R1 . oh well, I guess I went out too prematurely.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi PP, great, strategy.... I already tried USDCAD... it was great.... Thanks Take look on EURGBP. Cheers

--- 帖子 #172 ---
thanks! I got it to work now but it doesn't look like pureprice's pics, it more looks like Lika's pic, I thought the trendlines would be drawn automaticly? maybe I missunderstod?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Glad that worked out for you Nemo .. Keep up the god work. I will take a look at urgbp .. I know it has broken down hard on hourly. I will look for retrace levels, and highter time frames to see where it is headed. what are your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi PP, I already open short after the Pivot at 0.8610, I got the TP 1/3 at S1 (0.8550) and move SL at BE. Im waiting the 2/3 TP at S2. Bye

--- 帖子 #175 ---
That is wonderful .. I completely missed this one.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Maybe setting up for another bull run after the quick retrace down from 1.0060 to 1.0005 .. currently looking like a pinbar may be forming, but we have to wait for the 12 pm candle to close.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks PP, I will let you know if I will find something other......... Cheers

--- 帖子 #178 ---
we have our pinbar candle close. wait for PA to confirm and enter long for 30 pips

--- 帖子 #179 ---
We could have a BORC setup at 0.9950 . watch PA around that level

--- 帖子 #180 ---
BORC setup may ocur around 1.5950 level

--- 帖子 #181 ---
looks liek eurjpy is finally moving down our way (in profit +20) , however, eurchf is moving against us here for about -20 pips also. I have my SL set at 12940 on the eurchf which is about 50 pips

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I DON'T really like what the eurchf is doing now .. price is not dropping at all now. I did go down to 1.2865 however it has rallied to 12920 since then, and that is where it is at now. that is the level it has to break through (I need to see an hourly bulish candle and close above 12920) for me to exit for a loss

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi PP, First of all, very nice thread, one of most valuable I saw on FF. I was stopped on this today as well This could be better chance on the same pair ... look btw: green pips to all of you guys here

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I am still short, as this pair has not yet proved itself bullish to me yet. It is stil somewhat struggling at the 12920-12940 level which is our short zone. so I am hanging onto this one until 12940, as the 3pm candle just closed, and it was not that convincing either way

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Looks like a reasonable confluence of two lines .. maybe another chance to short this pair again ... However I am still in this one short and have not exited yet

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I am now short audusd at 0.9970

--- 帖子 #187 ---
here is the hourly chart for the trade

--- 帖子 #188 ---
GBPUSD 1HR

--- 帖子 #189 ---
here is the chart

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi PP, also me I still waiting for close in loss this short trade, bacause in TF H4 trend is still short..... still waiting..... Good trade guys

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi PP, Take care on this pair , because you are in no trade hour, right? (2pm - 7pm est). It's dangerous..... Price took your resistence 4 times and also your support, from my side im not sure which way it will take... Bye

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi, I've got on this pair the 2nd / 3 of my short trade at S1 at 0.8514, now I keep to ride the last /3, I will move other 20pips after BE my SL. Thank PP. Bye P.S. still hard in EurChf.... but Im waiting with my short position.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi PP, PA near to your setup ....... ready to go Long (but still waiting for confirmation). Bye

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I am watching this one as well... there is news out of US at 10:00 in about 10 minutes, so be careful of this... this may help the setup or completely blow through it.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Also PA is hitting S1 in addition to the 2 line confluence ... It would be great if news out of USA is btter than expected to drive this pair up fundamentally + our nice setup so we can go long here

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Ok, Thanks It was better to wait...... for the moment..... Thanks PP

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi guys, watch this closely, nice pinbar is forming within nice channel + R3 level + R/S line + High stopping volume (red bar in histogram) watch for PA closely

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Yep, better be out of the market than in the market with a loss. That is where patience pays off sometimes. I am sure there wil be other setups to come all week. I am looking at AUDUSD and EURJPY for now.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Thanks Kapybara ... nice confluence at this level for a possible short setup.. However to clarify to the audience, this is NOT a BORC setup as I can see this is a channel trade. Can you pleae confirm?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Connfirmed, channel trade.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thanks for confirming .. I would wait for the candle to close and confirm price action before juming in short .. it seems that the uadusd rally is on a roll for now.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Maybe happening now... watch closely

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Did anyone short this pair?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Now that this pair ploughed right through our support zone around 0.9960 down to the 0.9900 figure, we should be looking to SHORT this pair if it retraces back to the 0.9950 zone again (this would be old support turned into resistance zone) .. there is confluence of 2 trendlines there ... do you see it?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
No

--- 帖子 #206 ---
PP careful because it seems to me that EURCHF, Long Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi, yes I did, I agree with you..... possible setup for go Short at your PA. Thanks bye

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Lika, I agree with you about this pairs (in TF H1), for me we are near to go Long, but im still waiting..... Cheers P.S. PP take care with this pairs (also me before I thought that was short but Lika has reason for my opinion...)

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I already went short at 1.2965 and cashed some of my position out at teh trendline you are indicating. I have 1/2 remaining and SL set to BE

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I see it now as possible long with 2 trendline confluence on hourly .. God catch guys .. I am out the rest of my position on this one.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Here is what I see on my charts

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Looks like this is a good place to short eurgbp as there is confluence of a horizontal old support turned resistance and a down trendline (channel) where price is hitting the upper boundary of the down channel ... I know it is past 2pm EST, but what the heck . let's see how this plays out

--- 帖子 #213 ---
PA is also right to Pivot Point and looks to be stuggling to go above it (for now)

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Is anyone actually placing orders using this methed (I presume it is on demo account not live) and keeping track of their trades?? If so, how are you doing so far in terms of profit/loss??

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I agree with you, im ready to going short again on this pairs.... but Im waiting tomorrow morning (GMT time). Now it's too dangerous... Cheers

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi PP, from my side I already started yestarday in live but in same time Im doing exercise in other demo account, I took in real around 50 pips in EurGbp already, and now it's on going a trade short on EurJpy from 10am gmt (but at moment I'm in Loss 25Pips, but Im optimist). I will let you know.... Bye

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi guys, pls, consider this as small warning in deciding taking that order. Look at my chart and decide. There is another channel (thin lower blue TL) you can see how many times it was respected by price. I would definitely try to wait for square ("BORC?") place to watch PA closely. And agree w/ you NemoMax, 2:00 PM is not the right time. Just my 2 cents :-) Green pips guys.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
WOW Nemo, you are quite brave trading this live already, and congrats on the 50 pips on eurgbp --- Are you in europe as you are trading gmt time??

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks PP, right.... Im in Italy with gmt trading time, but how I explained Im also doing exercise in demo account for the other pairs.... like you.... Cheers P.S. Let me know if you starting also in Live

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi PurePrice, I am coming full circle in my evolution of forex trading. I started out with learning the basics of PA, then fell into the indicator trap for a good couple of dark months / year, and now I am finally accepting the fact that PA is really the only true way to go. Thank you for posting your setups and analysis and please do not stop. I may not reply as often as I should but I have been following this thread religiously since you started it. Thank you taking the time and effort to help us. I really appreciate what you are doing here. Cheers StaticX

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I am glad you are back into PA and not putting too much weight on indicators. I am also glad that I may be doing something positive to help someone in their trading .. yours and similar messages is what keeps me going -- thanks for your feedback.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
This one is now coming into play by watching how PA is falling down now. As mentioned in earlier posts, this is a CHANNEL TRADE wih some nice confluence. There are a couple hours before Tokyo open, so you may want to keep an eye on this one for an Asian session play.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
keep an eye on: 1- eurgbp for a short 2- eurchf for a long (although that is opposite position to 1-, so be careful) 3- gbpchf for a long 4- usdcad for a short 5- gbpusd for a long (as mentioned yesterday too) and of course audusd, but that one is so close to triggering short (channel trade)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
uhm, if this audusd pair break down happens in the next few candles, and you go to the 4hr chart, you will see that there would be a great BORC setup to go long again around 0.9930-50 zone if the currency keeps sliding down that far. It is a long shot, but hey, better be ready for these things if they do happen

--- 帖子 #225 ---
here is the 4hr audusd chart .. look at the yellow triangle

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I see this pair now is bumping against the uptrend channel's lower boundary after it had broken down from it ... This may also be a great eurusd SHORT BORC setup ... Draw your uptrend line and watch it closely at the current levels

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Good night everyone and happy pip hunting for those that are able to hunt during Asian, Euro and London sessions ... I wil be back during NY tomorow ...

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi PP, I've got 30 pips with EurGbp Short this morning at S1, yestarday closed EurJpy Loss 25Pips. Cheers

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi PurePrice, Thank you very much for this thread, I like simplicity of your trading style. I hope I will contribute something with my analysis. Here is screen with a situation on GBPJPY. It is not one of the easiest pairs to trade but I think this chart is worth having a look. On the bigger scale (D1, H4) we are trending downward, but after a good, healthy breakout out of this area (and nice pullback of course) we could have plenty of room to make pips on H1 before it turns south again. Thanks once again and let's search together for the best opportunities. Cheers, Chris

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi Chris; I'm watching your setup, but with a slight difference. because I'm already anticipating an pulback to test the trendline Blue indicated by red arrows, and the 132,000 level. Cheers Lika Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi Lika, Yes there is slight difference in our approach. Why I have my zone little higher is that I want to be sure that the three previous highs will be taken out and this sets me around 132.50 to wait for pull back . Cheers

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I just want to welcome you to the thread, and thanks for your feedback and for posting setups.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I got about 30 on eurgbp as well. Also lost on the eurjpy pair, but that is what trading is all about, you can NOT win them all. you try to pick the best possible setup with the highest probability of winning, and hope the market will react the same but there is never any guarantee that will happen, and tht is why you should always limit your loss and let your profits win, so that at the end of the month you come ahead. I will update the other pairs as soon as I have another chance.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi PP, Thanks, I will let you know if I will see other chance also. Cheers

--- 帖子 #235 ---
These 2 pairs are setting up for a possible BORC trade on hourly chrts .. watch PA closely

--- 帖子 #236 ---
these 2 pairs are breaking out of channels currently and may rally up a bit then retrace.. look for those pars to setup a BORC in a few hours if the breakout continues.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
watch this

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thank you for posting this chart. I normally do not monitor this pair at all as I monitor eurusd instead as thee two pairs are so correlated (negatively) it is like an exact mirror image of each other

--- 帖子 #239 ---
did not have many setups to trade today. Did anyone trade any of the recommendations last night? There were a few successful ideas such as eurgbp for about 30 pips eurchf for about 30 gbpchf for 100 pips and of course audusd short for about 60 pips

--- 帖子 #240 ---
hourly longs on those 2 pairs .. SL and TP are quite small

--- 帖子 #241 ---
hourly long BORC setups on eurchf and gbpchf. Again the breakouts were small, so I expect small TP and SL

--- 帖子 #242 ---
same short trade setup we had twice before on the upper boundary of a downtrend channel.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
News out of kiwi land was bad for the nzd .. so it went down sharply. Cancel long on this one.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hmmm, after looking closer at this pair, I see that it went down sharply, as mentioned earier, but now stalling at the channel, see "blue arrow" for setup. Watch this pair

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi PurePrice, I am still long on the EURUSD, due to a a couple of factors: 1. trend line break 2. Trend Line break is smack bang in the middle of the Daily average range for the pair. 3. The 4H timeframe is trending in the same direction at the moment. My SL is very tight, 16pips and my TP is 50pips (+- 1.38544) I am using a trade manager as it's getting late and I am going to let this trade run it's course. TM will automatically adjust my SL as the trade (hopefully) moves in profit. Could you critique this trade and let me know if I have miss-analysed it? Cheers StaticX

--- 帖子 #246 ---
It is all good analysis, BUT, this is certainly not a BORC setup as you described, it is a TL breakout. So far, we do not trade breakouts in this thread. We trade the retrace (pulback) to the breakout zone.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi PurePrice, Ok, my bad. (It's super late here and my brain is starting to shutdown) If I were to follow a BORC setup, should I have waited for the price to pullback to the trendline, then watched for the continuation? (say on a lower timeframe for an optimized entry) Cheers StaticX

--- 帖子 #248 ---
yes Static, that is the premise of this method

--- 帖子 #249 ---
PurePrice, if PA likely stalls out down here it might be because the asian PPMs realize they will make more money by not shorting it further down, but by waiting for the euro PPMs to hike the price back up for their round of shorting it down.. and the asian PPMs will again short it back down with them. With all the USD High Impact releases coming, and spread hours apart, there will be plenty of time for everyone, after the PPMs hike the price, to build short positions again for another strong leg down later. Already the PA/Volume study from late yesterday shows the PPMs loaded up at the top and on the first drive down from the top. So, it is not unreasonable that there might be another price hike and more of the same today, with the USD High Impact releases being the catalyst.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi PP, I think, we have to wait that Trichet speaks today at 13,30 / 14,00 GMT, because maybe something change for Interest rate (maybe decide for push up it).... we waiting.... Cheers

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi Guys, There is an interesting situation on gold. On H1 price made nice SHS, touched downward trendline 4 times and now is stuck in the range showed on the chart. If price spikes through the trendline north I will be interested to play pullback either back to TL or more preferably to upper zone of the range 1343-1345. That would be countertrend trade on H1 but with trend on D1. Let's see if on bigger scale gold resumes trend or continue correction. SHS pattern makes trend continuation more propable. Cheers, Chris

--- 帖子 #252 ---
These two pairs worked well, and if you were to let profits run on these pairs, you would have made some handsome pips.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Went down about 60 pips

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Still hanging out at the previous resistance (may turn suport) level , although with Tricket speaking, any technicals may go out the window .. keep a close eye on this one

--- 帖子 #255 ---
This one is still hanging out at the 0.77 figure and has not gone thru our old resistance (which we hope to turn into support) .. we may still get the reversal we are waiting for here .. keep an eye on this one

--- 帖子 #262 ---
These two pairs reversed nicely as expected, let's see if they continue up now. I am long both pairs

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Since price is at R1 and previous resistance .. I am out 1/2 for +35 pips

--- 帖子 #264 ---
HOURLY possible BORC setup here .. watch PA for candle formation, and hopefully reverse up and PA continuation up.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Long gbpusd on the hourly

The move down for the eur maybe axhausted. WAtch the eurchf setup gain at these levels ... at your own risk Attachment

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Big thanks PP

--- 帖子 #268 ---
maybe stopping and reversing at the boundary of the CHANNEL .. this is a channel trade setup .. so if you feel like taking some risk and with how the EUR is being sold now, taking a long trade is risky... proceed with caution

--- 帖子 #269 ---
you are welcome Lika .. it is nice to see you are still following this thread

--- 帖子 #270 ---
more a trendline to converge. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Good call Lika. More reason to long this pair when you get your candle formation followed by PA confirmation.. but agian be cautious as Market is crazy now and you may wish to wait until is settles down, and Tokyo opens

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I am satisfied with +80 pips on this half -- out the res on this one. I am also out nzdusd as this one is running inot resistance and out of steam for about +30 pips

--- 帖子 #273 ---
as expected, tomorrow is NFP day and traders are waiting out till they se what NFP brings tomorrow at 8:30 EST There are many good setups now, but with NFP tomorrow who knows what that wil bring .. so if you are inot any trades, make sure you tighten your stops or take pfits before the news comes out .. there are many LONG BORC setups, such as : EurJpy GbpJpy GbpUsd EurChf EurGbp Channel trade (this is at lower end of down channel)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
How is the GBP/USD trade going on Pureprice?I haven't seen an update for this trade yet.Are you still holding it?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thanks for joining us Wira. This trade got stopped out for -25 pips

--- 帖子 #276 ---
took this one long, and it is just at breakeven now ... I am exiting this one

--- 帖子 #277 ---
this one surely bounced off the BORC setup and now 60 pips in profit. Exiting before NFP

--- 帖子 #278 ---
This one alos bounced off the boundary of the down channel. I am exiting this long for +30 pips near the upper boundary of the channel and before release of NFP.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
now that we are about 10 minutes away from the biggest news event of the month, be cautious with your positions. either square them, or tighten your stops, just in case if the news goes against you you will end up with a small loss. If you do not square off your positions, and if the news goes your way, you will win big if you decide to tighten stop and let the trade run. We now wait for this release

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I have to drop daughter off at school and will be back after 9:00 am

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Well, NFP was down considerable and much worse than expected, however, employment numbers were better than expected ... Let the market digest this over the next 1/2 hour and we wil look to see if there are any formations we like at the close of the 9:00 am candle. This should take most of the steam out of the news. At 10:00 however, there is high imapct IVEY PMI out of Canada, so be cautious trading this pair at 10:00 candle open as that will likely have an effect on the direction that candle goes (at least initially). Please look for setups (and post them here if you like) as we wait out the next 30 minutes or so. I am seeing eurchf going short at top of channel and previous horizontal support/resistance. Also USDCAD going long at bottom of channel, BUT as mentioned above there is news at 10:00 .,. so wait this one out and se if news out of Canada will help the price bounce up.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
in USDCAD long at 0.9860

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Out 1/2 at even 0.9900 (for +40 pips) as this is also the Pivot Point for the day. Next 1/2 TP is at the upper end of channel

--- 帖子 #284 ---

as above .. there is confluence of two lines, the big round figure of 1.3000 and that level is also R1 for the day ... hope it tanks from here

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I also have 1.34 as a possible rejection zone for a BORC setup long.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Can't wait much longer and have exited my second 1/2 around 0.9890 (+30 pips)

Hi there Pure Price, What do you think of AU on H4 timeframe? Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi PP; how to set your SL? For example here in this pair? Cheers Lika

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Nice setup, however, I do not think there is enough of a breakout above the line to make it worth it. There is just not enough "juice" in this setup to make it worth it on a 4HR frame. On hourly I look for about 50+ pips of a break. On a 4HR, I would look for around 200 (4*50) pips minimum.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Lika, Normally, if we wait for a candle formation to confirm reversal, then I would set my SL just (+10/-10 pips or so) above/below the candle. I also look at Fractals to see where the last minor support/resistance is at, and set my SL just above/below the fractal up/down... I then adjust the SL as the trade develops (personal preference). In this particular example of eurchf, I am setting my SL at 1.3010

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I should add that you should also account for the Spread so my spread is 3 pips now, and my SL is set at 1.3013

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Depending what you are risking on the trade and if you can digest a bigger draw down and want to stay in teh trade a bit longer to see it develop . Another more distant SL would be at the last swing high, which in this case would be aroun 1.3037 +10 pips, i.e 1.3047+3 for spread. So if you want to be more aggressive and have a wider SL, I would set it at 1.3050. If you cannot stomach the drawdown, I would set it at 1.3013.

--- 帖子 #295 ---

Hi PurePrice, I"ve downloaded your manual and the indicator (the one on page 1) and would like to test and learn the way. But could you tell how to run the indicator as it does not on my platform. Thanks

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hello Yards, Please place the indicator file in your experts/indicator folder. You should restart your MT4 platform, and you will see the AFST indicator in your custom indicators list. Just open any chart, drag the indicator on your chart, accepts the defaults, and Voila. You should then see your Pivot Point, 3 R levels and 3 S levels drawn on your chart.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
As it is getting late on Friday afternoon, I have squared off both my eurjpy (for +30 pips) and eurchf (+11 pips) ... I do not like to hold positions open over the weekend, unless it is a longer term trade (daily and above).

Hey PP.... just thought I'd say thanks to you for this thread. Great to see an energetic, positive thread on bonafide trading....I'm in!! The only thing I seem to have some challenges with drawing the same trend lines but am making sense of the system based on retracement and PP action none the less. Thanks for having me. Mike

--- 帖子 #314 ---
See you Monday

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thank you for joing us Mike, and welcome to the thread. Drawing trendlines is a bit subjective and with experience and enough chart time, you will be able to draw those in your sleep -- I basically look to see where price has previously bounced to determine areas of support/resistanace, then draw lines between those points (whether they be horizontal R/S lines or sloped TrendLines) .. If you like, you may use the Fractals indicator to highlight those areas and draw your lines connecting those marks. I normally use Fractals for assistance in setting SL and TP, and sometimes with drawing lines

--- 帖子 #316 ---
While you were posting I was actually downloading a fractals indicator from the online library I had noticed yours and how it helped me envision the TL's. Which fractals indicator are you using? I like the different colors for simplicity. THX Mike

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I just came across your thread from interactive trading thread on "before/after trade chart"...It is nice thread...but i see too much talking...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I am using the one that comes with the MT4 platform (I have FxPro ) .. you can change the colour of the fractal to anything you like.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thanks surewin. Yes, there is talking here, and it is to help viewers understand the method better. If someone doesnot understand, they can certainly ask questions. It is NOT a signal service where only setups are posted... I like to talk and like people to participate. Feel free to do so as well

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I definitely will post some charts here...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Possible short @1.60 after it breaks down its trendline. Looking to retest its 61.8% retracement

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Possible long at 1.3280 area. It will likely takes several days to develop it. Note: Oversold in rsi. Nice doji candle. 38.2% retracement. Previous resistance now become support.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
eurgbp mite takes a week or two develop long position. Likely it will test 0.830 area or slightly lower then bounce back.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I short audnzd @1.3170...I would expect to retrace back into 38.2% retracement or trendline area in the blue

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I expect dollar expect will keep the fuel up to rally into 78.80-79.10 area which is big resistance there. Then it will likely to take the break. If dollar index get theres, eu drop to 1.3470 area and gu drop to 1.5920-50 area...I will look to long the EU, GU position.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Possible setup for EJ if eur/usd didn't find support around 1.3470 area.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
fantastic thread, PP. Hope others see the value in your confluences, as it does work. Personally I thrive on TL failures, and flips, and it seems you do much of the same.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thank u for your posts surewin ... I do not monitor most of the exotic pais, so you compliment that perfectly. and you look for 4h setups, I am more of a 1 hr setup kindda guy

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Welcome Qwerty. Wish you much success with this method and your own method.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I do not normally log online on Saunday, but here I am ... I just cheked my potential setups from Friday, and they are all still valid ... Should wait till Tokyo open to see if anything exciting develops. I assume tonight is a slow night, and things will get exciting as EU and London open. However, AUD has news coming out in 75 minutes that may move the AUD and NZD pairs. So keep a close eye on the audusd and nzdusd pairs for confirmation or failure of our potential long setups.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
over the weekend, here we are again, I wish you all a week of many positive pips Lika

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Only today did I see that your post, because I really was already in bed. sometimes you can see me online, but because my computer is on, it has no rest Cheers Lika 23:27 GMT+1 was.............

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Close audnzd for +10 pips gain. News is coming for Aussie. Even i think it will at least drop to 1.31 area first.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Short eurchf @1.2960. I would expect pull back into 50% retracement or 38.2% retracement for it. Trading Rule: 1. Discard the setup if it doesn't triggered before 3:00pm EST. 2. Move SL to breakeven after gain the 50 pips. 3. Close 50% of position after reach 100 pips gain. 4. Move you SL to 200ma in 15min chart as new SL after reached 100pips gain. 5. Close all profit positions after 1:00pm on Friday. Don't want to carry winning trade over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks Surewin, but I am unsure about your setup and the reason why you are taking this trade .. remember we are interested in BORC setups here only, so please keep it to that setup

--- 帖子 #336 ---
News hour candle ended up as a doji, and now the next candle is looking bullish. Maybe starting to turn bullish ... let's wait for the close of this candle to decide.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Nice bullish candle close ... I would watch PA for a few min and jump in Long if it continues up

--- 帖子 #338 ---
oh...sorry...My setup based on trendline, resistance, fib and ichimoku setup. I guess I won't post my trade setup here since it is not BORC setup...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Guys, I'm still waiting for gold. It broke out nicely, piercing through TL and s/r around 1344-45. Now it is making a pullback to this zone but I'm still waiting for proper PA. I prefer to have a perfect set up than to take C or B trade. Tread cautiously because it is f!@#ing treacherous, a trap is everywhere I wish you tons of pips. Cheers, Chris

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thanks for a great post and the pdf. Nice to see something I have seen other experienced traders use and explained so succinctly. Really appreciated

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Thanks for posting this setup Chris. I appreciate the assistance with these trades as I do not monitor every pair myelf, and I do not trade gold. I hope this trade turns into a AAA setup for you and Many pips to you

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thank you drcharlz. I am glad you find this method clear and I hope you can use it as a trading tool. Good luck

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thank you for your understanding. I just do not wish to confuse readers with different setups that are not explained clearly in this thread. You may post BORC setups anytime you wish. I sometime post chanel trades as well (but not so much).

--- 帖子 #344 ---
guys and gals, Be aware mr. Trichet is speaking at 9:00 am today so that may cause some action in EUR.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Many Eur pairs I follow...seems one last push to lower before rally backup.. I might favor on bearish side when he speaks, but i won't trade on the NEWs.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Do anyone has idea on JPY pairs going? I'm seeing very confusing on many JPY pairs...

--- 帖子 #347 ---
We don't normally speculate, we trade the BORC

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Did anyone take of the BORC setups from Friday/Sunday??? .. if so, can you please give an update on your trades?????

--- 帖子 #349 ---
euchf, I gained 32 pips, very good Thanks PP Lika

--- 帖子 #350 ---
here is the chart

--- 帖子 #351 ---
That is terrific Lika. It seems most of the EUR setups worked, especially eurjpy to the tune of about 80 pips. AUDUSD and NZDUSD now running into profit

--- 帖子 #352 ---
potential BORC setup, although the breakout wasnot that far and not as clean as I like but this may still be a good setup as it went up about 60 pips before retracing to the current level ... Let's watch PA closely here is the chart

--- 帖子 #353 ---
here is the chart ...

--- 帖子 #354 ---
here is the hourly chart for a potential BORC setup

--- 帖子 #355 ---
hourly chart setup ...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
What about this trendline (yellow)? important?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I do not normally trade daily TF, but this one looks good for someone who is inot daily TF and can stomach a large SL but a large TP as well. Looks like this pair is unable to get above 0.9600 mark for now, and may drop further is this resistance area holds well. Keep an eye on this one for a bearish candle formation followed by bearish PA to get in short.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I see the TL as below.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
s&amp;p future seems going to crack down from here. It forms negative divergence in 1hr and bearish candle as well. If s&amp;p did crack down, JPY should show the strength. It will be bad for JPY pairs. I would expect BIG sell off in next 2-3 days.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi , Thanks PurePrice, I will try to post some valueable setups from time to time. As for the set-up, I have finally taken long trade. After the pullback to the 1344-45 zone (dark-blue) I was waiting for good PA and I have found it on H4, it was an outside bar (4bars embraced by 1- light-blue area). I have decided to play on breakout of this range. I had a bullish sentiment after the market formed SHS and broke out through the major TL. I want to exit with the first part around 1371-72 (one2one formation, important s/r ) and trail the rest watching for HH and HL. I expect here that gold will resume daily trend. That would be the best scenario but you never know. Maybe it is just a correction within a correction. Cheers, Chris

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Nice setup Chris. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
It seems the dollar index likely going to pull back tonight as you see in the chart. For aggressive trader, I would favor long eurusd, nzdusd...but make sure scalp out with 50pips SL...I think dollar index has more room to upside once it break out its congestion area. For me, I would prefer to short it when it pull back especially on eurusd.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
usdchf is pulling back to the previous resistance level (may become new support) at 0.9600 ... looks like price is hesitating and may bounce back up

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Well the candle closed as doji and that is a good indication of indicision at this point. Let's see if the bulls can pull the price

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Here is the trade

--- 帖子 #366 ---
stopped out for -20 pips

--- 帖子 #367 ---
hi PP and all i have a question, is the trend line i draw valid? and the should wait to buy?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I would be caution on SHORTING $ pair.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
The line is valid, and yes, you would wait for a buy now. However, please note that 9 hours prior to this we had a bounce from the same area at 7700 to 7740 .. so be careful

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I think s&amp;p will start cracking down tomorrow which will be negative for JPY pairs. Many JPY pairs likely go to top out very soon... I personally like to short eurjpy and gbpjpy which will have more leg upside likely...

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I still suspect dollar index have one more pull bk to its 38.2% retracement before its uptrend continue. I would like to short gbpusd, eurusd on its rally on us session.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
...bought ej @112.76 sl @112.57...

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Nice setup and it loks liek you are about +35 pips in profit right now.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
thanks pp!,im out @113.10 near recent top and long on eu @1.3597 right now... sl@1.3573

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hey pureprice and others. Have been a lurker for quite some time and I like this thread. Thanks for the active thread. I Will be surely contributing if i find something.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I like this setup also around the 1.3600 level as it is doublezero, two trendlines meeting and the bottom of the daily ATR.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Sorry guys and gals I have not been posting so much as I have been busy at work and do not have time to watch the platform. I work 9 to 6 NY time and that is when I also trade and post. I would hope that other viewers can post ther setups whenever they can (preferably before teh trade takes place) ... thanks. Note I am also working on a couple more strategies that compliment this one and hope to post those in the next couple of weeks .. stay tuned

--- 帖子 #378 ---
It is really great to have you join us, and thank you for your feedback. We are all looking forward to your contributions.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
yes,bottom of the channel and rejection from 61.8 fib of recent swing high,little bit too early but sl set already be+1...

--- 帖子 #380 ---
If anyone is following this trade .. we had a Doji candle closing then followed a Pinbar candle, which was a good formation to take this trade Long. Now the current candle is very bullish, so let's hope for nice number of pips up. 1.3645 is first TP

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Better be out at BE than a big loss the trade has moved about 30 pips already so it is a good time to lock in as it is also goign to be lunch time in NY soon and things just die down form that point on normally

--- 帖子 #382 ---
watch PA here

--- 帖子 #383 ---
No worries. Just don't dump the thread please. it's good stuff here. Still clean and nice and free from indys. I hate indicators that keep repaitning and giving BS trades And yes i, for one, would wait for more strategies.

s&amp;p future seems has one last push up before dropping. meaning JPY pairs has one more push up as well. 1375 area is key resistance for s&amp;p future where it is 78.6% retracement.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
$ index going to hit BIG resistance around 79. It already broke its asending triangle in 4hr chart. Is it going to retrace to its support area? Is it keep going up with taking a break? I don't know. I rather trade on its break out and its support area. I would favor on short side on $ index. I would think audusd, nzdusd is good long canditation once $ hits 79 with one more push up. On the short side usdchf, gbpchf.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Guys and Gals, As I am not having enough time to post hourly or shorter time frame setups, starting next week I will be doing 4HR and Daily chart setups instead. Those will likely come at/after close of the trading day in NY (so basically 5 pm EST). If I see 4HR setups, I will likely post them at lunch time (1-2 pm) or so as that is my lunch hour at work. Additionally, I will likely post more trade setups than just BORC. This likely include Channel and Trendline trades, which would compliement BORC, in the sense that we do not wait for a breakout, retrace and continuation. We will just trade the rejection of the price at the trendline or channel bounadries. Again all of these trades are pure price action based trades. In rare cases, I will also trade the actual breakout, hesitation, continuation pattern if the setup conditions are there (more to come on this one next week). Given the aforementioned, the setups will be far less than on the hourly or 15-minute charts and will involve setting up a much larger SL and TP targets. However if you have some time to watch the screen in between setups, you can trade the hourly or a 5-minutes the same exact way we trade the 4HR and Daily setups. Please post our setups if you can. The Bonus, I am working on a 5-minute trading method that requires you to scalp the market, which will be a great addition to this strategy if you can afford screen time, while waiting for onger term setups. This method is best traded during the first three hours of EU/London/NY sessions as that is when the market has most volume. I should have ready sometime in the middle of next week or the start of the week after. Would anyone be interested in this way of trading???? I would like for us to keep track of our trades somehow to see if these methods are successful an actually worth spending time trading them. All I can think of is that every weekend we can get a report from our MT4 statement and post it to show the track record. We can all open a $10,000 demo account and trade it for the next few months, starting say March 1st? May be we can even have two accounts, one for longer term setups and one for scalping. Is there a better way to keep track of account performance?? Good luck and I await your feedback.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
for keeping track purpose, i think there are many sites like mt4pips.com, myfxbook.com

Currently price at previous support and hesitating by forming double doji candles at the 1.3500 level. Please note that my magenta lines are H4 and my cyan lines are Daily R/S or trend lines.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
here is the setup for a possible bounce up next week. watch PA at the current level. it is previous resistance on 4 H and upchannel boundary on the daily

--- 帖子 #400 ---
here is the setup ... confluence of 2 lines for a BORC setup. However be aware of daily resitance (cyan line) just above

--- 帖子 #401 ---
here is the chart .. watch PA next week to see if we get a nice bullish daily candle formation to go long at the bottom of the chanel. OR, if we get a really bearish candle, look to trade the breakout

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Good stuff here. Thanks. I was watching same stuff in EU and wondering if my analysis is valid. Even GU i agree there is major support but i am worried if it will hold. thats another system so lets not worry about that. Lets see what happens.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
confluence of uptrend channel line which price has reraced back to and previous resistance (triple top) .. this one is worth watching next week after we are over the weekend. I was short this one and closed it before the weekend. MAy jump back in short again on Monday if we see favourable Price Action down.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Well, the idea is that we let the market show its cards before we play. So, if the level holds we will "predict" (although really you never know) by the candle formation and hopefully some follow through PA before we can take a position. If the level does not hold and the price ploughs through the level, so be it. We will NOT trade the bounce, and may actually trade the Break just be patient and let the market tell us which way it wants to go first. I KNOW this way we are not getting in the position at the best possible price, but this way we will stay out of a complete and totally illogical entry which will result in a loss. I would rather be out of the market with a flat position than in the market with a losing position. WE will not catch 100% of the move this way, but we may be able to catch 70%, with a smaller chance of failing (hopefully).

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Price is at the top of a channel which may get rejected next week and tank down to the bottom end of the channel. Again wait for price to form a closed candle on daily before you go in. It may stil breakout of the chanel next week. We will wait patiently to see how this will playout Here is the chart ...

--- 帖子 #406 ---
That's at heart of trading.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Again magenta lines are H4 and cyan lines are daily. On H4, we have a traingle formation that is begging to be broken one way or another now (very likely to the upside). We will play the breakout if it happens. on Daily there maybe a BORC setup if price goes down and retraces to the 1.3050 zone

--- 帖子 #408 ---
This may be ways away yet but we may get a nice BORC setup here where there is confleunce od 3 lines plus the huge 1.0000 number. Keep an eye on this level next week

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Looking to go Long next week on the Trendline trade as indicated, if we get favourable PA. Looks liek today's candle may close as a doji, indicating indecision at end of today .. le us wait till next week to see where PA will take us.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
WOW, there is plenty of setups to watch next week. This normally does nto happen with such a large timeframe, but hey, we are getting lucky -- please keep an eye on those setups and if you would like to report your trades that woudl be gret so we can all learn from each other. I will try to follow up on those setups and post here as much as I can, and hope other viewers will try to do the same. Remeber to use and SL that is far enough not to get taken out too quickly, but close enough not to lose too much more than 1-2% on each trade Also remember that some currency pairs are positively or negatively correlated and taking positions in those currencies at teh same time means increasing your exposure and risk and you should take that into account when calculating your 1-2% risk. i.e. if you take a long position in eurusd and short position in usdchf at the same time, it is "almost" the same as doubling your position in either of those 2. Well, that is my 2 cents for the week. I am signing off and wishing you all a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Thanks Razif .. have you used these sites before? Which one do you prefer ? Are they easy to setup?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
In regarding JPY short, I like eurjpy setup Vs gbpjpy. 23.6% + Trendline + Negative Divergence

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I have different view on eurjpy long. I think we mite see some pull back. Time will us which direction will be heading to.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
surewin, how do you get the URL link to your "Live Trade Log" to show up in your posts. I want to use MT4pips to post my demo trading performnace record and want to publish that here

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I already closed this and would wait until next week to see where this is headed as well. Have a good weekend

Dollar index broke out its ascending triangle. let's if it has MORE GAS pushing into 79.24 which is 161.8% retracement.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Thanks PP for the great insight.. Yes i have used both, mt4pips is easier and come with EA installer which will be used for tracking. Myfxbook however have more analysis detail like Sharpe ratio and z-score and doesn't need EA to track the trade. I personally prefer myfxbook.

Guys, It took too much time for me to update individual positions. Here is my live trade updates from my account.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thank you surewin.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Good call on this one .. I exited before the weekend, and I am glad I did

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Just checked inot the potenitals trades. I Did not take any positions so far, as really none of the pairs had a favourable formation and follow though. However a couple of the setups failed, and I may be looking to trade some breakout setups. Will update in the next few posts

--- 帖子 #424 ---
failed the 4H setup with no follow through on th eprice action. NOW at the daily previous resistance level (may turn support) at the 13450 level. this level we marked a while ago as a potential BORC setup .. let's now see if we get the formation and follow though we hope for a bounce here.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
4HR breakout of the triangle did not work and price actually respected the upper resistance line and dived right down to the proximity of the old resistance level (may become support) .. let's see if we get a bullish formation around the levels marked on the chart.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
buy @ 3430, daily tl &amp; res.around 3425...also 4H channel low...

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Waiting for confirmation on PA to go long here, as we get a bullish 4H candle on the previous candle. Sam seems to get in at the best price but does not wait for formation or confirmation. so depends on your style of trading and risk tolerance, you can go either way

--- 帖子 #428 ---
this pair is now at the zone of interest ... we are hoping for a bounce up from these levels. I will wait for candle pattern formation and PA confirmation before goign long this pair.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Please check back in around 5 PM for daily setups as it looks liek we may have a couple of interesting setups here. USDCAD is bouncing up off the botom of the channel, and USDCHF is rejected at the top of the channel. NZDUSD, EURGBP and GBPUSD are also interesting at these levels . stay tuned....

--- 帖子 #430 ---
WOW, looks like this one just got rejected for about 30 pips already... let's see if this H4 candle will continue to form bullish, and I may enter long at the 1 PM candle.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I am in this trade with a long position at 1.3480

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Tried this sort of thing, wasnt reliable enough, could not asess TPs and SLs, trend channels and fixed S/R arent reliable enough in my view. Though i use these things for S/R and such, i would not trade it. But i wish you good luck, you might understand something i never did.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Well, it depends how you trade these setups. I normally wait for candle stick pattern formation around the zone of interest followed by PA confirmation. I set my SL just above/below the candle formation, and I move it as the trade develops in my favour. My TP levels are not fixed either, I start with my first TP=SL, and then once my trade develops, I move to to nearest R/S or pivot level, double zero numbers, previous high/low, whatever. I am not very rigid in my SL and TP. The R/S levels are areas of possible reversals that we can look for, but nothing is for sure, and those levels maybe broken especially when there is news. If the levels are broken, we do not trade them as reversals. We may look for a BO trade at that point in time. I normally do not just jump in at those levels before I see the market reaction first. I let the market tell me what it is doing that those zones first and "shows its hand" before I show mine. This is not to say that I will be correct each time, as that would be the holly grail. NO ONE in their right mind would tell you that they know where the market is going in the future, unless they are a furtune teller and we know how truthful these people are ... all we are doing is trying to put the odds and probabilty in our favour and exercise good money management and hope that we have a higher win/loss %, and with our TP being larger than our SL, we come ahead at the end of the month. But again, even with that we may still lose some months.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
the EURCHF setup is loking god for bullish candle pinbar formation at current level (as we were hoping to get) .. if this PA continues in th enext candle (1 pm open) I am will be in Long. EURUSD in not progressing all that fast, but we are a couple pips in profit as we close the current H4 candle and move on to the open of the 1 PM H4 candle.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I kindda missed this setup earlier as I was on the daily chart of the audusd .. however going down to the 4H, I found this short, and I just got in short position.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Here is the trade with initial SL and TP setup, if anyone wonders how I set those up as I enter the trade

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Here is the setup

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Pure, Is it your live account?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I am out with a few pips profit... I do not like PA so much right now, as it looks like USD is getting weak

--- 帖子 #440 ---
no, it is demo .. I use OANDA to trade live .. I just opened this demo to track performance of this method here.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
here is something you might enjoy if you have time to trade 5-minute charts. This is the bonus I promised you last week. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post4397997

--- 帖子 #442 ---
This pair is at bottom of a channel and has form a doji indicating rejection at the zone. Long if PA continues up.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
still watching this one at this zone. No formation to determine direction either way.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
looks like it is forming a doubletop at the zone. We had a bearish daily candle. I have pending SHOR Torder if price continues down

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Still at the zone, and no real indication which way at this point in time, although the candle did close below the trendline, which may signal a breakout to the downside. BUT will need to wait for more signals as the price may go back up again. I am staying on sideline until further clarity. We need the market to show us its hand first

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Still valid for a bounce up as before ... nothing new to update here really

--- 帖子 #447 ---
if we can break below 15950 level, I think we will have a valid BO down.

--- 帖子 #448 ---

Thanks pureprice. I didnt trade it but i was watching your charts and at least didnt get caught on wrong side of bounce. Not losing money is good trade

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Anyone take any traes that they would like to update us on.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
this pair bounced nicely up form the point of entry (1.3485) to go up to 1.3550. My first TP was hit for 65 pips which was also my SL. As my first TP was hit, I moved rest to BE, which was just hit. So total for the trade is 65 pips on 0.3 lots.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
My pending SHORT order as hit @ 9681, just below the daily low of the bearish candle.. it has since went down about 35 pips, but now back up agina to about BE. Keeping this trade pen for the time being with 0.3 lots.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Pending Long order was hit @ 1.3115, and has since retraced back to old daily resistance around 1.3040, just missed my SL by 2 pips. Wil see if this bounces back up agina, or if it will plough through the 1.3040 level. My TP is set at 1.3195

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Here is a trade I have been in since yesterday morning when I saw bullish consolidation turning to the upside. I am targeting the 3600 area.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
on the H4 Price is hitting up against upper boundary of channel and looks to be rejected frming a bearsih candle. Let's ee if we get follow though after opening of the 1 pm candle to go SHORT

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I went short on this one a BO trade.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
There is a possible BO setup here on gbpusd. Here is how I trade a BO 1- Get a nice BO candle with Full Body 2- Following the BO candle you get a hesitation candle with small body 3- Set a pendig order just past the range of the previous 2 candles 4- Exit at close of the following candle if trade triggers.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
SL hit for -75 pips on all 0.3 lots

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hi I notice you don't really use the first and second wick to start your trend lines. Any reason why not?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I traded this BO for 100 pips yesterday. Note the nice BO candle followed by hesitation folowed by another long candle in the same direction as orignal BO for a nice +100 pips

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I use "zones" not specific points. Sometimes I go to a BAR chart as opposed to candle chart and draw the lines, kindda in between the tw sometimes. Again, it is zones or areas we are intereted in, not specific accurate lines.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Agreed you are right that is true. Its all about confluence. By the way nice bo trade. I am still trying to trade these types of b/0's accurately.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
PurePrice, what happend to trading log? I believe www.fxstat.com supports onanda which you could link up your LIVE trading account

--- 帖子 #465 ---
was using MT4pips and it kept mixing up m two acounts that I have with FxPro . I use one account for my BORC method and I use the Other for my PASS method, but this Mt4Pips kept messing up so I took it out. will likely just delete my PASS aconut and move it to another tracker and will repost the trading log back in here again once all that mess is cleared out. In addition, MT4Pips was sooooooo sloooooow

--- 帖子 #466 ---
You could use myfxbook.com which is the one i'm using. I like it, so i could review my trade weekly which trades are bad and good.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Thanks, will try that one as it looks alot better with far more analytical tools that mt4pips.

Here is the chart i posted before I went bed last nite on GU short... If anyone follow, T1 and T2 should be done...I would close t3 as well for 100+ pips gain. Currently I'm long it now. Looking for bouncing up to 1.63.

Is this Su*ker going down today????? I would wait for JPY pairs for one more cycle up. I will be looking to short EJ, GJ and CJ.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
This seems to be the only setup (this was BORC setup) that actually triggered from last night. It worked for 100 pips profit. Still waiting on eurjpy, audusd and usdcad. GBPUSD is now at the boundary of an uptrendline on daily ... look for it to bounce up

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi surewin, so I have myfxbook setp now .. thanks I have th link posted in my signature as you can see, but I would like to make it look like yours. so, in essence I want to chage the name of the link (to say something like Trade Results) and not just show the actual link as I have it now.. Thanks

I decided to add the link to the first post instead as this was confusing my othe thread performace. I think that is the way I will keep it as I have two completely unrelated trading stategies, and I dont want performance to be mized up between the two methods

do you trade on live account as well on the trade as posted or it is just pratice only? Live and Demo account are two different attitude?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Just Demo for practice ... I would never share my Live account information with anyone in public as that is personal and confedential, and I do not trust any tracking site with that information. The point of keeping a log is to see if your method is working, and may track how you are progressing. Are you improving? Are you able to trade a method profitably on consistent basis, and then move on to live if you can trade for a whole year? I am here to share with the group and practice this method together, not trying to prove I am a great trader with LIVE money. I would want people to practise this for a year before going live. I am just sharing some knowledge and if people want to follow it that is great, if not that is also great. Showing Live account results does not change the way I would trade this method.

maybe a setup on GBPUSD late on tonight.

at bottom of daily channel.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
No...It is not what I meant...I put my trade into myfxbook for analysis only. NOT SHOW OFF...'cause weekly I review my trades, which pair I do well, why? if not why? Track time I enter the time, like Us open, london open, or tokyo open...to see what is the successful rate. It really helps me so far. As you can see in the January, I didn't do so well...I review them and correct the mistake....I think it is ONLY way to improve it. Just my opinions...Good luck on Trading!!!!

--- 帖子 #493 ---
on the H4 chart, draw your trendlines and note how you have a downtrend chanel? The price is now brushing up against the upper boundary of this downchanen at aroud 1.3600 ??? I believe this is a good opportunity to go in short and ride it down to the other end of the channel. Or at least to 1.34 if this channel resistance holds.

--- 帖子 #494 ---

Thanks for that alert. Have been lurking around here for some time.I find your system and analysis good and simple. Although i primarily trade another system, rode her down for +60 on a reduced lot. Good work. Keep it up.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
hi all,currently in a short trade...maybe reverse @ channel=high? or from 3700 till 3600 (to 4h tl and 61.8 fib)

EU 1H chart. I took bounce off broken trendline. Was good for +50 at best.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Good one Survivor. This is a US holiday and it is slow trading day. But good on you for seeing this one .. Congrats on the 50 pips .. awesome job

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Just for sake of correctness, i didn't capture entire move. I got out at +30. I got jittery on 15M PA and as you said NY was closed so i thought it was better to take quick profit instead of looking for a home run. Thanks. I am loving your system.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Pureprice i must say i am loving BORC and we must pursue it more intensely. Here was today's killer trade. EU 4H BORC. Could have fine tuned with 15M to catch precise low. Minimum 100 Pips even to late joiners.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I agree . but I have been too busy with work and will concentrate on end of day setups (so basically Daily charts, maybe If I am lucky I get to check out 4H). Will post those around 5-6 pm daily. I did not post yesterday cause it was a US holiday. Looks like eurchf daily LONG triggered today

--- 帖子 #504 ---
here is the chart setup for a long

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Watch price closely here as gbpusd is at bottom of uptrend chanel .. good oortunity to go long if this channel holds. You may wish to go down to H1 timeframe to fine tune your entry here. Remeber we need a nice a bulish formation followed up PA to confirm entry long

this one is approaching the bottom of a daily channel and may bounce as it touches the bottom boundary of the channel ... kep this one on your radar screen.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
price is at a resistane level, however it also is at botom of uptrend line. We need to close below this line (see chart), and have bearish formation, folowed by confirming PA to go short

--- 帖子 #511 ---
If we get a daily close below the channel followed by PA, we might see this pair tank down.

I have been reading this forum over the last week and compliment you on putting forward some good and well explained posts. They have helped me.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Thank you for your sharing. I have been following and learning. Please keep up your good work. Chris

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I am sure this is one of nice no nonsene systems. Charts you post are great. I dont trade all the currencies you post. But i have been using the system for some time now intraday with good sucess. There maybe many reasons we dont see many posts here. Maybe because not enough posts so few followers. Or maybe the system is too simple? I think people find fancy charts with funny indicators more challenging which is true. Indicators indeed make trading very challenging. Anyway here are trades that i took with BORC. See how effective it is. I would love to keep this thread active so that people may benefit from your insight.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I have been reading for last month all this posts, and it really help me to understand more about price action on intraday basis. Keep it up your good work. I didn´t post any images because I exceded my Kbytes for posting anything on the forum. Can someone please explain me what I can do to resolve this problem?? Thanks And keep on your good work

@kkk555, Good call on GBPCHF, I am in 1.50487.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
i think if someone can attach and explain the trendmeleaveme gold version, it would help more traders to participate in this thread since, we can make the trendline analysis and let the EA take care of the trendline Bounce trade. I believe the TMLM gold version has BuyLimit and selllimit that would work for the Bounce off the the trendline system idea. Also finding setups on H1 and below would increase the activity in this thread. Good job on the pdf, explanation and posting the results. Your setting the standard =)

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Thank you for your suggestion , would you be so kind as to post the EA here?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
come cross this tread, great one. i like naked method. this is the exact same system i am using everyday.it is shame it is quiet now. do you still use this system? can you post ?pureprice

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I would post more setups if anyone is interested, but it appears that no one was really following, so i stopped assuming the method was well digested by everyoen and no one needed any more explanation

--- 帖子 #529 ---
pls post more charts and setups with explanation

very good ea for limit orders http://blog.tipster.ca/p/links-to-code-mql-afl.html regards

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hello Pure Price Are you using this strategy on live account? I`m interest in this strategy because I don`t like the indicators, now i try on demo this kind of strategy, on higher TF 4H and Daily. Regards Danutz

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Thanks for posting those charts. Seems like you are geting the idea.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
This is a great EA for placing orders based on lines. Thanks for posting it ...

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Today is a not agood day for trading NY as it is a bank holiday in the USA. However, i maybe back tomorrow with some charts

--- 帖子 #537 ---
No problem It will be very good to show us some examples how do you place limit orders diagonaly or horizontaly with sl and pt based on BORC or other patterns. regards

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I think this is a great and timeless charting method which proves itself in all markets and timeframes - it is nice to have it 'formalized' or have attention brought to it via this thread, so thank you PurePrice for starting it. I would be interested in you or the readers/subscribers of this thread posting setups as they occur - I will try to do the same. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Here is an example (though many hours late): EURUSD yesterday and today on the M5 in which three BORC trades came to pass over about 12 hours. It would be interesting to automate this, but geometry and trendlines are very difficult to code reliably.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Thanks Will. Glad to have you on board please feel free to post chart setups. I have been extremely busy with my fulltime job as a result i do not get much time to get online and post setups, unfortunately.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
here is a setup on usdchf a few hours ago .. the arrow is where you would setup a limit sell after a "false" breakout

--- 帖子 #542 ---
similar setup on EU naturally opposite to usdchf above

--- 帖子 #543 ---
here is another one from GU h1

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Thanks - I am the same way, very busy at work 9-6 EST. I will try to post setups as I see them and I hope it encourages others to do the same as I think this can be a core trading system when combined with confluence of major S/R/Trendlines on H4/Daily/Weekly charts.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
there are a couple of setups here where the arrows are both long trades

--- 帖子 #546 ---
yeah, work gets in the way of trading

--- 帖子 #547 ---
here is one setup on usdjpy (I never trade this pair as it is sooo slooooooow)

--- 帖子 #548 ---
pity that you no longer have time for you to contribute your examples .. I read the entire thread, and certainly I have found valuable information thanks to thy post. but sometimes you would be able to add here a series of graphs with some valid input to the rest of us what they study. would it be? mentor Good luck.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Now that I look at it I thought it might go down after reflection from the TL and would puncture the slide.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
I just like to say that I like your thread and ideas, it's allmost exactly as I trade with a few exeptions, PA is my base system and I use it as fondation for any ideas. if I could vouch for you I would, keep it up

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I am glad you like it. Hopefully you are making good pips trading in a similar way.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I will be attempting to post more charts as the week unfolds. Keep an eye on this thread for upcoming setups

--- 帖子 #553 ---
AudUsd is now rejected at support level and may rally up for a few pips. However, if (that is a big if) this support is broken with a false break to the downside, we may see a BORC setup in a few hours.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
here is a possible GU setup on H4. May bounce off the trendline and go back up, if it ever gets down to the blue rectangle area

--- 帖子 #555 ---
here is one that may materialize soon on usdchf h1 at the 0.9000 psychological area .. watch this one closely

--- 帖子 #556 ---
that was awesome move to downward... I earned some money I want to learn from you.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
what U say? is ist posible?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Thanks for posting the chart setup Brontoo. Yeah, that is a possible BORC long setup around 1.0750. The price went up to 10785 and got rejected down. We "might" see a bounce off 10750 area to the long side again and TP would be around 10795 just before the round number at 10800

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I am glad someone made money I was hoping for a bigger move though, but it only went down around 20 or so pips. I am still hoping that it would tank down to previous swing low around 0.8940 area or so.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I also expect more movement, and I had two positions. The first was about 15 pips, and the second was more distant ... It ended BE +2 I am glad.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Now when I look at the chart I see yet another possible entry

--- 帖子 #562 ---
That is certainly another trendline line to watch for in AU, if the first area fails this second area may hold for a long position. However our first area around 10750 seems to be holding for now (price went up to 10767 for the time being)

--- 帖子 #563 ---
USDJPY has an interesting level coming up thaty may be worth watching. Check out the area between 79.80-80.00 for a long entry

--- 帖子 #564 ---
This one looks like it already bounced about 30 pips just above the 80.00 figure at 80.02

--- 帖子 #565 ---
this was very good situation... only a look back example....

--- 帖子 #566 ---
hi Brontoo i like price actions but your analysis is very good are you always on this thread

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Follow this chart for possible entry.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
That is a good possibility Brontoo, I don't follow Gold myself, so this is great that you are charting it using BORC

--- 帖子 #569 ---
today is the most interesting enter setup from all the majors pairs.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Brontoo do you only trade gold cus your set up were good

--- 帖子 #571 ---
I traded primarily majors. occasionally gold, when I see a good pattern ..

--- 帖子 #572 ---
So, we have had some chart setup in the past couple of days. It would be helpful to see what happened to those setups . I'll do that in a minute ...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
The entry was around 15840 ... This one went down to about 15800 nad then bounced backup to 15900 for +60 pips.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
This one was a dead cat bounce right around the 0.9000 figure. It went down about 15-20 pips then kind of went up a bit, then tanked down again to around 0.8945 as that was the almost the target we talked about 8940 area. so this one was about +50 pips

--- 帖子 #575 ---
This one also went down to about 10740 then bounced right up as expected to around 1.0785 area (which was previous swing high) ... this would be about +35 pips from our suppose entry around 1.0750

--- 帖子 #576 ---
This one happened in Tokyo session where the price got very close to the 80.00 figure (actually it got down to 80.015 on my platform), then quickly shot up to around 80.77 area for around +75 pips.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
here is one from today frankfort/london session .... did anyone catch this one, cuz i certainly did not??

--- 帖子 #578 ---
it was very fast. only one bar... and in this time I'm still sleep.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
It is now the end of NY session and am just finishing off my work here, and was looking to see if there is any setups that we need to be aware of. Unfortunately, i don't see any obvious setups on my charts (looking at H1 only). If anyone else sees good setups, please post them here for all of us to see, and your effort will be very much appreciated by all I am sure.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
AS I do not follow Gold, was there actually a trade there Brontoo? Did you take it ? What was the outcome?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Yes that was very fast and I was asleep too ... it seems like i am always sleeping

--- 帖子 #582 ---
i have seen all your possibility entry setup, and I thought about entry.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I also... especially in morning

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I am in NY time zone so I miss alot of good setups during frankfort and london sessions while I am sleeping. Looks like you are doing well trading this week brontoo

--- 帖子 #585 ---
and I am in EU time zone... I can trade frankfurt, london, and NY exchnge.... of course when awake. U need living in EU.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Yes. This week is one of the better ones. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I wish i was living in EU to trade these sessions, but that is why I need you guys to help out by tradng those setups for me

--- 帖子 #588 ---
if I know then help you.... you also helping me to. .. excuse my bad english..

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Here is something that just developed that might turn into a good BORC setup. Consider going long around 1.5900 after the figure was broken to the upside, and may now retrace back to test the figure before bouncing back up. Let's see where this one goes. Here is the chart for reference

--- 帖子 #590 ---
these two pairs behave very similar usually... here is what I am seeing

--- 帖子 #591 ---
small bounce..going up!

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I just to want to say that I am using similar technique with good results on my demo account. Great thread!

--- 帖子 #594 ---
hi guys i think eurjpy maybe going up soon can we look @ it together

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I also want post posible entry setup at USDCHF.... watch carefully.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Good work for PurePrice and the rest of you guys. Count me in!

--- 帖子 #597 ---
GBPUSD was also interesting..... I was away...pity

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi, just picked up on this thread and like what I see!! Would this trade not have been stopped out though?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Depends where you place your SL and TP. This one went up about 50 pips before dropping, and it only dropped about 30 pips below entry before it bounced up again. So again, it all depends how you managed your trade, it may or may not have been stopped out.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Thanks Davit. PLease post your setups whenever you can so we can see how you trade also.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
chart are crazzzzy.....

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Evidently it depends on where you put your SL, but I thought your own entry method would have got you in at the break of the pin-bar, with SL below the pin-bar. And price went up 30 pips from the break of pin-bar, before dropping 30 pips below it (50 pips from the entry price). Have I got this right as far as your own personal method of entry, SL placement etc?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
That is because Fed's Bernanke is speaking ... I usually stay on the sidelines when someone is speaking, as the markets react in an unpredictable fashion, and u normally get whipped if you are in the market at that point in time.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Well, if u want to get the best entry price, you would just place a limit buy or sell order and get filled right at the area of the bounce, and have SL of about 50 pips in place. IF you wish to wait for confirmation and candle closure, then you will certainly have a wider SL because you have to account for the candle size, in this case the pinbar formation.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Bernanke really shake with cards.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Now I look no this chart.... If candle close above the horizontal at 1.5900 line is posible move to upward.. and bounce from the trend line. then make valid BORC entry, with target on the support line... if close below the horizontal line, is posible downward move...

--- 帖子 #607 ---
that is an excellent example there Brontoo ... did u take this trade ??

--- 帖子 #608 ---
is a good example, but I will not trade it ... because missing atractivity... for me. and did U trade it?

--- 帖子 #609 ---
looks like our NZDUSD chart worked out perfectly in Tokyo session. The other charts took way too long and we were up against Bernanke testimony before those chart setup mateialized. I normally would not enter any trades around big news events such as speeches. As it stands now however, looks like GU is actually bounced against the 15900 figure at 15903 or so that we outlined last night, so that setup is in play currently, as Brontoo just mentioned also a couple of postings ago.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Look like very nice respect support and resistance levels today. and also nice bonce UP no the blue line.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I see a few possible BORC setups 1- GBPUSD long entry around 1.5900 as is the case currently 2- CADUSD short entry around 0.9900 as currently is th3 case as this pair is already starting to retreat down form 0.9908 3-USDCHF now that it finally has broken the 0.9000 figure to the upside, I expect that number to become support now and if the pair retraces and resest, the zone around 0.9000-0.9010 "should" hold as support and we may want to go long around this zone 4-NZDUSD has brokn down the rising channel and is now moving slowly upward. If this pair retraces all the way back to the lower boundar of the channel or where the price broke down outta the rising channel it may give us a short opportunity there

--- 帖子 #612 ---
That is a good one too, i didnto see that one but thanks for pointing that out brontoo. As you can see, these setups are everywhere you just gotta train your eyes to see them

--- 帖子 #613 ---
USDCAD is very nice setup... thanks... I am short entry0.9886 sl 0.9910 tp 0.9850 ... thank you for you analysis... nice work.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
This pair demands a big spread normally and it makes huge moves usually so I dont usually look at it often, but if u have the guts to trade it, you may wish to look for a long entry around the 1.2825-12850 zone if it retraces that far down

I just linked to FF Trade Explorer and I have no idea if I did correctly or not ... it just showed up on top on of this thread and I assume it is working although there is a warning msg there Anyway, the idea is that I will be trying to track trade setups on this thread starting March 1st and see how these trades do by end of each month. This is DEMO account and as such i would likely be doing about 5% per trade SL to start and move the SL as the trade develops.

Thank you for sharing this. Sometimes, it is really good to sit back and reflect on the simplicity at times.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
You are most welcome Jason. Hope you find some useful information and good trade setups on this thread that may help with your trading. You are correct though, sometimes simple is good and sometimes it is good to reflect on simple things.

@PurePrice: I guess this is why u shorted the nzd/usd right? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I hope yes.. lol The trade looks good though. I am thinking for TP somewhere at 0.8340

--- 帖子 #620 ---
There is also rounded number 0.8400.... Is ist double point of interest... trend line and psych.. line :-)

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Oh yeah never noticed that, thanks Ill start trading this method live soon, so expect lots of setups from me. Its actually really close to my previous one, but i havent had time for trading the past several months...

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Yes and yes. NzdUSd is at the trendline, and round number at the same time The other trades i was just screwing around to see what this trade explorer is all about. I will also take some resistance/support line trades everynow and then, like the GBPJPY trade i have open now that GJ was at previous resistance level and was showing signs of retreat. Don't ask me about the AU trades

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Good to hear rait. I would like to see as many setups as possible. Welcome aboard

--- 帖子 #624 ---
1- GU went up nicely after hitting 1.5900 just as expected to almost the previous swing high around 15975. 2- Same for USDCAD, it went down nicely after hitting 0.9900 to previous swing low around 0.9850. 3- USDCHF never materialized and didnot go down far enough to trigger trade. 4- NZDUSD is now currently open short entry at 0.8399... will update this as the trade closes eithe in profit or loss. currently is a few pips in profit.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I've made all my trades public now. You should be able to see my open trades, my pending trades, profit targets and stop loss levels if you wish to follow my thinking and that way I don't need to post all the setups ahead of time. I will still post some charts every now and then if i think it is worth commenting about or if there is something really intersting about the setup. Otherwise, my pending orders should really give away the setup and what i am thinking about much like you guys figured out eh nzdusd short trade

--- 帖子 #626 ---
looks it great.. I wonder what it is.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
morning brontoo any pair in watchlist

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Guys correct me if im wrong, but these are about to be good if go further enough and bounce back at the line right? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The nzd/usd trade is going good for now... still waiting for tp @ .8340

--- 帖子 #629 ---
TP hit @ 0.8340 And also i believe we should watch this channel that formed in the eu/usd too Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Yes. If there bounce on the line, it is possible BORC entry.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
I use smth like that for medium-term trading

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Congrats on NZDUSD .. patience paid off for you around +60 pips And many thanks for contributing those chart setups. Keep them coming.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hey brontoo, did u trade this one? How did it go?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Good looking charts, Will keep an eye on them but given it is Friday I think I am done trading for the week. Thanks for posting

--- 帖子 #635 ---
That is nice to know, welcome to this thread.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
no. I waited to be bounced from support after cross the trend line... I just tradet NZDUSD.... with problems.. In first trade, I don´t believed him... look on my trade list...

Hi, sounds interesting but for some reason I can't save it to MT4?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Hi... I have been look at your chart and compare to my chart... and I see diferent thinks....I edit your chart... but today ist Friday.... hands off Can you see it anywhere ... but it depends on how much you want to TP. satisfactory unless the 10-30 pips. it is a good chance of winning. you can also winning more. depends only on right entry setup... and of course real tp level. because waiting on no real TP level will kill him, and you will end with loss..

--- 帖子 #640 ---
what do you need save?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I want highlight this chart. is no need comment be careful.. no dogma..

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Am not saying anyone should trade it, what am saying is it what watching together to see if any opportunity next week Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I see some more setups developing, but it is friday night and i think it is too late for trading. You guys have a great weekend and expect from me to test this concept the whole next week on most of the majors.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I am not wisdom but this opportunity is possible. We can wait what say pureprice... But I think, wait to breakout the line, and then we will see.....

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Of course have a nice weekend guys. Next week we will continue.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Dear Pure Price, or shall i address you as PP (for short). Thank you for opening this thread, My style of trading is very similar but i do combine the 1-2-3 setup or as some say A-B-C setup along with fibs and a couple of MA's. MA is used exclusively for support and resistance but your pivot indicator is just as good. Here i am attaching a chart of GBP/jpy. Let me know what you think.. Last week we saw a good down move on this pair but it gained almost all of it back by the end of the week. This puts the new weekly perspective to a bullish mode but on the hourly time frame, i find it bearish until 128.62 which is 161.8 of the hourly retracement, so either there should be a gap until 128.62-70 or it might go down to that level on monday and then start it's bullish rally. Here is a chart. Do tell me your thoughts on this. I enjoy constructive criticism, so please don't hesitate to tell me if i am totally wrong :-)

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Getting ready for the next week. I have all the charts set up and i am thinking about setting up one demo account and linking it to the trade explorer so i can track my results. As i said ill try to watch and post signals on all the major usd pairs (only those, i have really bad experience with any other crosses, especially GBP/JPY - i blowed one of my older accounds with it ) so please PurePrice, brontoo and the others watch and judge them @stringfx i find your charts a bit confusing with all those indicators and stuff. remember it is an indicator free method?

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I find the charts a bit too busy and hard to read. I am not a beliver in fib levels and as such can't really comment on those. I am trying to keep the charts as clean as possible and only look for obvious support/resistance levels. But good luck with your trading and you should trade the way yu feel is most appropriate for your and your personality.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I am short USDCHF on a daily entry. This is not a BORC trade but more of an S/R trade where the price is touching the falling trendline and I am hoping that the price will get rejected here at the line and fall a few pips (preferably a couple hundred pips ). Here is the chart and I believe someone else posted it earlier, but here iit is again, just in case u missed it before.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
here is a pair I never trade, but if you trade this pair and familiar with its personality you may want to consider going Long on this one, if this daily candle closes as a bullish engulfing. Note that my platform daily candle starts at 00 EST, and your platform maybe different.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
pretty much exactly the same as USDCHF above ... If you are gonna trade those, only one or the other as you are basically doubling your exposure. However, if u wish to trade both, trade only 1/2 your normal lot size on each so that you are risking the same amount as if you were trading only one of those pairs, as if one trade fails, it is very very likely the second one will fail exactly the same way.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
pureprice the usdchf on 4 hours look like uptrend let look @ this together Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Good morning... i see so many setups so far. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Long -GBP/USD - two lines coincidence... this is a borc setup i believe. Attached Image (click to enlarge) - not a BORC setup, but really strong trend line - long AUD/USD (and possible botc setup later) Attached Image (click to enlarge) - Long USD/JPY - BORC setup Watch the NZD/USD... it is about to tuch really stron support line... omg im hungry i need a breakfast Ill post SL and TPs later. So glad i am not trading this live, i guess when i start ill have to wake up way early...

--- 帖子 #654 ---
As i said, NZD/USD is about to tuch strong support line. I just nothiced the same thing for the EU/USD. Watch closely. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Guys i am waiting for your opinion about those setups.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Okay: GBP/USD - Long @1.5819, SL : 1.5801. TP: 1.5848 (small trade but theres another resistance line closely) AUD/USD - Long @ 1.0716, SL:1.0693, TP: 1.0750.. for now... but since this is a major support line i believe we can hunt more USd/JPY - Long @ 81.25, SL: 81.07, TP:81.50... probably will move SL to BE as soon as possible because i just dont have good feeling about this trade.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
SL: GBP/USD - got hit....

--- 帖子 #657 ---
AUD/USD - too... oh well i guess not a good start of the week

--- 帖子 #658 ---
hi guys another setup i think would be good this week and let us look @ it EURUSD look more down side Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #659 ---
in this thread i think we all looking for ways to maximised our profit so we need to discus whatever anyone posted may be we can get something out of it example i posted some setup last friday is one in short on AUDUSD

--- 帖子 #660 ---
here is the move on the audusd i posted on friday see page 43 am looking for around 100 pips hopefully Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Re-entry GBP/USD Long @ 1.5804, SL: 1.5780, TP: 1.5840 Attached Image (click to enlarge) And another possible BORC set-up if hits 1.5840 and starts moving down...

--- 帖子 #662 ---
guys this set-up on eurjpy could be a potential trade if bounce upon touching the level with arrow Attached Image (click to enlarge) . i love it if you guys contribute i mean we look at it togeher that is going to help us all

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Just hit the TP. Now waiting for a short setup....

--- 帖子 #664 ---
USD/JPY - TP order filled

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I believe this is a BORC short setup, but since that major support line mentioned this morning(red line) is close, and also we are jiggling around that support line (yellow line) i will pass that trade...

--- 帖子 #666 ---
@ Raitchev, I think you are drawing the lines correctly and picking good entry points for TL and Borc setups. However, I think the reason why you are getting stopped out is that your SL placement is too close to the price that you are getting stopped out. When trading the hourly or higher timeframes your SL needs to be wider than 25 pips (as it seems you have been doing). 25 pips may work on 15m or 5m timeframe but I really believe that you will get taken out many time un-ncessarily in H1 TF, if you use this tight SL. You should consider about 50+ pips SL for H1, and you will need to adjust your lot size accordingly to control you risk. Just a suggestion that may help with your trades not being stopped out too early.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I've been thinking about that PP... my major concern is, though, that my R:R will not be good if i put bigger SL. I think i prefer to do a reentry (as it happend today), rather to make more room for the trade, but to risk more than the possible reward. I could aim at the same TP as the first trade, but open the position at better quote, which basically will make up for the first stop hit. As it happened today: I first opened long g/u @ 1.5819 and my, SL got hit. Later i opened another long but @ 1.5804, which gave me 15 more pips, with pretty much the same TP. Actually i have no idea why i didint put exactly the same TP, but u get the idea. However, thats definately a thing that i should consider improving someway. Anyways, i dont see anymore setups for today, so lets sum up: -18 -23 +36 +25 --- Monday total: +20 pips... Considering that AUD/USD wasnt exactly a BORC setup, i think it is okay... better than nothing. All BORC setups would produce total of +43 pips for the day. And this is only usd majors... And this is my money management... i guess some people could made much more . As shown by Tiwa there were some more setups in the crosses also. Do you guys think that i am posting too many charts and kinda flood the thread? Because it seemed that i was almost the only one who posted charts today it felt kinda weird.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
I am today on the charts did not see anything interesting, and I also traded .... in no way ...

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Trade what you see... u didint see anything... u didnt trade - good choice. Good luck tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Again, trade what you are comfortable with. As for posting charts, you cna never post too many charts .. so it is perfectly ok to post the setups as you see them that is how we will all learn and maybe someone else will see a setups we dont see

hi guys this set-up is on EURUSD 4h this could be a promising trade if break out of the channel but need to to wait for pull back. Let us all look at it Attached Image (click to enlarge) patient - greedy = success

--- 帖子 #673 ---
it will be apriciate if we all intaract when any set-up show up this will help us patient-greedy=succuess

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Cant see any setups so far... the E/U channel got broken though, so i guess if we see pullback from the support line we can look for a short position. Patience - Greed = Success i like that

--- 帖子 #675 ---
nice work on the AU breakout to the downside there tiwa. I am long now AU at the 10600 figure. Thought this maybe a good support area for AU looking back where it was supported before. Lets see if she holds

--- 帖子 #676 ---
The rising channel got broken to the downside decisively, and we now wait for it to pullback up to the channel and may get BORC setup short. I, however tried to buy the support line overnight an I got my ass kicked for -50 pips as the support line on the channel was nicely broken. oh well, losing is part of this business and there wil be losers along the way, especially if you dont wait for candle formation, which i nowadays don't because I am either sleepign or at work and can't always watch what happens around the zone of interest. I therefore place pending orders at what I think would be the best entry price and place 50 pips SL in case I am wrong, just like the case wa in EU long I took at 13200. We'll get 'em next time

--- 帖子 #677 ---
PP can you please share with us your thoughts about the AU? Because what I see is this, and i dont see any reason for long positions atleast until we hit that support line... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #678 ---
I see your point. However, I usually like to get in at round numbers as they present psychological barriers and price tends to reverse at those numbes. In the case of AU, I thought it was close enough to the round number and I didnot want to miss the entry, so I decided to place pending order at 10600 so that I can get filled. I could have waited another 30 pips maybe, but then when i am sleeping and have no idea where the price will go down to, i place an order where i think it is likely to get filled and reverse. I thought 10600 and the additionally support lines should be good confluence to enter inthat zone. Again we are looking for an entry zone, not an exact number, unless you are watching the charts all the time, and you can fine tune your entry, which is the better way to enter if you have the luxury of screen time.

ok guys i wiil advice not to look long exepct on (stiill judge for yourself pls) on usdchf 4 hour the rest look for short. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Remember patient-greed=success

Am on let us discuss them

--- 帖子 #681 ---
all those are nice setups, however we need them to break out first, as those may still be fake breakouts since we do not have a few candles away from those levels yet. Unless you go to a shorter time frame of course. We need to watch those charts as they are starting to breakout now, we may yet need a couple more candles in the direction of the breakout, then a pullback back to the levels, then we trade.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Hi all... today was very nice situation on GBPJPY... look on chart... my brooker give me a big spread.. about 6 pip... I am this trade only on my demo. And on my live account i am trade GBPUSD.. because have a smeller spread.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Still not a valid BORC signal (for me), but i believe soon there will be a reason to short the G/U

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Short GBP/USD @ 1.5732, SL: 1.5765. TP: 1.5667 I dont need to post a graph just look at the one above. I was just waiting for one bearish bar, maybe i entered a bit early, but considering the R:R it looks good for me.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
I am with you. Shorted GU at 1.5731 it went down as low as 1.5698 but went back up. Now profit +10. Will hold on to it.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Patience

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Although the price went up, the price action still respects that trendline so i still have faith in that trade

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hm interesting situation here at USD/JPY 1. White trend line got broken. 2. Yellow trend line got broken again. 3. Red support line crosses in pretty much the same spot. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
We are setup for a short BORC on EU .. We already have a pinbar formed right at the BORC zone around 13280-13300 on H1 charts, but it so late in the day now to trade... here is the chart you may want to keep in mind for the next few hours

--- 帖子 #690 ---
its the first time i noticed this thread...you and i have similar perspectives about trading ...but i really have lots of things to learn from u...thanks for sharing ur screenshots here..

--- 帖子 #691 ---
I waited several hours for this pullback and entry on usdcad. Worked out nicely.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
This one worked out very nicely to the tune of about 150+ pips

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Welcome selym. I visited your thread and yes, we trade a similar style it seems like Feel free to post your setups here

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I was trading a demo account on fxpro for this strategy, but that interfered with my live account, and I decided to delete the demo account altogether so that does not happen again.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Can you please send us the details of the chart. I am away from my computer. I am wondering what is happening.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Well, the EU had broken down below uptrend line and then went up to the breakpoint of the line and BROC'd there bouncing down and went down again to the minor support at 13100. Now it is sitting right at that level with a nice bearish englufing daily candle closed. If you zoom out a bit you will also observe that the EU is actually in a downtrend channel where the price was rejected at the top of that falling channel around 13480 a few days ago. If this channel holds, and we continue the downtrend, we may have a nice entry SHORT on the break of 13100 now that we already had the BORC confirming that the downtrend is in play.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
The chart setup detail was posted in post #689.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Thank you. It was very nice work. I am glad you.
