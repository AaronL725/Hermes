Surelly it's interesting. Where is the indicator?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Dear Shahrooz67 (the best year):-) It would be good to desctibe the teory, but also entery and exit criteria. If you use indicator, it would be good to post it here so we can chack the logic and try to backtest as well as to understand what your aproach is. BR Thanks for posting. sasa

--- 帖子 #4 ---
First of all, Shahrooz, Thank you for your fx knowledge sharing gesture! I am interested in following your trades and charts. I prefer daily chart trading , not 1 or 5 minutes trading. Will I be able to achieve success with your indi? Can we have indi. please? Behman.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Interesting....Waiting for more details. Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you for sharingyour metod Shah. I would love to hear about the theory behind the indicator and system. Please do share. Thank you! SirWolf

--- 帖子 #7 ---
shahrooz67, I don't want to rain on your parade so to speak, BUT you use the MTF indicator, and that means: since we use M1, the color of the M5-MTF can repaint itself for the last 4-5 bars, and the color of the M15-MTF can repaint itself for the last 14-15 bars? Am I right? (The same would happen with any other combination of the timeframes, but I'm interested im M1) If I'm wrong - please explain. If I'm right - how can you take a signal if you're not sure - maybe the next minute the M15 or the M5 color could change?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
dear my friends ! the indic use the current time frame datas and compare it with the last detalis of selected time frame so that won't repaint ! consider the price which on M15 has closed as A we are trading on m5 so it uses the price of current candle assume B with A and backs the results ! as B and A never change, the indic never repaint !

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Seems you are trying to sell something here on FF? so much speak just t tell - Hey Guys I'm cool yeb, but i'lll never give it to you

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Yeah i am going to post very thing in next days but i should get sure that there are more interests for the ravie ! i have sent examples in any time frames to show the capabilities of the method ! as i said before there is still works to do , my goal to share the method is surely to benefit all ! because there are still wroks to do which team works can make it lots better. the most principle work is to code the touch points better.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
consider as no offense please ! here is every thing for free , no charge ! i do share the method because first i need some one professional to code the indic better ! i will share the idics and templates surely and i will post every thing till next days ! every thing is fur all and benefits get to all( if there is any interest)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
As the posts posted by others passing 15 , i will print the section two which is more about the theories and ideas of fractals which lead to touch points . now i am working on the text of the post and stoped trading now for couple of hours .

--- 帖子 #13 ---
So we have to wait until the M-15 candle closes? Let's say right now is 3:01 PM and we see that M-1, M-5 and M-15 are the same color. Do we have to wait until 3:15? P.S. No offence, but all MTF-indicators work the same way and all of them repaint - it is just the nature of the beast.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
When it is 3:01 PM , it used the results of till 3:00 pm for m15 then compare the results of M1 with that candle ! if it is 3:06 it uses 6th candle of m1 in 3:00 and feed the results to the M15 (i meant till 3:00 candle) then use some math and then back the results ! as u can see it use just passed and sured closed price

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I see. Now I got it! If you work at 3:01 with the M15 candle that's closed at 3:00 - then the indicator wouldn't repaint. Yes, it is a very interesting idea! P.S. I ask questions not because I want to be annoying , but because I want to understand all the details.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
It is OK with me because questions help me to review my knowledge and challange me if i do not know the answer ! there is an iranian proverb which says ! asking question is not a shame but if you do not know the answer it is a shame !

--- 帖子 #17 ---
That's a good one! shahrooz67, take your time, post the theory and the indicator not when somebody demands but when YOU are good and ready!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
What are fractals?! In Wikipedia: A fractal has been defined as "a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole, a property called self-similarity . May be you have heard of Jackson Pollock the great painter with real strange arts! When you look at his works you can see nothing expect combination of accidentally spattered paints on a canvas. There were lots of critics on him and most of his Contemporary artists have known him as strange rubbish painter with mad drawings! But he resisted the critics and said it is not accidental and a can take controls of the paints! Years later, at the end of 1990, Richard Taylor the Physicist of university of Oregon studied a collection of Pollock’s works has came to this conclusion which these painting are followed by a defined Fractal template years before the innovation of these templates. According to two reasons he was correct on his studies! First, Jack let his canvas on the ground and he spattered then the paints on it, moving around the canvas in strange and accurate angles! and before this, men has reached to this results that when someone is in an unbalanced state his body shows a define fractal movements of itself and the films which were shoot of Jack Pollock when painting approved this. And the second reason is, these kinds of spattering the paints on the canvas could be a part of theory of chaos. What?!?!?! Where is the similarity between these rubbish and FX?!?!?!? Be patient please! Years later Fractals were used much more in image processing and broadcasting technologies! Monitoring, imaging etc! To reduce the size and bits of images there are many technologies which uses fractals but how?! They use a low size shape which is form of a complete image and then expand the first model by thousands times to reach to original shapes! AHA, we are getting closer as u can guess now! Our charts repeat themselves in locations and models! To say better everything in nature and everything related to human beings tend to use template or model! Like our lovely charts pattern! By defining these models we can assume that our charts use the models too! There are complex math doings behind the theories that we can pass them because they have past their exams before! The factors which are important in calculating the fractals are just three ones! Number of repeating! Size of breaking into smaller or bigger pieces and the most important one defining the edge or specific detail which is our origin and our calculation should start from!!! Perhaps you have learned from the Basic Math about turning points! Yes they are here the most important price fields as I think!!!They are our factor three which cause that we can identify them and expect the market to use again their templates. But why these Points?! there are more than three reasons for this but to tell it easily 1-they are the best regions of the charts which can be modeled into shapes like ellipse and circles which we can calculate them easier 2- the derivative of these points defines divergences and third Trend lines pass through them ! (Have ever asked yourself why your eyes are gazed at top and bottom with the first glance of the charts?!) They have results with severe math formulas! Yes everything has math behind it I believe LOL Any Way touch points are calculated by these easy Turning points! At the end I emphasize on the there factors and the Origin factor! U can find them by naked eyes also easily! Attached I have marked the Origin points of some pics and charts. The points are between blue Rectangles and the modeled are with imprecise Ellipse . Looking at some examples of fractals and charts

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Very Interesting shah! I look forward to following your thread and learing more. Thanks again for sharing!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thx man, but seems no one cares in ideas here and all important are some indics which just the utility is important not the way it works(When u do not know how some thing works How do you expect it to function properly ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?) ! any way i will post $hah Oscilator hours later ! It is University time now ! See u around

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Great Job dear Shahrooz I am looking forward hear more about your amazing trading method specially about fractals that is one of my favorite subjects. keep the way Dude.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
First of all, Thanks for sharing your knoweledge and ideas. Nice to have a Persian guy here..... So ancient history and civilization come from your country.... Anyway, I don't fully agree with your last words..... Well, I think theory is important, but is not always necessary to have a deep theoretical knoweledge to do something in the good way..... E.g. is not necessary to know thermodinamic laws to drive a car...... Or know Binary math &amp; how semiconductors are mede of, to make a good use of a personal computer..... Moreover, there's an Italian proverb (Not so shure it's Italian...... ) wich says: If I read... I forget, If I see... I remember, If I do..... I LEARN So, it's not always our hurry to be spoonfed, knowing nothing about the basis of a system, but maybe we see something interesting in a new thread, and are anxious to learn more, and see how to use it..... As you certainly know, there are thousands of threads, here in FF. And, how much time wasted too, following threads that leads to nothing......

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Nice proverb Aztrader. I think I,ll remember that and use it in my next job interview.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
shahrooz67, I don't want to speak for others, but I am not just waiting for the indicator (as I said before, post it when you're good and ready, not when somebody demands), I am very interested in your ideas and want to hear more. For example, we have a very popular thread "The System II" http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=80290 As far as I understand, "The System II" is all about the touch points, but the topic starter works with the pure PA only, without any indicators/fractals etc. It is not that easy to filter out the bad entries using just pure PA. Your approach seems to be very interesting and unusual.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Come on, shahrooz67! Your new thread got 2,500 views in 23 hours! It's A LOT! People are interested, most of them just don't speak out. People are different, you know... If I don't understand something, I keep asking until I got it, but a lot of people hate showing that they don't understand something. Guys, I suggest: in order to show the topic starter our interest - please rate the thread!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
@Favorite just calm down a bit, I guess our buddy is at university at the moment...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yes, but he'll be back! He lives in Iran - different time zone. So I think we'd better post our questions and suggestions when it is convenient for us , and he'll answer when it is convenient for him.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I'am now back home ! workin on the post about Phisical theories to put it simple and brief , i will post surely the post and indicator in which we can enter the trades ! it is 17:33 now and my favorite soccer team has a game on 6:00 so i'am back on 8:00 pm . thank you too all for sharing their ideas which can benefit all of us ! see you soon

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Excellent Proverb man, but there is quotes on it! You have also good knowledge on history, Our Great Ancient Rivals Rome the great! Unfortunately we slept in that Pride period and we are far far away of that culture! By the way I love it man TOTTI! The great team with Capello, Batistuta Nakata Totti WOW a good one! Anyway, when you want to use a car or computer you are totally right man, because you want just use it as a device! That is not the way you want to make a business with! Let me say it this how! Consider you are Truck driver you need the car for the market the business the work! So you do should have some basic knowledge about it! Let me repeat myself this is a way based on your looking at the chart with help!! The more you see the correct the more successful you are and even you can modify your trader assistant (I mean Touch point Indic) to help you better! For watching correctly and helping to improve the method (As I said hundreds times) you should know the principles! You cannot name, at least this ravie, as a money printing machine without anything about the manuals! Guys this needs Improvement! And Upgrading and Tuning needs info! This is teamwork Thread that needs experienced Traders or even brainstorming heads to benefit all.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
There is 8.5 hrs difference with the EST, that's what I thought. That's cool!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
shahrooz67, count me in! I'm not a programmer, so I can't help you to improve the indicator's code, but I'm willing to participate in testing, tuning, brainstorming and any teamwork.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hope ESTEGHLAL win The Game dear Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Shan, I do believe that there are otheers like me who have the need to know how things work. I can't use an indicator unless I know how it works. Otherwise I am essentially trading blindly. So, please do educate us - then share the indicator after we understand it. Thanks! SirWolf

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hoooooora ! Thx man ! we won the game and returned to the rank 1! I am now completly energized to continue

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Beeradar, Cut the Crap and show us your indi , so we all can make some $$$?? What say you??

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Ok As I think if you have too much theory followed each other the main Course will be spoiled and the motivation goes dead! Before continuing the theories I’m going to do some chartings! Easy but helpful! I ‘am sure u have all always saw the turning points on the charts and low and highs Valley and tops etc But have you ever really focused on them?! Have you ever thought why the price wants to turn back at A but Not B does?! Simple answer! Because A has the potential to reject the price and form a good geometrical shape for us! I do not discuss about the fundamental, not discuss about technical nor sentimental! I have just focused the reasons which are can convince me! For me math and theories can do this! Ok enough of long speech! Just clean your charts of every thing! Then download the Zigzag and Zigzag pointer Indic attached here! Thx to anyone who has already coded them! Try to download enough data on your charts (As much as you wish) Then drop the Zigzag on your Chart and set these to this number (Please do the same there are reasons behind this numbers which I will explain about it later) ExtDepth=10; ExtDeviation=2; ExtBackstep=3; In the example I have randomly selected EURGBP M15! You can choose any you wish I start since 17 January 2012 (the more you get back the more accurate) Draw Horizontal lines on the ZIGZAG breaks like image Now what you see until last is lots of horizontal Lines! Don’t be afraid they are all valuable! They are your guidance! Now to back test what I said! Go to a specified date! Here 17 January, and assume that you don’t know the prices from 23 January on! Now jus draw horizontal lines on breaks just between 17 January and 23 Ok this time scroll charts forward from 23 January till now! What do you see?! OW the price tends to repeat! Ain’t they?!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yes this lines are helpful if you tade price action patterns and for st tp - i prefer to draw them manually from 4h time. But i take not the tops but pivot points

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Now you may say! Such a fool! I could have drawn these lines even by hearts! With closed eyes! I say yes you would! I said it is easy! You answer: too many lines which are valuable which are not I say all are valuable but by times! The time should arrive first then the zones will be touched! You say ok if I draw a line on sth like USDCHF monthly the tops never be touched! There are hundred pips away! But I say are you sure about the market?! Can you predict the market?! They will be touched again but time requires! In some charts there are no Footprints of the market and I can do nothing for it! I try to use another method for my positional regions! Then you ask again in some cased there are tens of closed lines together I answer yes all are valuable but there are priorities among them! Consider an army! From a soldier to a top ranked lieutenant! How they will be ranked?! I say by three factors! Describe later

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Surly they are tp sls! But let me tell you sth! Do you know the difference between these lines and pivots?! They can conclude pivots but they are not surely the pivots! try some googling and find how to calculate pivots you just use the TF and timing and pricing consideration So it will make you to commit fault. Pivots have much more freedom of this! You know why?! Because they are not forced to be disciplinary and in a Wave motion pattern

--- 帖子 #40 ---
When i'v said about pivots i've ment turning points - where price moved lot's time (but in the middle of this candles.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
So i'am happy you know the differences ! you sound smart man ! But turning point can monitor on any time frames ! you draw them on H4 because that suits your method of trading and method of selecting TF ! wish luck Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #42 ---
MTF correlated points. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #43 ---
AHA finally some one dared to test ! nice work

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Without any complex words! Because of the private messaging around the indic i decided to post it earlier than expected ! But Please use it right with Touch Points ! I have not mentioned my rules or anything else ! indic is added just to demonstrate what it can do ! you can now test it by your own rules ! Mine will be published in a few days I have just uploaded $hah Indic! Just remember using this without knowledge about Touch Points, is useless! If you want to use it at current time frame set Timeframe to zero M5=5 M15=15 M30=30 H1=60 H4=240 D1=1440 W1=10080 M1=43200 Green=Buy Red=Sell Black=Side when you want to use it on different time zone chart (if you are using for Ex on m15 and want it to have on m30 and h1) do not forget to switch the first time on m30 and h1 then again to m15! This is required to download all the correct data! Then switch back to m15 and right click on all three indics and just once left click ok! That’s all! For any start again you DO should the same! This is for coding errors. I know! But I won't post the mq4 formats because of sth but the most (some unfriendly people use it to fool others!) Tomorrow after elclasico I will explain more about it! Now Football time

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I loaded and it crashed MT4 when I applied to a chart. Now I can't even bring up my platform. Anyone else have a problem?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
That is OK on my chart.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Your version of MT must be the last one: 4.00 Build 409. Otherwise it doesn't work

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes, it crashed my MT4 too. But after I reinstalled MT4 everything works just fine. I created 3 templates, for M1, M5 and M15. Probably it would be more convenient to have just one template for all timeframes, but I felt that this indicator is kind of "heavy", so I decided to go with the individual templates.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I'm not so sure about Build 409. To reinstall my MT4 I got the new version from my broker, and it is Build 406, but it works just fine.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I have a little problem...... In my 15 min chart I loaded 3 indis. Current TF 30 Min 60 Min Bur 30 Min is always green....!?!? What is wrong?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
shahrooz67, thank you very much for the indicator! Looks very interesting and very promising. I'll test it for a while. I look forward to you posting your rules, but once again: take your time, post them when you're good and ready!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
It is strange. My M-15 looks right. Are you sure you did everything Shah told us to do? Going to H-1 and M-30, clicking on all three indicators?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I think you made a mistake and in the "Inputs" said "300" instead of "30" (I tried 300 and now it is all blue) or something like this.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
The good news: the indicator doesn't repaint. The good news: M-1, M5, M-15 and even H-1 look very profitable. The bad news: if you put SL at the recent hi/low, the H-1 SL and even M-15 SL would be too big. So I think I'll have a fixed SL, something like 15 pips for M-5, 20 pips for M-15.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I got sick and tired of 3 templates for 3 timeframes, and I wanted to work with H-1 too, so I created a universal template for all the timeframes.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Shah, thank you, i will be 1 of your follower. hi everyone.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Nice Job, Thanks!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Great. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I said before ! when you want to use a timeframe indic like m30 on m15 ,you should first switch to m30 let all data download of your brooker then switch back to m15 and then again right click on m30 indic select indic properties and at last click ok ! this will do fine

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I haven't talked about correct Sl and Tps yet my friend ! but if fixed tp and sl suits you comon do your best

--- 帖子 #61 ---
] Hey guys I am not sure whether this problem will be solved by a build 409 or not but all my platforms are on the same 409 i am using this indic on 5 pc and 1 laptop and all work nice

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I am not so sure about these ! but my little fx experience tells me if you want to use a MTF system try to select the closest time frames together ! personally myself trade this ! M1/M5 just for eurusd M5/M15/M30 eurusd,audusd,gbpusd,usdjpy M15/M30/H1 eurusd,audusd,gbpusd,usdjpy,nzdusd,eurjpy,gbpjpy M30/H1/H4 all expeect too wide spread pairs on my brooker H4/D1 all D1/W1/M1 all

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi, Sorry for that stupid question, but i cant find indicator .ex on my metatrader. I have install it on experts/indicators...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Favorite, Maybe You could help me to creat a universal template with all indicators in the same window. I ´ve done it with 4 $hah + indicators defining the maximum and minimum values​​. But I do not know how to do with the 15 indicators. See the image below. Thank you

--- 帖子 #65 ---
The indic is't too heavy my man ! i am sure that is much simpler than most of indics published during years ! believe me ! just because of my lack of knowledge in coding these errors will occurs ! maybe i will post the mq4 format later! and for you Favorite ! you are doing good and great ! but there is no need to publish what you are doing with my name like shah-template it is up to you man you are struggling and you can name it what ever you want My name is shahrooz .please just call me with this ( i am so so sensitive with my name , think it is a sickness for me )

--- 帖子 #66 ---
you are doing a nice job ! why don't you post your template ?!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I’am going now to post you a very very interesting Position which is a real textbook example M30 AUDCAD Yesterday when I was taking this I was in doubt myself ! but as you see it worked! Price 1.06549 was turning point for 13:30 23-1-2012 (GMT+2) But it was first hit on 4-12-1994 WOW ! and a turning point after on 28-7-1996 Look at charts

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I forgot it! kkkkkk But I could not create a universal template as the favorite did. This template is for TF15 minutes. I use parabolic, daily data V3 and THV3 ATR indicators. I hope it's useful. Bye

--- 帖子 #69 ---
That works ok .! what is the problem then ?! I think you are using synergy or something similar also

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Close and reopen the metatrader hope luck

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Ok, we have the indi now, but we have to know what are the "Real" Turning points we must look at...... Monthly, Weekly &amp; Daily Swings are enough? Or must we take care also of minor swings? Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I will post all priorities in few days! But touch Points are valid for any any time frames! Even M1 ,but there are levels of high priorities . I Should first do explain the Waves theories then mathematical reasons and at last going to final step I hope tomorrow (Iranian Official weekend),Saturday an Sundays which market is closed I can do that

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Sorry, I forgot to say that. I use MA CANDLES... Bye.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
با تشکر از دوست... Oooops, here it's swiched left &amp; right.......

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thank you shahrooz67 for sharing your indicator.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Shahrooz, thank you for your kind words, you are such a nice guy!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Forex Girl, it is a very good idea, but I think the only way to do it is to have one separate window for each timeframe. So we will have 9 windows instead of 3 windows and 24 indicators instead of 15 indicators. But you're right, it looks much nicer, and, of course, Shahrooz is absolutely right - this indicator is not heavy. So please take a look at this template and add the indicators you like.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
improbable, try opening and closing MT4. If you still cannot see the indi in your indicators folder, that means that the MQL compiler does not recognize your .exe file. In that case, you probably are not runn ing Build 409. Go to the Help/About pulldoown and see what build you are runnung. Upgrade to Buikd 409 and it should work This is my first post -- thank you to shahrooz67 for sharing this interesting indi.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Shahrooz, it is just for the testing purposes, when you post your rules and money management I will switch to your TP and SL. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
You´re Right. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Really interesting

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Shahrooz, you're right, but in my opinion the modern Iranian culture kick butt too! For example, one of my favorite books is "My Uncle Napoleon" by Iranian author Iraj Pezeshkzad! I've never read anything like this, it is a real masterpiece, one of the best ever! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Uncle_Napoleon

--- 帖子 #84 ---
What i meant about the culture is going to get better during past 50 years ! i have read that book also there was a movie on it ! thank you for your kind glance toward iranian culture .

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Ok dear friends please start posting your trading (or backtesting results here using the indic) to continue the following post i am going to post the positions i took today

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Here is my scalping trades on eurusd M1/M5 Total tp = +63 Total SL=-19 Net Profit = 44 Pips

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Dear Shahrooz, It would have been Better for all of us followers here , If you would put your trades here when you execute please. So we can learn at what point you entered n made money!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Nice job... Some questions.... Your TPs are the next Turning Point lines? Why did you took the -6 pips loss? Coz price went down.... Why did you use only 2 indis instead of 3? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
DearBehman I read somewhere in a forum that when you are trading focus 150 % for your trading ! perhaps there are professional traders here who can do both trading and posting but this is out my ability ! indic won't repaint so you can turn times to the trades and see the results !

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Tps and sls are the most positional zones , (M5/M15/H1 Fractals HERE)i mean the -6 pip loss is for trend changing and 2nd it has passed complete a touch point line ! when scalping i use M1/M5 indic because m15 means it should compare 15 candles of m 1 that is too high ! for a MTF system i prefer to use a maximum 8-10 range candles except perhaps (perhaps) day trading which use weekly and monthly (again perhaps ) look at these ! M1/M5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 M5/M15/M30 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 and 6 D1/W1 &gt;&gt; 7 Please read completely previous posts especially ravie Guidance

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Dear Shahrooz: What is the trading rule(s)? what is buy or sell signal based on your indicator? how use the horizontal lines drew based on ziz zag indicator for trading? please first describe about signals then share pics for better scenes. thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
the trading rules havn't published yet ! i have just postet the indicator because of asking the people or even the private messaging which they accused me to a person who wants to sell anything ! So now anyone can trade with the indic with its rules ! i siad before green = bullish , red=bearish black =side yes they are touchpoints

--- 帖子 #93 ---
dear you mean green dots for three time frames appear simultaneously means Buy? and the same scenario for the red dots is valid? then would you please describe more about points that marked by vertical red lines please note at a moment you do not know about future dots. thanks

if i understand correctly your question , in my ravie the first line from left is valid and then agian 6th candle before the forth vertical line was another sell position

i know i was lazy today for posting anything but today was a busy line for me . Je suis Desole this is another successful trade for today Good night all

Thx for sharing Man

I'm going to work on more details in 2 days before that, Seems there is an obligation to make some comments about the ZIGZAG indic Settings. As I said before there are three factors which handle this indicator . ExtDepth =10 ExtDeviation =2 ExtBackStep =3 But what are these factors and why these number ?! Ext Depth is the key factor in my opinion but why ?! Because as the Metatrader MQL help says it is : Number of periods (in direction from the start bar to the back one) on which the calculation is carried out. That means for finding a top or bottom it analyze 10 candles and then picks them . But why ten ?! I ‘am not going to print the Hand math calculations here ( I think there is no need for that and here is not a math forum ) But just you should know this ten ! As you may know when we have a turning points anywhere in the world, the derivation of its function in that point will tend to get close and closer to zero! So that, the function I have used to modelized the charts will make something Like this Y*(1-Log x) That X=ExtDepth Y= A*Sin(Mθ+Ω1) + B*Cos(Nθ+Ω2) Which A and B = amplitude M=angular frequency Θ=Current Wave Position in Radian And Ω1 and Ω2 are the difference in phases of two Waves ! Any way As Y needs Prediction of future and very very very hard calculation of Phase Calculating and at least i can not do this. The Phrase in the Prentices should equal to Zero to simpilfy every thing So cooz Log 10 = 1 then X = 10 ExtDeviation =2 It can be the numbers between 0 to anything you would like but as higher it gets we have lower range of freedom for our calcs I have considered it to be 2 (It should be selected by the range of the pair ). As the Name of these factor has a deviation on it it is clear its duty ExtBackStep =3 Look at these : for(back=1; back&lt;=ExtBackstep; back++) { res=ExtMapBuffer2[shift+back]; if((res!=0)&amp;&amp;(res&lt;val)) ExtMapBuffer2[shift+back]=0.0; } As you all know this can be considered as modifying Block it backs to our First Guessed Geometrical Function As I considered this ravie as a Totally Geometrical Wave pattern modeled which uses two main Shape Called Triangle and Ellipse BakcStep Should set to 3 Why ?! Because you need to three Point to draw A triangle and an ellipse you say no ?1 Ok Try IT Seems there are too many grammatical and spelling problem in this text, I wrote it too fast

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Guys, I'm sorry that I kind of "disappeared". Some family matters, everything is OK, but I couldn't trade Thursday-Friday because my relatives are visiting me . I think I will be able to start testing on Monday or Tuesday. I look forward to reading Shahrooz's posts during weekend!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
No More Theory will be published tomorrow i will explain the Touch Points and their periorities. after that my rules will be posted and at last my request . Lots of speech cause harm

--- 帖子 #102 ---
For some reason after downloading the indicator and attaching it on One Financial MT4 platform, the MT4 platform wont start.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Upgrade your platform to build 409

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I try to make it real easy! No Theory No Math and No Other Damn Science. I make it some Romantic there are three levels of Priority to rank these levels Based on true historical data on any pair and also the old comment on Resistance and Support levels when a Resistance or support one touches more than another one it is more valuable. This case is also valid in touch points but with a little difference (remember me to describe the difference please)! I call it Number of Market and Beloved Price Dates (As it gets more and more they will know each other better and they can trust each other more! Seems Market loves Polygamy ) The Second factor is Priorities of High Time frame. It is not as much as Global as the first factor but in a matter of equality number of dates of two different touch points, the one which appears on a higher time frame is the most valid one! This is called Higher Time Frame Level And the Last and the most important one is: If a Beloved has not been met for a long time the market missed it more, and tends to kiss it as soon as possible. For Example if we had a turning point on A last week, and the market has gone wildly higher than Price A For the rest of the week and never met Again A, since the first appearance Of Turning point A, When it comes to a reverse trend and bearish market, Price A has a Good Positional to attract The market Attention again. I call this Market Nostalgia So Let’s Rank the names as the levels of Priorities 1-Market Nostalgia 2-Number of Market and Beloved Price Dates 3- Higher Time Frame Level

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Ok Guys I have got four Touch Point indics coded by myself based on ZigZag indic 1-MTF Short Time Frames 2-MTF Long time Frames 3-MTF Long Time Frames Range 4-Current Time Frame I do the Levels by hands right now and it takes me lots of time . "Can anyone give me a hand to Modify them and make them set the priorities As it was commented on previous post ?!"

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Before the Complete Progression of Touch Point Indicator it is time now to describe somehow about the entering signals of the MTF $hah 210 ravie . when I started first to publish this Ravie for my friends plenty of them said how do you filter the wrong signals ?have you got a big oscilloscope ?! I answered them No I use a tool, an old one! I have heard the use of this tool in an Iranian FX Forum ( before the prohibition of Activity of FX brookers in Iran). As I said before this ravie is totally based of Geometrical shapes ! Especially Ellipse and triangle! Ok what is our filter?! Yes you are right Triangulation is our effective filter But what is triangulation? So easy! the appearance of TWO sides of a triangle which will be formed on the highs and lows of candles (each side of a triangle is shaped by three highs or lows) Look at the examples below to find how these triangles will be formed

--- 帖子 #107 ---
But how these lines will help us to do the trading?! At first I should confess Sth. The indicator is based on these high and lows ! Triangulation but is not as accurate as these lines ! What I mean ?! Simple, If I could always draw these lines correctly I were the richest man on the planet (believe me by backtesting and the power of these triangles). As you can see in the previous image when a side will break (if the side was really side) the Market will continue its trend to a specific location this location can be one of these : first a formation of another Triangle or reaching to the side of a bigger triangle and second : reaching to a touch point level. Ok as you know there are always hands higher the hands ( means, always there is a stronger Wave than a Wave).So we should always try to distinguish the strongest viewable Triangle. You Can see the Image below

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Now you ask why don’t you use these simple triangulation job to get the enter signals?! Again Easy answer! Because it is really hard to distinguish the higher Priority triangle when trading! It is easy in backtesting because you see the future but in forward testing it is really tough.Try It I remember a period for 30 days when I tried real hard to distinguish better and better, but I got no more than 60% accuracy to find the most valid ones.I Called a small account because of bad money management with this strategy. Perhaps there are more experienced traders who can find the best triangles or channels or trend lines with much more accuracy. But for me, it wasn’t easy enough. Then I tried to find a way to overcome this failure , and it leads me to achieve a good formula which can model these triangles better , then I coded the indic $hah+ with these formulas ( Very Easy ones). But as you know modeling a real thing is not 100% correct and it lacks some accuracy. So I will mix these triangulation with the Indic to reduce the wrong signals as many as possible.The most valid triangulation will be appeared after the signal of indic ( but need some comparing ability to find the best signals)

I'm really enjoying your teachings shahrooz67. Please stay encouraged

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hello Shahrooz, First I would like to say that you really have much knowledge. I am enjoying your explanations. I'm learning a lot. Thanks for that. You are tottaly right when you said: " Simple, If I could always draw these lines correctly I were the richest man on the planet..." . But, this is my question: Is it possible to create an indicator which can identify triangles patterns and draw trend lines? I'm a fan of Elliott Waves theory. As you said earlier the analysis of these triangles patterns are similar to elliott waves. Am I right? If I am right, it would be possible to refine existing code/indicator for the elliot waves and adapt them to the triangulation?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Salute Madmoisselle first of all thx for your kind words. Yes every thing which has a similarity to the Waves is similar to the Elliot Waves. You know they are all the same in a Public case : Wave ! But for your question i doubt if i can or anyone else code an indicator which tell you all the exact waves . what i did during past year was just Trial and errors to guess a formula to modelize sth to be similar to our pattern and triangulation They are not exactly what triangles do but they are just a similar pattern of them. Seems you know very well about Elliot Wave because you are also familiar with triangles As you know one of the best ways to predict the number of Elliot waves and the ranking of them is using the Triangles etc. that was very good suggestion for adapting an Elliot Wave indicator to triangulations but i am not really expert in coding and programming . but i guess it works and what i have all talked about during these posts were almost about Wave Theories ( not exactly the Elliot) Elliot Waves are special forms of hundreds of waves models,they could have been wisely adapted with the market. This theory is really interesting and fully developed; if you can distinguish them they are really awful. But as you know it is difficult. what I have tried during past year was completely about working on the Waves and the First sources Only, not exactly Elliot Waves which they have passed their exams before .

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thx man . I am doing my best to fullfinish all i did in a year to post here in 2-3 days . Regards Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #113 ---
first of all i should thank a guy who gave me the idea to work on the triangulation his name is khamsi and i do not know whether he has sucseed in his way or not , i do not know what was exactly his method but i do know he was working on fractals as mathematical issue. i changed my way and came up with some more physics in the waves . But there are some points in the triangles: 1-they are good geometrical shapes to form fractals because they will keep the angles and length of the sides when changing the size and the size factor 2-when you identify a triangle you should expect the candles to get more and more shorter when they are reaching to the head of the triangle ( the intersection point of two sides) 3-each triangle can be a part of bigger triangle 4-breaking of a side means the movement of the Price to the direction of breaking 5-if the candles go through the head of triangle , the triangle you have drawn is totally wrong(i have heard this of khamsi and found it correct)

Me too

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Shahrooz, I opened a mini account and start trading using your system. Please feel free to criticize and correct my mistakes. Below is my first analysis of triangulation. If my triangle is correct, then the price will break the bottom or top of triangle line. I realize that actually the candle size decreased as they approach the intersection point of two sides (as you´ve said: "the candles to get more and more shorter when they are reaching to the head of the triangle") . Fantastic . So, if the Shah indicator shows blue and price break top triangle side, I enter buy. But if the Shah indicator shows red and the price break bottom triangle side, I enter sell. Finally, if the candles go through the head of triangle, my triangle is wrong (but I think It will be sell). Please, give me a feed back. This is my first understanding. P.S.: Sorry for my bad english! I´m from Brazil. Thank you!

WOW , From BRAZIL!! Land of Soccer , i'am crazy about your country , My brother more , he is ready to gives his two hands to visit once Brazil. About your account , if you have an extra money that is nice work but i strongly recommend please let me finish my rules and strategy then use this ravie if you found it usefull for your self. there is real real good idea behind the height shortenings of candles when reaching to the top ( Real Strong) and it always does . you look smart and you have a good comprehension of what i have said before but let me tell you sth. your triangle is not completely true. Attached i have used an improved indicator which will help you to analyze better the market . i will post it soon($hah+ oscilator) then i was asleep and sorry for my late in answering but as favorite has said you could have entered it sooner if you have drawn the triangle better. The touch points accidentally the last turning points would have been the best ones . Look at the pic below P.S.: Your english is much better than mine

--- 帖子 #133 ---
As I have already said, defining the best triangles are piece a cake in back testing but in forward testing it is really hard. That is why I have used indicators! And As I said more than 200 times the indics are trying to model these shapes. But let’s put these indics aside for a while. Make your chart as clean as possible Select any time frame any pair How to set up your chart is written in the pdf attached. Then try to find a good triangle anywhere. Continue your sides to intersect each others. Then Ellipse form Insert&gt;Shapes&gt;Ellipse You should draw the ellipse this how (just this how) First priority: Group 1 First point is at the intersection of triangle sides then drag it to reach to a top or bottom which is next to the shorter side (it should be the past point which the side is based on it) and at last again drag your ellipse to the longer side points(again the last point). If you couldn’t draw this kind of ellipse you should try the Group 2 Second priority: Group 2 First point is at the intersection of triangle sides then drag it to reach to a top or bottom which is next to the longer side (it should be the past point which the side is based on it) and at last again drag your ellipse to the shorter side points(again the last point). Now if you have even drawn your triangle not completely correct, you can distinguish the trend ! Look at the second ellipse ! it has a false bear break down but it has not passed the ellipse ! If you want to filter the wrong signals you should take the pos later but for sure ( perhaps it passes plenty of its way and the tp gets shorter) So the price should pass through the Ellipse to confirm the trend !

Shahrooz, if I were you I would open a little new thread with your request in the "Platform Tech" section: http://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69 Coders/programmers visit "Platform Tech" section regularly, your request overthere would get much bigger exposure.

Hi folks! Just curiious. With regards to the triangles. Could the DeMark Line Indicator be used to automatically draw the most recent triangle? Just looking for a way we know our triangles are correct. Sharooz, your thoughts?

Yeahhh, Brazil is a soccer paradise.... We have a good soccer players aroud the world even in your country. I love Soccer ( in portuguese is futebol). The Brazilians are excited about the World Cup 2014. You are welcome to visit my beautiful country. About my account, I´ve opened a micro account with only $ 30. I do not like to trade with demo accounts because they do not test my emotional. I'm not a disciplined trader, yet. Thank you for your concern. So, I´ll add here my account evolution or involution and some trades. I'm waiting for the rules, but I´m using your indicator and some theories have placed here. I´d like to know if you will explain how to draw touchpoints. Grata (Thank you)....

Simple Answers 1-Demark tries to draw lines in any cases , even side markets. most of the time it is always trying to find sth , So it has many many false signals. 2-Demark uses more candles to analyze the market, and obviously it misses many opportunities. we use fewer candles to analyze the market 3-when the market is vague we are not going to draw triangles but demark looks for signals as shown in the picture the problems with Demark tool is clear and in this case I believe we should not draw triangles but if we want to ( I repeat this triangle is not so valid) draw one, It should be sth like the pic “triangle” . But if you want Demark decides for you and help you for draw triangles, perhaps it can do this in some cases Regards Shahrooz

guys i'm going to finish this probably tomorrow. by the way ! did anybody use $hah oscillator+ ?! Any problem in loading or something similar ?! please let me know about the feedbacks

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Shahrooz, I downloaded the oscillator, everything works just fine, no problems. But to use the oscillator we will need your instructions. Your first indicator MTF_$hah is great (thanks a lot!), especially on M5 and M15, but the oscillator changes the color the same time MTF_$hah changes the color, so we have to pay attention to the size of the oscillator's bar and I'm not sure I understand how to do it the right way.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I agree with Favorite. I´m using only MTF_$hah and I think is great....

--- 帖子 #167 ---
yeah you are right, as i said in post # 1 trading with $hah + is easier but the oscillator works better. i will surely explain about how it works and how we should trade with it , but i want to make sure it will work on your platforms too as good as mine . is there any bugs or errors with it during working or not?!?! please give me some time , today was a real busy day for me , i didn't trade for whole day just playing with the touch point indic. it is going to an end now. i will keep posting tomorrow or on friday to describe every thing. thank you for your patience and try to send your comprehensions of the indics and even your rules.It causes new ideas comes up ! wish lucks Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Please drop the Oscillator on your charts just for testing NOT trading .and let me know if any problems occurred. very thx for your Corporations. A bien tot

Keep up the good work!! Loved your explanation on drawing ellipse on extreme points, the oscillator kicks ass.. this MTF approuch looks solid. Greetings from Portugal

--- 帖子 #175 ---
ok guys. technically the indic is over but it can be better . i am not a computer engineer or sth but i think this indic is quite heavy . when drop it on your chart it takes some seconds to load completely please just be patient. i am too tired to post any thing else tonight. real busy day. Gym,University and playing more than 5-6 hours for this indic but this the template i will use for trading plus the indicators needed . i use just an extra synergy bars to visualize better the market not anything matter. please let me know again about the indic and the template (Necessary ) Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Is this way It should be? It seems good to me. It took few seconds to load but it´s fine.... Are you not using MTF Shah+ ? Great Work. Take a break and have a good night ! Bye. ..

When you decrease the number of candles you may miss several touch point levels

--- 帖子 #182 ---
guys when i drop the $hah+ touch point on the charts when it is going to a new candle forms, my platform will freeze for 3-4 seconds then run again. so if i put this indic on m1 chart we have 3-4 seconds freeze for each 1 minute but for ex , 1 hour chart 4-5 seconds freeze it is not much per hour ! i have posted a mq4 format of $hah touch point . is there anyone who can develop the codings better ?!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Shahrooz, When you´ve created this thread you clicked the 'Yes! post a poll' checkbox at the bottom of the page. You may also want to specify a time limit for the poll, so that (for example) it only stays open for voting for a week. Maybe if you change this time limit.... Bye

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Before going to post anything about the rules, It is better now, to make things clear about touch point indicator. Please read these two posts very carefully. t hen if you have enough informations about the last posts we can start trading with the $hah 210. As you have definitely noticed, touch point levels are formed in different time frames and all of them are valid. but there are priorities among them. it is much more clear than a sunny day that higher time frame are prior to the lower ones. I have already talked enough about these priority levels in post #104 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...38#post5335138 but let’s go over this in brief again. How we group these levels are based on 3 categories. 1-Market Nostalgia : if a level has not touched for a time market has more tendency to kiss it as soon as possible. 2-Number of Market and Price Rendezvous : if a level has more meeting with the market,(the level was touched more) It is a better known zone for the market and the market TRUST this level more. 3-Higher time Frame Priority: Obvious The coding of $hah touch point indicator is based on these priorities. For making it simple, it was tried to make them in three groups. 1-High time frames (Monthly, Weekly and Daily) 2-Medium time frame (H4, H1 and M30) 3-Low time frames (M15, M5 and M1) &lt;&lt; this one has not posted yet. But how should we use this lazy indicator: Guys it depends to your money management and risk management strategies. What ?!?!?! Be patient for a while and everything becomes clear. First of all we should all know that we cannot predict the market but we can study her behaviors.(I believe market is heaven girl LOL ) The nostalgic levels are stronger than the others and there is no difference on which time frame they appeared for example if we have a nostalgic level of M1 and nostalgic level of Monthly close each other they have both equal strength. But for the levels which are called TOPO ( To uch Po int) there ARE priorities between them. And what is these priorities : 1-if we have two close same time frame TOPO level the one with more numbers of dates is more valuable(the one which has been touched more ) 2-if we have two close different time frame TOPO level, the one with the higher time frame is prior (in case of close TOPO levels and different time frames both levels are almost equal in numbers of dates.) (To be Continued)

--- 帖子 #185 ---
When you want to use $hah touch Point : First of all please drop them on charts as the time frame priority 1-monthly, weekly, daily 2-H4, H1, M30 3-M15, M5, M1 When you use these three Indic together it is obvious you have a fully crowded lines . Perhaps it causes you to be confused. So I will make a suggestion for you to avoid confusing. Use the chart of a current time frame with the same and higher time frame touch point levels NOT lower ones. For example if you want to trade on H1 just use (Monthly, weekly, Daily, H4 and H1). It causes missing some Touch Point level but at least you won’t die of getting confused. But how should we set this heavy lazy Indic use?! As Pic shown in post # 187 we have 5 different factors to handle this indicator: ZigZagDepth : As you surely have noticed this indicator is based on the cute indicator ZigZag. and as I said before, This Factor, to find the best modeled fractals and tuning points MUST be set to 10. Refer to post #98 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...69#post5331969 candles : it is the number of the candles in which we are going to find turning points and fractal shapes . As it is clear, the more the number of the candles, the more Touch point levels. It is the number of the candles on the current time frame chart! For higher time frames or lower time frames , if there is enough candles it calculate as the number of candles which we assigned ,if enough history isn’t on the chart, it uses the present candles on the chart at the desired time frame. Deviation: To keep the indic both trustable and light enough we use this factor and what it does is simple. If two TOPO level (touch point level) in same timeframe, are as the amount of Deviation in pips close to each other the one with the fewer market meeting will be deleted. So ay we make the range of deviation higher we have fewer levels on our charts and Vice-Versa. Nostalgia Deviation: It works just Deviation But it does the same work among nostalgia levels in a same time frame not TOPO levels.( if we set it to zero it is better , because nostalgic levels are always valid even in close ranges). Tf_deviation : As its name says, it does the same works like the two last factors but this time among two TOPO levels for different time frames. If two TOPO levels with different time frame appear next to each others as the amount of tf_deviation in pips .the one with the fewer time frame will be deleted.

$hah Touch Point Set up box

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Guys please read these posts very carefully especially the guys who have fewer experience . they are all real important infos to use this system. Post # 1 – 14 – 15 -18 – 29 – 36 – 39- 44 – 49 – 54 -59-62-65-67-86-90-98-104-106-107-108-113-133-142-175-184-185 I suggest after publishing the rules we send all of our trades using this system For mine, i will post my statements either.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Before anything please make sure you have fully studied the posts mentioned in post # 188. I won’t guarantee anything, if you use this or any indic or method posted in this thread the risk is on your own. Before trading real please make sure you have tested this ravie on a demo account and you have gained good pips with it. During the trading please follow just to your rule. No emotion allowed. no matter what happens just stick to the rule. It is better not to trade during news. It is highly recommended try to use triangulation breaking to filter the market noises. I TRY to do it by my eyes because when scalping drawing triangles, takes your time. For now ,before fully development of the $hah Touch Point indic, I will drop these indic on my chart and then remove them ( the levels will stay after removing indic by this two versions which I will post with the name at the last * for trade) it causes we get higher speed on our platforms , just pay attention to update them sometimes. This system has looser positions too. You should be ready for them and try to decrease them. THIS IS A Multi Time Frame system . This system needs good information about FX, Platform. We should be sharp enough in FX and this is not excepted for this system too! What we use in this Ravie : $hah Oscillator + or $hah + ZigZag $hah Touch Point (different timeframes) Triangulations Candle Patterns Money Management: Never invest in a trade more than what you effort to lose! A good money management can make you a multi millionaire and a bad one can easily … your packet . Mine, For each 100$ in my account, I take 1 micro lot position. If i have a 10k account I take 100 micro lot equal to 1 lot ! Take profit and stop loss: Take Profit = TOPO levels or Nostalgia levels , If they are too far from what I expect from the position I will Break even or trail stop the position. Attention: we have always lots of option for our Take Profits and taking these levels is based on priorities of touch point levels and your expectation of the position. Stop Loss =According to our money management we can put it on the last high or low or equal or twice the tp range. Highly recommend to use Stop loss, although usually we exit our looser positions before hitting the stop loss. Pairs: All Time Frame: ALL Attention : based on the time frame we want to trade on it is better to have logical MTF Selection. M1/M5 – M5/M15/M30 – M15/M30/H1 – M30/H1/H4 – H4/D1 – D1/W1/(Monthly) If it is a three MTF, I call it 3MTF like M15/M30/H1 And if it is a two MTF, I call it 2MTF like M1/M5 Note that we take positions after closing of a candle and at the opening of next candle (not during candles) Long Entry signal: 1- If 2MTF : both first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Green and they both should be more than the previous amount. If 3MTF: first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Green and the third one should not be red ! all the 3 MTF $hah Oscillator should be more than the previous amounts. 2-A healthy Body Bullish candle has appeared. 3-Good candle Patterns appearance (not necessary) 4-A supposed triangle should have been broken to upside. 5-the length of the candle should not be more than we except to earn pips of the current position. Points on long: if the indicator has signaled us very late (2-3 candles later than a broken supposed triangle) that positions should not be taken or with a smaller take profit. Engulfing patterns are the best patterns Short Entry signal: 1- If 2MTF : both first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Red and they both should be less than the previous amount. If 3MTF: first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Red and the third one should not be green ! all the 3 MTF $hah Oscillator should be less than the previous amounts. 2-A healthy Body Bearish candle has appeared. 3-Good candle Patterns appearance (not necessary) 4-A supposed triangle should have been broken to downside. 5-the length of the candle should not be more than we except to earn pips of the current position Points on short: if the indicator has signaled us very late (2-3 candles later than a broken supposed triangle) that position should not be taken or with a smaller take profit. Engulfing patterns are the best patterns Exit Signals: 1-TOPO or Nostalgia levels reached. 2-reverse candle patterns appearance 3-a new forming triangle appear 4-in short positions : If 2MTF : both first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Green and they both should be more than the previous amount. If 3MTF: first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Green and the third one should not be red! all the 3 MTF $hah Oscillator should be more than the previous amounts. In long positions : If 2MTF : both first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Red and they both should be less than the previous amount. If 3MTF: first and second $hah Oscillator + should be Red and the third one should not be green! all the 3 MTF $hah Oscillator should be less than the previous amounts. Attached, there are some entry position signals I have taken, shown. For better monitoring I have removed Touch point levels of the chart.

And this is all the indicators you need wish luck Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I'm using this indi (i have only ex4) as filter, it shows me trend and doesn't repaint! ! ! In combination with shah+ works perfectly for me :-)

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Shahrooz, you gave us a lot of information, we have to "digest" it, so you probably won't get any feedback immediately. Shahrooz, once again thank you very much for your time and efforts, for this great system, for your patience and for you being such a nice guy!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
hi there. if you can find the mq4 format it is a great help. this one , in my opinion, signals too late. Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #194 ---
don't mention it, hope we all progress together.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Dear Friends Please ASK your question about the system just on the thread not through private messaging .I will answer them all i if I can even in private messaging , but perhaps your question is another one question , when his or her problem would be solved with your question and every one else can read the answers and questions. one of the biggest problem for all is how to distinguish the triangles : Yeah friends , i know this is the hardest point of the system but for filtering the signals i know nothing better than these triangles. ! and what it needs to be fully solved is practice and practice and practice. Suggestion : If you are not easy with trend line trading ,channel trading or triangle trading, I demand anyone if he or she uses any indicator or sth similar to combine with the system and he or she thinks it works, don't doubt to share it here with the others.Like the work Forex Girl or Pipinek did . any improvement in the system is welcome , and there is no problem for me to post it here.even a better system may rise up !

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I forgot to say When i had not enough skills about triangulation. I tried several indicators (leading or lagging) some were disaster with the system , some were bad , some were so so and a couple seemed nice. On of the best ones is the combination of Stochastic and QQE If any one cares , Just tell me to describe that. But t is highly recommended to use triangulation

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Shahrooz, I'll do my best to master the triangulation and I'm sure I will master it in a little while, but Stochastic is one of my favorite indicators, and I'm also very interested in QQE, last year I started gathering QQE info and the more I look at the QQE the more promising it looks. So I would really appreciate if you share your Stochastic/QQE "filtering" method when you have some spare time.

I should travel for 4-5 days ! I'am back on saturday. this Indic is a combination of QQE / stochastic mode! thx to the original QQE coder but it is modified by myself and i doubt if any one else has got it , but it is a simple one ! For training you can use a combination of QQE period 5 and stochastic periods 10,3,3 or 13 ,5,5 or 13,3,3 (i prefer these but not an obligation) When i am back i will explain more Wish luck Shahrooz

Yes, we would love the indicator and the instructions for its use. Thanks so much! SirWolf

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi Shahrooz67 Sorry as I'am still newbie, I have been searching what's the meaning of TOUCH POINT in this thread but it seems I couldn't found any of it...Could you kindly pls inform the link of the meaning of TOUCH POINT so I would have a better undrerstanding of it.. Many thanks...

--- 帖子 #224 ---
READ THIS CAREFULLY !!!!! Stop Hit ! but why !? it is a wrong entry (late one ) AS i said before the best filtering tool in this ravie is triangulation. an as i said after this point , (in the rules ) when we pass a triangle it is a time to enter the trade when it is 2-3 candles passed of breaking the triangle we have two choices : 1- Not to enter 2-Let the TP in tighter position Although in this pos i took number two but again my stop hit. i wanted to use QQE Stoch Combi Method as it is clear in the image attached , when QQE stoch combi signaled me i took the pos at once (white Vertical line) But as you can see in the Vertical line we had broken the triangle , and it was the place we should took the pos ! that means QQE / stoch combi is not as accurate as triangulation using ! in this case , we should have took advantage of + 29 pips and now we have a -27 pips this may happen normally but yet QQE stoch combi is a good one

--- 帖子 #225 ---
For sure I will do it in a few hours Shahrooz

my latest QQE/Stoch combi using Template attached all the indicators needed . this is a m5 template , you can adjust it for any time frame you want. make sure you know how to use $hah Oscillator + you can delete "$hah Touch Points for trade" after once you have dropped them on the chart. if not, they will cause freeze on your plat form and speed will reduce .

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hello Sharooz! As you know, I have been following your thread since day 1. Yet, I think I may have missed how the ZigZag indicator is actually used in trading this system. And I do not see it in the rules on the first post. Can you explain how it is used? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks for the indictor Sharooz! Can you give the specifics on how the QQE/Stoch indicator is to be used? Maybe update the rules to include this and the ZigZag. Thanks friend! SirWolf

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Lol I'm happy !! jealousy won't be a dam for a wild flood !

--- 帖子 #236 ---
As you know the method is based of Touch Point (TP and Sl levels ) we do not use ZigZAG in trading or to say better to get entry signals ! What they do is just to monitor swing highs and lows ! If you draw H Lines on turning points of ZIgZag indi (top and bottom) , they are our Touch Points ! where we can use them for TP and SL

--- 帖子 #237 ---
QQE/Stoch combi is consisted of 5 levels : 1- strong bear=The lowest line 2-weak bear=the last lowest line 3- neutral=middle line 4-weak bull=last highest line 5-strong bull=highest line when you want a short it should not be weak bull or strong bull and when you select long , it should not be weak or strong bear ! hope it is useful for now , but i will complete it in afew days

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Thank you for your kind words but in first image if you have used the trading with triangles you would not take positions number 2 and 3 from the left. any way , by using QQE-stoch combi they are completely correct positions if you try more , you can gain lots more pips Excellent Regards Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Shahrooz, Thanks again for your contribution. A question regarding QQE-Stoch Combi.ex4 when I drop it on a chart, my Mt4 platform freezes for a long time, and never gets better. Any idea how to sort this out? Maybe mq4 version? Best Wishes

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Dear Rojan2 try this version and let me know if it worked or not 1- for build 226 2-for build 409

--- 帖子 #263 ---
ALL the tp levels are hit very very accurately

--- 帖子 #264 ---
level three was going to be hot but it reversed and returned the trend ! the difference between or tp and the max price was just 3 pips ( very little for daily position) and this teaches me again a good lesson ! make some tolerences for your tp and sl because your brooker is a market maker ! i missed now a good 100 pips for just a three pips LOL if i had a 5% range for a 1oo pips ( 5 pips ) then i had 95 pips instead of a break even

--- 帖子 #265 ---
1 pos 1 winner =24 pips

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Please do read post one thank you

--- 帖子 #269 ---
that is because of a missing part indicator please put QQE.mq4 or ex4 file and QQE-stoch.ex4 in your indicators folder. this indic is based on them. Regards Shahrooz

Hi shahrooz, first of all, really great system...will test it next week. Just one question: I tried to create a template for the H4 time frame, so I adjusted the colors in the indicator "$ah Touch Point (H4-H1-M30) for trade" to "NONE" for M30 and H1. But this does not work correctly and the lines are still drawn in red, even if I change time frames or delete all objects and attach the indi again. Could you look into the code and correct this to make the lines adjustable in color? Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Thanks for the reply. Sorry I missed about that in the first post. Anyway, I like the system.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
You are welcome man, if you have any question about the system or any thing else I am ready here to solve if i can

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Nice to meet you man the indi has lots of problem(i mean the touch point idni) if i can i'am going to fix them in 2 or three days, But it seems a real programmer should fix it any way . I do my best to solve this

--- 帖子 #276 ---
hi i have read this thread as a guest during the second or third day of start, I wonder why won't you post your mq4 formats?!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hello Shah, I think the Oscilator repaints. I was just watching in on the 1min chart and the previous closed bars repainted. Have you noticed that? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hello there, Because the indi uses just and just the past closed bars, It WON'T repaint. keep an eye on it and you will understand what I say , I'am working with the $hah + for a year and the oscillator for two months and i never saw any repainting. when you drop the indi on your chart try this again : R.C on indi &gt;&gt; Properties &gt;&gt; Click OK to reload.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks Shah, I will monitor it for a while and see. Could be my mistake, sorry for that.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi Shah, Nice system. I have one problem with QQE-Stoch Combi 409 build. After I drop it, he never updates to next candles. Only if I change timeframe then back to it, I get the latest info, but again, it stops there. Any advice?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I did not understand the problem exactly.'

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Shah, I managed to solve the problem. I downloaded the latest “QQE-Stoch Osc” and the problem is solved. The one for the 409 built has a bug, see the image below http://i42.tinypic.com/foeulx.png Anyway, I want to speak with you privately so we can discuss a few things. My broker will be getting a five figure number in his account this Monday so I want you to test your strategy, since I can’t master it myself. I can’t send private messages, so I’ll leave you my email: candyriw [at] gmail.com if you’re interested.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi man I saw your image, and i do not know what caused this to your QQE-stoch combi but some points. First try to show me some examples of your comprehension of the method first then you will be able to send private messages (when your posts get to 5 or 7 ) I'm not sure Second you do not need to stochastic osciillators for this method , because they are already used in QQE_stoch combi third, My e-mail address is on indicator properties . and at last - post your Trix 4 time frame indicator here please so all of us can test it. Regards Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I didn't get anything with MTF Trix yet. Do not test it on history, repaints due to change of trend or something, on higher tfs. Test it only under your eyes. About your e-mail address, that awkward moment when you are too focused on charts and you don't see that e-mail in front of your eyes! ) Okay, I owe you an e-mail.

Not a suitable indicator with this system, It won't help us Thx for sharing

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hey guys, Has anyone tried to run this in simulator? I usually will test a new system(new for me) first in simulator simply because it makes a really good filter. After all if it doesn't profit in simulator then it will never profit in demo and for sure not live. Anyways when I run it in simulator, the current tf seems to work ok but on the other indis it seems to not change. For example I ran a test on 5m so I wanted current, 15, 30, and 60 min for the indi. The only one that changes it seems is the current one. That is to say that 15,30,and 60 all stayed green while current changed. I am attaching 2 charts to demonstrate what I am talking about. The first is the actual chart from sept 5 2011 and the second is the chart that was generated by simulator. As you can see the 15,30,and 60 never change on the simulator version and they do on the real one. Has anyone else had this problem?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
No offense, but it just proves that your simulator sucks...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Simple Answer: your simulator can not calculate MTF analysis , I doubt if there is any simulator with MTF analyzing Guys I'm around here to answer any question but for new posts give me some time Regards Shahrooz

--- 帖子 #293 ---
so silent looks. I am really wondered how can we replace the Triangle filtering to make this method real mechanical ( I emphasize that for mine , I do not use any other system to replace my lovely triangles but it is for the guys who love easy entering) during past year I have tried lots of indicators but just a few of them has passed a quality test. as i have said before QQE-stoch combi is one of them but As i mentioned in post 1 (before disappearing of the post ! ) I followed Taskay thread which CCI was the most important indicator in it. I thought i could replace the triangles with CCI for more than 95 % accurate data but it was not as accurate as i thought , It can filter wrong signals 80% for EURUSD, 79 % for GBPUSD, and 89% for GBPJPY. Anyway , I remember the day when i visited first ForexFactory by a google search and then right into the Sonic system thread,It was excellent for me and i followed the thread with an off light with 150% concentration. during these two or three weeks i again returned to my lovely thread Sonic and i saw its CCI indicator, you know there is other CCI indicator but i prefer to use this one as my cci indic. i have attached the indicator but how we use it in our thread is ! Long CCI (34) &gt;=0 Short CCI(34)&lt;=0 once again thx to sonicdeejay

As you wish. Just dragging trades from the history to the chart is 1) easier, 2) more clear, 3) more convincing. Lines belong to theoretical backtest not serious showing of real trades.

look at the third position which is filtered by our lovely triangles. I love it , Triangle!

Consider as no offense. I do not need any thing to prove ! read post #1 this is some examples of 5 guys trading this method. but all the post are sent by myself Just samples of trading , idics won't repaint , so you can back test it. I am not here to convince any one ! If you can not accept any thing you can use it not

--- 帖子 #304 ---
To be honest, I do not care if these are real trades or not. Of course, when someone shows trades with manually drawn lines then I always doubt. What is important - I have tested your indicator and IT IS GOOD. Maybe I will use it in real trading also but right now it does not fit to my system. But IT WORKS! Good job!

you have rights to doubt man ! I have discussed about my rules , may be you want to use any thing in other ways , naturally it is on your own risk , But according to your vouchers , it is obvious you are an experienced trader and you know posting chatting watching or any thing else during trading is completely harmful ! I tried a lot to post my most recent trades even the ones which are still open.But please pay attention . I live in Iran , lots of limitation like very low speed internet connection! i can not post anything any body wishes ! hope you understand me ! Wish luck Shahrooz

ive been looking at this system and been messing around with the indicator on different timeframes to see how it works and whats best i was just wondering is there any possible way to put an alert on the indicator so for example if it closes on a sell signal on 5m it alerts in the pop up box

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I am working on it

--- 帖子 #315 ---
thanks

Hi Shahrooz, I was playing with your QQE Stoch Combi as I like it very much visually - it is so different from usual stuff and looks really nice on chart. But what I noticed while changing settings was that it is basically just QQE, so that Stoch has nothing to do with it. At least, changing Stoch settings did not change anything in the indicator. Also I did find out that the best QQE setting for higher timeframes is 3 not 5. And on lower TF, especially M1 or M5 I would not use it at all.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I am very sorry man I have just checked my indicators sent in the thread. I have uploaded here wrong QQE-stoch indicator. so the QQE-Stoch combi shows wrong results ! I wonder how any one else has not discovered this before This indi is much dependent to Stoch K-Period and Slowing

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Here are the true versions And i think the best configs are stoch 5-3-3 qqe 3

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thank you! My choice for Stoch would be 8-3-3 but I will try 5-3-3 also. I trade only M30 and up, and on those TF the indicator is a very good tool for filtering out some bad trades. Lower than that it filters out too many good ones also.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
yeah for fewer time frames it is really harsh and too fast.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
try 10,3,3 on lower timeframe it is less harsh ive found

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hello, shahrooz67. Have you indis ($hah, $hah oscilator) for MT5? Regards, Den.
