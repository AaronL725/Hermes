Hi I have been asking to create separate thread so here i am. I'd like to thanks to arezab for porting this strategy to MT platform. Many of these informations u can find in my journal thread here which is closed and probably never be activated due lack of time.(maybe only long term trades one day we will see) Main advantages of this system. 1 Accuracy are providing by emas(7,14,34,52,120,204 and SMA100 for Oanda and 7,14,34,52,98,180,250 for MT4) and fibs. 2 Confidence has been achieved by momentum and StochRSI indicators(never lied to me only I interpereted in wrong way) [Oanda stochRSI settings are 65,70,30] 3 Scalability because it does work on all TF.(lower TF less TP) U can find template for MT4 in attachment below. (template was reduced to only important emas and should works very well for all brokers on MT4 pllatform.) First chart shows geppy daily TF StochRSI There are two important levels on stochrsi 0.25(25%) - bears territory border. 0.75(75%) - bulls territory border. EMA 20 and these two levels are providing strong S/R levels. Momentum On momentum EMA 100 shows trend direction and provides major S/R level. EMA 20 shows minor S/R level also provides acceleration of trend developement. If EMA 20 crossed EMA 100 we have a change of short term trend. We can easily call this "Death Cross" Second chart shows entries in trend continuation on 3H chart. We can easily follow the DC or to be more accurate and open trade when EMA 20 on momentum will change to resistance from support. To be yet more accurate switch to lower TF's and seek for divergences and 61.8%/76.4% fibo retracements. Targets TP and reversal point have been calculated on 261% FE of last correcton. This is only theory...and hard to apply to real life Questions ? Disclaimer : I just talk gibberish, dont take it personaly I dont know how to trade at all.

Hi 5ysfx. Nice system. What is your Money Management and how long have you been using this strategy in live account? thanks. forexsurgeon

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thanx for starting this thread. Will be of great benefit for a noob like me hoping to become a great trader like you guys on auslanco's thread. Just this dumb question please. where can i get all these indicators? Thanx once again

--- 帖子 #4 ---
MM is very simple im not greedy 50 pips SL = 1% all the time With many modification this system have been working since 2 years now. Final above version is little younger.(half year) All this charts was made on Oanda platform. If u would like to use on MT4 platform we have to wait for arezab . He has created these indicators on MT and maybe he paste them with template here. I hope he will do that.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Are you going to continue to post charts in your previous trading journal or only in auslanco thread?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Your former journal thread would have been named as for example "Astrology domain" lol completely waste of time - 18 40.91% - these were people who didn't know what astrology is lol

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Mate, seems that you did some re-adjustments to your targets during the weekend... I think there must be dozens of this kind systems presented in this forum. What makes this one better than the rest of them? R

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Mate i dont care if im right or wrong on longer term targets, i play what charts tell me atm thats all. After full retracement i will tell u next target. I dont know what make this better than other system let ppl judge. Maybe this: This strategy let u catch any move(up/down) on any TF start from 30 sec. Second thing i was asked to post this strategy what ppl will do with that is a separate issue.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I hope arezab come soooooooon , We are MT user and need that nice indicator..

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Looking forward to trying out your system in conjunction with my trading of PA. Thanks for sharing! Hopefully we can learn alot from each other!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
momentum divergence + borders use i think there is no need to explain just look at the chart and try figure out where was long and short signals . need some sleep so i will answer later for ur questions.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Nice start bro. I hope it's useful for everyone. Here is the template I made for MT4 ...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
thanks arezab. we are going to test it asap.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
OK i will help u a little below are 30 sec and 1 min chart and 15 min chart question ?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Since I see 5y uses Heiken Ashi candle stick charting style inside Oanda platform, I'm attaching the Heiken Ashi indicator for MT4 for everyone who is interested in. Mt4 doesn't offer this charting method. We have to use indicators for it. There are several versions of Heiken Ashi indicator for MT4 with different variations but this one is the standard one without any specific settings.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
m15 bearish mode m30 has changed to bearish 1H is changing to bearish add to short when m15 stoch will hit ema 20 for the first time and bounce to downside(u can watch it on lower TFs if will bounce or not looking for "borders fight" ) 143 should be good spot for short again m15 ema 14 if break then ema 34 next resistance 144

--- 帖子 #17 ---
correction was higher than expected all because m1 and m5 TF but higher the better entry for short we got check this out bulls have won at m1 this cause they have entered to bullzone at m5. m30 and h1 still bearish stochRSI's ema 20 provide resistance.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
if bears will win on m5 then on m15 bulls lose at stochRsi 50% level This mean strong sell signal if on m15 stoch's ema 20 will be broken . if all this will happen then on 1H bears win this day. Momentum is rising for bears camp watch m5

--- 帖子 #19 ---
bearish momentum divergence on m5 bounce off 61.8% FE bouce off bullzone border at m1 TL will be broken soon i hope so IMO must go down

--- 帖子 #20 ---
how do you overlay an indicator over the other using oanda platform, like you did with your Momentum and RSI indicator with moving averages. Thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
just left click on indicator and pick "add study" then u can choose some indicators like ema.sma, bolinger bands, Back to the subject ema 55 on m15 still holding but price is pretty bullish on m5 yet. we have to wait for clear signal when stoch will leave bullzone nad momnetum goes below ema 100.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
nice place to go short finally with less risk m5 bearish divergence m5 momentums ema 20 act like resistance m5 ema 204 first touch 261.8% FE has been hit (cyan fibo) m15 at bullzone border so shorted near FE 261.8% 14520 SL 50 pips above risk only 1 % lets see what will happen

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Keep going 5y ... I'm really following your posts and getting used to some concepts behind this system. It's really a nice work man. I appreciate your hard work and sharing. Though I must confess we are not facing an easy system but after a while we should be able to identify those healthy signals. I'm sure about that and I was when I saw your chart the first time.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
now we are in a battle stage SL moved to BE just in the case in 90% cases first break of stoch's ema 20 will stop at borders for awhile then there is a decision breakout or bounce.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
stopped out but shorted again higher at ema 204 1425 SL 50 pips again U can use lilmoe MM strategy to protect profit take half profit after 70-100 pips and put SL to BE. im just showing u basic stuff scalping on 30 sec chart is so fun Thanks arezab No need to rush is really hard to explain all this mixed stuff.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
second attempt to break bullzone border short still not confirmed yet

--- 帖子 #27 ---
stopped out at BE short again at 14605 SL is 50 pips but after 50 pips drop will be moved to BE immediately as usual reason is m30 ema 55 resistance H1 momentums ema 100 resistance (if break then we can see bigger retracement)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
stopped out at BE shorted again at ema 133 m15 14625 still waiting for clear signal on m5 momentum is dropped hard so maybe now wow breakout and my platform freeze nice Oanda very nice stopped out and sit on my hands

--- 帖子 #29 ---
i dont know why i try to short when i get long signals everywhere h3 supported at ema 20 (stochrsi) h1 in bullzone m30 in bullzone m15 in bullzone m5 in bullzone since 14280 just LOL i call this false start. lets short again at 147 ema 34 on h1

--- 帖子 #30 ---
now my short should be fine m1 in bearzone m5 is leaving bullzone keep open short unless UTL will be broken

--- 帖子 #31 ---
closed for 50 pips and short again at 14730 (strong resistance ema 14 on h3) m1 momentum was quite good to start downtrend m5 stoch is retesting ema 20 now

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Don't be biased!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
yep i just dont believe this system sometimes but its showing right direction since 14280 LOL btw stopped at BE will wait for another short signal

--- 帖子 #34 ---
i think this is it short 14750 bulls has been stopped at bullzone border im expecting 150 pips drop at least rest will depend on m5 setup

--- 帖子 #35 ---
m1 upside move rejections caused m5 good short setup as well but bulls still well supported on m15 m30 and h1. Also watch m5 whether bears will enter into bearzone like i said at least 150 pips drop momentum goes below 100 ema for first time since 142 this mean something

--- 帖子 #36 ---
no sign of battle on m5 and m15 bears took control completely moved SL to 14650 locked 100 pips and let it run for double bottom at least

--- 帖子 #37 ---
i can add short here higher will get in this retracement lower she fall

--- 帖子 #38 ---
price has been hit projected level but no sign of TP here moved SL to 14415(just little above m1 ema 14) locked 90 pips and let it run to 143 next projected TP m1 bearish m5 bearish m15 is changing to bearish m30 is changing to bearish h1 neutral h3 neutral

--- 帖子 #39 ---
stopped out for profit and shorted higher at 14450 m5 ema 14 first touch after ema7 break projected TP is 142

--- 帖子 #40 ---
higher she goes lower she falls added short at 14524 (m5 ema 204 and m15 momentum ema 20 resistance ) TP has changed to 141 now projected by 261.8% fibo expansion of current correction move

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Can you plse post the template for MT4. The one in prv post does not work. Thnx

--- 帖子 #42 ---
template for MT4 has been posted by arezab on first page.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
wanna send you a PM, got some noob questions i wanna ask. hope you would have the time.. could I?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
added to short at 14630 just little above fibo 61.8% and m15 ema 133 also m5 bullzone rejection The Watcher pls send email instead thx

--- 帖子 #45 ---
m15 strong sell signal bounce off bullzone border on m30 same thing m5 in bearzone already after bullzone rejection but h1 is bullish that is interesting momentum way above ema 100 stoch in bullish zone must be carefull with shorts and watch for 142 level

--- 帖子 #46 ---
another scalp signal but i do not follow i have enough open trades m1 bullzone rejection and bounce off fibo 50% of last wave down TP for this signal is 14160 161.8% FE

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Finally.. you open your own thraed.. this is the opportunity for me as a newbie to learn about your strategy..! great.. Thanks 5ysfx..!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
well rejection setup has failed bulls have been supported at ema 20 but price i still below 61.8% fibo and current wave looks like bear flag so should dive any minute.now.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Enjoy

--- 帖子 #50 ---
this is the way how i calculate TP if rejection will occur in specific TF.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
m1 long signal caused by rejection after TP will be hit is worth to try short of top around ~14550 there is chance for rejection on m5 anyway i will add to short its worth for me

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Sorry but that template does not open. Can you plse repost it. Thnx

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Here you go ...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
2 Confidence has been achieved by momentum and StochRSI indicators(never lied to me) &lt;--- This one sound like a lie to me if it is not you . You must have fail some how at least one or two times which is ever and not never. In fact you can be losing a lot until today. hehe tell me mate whats up with your trading now?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Morning fellas Its funny how m1 signal could be so strong to generate breakout on m5 m15 m30 and h1. Just one scalp signal but with trail stop could give small 600 pips. OK MM has been changed.i will do like lilmoes do Half TP after 50-100 pips then move SL to BE and wait for another scalp signal If price will goes above 100 pips of SL then trail SL just a few pips below m1 ema 14. This have to work perfect because signal on m1 have been generating twice an hour sometimes. Happy trading everyone. Thank to arezab i wont be biased anymore it just make no sense PS finally good spread on Oanda shorted at 14980 for 50 pips first half then trail with ema 14 or BE no stress anymore signal generated on m1 and possible m5 bullzone rejection

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Those indicators never lied to me but i read wrong signals sometimes and mistery is over . This setup always show right direction only my mind is biased sometimes thats why i could be wrong many times. Just check yourself how "rejection" will work if u would like Enjoy

--- 帖子 #57 ---
no money this time changed to long at 14990 because m1 bearzone rejection

--- 帖子 #58 ---
reversed position at 15010 m1 bullzone rejection again

--- 帖子 #59 ---
closed +50 half profit and moved SL to BE +10 m1 still in bearish zone and momentum is is rising for bears below ema 20 m5 near bullzone border so there is a chance of bullzone rejection and further dowside pressure. However we are in bullish trend m15 m30 and h1 in bullish zone

--- 帖子 #60 ---
shorted at 14960 m1 bearishzone border resistance and ema 20 break to downside this should mean bearish move confirmation.and m5 bullzone rejection

--- 帖子 #61 ---
closed all shorts long at 14950 m1 stoch left bearzone m5 stoch ema 20 support

--- 帖子 #62 ---
a little bit later... SL moved to BE

--- 帖子 #63 ---
man o man wth rollercoaster reversed to short at 15020

--- 帖子 #64 ---
big rejection on m5 SL at BE now

--- 帖子 #65 ---
took half profit at 14780 could bounce here im waiting for valid long signal

--- 帖子 #66 ---
yep bounce off closed all short positions bought at 148 m1 bullish mom divergence and stoch left bearzone

--- 帖子 #67 ---
this target would be nice

--- 帖子 #68 ---
It was just 100 pips higher than i thought and bounce off was great predicted by momentum on H1. Like i said system works but human has to made final decision

--- 帖子 #69 ---
took half profit at 150 moved SL below m5 ema 14 m15 is generating short signal waiting to go short for clear signal on m1 and m5

--- 帖子 #70 ---
it was quite quick m15 short signal stopped out for profit at m5 ema 14 short at 14950

--- 帖子 #71 ---
nope not now yet stopped out and long at 14990

--- 帖子 #72 ---
add to long at 15080 m1 mom's ema 20 first touch and should be good support m5 stoch in bullish zone

--- 帖子 #73 ---
added again at 15035 m1 bear zone possible rejection

--- 帖子 #74 ---
possibly target after rejection

--- 帖子 #75 ---
TP has been hit took some profit and moved SL to ema 14 on m5 waiting for new signal

--- 帖子 #76 ---
5ysfx, Thanks for sharing your method of trading. The play by play updates on the trades you're taking are very helpful. I took a scalp on EU last night using your system and it worked out great. One question, I noticed you've been using the EMA 120 instead of the EMA 133 as stated in your 1st post, do you recommend the EMA 120 now instead of 133?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
oops yes i did change to EMA 120 accidentaly to try it out. It is more accurate i think on most of TFs check chart EMA 120 is closer to tops than EMA133 Try different setup if u like. Cheers

--- 帖子 #78 ---
closed all longs and changed to short now at 156 261.8% target has been hit very powerfull reistance at ema 55 first touch of momnetums ema 100 possible bullzone rejection on h3 lower TFs still very bullish though

--- 帖子 #79 ---
took half profit at 155 and moved SL to BE waiting for short confirmation on m5

--- 帖子 #80 ---
m1 sell confirmation added to short at 15560 possible target for short is 15250 261.8% FE of current correction

--- 帖子 #81 ---
m5 short signal is generating momentum droped below ema 20 support stoch ema 20 is starting to act like resistance possible m1 rejection we will see EDIT stopped out and went long on double top breakout

--- 帖子 #82 ---
now i can easily short because we got divergence on m5 closed longs shorted at 15730

--- 帖子 #83 ---
took half profit on 15660 moved SL on BE and goin to sleep later over 1000 pips in one day is fair enough

--- 帖子 #84 ---
over 1000 pips in one day is fair enough

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Good morning I will stop to post entry/exit here. This shouldnt be journal only system disscusion . I will post only from m15 TF confirmed signals. I showed u the way. Please post here any question instead of emailing me. This will be better solution for all of us .Feel free to post ur chart here as well. Thanks for understanding.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Before London session will start i will be posting my heat map based on moms + stochRSI. Daily TF in bearzone and is approaching to border. (bearish but changing to neutral if will cross bearzone border and ema 20 resistance) H3 is in bullzone and momentum bounce off ema 100 (bullish but not confirmed yet because mom is still below zero level) H1 extremely bullish according to momentum (above ema 20) stoch sits on second support(bullzone border) after has been crossed ema 20. M30 has been generating sell signal but has not been confirmed yet.(ema 20 start to act like resistance.) M15 short signal has been generated (bounce off ema 20 resistance near bearzone border and entered bearzone convincingly also momentum is below ema 100 and making new low now= strong selling pressure) Conclusion Should be drop to 151-150 level to test TL then bounce off TL and make new high today/tommorow.Break of TL is unlikely but also possible so i will short below of it. Be carefull H1 is bullish and drop could be stop on H1's ema 55 or even ema 14

--- 帖子 #87 ---
thanks for forecast. It's amazing.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
LONG setup confirmed on H3 buy on dips. Short is dangerous.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Are your scalping or jast waiting?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
im working all the time but wont post m1 scalp anymore. This should be trading system thread not journal. I will reopen my journal in couple of weeks Thank you for patience and understanding.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
m1 rejection lets see how reliable this signal is

--- 帖子 #92 ---
m5 rejection was more powerfull

--- 帖子 #93 ---
another m5 rejection with rising momentum on m15 breakout soon

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Well Maybe this m1 rejection bring breakout ? m5 momentum and stoch found support at ema 20

--- 帖子 #95 ---
yep this time it was successful entry m5 in bull zone m15 breakout enjoy easy money

--- 帖子 #96 ---
15950-160(m1 ema 120 to ema 204) area should be good place to add some longs. h3 is bullish h1 is bullish m30 is bulish m15 is bullish m5 is bullish only m1 is bearish but this only dip any shorts will be short lived LOL

--- 帖子 #97 ---
m15 on first support(stoch at ema 20 shouldnt break to dwnside due to extremely bullish h1) but lets wait and see LOL while i was writing this nice dip took place protected profit on m1 ema 204 break i think this was only SL hunt m5 is on bearzone border could be rejection here so adding here is good idea but i will wait for m1 signal first but once again lets wait for valid signal and see what will happen

--- 帖子 #98 ---
bounce off m15 ema 55 cause m15 rejection FE 261.8% target confirmed by bounce off on 161.8% retest h1's momentum is extremely bullish noone can stop bulls now noone 170 on the cards now

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I have modified a TLs a little bit and guess who is back ? My old friend white rabbit

--- 帖子 #100 ---
triple rejection at bearzone border on m15 with that demand we can see 180 also this is insane .

--- 帖子 #101 ---
1st TP has been hit Took some profit at 16350 +850 pips I do not count scalp trades. Piece of cake these days. We are at daily ema 14 resistance also daily momentum ema 20 resistance. and bearzone border resistance. retrace is possible but i will wait for short signal. Moved SL below ema 14 on H1 for rest positions.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
m5 short signal rounded top + bounce off bullzone border to downside. m1 bulltrap mode move to upside without momentum TP 161

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Remember to take partial profit at 161.8% of correction move and put SL on BE.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
m1 rejection then u can short again on next retrace which should bring us to LTL of the channel (white) 261..8% of previous correction(red fibo) and 161.8% of current correction(yellow fibo) 80% reliability now TP 161 EDIT sorry posted wrong chart before m1 was supported at stoch's ema 20 watch cyan TL

--- 帖子 #105 ---
m5 look price is moving upward but momntum is declining IMO bearflag mode after breakout drop should be along green line bullish signal only when cyan TL will be breached

--- 帖子 #106 ---
happy to discover this thread of yours i've been using oanda with momentum 30 with ma's 3 21 55 imposed, RSI, and macd (30, 55, 90) This combo helped in achieving consistent good results Hope to benefit more from your thread

--- 帖子 #107 ---
im glad that u have found ur own working system I think there are plenty of them even undiscovered ones enjoy staying here back to subject m5 in bearzone now and gather bearish momentum m15 generated short signal - stoch crossed bullzone and ema 20 so short is lookin more reliable now for even lower targets such as 159 but once again watch out for m15 bearzone rejection last times was stopped triple times. 16110 is TP for partial profits now

--- 帖子 #108 ---
no breakout has been made yet could be false breakout because of bearish div on m15 and m5 ema 20 resistance shorted the rally

--- 帖子 #109 ---
now it was definetely short setup was scr#w up but easy and quick 100pips was on the table now m5 and m15 bullzone rejection possible also ema 14 on daily chart is at 16390. shorted this rally

--- 帖子 #110 ---
m5 and m15 bullzone rejection confluence nice 1 st TP is ema 55 on 15 min

--- 帖子 #111 ---
but this chart looks very nice for shorts closed all longs here 16410 (many pips ) now i got only short position.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Small retracement to ema 7(159) would have been healthy for further surge. We have first sign of reversal on daily (stoch already left bearzone and crossed ema 20. Momentum is rising constantly even on ema 20.)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
it can be a correction in present "long" trend as i read from macd 30 where the mas have not dipped below 000 in a 15m frame. will wait before i exit my longs den ps i'll try posting the chart

--- 帖子 #114 ---
waiting for ur chart and explanation about MACD because i have never discovered how to use it LOL

--- 帖子 #115 ---
TP has been hit took half profit at 16203 waiting to confirmation and will add to shorts 261.8% of prevoius correction was line up with ema 55 on m15. looking for short around 161.8% level

--- 帖子 #116 ---
m5 new correction and new targets m15 after bullzone rejection have been entered to bearzone already m30 is genarating short signal

--- 帖子 #117 ---
pl gimme time i'll try to post a chart explainin everything den

--- 帖子 #118 ---
bounce off LTL of this damned wedge(also ema 204 on m5) but m30 momnetum is declining. It suggest me lower targets. daily ema 14 is 16398 so im short biased untill daily ema 14 will be taken out see ya later

--- 帖子 #119 ---
last one chart before i leave We have perfect setup for 160 level - daily ema 14 and h1 ema 55 -161.8% FE of last rise mean correction move - LTL of the channel -m15 stoch bounce off ema 20 resistance -m30 bearish momentum and stoch divergence -H1 stoch's is passing ema 20 -H3 need a rest Just beautifull setup will be back later my SL is placed at 16450

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Honestly.. i still confuse.., how to get clear direction to start Entry BUY/SELL, could you make it simple please..? well I gues I have to read a lot.. babypips..

--- 帖子 #121 ---
hope they explain it a bit in the first image the mom30 above zero line corresponds exactly with the cross over of the MAs of MACD30 For me it is like this -----&gt; when the (yellow) sma3 crosses down brown wma21 it is a correction for me provided the mom 30 is above zero . If it goes down the zero line it is a short trend for me. After seeing you trade today I feel that Stoch RSI together with macd and mom30/40 can be great package for scalping against the trend which otherwise has bruised me in past badly Tryin to be of some use

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Couldnt be me more beautifull day great TP has been hit that is awesome Closed shorts from UTL to LTL just 500 pips today so far Long from H1 ema 55 15850 LTL of the channel major support for bulls stoch at bullzone border and momentum at ema 100 TP is ~170

--- 帖子 #123 ---
valid long signal on m5 and m15 m5 after two bearzone rejction stoch droped to bearzone area.Now just left causing m15 ema 20 cross. That is easy now momentum must find support at ema 20 on m5 H3 retracement to 161.8% and bounce off confirmed target 261.8% (yellow fibo) which is located near of major UTL of the downtrend and is 161.8% of current correction (blue fibo)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
clasic bullfag on m5 momentum found support at ema 20 but price is retracting easy money

--- 帖子 #125 ---
ppl took profits just like i did at 161.8% of last correction move m1 bearzone rejection next TP is 261.8% = 163.5-164

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Do u remember when i told u about H3 ema 14 very powerfull support/resistance ? So take a look closely Big demand at 3H ema 14 - longed wick candle and momentum rise indicate this. Short will be safe only when candle close below ema 14. With this momentum we can break red UTL of the downtrend and hit second TL (green) Daily momentum stucked a little at ema 20 but stoch left bearzone already. We have 4 bullish heikin-ashi candle since july !!!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
please read babypips after u will be known all about gann, fibonnaci, eliot wave, price action, candlestick patterns u can read my thread and will be all clear for u cheers and wish u alot of patience

--- 帖子 #128 ---
something is smell fishy to me m5 is about to drop but i do not follow better buy dips always remember to protect ur profits.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sorry if this question has previously been answered but I couldn't find any reference to it in the thread. I downloaded the template onto my MT4 platform: But my RSI-Stoch indicator is not matching yours in any time frame I try. Yours show an RSI of 65. The template is at 21. Changing it to 65 doesn't show the 25/75 channel as shown on your charts. On mine, either the 25 shows, or the 75, but never both no matter what time frame I change to.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Im in their high shool divergerence trading is their last stage peeped in at the door http://www.babypips.com/school/divergence_trading.html which live feed do you use?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
sorry i cant help u in this matter Im not using MT and im not a software engineer either. We need help of arezab he has created this template. My suggestion is maybe will better to use stochastich instead of RSI ?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Mentioned earlier 161.8% level hasnt been broken after second try thus price must retract to gather more speed and more buyers in lowers levels (such as me) waiting for long signal on m1 realese(breakout of bearzone) and possible m5 rejection

--- 帖子 #133 ---
m5 rejection possible TPs and channel bulls still in play

first attempt to breakout a flag has failed m5 bullzone rejection m5 in bearzone but without momentum thus could be second attempt to push higher

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Good morning better to follow instead to be biased m5 generated nice signal for 500 pips drop. new setup h3 bullish -momentum still above ema 20 h1 possible bearzone rejection otherwise bears come back to the market m30 bearish m15 bearish m5 is trying to reverse to upside with rising momentum I bought here because small risk TL will hod or not if not then im short good luck

--- 帖子 #136 ---
m5 is doing great momentum is rising almost verticaly stoch in bullzone m15 is genereting long signal m30 i trying to reverse h1 couldbe bounce off bearzone border. h3 remains bullish fibo calculated possible TPs are 169-170=161.8% if this level will be broken then 17750=261.8% of current correction (white fibo). If LTL wont hold then next bear target is 151 area took some profit and moved SL to BE If u wanna live long in this market always take partial profit. Good luck

--- 帖子 #137 ---
So far so good... LONG signal confirmed on H3 and H1 cyan line will be broken according to H3's momentum and H1's bear zone rejection lock ur profits and follow ema 14 on 15 min chart

--- 帖子 #138 ---
took partial profit at cyan line m15 possible bullzone rejection moved SL for all longs to 15850

--- 帖子 #139 ---
The templete posted in the begining has RSI instead of StochRSI. What are your settings for StochRSI?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
m15 bullzone entrance granted take a look at h3 momentum is making new high but price still below previous top 165.This mean we will see double top at least. but still cyan line must be taken out before show will begin Take a notice that momentum is highest since august !!!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Before i leave one last post went long at 15820 SL below 157 m5 bear zone rejection m15 stoch ema 20 support near bull zone m30 stoch ema 20 support above bearzone h1 possible bearzone rejection h3 you know already daily becomes more bullish Have a great weekend everybody.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
last one post this time m5 triple bear zone rejection with rising momentum let see if they wanna play this out.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
163 is ema 14 on daily chart so is right thing to do take partial profit here 3h ema 120 here also We must clear 163 to continue further surge. Protect ur profits m15 is about to drop because m5 is heading to bear zone therefore we might see retracement to ~160.5 level Follow the white rabbit (white dashed line) long near this line short below.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Very bullish though m5 bear zone rejection m15 stoch ema 20 support momentum is making new high might be only spike but preffer clear m5 signal

--- 帖子 #145 ---
h1 ema 14 usually provide good support so added here some longs TP is gettin closer

--- 帖子 #146 ---
if stochs are around 50% we have indecision state. so better switch to lower TF and see who got an advantage m5 is bearish m1 possible bear zone rejection

--- 帖子 #147 ---
it should be simple range upper band ema 120 lower band ema 14 h3 candle close above/below will cause breakout. according to h3 momentums long in favor but anything might happen.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi all Ive been away Back to bussiness. I concider the breakout is now confirmed (bounce off cyan line) daily bounce off suppport of ema 20 in momnetum. 3H is bullish H1 is also bullish m30 is very bullish thats enough for bulishness and 170 target for now later perhaps 180 we will see

--- 帖子 #149 ---
h1 stoch is near ema 20 support m30 stoch and mom is sitting at ema 20 support only m15 is turning to bearish and might spoil bulls party m5 ema 20 support in bear zone

--- 帖子 #150 ---
cable is also important and similar to geppy daily has been supported by momentum and stoch ema 20 for the first time since avalanche has started. . Soon will be breakout 1.750 should be TP

--- 帖子 #151 ---
m15 bear zone rejection confirmed on m5 by stoch's breakout from bear zone and bullish div on momentum so we have a bullish setup then

--- 帖子 #152 ---
m15 and m5 short signal no long until next "buy" signal preferably at 156

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Triangle 157-160.5 H3 remains bullish stoch in bullzone but momentum is getting weaker H1 bullsh divergences thats good for upside breakout no chart because internet connection issue

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I'm enyojing your every post. Realy good system,the last I was interested in was Akuma's BB squeeze. I never gave much time on research of Momentum,though without it there is no trend... I realy have learn alot from this system in so short time. but I would ask you a favor. In tpl for MT4 we have RSI instead of StochRSI. So I found two on other forums, but they have so much different setting that can't figure out wich number to change. So I was wondering, would you be so kind and look at them and tell as maybe, if you can, wich to use and what set to use? I, and I believe many others too will appreciate your efford. THANKS and keep good work.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
My mind works too fast, so I forget to do things. If you have Oanda , can not open this indicators.So I give two pics for two Indicators. Have any idea?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Moreover i dont use Windows so i cant try it on MT platform. This indicator on the right does look similar. Use period 65 and show me hourly and daily TF . Thanks

--- 帖子 #157 ---
triangle broken h3 momentum and stoch are changing to bearish =SELL signal earlier h1 sell signal on bull zone rejection around 160 Downtrend still very strong

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I'm glad by getting close to solution... I entered 20EMA(aqua blue) in there as you have. PS: This is RSI=65, but look the other with Percent_K=65,H1 chart

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Percent_K=65,H1 and Percent_D=65. Other numbers stay the same as seen on pic from post 155. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Please look at my daily stochRSI and try to set those indicators to look similar like mine. I noticed that ur inidcators point stoch around 100% level while mine are only a little above 30%.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Daily is changing to bearish again(momnetum crossed back ema 20 to downside) H3 generated sell signal but we have to be patient to see how cycle will end. H1 is very bearish (stochs are unable to cross ema 20 ) m30 and m15 look similar like H1 So we have a tank time definately. possible support around 150-149 area next double bottom 139-135 then i have no idea

--- 帖子 #162 ---
easiest way to earn money follow the crowd and play with trend direction just wait for m1 signal because m5 is neutral and m 15 is bullish ok we got m1 sell signal near UTL of the channel so short should be safe with 100 pips SL just in case.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
HI, me again Whatever number I change is useless. would you put up your numbers? Be very gratefull... Thank you.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
i could expect that m15 is still bullish better wait for m5 bear zone mode to take safe short position

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I found a solution that looks similar to yours...RSI65 with Stochastic Oscill. look at chart 1H:

--- 帖子 #166 ---
great news please post these indicators and template thanks

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Would you please put out your numbers of StochRSI? Maybe is secret in %D and %K and other... Thanks.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
storsi variable settings 5ysfx, what settings of your stochrsi (please, look inside at properties)? (simular to how Tim94 did in post 155 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=155 thank you

--- 帖子 #169 ---
im trying my strategy on MT4 now. Could u post a template(or below indicator only) here of last chart u made ? Thank u

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Thank u for this indicator Below is fully ported system from Oanda to MT4 Thank u all arezab,tim94, fxxx and others interested for ur efforts. let see how this works(or not) on bigger TF such as weekly and monthly

--- 帖子 #171 ---
And this how should this looks like. This setup is a little different than oanda's one(maybe even better and more accurate) It will be tested on demo. Could anyone provide indicator with smaller TF than 1 minute for MT4 ? TIA

--- 帖子 #172 ---
wow ...- looks good! (something plesant to look at!) now we talking... Thank you, 5 !

--- 帖子 #173 ---
seems like debut was good now we have m15 signal

--- 帖子 #174 ---
ema20 resistance in stoch so short in play between bands of the white channel

--- 帖子 #175 ---
m1 bear zone rejection with rising momentum should cause m5 stoch breakout worth to try go long here

--- 帖子 #176 ---
reason of short positions m1 is losing steam m5 possible rejection retracement and TL

--- 帖子 #177 ---
short the hell m15 looks better now (second confirmation by stochs and false breakout)

--- 帖子 #178 ---
thanks 5ysfx for the kind effort of making things understandable and to hear our requests out. Be glad to follow your road to success. Thanks

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Looks like a good system! May I ask if you ae trading this life and how long have you been trading? Will keep an eye on this system

--- 帖子 #180 ---
5ysfx tell me what is the story of the third indicatorb on chart? I added as second attachment beside .tpl. So at first eye, it seems that green and red colors should be reversed. Tell us some more.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
HI FRIEND... i really like ur post on here.... i guess i am a great loser here...i have been trading forex ful time and i havent made any profit...i just resigned from my work which tend to be hell stressful.and i have been depositing into my forex account but always loosing...i have read alot of ebooks bought alot of custom strategy..and all that, i read trends..but late they wont go samething same day...could u please help me with a strategy or indicators that works well at least 60%, so that i can also be making profit and not lose....i am about to go broke.... pls feel free to email me at GAILBROS@AOL.COM GOD BLESS U!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
i dont know how to use it in "regular form" i had to setup properly to fit my demand

--- 帖子 #183 ---
m15 is very bearish h1 stochs and moms are sitting on ema20 support h4 nice heikn-ashi red candle TP open but will cover shorts in 100 pips step.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I wonder what's the difference when StochRSI bounce from 20EMA and goes down bearish or between when it bounce and then again it crosses the 20EMA and goes bullish or vice-versa. Does all depend on where Mom is? Or is catch in Trend/ trend reversed? Wich timeframe sets a trigger for you? Is in 15m? are you always watching from 1m till 1daily? Thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Where will it go: to R1, Fibo161.8 =155,75 or to S1, Fibo261,8 =150,32 ??? This is the question...

--- 帖子 #186 ---
im trying here SL is 14980 m30 momentum divergence h1 possible bear zone rejection m1 momentum div was a trigger(but i should wait for m5 divergence) i like to catch bottom so do not follow me

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Bottoms are complex maybe 423.6% will be good support for a while ?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
did works once again m5 and m30 momentum ema20 support

--- 帖子 #189 ---
did works as hell inverted H&amp;S on m1 m5 turn to bullish m15 is turning to bullish slowly m30 mom's ema20 support h1 double bottom fals breakout h4 LTL of the channel false breakout but moms and stochs remain little bearish. SL on BE and let see how far we can go

--- 帖子 #190 ---
That one earlier was full of pips. Do you must always watch untill the last sec. or you see some other signs yet before? Like the last bearish. I didn't see it comming till last minute, for me it could headed bullish. Do you see it in Mom's strenght? EMA's supports are real strong factors? sometimes is bear zone rejections and goes bearish then, there's time when goes bullish.?!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I went rereading your thread and found some answers. It's not an easy system and slooowly getting used to those signals. I appreciate your efford putting some sence into charts.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I will remember today 12.11.2008 for the rest of my life...probably. Today I, with your help 5ysfx, earned 700 pips( from several pairs). THANK YOU Without your system I would earn something and then lost it again. Who is patienced will be rewarded. I still can not believe. Hope to keep my sences and to not get gridy. But there is so much to be learned, so 5ysfx put some wisdom in our heads. Thanks, can't wait to read your post...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
5ysfx, Hope you didn't leave forever...I miss your posts I wonder,to anyone out there, is there a custom indicator for Gann grid? I was googling it around and seems that there is none.Has anyone try to construct it? How can one do it in MT4? Some suggestions and links on that matter would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
In MT4 click insert and you will see gann tools

--- 帖子 #195 ---
you may find it funny but i started making some good trades when i changed my attitude from being dependent on successful trade to not being so. To make it happen i took up a day job and started trades with very small lots which never scared me even when they went against me by 2000 it made me overcome my fears. Earlier i messed 90% of trades due to fear of losing

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hello friends Im back online. Forgive me my absence here I had got internet connection issue with my provider.Now should be OK. Back to the bussiness looks like daily reversal

--- 帖子 #197 ---
this is very good system and once you get the feel of the things then perhaps you see the light at the end of the tunnel

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Welcome back 5ysfx ... Have a Q: When rejection of StochRSI at borders(bull or bear) comes, what decides where it would go - or will it rejects again or will it go through. Is it Momentum, pozitive or negative? Is it degree of Mom's slope that shows it? I noticed you use more than one TF to decide the move, depends on situation 2nd Q: What TF to choose if there's one(5m) heading bearish and the other(15m) bullish. Do you watch the next bigger TF? Thanks For your effort

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Speaking for myself, for scalps m30 is deciding the state of the present trend with the help of where stoch is and mom's angle. then i go to m5 or even smaller and try entering at the bottom or top for the best entry. perhaps 5ys will come back and tell whenever he gets time

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Bigger TFs such 1H and up decide who rule the market bulls or bears so all TFs are important the same way. m15 gives reliable signal of changing the intraday trend(it could last form 2h to 8h ever or this smal trend could extend to bigger move even) m5 and m1 im using only for accuracy to pick bottoms/tops or quick scalp for 50 pips. When rejections occur i lookin for support/resistance zone in emas/fibo/TLs and yes rising momentum means rejection is very possible there but this is not working all the time so we have to use SL everytime for our safety. I hope this helps i will show a few examples later.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
m15 has been defending bear zone so far ema 50 hourly is good support if broken then short in play there is a lot of room below

--- 帖子 #202 ---
What would your coment be on this rejection GBP/JPY 15m chart. would you wait to StoshRSI gets resistance( rejects) in EMA20 and goes down couse Mom is so small, or will trend reverse and go up! Tell me then for example what's the emportance of this move; why will turn or not...

--- 帖子 #203 ---
2 failed attempt to bring price into bear zone in very short time. This could indicates strong support in there. Also very important are majors pairs cable and gopher. Have a look at these charts cable strong m15 bear zone rejection. gopher m15;s momentum divergence and h1 bear zone rejection(first attempt)

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Certainly I have to look at things more objective, and that example came out very handy... thanks

--- 帖子 #205 ---
HI, it's me and my Q... again... Why didn't this two bounces rejected the trend. Is it becouse of supperted Mom in 20 and 100EMA later on? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
i think so also price was unable to breach upward ema 14

--- 帖子 #207 ---
New week new competition. short on wedge breakout or target only

--- 帖子 #208 ---
or maybe now is quite good time for another test of LTL of the wedge m30 is generating sell signal so there is a good chance to break the wedge to downside when Londons open. If so then we will see h1 bull zone rejection therefore should be more range action.Im just scalping both ways. Let see.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
now is looking good for short side m15 bull zone rejection m5 sell signal 140 or much lower

--- 帖子 #210 ---
LTL of the wedge long is good bet especially when h1 momentum is rising and stoch is entering to bull zone also equities are doing good so far.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Partial TP time major emas here daily and weekly look pretty wild ;-]

--- 帖子 #212 ---
short is worth a risk here m5's momentum is breaking ema20

--- 帖子 #213 ---
plan for coming days according to my system short at ema34 daily to test ema14 as support if holds then i will buy more still holding long positions as carry trade looks promising

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Started later, as an unsure newbie should, but came out strong 300pips long... As for StochRSI system considering its a hell of a system. And all the thanks goes to 5ysfx.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I think this is a good thread. I already read it many times, but still confuse. Plz help me (and maybe the others too) to explain step by step how to take decision. thx for your help!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
After NY close bell we should see small retracement at least it would be nice to see that

--- 帖子 #217 ---
38.2% - time to build long positions again m5 divergence started

--- 帖子 #218 ---
h1 stochastic on support this is first touch of 75% border near ema20 and this mean very strong support and safe bet even in bearish market overall condition

--- 帖子 #219 ---
h4's ema14 provide support thats good news for higher targets such daily ema34 or ema50 I am buying dips channel still intact let see

--- 帖子 #220 ---
BTW: Does someone know how to make Gann Grid on MT4( more than just the basic net) and can explain all the variables( time:from-to, Value and Scale), couse all I can get is this: pic_01. Can someone build up some kind of makro for MT4, that can draw lines at certain angles. Would be very appreciated.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
h4 ema100 and double top good place to go short small one of course

--- 帖子 #222 ---
m1 possible rejection which lines up with m5's ema14 long again

--- 帖子 #223 ---
buy the dips buy the dips buy the dips

--- 帖子 #224 ---
50 pips short sclp SL above double top formation m1 and m5 is turning to bearish

--- 帖子 #225 ---
buy the dips laalalallla possible m1 rejection

--- 帖子 #226 ---
interesting situation m15 and m5 possible rejection let see

--- 帖子 #227 ---
interesting interesting todays Asian session should kick off this things up to the sky but all depend on Wallstreet move. S&amp;P500 looks like bullflag is forming let see

--- 帖子 #228 ---
another amazing thing conclusion asian ppl bought on very good price so shoud push this train fast forward BTW S&amp;P500 broke the flag upward and create lower shadow on daily candle. orient express is leaving the station ;-]

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Cant help u with macro thing but u can draw manually my Gann grid modification called Kmap. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=172 Kmap in action atm. aud/usd and aud/jpy if price wont breach 60 level we should see strong buying in coming days

--- 帖子 #230 ---
food for thought buying stage should be complete now. this will be h1 rejection 151 target is quite possible this week even. below 145 setup failed and bears strike back BTW I switched back to Oanda charts work better for me.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
h3 is bullish combined with h1 bear zone rejection should cause break of ema 100 and move price higher to test ema 200 Good luck

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Oanda and MT4 differences with stochRSI setup I cant make similar one graph. As u can see oanda's chart show h1 bear zone rejecion while MT4 show little breach of bull zone level.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Have u ever seen such thing before ? H&amp;S inside bigger H&amp;S below is yen index H2 and H4 charts

--- 帖子 #234 ---
m5 ema14 became a resistance short scalp

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Tell me sth.. Do you need a live account open in Oanda to 'play' with Oanda platform? I have some amount but I don't see why I would have to open new account. Now I have MT4 with demo account. Is this possible in Oanda? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I saw that yours thread before, that's why I ask you. And I tried... You can't say I didn't try... But I guess the lines don't stay, where I put them, any more... It's dificult to get the basic Gann grid to work propertly ... It's all right! You can't have always what you want...

--- 帖子 #237 ---
looks like bulls are losing steam near h4's ema120 covered longs and building short now h1 is turning to bearish h4 momentum droping m15 bull zone rejection

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Well no party(mean breakout) without US guys m15 yet another bullzone rejection false upward breakout should bring price to lower targets descending channel in play m15's ema250 first target(and maybe last)

--- 帖子 #239 ---
covered shorts m15 bear zone rejection and m30 stoch's ema20 support h1 bear zone rejection still in play LTL of major channel intact

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Zed is dead baby. Zed is dead but i will try buy here m5 possible bear zone rejection (very probable because momentum bounce off ema 20) m15 yet another bear zone rejection. Ping pong mode apparently...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
5ysfx, please would you tell me what are the numbers for StochRSI in Oanda , that I can have the same settings as in thread are. Found Oanda game account and will try on this one, For better perspective... Attached Image I saw Pics, when you compare them, and think is crucial to use Oanda on this system...At least until StochRSI in MT4 isn't improved by smone.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi stoch rsi settings are 65,70,30 check out 30 sec chart my favourit BTW LTL of the channel is trying to be crack. Watch this carefully

--- 帖子 #243 ---
seems like bounce off LTL m5 rejection and perhaps strong h1 rejection again good spot for buy (low risk)

--- 帖子 #244 ---
next 6 hours will be crucial price is ranging between ema120 and ema34 Pattern is bullish flag but we have to remeber we are in strong bearish trend.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
doesnt look familiar breakout will be huge (up or down) = easy money

--- 帖子 #246 ---
breakout or not ? i am buying dips and waiting for LTL retest.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
maybe eur/jpy give us a clue h3 stoch are waiting for acces to bull zone right before border. momentum is bullish below ema52 price shoud drop to 118 area if bounce off then we bounce off All we need is strong stox buying when EU session start

--- 帖子 #248 ---
cable looks strong bulls have been defending border succesfull so far but momentum dropped below ema100. gopher is trying to reverse stoch have been respecting ema20 so far To further upside target in geppy gopher must clear 96 cable must clear 1550 yen must be sold off hard today is last trading day of the month.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
our odds rising take a look at momentum on h3

--- 帖子 #250 ---
i think i found the reason... white channel inside green pitchfork

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Tim94, sorry if i missed it, but what's wrong with StoRSI(mt4)?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
if someone is interested swissy looks very nice sell sell sell

--- 帖子 #253 ---
bigger outlook for swissy first TP white dashed line so called white rabbit if broken then LTL of the wedge. 122 target has been predicted by mine http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...hf#post2192878 Enjoy

--- 帖子 #254 ---
EUR/AUD big sell off is coming(rather AUD huge demand) sell signal generated on daily study + weekly bull zone rejection this upmove was also predicted but i thought it could last in "long term period" was wrong very wrong http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...ud#post2203744

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Watch out for m15 and m30 bull zone rejection a few longs covered

--- 帖子 #256 ---
looks like m15 bull zone rejection entered short scalp

--- 帖子 #257 ---
so looks like real breakout now short in play for now let see what London boys gonna to do with that.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Very well then back to primary objectives buying dips m15 bear zone rejection + ema20 support

--- 帖子 #259 ---
bull flag breakout retest

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Please, where can I download Momentum with EMA and StochRSI with EMA ?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Do not start to read this thread from end only start from begining please and all anwers will be known

--- 帖子 #262 ---
m15 bear zone rejection but price must close above ema52 for higher targets no short yet but sell signal is getting closer

--- 帖子 #263 ---
m1 bear zone rejection so maybe now bulls will take some sweet action

--- 帖子 #264 ---
tricky friday i am buying dips still no short for me ema52 support

--- 帖子 #265 ---
5, you started early today... or better late nigt yesterday. Don't need sleep or just can afford to, when you expect fx moves. Again alot of usefull data... must comprehend slowly. FXXX: Not wrong, just a little bit out of scale...sometimes..

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yep when i start trading forex for a living a lose my "timeframe" completely sometimes i wake in middle at night on asian session and sometimes goes to sleep in noon to wake up on London session fixing. crazy life but when u start with few hundred bucks then u have to use all moves to create "usefull" deposit for future action BTW swissy short in play as long double top holds TP is 1.15 area

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Swissy h4 this downmove looks like impulsive wave because momentum dropped sharply below ema100.Thats why i im short biased now and selling all the way up. H4 candle was unable to close above 61.8% fibo level. Momentum is trying to close to ema100 again but dollar will be sold near ema100. If this happen then we have established new downtrend channel daily 1st target is 161.8% fibo.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Sorry, but i cant instal your indi

--- 帖子 #269 ---
now is looking good geppy ema34 + ema52 strong support was buying because of emas and bullish wedge pattern with stochs in bull zone. swissy all these bunch of shorts because momnetum have been droping this was so called "divergence move"(in Elliot Wave theory will be called wave 5th) or rally which scream to me "short me,short me"

--- 帖子 #270 ---
swissy channels this is what im talking about at least one month of dollar sell off

--- 帖子 #271 ---
covered a few longs all in profit i left best shots only we are approaching to ema120 on H4

--- 帖子 #272 ---
swissy short in play no doubt geppy small shorts scalp from ema120 next week possibly breakout to higher targets such ema 34/50 daily have a nice weekend everyone

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hmm almost missed it Hourly momentum dropped below ema100 = this is not good for upside move. Daily momentum ema100 reistance. We should see last wave down If momentum's ema20 becomes a support then we have a true reversal if not then downtrend will continue. Downside targets are rounded triple bottom around 1.40 if broken then LTL of the wedge around 127. Cable looks similar All because lack of GBP demand.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
StochasticRSI_TS5ysfx.mq4 - StochasticRSI_ (Mladen) modified for 5ysfx Momentum and StochRSI system; functions, used in TS

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Do u remember what i said about geppy upside targets ? ema 34/ema50 daily then retract to ema14 to test as support ? We are observing such pattern on fiber chart.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Daily momentum crossed ema100 already. If ema20 will provide support then price retract to 1.35 area Weekly is very bearish if 1.35 will be hit weekly stochRSI will be near ema20 and bear zone border probably. If will lose daily momentum there this mean short big time again. As long as price stays above 1.25 is long for 1000 pips target. Below 1.25 target for short is also 1000 pips.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
oil daily more or less looks like three inside up pattern http://www.candlesticker.com/Cs61.asp friday long shadow and close above ema7 might suggest quite good demand for ema34/50 target also momentum is passing ema20.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
HI, nice to see you preparing for the new week, so are we with you. Looks like we are going to have volatility week to come. Is that unfinished legacy from friday? I really wonder wich way it's gonna go... Anyway it's our way! BTW: How do you like my new avatar? It's all me! Ha, ha, ha...

Indeed. Does no matter which way gonna breakout but i like to predict future Small update from open market Well MT4 show completely different setup than oanda on hourly chart. geppy still well supported will close longs only when stoch drop below ema20 or momentum will drop sharply or hourly candle will close significally below ema52.Still ranging between ema120 and ema52 on h3 chart. m30 support at ema20 on stoch atm. Breakout might be along orange TL.(climbing angle) Yen index bearish engulfing pattern with mentioned earlier potential double shampoo formation. Avatar ? I dont know what to say im shocked

--- 帖子 #281 ---
swissy is in sell off phase m15 in bear zone without resistance.This setup will cause h1 bull zone breakout to the downside then h3 breakout. m30 have been left bull zone already.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
When swissy is setup to short then fiber must go north. and there is really good chance for that according this system and Kmap Possible h3 bear zone rejection with rising momentum should kick off this thing to higher targets following the oil. According to Kmap if current bottom will be broken then 1.24 is next support.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
m15 stoch near ema20 and border clear sell signal (teoritically )

--- 帖子 #284 ---
closed one of long from 146 area adding to short m15 lost momentum near border suggest bull zone rejection m5 ema20 resistance near bear zone.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
locked profits SL for longs at 14530 watching h1 ema100 on h4 we have a no demand candle fallowed by sell off candle

--- 帖子 #286 ---
closing another short position m15 and m30 possible bear zone rejections.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
looks like bottom bullish div on 30 sec chart bought again small position

--- 帖子 #288 ---
i can try why not bullish div in momentum near ema100 hourly and still possible m15 bear zone rejection. conclusion worth to try

--- 帖子 #289 ---
We could say that target has been hit 261.8% of previous correction move. This is ema100 support after hourly death cross(ema 100 crossed ema200 on hourly chart) has been made. Also this is a figure and ema54 on h4 major support of this bullish wedge. let see

--- 帖子 #290 ---
swissy i leaving h1 bull zone everything according to the master plan so far

--- 帖子 #291 ---
maybe this channel should look like this ? any suggestion charts ideas ? dont be shy

--- 帖子 #292 ---
looks like BUY now daily momentum is rising near 61.8% fibo level

--- 帖子 #293 ---
fiber bullish div with rising momentum on m15 ema20 crossed ema100 and works as support swissy price has been unable to close above ema14/34 and momentum is rising fast for bear camp ok nap time for me see ya in a few hours

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Morning/afternoon/evening Cable current view looks like begining of new uptrend valid until LTL holds

--- 帖子 #295 ---
yet another sell off candle very nice time to get some speed finally

--- 帖子 #296 ---
last support for geppy and cable bull zone border if will be broken then short in play. also 423.6% target has been hit but m15 and h1 is bearish now let see

--- 帖子 #297 ---
closed all long geppy positions covered a few short swissy positions geppy added to short on ema52 break

--- 帖子 #298 ---
short all retracement until m15 momentum divergence

--- 帖子 #299 ---
added to short at m5 ema14 but possible retracement to m15 ema14

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Ojla! Must say nice move, althought I missed it a quarter. I'm not yet fully committed to forex due to other existencial things like day job. If it's gonna go that way most of times I'll reconsider that possibility also. Don't need to feed kids yet, so I can play oround a bit... What's your thought on Fundamentals. There must be sth on that matter or just another ilussion?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
covered one short on ema52 hourly last one short open as a long term trade set and forget i have to focus on geppy only

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Well have no idea about economy

--- 帖子 #303 ---
like i said earlier if triple bottom(inverted h&amp;s setup) will be broken then target for this sell off is around LTL of the descending wedge near 128/127 area also this will be 161.8% fibo of last correction move h1 is very bearish now h4 has turned to bearish but momentum still above ema100

--- 帖子 #304 ---
covered some shorts small long now m5 divergence

--- 帖子 #305 ---
closed and reverse

--- 帖子 #306 ---
seems like bullish divergence still in play

--- 帖子 #307 ---
OK US stox should push price lower sold on possible m5 bull zone rejection

--- 帖子 #308 ---
retracement maybe m1 divergence + m1 and m5 possible bear zone rejection covered previous short and reverse

--- 帖子 #309 ---
triple bottom ?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
u know me m5 bullish divergence in momentum near h4 bear zone border. hmmm maybe maybe

--- 帖子 #311 ---
big drop without momentum i call it bullsh*t geppy double bottom pattern (according to bullish divergence on momentum quite reliable) cable near LTL if will bounce off then target is UTL of the wedge. one short position left just in the case scalping mode no more update today. see ya later

--- 帖子 #312 ---
GM/A/E We have a bounce off let see how far we can go. covered a few longs on h1 ema14 (this is first touch) hard time ahead us bear zone border and ema20 on h1 but we have a first rejection on h4 that is good sign

--- 帖子 #313 ---
UTL of the channel on m15 and possible bull zone rejection ema180 on m5 and momentum is droping covered a few longs and took small short scalps

--- 帖子 #314 ---
correction ? daily bullish divergence in momentum + stoch sittin near bull zone border waiting for impulse to get in or to reject. Anyway low risk trade as long as green TL holds.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
after second TP has been hit (261.8%) we should drop to 423.6% and test once again LTL as u can see m5 momentum is droping very fast now causing m15 bull zone rejection so we might make new LL soon. let see what Albion boys gonna do with that. EDIT m30 is turning to bullish =stoch and mom ema20 became a support.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
higher and quicker she goes lower and longer she falls thats the nature of retracements target for this sell off is around LTL which is 61.8% fibo retracemnt of previous up thrust wave. momentum still rising for bear camp so LTL might be broken when London session start.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
covered a few shorts here looks like double bottom pattern because rising mom on m30 and LTL support on cable chart also mom ema20 on daily study

--- 帖子 #318 ---
also last support for gopher here below is stairway to... hell

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Well if double bottom willl holds then first TP is 141.20 next 143 if wont then next target is 137 area. still too early to choose destiny

--- 帖子 #320 ---
How about oil ? Today there is a chance for morning star pattern. h4 very possible bear zone rejection because of momentum divergence small daily bullish div also this bottom looks like U-turn.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
m5 and m15 bull zone rejection near breakout retest closed longs and reverse one more bottom test or new LL let see

--- 帖子 #322 ---
two digits or reversal good r/r ratio covered a few shorts and start building long position

--- 帖子 #323 ---
m1 stoch ranging between borders m5 waiting for impulse to enter into bull zone. m15 still weak m30 also

--- 帖子 #324 ---
now is looking very good m15 in bull zone h1 stoch is crossing ema20 and leaving bear zone first TP near ema34 hourly

--- 帖子 #325 ---
watch LTL nice bullish breakout pattern

--- 帖子 #326 ---
im starting here 38.2% fibo level. stoch ema20 support one of shorts covered as u can see making 1000 pips daily is piece of cake lately

--- 帖子 #327 ---
14350 area would be nice we have established an acceleration channel momentum on m15 is still rising

--- 帖子 #328 ---
aint so bad at least they are stop selling...

--- 帖子 #329 ---
i hope u took shorts on channel break (on m15 stoch left bull zone) easy money i was missed my opportunity m30 stoch at ema20 support closed one of short position maybe this channel would be played out

--- 帖子 #330 ---
so far so good m15 and m30 is entering bull zone h1 stoch supportedd twice at ema20 so this time should leave bear zone h4 looks like bear zone rejection(too early to say that for sure but i always trade probibilities not certaintities) 1st TP should be near ema 52 hourly

--- 帖子 #331 ---
if LTL will holds (according to hourly momentum there is a good chance) then price should bounce off at least to 14250 area as initial target for further surge.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Are u feeling brave ? so short usd/pln for 5000 pips profit

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi 5ysfx, I read everything on your thread and I'm not sure to understand perfectly what is an entry signal for you... I' ve been trading forex for 4 years so I'm not really a beginner and have one idea of the big picture.....but not really of all the details you are considering.... Woud you be so kind to provide us a document which gives us all the principles of your strategy, as I'm very impressed by your results and believe you don't mind to share with us Congratulations for your thread, and thanks in advance for your participation in helping us becoming a better trader

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Sorry was busy lately Well depend what signal do u need. Rules are very simple 1)I recommend m5 for scalp trade (50-120 usually but i might be 500-1000 pips even when scalp will turn to regular trend mean rising momnetum and m15 stochRSI in bull/bear zone then m30 and so on ) 2)m15 for m5's signal continuation only. 3)H1 and H3/H4 is best way to play with trend direction.(sell the rallies,buy the dips near ema14/34/52) 4)For trend reversal use only daily signal.(momentum ema20 change to resistance from support then crossing ema100. Price is near double top formation or similar and stoch left bull/bear zone preferably bouncing off ema20) For targets i use emas and fibo 161.8%/261.8% extension depend on TF. Ema14 is most important for me.Especially on daily and h3 chart. m1 signal might also turn to over 1000 pips trade but u need luck and patience. (bottom/top picking) If something is is not understable please ask specific question with example on chart thanks.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Well does it mean you only scalp in direction of daily trend ??? Thanks

--- 帖子 #336 ---
USD reversal is closer then i thought might be. Today's candle will be very bearish because i do not expect strong buying into close of the day. Tommorow should be bearish too so bearish engulfing on weekly expected. I got also reversal signal on daily chart for USD/PLN.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
sometimes yes depend on stochRSI location on m15 to h3/h4 TF's

--- 帖子 #338 ---
check this out we had long signal(momentum crosed ema100 and stochRSI in bull zone) but this is pointless in such strong m15 trend. m15 in bear zone almost flat this mean no bulls activity.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
You'll short again this market cause m15 is in bear zone ??? and m1 in bull zone does'nt mean anything.....

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Correct. Have to wait for m5 momentum divergence to think about going long. m5 still in bear zone. Also usually after such strong selloff price is retracting only to ema14(blue) on m5 and dive again then could bounce to ema34/50 and dive again and so on Let see.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
m1 in bear zone again h4 in bear zone this mean we have a downtrend as long as price stays below ema14.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
you're right once more ema14 on which TF ??? Personnaly I use a complimentary StochRSI (14,3,3) which tells me on M15 when is a reversal with your StochRsi crossing above bearzone and of course mom same direction I joined an example where green triangles are signals....

--- 帖子 #343 ---
interesting mod i can say ema14 on h3/h4 today we broke ema14 on daily and mom's ema20 starting act like resistance so bigger retracement expected or true reversal time will tell. good night need some sleep.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Momentum on h1 bounce from ema20 suggesting downtrend continuation Possible targets are line up with ema180(161.8%) and ema250(261.8%) on h4 chart. let see if momentum can predict price movement.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi 5, I see mom up on H1, so my optimal short will be 1,2050 agree ????

--- 帖子 #346 ---
graph here

--- 帖子 #347 ---
im not so sure if she reach that level must clear 38.2% level on 12029 is ema14 on h4 also and another thing is fiber which brke the bull flag already with rising mom and support at ema14 hourly. time will tell. Good luck

--- 帖子 #348 ---
on H4 my special StoRSI tells we are in a current up move so what is the trend ??????

--- 帖子 #349 ---
IMO based on candlestick pattern we just started new downtrend. as long as price stays below ema14 on H4 we shall see new lower targets.(now is testing resistance ema14 on daily) H4 stoch in bear zone so i wont risk going long anymore.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
+1

--- 帖子 #351 ---
What's your analysis on EurUsd ??? Thanks

--- 帖子 #352 ---
should be similar to swissy so bigger retracement expected but seems german factory orders screw up the whole plan.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Good morning i had get rid off MT4. It has been generating too many wrong signals. Swissy still looks like short setup has been established. Geppy nice bounce off LTL of the wedge looking for UTL or at least ema34/52 daily

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Good morning 5, i'll stay with my broker and MT4.... so let's see if we need adjustments for those using MQ4....

--- 帖子 #355 ---
offer still up to date is looking better than swissy if momentum will drop below ema100 then sell off is confirmed (i think )

--- 帖子 #356 ---
By the way who's your broker ????

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Sorry I can't trade UsdPln, not available with my broker......

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I trade with Oanda they have many exotic currencies but maybe u have usd/huf or usd/nok at least similar setup

--- 帖子 #359 ---
aussie made a reversal (theoretically- ema100 passed by momentum stoch in bull zone)

--- 帖子 #360 ---
buy dips for 12350 target short if price will drop below 119 also watch for bull zone rejection

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Don' you think all these set ups on different pairs just means Usd is falling again despite big plans announcements..

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi, just a post to thank you for sharing your method and your analysis

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Thank u. No probs Only one thing im not an oracle and this system also so always remember to take partial profit and keep tight SL and u will be reach for sure . In FX market there are many variable data and this data is changing pretty fast. Be flexible like Bruce Lee said "Be like water my friend" Good luck

--- 帖子 #364 ---
One more resistance to overcome then path to the south will be open. Below 12080 next TP is 1.20 psychological level if broken then 1.15 SL or long only above 1.2150 (ema14)

--- 帖子 #365 ---
There is rumor has it UK will join to ECB team Rally to parity ? Interesting... globalization globalization...

--- 帖子 #366 ---
long geppy near ema34/52 SL or short below 137 target is 141 again or higher

--- 帖子 #367 ---
It looks like a rising wedge ?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
now should be proper time m5 momentum divergence h1 ema52

--- 帖子 #369 ---
How do you see the momentum divergence ?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
first chart it has been shown many times in my previous posts but i show u again why not Second chart shows controlled retracement on m15 chart check this out how simple is that, 141 then drop to ema34 retract to ema14 and drop to ema52 retract to ema14 and drop to ema120 retract to ema14 and drop to ema204 price must break ema14/52 then our longs should be safe Thing that worried me is m15 stochs are in bear zone and still flat

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thanks for theses explanations And yes M15 still flat ...and i noticed that we are at the end of a triangle...

--- 帖子 #372 ---
yep triangle looks like ping pong mode this week until breakout i bet upside because of momentum long at ema14 reverse at ema52(if u will see bearish setup on lower TFs of course otherwise stay with long position)

--- 帖子 #373 ---
also.. i wonder if we will be able to reach ema204 this time... so far ema120 was unbeaten wall mean perfect short position entries

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Sorry for late reply some how i have missed ur post Yes im have been waiting for dollar weakness since two weeks. Patience will be rewarded soon

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hungarian Forint is gather some speed now and there is a big chance to break LTL as well according to my system m15 m30 h1 h3 and daily stochs are in bear zone mean very bearish Note : This is high yield currency so yen crosses should follow soon

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Last one chart today. If price will stays above ema14 then next targets are 1st TP = double top 2nd TP = 142 = 161.8% FE = ema120 3rd TP = 145 = 261.8% FE = ema204(maybe maybe ) and very unlikely this week 14950 = 423.6% FE = ema34 daily Good night

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Thanks for this last chart Good night

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Good morning/afternoon/evening Asian session retrace US session move as usual. eur/jpy still holding on 119 this is good spot for buy with SL(short) below gbp/jpy still ping pong mode as i mentioned earlier long above 137 short below. Thats all for now lets wait for London/Frankfurt moves.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
ZEW economic sentiment today so we should see major move in fiber Swissy still looks like uptrend will continue (momentum cant drop below ema100) but i hope data will bring some fresh breakout. fiber is in much better shape. on daily price is respecting ema14 so uptrend is coming as long as price stays above ema14. Interesting days... Plan Short swissy at 1.21with SL-long above 12150 or buy fiber near h3's ema14 with SL-short below 1.28

--- 帖子 #380 ---
closer look for swissy with marked resistance area. m15 still bullish though

--- 帖子 #381 ---
mixed feeelings there h3 on support h1 looks bearish m15 is trying to recover from bear zone closed all geppy trade atm I stay with swissy short today

--- 帖子 #382 ---
bought eur/jpy instead entry 119 with SL = 100 pips h3 candle close above 119 (119.04 exactly) m15 is leaving bear zone euroland stox doing good so far. targeting h3 ema204 or yellow dashed line whatever comes first

--- 帖子 #383 ---
short swissy at 12150 SL 30 pips m15 bearish divergence and UTL m5 possible bear zone rejection

--- 帖子 #384 ---
they are really pissing me off today stopped all on BE waiting for another opportunity no bias atm

--- 帖子 #385 ---
ok i found nice setup on eur/aud m15 momenum below ema100 and stoch beyond bull zone also stoch ema20 provide reistance so far. took short at 1.9605 SL 65 pips this also mean that yen crosses should go up we will see

--- 帖子 #386 ---
bought eur/jpy at 118.72 based on m15 bullish divergence SL 45 pips last open position for today

--- 帖子 #387 ---
And maybe one more chance with swissy m5 possible bull zone rejection took short at 12168 SL 25 pips

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Just cant wait to see it at 1.18 then 1.15 h1 momentum ema20 resistance m5 in bear zone m15 is aproaching to bear zone and momentum below ema100 finally lost 1% on eur/aud swissy move SL to 12143 locked 1% eur/jpy moved SL to 119 locked 0.6%

--- 帖子 #389 ---
We are breaking daily ema14 again i hope this time will end up with success Anyway if body of the candle will close below ema14 i announce USD selloff tournament

--- 帖子 #390 ---
m15 ema14 so i added another short will drop or will punch my screen...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Good evening 5, Here what I see on H1 both 2 Stoch and mom heading north so I took a long, so be careful but, as u knos I may be wrong

--- 帖子 #392 ---
As u probably aware im that guy who love to fight with major trend LOL OK i will be carefull I have a feeling USD PPT is working hard and everytime when price is breaking daily ema14 they click "buy" button

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I believe we are in a choppy period and I agree they aren't ready to let USD fall ( Obama effect ????)

--- 帖子 #394 ---
LOL that was good Be careful 1min short signal has been generated.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
yeah quick short signal and very fast recovery but small bearish div on m1 near UTL question is is it enough to break flag to downside

--- 帖子 #396 ---
lets try this bought geppy 13580 with SL 40 pips m5 possible bear zone rejection + momentum rising

--- 帖子 #397 ---
price still below ema14 momentum still below ema20 im waiting for daily candle close then sleep time so one or two more chart still to come

--- 帖子 #398 ---
good night 5 it's all for me

--- 帖子 #399 ---
night mate one more hour and im off too see ya in the morning

--- 帖子 #400 ---
daily close on ema14 From the candlestick point of view we have a doji today after dark cloud cover yesterday. long upper shadow suggest selling pressure. Thats why im short biased but thats me candle is neutral and we need a confirmation tomorow. Good night

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Good morning eur/jpy stochs in bull zone so we are well prepared to break ema120 today. yesterday ema120 was tough wall.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
my last geppy long is doing great so far first resistance near 138 area then ema120

--- 帖子 #403 ---
stochs near bear zone border we have to break ema204 to reverse uptrend.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
good morning 5, I believe geppy will retrace very soon so time to take some profit ?????

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi James partial profit taken on hourly ema120 locked 80 pips thats 1% and should be fine for me in swissy got locked 3% already each trade is 1% risk with flexible position sometimes 25pips is 1% or 65pips depend on pair. usually for usd/chf and eur/usd is 25-30 pips yen crosses 40-50 pips risk is 1% but reward is always above 2% most of the time 5-10% daily u cant lose with such MM What does ur MM look like ?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
took short on swissy at 12045 ema14 hourly SL 25 pips

--- 帖子 #407 ---
all look similar but Denamrk crown has generated signal already IMHO USD will collapse soon

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Im gonna buy around 11950 area support level made by previous day candle close and ema7 if broken then im short biased lookin for 11750 and lower. momentum crossed ema100 but stochs are flat in the middle of no mans land This might indicates low volume. With little Kmap help we should establish a nice uptrend but we need a lot of buyers near blue dashed line. Let see Good luck

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I'm a little bit more adventurous but my goal is to adopt quite soon some MM like yours....well thought mate

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Good MM is basic thing IMO if u wanna make trade for a living i was brave too but when i blown a few mini accounts all this courage dissapear somewhere LOL took short on swissy again near h3's ema52 12080 SL is 30 pips previous entry has been stopped at BE They are protecting bear zone border and drive me nuts... Also bought eur/jpy near h3 ema14 11962 SL is 50pips 1% risk each trade as usual

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I'll be off in the afternoon.... I usually find her analysis very interesting, maybe u will too especially explosion in forex trading ranges, which is directly related to MM http://www.gftforex.com/resources/an...t=Kathy%20Lien So good luck, see ya to-morrow

--- 帖子 #412 ---
found some very atractive setup on eur/chf eur supply or chf demand is needed daily very bullish h3 also bullish but h1 big bearish divergence and stoch already in bear zone. im lurking for short position though chf index is quite weak today and has been rangin since march

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks for link and later Moved SL to BE for both pairs no stress waiting for another setup Currently im watching this wedge and bear zone border.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
another great setup and low risk trade took short SL above 0.8765 big bearish div on h3

--- 帖子 #415 ---
im trying here short at 15610 SL 15635 m15 bull zone rejection

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Diamond formation breakout is coming BTW i had to stop eur/gbp manually was wrong entry cable still very weak. eur/chf OK eur/jpy OK usd/chf OK

--- 帖子 #417 ---
i had a lot of luck while i reveal this system. My sweet money machine usd/chf Wedge has been broken, price might need retest breakout. so I took partial profit below ema204(11955) just in the case because PPT is lurking too with their "buy" buttons LOL eur/jpy also took partial profit when m5 ema14 was broken eur/chf is Santa bonus set and forget.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
m1 ema204 was hit right to the pip so i took short now i got m1 sell signal

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Next resistance near ema204 (12170-122) im gonna partial TP there and tempting to take short if i will see bearish div on m5 at least m15 would be much better. h3 and h1 are bullish now so at least a few hours of climbing.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
All lines point 1.15 before Christmas so it will be for sure

--- 帖子 #421 ---
almost has reached the top we have a h1 bearish divergence on momentum but stochs are very bullish (96% level)

--- 帖子 #422 ---
bought dip below ema14 (12030) short not ready yet IMO automated system will push price to h3 ema204 dont follow me very risky trade

--- 帖子 #423 ---
m5 ema120 and second retest of the break out short at 1.1984 (Orwell book LOL)

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Good morning Took partial profit on swissy at daily ema34 (1.1899 exactly) Took partial profit on eur/jpy on h3 ema204 and reverse at 121.65 still holding usd/chf short positions 12168, eur/jpy long position from 11962 eur/chf closed at BE let see what Thursday will bring to us

--- 帖子 #425 ---
took small short on cable near h3's ema120 will add at 14970 if seen SL for both above 1.5 m5 sell signal generated near that ema. however h3 stoch in bullish zone.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
m5 bullish divergence near double bottom pattern will risk long position here SL 25 pips

--- 帖子 #427 ---
closed eur/jpy long changed to short bias and shorting all rally near emas targeting 118 or below possible channel LTL around 117.50 which is line up with Kmap major bullish line/angle(yellow dotted line) so might be massive support there also smaller support on blue dashed line (minor bullish TL/angle ) cable one postion closed rest on BE swissy SL moved to BE = no stress

--- 帖子 #428 ---
cable sell signal on m15

--- 帖子 #429 ---
usually good thing to do is always take partial profit on m15 ema52 because price might bounce off pretty fast from it. unfortunatelly i have missed it , nah well... m15 bear zone rejection was caused by m5 bullish divergence near daily ema34, now we have stochs in bull zone but price will test ema14 for sure.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Good morning 5, I see everything bullish on EurJpy.... By the way where are you trading from, I'm trading from Paris, most beautiful city in the world......

--- 帖子 #431 ---
well if we will be able to break ema204 on h3 then i agree meanwhile i will add to short momentum goes up but stoch is pushing to downside let see BTW cable and swissy stopped at BE i trade from small town near Cracow in Poland Also beautyfull "city"

--- 帖子 #432 ---
short added near UTL

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Yes we have a big difference on our sto.....so who's right ???? As u say let's see No answer for your trading town ?????

--- 帖子 #436 ---
took short on eur/chf as well ema204 daily and... m1 sell signal SL above 15770

--- 帖子 #437 ---
took short on eur/pln double top formation great opportunity for long term trade.

--- 帖子 #438 ---

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Really dont understand this BS euro demand im shorting eu all the way up to 1.33 with 25 pips step same with eur/chf this is probably stupid idea so dont follow me. closed FX platform and will see tomorow see ya next week i have not been trading on fidays lately

--- 帖子 #440 ---
What is Kmap ???? Thanks

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Kmap is a little something what cost me a few hundred bucks when i fought with big sell off on carries in September and October LOL Frankly speaking i created Gann grid modification and called Kaleidescope Map(Kmap) Mostly is woking nicely combined with stochRsi system is really very powerfull tool for charting. Market has a fixed geometry and trends/channels is moving with same angle all the time.Once u draw it and u are able to predict future hehe Just kidding but turning point of the market why not Descrption of the Kmap and instruction how to build it. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...45#post2232545 Im addicted too LOL

--- 帖子 #442 ---
eu is retracting finally... took short on eur/jpy price has a problem to breach ema14 on m30 soon will enter to bear zone on m30 and this will cause h1 sell signal.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
cut losses on eur/usd eur/jpy eur/chf at least im scoring big time on shorts with usd/chf usd/pln eur/pln usd/huf very good day though

--- 帖子 #444 ---
U can say whatever u want about my trading style(i have a space for any improvement yet ) but this system is working u cant deny even if u want heh USD sell off tournament just begun LTL of the channel hit as expected now should be small retracement(or not) and continue tanking mode... we have a reversal on daily finally if 1.15-1.13 broken then 1.08 next target

--- 帖子 #445 ---
bought geppy with SL below last candle open (13719) maybe little late but stochs are in bull zone so worth to try for me.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
ema34 momentum below ema20 and stoch near bull zone border good setup for short position ema52 would be even better

--- 帖子 #447 ---
What was that Kmap rules Bounce off perfectly to the pip from bullish mayor TL/angle. Tell me again its the waste of time. Or try to explain it. I said Kmap. and you ?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi 5, I don't know if you can trade oil with your broker, it seems there is a very good opportunity...

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Usd is collapsing.....

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Next week should be very bullish for EUR and bearish for both USD and JPY Next target is red dotted line (major bearish TL/angle) once broken uptrend will continue. This late asian's session slump action just cleared many accounts and let big boys load the long position.Common behaviour. Bullish setup valid as long as price stay above blue dashed line. We have a chance for 138/140 even early next year. Trade well and be prepared. SL and partial profit are keys to the success. i bet for pinbar or shooting star on yen index today.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi JJ Well unfortunately cant trade oil on Oanda but maybe maybe one day. However i can trade silver and this commodiite is very profitable to trading but also very dangerous. From 10$ used margin u can make 100$ in just one day but when u will predict trend direction... well u know the answer

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I can trade silver too with a 50 pips spread, what's ur spread ans ur analysis for next week thanks

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I prefer level trading when i trade ssilver this is very simple method S/R levels are on figure and .50 level Just look at the chart red horizontal lines are major S/R and yeloww ones are minor S/R level. Stochrsi system point upside move defianately but we have to clear daily ema 52 first. this should give us a green light for easy money For now price is ranging between 9-10.5$/oz follow the breakout of this consolidation. Spread on Oanda is similar like urs but is showing 5000pips instead

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Yes it's 5000 pips too I' ll try next week...now I have to leave... See ya next week, good luck and nice week end

--- 帖子 #456 ---
yeah but ordinary one day move is from 50000-100000 pips(0.5-1$) So its worth the risk Have a nice weekend too i will watch it for a while. EDIT sorry wrong spread is 500pips but moves is 5000-10000 pips daily

--- 帖子 #457 ---
short has been reloaded PLN index weekly doji but USD is going down so emerging market currencies might be good investments. SL above doble top 4.0 pychological border.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
closer look for eur/pln h3's stochs bounce off nicely from ema20 resistance + mom below ema20/100 3.8 is next target then we will see how market react

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Last chart today Possible price range for next year SL(short) below LTL of the wedge TP(short) on UTL of the wedge Break of green dashed TL will give us green light and cause hit of major UTL(red) of the downtrend channel. Have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Below are eur index charts monthly and quarterly as u can see euro's showing tremendous strength. selling euro is rather bad idea

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Well here is all clear also. GBP is worth less than carrot monthly and qurterly charts

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Situation here is more complex, Breakout of the triangle now has hit UTL of the channel and is retracting making pinbar on daily chart. maybe break out retest ? very bullish on monthly and quarterly but on daily we have a pinbar and weekly is perfect doji therefore direction is unknown.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
isnt bull flag ? yes it is quarterly and monthly charts

--- 帖子 #464 ---
And finally USD One of triangles has been broken but there is bigger one yet on monthly pinbar so far but month has not been over yet. Weekly dark cloud cover might turn to bearish engulfing next week. Very bearish IMO quarterly,monthly and weekly charts

--- 帖子 #465 ---
sold usd/cad h3 momentum ema20 resistance + stochRSI bear zone border

--- 帖子 #466 ---
bought eur/jpy SL=short at 12190 momentum on m5 get support at ema20 h1 approaching to bull zone border m30 on border already only m15 show small bearish div target is red dotted TL risk to reward ratio is 1:6 for single trade

--- 帖子 #467 ---
m15 is turning to bearish now looks like h1 bear zone rejection on double top pattern. last support at 121.50 area if taken out im short let see EDIT bought the dip

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Good morning 5, Shall we try to to play with silver this week ??? on demo account for me

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Currently I'm short on GJ, EJ and UJ....following ur system...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
We could try but this is still boring period for silver trading ema52 resistance if taken out then volatility comes in. i bet for break out today or tommorow because of momentum made death cross on daily.Short consider only below ema14 daily.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
could u provide more info please charts, TFs ,TP/reversal areas Thank u

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I'm with ODL and can trade oil, gold, silver....and indices, futures and even CFD.... a lot of fun for everyday....

--- 帖子 #473 ---
You are the expert ...OK I show you, what I see.... I use principally H4....which is bearish for UJ, mom down and Stoch ready to get in bearzone...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
For Gj which is more volatile my decision TF is H1 an here again everything is bearish....and my TP is 132,50 My first trade is usually without SL, and if it's against me with same favorable data I enter a new trade and set a relatively short SL (&lt;50) with a TP at BE of the first trade....I hope I'm clear

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Please be carefull with this shorts From creator point of view we are still above stoch's ema20 on h3/h4 also i see small bullish div in momentum on daily

--- 帖子 #476 ---
For Ej my decision TF is H4 and we are close to UTL, so I bet for retracement ans see some premices in that direction...especially my special Stos.... My TL is 120,50 (retracement)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks for the advice.....I'll use SL

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Might be reatracement but is too early to say it for sure because m30 stoch get support on bull zone border. Time for last wave up.Very fast and sharp wave number 5 IMO

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I'm out at BE on GJ....it seems ur right my shorts were not as adequate as I thought....forgot looking at daily

--- 帖子 #480 ---
out on ej too....still learning

--- 帖子 #481 ---
out on uj...... Don't u think on EurUsd we are very close to a retracement... Thanks

--- 帖子 #482 ---
bearish div on hourly so yes we are very close but eu might jump up 300 pips even before she will retract

--- 帖子 #483 ---
very exciting session m15 left bear zone but momentum still almost flat most of the times up nd down ping pong shit but m5 is tryin to enter bullzone for while hopefully im waiting for this event...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
ema34 daily time to TP some rest on BE = no stress easy money

--- 帖子 #485 ---
m1 bearish div with double top pattern =partially TP again

--- 帖子 #486 ---
short here SL above top partial TP is 60 pips below then SL to BE sell signall on m5 forming

--- 帖子 #487 ---
m1 in bear zone already m5 signal confirmed in 60% (momentum below emas and ema crossed but stochs migght bounce from border) we are fighting for m15 now ema14 is providing strong support as usual EDIT stop and reverse UTL break with rising momentum on m1

--- 帖子 #488 ---
i dont like it either closed with small loss need some sleep havent been sleepin since early asian session so see ya on London open SL for rest of ej long position is placed below ema14 hourly night

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Good morning Plan for today is short the yen crosses probably... geppy faces up again with ema120 on h3.. support around 137 figure and little below(ema14/34/52)) if broken u know what to do right ?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
short is gettin closer waiting for h3 signal nd short the euro for 500+pips

--- 帖子 #491 ---
took small short on our new beast SL is 100 pips=1% ema14 hourly seems will be broken if so then h1 sell signal confirmed. enough for now

--- 帖子 #492 ---
eur/pln pln still very weak eur just broke 4.0 barrier trades closed no more trade on this pair

--- 帖子 #493 ---
also closed all usd/pln trades comparing to HUF and DKK Polish Zloty is very weak

--- 帖子 #494 ---
OK time to TP some on near my first target (~1.15) SL moved above daily ema14 might be bear zone rejection on daily

--- 帖子 #495 ---
multi resistance area according to Kmap starting to build short positions waiting for clear signal to short harder and harder ... h1 sell signal forming

--- 帖子 #496 ---
short taken and will be adding all the way up to 1.6 also will be adding on all retracements so there will be no update until ema14 daily

--- 帖子 #497 ---
CAD also weak like PLN does closed i dont like it anymore h3 stoch in bear zone but price still hangin above 1.22 and momentum goes up

--- 帖子 #498 ---
im expecting last push to red doted line or green line(this is also possible because there is ema52 daily) so i bought dip near ema14 on h3 h3 still bullish

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Good morning 5, I made a lot of work yesterday after my bad trades lol....i think I better understand now your strategy... I also modified slightly the data for MT4 StochRSI (65,250,2) which seems to me closer to yours..... My question: what made precisely take this decision on EurChf Thanks a lot to share with us

--- 帖子 #500 ---
On H1 mom down again and moreover USD should be sold before to-day's announcements...don't u think so ????

--- 帖子 #501 ---
forgot graph.....

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I think the euro power must rest fort a while OK most important things is fear/greed psychology in traders behaviour So everyone know about ~1.6 UTL of the wegde therefore they try to TP everytime when price is close to UTL of this rising wedge (red) they TP and price is retracting slowly losing momentum but when price near emas then automated systems are pushing the price higher to create great offer for central banks. So on the chart we will see divergence in momentum (huge amount of money is entering market from single institution=no momentum ) This is one of my stupid theory i have plenty of it but i do not have any proof Im have been lurking for this short since 1.56 u know. h1 respect ema14 as resistance so i pull the trigger

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Maybe so if will break this TL then im in

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I'll be short at 1,23 TP 1,2150 (fib)

--- 帖子 #505 ---
will risk long here partial TP ema120 again reason h3 stoch on support (ema20 and border) SL=short 100 pips = 2%

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I see many differences with ur StochRSI so could u edit your indicator and give me the values for RSI periods, Percent K and Percent D. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #507 ---
yen index still strong friday - pinbar confirmed by small bearish candle day after today - harami so far so will follow the breakout (break of the range of prior candle) if up then short yen crosses if down then pinbar confirmed and we have trend reversal let see

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I dumped MT4 because of the stochRSI wrong signals i cant edit indicator im not a programmer We need help From oanda 's indicator settings are 65,70,30 Thats all i hope this could help u somehow

EDIT added second stochRSI indicator because previous ine might be buggy a little try and choose

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi JJ i have a problem again... This indicator is buggy or i have to get faster CPU its using 100% resources whenever i try move chart,draw line or make a transaction etc I have 1GHz pentuim III (i know this is not a demon of speed but has been enough till now ) Any clue...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I have the same problem.....and I'm not a programmer too....so I'll try to see if I can do sth but not for sure, we need a good programmer to examine the code

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I did sth which gives some results....tell me if it works for you too.....

--- 帖子 #525 ---
nope still same sh..........

--- 帖子 #526 ---
notice the daily momentum no comment

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I've found a new one which gives same results without CPU fall, anyway on my computer, tell me if it's OK for you

--- 帖子 #528 ---
i think i have to change CPU to core2duo at least Thanks anyway EDIT seems it does works faster U r da man !!!

--- 帖子 #529 ---

--- 帖子 #534 ---

Be careful here Weekly important levels !!!

--- 帖子 #537 ---

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi JJ Now u are in charge here u know how system works Lead the ppl i have to limit post here for a while Please show me ur skills and i will correct u or not best pair to trade is fiber and geppy today i suppose so whats ur status

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Please stay with us....and I have absolutely no more interest in position of leader....already achieved.... For fiber I'll be waiting to know if ema mom H1 will act as support or no

--- 帖子 #541 ---
For geppy my feeling is trend to resume soon, but I'll wait for prices staying awhile below H4 ema 14 (137,86) before pulling trigger I'll have a look at oil and indices to find faster opportunities....

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I will be here but just limit my analysis to 2-3 daily Fiber.. h1 left bull zone already so watch carefully if will bounce from ema20 and border also switch to lower TF's and look for border bounces this is best signal. Please dont sugest my open position, no guarantee

--- 帖子 #543 ---
agree TL broken but ema34 might be support on h4 my suggestion is ema90 works better on h4 chart(same as ema120 on h3)

--- 帖子 #544 ---
seems cable entering bullish territory confirmed....ready to trigger...

--- 帖子 #545 ---
no !!! mate dont do it samething is really fu@#ed up here Oanda daily chart

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Ok useful work Now I have sth more simlar to yours.... at least....

--- 帖子 #547 ---
WTF wrong with momentum same settings MT4 brokers are trying to fu@#ed up or what dont get it

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Send me yours.......

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Can you send me code of your mom indicator ???

--- 帖子 #550 ---
yes sure MT4 indicator right ?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
no Vt mom indicator

--- 帖子 #552 ---
send me the Oanda weekly where you found those differences.....please

--- 帖子 #553 ---
this is oanda not VT They have a java based application code is on server site and i suppose is closed.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
it was daily oanda doesnt support weekly chart (and i really pissed off because of that)

--- 帖子 #555 ---
OK send me this Oanda daily chart

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I sent you an email didn' you get it ?????

--- 帖子 #557 ---
There are not different ways to calculate a momentum....so thereis just a need to adapt the numer of periods and you'll get your beloved pattern.....

--- 帖子 #558 ---
sorry was busy scalping read ur email sent me PM instead OK and i cant sent u chart i dont know how and what do u ask for even dunno

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Look at this with mom 42

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Here is an exemple of big difference between mom 42,43 or 44....so what' the best ??????

--- 帖子 #561 ---
i think none ... unfortunatelly

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I know the differences come from Brokers cos different GMT time for start of the day.... I downloaded Oanda and so I can adjust more easily but we'll always have some difference... I believe here is the closest I will find, try it and see how you can trade with it....template is updated ODL starts at 00.00h GMT....

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Here is the latest template....I'm quite confident these figures respect the spirit and the basis of your system, and is tradable on MT platforms, so here we are.... I finally got my own system, strongly inspired by yours....so I won't need too much testing, I use the same principles as you....

--- 帖子 #564 ---
great opportunity IMO momentum rising near bear zone border see chart

--- 帖子 #565 ---
took my profit not yet apperently.. u cant be right everytime.. u have to share ur money from time to time with other ppl Lets the volatility guide us next week cheers and wish u great weekend

--- 帖子 #566 ---
standing up yet so a few charts after weekly close let see

--- 帖子 #567 ---
ok here we are yen index daily still bullish so yen crosses will go down but we are near bottom(in yen crosses) i suppose i dont have momentum indi with this chart its shame but.. from the candlestick point of view this is a divergence move pushing by automated system anything can happens now prepare to dump yen soon for 50% retracement

--- 帖子 #568 ---
what can say huge bounce from TL dollah just started nice rally IMO

--- 帖子 #569 ---
eur index only weekly chart rest of prediction is here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...42#post2426042 false break out ECB gonna flood market soon IMO

--- 帖子 #570 ---
GBP dumping continue no demand long upper shadow indicates selling pressure (or long cover if someone has such patience or stupidity ) weekly chart

--- 帖子 #571 ---
chf index i told about bullish flag here are a results now i can go to sleep remeber market is based on human behavoiur humans are very predictible (especially their prgrammed behaviour)

--- 帖子 #572 ---
1st image just take a look at this huge divergence in momentum. If scenario from circled area will happen we should see fiber near parity next year.Monthly trend change has to be confirmed. 2nd image shadow is longer than body this indicate selling pressure. just a scenario what might to happens based on previous patterns from the past.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
a few charts before market open geppy first on daily chart geppy is looking for bottom every new LL is a opportunity to exit short position we can see such behaviour on daily momentum. momentum is sitting now ema20 so it might be support but remember we are in very strong downtrend dont try to pick a bottom is not worth a risk. h3 chart we are trading below ema14 so bias is rather south unless we break this ema. LTLs are way below 130 so price might drop further very fast and furious stoch in bearzone but momentum has been sticked to emas thus im FLAT very tricky market at this price level. h1 chart falling wedge formation usually bearish pattern to downside with huge momentum (do u remember swissy green wedge near 1.21 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...40#post2408840 ) Nothing is certain only high or low probabilities

--- 帖子 #574 ---
We have seen such setup many times ema14 support ema52 resistance very simple price range price might drop below ema14 but also could me many buy orders there. So watch PA on lower TFs and if u will see on h3 long lower shadow and close above ema14 u should know what does it mean already

--- 帖子 #575 ---
eur/chf is acting very predictable so far 1.37 as TP ? maybe maybe

--- 帖子 #576 ---
looks like double bottom near TL to me my target 1.7 still valid

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Divergence move has been lasting since 20 Nov so reversal is very very close but how about 1000 pips drop before ?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
similar here with such momentum and stochs in bull zone we should see at lest 62% retracement if wont then something is blocking further surge.. oanda doesnt provide weekly chart so MT4 is very helpfull and as u can see on weekly we just hit ema20 on weekly momentum which is also ema14 on price chart. bet for new LL soon(wave nr 5) 110 maybe ?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
i think i found something special i would say break out retest so short the AUD daily ema 200 is SAR place if broken ofc

--- 帖子 #580 ---
CAD should be fueled by this

--- 帖子 #581 ---
i like this thread very much but very confused not understanding it all could some body be kind to share some time with me sending the rules to enter and exit in trade and which pair are considered for this strategy thx

--- 帖子 #582 ---
5ysfx can you show us your positive result?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
you are misunderstanding me i am not asking results or your system but asking how can i get involved into this system can i get the real method to getin and out what would be my entry and exit and on which behalf could you be nice to give me instructions for this system and not results

--- 帖子 #584 ---
do u read all posts with understanding ? 1)dont pick bottom/top 2)dont try to fight with major trend (use SL) 3)never open position when momentum is flat for a few hours 4)open bigger position only on break out of the flags 5)when daily/h3/h1 stochRSI is in bear zone dont open long position much safer is to open short position near emas instead and vice versa when stochs are in bull zone. 6)open first position when double bottom/top pattern occur with divergence. 7)use m5 for starting point 8)exit is ur next entry and rememember to take partial profits near emas or fibs 9)hunt for "rejections"

--- 帖子 #585 ---
sorry but i dont understand u im showing my results all the time what do u expect for history, my bank account statement or maybe just my personal details ? if u interested to this system try it if not leave this thread peacefully, Well u do like choosing so now is ur turn. Try it or GTFOH...

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hello preopen view Well i expected more euro dump last week, this didint happen We probably wont see final leg down soon more upside still to come, daily is strictly bullish (stoch in bull zone + momentum getting speed) h3 is leaving bear zone. 133 (161.8%) is my first target then after small retracement 140(261.8%) yen index should drop this and next week Weekly candle broke 3 weeks open/close range.Long upper shadow indicates selling pressure. Goodluck

--- 帖子 #587 ---
no SL hunting ? amazing yen index points down gbp index points up (candle close above prior candle ) so time to play bullish div on daily TF for geppy daily mom bounce off ema20 also "death cross" is coming + stochs ready to leave bear zone finally.Corection toward ema52 then likely higher.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
daily bullish h3 is bearish/neutral but h1 is bullish now (stoch bull zone + mom aboe emas) thus h3 should turn to neutral/bullish today in London session let see let me help u with chart interpretation (indicators only)

--- 帖子 #589 ---
last trades was very wrong i switched back to position trading so no more intraday update here. one analysis only today jpy index weekly chart finally down green pips to u all and happy weekend

--- 帖子 #590 ---
not yet

--- 帖子 #591 ---
finally bounce last week candle is pretty bullish stoch in bull zone momentum above ema20 death crossed occured ema14 should be support now this huge divergence is playing now

--- 帖子 #592 ---
m15 possible bull zone rejection short SL above double top target LTL

--- 帖子 #593 ---
chunnel up SL below .8650 aiming .9000(ema50 daily) or higher UTL of the wedge h1 momentum above ema20 and stoch in bull zone already

--- 帖子 #594 ---
134.50 double bottom out of short positions might be final divergence push before major retracement daily is very bullish h3 is turning to bearish slowly target 140 SL 134

--- 帖子 #595 ---
looks like south direction on h1 is possible shampoo formation also possible bull zone rejection on m15 on daily stoch been in bear zone since a few weeks short order at 12485 just in the case SL +12550 TP ~1.1

--- 帖子 #596 ---
swissy is lookin good too short orders at 1.17 and 1.175 SL above 1.18 TP 1.06

--- 帖子 #597 ---
chunnel is going down On h1 we can see bearish divergence and stoch's ema20 becomes a resistance. Next upmove (if any) should be short lived, H3 is bullish though. downtrend should continue daily stoch in bear zone near ema20 resistance short orders in 50 pips step from .9020 to .9270 SL + .930 primary TP around .84 then lower if broken

--- 帖子 #598 ---
GBP demand might rise pretty soon daily bullish (at support) h3 bearish (watch 1.44x- key level) h1 is changing to bullish if scenario will be correct then primary TP is daily ema120 (1.57-1.60 area) SL or short below 1.40

--- 帖子 #599 ---
As long as stochs stay in bullish zone and momentum above ema20 i am "dipbuyer" 142 primary target 150 would be nice SL or short below today's low

--- 帖子 #600 ---
So far so good u can catch looney yet See ya next week

I know there are many experienced traders who think bearish on GBP but i couldnt see clear reason yet beside one thing global financial crisis Anyway according to this system. Daily Bulls outside bar here momentum supported at ema20 (ema crossed already) stochs left bear zone and is moving up steady Overall bullish divergence might be played out but only worried me long upper shadow of last candle(selling pressure) Weekly weekly ema14 is very strong resistance but we can notice three outside up pattern http://www.candlesticker.com/Cs62.asp past weeks Last week drop was quite small ( have a look at stochs still moving up) Weekly has no bias technically Very suspicious ...

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Daily stochs left bear zone and supported on bear zone border momentum supported at ema20 (ema20/100 crossed already) Price has been moving along TL so far. No sign of bears activity. Weekly final resistance ahead of us weekly ema14 also ema 20 on momentum and stoch Note LZX/JPY chart is inverted so moving up means JPY getting weaker.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
waiting for break out Daily stoch got hard time near bull zone border bears won 2 times so far Weekly will stoch's ema20 turn to resistance ? still in bull zone though and get supported at ema14

--- 帖子 #604 ---
neutral channel. Daily bull zone rejected on 6th of January then bear zone was rejected 2nd of February. Weekly stoch ema20 might be support so bias slightly bullish. Overall looks like bear flag in wave 4. We will see how american indices react soon.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
got room yet Daily and weekly Bulls are trying to sustain above bear zone. momentum is going to drop below ema100 hmm tough call.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Here is quite clear direction Bias is bullish both daily and weekly unless she breaks the LTL. Looks like bull flag is forming. Does this mean oil will go up ?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
small long here with tight SL could be worth a shot h3 on support h1 might be bear zone rejection. Counter trend trade so be carefull

--- 帖子 #608 ---
m15 long signal has been generated SL at 12950

--- 帖子 #609 ---
fiber got same setup as cabel h1 bear zone rejection with rising momentum ~1.29 seems reasonable target then we will see SL put below 1.2750

--- 帖子 #610 ---
may just start in any minute...

--- 帖子 #611 ---
party spoiled on Asian session bounce off 1.1570 ema14 daily support shouldnt have ignore rising momentum on daily once again system has shown right direction but my biased mind picked wrong one. no reason to go short yet on any USD pairs

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Well we know about USD strength USD/JPY is in small uptrend as long as stays above ema14 and ema52 resistance at ema100/120 (~94.00-95.00) support at ema52 (91.50) and ema14 (91.00) GBP/JPY Beast stays above ema14 on daily but is quite weak just look at SP500 mini future for reference. From the system point of view we are going up as long price stays above ema14. GBP/USD so if USD will push GBP below 1.40 we may see GBP/JPY in tanking mode till then USD/JPY is a driver for the beast therefore should be choppy action on GBP/JPY

--- 帖子 #613 ---
low risk trade long SL 100pips reward 350-1000pips bear zone rejection likely because of rising momentum

--- 帖子 #614 ---
daily stoch at support worth a small long here with 50pips SL next bigger support is LTL near 0.63 h3 and lower TFs are bearish only m5 left bear zone so far

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Now looks like classic bull flag momentum start to rise im watchin 1.26 area

--- 帖子 #616 ---
SL above first shoulder price looks really good on h3

--- 帖子 #617 ---
i took risk and sold that move

--- 帖子 #618 ---
CAD index at major support now same situation on JPY index (inverted chart so TL should be resistance) short usd/cad long cad/jpy might be good idea, of course wait for signal on lower TFs no need to hurry

--- 帖子 #619 ---
eu long with 20 pips SL TP ema52 on h1 intraday low risk opportunity

--- 帖子 #620 ---
imho now is a proper time to switch USD to some other currency only not JPY

--- 帖子 #621 ---
eur/chf still open because of gbp/chf long opportunity just started to buy all the way down untill 1.65 momentum is moving up very fast near bull zone border aiming double top or maybe higher so my daily bias(next coming days) is eurchf long usd/cad short cad/jpy long gbj/jpy long gbp/chf long eur/gbp short now i have to wait time will tell.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
1st target met 94 ema100 Time to TP some and take small short position near double top(ema100 daily) m15 divergence now target 92.70

--- 帖子 #623 ---
daily close jpy index - as expected cad index - as expected - bull flag not broken yet though usd index - break out ? double top fear ? i dont trust this up move aud index - as expected slightly up eur index - will bounce or not ? last chance today gbp index - looks strong daily closed above ema14 with long lower shadow. chf index - sideways between ema200 and wma 45 heat map strongest GBP, AUD weakest JPY, USD(probably from now)

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Hi 5YSFX, I was looking for a system (daily) with Oanda indicators and just saw your thread right now. How is your system working? Is it live? Thanks, -FX_California

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I dont understand ur question Please be more specific system works very well for me on live account.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
there is a possibility for 0.57 daily stoch at ema20 support

--- 帖子 #627 ---
battle at ema52 (74.80) Like I mentioned many times ema52 is ALWAYS good place to take partial TP. daily looks strong(stoch at over 96% level) if broken then next TP is ema100/120 area also previous top and med line in the current upward channel.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
We got first bounce off from bear zone border 3 days without making new LL and we got clean rejection on daily combined with false breakout Many sellers might stuck there So 1st TP at ema100/120 then maybe near UTL of the cyan wedge Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
So if cad/jpy break ema50 then loonie heads to ~1.1 level March should be similar to December so i shorted USD.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
ONLY FOR REFERENCE I know this will be funny but... We are heading down below 700$ per oz H3 big divergence stoch is leaving bull zone and momentum below ema100 daily even bigger divergence and double top possibility Might be bull zone rejection on weekly and stoch ema20 may turn to resistance on monthly TF Just small curiosity and little trial for this system

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Good evening folks I believe we got true med or maybe longterm reversal now If so then USD will suffer badly in coming months. Finaly got name for my system : 5's pathfinder 1) After i joined the FF comunity i predicted reversal on USD index http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1032 2) December's USD sell-off it was started here http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...ostcount=47518 3) Today's USD sell-off I hope they will push swissy below parity again. USD has been sold hard vs CHF at weekly ema200 now is forming weekly shooting star pattern. DISCLAIMER Of course i had many wrong calls in the past therefore still learning and mastering this method. Follow if want but only at ur own risk. Wish u all great weekend and see ya near next reversal spot

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I see potential short in EUR/AUD According to system is great time to do it NOW SL above 2.0 Reward is over 1000pips worth All we need is AUD/USD push up above current resistance 0.65-0.67 area Break of the flag(0.62 area) to downside is ofc opposite signal. Do not over leverage ur position i blew one of my subaccount in October because of that. Good luck P.S. metatrader chart showes a demo overleveraged position oanda's chart is normal real small short position. In other words im in AUD bull camp.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Well im not so sure about USD sell off coming now. I have doubts so i have closed all my USD position right now. USD/CAD bounce off LTL of the triangle again and daily close above ema14 This is bad sign for USD bear camp but good sign for USD bull camp There is always two side of the same coin. equities goes down big time i think i will buy yen soon So reversal news was way too soon from my side. I am sorry.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
today is that day bye

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Time to fill Saxo "prediction" IMHO direction is south : GBP/JPY 85.0 AUD/JPY 45.0 EUR/USD 1.10 GBP/USD 1.20 SILVER 5.0 ETA : till end of the year GL &amp; GT 2 all see ya next year

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Well it was bad entry for sure, too early and was not confirmed therefore i had to activate myself earlier than at the end of year 2009 I should have been waited either for stochRSI leave bearzone and momentum below ema100 or daily ema200 hit also patiently wait for death cross on momentum which is actually happen right now.However my target is still valid. a few charts for big picture. USD/PLN worth a shot not confirmed though. USD/CHF same as above GBP/JPY confirmed via stochRSI (bounce off ema20 in bull zone) AUD/JPY same as above but better momentum gained EUR/GBP not confirmed but stoch is going up steady EUR/AUD looks best

--- 帖子 #637 ---
While the yen is doin hard work lets have a closer look to usd h4 is about to break ema100 soon this mean acceleration on daily stoch moving steady upward momentum closes to ema100. usd is late as in the dentarthurdent its a sort of threat do you see ?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Also here south gate is open wide according to system of course.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
seems we have a leader stochrsi in bear zone and momentum's emas crossed already. a few more words classic pullback to test breakout easy money.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
watch ema14/wma45 support also momentum ema20 support if hold then will be safe to go long.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
same here but in opposite direction naturally. first target lays at ~1.53 161.8% fibo ext and daily sma100 wma200.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
entered to bull zone looks really good for +1K pips target.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Price down while daily momentum rises (or i can say si fading only because is stil below 0) good setup to enter long but mentioned earlier reversal not confirmed yet so only for those who like risk. Tricky trade Good luck !!

--- 帖子 #644 ---
seems it found support on fibo level(it is 61.8% but i drew upside down to show possible targets) after repealed from UTL as u can see momentum steady rises this is good sign for dollah strenght in following weeks. return of stoch into bear zone will negate this setup.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
good setup to enter short position with SL above shoulder watch stoch carefully R:R approx 10:1

--- 帖子 #646 ---
loonie is in trouble big big trouble and will hurt badly vs most currencies monthly momentum's ema20 support target 1.5

--- 帖子 #647 ---
gold chart reminds me cable from last year somehow. i wonder if we will see a copy

--- 帖子 #648 ---
With a little bit of Kmap help we will see that next uptrend might start only around 119 where is the proper place according principles. uptrend starters are marked by white circles at the chart if somenone is confused hehe. Link to principles is on first page on my journal if someone is interested.Kmap title.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I have no f.. idea what will be next here if fiber goes down and swissy goes up which one will be faster ? this is the ultimate question

--- 帖子 #650 ---
crap, even indices are identical flip the coin

--- 帖子 #651 ---
fiber in tank mode closed below ema14 high wick indicates selling pressure. target for now is 1.37 area where is ema200

--- 帖子 #652 ---
beast breaks weekly ema14 after has rejected at bull zone border. taget is 14270 for time being, we have to see reaction there first to decide whether goes straight to test bottom or bounce to test ema14 as resistance.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
turkish lira will be best scorer most probably

--- 帖子 #654 ---
bottom retest likely next week see chart u will be know why

--- 帖子 #655 ---
kiwi also shows us a good setup breakout to upside from upward channel failed now we are watching run for test daily sma100 but i bet that will break it like others majors

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I have some of free time so lets have a look on indices in current state. USD index weekly and yearly you know picture is worth a thousand words.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
though call - shadow on TL we have to wait a few days

--- 帖子 #658 ---
If I remeber well I presented almost same chart already half year ago but I paste it again. Upward channel we are currently in consolidation state before she fall to test LT. In other words 180 as target one 160 area for target two.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
This prediction was most succesfull, exactly 50% retracement as I said a couple of months ago.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Seems like trend is fading especially when second halft of the year might be dollar positive but who gonna sell gold these days ? This was last one chart for today see ya next week.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
ema14 retest = 2nd time neckline retest = change of med-term trend confirmation

--- 帖子 #662 ---
USD appreciation in comin' months applied to all USD/xxx pairs Below is example how everything fits together : waves, fibos, time cycles, rabbits just everything, In this way we can anticipate one leg of infinite probabilities. which likeky might happen and moreover put it in time. ~4.5 by november 2009 for USD/PLN

--- 帖子 #663 ---
today we should see break the range either way in cable due to news from technical point of view we are near UTL of downward channel from system point of view we could see rejection on h3 which might start exactly now.(see m15 chart) low risk trade opportunity short now SL place above 1.63 target exepected 1.58 R:R 7:1

--- 帖子 #664 ---
cable disappointed me today... took short on geppy for mentioned target I am out for couple of days so there won't be update untill further notice. GL &amp; GT all.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Bluechips spoiled the party for a few days, but IMHO this does not change anything. My view is still bullish for USD. On attached pictures you can see reaction when price has hit red dotted line, as you know (or maybe not) this line represents very powerful resistance. My view will change only when price break this line. Once the price break cyan line say hello to 1.36 then 1.30 Also there is another issue. We are in the middle of the month so mostly this is reversal period. I reapet once again take partial profit and some day u will be very suprised. Please do not follow me anymore (if someone does) unless you are able to manage your margin and patience. See ya

--- 帖子 #666 ---
I do not know what it is but certainly it is very important somehow. If someone has any idea just let me know.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I just flip the coin and will try to short this hell out arround 15270-15350 with 100pips SL for 1300 pips target.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
daily chart USD supported at ema20 on momentum weekly chart USD supported at ema100 on momentum

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Patience is everything in this business. Next week should be very interesting, Just take a look on price behaviour when was near red dotted line. Rejected three times CB's scare this line to death Time to fall... Have a nice weekend all and trade well. GL &amp; GT

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Today I received confirmation for GBP and USD. I marked rejection(red circle), confirmation(green circle) spots and possible rejection area (blue circle). U can compare all of these places by urself. Also my EW count indicates end of subwave 2 in wave 2 for dollar and if i am right we will see start of wave 3 next week.Sorry for messy chart but this was only way to show you targets. I can turn off my laptop and go to sleep now... ....please wait....loading....

--- 帖子 #671 ---
GBP/JPY After retest of neckline i believe is time to fall finallly ema 20 on stochRSI and momentum act like resistance so according to this system this is signal for trend reversal. Cable acts similar and i can say even better. Momentum is starting to break ema100, soon we should see USD big boom. BTW i returned to my original settings with emas no more experiments on this field.One thing i added SMA 100 because many traders respect her especially on daily TF.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
"In the name of people, freedom, and, uh... democracy, stuff like that, I hereby kidnap myself and I'm taking the ship with me. Whoo! Come on!"

--- 帖子 #673 ---
When price broke mentioned red line gone for +100 pips Like i said before when cyan would be broken then path to south should be open.Therefore took short on fiber for 1388 target with SL at 14263 This is low risk trade for me. let see

--- 帖子 #674 ---
just food for thought where aussie is goin ?

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Another interesting thing I found This might be some sort of harmonic pattern, described shortly here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...ds#post2140251 I compared USD/JPY weekly chart with current GBP/JPY 4H chart. As you can see PA is almost identical but currently it happens on FFWD I wonder how this gonna end.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I think it may start this week. Good R:R ratio StochRSI in bear zone already, final test above 1.25 (ema50 and sma100)

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Took short. I am riskin 70 pips for 1000 pips reward. let see...

--- 帖子 #678 ---
supports around 1.41(ema14 and red line) then 1.38(ema50 major uptrend line-angle) last one at 1.28 hope that works this time

--- 帖子 #679 ---
maybe now is proper time for short those two as well

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Momentum is quite good for break ema50 but there is last support at ema200 which is very well protected. If price will cut ema50 like butter there is a big posiibility to break ema200 without consolidation.(SL effect) if this happens = freefall to 1.28 Notice the oil dropped today 5%(still dropping 5.76% atm) All depend on how many ppl must be f&amp;%^ed up to satisfy masters.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
First sign of reversal came out. Weekly hammer should start nice rally next 2 weeks then we will see monthly hammer then qurterly !!!. Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Please have a look at these charts. Something 4 our retirement.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
EMA200 broken, momentum found resistance at ema20, stoch in bear zone wave 3 in progress patience is everything

--- 帖子 #684 ---
USD index shows(finally) good reversal formation with confluence of this system. As u can see last wave down was without momentum so bullish divergence still in play.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Finally we gather momentum also stoch ema20 provide good resistance now is time to break daily ema50 and enter bear zone wheres med-term trend change confirmation area. Hopefully this time i can hold my position till parity or even below. This week i will be know because monthly candle gonna close. cheers and goodluck.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
better outlook with momentum

--- 帖子 #687 ---
kindly attach the template for the above chart.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi check this one u can remove envelope indicator if u like but just use it for awhile ONLY on m15 TF and u wont regret. Cheers and happy pippin

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I dont know if someone want to read this but who cares. i write this to get proof for anticipation of my system correctnes or lack of it. Basic question is "if this system is strong enough to predict fundamental issue or in other words if fundumental is run by technical or technical run by fundamental, Its remind me egg and chicken dispute. I am going to make some prediction in coming weeks according only to system not involving my beliefs. Lets have look on fiber, cable, beast and imho most difficult pair to trade which is sushi. C'mon.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Monthly rejections rules to be valid always have to occure near emas. Weekly When ema 14 just touched ema50 expect retest of ema50 by price, check on smaller TF if u dont believe me. Daily ema50 rules, bull zone bear zone rules quite simple proves.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
daily shows everything u need : do not try to pickup when stoch is in daily bear zone. Weekly shows nothing because i have no idea which TL is valid for institutionals. Monthly This is amazing and might be prove for rule "when faster ema touch slower ema expect retest of lower ema(vide fiber post above). In this case ofc price must be lower to meet condition of rule.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
According to previous posts i just limit myself to post charts with description everything else is written between bars or candles

--- 帖子 #693 ---
And last but most important is relation between those two low rates CBs We have almost done. Forget about JPY for a long time. Monthly chart is enough. Any comments are welcomed.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
This one has been my favourite lately, safe buy according to SNB this time with my beliefs...

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Here i was totally wrong but ... Do u know what i mean.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
like i said was wrong many times.. start buying eurcad, u won't regret it

--- 帖子 #697 ---
i dont know why maybe olimpique maybe immigrants maybe something else.. dont care, anything below 30 should be bought, ETA is 5-10 years

--- 帖子 #698 ---
six years bull zone do i need say more if u want to get rich just imagine, remember my timing is so bad, do not engage all of ur money at once !!!!!!!! no quick money amateurs are welcomed here, patience Gl that was all.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
oh and here is great setup as well, valid as long as price is below 1.70

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Perhaps soon aussie gonna fall along with gold. Worth a try, completely oversold on weekly daily and even h4

--- 帖子 #701 ---
momentum still above ema100 on monthly TF target still reachable

--- 帖子 #702 ---
SMA100(current value 0.9072) retest if holds bigger impulsive wave toward 0.81-0.82 area is expected in the first place, Next possible extension to LT and 261.8% target which would have been 61.8% retracement of whole wave. Gold price is crucial here i make some analysis later.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Gold vs USD is in rather correction move than impulsive one. Retest of 1000$/oz is likely scenario. Too early to say something more here, stoch still in bear zone so long from this level is risky imho. On mothly TF uptrend is remaining very strong but i see first sign of overbought market. Very important is also gold price in EUR which makes record high at 830€/oz pas week. However this does not mean it could not goes higher in long term scope.Actually i think gold might hit 1600$/oz(this is 268.1% FE projection on monthly chart) before really big correction might occur if any... I do not recommend to sell gold because its highly risky counter trend game.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I am taking another shot here , Good setup double top on bearish div with retest of bull zone border. Also near 161.8% FE target.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Sorry guys... My mind is strongly bullish on yen and bearish on pound but i cannot ignore a few things. - gj tanked from 163 to 135 but VIX still near 20 ! - gj tanked, stocks did not (thats why VIX is at 20) - weekly bullish divergence on gbp/chf and gbp/jpy - gj and gc hit 61.8% fibo retracement - new fiscal year and government in Japan (this might change monetary policy in 180 degree) - possible SNB intervention - they dont want strong CHF i switched all my open trades to gbpchf as the best choice for me out there according to these all things. i will catch gj later, currently i am not convinced enough that is a bottom. Charts below showing bullish divergences, if these divs would played out then monthly stoch's escape from bear zone occur in both cases. Have a nice rest of anything u like This was my last prediction on this board, last advices : if u are daytrader/scalper : use even half margin but SL set to 3% max : after 5 min set SL to BE or close trade : TP 6%-12% or 5 min (intraday pivots S/R) : avoid news trade - it is gambling if u are long term trader : always follow weekly/daily trend never against : add positions on retracement(retest of broken support/res) near emas 14/50/200 preferably or fibs 61.8 76.4 :never catch botttom/top in most cases there is a retest (double top/bottom) :TP partial on 1.61% fibo or emas of bigger TF if exist. : when adding position to existing one (scaling) never add bigger position than the first one unless u use scalp rules (5 min then BE) : be aware of stock market sentiment and join to carry trade, in carry trade there are whole our money from taxes, retirement funds and so on join to them. hedge trader is similar to longterm trader but : never invest more than 0,01% for single position (calculate proper value to avoid margin call, u have to hadle 1000-2000 pips even in both sides, so after 2000 pips drawdown u are still able to buy/sell for same amount ) : close position only if u really need money or if u identify range : earn with carry traders : never use SL - hedge GL &amp; GT

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Fiber first check my last charts on previous page for review. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=690 Well i am very glad that movement in 99% was predicted by system. Only mistake was that "I saw" a little bit correction first in February - actualy it was a little retrace but flat. I can live with that

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Cable no comment please just check charts http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=691

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Is this system trade able on Hour and 15min, or have you have u traded it at these TFs.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Here i am not sure at the moment what will be next, I still see some downward movement in UJ which drags GJ na GC down but this is my guess not system involved. Uj might start bull run now or hit double bottom, too early to say that thats why i am on sideline right now for these pairs. I will let u know when picture will be brighter with global economy and equities.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Well, here i cannot defend myself it was pure CB speculation to drive EUR down then buy at discount. After all prediction was against basic rules there was no bullish div even on daily TF And the second rule : dont go long when stoch is flat in bear zone... and worth to note dont trust SNB Lesson learned i hope

--- 帖子 #711 ---
As espexted more or less now at support let see how strong it is On monthly TF there is still NO bear div.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
similar story to both ec here full bear control it's been since november 2009... no comment please i will be more careful nex time. If EU zone will recover fromthis PIGS issue the health range for both economies is 1.54-1.74 and this should be equilibruim point in following months. Aussie hit target after test of highs again which was possible after SMA100 breaks(see in previous post) Anyway on daily there is support and retrace due, on weekly we need one more confirmation of bearishnes.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Is this system trade able on Hour and 15min, or have you have u traded it at these TFs.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
i saw ur post earlier relax mate. It could be apllied on lower TF just look for it in this thread. I presented many trades during 2008.Everything u asked is here. This system requires very good trading knowledge in overal It is not designed for beginners and also not designed fot daytrading. This system predicts reversal and trend continuation mainly on bigger TF and for your safety i prefer to remain like this

--- 帖子 #715 ---
ukcool here is good setup for euraud clear bearish divergence but if u want to take short first wait for aussie data and cash rate.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
hi 5ysfx interesting system u have.... i dont know how i missed it earler i will go thro. the thread from page 1.. keep the good work going jay

--- 帖子 #717 ---
5y, thanks for sharing the most encouraging system. and also to arezeb for the mt4 stuff. I am testing on demo account and very encoouraging.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
@jaydc and unclek6 Thanks guys i appreciated a lot. Later i will attach alternative version of the template, it appears like charts above. I think EMA50 and EMA200(EMA50 on higher TF) is the must and should be enough to draw correct support/resistance zones. BTW aussie is doing nicely so far, 200 pips left to first major resistance.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
First post was updated, if someone is interested is in there. Final version of template for MT4 has been attached. GL

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Ok buddy, let see what it does on the 15m.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
U have to bear in mind above m15 is m30 h1 h4 d1 w m which have greatest influence than m15. divergence on m15 is good for 50-100 pips profit depends on pair but still ONE divergence on m15 WILL NOT change daily trend. So if u see that daily is about to leave bull/bear zone h4 MUST support this view then h1 then m30 or m15. Simple clockwork or step by step base on S/R This system only can show u what position is against major trend and when trend is about to end which doesn not mean the price may not run another a few hundreds pips before divergence will play out.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Can you give a little more explanation on your trigger. Plus on the chart what you see as trend.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Well and here u need knowledge about candlestick patterns also eliot waves theory and of course fundamental analysis. I guess u need a realtime proofs, it is not so simple. Trigger might me even m5 stoch rejection but if its fails u need to close trade immediately on BE in most cases. Trigger might be big S/R zone with candle shadows(wicks) which show us pressure to one currency. S/R is often based on fibo extension - see first post. To put it straight when u see trend fading(divergence) when price approches strong S/R u have big odds for bounce off that level. However S/R might be tested many times so there is no point to hurry - i prefer double top patterns or multimple ones. There are also undocumented rules like crossiing of emas or three retrace(three broken bottoms) in trend before 61.8/76.4 retrace. This system is not simple cross something then buy/sell and never will be.

And here it is m15 signal generates 400 pips so far It does not happen everytime unless u know how to use this system this time it was last m15 stoch cycle- once i tried to count how many m15 cycles must be done before h1 will reverse - hard thing to do for me. Long term view is still bullish huge accumulation on 1.40-1.43 levels See monthly chart.

If someone bought aud/usd aud/jpy seems good thing to keep it as long term carry trade investment. Have a look at silver daily, momentum fading which means there is no selling pressure anymore. Rejection of bear zone is highly likely. GL to all.

Big test this week for USD - 0.90-0.92 is the sell level for big boys if we see more risk aversion on stock markets then target for short should be arround 0.7 minimum. If we see more risk appetite(more likely for now) then north direction will be open to test all time highs and even beyond. but fist lets wait and see reaction at 90's zone.

Big loser ? Bullish divergence on the making but still it needs to dive below 1.35 to be valid as LONG signal. The major long term trend is bearish and still in tact.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Upward channel is valid untill break of lower TL - imho less likely. We can see triangle in play- mostly is the sign of accumulation of primary currency in this case USD. Long term target 1.3 minimum as long as stays above parity.

Euro strength or NZD weakness ? bullish div on weekly but long is not safe just yet unles u can manage 1000pips DD h4 in downtrend cycle NU at UTL of flag. daily stoch ready to reverse.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Almost done. weekly close above ema50 and bull run should start. I am looking for long near parity, 1.025 will be my first long order.

Time to exit aussie longs it was good 400 pips, rejection played out nicely on daily we have no demand candle so called spinning top. bearish div on h3 TF

--- 帖子 #732 ---
also clear bearish div just below daily ema200! whole bear flag is about to collapse and clear all longs.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
hmmm

Didnt work out with cable but... cj short is "high probability" trade unless she clear 86.30 All conditions have met although decision is not in our hands. We need final push below 80 psychological level. Target must be hit this year otherwise prediction is wrong. GL to all.

Game over for kiwi weekly bearish div on the play.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Here i have to clear something. Weekly divergence could take some time to play hard way, now is only matter of when not if. weekly candle is slightly bullish doji on ema50 support - Strategy is simply follow breakout of doji range. or just wait for UTL of triangle to short but only when price will stall. price need to break ema50 to confirm bear div on weekly.. GL

nothing new yet compared to this http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=693 though maybe lower all time low hard to bet for bottom but we are getting "closer". and even tiny sign of significant JPY distribution.

aussie seems confirmed bearish view, retracement wave hit my target. works like a charm this time http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=712 now we have double top seems perfect time for 2000 pps down i think, unless she breaks higher. note how rejection worked out very well on daily - marked in red circle.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
aussie is moving higher - setup postponed potential targets .94 then .98 AUD is incredible strong. I am watching also AUD/CAD slowly approaches parity level too. 400 pips to go...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
NZD is ready for sell off EUR/NZD Weekly bullish divergence near TL, bounce off of that TL is every 175 pips so according to this info i believe next boune off is planned somewhere below 17400 to 17330. Oanda 's last avg price is 17408 thus i expect reversal on Asia session today. NZD/USD Same story if asia will dump kiwi today this gonna be last high this year if not then we have to take patience pills .

If this chart represent correct economic cycles between these two countries. Conclusion is only one AUD will sink more than NZD. montly bearish divergence with retest of bull zone area. Nothing certain though but great odds for bear camp if UTL holds this time and these two fake breakout will be confirmed.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Long time no post here but here we got nice setup again for all greenback pairs. 2008 Deja vu on aussie and massive bullish div on dx future-- monthly chart they are speaking for themselves. What can we notice these days is someone starts to buy usd/jpy on other majors cost, thats why i stoped to trade jpy crosses on long term basis. This correlation has been started since October. Basically after every dip on uj we can see drop of eu for instance http://stooq.pl/q/?s=jpyusd&amp;d=201011...+gbpusd+audusd Someone is buying usd very slow and steady. Till next time, trade well.

good stuff man. ur thread is one i keep checkin and learning from

--- 帖子 #226 ---
We are approaching major decision point which is small body candle of last year 1.41-143 open/close zone. From system point of view monthly stoch had rejected big downtrend earlier this year(expected bounce off of monthly ema200) Weekly is ready for very bullish mode but it need to clear out the 1.41-1.45 area. And it might be hard because daily does not support this view with current bearish divergence flag/triangle/pennant forming. h4 is bullish for this week. charts below. Note that : AUD is or has been above parity vs CAD,USD,CHF. EUR/NZD EUR/AUD possible double bottom pattern. EUR/GBP 5th wave up (above parity) is missing. What do we know for sure ? Constantly growing economy is a MYTH because of limited resources on the planet. Stocks are rising only because population is rising. Population is rising because energy consumption growth. so far only real efficient energy is ...oil. Coal, natural gas and green and atom energy is not enough to cover current needs and sustain life as we do know now. U dont have to be like Michel de Nostredame to see where all FIAT money and equities are going ultimately so does the population of this planet. I want to believe that soon we will discover new highly efficient energy source or else... GL Thank you for encouraging words, appreciated. I am glad that someone finds this one person talk useful

Greetings everyone It is really good to recall your own thoughts after 5 years. I need to do this so i will make some long term predictions based on stoch, mom and MAs to be complaint with thread. As long red TL is kept on 4H chart i am going long. PS this is only possible road map it will depends on worldwide events how things resolve. I just keep my chronicle on

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Still have this idea of reverting USD trend back, dont know for how long and when exactly but it is going sooner than later. Based on my previous predictions (i could be wrong 1 year but long term targets mostly were met ) big USD sell off coming that is visible according to system. No political talk behind needed PS Always be careful of whipsaws (could be even 1000pips like history of this thread proves but i am getting better with timing nowadays so... ) GL &amp; GT all.
