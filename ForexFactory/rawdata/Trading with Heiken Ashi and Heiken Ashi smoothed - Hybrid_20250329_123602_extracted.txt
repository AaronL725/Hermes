I have been recently experimenting with a new system I "developed" and have backtested and has been working very well. What will we be using? Heiken Ashi default indicator and also Heiken Ashi smoothed indicator. Entry rule; 1) Trade only in the direction of HA Smooth (Blue - long, Red - short) 2) Entry is when HA default closes 1 bar below or above the HA smooth. 3) Exit is when HA default closes 1 bar in the opposite colour. 4) SL - 100 pips emergency stop - can be adjusted for different time frames. From what I have seen, this strategy is a pip maker on 15M, 30M, 1H and 4H timeframes. Please feel free to test and comment. If any EA coders come cross this thread - please do shoot me an email or private message as I am seriously searching for someone to code this into an EA - to kill the emotional torture of this system even though it is highly lucrative! Thanks! Please rate this thread if you like what you see - thank you fellow traders!

PLease post your vesrion of the HA smoothed. Thank you

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Here you go! Feel free to back test or forward test Happy pippin!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Refer to the attachments above "hedayat" is my other account which I was logged into. Sorry!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
here's a screenshot. combined with the TDI as confirmation and also as an exit indicator, your system looks very powerful. my chart has the smoothed as the green/salmon combo, and the default is the red/blue. the yellow line is a 5sma shifted 2

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Haha I use TDI too! But still experimenting with TDI as I was using TMS for a long time but this 1 gives less false signals! Well the markets open soon and my live account tests begins soon!

Anyhow, there are 32 traders viewing this fresh thread now - great job to myself lol! Just wanted to highlight an issue that I found with the system and if any kind reader could help me with; The issue is simply, as with any HA method, the chops. Anyone trying this method on visual backtest would have noticed that the chops could kill profits. Is there any MA or other indicator that could filter the chops? Looking forward to your replies guys - thanks in advance and for reading!

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hedayat SM, it is a very interesting and a very unusual idea, at least I never heard of anything like this before. About the chops: maybe the better way is not to add another indicator, but pay more attention to HA itself? I mean something like this: if the closed HA candle in question is more than 10 (or 12 or 15, you need to backtest) pips - than it is a valid entry, otherwise it is just a "noise". As far as I remember, somebody proposed this method in the TMS thread.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thank you for your valuable advise buddy. I will look into that - the 10pips idea seem viable but of course more pips should be used for bigger TFs I guess. Will backtest and forward test incorporating this idea. Oh it was suggested? I missed it. Which post number? What was the outcome of the suggestion buddy? Would like to know and learn from it! Thanks once again for the replies all

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hedayat SM, unfortunately I don't remember the post number, I tried to find it before writing my post but couldn't find it so far. All I remember is: somebody suggested it in the TMS thread either in May or in June, I don't even remember exactly how many pips he suggested, but the guy had some good statistics and he suggested different figures for H-1 and for H-4. Unfortunately nobody supported him... If I find this post, I'll let you know in this thread.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Alright buddy thanks for all the effort. Quick question, do you find this system viable - given you're an experienced member in FF? Also, would you be forward testing (live/demo?) this system? (More tests - more reliability) Thanks buddy!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hedayat SM, good news: I found these two TMS posts I was talking about : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...04#post4635104 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...67#post4635167 The guy was talking about the Synergy_APB candles, but as far as I understand, there is a very little difference between Synergy_APB and the original HA. I think your system looks very promising. I can't start testing it right now live (I trade live two different systems and sometimes trade TMS too), but I'll probably create a small demo account and give it a try next week.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Once again thanks for the effort buddy - will look at the two posts. Also, for the vote of confidence on the system - thanks! I hope you will give it a test and also post back the results, be it negative or positive I will start live testing tomorrow during the london rush hour as well as NY Keep the pips falling! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
People testing this system, please post your results and also note which TF this system works best in in your own opinion! Thanks a million!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Buddy, please explain more details on entry rule.. thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hey buddy, As for entry, I would go only in the direction of HA smooth. Let say HA smooth is red, and HA default crosses down to become red also, I would take a short order. I will exit on the next opposite colored candle to appear on the default HA. Below I have attached a pic for reference on a few possible trades. Arrow down - short order entry Arrow up - close out short order Cross - bad signal and order not taken

--- 帖子 #18 ---
How did you know that the cross was a bad trade and didnt take it ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Very good and valid question - respect that. Ok how would I classify it as a bad trade? Altho many trades do bounce back even if they look good, when I see a closed candle but closed in such a way that it forms a massive doji, I would consider it a weak signal as indecision is there and would probably be very risky. What do you think about that idea? Please do share your ideas. This way we could minimize losses

--- 帖子 #20 ---
fair enough...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Tried out the system on 2 pairs today with H4 - got out too early as TP was hit. Wanted to trail TP and SL but went out and got back home to see both TPs hit - total about 100 pips and slightly more. Will be testing more and posting back. Will look forward to your posts. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Nice trend following idea, could make some money

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks for the vote of confidence buddy!

Played around with this today as I always liked Heiken Ashi Using TMS-Osc Histogram, 5 EMA (shifted 2, typical price), 5 LMA (0 shift, linear weighted), and the Synergy MTF indicator for confirmation. Entry: 1) Smoothed &gt; Regular (for long), Smoothed &lt; Regular (short) 2) 5 EMA &gt; 5 LMA (for long), 5 EMA &lt; 5LMA (for short) 3) TMS-Osc Histogram = green (for long), TMS-Osc Histogram = red (for short) 4) Synergy MTF has to show uptrends/downtrends down to 15min Exit: 1) Stop loss or trailing stop gets hit (depends on time frame) 2) TMS-Osc Histogram turns red/green 3) MAs cross in opposite direction 4) Synergy MTF turns the other way for all timeframes leading up to the one you're trading. Did some visual backtesting only so far, but results look promising. Using those indicators for confirmation helps in dodging quite a few fake breakouts. Jumping into a trend a bit late isn't horrible too, as the indicators provide for a decent warning once things go "south". This thing seems to be working better for 1hr+ time frames though as you end up with too many unnecessary losing/BE trades if you go lower. I can upload indicators/template if anyone's interested. It would obviously rock if someone created an EA for this setup...not sure how viable this is though. If possible, it would be cool to be able to change entry/exit requirements by excluding some indicators for the decision process whenever the situation calls for it. EDIT: Also, stay away from ranging markets with a tight range...you'll get burned badly

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hey buddy sorry for the late reply. Well, however you modify your entry rules, as long as it drops pips on ur head - I'm glad! Just make sure the pips ain't that heavy! LoL! I was backtesting the system on all time frames..I found H4 to be the best though - what are your thoughts? H1 - sure you can take pips in and out of short moves but its just too tedious and taxxing on the emotions man! Haha about the EA - tell me about it, I have been begging all around for a coder to code this baby - sure I will post it if I get a good one - afterall caring is sharing! About the templates, please do post the templates as I am sure many would find it useful. Could you also help me post a default template of my original creation? Thanks. I was looking for someone to code a simple EA based on my simple idea of the two HAs to cross - very simple coding as I have studied VB before but I don't know how to handle MQL - neither do I remember my VB stuff anymore. So yea..keep the posts and backtests results coming. P.S: If you can catch an entire H4 move without your emotions hitting ur head - you can well over catch a few hundred pips on each swing - precisely why I am searching for an EA for this! Cheerz buddy! P.P.S: Could you also post a chart with all your indis and entry/exit rules highlighted?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I agree, 4hr seems to work best...but anything longer will do just fine. You could probably make it work at lower timeframes, but I agree, it will be mentally taxing as a ton of trades will hit breakeven or your stop loss because of fake breakouts. My template's attached: 1) Synergy MTF: Arrows show strong movement, blue or red square means momentum is slowing 2) TMS-Osc Histogram 3 timeframes: Love this one. A good entry is when all 3 line up either red or green. To the 4hr TF, I show 1hr/4hr/1d timeframes...higher aren't necessary as they are already part of my weekly base analysis. 3) Spread: Self explanatory...shows the spread in points (!!!) and not pips. 4) Bid/ask: Shows the bid/ask price Still optimizing my entry/exits, will take me until the end of the week as I have a busy fulltime job (real estate). Will post a pic of my screen with entries/exists indicated once I'm done backtesting a bit more. By the way, to figure out and confirm support/resistance levels I use Ichimoku...which is my main position trading system.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks for the reply buddy. Nice effort going on there - take it as a testimonial to the potential of this system - altho more testing is essential. As for Ichimoku - damn I have always found it so difficult to understand that messy baby - altho I have heard much good reviews about it being a good "leading" indicator. Sure mate about the pics, you could post one when ur free - together with your P/L if you wouldn't mind Take care and cheerz!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Interesting idea, subscribing

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks for the vote of confidence buddy - please feel free to test out the system and share the results

Ok, below's a pic of the daily chart for USDCAD. Trading starts at 13 July 2011 until today...and it turns out one trade went against me, and losses could have been minimized with a good stop loss. I picked a "bad" stop loss of 85 pips, and still ended up with 1,338 pips for the period. Not bad given it's low-stress daily chart trading, and only 1 pair http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/Smoo...AD%20Daily.jpg Entry 1: MA cross, TMS Histogram lines up on all timeframes, price action would have been trending down on Synergy, HA &lt; Smooth HA Exit 1: You could have picked your exit like me when the TMA Histogram went green on all timeframes, could have waited for the MA cross, could have waited until HA &gt; Smooth HA. The difference in pips lost isn't massive. Entry 2: HA &lt; Smooth HA, LMA &gt; EMA, TMA Histogram lines up green Exit 2: TMA Histogram lines up red, or you could have waited for the MA cross or the HA cross Entry 3: TMA Histogram lines up red, LMA &lt; EMA, Smooth HA &gt; HA Exit 3: TMA Histogram lines up, MA cross, Smooth HA &lt;= HA Entry 4: TMA Histogram lines up, MA cross, Smooth HA &lt;= HA Exit 4: TMA Histogram lines up, MA cross (close = flat...you could wait for the full cross) Entry 5: HA &gt; Smooth HA, TMA histogram lines up, LMA &lt; EMA Exit 5: Here we get stopped out...exit depends on stop loss settings (depends on TF and ATR) Entry 6: TMA Histogram lines up, HA &gt; Smooth HA, LMA &gt; EMA Exit 6: TMA Histogram lines up, MA cross imminent (hook) Entry 7: TMA Histogram lines up, EMA &gt; LMA, Smooth HA &gt; HA Exit 7: Still running I'm pretty confident on entries, but still working on my exit strategy...needs further testing. Also playing with stop loss settings, but overall this strategy seems to have a high winning % at higher timeframes. It doesn't take long to check whether or not a currency is worth of a trade once you got the indicators set up...so I guess it's best to focus on the daily (or 4hr) and trade a ton of different currencies. The difficulty will be in setting decent "emergency" stop loss levels and not to over trade. Skimming through tons of currencies should give you plenty of opportunities and prevent you from spazzing out though Also, as you might have noticed, I'm using quite a few other indicators for confirmation. I just don't feel too comfortable using just HA. Still working on the combination of entry/exit signals...maybe I enter/exit if 2 out of 4 (HA, MA, TMA Histogram, Price Action) indicators match up, maybe 3 out of 4, maybe 4 out of 4. Will have to run some tests Something I haven't shown is the support/resistance analysis that goes along with trades...but like I said, I'm using Ichimoku for that and don't wanna derail the thread. EDIT: Just fyi, USDCHF is lining up for a nice short with this system, and all signs point down based on Ichimoku too.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Quickly checked a few more currencies: They all seem to offer around 2 trades per month on average if you stick with strict rules...but winning % is consistently high. So far they all seem to net around 150-200pips per trade. Not a ton of trades, but you can just browse currencies and will find more than enough per month. I'm actually tempted to not run a fix stop loss and just use reverse signals to bail out. Maybe an emergency stop loss in case I'm stranded on an island without Internet.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Nice going buddy! I see a whole lot of effort on that post! The modified system is looking sweet I'd say. However, did notice that some main rules of the original system was tweaked with - eg exit on 1st candle closing in opposite color. Why so buddy? Does it make a significant difference? Could it be more hurtful if held onto a trade with a candle going against you? And of course haha there are more than enough pips in any one chart for literally no work using the daily tf I'd say! Once an EA is successfully coded for this, its going to be travelling around the world holidaying only! lol! I think that could be done even with the daily TF with a laptop haha! Also, I was thinking, would H4 possibly give us better pip results in the end of the test period? Cause definitely we will get earlier exits and earlier entries wouldn't we? Hmm still contemplating which TF to test this baby with on live trading. At the moment, I am testing on H4 and its going well (maybe too early to tell) haha! But I see the light at the end of the tunnel! Hopefully that ain't no train! Thanks for your effort buddy, keep the healthy posts coming and would love to see your foreward test results too (I don't expect that soon since this is a system for higher TFs generally) lol! Cheerz buddy!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Having an ideal emergency stop would be good to avoid high risk news events like intervention or some other crap these central banks come out with! Other than that, my original idea was to have a reverse signal stop too - not exactly reverse signal though but reverse closed HA candle colour. Hey buddy, one more thing, the multi time frame tool isn't working as how it's seen in your picture attachment on my platform - am I missing something? Loaded everything thru the template you attached and still nothing - just see all red arrows pointing down but no small coloured squares - do I need to have an email and login password - cause I see those in the indicator settings? Please do advise...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello 4exNinja, Thanks for sharing your trading methodology and indicator (and not forgetting Hedayat for starting this thread). I would defintely test this out as it aligns with my objective to trade longer time frame. Before that, I do have two questions below: a) Synergy MTF - I loaded the indicator and template but my chart only shows all down red arrow for every timeframe. I don't see red/blue square or green up arrow. I loaded it on all pairs and seeing the same problem. b) TMS-Osc MTF Histo - can you please share this indicator. I have the non-MTF version. Thanks and appreciate your assistance.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
No problem buddy - sharing our strategies put our odds in winning better. Anyhow, the problem you mentioned is experienced by me as well! Lol tough luck huh! I hope 4exninja would shed light on this. Thanks for the reply buddy! Keep the results pouring in!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
can you please re post your template etc the one you posted does not have the tms osc hist know what you mean about real estate having done it for many years LOL

--- 帖子 #37 ---
As a general information: the book of the Heikin-Ashi inventor has just been released. - In his free newsletter you can see that he also uses the Ichimoku indicator. - For his haDelta indicator I have written two indicators: one as an oscillator, the other as arrow signals. Because the author does not publish the exact formula, I've programmed quite a similar indicator. A lot of fun.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
IMPRESSIVE. Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Many thanks to all of you! I'm trading Gold (physical) and I need big TF like H4 to take profit (due to the big diff between bid/ask, say, about $5-$10/oz). TA is new to me. I went wrong way because I didn't know about technical analysis. Last week, I used HA and HA smoothed. But because I only pay attention to HA smoothed, so I was late to make an entry. I'll test your system and provide feedback soon. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Heh, guess I'm not the only one using Ichimoku to back up those HA candles Seems to be a really nice combo. HA and the other indicators are lagging, while Ichimoku is forward looking and showing support/resistance levels. Won't be able to re-upload my template until later tonight or tomorrow I'm afraid, too busy at work. But if got them all from this forum, so just do a search if you're impatient

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Nice work guys - including all other senior members giving suggestions of HA and ichimoku - really looking nice there However, for the sake of this thread and it's rules, could we try to stick to the discussion of the main rules? - This is so cause I wanted to really keep it very simple and almost like a no brainer - you know like fat and lazy rich man like of system Appreciate all your efforts to improve the ideas stated here but yeap for the sake of the thread, could we test out the rules as per stated on post #1? Thanks guys! Looking forward to seeing results! P.S Guys teach me about ichimoku! Lol and nice job with that HA informational "booklet" buddy!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
ty for posting i will look at it later on tonight

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I think the original rules are good, but because of the nature of HA candles, I don't think it's all that great using it without "backup" indicators. They just serve as confirmation, and don't take long to check out. Adding Ichimoku helps in identifying support/resistance which could help immensely in ignoring fake breakouts. Here's a great link explaining the system in a concise way: LINK Having said that, I don't wanna derail the thread, so if you want to stick to the base rules, I respect that. I just think that adding the rest will greatly improve your system. The Chikou Span for example tells you at one glance whether the momentum points up or down over a certain period. Only takes 2sec to glance at it @SwingMan: The graphs you posted are from 21st October...I wouldn't hold my breath for a Euro rally right now. The world will wake up over the coming days, and realize that Merkozy's plan to solve the leverage issue is...wait for it...waaaaaaaait for it...MORE LEVERAGE. Anyone with a brain can see that medium/long term, this won't go well. If they don't achieve a resolution this week, the Euro will tank, and if they do, it'll result in a short term rally followed by a collapse. All those countries needing financial bailouts aren't sticking with the austerity measures, and that includes Italy, which is a lot worse than Greece given the size of its economy.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I'm trying to follow Hedayat's line of reasoning...I want to know what he is trying to teach. Instead of jumping in with a different system, why not start your own thread? Post your comment similar to the following: "I have a slight twist to Hedayat's system and if you'd like to see it, go to [link]." That's only being polite and respectful to Heydayat.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yea buddy agree with you on the fakeouts needing to be filtered. I appreciate the idea. Especially so since scanning the backtests, I have spotted some really bad fakeouts which may mint a few pips by the time the candle colour changes but not worth the time we would be holding onto the trade for. My real problem is not really with entries though..the exits need to be toyed with very much. Could you explain, as per your previous post with a picture, how exactly and concretely you based your entries and exits on and the theory behind it? I am seeking a solid exit point at the moment on D1 chart though. Thanks once again buddy for the efforts.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hey buddy, thanks for the support buddy. I am actually more or less fine with refining entries and exits on my idea - would be worth a few hundred pips on exits each time. You have any ideas on those, please shoot it on this thread would love to see it. After all, we are seeking healthy conversations! Have fun buddy!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hey buddy, could you explain a little on how the ha delta and ha arrows work? If it could give us better entries and exits, we could incorporate that into our method Thanks for the indis buddy have loaded them up but unsure on usage though haha

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Just to be clear, I am NOT dissing the system or trying to derail the thread...so if Hey wants to stick to the original rules so will I.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
The ichimoku looks interesting..hmm support resistance sure would be helpful! Lol you guys changed my name totally!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Ups, sorry for that, at work and alt-tabbing between this and work. Feel free to butcher my name too Also, keep in mind that the HA candle guru uses other indicators as backup too...just a thought. I do agree that we should keep it as simple as possible though. Got a busy week, but I'll test it with different combinations of indicators (TMA-Osc Histogram, PA MTF Synergy, Ichimoku, MAs) and see which one seems to work best. Read the Ichi link I posted if you're interested, it's a good, often underused system...sometimes it's scary how accurately it predicts support/resistance.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hey buddy no problem man. Please take your time to respond - work is work and you may have a family to feed unlike me. As for Ichimoku - wow what a powerful system - I read about it and finally understand the cloud better now - dynamic S/R - coolness! As for timeframes, quick question, do you think it would have a better reward return for risk taken in H4? I did massive backtesting (visual) and see that H4 mints more pips (for more work) than D1. Besides, once we get an exit signal in D1, we often have to sacrifice 150-400 pips only for that confirmation candle - unlike H4! PIPs are pips man - we are all begging all around for them. Please look through (all viewers) and post your comments on time frames and other ways to improve the system without making it too complicated or changing rules too much. Thanks for the effort buddy - appreciate you doing all this amidst your work obligations! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
"haDelta" is in principle the candle body (I have taken an SMA (3)). It can be then smoothed with other two SMAs(3). The intersection of the lines indicate in general trend changes, and is an early indicator for stronger trends. (More about is to read in Chapter 4 of the book.) I can not give many explanations because the indicator is only three days old . I use the Arrows Indicator because the visualisation of the line crosses is better as to check this in the oscillator.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Just a warning! The indicators hase a little bug and dont refresh ... I fix it in the next time.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Nice going buddy! Will check the indis out in details - if it cn show trend strength - why not huh? Anyhow, you do MQL coding? LoL! You know where I am going with this!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi all Ihave attached a screen of ausd usd this template seems to work this shows gain of 166 pips

--- 帖子 #56 ---
That shows it a bit better first time I have posted a chart LOL

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I guess with the modified rules we are seeing more late entries with early exits? Frankly, earning that bits of pips for me on the daily chart does not look so good. I prefer H4 charts - look at the beauty if you ride the H4 candles all the way until they are exhausted - pretty impressive on H4 seriously. I really liked the idea of keeping it simple and entering on simple rules and exiting on simple rules - besides it does mint more pips! Lol.. Thanks for the post buddy! Keep the forward tests coming!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Welcome buddy - the XAUUSD chart is looking sweet too! You should test the system on demo though to be comfortable! Enjoy your gains!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Welcome buddy. Post back your results and comments.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hey everyone, I have used the heiken ashi before, glad to see I am not the only one. Cannot wait to see how this thread develops. I am taking it easy with trades this week, since the euro is just a shit show right now. But will be running this on demo to see how it works.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi all, Yesterday I missed a LONG entry as I couldn't measure the strength of the signal. (Price from 1650 up tp 1710 =&gt; 6000 pips!). The EMA was going to cross-over but it then changed their direction. So late! If I hold long from the beginning of HA-smoothed, it's ok. But if I was late, how dare I enter the market at the middle of the trend? I think we should find a complement to measure the strength. It could be Ichimoku or candle pattern? http://ne2.upanh.com/b5.s3.d2/c6076b...222.gold26.png

Hi Stumpy1! Nice work.. Where can I get the indies for a template such as yours? I would love to experiment with it. It seems to pull off some nice trades there. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hey Stumpy, Nice looking charts - could you post template and indys? Thanks in advance !

--- 帖子 #64 ---
The template and ind are in post 26 just add the one I have attached You will have to edit tyhe time frames in the indicater I have added

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hahaha, didn't think someone would like my Rastafarian-Jamaican coloring

--- 帖子 #66 ---
WORKS FOR ME LOL how do you get the synergy MTF to work?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Sure buddy have the results poured in! Today this boy made ma so far about 75 pips on 2 trades still running as exit is not signalled..will see what he does next!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I'm up around 85pips on USDCHF short using the system, so far so good Not sure how I got Synergy to work, or where I got it from...but I have the full version and it seems to work fine on my computer.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Haha we love it buddy giving the overview of the other TFs. However, I did notice that some timeframes have black (missing) boxes - how could we resolve that issue? Thanks buddy once again!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Nice going buddy..I'm on that trade too but entered late last night - was +47 awhile ago now its +25 hmm..will see hw it goes...waiting for the right exit!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Repipula Hi, Could you please post your template? BtW, Thanks for the promising system Hedayat.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
No problem buddy - sharing is healthy Wish all of us all the best..today has been so quiet due to EU summit - holding my positions without much moves for long now haha!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Guys, from monday onwards (this week is so rocky) I will be officially testing certain pairs - and wish you would follow to test as well alongside me and give me headsup if I missed any signals. The pairs are; USDCHF, GBPPUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, GBPAUD. Please review and comment on the above - also remind me of the correlations if they exist. Thank you for your time for reading this thread!! P.S GU, EU, UJ having some signals now - Not taking it live given EU summit but have drawn "entry" lines to see how they might fare - will update later.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi seniors, Am attempting this promising system and thanks for sharing. Just a question which has been asked but not answered (i think) : Why is the synergy MTF just showing red arrows pointing downwards instead of the blue and red squares posted in the charts in this thread?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
The poll results are interesting. I suppose those who agree that the system is viable and may work - we all got more or less the same reasons. It would be interesting to hear from those who think this system might not work. So those who vote "No" I humbly request you to tell us here openly why you said the system wont work - your efforts are all appreciated. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I'm still not sure why that is. I think you have to pay for the full version of Synergy, but I got it somewhere of the net a few months ago...worked fine from the start. I won't have time to look into it until the weekend I'm afraid, but will do so then. It works just fine on my computer, and it's a pretty cool way to figure out price action and momentum for different time frames. I will also start running this method on all majors and a few others I like (AUDNZD, etc) starting next Monday once I had more time to figure out what set of backup indicators I want to use with the smoothed HA candle system. Once we have finalized a good system, it would be cool to keep this thread running so people can share whenever they find a setup...I know I will. Having others agree/disagree with your proposed setups will be a good way to refine the system.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The previously mentioned appearing setups would not have yielded well - nice going EU Summit! Will have to wait till market settles down.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Good thinking buddy..I was thinking the same if people would share setups we could scrutinise the entries and make the system more refined!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks for the reply. From the looks of it, the synergy MTF is not an important indicator. Its only just a good-to-have indicator right?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I'm basically using it as confirmation and to time entries. For example, if I'm trading the 4hr time and want to go long, I won't enter if the lower timeframes all show a red arrow down. The TMS-Osc Histogram seems a lot more useful overall and offers further confirmation. The thing is, I like to have as much backup confirmation for my trades as possible.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Just curios what did you not like about the synergy system?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Mostly geared for &lt;1hr timeframes, and I have a fulltime job

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yup. I entered eur/aud trade on h4 but felt lacking when all i had to go on was the crossing of MA lines,HA and the TMS-Osc.

I got the indicators from compassfx.com for free so lets see how they work, I also attached a user guide that they included with the indicators.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Just reading thru the posts. looks interesting,as i also perfer trading 4h and above charts only. will load up the template and do some visual backtesting over the weekend. happy trading

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Like most threads, the original system changes, Which system will you be testing? Yours or others that were posted ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=106887 See this thread I have found the system to work but I only trade the daily time frame

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hey buddy - nice to see you guys are having a great conversation here but it is not exactly polite to be posting a well established system on a thread meant for another system. If you feel like you could improve my system by refining it with other methods - by all means - your suggestions will be viewed seriously. Otherwise, please go to the appropriate thread and post for that system. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
The original system buddy - yesterday took USDCAD - now running at +70. Will see how it goes and update.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Ok I have +85 pips on USDCAD H4 but now in a dilemma on where to close it! Damn my exit strategy is bad!! Exited USDCAD with +84 - will re-enter on H1 pullback.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Took EURUSD - LONG - H4 Took AUDUSD - LONG - H4

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Nice system, but i think it works better on some pairs than others. GBPCAD maybe one thats not good. Does range and has big candles that can take out SL only to move back...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
It helped me not to short XAU/USD while other indicators alert!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I will start to test this system on demo, too!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
looks promising!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Hedayat SM, thanks for sharing your system, can you pls post up the screen shot of the 2 trades (EU and AU) that you took recently? Thanks

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Sure buddy the screenshot is here. http://my.jetscreenshot.com/demo/201...nl0u-350kb.jpg http://my.jetscreenshot.com/demo/201...cjr2-301kb.jpg

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yeap with some pairs it works better but I guess for GBPCAD it works on H4 but make sure your money management is good to cover SLs.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
thanks a lot. In AU chart, u are using Ichimoku, but not in EU. Are you experimenting Ichimoku now? Coz it is not in your first post.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Closed out EU and AU for about 46+ on EU and +26 AU. I know I should have been patient but at the moment I am doing my important lab report for submission tomorrow and I can't concentrate with this trades on! Lol! I need discipline! Argh..anyhow won't be trading today will catch up on trades tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Yeap! Experimenting with Ichimoku but it is not affecting my trading decisions at the moment - just watching how the support and resistance lines are playing along. If I integrate it into my method, I will inform all here.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
jumped in and I am currently +100 Pips up on AU and EU!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Haha good going buddy! Don't make me jealous for stepping out early! Haha.. Rate the thread will you?! LoL!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I´ve already rated it

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hedayat, It was never my intention to move to another system, I actually was trying to add another indi to the chart, and kind of just noticed I didnt explain as well as I shouldve. I will post a more revised version later, I love the heiken indi and want to stick with it. Just looking at ways of improving it. Didn't mean any disrespect, not trying to advertise any other system here lol Gus

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Haha no problem buddy all is healthy I would love a better exit strategy myself becos exiting on a H4 reverse seems to cause too many pips to go bad. I would appreciate all help given. Thank you for the clarification and may we get close to that perfect system - not meaning 100% profitable though! Cheerz!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
did you tought to go on lower tf (mainly 1h if you trade 4h) for the exit?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I discussed same with the author of the system. Maybe switchting to a lower tf and exiting with a opposite bar or a pullback could help.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Exciting on a lower time frame sounds like a good idea, I am looking at 4H and daily for entry and then, probably go down to the 1H for my exit.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
haha good to hear. Always loved the heiken ashi so just trying to get it to make us as much profits as it can.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hey everyone so have been going over all the stuff on here and my plan right now is too check the 4H and Daily for entry, since I can confirm direction on the daily better than the 4H. I also use the Trade Dynamic Index as a third confirmation. I also have the heiken delta arrows which someone posted earlier as just another thing to look at. Also I took off candles or bars on the chart and just use the heiken ashi indi as my main price indicator. I am debating if I should run the heiken ashi regular and smooth at the same time, since it clutters a bit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then for exits I will use the 4H and 1H charts, I am also thinking on how I can partially exit trades once I hit a certain profit. Since I would prefer to have solid profits all the time than huge profits every once in a while. Any ideas? Hedayat Could you post a screen shot of your chart, I am curious what you have running?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hey buddy! Thanks for the update - yeap about the H1 chart exit is a viable exit for H4 and D1 chart exit could be an H4 - I was thinking the same thing - and then after exit we can get back on the ride once the pullback is over and confirmed via the lower TF that we used to exit. My chart? LoL! I posted one I think in the previous page with 2 links, maybe you can have a look buddy? Thanks to everyone for your contribution - H1 exit seems excellent to me!

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thanks buddy! Very sound advise!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hello Hedayat. I really like this simple but effective method. I'd like to share two live trades that I'm currently in using this method. I'm currently +300 pips in profit on usdchf and gbpusd. Thank you for this very unique method. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi all, great thread and very smart system indeed! Since I'm an Ichi trader and fond in heikin ashi candles too, I'm adding to my chart ichimoku and a slow stochastic set to 21,7,3 as confirmation. It seems to work well with about all time frames, even if I prefer weekly, daily and H1. A good entry is according to all Ichimoku and HA signals and the stochastic is between 80 and 20 (not above 80 or below 20). The best conditions are when stochastic just crossed downward 80 line in short trades or upward 20 line in long ones; moreover, the more %K and %D lines are far one eachother, the more that trade promises to be a strong one. Further, Ichimoku provides a very good map of all supports and resistences, of course. I'm sharing my setup, hope someone will try it out and share results too.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Good job there soldier! Hope to see more trades like that for all of us! Keep up the good work! Have fun with you 300 pips! Hope it's a live account! And you're very welcome my friend

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks And I agree, Ichimoku seems to be pretty cool as a confirmation tool and to plan entries/exists ahead of time...and once you're in, the smoothed HA method will make sure you're aware of any sudden trend changes. I worked 39hrs out of the last 48hrs, so my brain's fried...but I'll spend some time contributing more over the weekend

--- 帖子 #118 ---
hey folks, want to spent some live results, i had with today evening trades. eu -&gt; 128 Pips au -&gt; 65 Pips I exited, as mentioned on H1 with the opposite bar. Strategy looks simpe &amp; effective.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I think I came on a little harsh out there when I read back this post - sorry buddy for that tone I used - have a good one and I value all feedback seriously - Keep it coming buddy!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Sindbad, Also a long time Ichimoku trader. I have been experimenting recently with this system just using the Chikou Span as my confirmation. If CS has crossed HA candles, I will take a trade using HA and HAS cross in the same direction. Rick

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi Rick, CS is a very powerful tool. I use to get a trade also as CS crosses the KS and it seems to be another good entry system. When you say about CS candle cross, do you mean the HA candle or the HAS one?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Btw, I forgot to notify that in my setup the stochastic is set on "close/close" and not on "low/hight" as usual.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I am interested in this system, but I can't get my charts to look like yours. When I put the two HA's together, I can't get the separation, on EU, that you all seem to have between the two indicators. One just stacks on the other no matter what time frames. What are the settings that you are using on smooth? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
There are 2 indicators - classic Heiken Ashi and Heikin Ashi smoothed. Rick

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks Rick: I know that there are 2 indicators but here is how my charts look.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hey buddy sorry for the late reply - you know how school work is like lol! I see you have a problem with the indicators. For a start, could you check if your HA smoothed settings are 2,6,3,2 and in that order?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi Sindbad, I use cross of HA. I will definitely look at your stochastics filter. Rick

--- 帖子 #130 ---
loaded the tpl, looks interesting, opened a demo acc to give a try, in short eur/gbp . will post the results of demo trades taken

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Heh, it's all good. My salary's largely commission based, so the more I work, the more $$ comes in. Looking forward to the end of the year when I can beef up my currency account to &gt;$100k for the first time I'll try to fix the Synergy stuff for you guys and reupload those indicators.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Looking forward to that! This system is pretty good although I need more skill to discern the indicators. Managed to score 100 pips yesterday. I kept moving my SL even though it went to 150 and retraced. See below for my entry and exit points.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Thanks again for the input as my smooth settings were different and I used the smoothed.tpl to figure it out. It is fun to be posting again with a new system.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Nice setup! I only managed to spend 15-20min a day to glance at the charts lately, but so far, using the Synergy-HA combo setup, I made 80pips+ every day since starting. Will move over to the real account after the weekend as it seems to work decently. Just a matter of refining the system I also like to add the Chikou (sp) span from the Ichimoku system someone else mentioned as it gives you a good directional indication.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
15-20 mins a day? What TF are you trading on? I cant seem to find any trade yesterday after my EUR/AUD trade closed. I'd be happy with your winnings of 80 pips a day! I just started learning HA this week hence my lack of knowing when to enter/exit. Im now in a USD/JPY trade on h4. Not making much progress though.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Keep in mind I do a once weekly Ichimoku review of all the currencies (takes a good 2-3hrs) I'm trading...that gives me enough "general trend" knowledge to just browse through the currencies quickly throughout the week. This week was mostly USDCHF and AUDUSD. By the way, another system I've used quite a bit to keep me out of bad trades is the MTF Stochs...might add them to the bunch of backup indicators. Will post a screenshot over the weekend...

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi, I find Stoch (21,7,3) or (21,5,3) both look pretty good. They give the same signal like TDI. But I'm also afraid they're late. One thing strange - I can't change the color of HA and HAS permanently. After I switch to another TF, when switching back, the default color restored. Does it happen to you?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
If you use the MTF Stochs, you can stay out of trades whenever a "grid pattern" emerges...works like a charm

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Happens to me buddy! And it sucks that the colours are all the same! Does anyone else has a HA and HA Smooth indicator that allows colours changing (mine allows too) but doesn't change back when switching timeframes? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
80 pips a day is enough to make you a millionaire in one year if it's consistant! Sure I'd love to see that full setup buddy - don't worry wont consider it "spam" lol. There were some issues with gustav and I want to clarify that I will not be typing in harsh tones like that anymore - I'm sorry if I made any of you hold back your improvements or suggestions to the system - keep posting the good stuff pls!!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thanks, 4exNinja. I attach the indicators I find here so someone can take. Big Wins!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thanks @Hed: I think my sample size is waaaaay to small to claim I'm going to be making 80pips consistently. Personally, I'm aiming for 30-50 pips per day over a ton of different currency pairs.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Admire your trading work! Have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Here you go. I changed all colors to blue, white and red. Stays the same colors on all time frames.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Hedayat, Thanks for sharing great system... I'm also evaluating this system.... Regarding color change issue it also happen to my HA indicator. To make the color permanently, just go to HA mq4 file open it and change the color to what you like, then save it and reopen MT4. That's it.. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #146 ---
4exNinja, Can you show a picture of grid pattern that you mean?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thank you for the reply buddy. Quick question, what you mean is I have to open metaeditor and then edit the mq4 file? Is that what you mean? Thank you buddy!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I believe if you follow the H4 method on a ton of currencies (maybe 6 currencies?) and set your TP at 30 pips you should be able to live a lavish life - having said that, remember money management is most important!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi with you trading do you wait for the tenkan sen to cross thekijun sen above the cloud and indeed do yo wait for price action to be above the cloud? Also what stop do you set?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Yes, you are right...

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Guys, Just an observation here please. It would rather be cool if you guys explaining stuffs can also elaborate by way of charts and attachments. so it makes things clearer and more understandable. just as Hedayat did in his first post. Also if possible and where necessary,a Template too could go a long way. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi 4exNinja, are you so kind to show to us your "grid pattern" with a chart? thanks

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hey no worries, I am still in college so was kind of sleep deprived and wrote that post without really explaining my plan, so it looked like I was advertising another system. Ill make sure to make it more detailed from now on what I try to do. Keep up the good work everyone.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
hey thanks again for posting this, its imho the best system i have found in a loooooooooong time, i can use it to scalp 1 min and i put on trades on 4 hours too successfully ! edit: up 20%

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Meh, will be until towards the end of the week when I can summarize what I'm doing...too busy at work. +92pips GBPUSD today...checked 8 charts in like 5min and found it before I had to head off to work

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Many thanks Hedayat and others for contributions to this great system. Hay anyone decided on a chop filter? I've been looking at the Black Dog black arrow EMA 20 - EMA 100, which seems to filter trades not taken in the trending direction. Regards

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Try an 8 SMA and a 36 SMA. When the 8 SMA is above the 36 SMA, only take long trades. When the 8 SMA is below the 36 SMA only take short trades. Just my 2 cents. ~fighter

Thanks fighter dude. Will check out. Regards

Thanks for the contribution buddy! Could you explain how the alert works? Thanks once again

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Here is my latest chart its running both regular heiken ashi and heiken ashi smooth. I have a 8 and 36 SMA that was recommended by fighterdude which I am still deciding if I like or not. And at the bottom I am running a TDI to confirm my entrys and exits. The two red arrows show when both heiken ashi indis go long or short. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I want to look at getting an alert indicator so I can know when a chart is long or short. I know someone on the forum has a dashboard system that might work for this, so I will see how that works and let yall know. And quick question what pairs are yall trying this on?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Sure. I haven't traded this system yet. Just kinda putting indicators and colors together based on your hybrid HA system. I'm using a 5 min chart for the examples in this post. I've been filtering back through the past and it looks pretty good. The Black Dog filter is just a ma cross alert with arrows, which does not repaint. When I get a down arrow from that indicator, then I would look for the next trade for only short setups (reverse for longs) and I don't use the Black Dog indicator itself as an entry signal. When a short trade opportunity comes up (as an example) I would enter with the first magenta bar and when a blue bar shows up with a red bar on top, I'm looking at using that as a soft exit (might exit, might not - that's just a judgement call). But if a full blue bar appears by itself, then that is a hard exit signal to get out of the trade, either with a break-even, profit or loss. I use the Heiken Ashi Kuskus indicator just to fill in the extra space, which gives it a cleaner and smoother look and I black out the top and bottom shadow bars on all the HA indicators. The Heiken Ashi Kuskus has the color problem though because it's an ex4 file (can't be altered). It will change back to red and white (which is a mute point if you like those colors). This modification works on all time frames, just as your original setup. Here's the charts and indicators (I use the HA indicators with normal settings) The settings for the Black Dog indicator are EMA 20 and EMA 100. Attachment The indicator for the Heiken Ashi Smoothed Alert used in the red and white chart is below:

Are you using this for pure scalp purposes? I like the idea I just cant be watching my monitor so much to trade off the 5 and 15 min charts.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Oops! forgot second chart: Here's the second chart with the last Black Dog indicator arrow pointing down. Regards

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Yea, for the most part in a scalp mode, as I'm only trade when I'm in front of the monitor. It should work on all the time frames though. Haven't included any alerts for this chart as of yet. Regards

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Sorry about the resolution. Better resolution with corrected blue bar.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Sorry guys, not sure if this has been asked but does the HA smoothed repaint?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Ill give it a try tomorrow, I am busy working on some stuff tonight. I mainly use 4H and Daily so Ill see how I like the different colors and indi.

it's a simple 500$ deposit but it's now at 624.20$ used etoro so i could have made alot more because of the 3 pips spread

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Davlo No, it doesn't. Regards

--- 帖子 #176 ---
thanks Countpips, i appreciate the response

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Im having tremendous success with this method. Yesterday scored 100 pips with EUR/CAD. Today scored 100 pips with EUR/USD. Have an open USD/CHF trade at +30 pips. Heres yesterday's EUR/CAD trade: Entry: MA lines open, downtrend, TMS-OST all red, entered (for some reason the h1 is showing black in the chart below but it was all red when i entered) Exit: I took 100 pips and ran with it. Of course i was monitoring for any reversals/retracements.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Yup Used the smoothed HA candles, Synergy MTF Price Action, Synergy TDI, Synergy MTF TMS-Osc, a 5EMA, and a 5WMA for confirmation. Everything lined up nicely. I think key will be not to overtrade. Most trades on the 4hr result in 50pips+, so there really is no need to trade when things don't line up. I wish there was a quick way to browse all currency pairs without having to "open new chart", and then "apply template", and "pick TF" every single time. Major flaw in MT4, Oanda 's software seems a lot better...no custom indicators though Also up around 30pips shorting EURUSD this morning...was above 50pips but there's a minor retractment now. I still think shorting the Euro is the only sensible thing right now given fundamentals... Snatched up another 80pips+ over night shorting AUDGBP because I had a feeling their national bank will cut rates. All indicators lined up nicely 3-4hrs before the news announcement. By the way, there's 9 people who voted "against" the system. I'm just curious as to why? Could you let us know why you believe this system won't work? Just curious because in the few trades I made, it showed very promising results.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Still waiting patiently for your free time for those additional indicators and the ones that are supposed to be working but arent. Just curious, do you follow Hedayat's method of a 100 pips as a SL or do you have your own? I tend to think 60 pips is enough. I think a faster way would be to save these templates as a different profiles so when theres a need to switch templates (maybe 10-15 charts), u can load up a different set of templates (another 10-15 charts) with just 2 clicks.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks for the profile tip, completely forgot about that...will make my life A LOT easier! As for stop losses, I use 5 different exit strategies: 1) Indicators show a reversal. 2) Major support/resistance levels. 3) 5 EMA or 5 WMA (depending on whether I'm short/long) 4) ATR of the last 1-3 candles (depending on strength of movement) 5) Kijun Sen results in fairly large SL, but seems to work great as an "emergency stop" Personally, I'm not a fan of fixed stop losses, so I generally move my SL to break even once I'm 30-40 pips up, and will use a trailing stop after that. Most of the time, I close trades manually though. I'm also not a fan of fixed profit taking strategies since I like riding a trend as long as I can... I'll upload a revised template once I had a bit more time to refine that strategy. Current indicators: 1) HA &amp; Smoothed HA 2) MTF TMS-Osc (Synergy) 3) TDI (Synergy too because it shows flexible upper and lower bands) 4) 5 EMA (shifted 2, HLC/3) and 5 WMA (linear weighted, no shift, close) 5) MTF Price Action (Synergy) 6) MTF TMS-Osc In short, I'm mixing the elements of Synergy with the HA approach. Seems to work great so far, just need to refine my entry/exit rules.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
could you post the indi MTF TMS-Osc (Synergy) thanks

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Will do once I get home from work

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I have never been a big fan of fixed stop loss either, I normally end up with a fixed catastrophic SL just as a precaution in case the world ends lol and then use SteveHopwood MTMP to manage my open trades while I sleep. Great piece of software Ill upload when I get home or you can just search the forum for it. Its nice since it will move your stoploss to break even once your x amount of pips in profit, and you can customize it to your hearts desire.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thanks Automating a lot of this will be my next goal once I'm done refining entries/exits.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
up at 672.50$ almost another 10% today ! scalping 1min ftw btw i also watch alot the higher highs, higher low (and vice versa) to find the trend direction

--- 帖子 #186 ---
you use this method for scalp in timeframe 1min ?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Nice one I wiped out all my morning profits because once again I was a donkey and traded from my phone in between meetings. Kinda sucks taking a short term trade if you can't keep an eye on it for 2hrs

--- 帖子 #188 ---
ninja have you an idee for out a position ? because inverse indicators isn t a good idea :/ And in TF30 i have a lot of fake signal (i developed an ea based on your system)

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes i will post later on example of trades with a chart edit: up to 727$.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
final war i am very interesting on scalp for this method. Currently i use it on TF30 but i dont know how code my ea to out position. Have you an idea ?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Nice going everyone. I see many of the esteemed people in this thread are gaining confidence in the system. jhd: You developed an EA? great! Any intentions to share it for the benefit of all? I think the stevehopwood position manager would be a wonderful idea to be using to manage SL positions - nice thinking there..am looking forward to it being uploaded. This week has been a little slow for me (did not take all signals from my system) - simply because I cared too much about fundamentals as well as waiting for a major reversal to occur on the D1 charts - you know, follow the trend.

Nice going there! Wanna share your scalping strategies buddy? Any additions to the original idea? I guess you're the most successful trader in this thread for the system for now - good job mate! If only you had scalped my 50K account - man!!! Lol!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi all, really nice thread. I've taken a look through and had some ideas about helping to reduce fake moves. First I have changed the HA smoothed indie to show the HA smoothed as just one solid body without wicks, I believe this makes the chart clearer. Next I have added the quickdraw indie to draw lines at every round number. As a general rule of thumb don't trade into s/r, the best trades will always be away from the s/r level. This also gives you a logical place to put your stop loss, I use 20 pips above the last s/r level. For exits with HA candles I always trail behind any wicks. If you look at a good HA trend you will notice the flat bottoms in an uptrend and flat tops in a downtrend. What this essentially means is that the mid point of the previous candle was not breached by the price of the current candle. When wicks appear on HA candles then you know the trend is either slowing down and about to reverse or at least taking a breather. I find trailing the stop down behind any wicks that form an effective way of maximising your gain. Sometimes you stay in the trade, sometimes the next candle gets you out. If the trade has gone a long way already and is approaching strong s/r I will move the stop loss to just above the open of the previous candle or even the current candle if I am keen to get out for the weekend or something. I have attached a screen shot of a usdchf hourly trade taken this evening and the indicators I mentioned. I have used hourly as I find I am more comfortable trading that timeframe. I think any less would be too noisy and any bigger for me would be too long between trades, just a personal thing. I hope some of this helps? Sorry I was late to the party, been busy trading :-) By the way, on the quick draw indie I have added an option to alter the width of the lines in the inputs box.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Also I would like to clarify the original system rules if I can. You are entering when a candle CLOSES above or below the HA smoothed? Is that the case?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
ok here is what i consider valid entries, yes some are losing trades, it's normal nothing is perfect. i normally enter a high leverage trade and quit at least the first half in the at 10pips profit, the other half i just close it at reverse edit: i use tms template but i dont check tdi at all http://i.imgur.com/0oRbz.gif

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Yes the ea will be share for free when i terminate it (on sunday i think) finalwar could you gimme more detail please.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Looking at it myself I like the idea of entering once a HA body closes above/below the HA smoothed. That way you know the trend in that direction has some strength. Also if you are using the round number lines and a signal appears just the wrong side of it, ie you would be trading directly into s/r then just wait for a close above/below the s/r and then enter. Again, you have a good place to put your stop loss and increase your probability of a good trade.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
i just switched to your complete wick smoothed ashi and my alerts (above) are almost always on the first or 2nd complete wick of that color, seem like a great tool http://i.imgur.com/hA7rJ.gif

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Yes, I think it makes the chart look cleaner and easier to use. When a normal HA closes the other side of the smoothed HA it is usually a fair signal. I definitely like it in conjunction with the round numbers as well.

Found this on another forum; here is the setup. Use 1:4 or 1:6 ratio. Example: 1:6 ratio: Trade 5 min chart then set up trend line on 30 min chart. Example: 1:6 ratio: Trade H4 chart then set up trend line on day chart. Draw 4 lines: 240/Weighted High Blue 240/Weighted Low Blue 60/Smoothed High Magenta 60Smoothed Low Magenta Price line below enter short trades. Price line above enter long trades. Example Chart:

1min scalp 1- i enter because of the smoothed ashi color reversal (blue) with a strong move from the regular ashi. 2- smoothed ashi color reversal (purple) but the move of the regular ashi is not strong enough, make sure to always wait for the close of the candle before making/exit a trade. 3- smoothed ashi reversal (blue) uptrend continue, and i quit with a 20 pips profit edit: does anybody have a good timer ?

Thanks for some clear &amp; simple charts with explanations. This thread almost lost me when posts re. coding, EAs, etc. started appearing as I am a complete boob about computers, much less coding. I also don't see the value of the MAs as they mimmick the candle action anyway. They do show the spread between the two as appearing stronger than between the two sets of candles but I like cleaner charts. Thanks Hugh, great posts. p.

trade 2 and 3 [ Trade 2 ] short at red vertical line it was the first strong regular ashi with a smoothed ashi color reversal was looking for 10-15 pips, did not reach, i closed at horizontal red line (when i entered trade 3 (green)) losing 1 pip [ Trade 3 ] at the vertical green line, i took a trade long because i consider it a strong regular ashi in a color reversal smoothed ashi, closed 16 pips in profit, it actually rallied 15 pips more. first time i trade on tokyo so i was looking at small TP. http://i.imgur.com/LRpqq.gif

edit: does anybody have a good timer ? (to know when candle closes)

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hey chief! Yup great idea - that was the original idea of the thread actually - to open a trade when the HA default closes above or below the HA smooth - with a tiny space between them. About the round number lines, sure will try them out - as I know for a fact it has psychological implications for many big traders - good idea buddy! Thanks for all the inputs

--- 帖子 #208 ---
That should do the work of breakeven stop losses when I am out! Thanks chief!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Nice work buddy! How does the results look so far? Anyhow, if you could, could you also add the option to allow trades to be taken only if another TF agrees? E.g - say D1 is set as the secondary TF, then when taking trades on H1 (where we presumably put the EA to work on), and D1 shows long candle of HA smooth, then the EA would only take long positions on H1 - short positions being ignored. This could eliminate further fake moves! Thanks buddy!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hello, What settings are you using for the HA smoothed kuskus etc? Could you post the template for the chart please? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #211 ---
how has your trading been today?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
i did not trade yet. i am currently looking at the 5min tf, doing some back testing to try identify most moves and to calculate a average pips per move i could use as a tp. unfortunately its not aways easy to trade 1 min tf while at work. seriously all tf work with this smoothed thing i dont know why but i find it pretty interesting.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
that´s true. How many days have you been trading 1m tf? 2 days?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
3 days

--- 帖子 #215 ---
i was playing a bit with my settings on 5min tf, i accidentally removed the regular ashi it seems that we could only play the smoothed ashi reversal and make money ill look into in further

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thats the current system I am working on and testing live too

--- 帖子 #217 ---
if it really works i guess i would be easy to code a EA to enter/quit trades on color change made a quick 10 pips on 5min tf using only the smoothed ha color change edit: another 10 pips on color change

--- 帖子 #218 ---
FinalWar i develop it for you for free check your mails

--- 帖子 #219 ---
The current version I am experimenting live with 0.5 lots is as follows; Distinguish D1 trend - blue, long - red, short. With that, lets take for example D1 trend is blue on a pair X. As such, only LONG trades would be taken on this pair but with crosses of a closed candle in the same direction (1 candle before is opposite colour - fresh cross) as D1. So all long crosses on say a preset TF like H1 or H4 will be taken on this pair follow D1 trend - very simple trend following method. TP is either wait until the reverse cross occurs or a preset TP that you're comfortable with - this way you would exit the trend halfway though. Could you code an EA alongside such rules? following the D1 trend gives much less fake trades and only taking high profitability trades. Thank you ma man!

--- 帖子 #222 ---
this i am currently working with jhd to make the ea he told me that he launched the ea v1 on 12 pairs, and he's up 120 pips already haha

--- 帖子 #223 ---
EA is using just the HA smooth or Hedayat's way? Thanks

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Ha smooth only on 5min tf i dont think a ea can know if the regular ha is strong or not... we will see later on we will begin with this and update it as long as we can

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Yeap the above post where i mentioned about making/editing the EA for the new system is only using and depending on HA smooth crosses - but taking into account the "D1" trend.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
ok thanks we will look into it atm ea is down 1.5%, i removed eurchf from the pairs we trade cause it's ranging to much, ea has some problems as he does not respect the tp, it's suposed to be 15 pip (close half position) atm but sometimes he takes half position profit between 3-5 pips and put the stop lost at even at that point when we are suposed to be 10 pips farther up or down in our move? don't know why. don't always take the trade on the opposite side when he just closed a bad trade. we still have some more development to do, don't worry we will update you guys

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Haha actually I'm doing well with this system - generates more signals than the original HA hybrid method. The catch is, you need to be like stuck infront of the computer to wait for setups - trading a 15m chart can have you waiting for hours. This is precisely why I need the EA hahaha! I think most of us want EAs cause not because they are lazy, but just cannot stand the depression of waiting infront of charts for hours. Thanks buddy...would love to see it pop up here soon! Wee! When is the beta release? lol! Edit: Ok buddy got it! Sure do. You got my support for that sweet development! Keep us posted and thanks a million!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Lads, The HA Smoothed is just the cross of two MAs. On default setting its 6 Smooth MA crossed with 2 EMA, the 2 above or below the 6 gives blue or red. Which is why HA Smoothed in a ranging period is not good cuz of the MAs and they are lagging. Put it on your charts and you'll see its very similar if not the same, But if you want to use it, why not just use MAs in the EA?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
ty for the info, i looked at it and you are right however is can't be that simple we will have to modify ea to measure strength of movement

--- 帖子 #230 ---
What and how do you mean measure the strength of the movement?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
let's say the smoothed ha change color but does not move more than 5pips up we would ignore the trade. it's a example but we will have to measure exactly what move in pips can be considered as a strong move see between the green lines its a change of color with no strength http://i.imgur.com/VKFBA.gif edit: if you look 2 candle to the left of the green line, you will see a smoothed ha color change with a strong movement of the regular ha

--- 帖子 #232 ---
The distance between Close 6 smoothed MA and Close 2 EMA in pips ?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
well with humain eye you can see without any problem a big candle would do the thing, however for the ea to reproduce it, it would be harder... so yeah in pips i guess we will have to make alot of try/errors

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Have I missed something? I think your chart is showing regular candlesticks plus smoothed HA, correct? And is this how you may possible set up a trading strategy? I like the idea of this strategy but as it is a study in motion/progress I may not be following your examples correctly. Thanks for everyone's input and work. p.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
yes i normally trade without them, but it's more accurate for human hand trading to have them or ha, one or the other would do btw here is the link of our first night of trading (up 2% (280 pips) with 0.20 lots on 5000$ demo account) remember it's full of bugs / errors etc http://www.fxstat.com/performances/v...ed_EA_1_0-7940

--- 帖子 #236 ---
That is the best I've seen so far - closes to the holy grail (although it doesn't exist) Lol... May I ask what parameters ur using for the EA? entry and exit rules buddy? Which TF? Thanks buddy! Have a great day ahead - looking forward to automate the simple HA smooth strat!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
we are up 2.36% now just updated the previous fxstat link, will post the new page soon as the version 0.2 is out of the factory! buy at smoothed ha blue, sell at smoothed ha red Half position sold at +15 (this wasn't working correctly should in version 0.2) + put SL at even The remaining half always exit on reverse, if TP not reach quit and reenter on the other side if color change. Were are trying in v0.2 : hours to trade - trade from london open to end of new york Hard stoploss at SL at 15 pips to try not to get hurt to much by reversals

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I think we have a winner here man! Hmm could you try to put the secondary TF confirmation option? like if set to true, then check TF2 for trend direction. If false, it goes with every reversal on only the current TF. Btw u are testing on TF m5? Thanks for the great work buddy! Love the SL at BE idea - cld save many pips!

--- 帖子 #239 ---
cool! is you EA running today?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
More future will be add to ea 2 lvl of tp Timzone trades ...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Nice job Seems like I have a ton of reading to catch up on over the weekend...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
ok v0.2 of the ea is really full of bug even more than the first one. We realized something from the ea 0.1, the bug itself made it considerably profitable, having 85% + trades in profit because it was closing the trade early (3 4 or 5 pips in green instead of 15) so what we will do with 0.2.5 will be to make it scalp, we will make 3 version of the ea, 1 scalping 3pips sl 10 , 1 scalping 4 pips sl 12.5, 1 scalping 5 pips sl 15. we will then put it to the test on next week (for the whole week each) and we will post results here on the thread.

Hi all, I'm just thinking about how this strategy might work with the Futures Market, like YM or another E-mini, I'm still a little confused about the actual condition for Entries and I know that everyone is working on the exits right now. I'm looking at using the Ichimoku Clouds for confirmation on entries but like everyone else still trying to find that perfect exit. A quick question for an entry, in the Original Post, the rule was to wait for the Close of the Heiken Ashi Smooth to cross the Heiken Ashi normal, however later on in a post, the OP mentioned that there should be a gap in between the bars??? Are we talking about a gap between the Open and Close of the bars of each series or would this include the High and Low shadows/wicks of the candles too? Has anyone tried this system with Futures yet or will I be the first ? Thanks all David

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hey buddy, as for entries, just look for the HA default to close slightly above HA smooth - with a small little visible gap between them. However, if you find that a waste, and you could do better with no gaps in between but just a cross, please do test and post your results. As for future contracts, I have tried it on CFDs and stock indices, it does work a charm still! Take care and have a great week ahead!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hey, thank you for your response and for your explanation. I will do some tests on YM because I like this Futures contract :-) and I can do some real back testing on it too. I built myself my own true back testing tool which calculates P/L on the real bid and ask prices at that precise traded moment. I stored basically every tick, traded, bid and ask updates for YM to my database: solely for this purposes of back testing, and I have data from over the past few months :-) Nothing like being prepared especially when it comes to money :-) I am not using Meta Trader because I haven't found a version that will allow me to trade futures so I apologies ahead of time if I ask dumb questions regarding special indicators for confirmation of entries and exits so I will be trying to get my head around Meta Trader programming language so that I can convert them into my trading app. I am more than willing to share my back testing results with real expected profits/losses so just shoot me a strategy or two that I can program into my system and I'll post up the results with pleasure. I'm sure this will help many others who might want to try a strategy but don't want to waste the time in simulation etc... I've been looking for a flexible consistent system that can work over many types of equities and time frames and I really believe that this strategy is one of the best I've seen yet! Well done for thinking it up Hedayat :-) Anyway, I am looking at confirmations using the ichimoku clouds but think we might need something else to confirm our entries a little earlier. Any suggestions? Thanks everyone. My msn is davidt@ cmseverything dot com (remove the spaces and replace the dot with .) Have a good and profitable trading week everyone. And thank you for making me feel so welcomed to this group and thread discussion David

Alpari UK Classic account offers forex, spot metals and indices, cfds and a good range of futures. I have used them for a long time and find the spreads and execution acceptable. Also I believe Ava FX offer a good range of trading instruments.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
thank you Hugh, I will look into these. I'm in Canada so let's just hope they will accept Canadian accounts! I'm a British Ex Pat... lol

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I'm not sure about Canada, I know Alpari have a US arm. I don't see that there would be a problem but be prepared that they may not offer an account in CAD, you may have to have a USD or GBP account. Have you tried google for "mt4 broker futures cfd canada"?

Dear all, HA-smoothed is repainted or at least we have to wait for a candle close to make sure its color.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hey buddy, Spot on! HA Smooth (and default) repaints but once it's closed, it NEVER repaints. This is the reason why we make trade decisions based only on closed candles

To All, For a relative beginner, can someone explain in simple language what the default and smoothed indicators are? Also, I have read of the TDI being used elsewhere but cannot find any definition of it - can I ask for help with that as well? Thanks, Anthony

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Still alive, but work's been insane the past 2 weeks...no energy to check out charts if I'm doing similar stuff all day at work. BUT, I got the entire next week off, so I'll spend a lot of time digging into the system. By the way, at the start of this thread I started using MTF HA as confirmation...as it turns out, someone had the same idea and created a system called Invictus. It uses HA candles and the MTF HA...no smoothed HA candles though (although I created a template combining the 2 systems). I think I finalized my chart setup though...and realized HA smoothed seems to work ok at 15min if you use the MTF and price action as confirmation http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/Smoo...ictus%20HA.png The Invictus EA is a simple trailing stop EA...it does nothing more. The reason I use it is, I'll enter trades manually over my Android phone (remote desktop), but don't have time to check too often. I set it to 5pips on 15min chart, and it only starts once I'm up 5 pips. So if I catch a good momentum and once I hit the first 5 pips, I can basically forget about the trade. I use the HA smoothed to visualize entries, and the other indicators as confirmation and to test whether or not a re-entry should be taken or not after a (small) retractment. By the way, please let me know if you don't want me to talk about mixing other indicators with HA smoothed...don't wanna spam this thread. But I think to make it work for lower timeframes, it's 100% necessary I'm afraid. Too many fake signals if you don't get a "2nd opinion". Also, that Invictus system isn't mine, I just had a read through the forums earlier this week and figured it could work great together with smoothed HA candles

--- 帖子 #271 ---
for EA idea what you want is when two Heiken Ashi show same direction. that is entry signal. forgot about crossover.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
So it seems HA smoothed candles DO work @ 15min if you combine it without an ATR/RmUp/Dn indicator, and a 15min/1hr/4hr MTF HA indicator Started using MPTM to manage my trades once entered and got a nice +27pips before passing out on the sofa last night. Would have grabbed another 50 pips in the afternoon if I hadn't been asleep...all entry conditions were met Here's my 15min chart setup: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/Scre...2014.24.14.png And here's my 4hr chart setup: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/Scre...2014.23.06.png As you notice, I now always have regular candles, HA candles, as well as HA smooth candles on my charts. That way I get 3 ways to confirm trades

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi 4exNinja, I'm a noob so I hope you don't mind me asking some basic questions. I saw your post and it intrigued me. May I ask what settings you use for the ATR? Also, what is RmUp/Dn ? Lastly, what is MPTM? Thanks man James

--- 帖子 #276 ---
For the ATR and RmUp/Dn stuff, check out the "Invictus" thread The setup is a bit of a mix between Invictus, a Haiken Ashi smoothed system I started looking into, and a chart setup I found in nanningbob's 4hr thread. All of these are good reads

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi 4exNinja, Nice to see you. What is the band on this chart? I don't think it's BollingerBand, right? Kind Regards,

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Those are two different Bollinger bands They come in handy because price often bounces of them...makes it easier to pick good entries/exists.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
could you say me all indicators you use please

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Sure Main chart screen: 2x Bollinger bands 1x Haiken Ashi smoothed 1x EMA (not really needed, just a visual reference) 1x regular candle sticks 1x Higher-high/lower-low/lower-high/higher-low indicator Side screen 1: 2x Stochiastics (14,3,5 and 7,3,3) Side screen 2: 1x FX5_Macd_divergence v1.0 Side screen 3: HAzz2-240 (shows Haiken Ashi candles as a histogram) All of those indicators can be found on these boards On a side note, +23.53% today trading EU/GU. Max drawdown was 6.15%. The Haiken Ashi smoothed are a great visual aid that tell you to WAKE UP whenever a move is imminent. Paired with daily pivots, and a few other indicators I mentioned above, it's working great so far. That was trading the 15min and using the 1hr and 4hr as confirmation. Will try to specify my entry/exit rules a bit better over the coming days.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
could you send me all your indicators please. Im interested in them

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Will upload them later when I get home

--- 帖子 #283 ---
ok thanx

Great work on the hadelta indicator. So the equation is not given in the book? What are people's thoughts on the book? I am thinking of buying it. Many thanks

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Does anyone have the .mt4 file for the haDelta.eq4 indicator that is posted on this thread. I want to try and display this indicator within my share trading platform (Sharescope) and have coded it up but it is not centred around zero.... Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Does anyone read this thread anymore?

I am...but no time to trade, end-of-year stress at work.

Looks like this thread is now dead... :-(

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I have to admit I switched systems. Still trading with Heikin Ashi candles though. I just didn't want to derail the thread by talking about another system. Using THV on 4hr charts with some extra indicators, and this works really well for me.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi 4exNinja, Please share your method, I tried THV on 4 hour charts too and it seemed promising but I never quite managed to make it work. The activity in this thread has been so low lately it would be surprising if anyone mind posts about another system.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
This is a great indicator indeed.React faster than MA and it smooth the correction of trend especially in low time frame chart. I just write something here to refresh this thread, it is likely dead but great tool. Share with everyone.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
For anyone who wish to refresh their mind can come visit my new thread here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=404196 regarding HA and HAS system. It is somehow similar with this strategy but I found using them on higher timeframe with MTF usage gives us powerful setup. Cheers

Hi Hedayat....I am wondering if you are still working with your HA/HAS Hybrid strategy and this thread? I am interested in working with it. If you are available for questions and comments...let me know. I've attached a screen shot so you know I am a serious trader. Entry possibilities are marked with little orange marks. Thanks posting your ideas...looks like a great system. Bryan

Hey guys! Hope all is well with everyone and trading has been great. For myself, I got caught up in the rat race after graduation and have been crazy busy with my job that I die a little each time I get on bed - naturally trading has been on the pause too. I started looking at charts again recently and have come back to see how peeps are doing here - looking good so far. bryn077, how can I help you buddy? I looked at the chart - do you only use HA Smooth and regular candles? Cheers everyone!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Hedayat...Congrats on graduating, and please feel free to call me Bryan. I was wondering if you had 'tuned' your system. I have been working with it but on Daily charts with some success. I am using HA and HAS. I also use a handful of other indicators...like, weekly pivots, ADX, and momentum oscillators...I look for divergence. But at the end of the day, it's really just about price...for me. Are you going to get back into trading and work more with your strategy? Thanks, Bryan

Hi there I´m also looking at this indicators HHS. they look to be good. So i will be following this sistem. But for now i would like to see more charts examples and a clean define rules that traders could improve and follow. For now this threat is just a lot of opinios and no clear direction. Lets start from begining and analise charts make some stats of eatch idea and improve the sistem atill we can go. Hope you traders can do some hard work. All the best Alfredo

--- 帖子 #297 ---
my 0.02$ in here I´m looking at similar trading sistem, using HHS. i made some backtest by hand and i got this. EURUSD 20 days 73 trades. http://my.jetscreenshot.com/2168/20130520-ck0m-78kb.jpg rules http://my.jetscreenshot.com/2168/201...xbtf-260kb.jpg a bit difrent from the ones Hedayat uses. This is the kind of study we need to improve to see the best setting for the indicators and the best of all is a EA to backtest it hard. But Backtest can be missleading. I would prefer a EA and demo trade it. Hope anyone can join us and code one. All the best Alfredo Hope someone post some strats about their ideas to improve this. Making some pips in a day is not enought to prove a sistem.

Hey Alfredo...I actually gave up on this thread but worked with the set-up for about 2 months and did alright. I used it on daily charts. But, I am now working with a different approach for the time being. But I can tell you what I know and post some charts if you are interested...In the future I may very well use this system again. I looked for 2 signals...first, a cross like Hedayat defined and like you have in your chart markup. Second, I would look for inside HA bars in the direction of the trend. I used it for trend trading and 'following price.' Here is a screen shot from 3-15 on the p/yen. This was a good entry...you see the little orange mark on my chart - march 7th. That is when I placed my buy stop. You can see the clean cross of the HA and HAS and the little gap in between the candles. Then it just took off for over 200 pips. For me on the daily charts...this was quite a powerful way to trade. But, I did not like the potential drawdown that can come from trend trading daily charts. Though it looks like you are trading this on smaller time-frames? thx, Bryan GBP/YEN DAILY

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hello Brayan007 thanks for your replay. Its seams to work nice in higher tf than 5m Today this trades could easy be taken on EU http://my.jetscreenshot.com/2168/m_2...e8v1-251kb.jpg But this needs improvement sugestions are welcome

--- 帖子 #300 ---
That looks pretty good man. I see what you are doing and I think this approach will work on any time-frame. Take your pic. Here are a few trade setups I saw on the 5 minute charts earlier today...around 7:30 Eastern Time US. It is not the HA Hybrid but it works very similar...I look for momentum in one direction, wait for the retrace to come near my 50 ema and for my CCI to be in a extreme condition...in an uptrend I want to see the CCI oversold and in a downtrend, overbought. The entry points are marked in orange and I have circled those conditions on my CCI. I also use Weekly pivots and look for trades off of support and resistance and psycho levels....and CCI divergence. If that chart set-up is working for you...perhaps you just want to apply a CCI indicator and see how it works ? in MT4 I set my CCI to 34. This was the AUD/USD and USD/CAD 5 minutes thx, Bryan

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi there This method needs more work on it. CCI migth work but what i see is that sometimes we get late entries and late exits. http://my.jetscreenshot.com/2168/m_2...hkjn-238kb.jpg so we need to get out at profit or move stop to Break even as fast as possible.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
you got it man, especially on short time frames. The market can sense when you are in profit and will try to take you out, so you gotta be patient with wide stops or lock in your profit quick. This market looks a bit choppy - or, sideways. I would only trade the Hedayat Hybrid in a clearly trending environment. And, when volume is high if on short timeframes. With larger time-frames volume is not as critical. Also, be careful about entering on BIG bars...they can snap back on you real quick. Look for little bars with tighter technical stops. As for the CCI, yes it will lag like most indicators...so if you are going to use it...you need to be looking for your potential entry as soon as the CCI is nearing extreme levels. I'll see if I can spot some trades and post some charts this week. thx, Bryan

To all, Is Heiken Ashi Smooted (HAS) here is the latest? Can I have the latest/new version of this Heiken Ashi Smoothed (HAS)?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi there Handsgod...I will up-load the version I have for MT4. Though what I am posting is FXCM marketscope not MT4. and Alfredo...I did not have time to look for actual set-ups with the hybrid...though I have marked up a chart of good entries based on how I approach the strategy...this is a 4 hour chart Euro/CAD. (entries circled in yellow) There is one good cross there at the bottom of the screen, if you got in there you could have made a ton of pips...but also look at getting in on the retracements which are the inside HA bars in that up-swing...if the HAS does not change color, you remain in the trade. The downward leg of this trend was not very clean...and I would avoid those big bearish bars as entries short...they are price traps. And again, I like to see the CCI nearing extreme conditions before considering a trade. I also use Weekly pivots, when price breaks these levels then retraces back to them, that can be a good entry. I am not going to trade this sytstem right now...but it is a good way to trade and if people want to post ideas and potential set-ups I'd be happy to discuss the trades, and possible enter. Eur/CAD 4 hour

--- 帖子 #305 ---
HAS smooth for MT4...there may be a newer version but probably not.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Here is a possible entry Long on the same pair....Eur/Cad 4 hour. Price is retracing back to support at R2. I would not place a trade on a 4 hour chart on Friday late in the session. I'll see where that is on Sunday. Eur/Cad 4 hour

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks a lot bryn077 for the HAS.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thank you Hedayat SM for sharing the strategy. The truth is that t his strategy will give alot of fakeouts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have developed such a strategy before and it never worked perfectly. Why not just trade the normal HA candles or the APB candles with your Ema(5) and macd(3,10,16) to spot divergence, also as the market move in your favour shift your StopLoss right behind the last two candles before your current candle to prevent loss of profit and to minimize losses for trade management purpose. Trade with peace of mind with perfect entry and exit. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hello Dare Thanks for your inputs Could you please go in deeper in your findings. Could you post some charts. Bryan Thanks for the charts i still trying some other stuf that could bring some clear view how to take advantege of this indicator. It can give good entries but the exits are not good. So how to take advantege os this? Set a fix pip target? Like a fixed number of pips per trade ex: 20 pips Move stop to BE to prevent losers? I will look at this possibility and see how many winners and how many losers we got from this. I will post them when i can. The problem with indicators they are always late and the oversold could not be over also the oposit. I dont trust tehm. But it is a matter of Stats. If we have a good RR and a good winner loser relation we will win in the long time. This can be analise looking at charts. Regards Alfredo

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I know this system is not perfect, but I want to thanks to Hedayat SM for this thread. And maybe you are the first one to developed this system, but I'm sure he did not mean to plagiarize your work. But the point is, he started this thread to give us, the trader, some contribution. For me, this thread give me an idea to combined to my system to be more . It's like the "aha" when our master Leonardo Fibonacci find the simple one. http://www.babypips.com/school/fibonacci-who.html Not to be wise, but, take the positive point. Be humble. Please, take my .

--- 帖子 #311 ---
That sounds good Dare 123 but the market is filled with fakeouts no matter what approach you take...that is how the forex market exists. Like Alfredo suggests perhaps you can offer some chart analysis. thx, Bryan

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Alfredo...I did not receive these posts to my e-mail otherwise I would have responded earlier. Let me post my recent thoughts on that Eur/CAD set up and digest what you said...If I can offer constructive support I will. Here on the Euro/Cad 4 HOUR chart nothing has really moved. Lat Friday I was not thinking of the Memorial day holiday, and tomorrow is a news event for Canada (BoC interest rate) The pair has constricted. Originally I thought of a possible buy stop at 1.34. Though, I wanted to see a false break to the upside, and then a quick move down before I placed the buy stop. This did happen but not with enough movement at all to place an order. see second image circles in blue. I Imagine tomorrows news will move the pair. Eur/Cad 4 hour chart thx, Bryan

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi Alfredo...Exits can be hard to deal with, Hedayat actually mentioned this several times in his early post. But I think exits are difficult for young traders...like me, no matter how you approach the charts. Just so you know, I am pretty much a break even trader just starting to see more consistent profits. I can contribute to this thread because I have already seen my fair share of losses...lots. okay...Yeah you can set a fixed number of pips per trade. Right now I have a daily pip target I look for, once I hit it, I close all any trades and call it a day. I think that is kind of a scalping mentality. And I think 15 min charts are good scalping charts. If you have a decent profit on a trade take it until you have developed the patience and skill to hit targets with more consistency. If I am on a 5/15 min chart - 5 to 10 pips is ok with me, and I can probably get 3 to 5 trades from 7 to 10;30 am ET. If I move up to 30 min charts and bigger where support and resistance is clear...I will look to hit targets at support and resistance. What are the settings you are using for your hybrid set up ? and what kind of orders do you place...buy/sell stop...limit orders ? This is very important. If you are trading with the direction of the trend and using buy/sell stops...you have to be ready for whipsaws...ALL the time. I hide my stop loss, I move it way away from the trade...your broker will hit it if he can. Set yourself some 'soft stops' near your trades and if your trade does not recover quickly when it is hit...pull the trade. Often when I know the trade is not good...I will sweat it out until price gets back towards breakeven , and then just close the trade. But it needs to 'recover' from my soft stop first. I will not let a trade move against me for too long...you hear all the time. Small losses can be made up for. And I know indicators lag...The CCI I use for one purpose in this case...When the move is up, looks for dips, buy on dips...that's the name of the game. And when the move is up, I only want to see the CCI in OVERSOLD levels. okay...Also, try some pivot levels on your charts, they are good for s/r...if price is in-between those pivots. It will go up or down to one of those levels...it will, there is no question, it may take some time but it will. You just need to have the direction right. Look here on that Euro/Cad...Note the R1 level at the top of the chart and the Central pivot at the bottom. Price is moving right up to my R1. I want to look for long positions. There are three retracements here (dips) and my CCi is OVERSOLD...this is when I want to get long...(circled in yellow) my buy stops are the little horizontal blue lines. Also look at my grey HA smooth...it barely ever turned white(bearish) a reason the get in long and hold those trades...you should actually look at the HA Smooth as dynamic S/R...just like a moving average. And back testing...it's great but you know when trading in real time, the market will respond to your orders, forward testing is key. That is all I can think of for now.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
One more thing...take a look at what happened after that false break from yesterday (circled in blue)...it made an upward move triggering buys stops then took a lot of them out of the trade with that whipsaw. And then away it went up to R1 resistance. You gotta watch out for this. So I think for 15 min charts, you need to get your entries in deep and take profits pretty quick. Also on this chart...regarding support and resistance. Look at the big pink line. Clear resistance broken on the right side of the chart. Resistance becomes support, price retraces back to it...and then back up to R1. Euro/CAD 15 min

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Lets also take a quick look here back at the bigger timeframe, these are powerful. One way I used this system was to only trade in the direction of the HA smooth color, from the larger timeframe. Here it's grey, or bullish. So on a 15 min frame I would simply only look for long positions. Anyway, I was speculating a buy stop at 1.34 at the time ( solid blue line), and targeting R1...this would have been a good one, and what I would look for in this set-up. Eur/Cad 4 hour.

Hello Brynn007 Waht matters at the end is to make some pips. There is something frequent in trending sistems is the use of a higher tf and lower tf. For example using 1m and 5m, or 15m and 4h etc any combination that can make a better view or using several tf at the same template. I´m looking at this atm. http://my.jetscreenshot.com/2168/m_2...khq4-314kb.jpg I´m short this baby It is making a king of flag lets see how it goes happy pips Alfredo

for confirmed entrys i have put a 5 high 5 low smoothed ma on the chart, only opening the trade when default heiken closes above /below channel, stop at bottom of channel ( long trade ) trailing. exit the trade on colour change of default heiken. this seems to be a nice easy to follow system

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hello Terryberry Interesting idea, please post some charts.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Alfredo...those are pretty good, yeah, post more of those moves. What type of orders do you place? what time frame are those ? I know it's about the pips at the end. I am not trading the system right now so I cannot really post pip counts. I can only speculate with you and probably on bigger charts. But here with the system from late Feb2013 I took a buy trade and hit my 40 pip target 1 and then price kept moving up for more gains. You can see here...its on the screen.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Guys, This is an interesting thread. I have been considering trading with HA bars a lot lately. Why not just trade the H4 or Daily chart - looking only for moves that match the prevailing trend? Wait for a resumption of the trend, enter on the 1st HA bar that appears without a lower wick (for Long entries). Place initial SL below the recent HA reversal candle; trail SL behind each successive HA candle until trade is stopped out. Any thoughts on this? thanks, Bry

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hey Bry...yeah, I think it's a good way to go. I am not working with this one anymore...have been working on simplifying my approach, just price action with a 50 ma. Though, I did use this on the dailys and banked a fair amount of pips. Alfredo may will be working with it, from the thread...though he likes the real low time frames. (Alfredo...cheers bud, I am sorry I haven't gotten back to you on your ideas...will message you) Bryan

--- 帖子 #324 ---
What is the difference between the version of Heiken Ashi Smoothed with the wick and the version without a wick ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Great for trending markets! loose it all in ranging ones.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Which is the System is used in my trading is FTI_Hama System its similar Heiken Ashi indiactor ,but combination of some other systems to findout the market direction &amp; Exactly predict the Market Breakout !

--- 帖子 #327 ---
that "trade made simple" template u use...and youre heiken ashi very lagging you will lose soon

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi Emilnow...the HA smooth with or without the wick is probably the same thing. The wick does not really matter in this case...because the HA smooth really just functions like a moving average. If you are above it you buy, if below you sell. And, trends can be found on any time frame from high to low...just wait for the retracement back into the HA smooth. I used it on the H4 and daily timeframes and it worked ok...but now I trade other styles so it is not so much my thing now. You can also contact Alfredo from above in the thread...he will have some input. Bryn

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Wow this is the place to come if you want to know about Heiken Ashi. Thanks for all the info I read the whole thread and looking forward to following. Basically, I use standard Heiken Ashi candles with a 3 &amp; 5 simple moving average crossover and a Heiken Ashi Oscillator, when I'm looking for entries and exits. When the crossover and oscillator line up that's my trigger. I added the Smooth HA since reading this thread and makes a nice addition. Again thanks to all of you that contributed. Best Wishes and Continued Success Gp

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Cool...glad you like it. I'm thinking to get back to this style on daily charts...buy on dips, sell on pullbacks and never trade against that HA smooth...the HA smooth represents the big money. cheers, Bryn

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I am going to use it on the 1 hour as a confirmation for triggers and see what happens. For some reason I can't upload screen shots I'm not sure what that's about I'll try again tomorrow and see if it changes. Have A Good Night Gp

Nice one...yeah, I like to see the MAs pinch like that in a trend...as the market retraces back into the HA smooth. A trader can add to the position in cases like that. http://screencast.com/t/8D6xWtVLuaf Bryn

Ran with the same pair today. Not quite a pinch but did add to my position. Gotta love those days when everything goes your way

I am new to this forum, however HA crossing HA smoothed looks to have potential. Having read through all the posts, one of the clearest charts I have seen is that posted by Hugh Briss, post 193. Hugh, if you are still around, have you pursued this idea please? If so, what progress? If not, I guess it didn't work as well as anticipated. Thanks. Robbie.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I tried the ha default crossing over the smoothed, with my demo account. Was great when the market was trending but got slaughtered when it was ranging. If anyone is interested I can post the image.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
in the end, this is any other MA system, which works wonders in trending markets, but never will in ranging. So what a trader net at the end of the month if using this system?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Haven't you pointed out the obvious Bataviatrade, really ? It's just like guppy trend trading and multiple moving average trading like the rainbow, or whatever. Buy on dips sell on pullbacks...whatever suits the trader. Also, like any trend trading approach...it's not time frame specific...a pair may be ranging on the H4 but trending quite nicely on the 5 minute, for example. Thanks, Bryn @ Maindoor...if you are reading...yeah, post a chart

Greetings, Swingman, This discussion has been dormant for some time so I hope you receive this query. A few years ago, you posted two indicators in this thread including an haDelta version for smHeikinAshi candles. I didn't find the original haDelta to be very useful for me, but I have discovered some settings for the smHA candles and for your smHA-Delta indicator that initially seem to work beautifully for me. So I have a couple of questions for you: First, you said in a later post that the indies had a small bug in them. I couldn't find a later version, so did you ever post an update to the smHeikinAshi haDelta indicator? Second, could you explain the different parts of your smHA Delta indi (ie, the histogram bars and the 2 lines) and what they are measuring? Finally, would it be possible for you to post the mq4 version so I could encode the settings I use? Many thanks, eyespy Y

Â ADX, if you trade when adx is above 20 level you will avoid chop.

Hello All, Using Heikin Ashi candles, is there any chance someone can code me an EA that takes long positions on a certain color of candle as well as adding to a position if the 3-4 candle is the same color and then close the position when an opposite color candle appears. In addition, I would like the EA to take a short position when the opposite color candle appears, as well as add to the position (same scenario as above) when in a Long position and then close the position when the opposite color candle appears. IF possible when coding, please make all options adjustable. That would be Great! I would be grateful for any additional settings one may want to put in the EA. Best Regards, KingSwing

Hey guys. It's been awhile since I came onto Forexfactory and honestly I'm quite surprised that my account wasn't deleted yet due to inactivity. I would like to apologise for my sudden disappearance from FF, leaving the followers and contributors of this thread hanging. I just got around to reading all the replies. I became busy with what I was doing and went on to join and complete medical school - which is why I couldn't come by or even trade. Thankfully my trading account with my monies is still alive. I will look into this strategy again and post if I am able to contribute something to this. For now, you guys are the masters of this thread still! I have a lot to learn (relearn) about trading again. For all the people who have continued to support and contribute to this thread, thanks a million! Hope to be working with the wonderful people in this thread again! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hey guys, I like this strategy, im going to test it out and let you know my findings
