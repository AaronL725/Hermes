This is a system I have developed and used since 2010 with consistent success. The system is based on the Trading Made Simple (TMS) system, adding my own indicators and trading style. Most of this method is thanks to Eelfranz whose Trading Made Simple (TMS) thread allowed me to be successful at this game of trading. His and Phx62 s posts have helped me realise and develop this way of trading. As requested I have started a new thread so as not to pollute the TMS thread with this variant. I cant always update it but if the interest is there will do so when i can.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Rules:- Trade between London Open and New York close. Take profit is half ADR (Average Daily Range) Works on any pair and any timeframe I personally don't trade below 1HR. Wait for candle to close before making entry or exit decision. Don't enter trade when red news imminent. Entry:- When dot on 4 x Semaphore appears (an alarm can be set) together with a change of APB (Average Price Bar) colour, enter trade in that direction. Confirmation:- After entry check TDI and look for Green crossing Red. If it does, remain in trade and you will likely be in profit. If it does not cross or green bounces off red then its likely trade wont be profitable and exit as soon as you can, in profit if possible or stomach a small loss. Exit:- I exit a)If half ADR (Average Daily Range) is hit, and/or b) if new semaphore dot has formed c) and/or red news is due and/or MACD has changed direction or is level at close of candle level. A++ Trades:- Trade away from yellow semafor sun 3. Enter if candle retraces 50%, TDI crosses or bounces, APB changes colour. Hold until new peak is formed on MACD through 0. That's pretty much it. The more you practice and watch when these dots form the more you will understand price action, support and resistance, trend and other Forex fundamentals. Nobody knows what price will do next but 9 times out of 10 when a new dot forms and price goes the other way it will continue until a new dot is formed. If there is further interest will post some trades when I can and answer any questions. The indicators are all available here or elsewhere on the internet and if you want more on TDI go and check the TMS Trading Made Simple threads here.

Thanks for putting up a new strategy, good luck with it all. I shall tune in when LO, it would be great if you could hook up to Trade Explorer, it may deter people from demanding evidence of your success rate etc....!! Cheers S

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Drewas It sure would help if you posted the Semaphore Indicator. I'm not lazy - I've spent almost an hour looking for it. Found one finally but it looks nothing like yours.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Not sure how to use Trade Explorer exactly, but will look into it.

There you go. I use the default inputs but I think have modified the colours and thicknesses as per image. . Attached File(s) #4X 3 Semafor Alert.ex4 11 KB | 1,761 downloads

To illustrate a little more on EURGBP. I took trade 1 yesterday. I saw new yellow dot with sun around it, saw a change of direction and candle colours change. Entered a sell trade. Notice how the dot formed and then TDI crossed. Experience with this told me to stay in the trade and I did until a new yellow dot formed AND price changed direction with a change of candle colour for 45 pips. Trade 2 (I wouldn't trade at that time)but see dot enter buy trade, TDI cross confirms I made the right decision hold for a potential 15 pips. Would have thought about exiting when red dot appeared and definitely would have exited when bar colour changed and/or TDI crossed other way. Put the indicators up and you will see that on most pairs you get between 1-4 semaphore dots / TDI crosses per day.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Well done on that last trade...If I can use Trade Explorer, anyone can..!!! Thought i would post a chart for all to see, please tell me what you think..AUD/JPY H4 Thinking of going LONG Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers S

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Simply look at your profile page, you will see an invitation at the bottom, just follow the prompts etc...love your charts, cheers S

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Cheers Soccer I personally would take that trade. Why? Because you have a yellow dot with a sun. We are in London session. and there appears to have been a double bottom see previous yellow dot with sun! Experience has taught me that when you get a yellow dot and a sun 9 times out of 10 price will continue up across the MACD 0 line and create a new peak. See previous examples on the same chart. But hey thats just my reading of it theres no certainties in Forex.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hello Drewas, nice system from you. So easy to the eyes to understand and apply. Hope thats the way the pips will come too. Could you post your template?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
This is how my chart looks on that trade Soccer, I would have entered after the yellow dot and sun. Currently appears to be stalling. We still have no cross on the TDI so maybe I would exit but I would now wait for either a new dot to appear in which case ive called it right or if it continues down and the yellow dot with a star repaints then I called it wrong and would get out sharpish.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Drewas, looks pretty cool, did you removed the template and indicators from this thread? regards, Peter

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi thanks I wont post a template because some of the indicators I use are paid for. You can recreate the chart from indicators templates from the TMS web site. PHX's templates are particularly good for this. A big Thanks to him.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Where can one get the indicators for your system? What is the URL for the TMS website? What/Where is PHX's templates?....&gt;Thanks

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Drewas, in what period could the semifor repaint? Could it still repaint after candle close, or next candle close? regards, Peter

--- 帖子 #16 ---
hi drewas, thanks for posting this system.looks good. i use TMS on day charts with some success. would it be possible that can you name the indicators in the template, both free and paid, so we can attempt to recreate the system? from TMS thread i know we need TDI, we all have MACD, you kindly posted the semafor. what other indicators are required? many thanks mate

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Ok bear in mind I work full-time and cant always respond to questions promptly. Indicators and a template will be uploaded to the first post over the weekend. TMS is the Trading Made Simple thread here in Forex Factory started by eelfranz who unfortunately is no longer with us. Phx62 is a trader who posts in that thread and is quite simply inspirational in his clear thinking and consistency. Anyone interested is this system or trading in general should read the whole TMS thread and pay special attention to Phx's trades in particular.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks very much for your advice DREWAS.... I shall try to post a few charts, if you haven't got time to reply, don't worry too much, Whenever a new thread starts, the creator can get swamped with questions and requests, it can get demanding(and annoying for the creator), ... we appreciate your info here and sharing it is brilliant...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
That thread has over 21,000 posts. I'll read them all- see you in 2015.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
There must be something of value there then for there to be so many posts, no?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
No. If a system works and the rules are clearly laid out, there is nothing left to post.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Amen to that! 90% of the posts are complete dribble with most asking the OP to spoon feed them on every possible trade. As billbss posted, if the rules are clear there is absolutely no reason for a thread to contain 21,000 posts. On another note to Drewas - it would be so helpful for those of us learning your system if, in the future, when you post a pic of a trade please eliminate prior to posting it your private indicators. It'll make it so much easier for us to compare our potential trades based on the accessible indicators you are using. Thanx ever so much!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Guys, i have dipped in and out of TMS, I haven't really got to grips with it to be honest. I have been looking on the "TMS for Daily charts" which may suit me better, I have found a summary of posts from an important and respected person, BIG E, special thanks to the person who compiled it all..... hope you find it helpful. Should be attached here, ( go easy with me as this is my first uploaded file,..) Attached File(s) Trading Made Simple BigE (Eric)'s posts.pdf 1.8 MB | 4,138 downloads

I cannot find the abp indicator.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
You can get the indicator here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...05#post4569705

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Indicators and a template are on the first post.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I was exactly the same soccerfan. If you search you will see my posts in various systems here and elsewhere but kept on coming back to the Trading Made Simple method. Eventually realised that I needed to make the TMS method my own and concentrated solely on that system, but needed a less discretional and slightly earlier entry and that's why I use the Semafore indicator and MACD for entry and TDI cross for confirmation. Choose the method that makes the most sense to you add or remove whatever works and practice, practice and practice your method until you can do it without hesitation or conflict.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for the info, DREWAS, i shall stick with your RSS next week in addition to another simple(ish) system that I follow. I shall keep a journal and note the trades on my trade explorer for all to see, a few charts posted will be helpful to others, I believe, Thanks for starting this thread....cheers S

--- 帖子 #29 ---
drewas thanks for posting this system. i am having some success with TMS for day charts. i have a full time day job, do you think this is feasible on daily charts? also you mentioned you trade this around a day job, can i ask what timeframe and trading sessions you use? many thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Sure why not I normally trade 1HR and occasionally 4HR. Seems would work just as well on Days charts, just need to adjust stop losses, take profits and calculate your risk accordingly. Below you had the potential for some 800 pips just on two trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice how after a dot with a sun around it how price continues through the 0 level on MACD through to a new peak. Look back on any pair any time frame it does this all the time. Easy see dot enter, if TDI has just crossed or is crossing stay in trade you will make pips. If price bounces off TDI and/or price goes against you get out (you will lose some trades). Stay in trade until a) you hit take profit (40 - 100 pips on 1HR EUR/USD) and/or b) a new dot forms (a new dot will almost always appear in the opposite direction of the last) and/or c) red news is imminent and/or d) Green TDI hooks over and/or e) MACD stalls or slope goes in other direction. Those two trades had the potential for around 800 pips. Of course I am not saying you would have got that but it is achievable to have taken a slice of the pips on offer with hard work patience and practice.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I trade London session 8am for me to USA close. I trade 1HR, and sometimes 4HR. My favourites pairs EUR/USD, AUD/USD, GBP/USD and EUR/JPY. I choose which pair to trade on which have the lowest spreads and the highest ADR (Average Daily Range) unless I see an A+++ setup. Sometimes I trade out of those hours but only if I see an A+++ setup ie a Semaphore dot with a sun as illustrated above .I cant always check the charts so some days I don't trade at all.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Theres a thousand (probably more) systems here on Forex Factory and some of them are awesome. So this is an attempt to give something back and hope that some people find it of benefit.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I like your level-headed tone Drewas, it makes a refreshing change I have a question - do you look for an entry when you see a sun or a basic dot? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Cheers treguard. I view it like a league table with the dots. Attached Image Warning! Do not use the dots on their own, I use TDI cross, MACD and/or price action for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
That's a nice graphic to reference. Thanks for that! I hope to try out your mix of indicators next week.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
You could trade between suns. Or the peaks of MACD once sun has formed and price has broken the 0. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Higher the peak the better. Truth is no one knows where price is going next indicators and experience can just increase our odds of making pips.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
im trying to load this template on achart as in post1 after installing all the indicators but it keeps crashing multiple broker demos i have tried it on - anybody else having similar experiences? any advice drewas? thanks

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Drewas, would you be happy to share the source code for the #4X Semaphor alert? I would be interested in seeing it. Happy if you want to keep this to yourself.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi I sometimes have a problem with the xADR indicator crashing my MT4. Try loading everything but that indicator. Not sure why that should be just does sometimes. Perhaps someone out there knows?

--- 帖子 #40 ---

Here is an update on the chart from last friday, thanks for the advice on this thread, so far it is up 100 ish pips..!!!!.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) DREWAS... a dot has appeared, should I close now or wait until the candle close...??? Cheers S

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi again, here is another chart for your comments/advice, CHF/JPY H4 Attached Image (click to enlarge) NOTE TO ALL&gt;&gt;&gt;feel free to post your opinions on this chart, that is the way we can all learn,... Cheers S

--- 帖子 #44 ---
For me i will close the trade if the tdi indicator crosses in opposite direction signalling a trend change. The appearance of the semaphor does not mean end as the trade can still go further up as the semaphor repaints

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Ok haven't had a chance to post for a while:- Just closed a nice trade for 38 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered after Red sun and TDI crosses confirming I had made the right decision. Closed when price stalled for 38 pips. I fully expect price to continue down through MACD 0 level to form new peak but cant watch it so exited early.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
So price did continue down only 10 pips in this case. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This pattern though is repeated on all time frames and all pairs. Don't take my word for it though do your own back testing!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Another example from today. Didn't trade this one but you can see that the same thing happens over and over again. Attached Image (click to enlarge) and again! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Couple of more recent examples. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course price doesn't always go up in a straight line (the dots indicator (4 x semaphore indicator) is based on zig zag indicator). You can see though that there is ample opportunity just trading the suns alone.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
The semafor alert Repaints Big Time even on 1 hour......so far in testing...as much as 2 bars, so whoever trades this better pay close attention to the filters!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Is absolutely correct, it does repaint and never use it without other filters or considerations. I don't have GBPAUD on my platform but if you look at MACD and or TDI at the close of each candle you would see no reason to exit. If you had the sun and/or MACD changing slope direction and/or TDI about to cross in other direction and/or a change of bar colour then you might be thinking about entry.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
It seems like you could perhaps find something besides the semafor....just saw it repaint on 4hour bar by 2 bars!! That is just a ridiculously stupid indicator to repaint that badly...sorry, no offense intended!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
No offence taken. Its not my indicator, just one I use. Is it better to use an indicator that repaints and is accurate or an indicator that was accurate two hours ago? Its not for everyone!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
The semafor serves as a visual guide of the trend whether it is a new trend or a retracement and thus can repaint if the trend is still on. You use the tdi as your entry or exit so i do not see the semafor as an issue

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Todays trade:- Don't always trade this pair as it doesn't move much at the moment. Good entry and decent exit made it a good trade in my book. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Is exactly how I use it is a visual guide at any given moment. Used on its own its dangerous used with price action, MACD, TDI and/or support resistance is golden.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Do you have the mql files for #4X 3 Semafor Alert and Synergy_APB? I see there is a mql file for Synergy_APB, but I am not sure if it is the same one you use. Trying to make something for everyone on the thread, a little secret that I am sure you would all enjoy but need the mql files. Let me know. Thanks.

Took a quick scalp kinda against some of my rules but using dots and price action only. Shouldn't really have traded around news (message to self be more careful). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Anyone know any good practical psychological exercises to help prevent exiting a trade too early?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
To manage your trade quietly, use a good size lot. If your are agree, in your head, with the risked money, it'll we be easier for you to manage your trade. You can use different way to manage your position too. Like jesse livermor (made a quick search by google ) Or a way that i aprreciate is to open my position, and whan i reach the R:R = 1 (my profit = my Stop loss), i close an half of my position, let the rest run with out stress!!! after you can move the SL to the BE. It's conservative way, but for me it's the lone way to survive in this wolrd!!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Drewas, i am working on something to see if we exit at the correct time and also anticipate the cross of the tdi. Will post idea and chart later

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Cool don't forget to share because if your not sharing your not caring .

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Drewas, may I know how do you judge and set the Stop Loss? Did you ever try to use Trailing Stop to secure/lock the profit? What is the biggest pip lost you've ever experience using this system? And how about the profit? I'm not so understand what do you mean Average Daily Range? How do you calculate the profit and Stop Lost pip? Thanks for sharing...

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi liewyk, I use an emergency only 50pip stop loss. That's there to protect against a loss of power/internet or large unexpected movement of price. I never let this stop loss get hit and normally will exit a couple of pips in profit or no more than 20 pips against me. I think the max ive lost recently is 30pips. The Average Daily Range is the amount a pair moves in a day. Or at least an average of the amount its moved in the last few days. There are indicators that will calculate that for you. The one I use is xadr on the first post. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Drewas, Thanks for your reply... I tried to use xadr indicator but I don't understand what it is all about... Could you please briefly explain to me how to read the TP and SL? I can see there is RmUp, RmDn, ATR, 5d, 10d, 20d and I have no idea what does it means... Thanks a lot for sharing...

--- 帖子 #70 ---
This might help! Almost anything you want to know about indicators and forex is already in youtube...just do a search, in fact, here is a link for the ATR: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Just closed second trade of the day. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered after green dot and bounce of TDI (sometimes as powerful as a cross), I was confident that price would continue through 0 on MACD and create new peak after White sun yesterday. The TDI repainted many times but there was no reason to exit. Held on and exited at 100 pips. One of my better days trading

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Drewas, As refer to the snapshot below, would you take a sell trade on this pair since there a dot and a sun appeared. But the problem is the green line TDI does not cross the red line yet and besides, if I'm not mistaken that we should trade in between London open and New York close right? Basically New York session has been closed about half an hour ago so we would not recommend to enter this trade? Hi 4xplosion, Thanks for the recommendation video. I'm started to understand what is ATR but could you please explain what does ATR5 and ATR25 means? For example, ATR5=20, does this mean the setup for SL will be 20 pips? Or do I have to multiply anything? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Liewyk, Interesting that you posted a zoomed out pic. I was about to do that to show the way the market moves between the dots. Attached Image I do sometimes trade outside of said hours but only if I see a sun like the one above. You could enter and wait for the cross for confirmation. If price goes against you get out with a small loss or break even. I would consider this a risky aggressive entry. You could wait for the TDI cross and/or a change of direction in the MACD slope and/or a change of candle colour. I would consider that a safer less aggressive entry. Whatever you choose watch what happens to price after a sun.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Sorry for posting this late. I had some internet network problems. This is my idea of entry and exit for the system. The red vertical lines show entry and exit and this makes the trades to be continous i.e as you are exiting a trade you are getting ready to enter another or entering another trade. The OSMA indicator with settings 1 12 9 shows when the tdi is about to cross so you have to get ready to enter or exit. Try it on demo lets compare. Oh i could not upload screenshot to show it and do not know why but use OSMA setting of 1 ,12, 9 with level 0 line

--- 帖子 #75 ---
So why do the dots work so well when trading? This system uses the Semaphore indicator to more easily recognise Elliott Wave patterns. There are great resources here and elsewhere on Elliott Wave theory and fractals and if your serious about trading you should check them out. Attached Image Basically Elliott wave theory says the market moves in waves or zigzags and that these move according to a set of mathematical rules. Consider the chart below a current EUR/USD 1hour chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) See how the dots formed seem to adhere to the previous Elliott Wave diagram. Also notice that the dots between the suns appear to move in a similar fashion.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Just one 30 pip trade today based on previous post. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Oh and look where price went today (albeit slowly). Will it continue down after latest red dot?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Ok end of week and I wont have so much time to post next week. There appears to be lots of people reading my posts and this thread, so would be interested in knowing whether people are finding it of value or not? It takes a surprising amount of time to update and manage this so feedback positive or negative would be grateful. Don't be shy .

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hello and thanks for the great work you've done here Drewas. I have been watching this thread for the past two days and i manage today to make profit with this method ( still in demo ). I took the same position as you on EUR/USD but the yellow dot appeard a candle before so i took a little less pips out. Do you know a way to manage these dots repaints ? Because the yellow dot repaint 2 candles later :s I also took a AUD/USD trade profitable too Keep on going this is a great system and thank you for everything you have done so far Vikendios

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Drewas, Really appreciate your efforts in sharing this system. I just started to study this system two days ago and at the moment, I did trade few pairs and made a bit losses. This is due to my inexperience in this system. I will test for another week or two and will post feedback/comment in here. Could you please explain what does ATR5 and ATR25 means in xADR indicator? For example, ATR5=20, does this mean the setup for SL will be 20 pips? Or do I have to multiply anything? This system work the best with H1 TF? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi Guys , here is an update from the trade/chart CHF/JPY price was 105.07 from previous post...at first it seems like a success but the SUN dot moved along with the price for a few days...!!! It finally moved down price is now 105.84....!!!! What seems like a great trade is not, we will have to be careful and must track some LIVE trades. Happy trading... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Looks like a very interesting thread. If you want to see where the Sun dots were before they repainted use the ZigZagN and make ExtDepth the same value as level 3 on your Semafor. Can someone also explain how the moving averages are used in this strategy? Also I seem to remember something about the importance of the levels 32 and 68 on the TDI but cannot remember what that is. Anyone? Lastly, if like me, you want to practice this over the weekend here is a trade simulator: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=60849

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Dewey,Soccerfan. Thanks for your post. Using your chart above as an example :- Attached Image (click to enlarge) I use the dots as part of my entry only. We can only trade what we see and I use the dot like an early warning that there may be an entry opportunity. If I see a dot I enter in the opposite direction and wait for a confirmation that I have made the right choice, the TDI cross. If I don't get the cross or price goes against me then I exit. If that happens there's a very good chance price will continue in the direction before the last dot formed, repaint and create a new dot (high or low) 1,2 or maybe 5 hours from now. The chart above is viewed in hindsight so the first yellow dot I point to was originally a sun, so according to my plan I would look to enter after the sun and I would have seen a TDI cross and/or a change in candle colour and/or achange in MACD slope. This would have been confirmation that I can make pips from this trade. I am then thinking about exit, I notice that price has moved 6 red bars (I know through experience that they last between 3 and 8 bars normally), I would have seen a hook in the green TDI, a change of MACD slope direction and eventually a change of bar colour to blue. I hope I would have exited the trade before then based of what's happening. Price then continued up eventually creating a new high and a new sun. My original trade was still valid, I still made pips even thought the dots changed and repainted. Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I use the moving averages and the yellow TDI (32 and 68 levels just as another tool to help put the odds of success in my favour (if it helps you use it, if it doesn't don't, simple as ). Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can do this on practically any chart and see similar results. Notice how many times price bounces off the moving averages, coincidentally after dots! So if I see price approach a moving average I am cautious if in a trade or looking for possible entry if not. The yellow TDI also is another tool to help tip the odds a little in my favour. Notice how it vary rarely crosses the 32 or 68 levels and always tries to return to the centre line. So if its around 32 or 68 and a TDI cross (green crossing red) happens then there's a good chance that price will continue back to the centre TDI level. Don't take my word on any of this though, as suggested do your own testing, try the bits of this strategy that work for you and practice, practice and practice some more. You will lose money, you will get frustrated, you will lose sleep but when you start making profits (and you will if you stick at it) its a very rewarding journey and not just financially.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
BTW can anyone recommend a good tool for editing these charts? Using paint takes so long.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Drewas, Does this means if you see a dot (assume you see the dot during a high), then you will trade buy and once you see a confirmation, you will exit buy and trade sell?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Remember I don't base my entry solely on the dot but in essence yes you are right. I have entered a trade based on a dot formation or a continuation trade where a dot has formed several bars back and a TDI cross has occurred but a new dot has not yet formed. That just says to me that 9times out of 10 a new dot (yellow, red or green) will form after the last dot so I am in a trade the right side of movement. How long it will last and whether or not its the next high or low, who knows? I don't. (despite what others say I don't think they do either). What I do know is that if certain things happen I can get in and out with profit. Practice and experience is the only way to learn these things unfortunately. Hope that helps.

Hi Dewey McG, as i can see from the image you've posted, there are an indicator indicating the time of different countries. May I know what is this indicator?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Here you go

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Dewey McG, Thanks a lot for the indicators. Really appreciate it. Could you please explain what does ATR5 and ATR25 means in xADR indicator? For example, ATR5=20, does this mean the setup for SL will be 20 pips? Or do I have to multiply anything? What about RmUp and RmDn? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
That indicator was from the first post. It is used to help calculate TP and SL based on the average daily range for that pair and how far along your pair has already travelled

--- 帖子 #91 ---
What he said .

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Drewas/Dewey McG, Yes I did understand this indicator is to calculate TP and SL but which is known as TP and SL? Hereby I attached a screenshot on AUD/USD pair. Assume that I would like to trade Sell at price 0.92645, what will be the TP and SL for this pair according to the screenshot below?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hello Drewas, i tried uploading charts before but was unsuccessful but now i have succeeded. If you look at the image i uploaded the OSMA with settings of 1,12,9 seems to preempt the cross of the TDI and so can be used for exit and for entry making the system look like a continous trading system i.e if you exit a trade you are looking to enter another. Look at the red vertical lines and test it to see that the OSMA crossed the zero line to signify exit of a trade and wait for entry of cross of TDI

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Liewyk. Based on the chart posted (and there appears not to be a lot of it), I would be looking for an initial TP (Take Profit) target of around half the ADR value according to above about 50 pips (half the first ADR=106 number). My personal SL (Stop Loss) would be 50 pips from entry. Hope that answers that for you?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Nice work and thanks for posting that. Will have a look at it and do some testing.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Looks interesting, but I wouldn't use it on it's own. There are times when the OSMA crosses over and the TDI does not, but bounces off instead. Where it might prove useful is for gauging the strength of the cross by the size of the bar crossing over. Worth looking at.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Good start to the week. Broke a lot of my rules to take this one but worked out ok. I took it at that time purely because EURJPY moves so much at this time of day. I also didn't see a clear cross of TDI. Almost exited there and also two candles later when Sun formed first and price stalled. Held on because I didn't see a change of bar colour (still red). Closed two candles later happy and a little relieved to have got 50 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note to self: be more careful and less risky.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi all, there seems to be a lot of good things going on in this chart....USD/JPY H4....swing low, pin bar, macd, tdi to cross will make it a great chart..!! Here is the chart with a vertical line to indicate a BUY trade, Attached Image Let's see how this one goes.....

--- 帖子 #99 ---
The OSMA is just to exit a trade and also for you to look forward to cross of the TDI. So the entry is the cross of the TDI and exit is cross of OSMA above 0 line. Thats the idea

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi lets look at the chart you posted. I didn't trade this (in fact I didn't trade at all today) but based on the charts yours and mine:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) I would have entered as soon after the sun stalls, there's a slight change in the MACD slope and TDI appears to have crossed (just) so I would stay in the trade. The next candle started red but turned blue I would maybe be thinking of exiting hopefully having bagged some pips around 30 are on offer at that stage. I think and hope according to my plan that because I haven't seen a new dot form, price will either go on up and form a new dot in which case my analysis on the next candle would start again. It may also and maybe more likely continue down, given its done so for the last couple of days in which case I would try and bag some pips now and see if it breaks the sun level and I would then exit. Hope that outlines my thinking when trading. Of course its easier after the event, but that's what I strive for on each trade.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Zooming out I've seen these patterns before somewhere. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe it will give us a clue as to where price MIGHT go? Attached Image Lets see tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Wow called it right. Now around 80 pips in the direction I called it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Wish id traded it now

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Drewas, Referred to the screenshot below, I traded buy at the second candle bar as the TDI crossed, MACD changed direction and the candle bar changed color after the sun and dot appeared on the previous candle bar. The question is, I should exit when the candle bar changed color and/or TDI crossed and/or MACD changed direction again?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Can you please share the indicator drawing red/blue support/resistance dots on the graph? Because sometime dots doesn't show up and these lines can be good profit or re-entry targets. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I rather say red/blue dotted lines on the graph. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi hoperich, Here you go...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks so much for your quick response and indicator liewyk. Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Liewyk, Sorry for the slow response don't have a lot of time to trade this week. Looking at your chart I probably would have entered a buy after the sun formation if it weren't for the time of day and/or the small candle sizes. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If I had entered a buy I probably would have lost some pips or broke even at best (price did move 18 pips up before breaking the S&amp;R level to continue down). You cant win them all but given a sound exit strategy and experience on the charts you can minimise losses when you do lose.

hi drewas good concepts i am currently testing on multiple time frames are you able to tell me if its possible to get rid of the Sonic R System FFCAL Headlines Box? if so how ? i follow the news closely so i prefer not to have it there...

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi Drewas, I've a bunch of questions here... Hehe... Please do refer to the attached images... 1. AUD/USD - Should I enter a buy trade or wait for the next candle bar to turn blue? The dot and sun is formed, green line is crossing the red line but it is moving downwards and MACD has not yet change direction. 2. EUR/JPY - I've entered a sell trade as the dot and sun is formed where green line is crossing red line as well as MACD changed direction. On the third bar after the dot and sun was formed, it changed to blue bar where the green line seems moving upwards and MACD changed direction, should I exit? I did not exit and I'm losing 70 pips on my demo account. 3. GBP/USD - Should I enter a buy trade or wait for the next candle bar to turn blue? A dot is formed and the green line is crossing red line but is moving downwards as well as the MACD is still under 0. 4. USD/JPY - I've entered a sell trade as the dot and sun is formed (referred to the attached image as the dot and sun keeps on repainting), green line is crossing red line and MACD is changing direction. The question is, the next candle bar after the dot and sun is formed changed from blue bar to red bar (which is good since I'm trading sell trade) but then within the same period, it changed back from red bar to blue bar. Should I hold it or exit this trade? As you can see from the attached image, it keep on repainting after my trade. At the moment I'm still holding it and losing 50 USD on my demo account. Hope that you can guide me... Thanks a lot Drewas...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Drewas, Thanks for sharing your system. It looks like you take both trend &amp; counter trend trades? Also, what moving averages are you using? Thanks for your help. snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Snarly, I do take into account the trend but if I see a strong setup am happy to go against it. I use 200 EMA, 800 EMA, 100 EMA, 10 EMA and 24 EMA.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Thanks Drewas, For you quick response this Saturday night (my time). Nice system by the way, I'll give it a go Monday. snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Just happened to be at my computer. Was 5am UK time.Don't sleep much these days (probably something to do with trading)

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hey Liewk, Apologies for being slow responding:- 1. No buy for me on that one. TDI has just crossed. MACD is going down and although you have a sun your around US open one of the busiest times so unless your alredy in a sell trade then your waiting for next blue candle close and/or a MACD change of direction and/or a TDI hook. 2. That looks like a trade that's gone against you despite the sun I would have (hoped) to be out before 70 pips against me. One of the hardest things in this games is admitting to yourself that you were wrong and exiting. EUR/JPY moves a lot very quickly so best trade that one with caution. 3 + 4 You've got the dots but nothing to tell me theres a change of direction wait till close of candle and for next to see if there's a valid entry. Hope that helps .

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Classic trade for me today price changed direction at London open and entered sell after Sun and TDI cross. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Held until price hit 200 EMA and stalled with green TDI hook. 45 pips.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Drewas, May I know why my TDI is different from yours? May I know what is the exact TDI indicator that you use?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Slightly different. Dots and suns mostly in the same spots? Which broker you with Liewyk I am with Fxpro ? May account for the differences.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Drewas, I'm using ThinkForex broker... Drewas, may i know when you will exit a trade? Is it once a new dot is formed? What if new dot is formed but the TDI isn't crossing opposite direction? For example, you are buying EUR/USD, give a scenario below what action you will take? Hold or Exit? 1. A new dot is formed on the third bar but the green line ain't crossing downwards and the bar does not change from blue to red. 2. A new dot and a sun is formed on the third bar but the green line ain't crossing downwards and the bar does not change from blue to red. 3. A new dot is formed on the third bar and the bar has changed from blue to red but the green line ain't crossing downwards. 4. No dot is formed on the third bar but the bar has changed from blue to red. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
hi drewas testing still i noticed the sun can repaint as far as 24 bars on the hourly chart! but as you said...the indicator is allowed to repaint as long as we know how to trade it after-all its only an indicator and PA is king a trade that i entered and learnt from below:

--- 帖子 #124 ---
a trade on the 15min chart entered at 1.536 currently sitting at 1.534 just moved my tp after the screenshot as price was moving strongly edit: took profits as USD news was near....news is positive for USD so it will probably make new lows but sticking to the rules means not news...i already ran it too close to the news.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks for sharing this system with us Drewas. My first attempts using it on my demo account have turned out to be rather succesfull. Do you think that checking on the exactly previous timeframe and seeing whether all the conditions have been met can work as an additional confirmation for entering a trade or even exiting it before it's too late?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Drewas, This may sound like a strange request, but would you post images of a few proper trades that did not work out? I find that acknowledging when a method fails is instructive for a number reasons. Most posts by the thread administrator show successful trades but never failures. My request is not to show evidence that it does not work but to acknowledge when proper trades go against expectation and then what to do about it -- possibly how to avoid it, but more likely to acknowledge that it happens.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Funny you should request that. I had a trade today that went wrong. Its been the first bad trade I've had in a while and was totally my fault for not waiting for close of candle. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I saw the sun at the arrow and entered a sell trade. It went for me about 15 pips then reversed and the candle closed up. I made the mistake of entering the trade halfway through the bar about 20 mins into it and it looked certain to continue down but didn't. My punishment is im not allowed to trade again today . Lesson learnt. Typically a few bars later price changed direction and went down 30 odd pips (should have been mine ). That's trading.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Glad its working for you. I don't use higher timeframes personally but whatever works for you works so...

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Looks like you got out at the right time maybe could have held on for another couple of bars but hey you got out with a profit better than me today .

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Drewas, Waiting for your reply of my previous post... Thanks a lot ya...

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hey Liewk, I have said right from the off never use the dots on their own. They are a guide, if a dot forms AND you have either a TDI cross AND/OR a MACD slope change AND/OR a change of bar colour AND/OR. How many parameters are up to you I find the more that align the better my success rate. 1 No exit. 2. No exit 3. Would consider exit. 4. Strong exit. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Consider the chart below for nearly two weeks. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at the TDI we can see that daily theres between 3 to 5 crosses or bounces of the TDI (ie green off red). Normally two between London and US close. How does this help us. Well its all about improving our odds of success. You can do this simple exercise on any pair and this will be another tool to help tip the odds of success in your favour.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
What about the pair I failed miserably on today Attached Image (click to enlarge) Well we can see recently that even in a fairly strong down movement there were 4 to 5 TDI crosses with normally 2 during London open and US close. Even if you traded with the trend your surely going make pips using this system.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
In your first post you mention waiting for the candle color to change before entering. Here you say you didn't wait for the candle to close. Have you adjusted your thinking on that point? You know what, I just read your post about the multiple AND/OR options to enter or not. No need to reply unless you want to. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
There's no absolutes that I've found trading but had I waited for the candle to close and looked at the MACD I would have seen it continue up (albeit slightly) and am pretty sure I wouldn't have sold there. I suppose had I waited for the candle to close and it continue down (like it did a few bars later) it would have been a safer trade but have missed out on a few pips. Hey am clearly still learning to get the discipline needed for this game .

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Drewas, Refer to the image below, would you take a buy trade? Dot and sun is formed, green line already crossed upwards few hours before the sun is formed, so assume that MACD is going to change direction to up and the candle bar is going to change from red to blue, will you take a buy? The question is lies on the TDI since green line already crossed red line prior to the sun forming, and assuming the green line will bounce off the red line, will you take this trade immediately?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Drewas, Refer to the image below, will you consider a buy trade? Dot and sun is formed on previous candle. Current candle bar is still having a red bar but the green line is already crossing the red line as well as MACD changed direction.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Drewas, Once the dot and sun is formed, do we always have to wait for the next candle bar in order for us to make a trade? What if once the dot and sun is formed, green line crossed red line, MACD changed direction, as well as the current bar has changed color, can we immediately take the trade? Thanks a lot...

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hey Liewk, Guess its personal preference I personally try to wait until I am certain that a change has occurred and normally that's what I look for. No trades from me today didn't have time.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hello Drewas, thanks for sharing your system. I tested it for a couple of weeks, did mistakes, hopefully learned from them to become more efficient. But there are still mistakes that I cannot explan like this one : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Could you please explain me how I could have prevent this kind of failure ? I feel like there is something that I am not monitoring properly. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Lensok, Not sure its possible to prevent losing a trade. Only minimise the loss when you do. Looking at your chart price had been in a steady climb all day (the last three days actually) so I would have been extra careful about trading against that. Your right though that it meets a lot of the rules of the system. Dot then TDI cross, MACD change of direction. It is late in my trading hours and particularly on a Friday when volume is stopping. Also If you look at a 1hr chart there was no candle colour change which if I was trading at that time I hope would have kept me out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Other than that sometimes you just have to say it didn't work and look for the next trade. There's plenty that do.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
One trade today:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered sell once price broke support level. Held on until sun and TDI cross for 40 pips.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Lensok Only my 5 cents. A clear uptrend was established. A series of Higher Highs and Higher Lows. In that instance it is better to take the signals for a long trade. Support was to close for comfort. Don`t know that moving aveage 5EMA ? that appears on your chart but it acted as support all the way up.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Haven't traded for bit. Took one earlier today :- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered after dot and TDI cross. Held when price retracted from new dot and TDI hooked for 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Does anyone use the sun indicator aka #4X 3 Semafor Alert.ex4 indicator on the daily timeframe? It seems like most are using it on the H1 timeframe. Also I know the sun repaints, is there a certain amount of candles it stops repainting? In other words after a full sun appears with red or white trim around it, after 2, 5, or even 10 candles do I have to worry about repainting?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Anyone have any good experience with the non repainting indicataor tried it, not sure what to think yet.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi drewas thnx for sharing your system im just wondering have you done any backtest with your system? possible to show the chart

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Drewas I have been using same semafor indicator One thing everyone should know red sun or white sun is highest high for that particular time.It does not mean it can't go higher or lower. I understand that is why you have TDI and MACD for confirmation. Well done cheers

--- 帖子 #149 ---
this repaint issue keeps popping up all over FF Semafor is basically calculating Highest High for that particular TF and since price is in constant movement "repainting " is necessary to reflect new HH So in my opinion repainting issue is misguided.Just look at the price.Has it made higher High? or LL then you will know your answer without even semafor regards

--- 帖子 #150 ---
You said it repaints based on what TF you select. Is this done daily? So it will repaint the new high for a 1H chart on a daily basis or until the next high or low since that last one? If it is since the last one and you put on D1 chart it may not repaint for many weeks or even months, if it is like this. Why are there no new full sun painted where the red arrows are? These are all new HH since last painted red sun. If you say because "maybe it was there than it repainted to where the red run is now" than the question is why did the first full red sun stay? and why is the second one staying, but not the full suns where the new HH is on where the red arrows are? Anyone question this indicator? Just wondering looks like it would be a great indicator, just trying to figure out how this works exactly. Many thanks for your input.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Davit Couldn't have put it better (and clearly didn't earlier ). The indicator changes just like the market changes, for me its a guide to keep me the right side of a trade. Those who says it repaints so I wont use it. Are you using an indicator that was accurate and gave you a signal 1, 2, 10 or 20 bars ago? Things have changed since then.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Drewas, I don't mind the repainting trust me, I think this is a great indicator just trying to make sense of how it works. Any help would be great to my previous post. Many thanks and much respect.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
drewas is it possible to post your entry with a chart on it before the price moves ? thnx

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi ForexBuster, I will try and post one. I don't trade every day and when I do its whilst doing a proper job so I don't always have time to trade and post at the same time. I have a trade open at the moment I entered at the TDI cross on EUR/USD earlier this morning. 31 pips up at the moment.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
thnx for your response drew I understand you got a busy schedule but is it possible you just tell us what price you took that trade on that day and then when you have time can you post your chart where you took the trade and why you took the trade pls.. thnx in advance whats the TP and Sl you use ?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Does anyone have a post to #151? I am just curious how this indicator works and it has not been discussed on here. Wondering why I am the only one asking here. Any thoughts would help. This is very similar to zig zag indicator.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi Doctor, I believe there are no suns because the move up isn't complete. Draw lines between the suns and you will have your answer or your zigzags . Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I think it does. Thanks for your help. If you take the weak suns out, this is an exact replica of the zig zag indicator. Looks good.

Hi Drewas, What setting do you use for Heiken Ashi? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Just the default ones.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi just want to comment that trading should be looked upon not just mechanical way but holistic approach.What do I mean by this? Ok overall trend on Aussie has been down for months.That is dominate trend.Within this dominate trade we got corrective waves or retracement because price rarely goes flat down or up. You happened to buy top of the move close where supply is waiting with their limit shorts. So understanding basic concept of Price Action will help you to discriminate when to take a trade irregardless what indicators tell you.Indicators only add slight edge but you are the driver and you make the call. Trading is subjective and that is why identical trading system can be both profitable and unprofitable depending how one applies it. Anyway good luck.I am going to upload nice S/R pdf for you to read.It will help you.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Continued. Hi Drewas Not hijacking this thread but wanted to share few basic ideas.I hope you don't mind. When one clicks on system section there are literally hundreds of them some over 10000 posts and most retired to collecting dust. Why is this phenomena so common?Answer is most of these systems are mechanical and take the trader out of it and assume mechanical signals are good signals and profitable...Well if they were profitable then why did they all basically die out.Answer is simple.They were not profitable and could not be as long as pilot is flying the plane with eyes closed... Trading is simple and complex same time.Simplicity is reached after understanding its complex components and players involve. Could a mechanical system predicted what happened on weds Carney's speech?Not the slightest. Should you be aware of news,fundamentals?Absolutely and it should be daily ritual. News and why that could effect what your indicators are telling you. Best analogy to me is being in plane high above and then zero down for a kill after clearly seeing the terrain and booby traps. I mean TOP down approach 1.News 2.Momentum (trend direction and liquidity factor) 3.Price in relation to S/R,round numbers,fib levels 4.Your mechanical signals in relation to above 5.Trade taken when everything fits in.

So took another trade on GBPUSD Waited for price to move up from the green dot, ignored the two 'indecisive' small candles and entered above blue candle once it closed&gt; MACD closed up and TDI crossed. Have held it and momentum increased and have exited from 32 pips. Attached Image Exited early, but happy with 32 pips.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi, sorry for possible stupid lazy question but what does it mean when there is a sun around the semiphor?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
It means there is a change of direction with a strong chance of it becoming longer term. Red, green and yellow dots show change of direction generally for smaller periods. I use them as an early warning and then use TDI cross and/or MACD level change for confirmation of trade. Some people trade between the Suns. If you get a sun AND a TDI cross you will make pips. Always trade away from the last dot. Best thing to do is pop the indicator on a chart and watch what it does. Is a big help in seeing waves and being on the right side of a trade. It does change (or repaint as some say) but thats not an issue for me. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks for reply. Ive stuck it on my 5min charts with 100lwma. Looks great for pullback with-trend trades and perhaps counter trend trades if there is a sun and divergence. Will have a play tomo.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
So an update on yesterday trades to show how Semaphore indicator 'repaints':- Attached Image So yesterdays high (sun) has been replaced with a red dot and a new high (sun) has been reached around Frankfurt open. The signals are still valid and had I held my trade yesterday over night would have reached 60 odd pips. Entering after todays sun (at the TDI cross and after the candle change to red) would have bagged you around 30 pips and counting. If the move continues it should go through the 0 on MACD for some further pips. Attached Image What do you know it carried on through 0 on MACD. Now how far it will go? To the blue 100 moving average? maybe. Attached Image Helped by news but got there! Am I a genius no. This happens all the time just look back at charts and you will see. Wish I had taken the trade now.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I didn't take above trade today I am in on EURAUD:- Attached Image Entry at close of first red candle and currently 90 pips. Waiting for a reason to exit. A more aggressive (riskier) entry would have been at close of yellow dot candle for extra pips before the TDI cross / candle colour change.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Possible setup on AUDUSD? Lets see if candle closes red. Attached Image Price stalled around 800 EMA, red news and New York open soon so what would you do? Decided against it due to red news. Will see what happens after.

Hi I haven't had any issues with the semaphore indicator and i run on a fairly modest laptop (Celeron Processor, Windows 7, 4GB RAM). I have always had issues with the adr indicators slowing or crashing Mt4. The one posted a couple of posts back has proven to be the most reliable. I may re-add the indicators to the first post as there has been an MT4 update since they were originally posted.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Might want to try :- Attached File(s) 3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_v2 600+.mq4 12 KB | 587 downloads Appears to be the same just using numbers instead of the suns. Logic looks the same will have to see how it performs live. see below:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will test it in the next couple of days please let me know if this improves performance.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
It surely did improve performance. I also added back the adr and news indicators too. Still not lightning fast, but fairly good. Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Drewas, thanks for this system. And thanks for the separate thread - not cluttering the TMS thread. My question: Would it be possible to have a dashboard like arbinkla`s TMS monitor? It would be nice to have one dahsboard showing the selected pairs and their status in different timeframes. The status signal might show red for no condition met, yellow for all but one (TDI?) met, green all conditions are fullfilled. Regards

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Any good setups today Drewas? Thanks for your integrated system with TMS, I have been making losses for the past few years, hope this system will make a change in my life. Thanks for all the postings.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Add anything that makes it work for you. Personally i check for high ADR and low spreads and this takes a few minutes every day.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Waiting for TDI on GBPUSD to cross fully. Next hour maybe will it continue down after yesterday who knows! Someone said trading is just waiting. Attached Image Only advise is to stick with it. I lost money for several years before finding the TMS method and adjusting it so it worked for me.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Do you intend to go short or long? I ask because of the last green dot....

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi Lucariga I didnt trade today. Was fortunate enough to make enough yesterday so i could have a day off. Had I traded i would hope to have done something similar to the attached that followed my rules:- Attached Image Trade 1 :- Would enter after pink 200 ema and break of last candle in opposite direction. Although the green dot had formed it was only on first candle. Given that it was London open (when new money comes into the market) also APB bars normally run for 3 to 8 bars in one colour, TDI crossed (theres often 2-4 crosses per trading day). Price moved for three candles down some 40pips which i hope i would have captured some of. Trade 2 :- Entry after sun formed and TDI crossed at break of new candle colour. Again there was 38 -40 pips as price moved three candles up. Again if i were trading I would have hoped and expected to grab a few pips from that.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks So to summarize, after a dot appears, you enter on the breakout of the "dotted" candle if the TDI is in agreement otherwise you wait for the TDI to cross in your direction. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yep, normally if you get a new high or low (dot) and price reverses from that hi or low (dot) you will normally get two or three candles before new high or low (dot) forms. So I am then looking for entry. Of course that high or low (dot) can continue in that direction eventually becoming a new hi or low (sun) several candles later. If however the dot forms and im in a trade its like a warning that price will change direction sooner rather than later. My exit rules then kick in and I look for a reason to exit (price stall, change of bar colour, MACD, TDI hook etc). Hope that makes sense. It does in my head .

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Lets look at GBPUSD again:- Attached Image We've seen a sun form and price move up and touch the blue 100 moving average. Will it go beyond that probably based on what normally happens after a sun forms. It goes on to create a new MACD peak! You could have re-entered after TDI green bounced off red and I would expect price to go a little further despite it being late on a Friday. Lets see. Attached Image Ok so called it wrong. Did move up some 25 odd pips and would have moved my stop to break even which would have resulted in a small loss or break even trade. Perhaps price will continue up to the new MACD peak next week. Will have to see. Wont have so much time to post next week (i work full-time also). Hopefully posting some of my trades and thought process has helped some people!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi Grewas, i have the "3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_v...mq4" indi installed on my charts but dont get the sun only a circle with a no3 in it . Any ideas, many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Yep same indicator with slightly different display yellow with 3 in it replaces suns on the 4x indicator. Logic is the same and performs in the same way. I posted it as some people had a problem with the original indicator. The one you have was programmed in the newest MT4 and so seems quicker to calculate and less prone to causing MT4 to stall or crash.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks Drewas for explaining, will copy the one from your 2st post and give that ago, any issues will revert to the new 1. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi Drewas nice system. So it is like you outlined it you dont consider the trrend so mutch you just go after the suns and to confirm it ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi i do consider the trend and am cautious entering against the trend unless there is a sun. There should be space to get a decent profit (half ADR) until it hits support and resistance or the MA's I use. Attached Image Am in on EURGBP for 10pips at the moment. Entered after orange 1 based on the 3 (or sun) creating a new peak.Entered a little late but TDI cross and MACD new peak being formed. Shooting for 25-30 pips half ADR.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Ok how do you define trend ? by indicators or price action if you have time please show on a chart. Also another question i cant find in this thread, what is your winning rate how many trades out of 10 do you win ? And what is your winning compares to the losers ? that is how many pips do you get on your winners and how many pips do you lose on your losers ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Zoomed out Attached Image Trend is subjective but for me zoom out and you can see that after purple 2 price has resumed downwards. There is a 3 on 4 hour chart but enough space to hit my take profit. Will see. I don't trade every day/week but made 300 pips last week trading every day as I was off.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
ok thanks 300 pips in how many trades? for me percent is more intresting then pips. best regards

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I never trade more than two trades per day.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Out for 5 and a half pips as its retraced. Should wait for candle close but cant always get the 100pip run and its lunch time! Attached Image Besides can always re-enter if USA comes on and it continues down.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
So entered after pullback after break of last red candle and just before TDi cross:- Attached Image TDI crossed and red dot formed:- Will it go to blue 100MA? Currently 7 pips. Attached Image Dont normally trade this pair as AD is usually quite low in comparison.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
So didnt go so well that one:- Attached Image Out at break even!After TDI green hook and candle retrace. Note to self: Stick to higher ADR moving pairs.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
i am also trading this on demo and i only take number 3 in trading and if no news to be released relatively soon on the pair i'm looking at.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Got another question Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the attached chart once i enter (green dotted line) i c a red two small candles and also a another red semaphore. But those were very two small red candles. but after those two red candles price seems to go further. Anyway i have seen lots these situations before. In such a situation would you have closed the trade either after the semaphore or the red candle or waited since those are very small candles? And whos the broker you are using ?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Personally that trade is a bit early for me I look from London where bars tend to be bigger, but I would have exited for break even or a small loss then maybe re entered after the green dot and close of first blue candle indicating that the move will continue up:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hindsight is a wonderful think but we can se that price continues up to form new peak on MACD. It does this all the time, but dont take my word for it. With this knowledge you might have held on for the new peak and be in the pips!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
This looks like a counter trend trade and the only reason why you take it is becaouse of the 3dot that is a strong signal and after that also the other indicators confirm and make you stay in the trade yes ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yes I use the dots as a visual guide, if im trading away from yellow dot or sun then its a strong indicator that price has changed direction and will continue through 0 on MACD to create new high. Of course its doesn't always do this sometimes it will reverse and continue beyond the sun or yellow dot but you will almost always capture some pips using my exit rules. If it continues to new MACD high then these are the 'home run' trades.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Why are there no activity here ? no one post questions or chats of trades ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Elway....I'm new to the post but I just wanted to add that if you get rid of most unnecessary indicators that you don't need and other possible programs running on the lap top, then this should improve the RAM. How are you doing with this system using the Semaphore? Doing well? Is your account real? Thank you for any response if you feel free and have the time.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I trade this method everyday but am not a full time trader and so cant always post as I have work commitments too. The system is very simple and (hopefully) articulated in this thread in a simple and helpful manner. The rules don't change nor the indicators (unless theres newer versions) so there not much else to post. I've posted in realtime to show my thinking and others have benefited so mission accomplished !

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Yes, Drewas, mission accomplished. Well done. Still some questions remain. For example: Anybody has traded this on D1? Thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Go to Tools / Options / Charts and change the max bars in history and max bars in chart. I trade 5M charts so I use 2100 bars, but if you are trading 1M charts, you might need more because there are 1440 bars in a day. I chose 2100 because at one time I used modified MACD indicators and would set Signal to 2000 so it would match the zero line as an alert. Habit now, lol. Anyway, less bars = faster MT4. I haven't seen that star semaphore in years, lol, but yes it is a resource hog. I do not know if the next version is better? My team cut up a version years ago and now it has no effect on your computer. The signals have absolutely nothing to do with anything, lol, but I have been using it for so long it is habit now. If you draw trend lines it can be handy as you can quickly connect old highs and lows. Otherwise, it is pretty meaningless but for absolutely no reason, I use it as a tool for pseudo market position. I probably have different settings too?? so you may need to adapt it. Perhaps if you use diagonal trend lines after a signal and then trade until the next dot and look for a trend line break to exit, it might be effective. The only problem is if you get whipsawed you will need to be fast. On the other hand, you could only trade the pink 2 and yellow 3. During a deep trend, you will have some weak reversals as the yellow 3 keeps resetting, but if you are diligent and committed to the trend lines, you might actually profit from it. Of course you will probably give it all back in consolidation, but if you can find a good enough filter, it might work out. Anyway, just an idea of how semaphores might be used. For anyone unfamiliar, the semaphore indicator is the zigzag with a number that pops up to show highs and lows. Just as the zigzag constantly adjusts, so does the semaphore indicator.

Bottom!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
One question....Do you exit trade when green or red dot appear? Also do you exit trade when APB change color?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I dont exit when green or red dot appears. I exit when target has been reached and/or TDi hooks, and/or bars change colour and/or price goes against me too much. Always my goal is not to lose pips.

Hi, Drewas. I have enjoyed reading your thread. I notice the thread had stopped for a while and now it is resumed. Glad to see you are still using this system. It can help give the rest of us confidence in a system if we see the system is reliable over a long period of time. At least that is how I feel anyway. Do you think the pac indicator a necessary part of the system, because it wasn't part of the original rules that I can see? And could this system be traded on perhaps the 5 or 15 minute charts as well? Or maybe the 30 minute? Or is only one hour what you have found is best? Thank you for your kind reply.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi glad your getting something from the thread. The PAC seems to help with patience ie waiting for price to leave or close above/below the PAC. Is not fundamental to the system just something that seems to help me. I have been trading this pretty much the same way since before the thread started. I work also and so dont always post. I trade almost every day and normally 1 to 2 trades per day. I started posting again when asked if i still traded this way. Once you get it down the system is easy and profitable. I just tweak every now and then. try out different indicators, take profit levels, money management plans etc. I do try other systems but keep coming back to this as my bread and butter.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Is that a different semafor indicator that you are using now, Drewas, than you were using at the beginning of the thread?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Yep old one kept crashing once MT4 upgraded. Newer one is here :- http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...38#post8100038

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hey, Drewas, I am just wondering about something, as I am sure a lot of traders are asking themselves ... Will this strategy, if a trader is successful at it, produce enough pips, if traded daily, to allow a trader to trade full time with no other job? Thank you !

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Do the maths yourself. Ive posted trades and results and shown trades in realtime on this thread. I personally shoot for 50 pips a day. Sometimes I lose , sometimes I get 20 pips sometimes I get 100 pips. I guess every traders circumstance is different. I enjoy trading but couldn't do it full time I would miss what my full time jobs gives me (not just money). I didn't start trading to get rich but to supplement my income, learn more about myself and financial markets.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Trade on AUD/USD. Entered at break of LO candle waited because of long wick other way initially showing indecision? New peak formed on MACD after yellow sun, yellow TDI angled down and ADR close to daily usual so quite risky. Attached Image Up around 10 pips at the moment.

In China,Shenzhen,near Hongkong,40 pips a day,800 pips per month,is only enough for one single people live.

First of all thanks for your contribution here! So, do you normally hold a trade through red news? I was in the same trade and closed just before for 11 pips... Also, when a trade goes against you, do you wait for the sour candle to close (leaving a hook, opposite candle etc) or do you close "on the fly" at max 20 pips or so?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Sometimes, depends on news and whats gone on. Today i took a chance that paid off other days would have hit my stop loss that today was at breakeven. I sometimes close a trade before the hour if price has retraced over 50% (like yesterdays eur/usd trade). Normally am taken out by take profit target or trailing stop loss.

Hey Panisko i notice you use the old indicator I had problems with newer builds of MT4 and that one. It needs quite a lot of power to calculate, The one i use at the moment is 3_Level_Zz_Semafor_v2 600+ (is in paperclip). Also found that reducing Max bars in history and Max bars in chart can improve performance of the charts particularly if you trade multiple charts/pairs. Attached Image

Nevermind i've found it! So... How's everyone's trade history been looking like with this system!?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
However, you also mentioned getting out at more than a 50% retrace (of what exactly?), color change, hooking TDI and a "soft" SL of about 20 pips - all of which appear to have happened here. It makes all the difference whether we are in profit at that point or not I guess.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Have you thought about the importance of a trader (Drewas in this case) sticking to a system, almost unchanged, for about 5 years?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
A 50% or more retrace or more usually is early indication that next candle is changing colour. The larger the candle the more likely the change. See todays EURJPY as example. Attached Image Of course theres no guarantees and theres nothing to say next candle wont continue up but its all about putting odds in your favour and cutting short losses.

New trade. Entered away from Yellow sun. No TDI cross but was confident because the daily average was almost exhausted and price always goes to new MACD peak after yellow sun.

Good morning Drewas, for me it's hovering around +10, also long EU (a bit of a strange hedge for now) - missed the nice GU one...

I have a similar set of pending order shorts on NU h4 wtg to trigger. I use the semaphore and TMS Osc Histogram in the lower window (which is found in the Trading Made Simple thread) instead of TDI, which does a similar job for me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also short on USDJPY entered just after cross new MACD peak hopefully.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Closed for break even. Frustrating today time for an espresso or two!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
We can quickly see that going short is essentially c/t on UJ when we look at the daily chart semaphor for example. That means I would be cautious on any intraday short signal for instance and any short trade for that pair I would be setting my target levels half of what I'd normally set. The safest option of course is always to trade in the direction of the daily semaphore signal when trading intraday. The daily chart attached visually emphasises that hopefully. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Progressing well enough to allow me to reduce my s/l levels now. Limited risk at this point but not yet taken any profit, and TP1 has still yet to be hit so I'm not cheering for now. If tp1 manages to be achieved, then I will adjust stops on remaining 2 position to b/e and get into free trade territory, which is always my objective when trading...but the market will decide one way or the other as always.

Classic entry at London Open, TDI cross away from yellow sun moved stop early to break even will see if its got any legs given its Bank holiday here in UK. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Went for UJ instead but closed it for -8 - EJ looks better...

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Be aware that it is effectively a c/t trade though according to the D1 chart, which may still work out ok but I'd be looking to take what I can in your shoes and exit if I had taken the short on. Personally, I prefer to wait for a long signal to appear off of the h4 or h1 chart and trade in line with the underlying daily semaphore rather than swim against the tide, but that's just me.

Closed earlier for 40 pips. Reduced TP due to bank holiday. Took a long time to get there!.

Landline I trade 1H and occasionallly 4H and try to trade higher ADR pairs. Experience has taught me that I can make profits this way. Your method appears to be completely different using different indicators and time frames. Different strokes for different folks I guess.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
The method I use is along a similar principle to yours actually regarding the semaphore, which is my prime indicator telling me where dynamic support and resistance is. Thereafter I've simplified everything, keeping only what is necessary on my charts to trade in line with the daily semaphore. Any indicators in the lower window are always of secondary importance to me and are used more to support what price is already telling me on the main chart. As you say....different strokes etc

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Perhaps you could post your indicators and advise how you use them in detail.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Was that an "agressive" entry - before the cross and candle close? What made you choose EJ over UJ today? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
hello. can anyone tell me or share what is the small lower left corner news indicator for sonic / forex fac ? thanks !

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I suppose it was aggressive, close to ADR, yellow TDI was near 68 level, large MACDpeak. EURJPY is also my favourite JPY at the moment seems smoother than the others.

On the face of it, there is not much to say. I prefer simplicity as opposed to "busy".....but most believe the more there is on a chart then it must be good. I guess that's where your "different strokes" comes into play....and if it works and generates profit then change nothing is my motto. Anyhow for this method/strategy, I use the semaphore as my main indicator, which features in practically all of my methods because as I've previously said, it acts as a pretty reliable dynamic s &amp; r for me. I am only interested though in the main semaphore for that purpose, and the smaller semaphors are unnecessary for me usually and hence are removed. That explains why the high visibility of the semaphore is important to me, and before a new week commences (usually on a quiet Sunday evening for me), I will have identified the DAILY semaphore bias for all pairs I'm interested in and made a note of their direction, and that simple part of the task takes 5 minutes against all the pairs. Now I am armed with precious information for the forthcoming week. My next task is see which of those pairs semaphors ALSO conforms to the H4 timeframe. Again, 5 minutes analysis gives me the answers. Now I know which ones I need to focus on. So, Monday morning comes along, I take a look to see if any of my pairs I'm focussing on are in a position to trade, and that is where the bars, closes and 3MAs (high and low) come into play. The lower window is not important at all at this stage to me, and in fact I could completely remove it altogether other than the fact it just about adds some bias to reinforce decision making. I have added an AUD/CHF h4 chart with ticks to show a live set of trades. Very often, as in this case, I will enter a much smaller single market order to immediately get into a set-up, and I usually add a pending set of 3 orders at the same time at a potentially better price. The reason I do this is because so often I find my pending orders leave without me on board, but then that starts entering the field of mm, and I'll leave that for now. The chart clearly shows where I entered, and you can see that they correspond to the MA3 being very close to or above the high dotted line, and the candle colour is red. Btw, my colours are purposely reversed to help identify buying or selling. The lower window incidentally, does conform to my signals, ie right colour, right place...I'm good to go I realise this system is not the same as yours apart from the semaphore, but I've always believed in simplicity personally, and your chart just looks far too busy for my liking. Diff strokes again haha I've added the volatility quality indicator used in the lower window. I also use a standard stochastic to provide a scale only, the stoch lines are not needed, and I've changed the b/g colour using the rectangle tool from the shapes menu. The way I trade is the way I trade, everyone is different and most I'd hope would understand their own indicators and settings and how they react, for instance, what I might consider an entry signal may not be so for someone else....no two traders are alike!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Well...if you could explain where this "high dotted line" comes from (the one(s) nearby your 3MA) and also, on my chart the last 3-ball for ACH was painted 20 days ago - how does that line up with your h4 ?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Carefully read post explaining ..... 3MAs (high and low) come into play. The last square (major semahor) occurred 16 days ago on my daily chart as a matter of fact, and 12 bars ago on my h4 chart. Whether yours corresponds or not is actually neither here nor there. What is important though is that you understand the settings and the generated signal....I do not have to understand your settings at all nor does anybody else... just you.

Hi Drewas, Nice thread and method you have here. I have been following with interest since I found it a couple of weeks ago. Quick question if I may, what MACD settings are you using? I can't make them out on your charts because they are hidden behind the news panel. Is it the standard 12,26,9 MACD settings? Also do you ever use the 4 hour or daily yellow dot for a direction bias? i.e. if the last yellow dot on the 4 hour chart (or daily chart) is a low would you ever only take long trades and vice versa if the yellow dot is a high would you give preference bias to short trades? What I mean is to still trade using the 1 hour charts but only in the direction indicated by the higher time frames? Thanks Nelson

--- 帖子 #373 ---
That didnt go well out on EUR/USD for break even and 6 pips lost on AUD/USD. It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so. Mark Twain

--- 帖子 #374 ---
My MACD settings are 11,12,11. I consider the longer terms eg i recently put GUPPY indicators on my charts to test but as today wouldnt have helped taking note of higher time frame as both trades were with higher trend. The one rule that helps me is that the high or low of the london session is normally set in the first three hours of London Open.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks Drewas, I'll give those MACD settings a try. For me I'm not sure I like Guppy MAs as they put so many lines on the chart. I was just trying to get a quick and easy way to get a directional bias. Thanks Nelson

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi Drewas and other followers, It seems that I've been lucky with this one ! Best regards BBF

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hai drewas am having doubt in your strategy The TDI has crossed and MACD also indicates to buy but the sun has formed... what to do in this time

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Looks like a great trade the more i do it the luckier i get .

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hey the TDI has only just crossed and you have a yellow semaphor and its around red news this is a dangerous trade for me. I always trade away from yellow semaphore suns and try not to trade until 30mins to an hour after red news.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Thanks for the information drewas.... And one more question how to use the ADR. In the picture it shows Rmup:82, RMDn:114 &amp; T=71. what is the meaning for this

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Average Daily Range (ADR) is used to give an idea of how far a pair may move each day so if you look at ADR on the picture says 133 pips so recently the pair moves around 133 pips per day. Obviously yesterdays 189 bumped up the average from 115 on 5days and 114 on 20days. Room up or down is the room youve got left before price hits yesterdays pips range so if your approaching one of those or the 5 day average you might consider looking for an exit or think twice about entering a trade. Used in isolation it doesnt mean much but if you know a pair usually moves 100 pips and its only moved 10 at the moment (provided you take into count other factors eg time of day, news, etc) it improves probability that it will move to or around 100 the ADR. Hope that helps. There are probably more concise answers if you google. ADR.

Hi Drewas, I notice on your recent posts you are using the Synergy Pro TDI rather than the TDI Red Green attached to post #1. I was reading through some of the TMS thread today and came across this post - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...26#post8438126 The post says to use the TDI Realtime (in the absence of having the Synergy Pro TDI which is presumably a paid for indy?) and change the settings to match the default setting of the Synergy Pro TDI. It also says the TDI Red Green repaints so I thought I'd give the TDI REaltime a try. Please can you post a screen shot of your Synergy Pro TDI settings so I can use the same settings in the TDI Realtime? Thanks Nelson

--- 帖子 #395 ---
So took a very long time but i held for 30 pips. I set the lower take profit as price been mving slowly today and it hit around the pink semaphore bouncing off the Guppy MA. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Nelson the only settings in the TDi are the RSI 10 value. The Synergy Pro indicators are paid for although i believe they can be found on this site through the paperclip if you look hard.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Drewas, thank you so much for sharing your system with everyone. I was wondering if you look at lower timeframes to enter? I see sometimes where a trade looks good on the 4 hour but looks good in the other direction on the 1 hour.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I occasionally look at daily but predominantly 1HR. 1HR is my focus and look to make 50 - 100 pips that day.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thanks Drewas. Here is an image from my MT4 showing the TDI Realtime indy for 6-7 Sept which pretty much matches accurately your Synergy Pro TDI for the same time period.

If you had deep pockets and faith in the system could have taken same trade on a number of JPY pairs:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thanks and good luck with that trade. when you say you exit when half the adr is hit do you mean when it is hit for the first time that day or even that amount after the adr is hit? For example right now the adr for eur/jpy is 94 and todays range is already 111 so does that mean you would tp at 47 pips still?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Out for 45.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Half the ADR is a target for the pair in any direction. Today was below half ADR because of other factors. I exited when it looked likely next bar was going to be blue. So today it was half ADR after ADR had already been hot for the day.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Ok so if the adr was 100 and we are already at 70 for todays range and theres 30 left to hit the adr bottom and you open a trade would you still take profit at +50 pips?

Slow burn today took many hours but exited for 40 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If I hadn't pips for the day I might enter and aim for my 50pips but exit at 30 if possible. Happy with whatever the market gives me.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I took the same trade but closed for -15. At that time there was a retrace of some 25 pips - why did you decide to hold on to your trade when you often get out for -5 or less?

I took 2 trades today 1 for a loss and 1 win. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The first trade i took as tdi green bounced off red, over the 50 line and trend line pointing up, it also broke the asian high. This turned out to be a fakeout and i ended up getting out at a loss of 20 pips. Im not sure at what point you realise exactly its a fakeout so would be interested to hear your thoughts about that. The 2nd trade was as it was turning the opposite way with more volume, tdi cross and asian low breakout, i took a tp of 58 pips 4 hours after that.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) First trade today price at London open mving away from yellow semafor quite rapidly after two yellow suns overnight. No TDi cross so kinda against my rules but taken in anticipation of one. Currently 30 pips have moved stop to break even + 2 so no risk now.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Nice trading. For me im aware to a fake out if the candle is 50% or less of size and is close to a new candle. Of course its subjective and depends on how fast price is moving.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hello Drewas I just subscribed to your amazing thread ...but I've got a question or two. Does this system work for every currency or selected currency? Has it been profitable in the long run, or will it require tweaking as the market dynamics changes over time? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hi it works for all currency and time frames. Personally I trade 1HR and look for pairs with a ADR of 100 or more purely because its easier for me to get my 30,50 or 100 pipsthan it is on a pair that only moves 50 pips a day. You may want to start on a lower ADR pair as until you get the hang of it your losses will be smaller too. The system is a variation of the TMS I have been trading it for around 5 years and really only add an indicator or two to see if it helps but the essence is the same as TMS just with the semafore indicator to help me recognise direction and get an idea for possible targets. Targets may reduce or increase over time but the system works once you know what to look for and has worked long before I started doing it. If you want to check go back and see after you get a yellow semafore 3 how often the MACD goes through 0 and makes a new peak. Any pair any time frame you will be amazed. Of course sometime you will get a yellow semafor and price will turn around and make a new high or low in that direction but thats where your exit and money management comes in.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hello Drewas. Looks like your still going strong! Do you use the same indicators off your 1st post or have you changed things up. I like that you have stuck around usually the originator of the thread disappears after little bit. I like what your doing keep it up!!

So out for 50 should have and meant to cancel my take profit order oops. Still cant complain. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Same indicators more or less added guppy moving averages but thats about all. I found that posting my trades helped in formalising the process. I find that thread originators start and then stop either because they give up or trade in a different way or earn so much money they stop trading maybe. I have tried other systems and still do occasionally but always come back to this as my bread and butter.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi Drewas Pls am eager to know, on the average how many trades do you take daily via this system , and what's ur approx. winrate?? David

Its all in the thread what issues are you having?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
and i have a suggestion to make. i know i don't have the right to ask, but if you guys can make a video of this strategy so that newbies like me can benefit from it.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
when i download the indicators, it opens in the meta editor instead of the terminal. but i was able to sucessfully install the template, but i doesnt have all the indicators

Hello Drewas, May I ask what settings you are using for your TDI please. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Entered EURJPY at london open but exited when candle retraced for -6 pips. Should have gone GBP/JPY or USD/JPY profits to be had today.

Got to say thanks again Drewas for this thread and method. I've been trying it out on demo for the last few weeks and am getting the hang of it slowly. Thought I'd post a trade for today. USDJPY - +44. Traded short away from orange dot and last yellow semaphore. TDI cross and price below 5 EMA. Out at TP for half ADR. The white line is the 5 EMA, typical price, shift 3. This is the same as they use on the Trading Made Simple thread and price crossing this seems to work for me as good confirmation for entries, although it sometimes get me in a bit later than just using a new yellow semaphore and candle colour change, as you specify in your rules. Each to his own I guess. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So out of both trades prematurely for EURJPY ( I reentered at an earlier retrace after manually exiting for breakeven) and just in time for GBPUSD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD only just making a new peak through 0 on the MACD but making it none the less. Guilty of not holding on long enough on EURJPY and has gone on to make three bars into new MACD through 0 peak. Would have hit my 50 pip target had I not exited. Shoulda woulda coulda!.

AUDJPY +26. Was dubious about this trade as it had already exceeded the ADR for the day before London open, but TDI was overbought and had crossed on it's way back down so thought I'd give it a go. Trailing stop took me out but it didn't work out too bad. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Drewas , I've been trying out the strategy but experiencing some issues...for example , a big SUN appears let's say indicating a Buy trade, all of a sudden u see another small dot appearing indicating trade in the opposite direction how do you deal with that? And do you set predetermined SL?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Pls those that have tested this strategy, pls can you guys share your findings.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Used on its own the semafor indicator is quite dangerous because it repaints, that is if you get a yellow sun 3 semafor and blindly enter a buy then the chances are a bar or two down the line a new yellow semafor 3 sun will appear. We use TDI crosses to confirm and factor in ADR of the pair, time of day, news, support, resistance etc. I now use the semafor like a compass because I know that price goes from yellow sun to yellow sun. Dont take my word for it though pull up any chart put the idicators on and mark sun to sun theres your opportunity:- Heres recent EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice the number of red dots between the yellow ones. They act as a warning that price is likely to change direction in the short term.

DAX30: +114. Not sure if anyone has tried using this method to trade the Dax, but thought I'd give it a go with some success. Entered after yellow semaphore, candle colour change and TDI cross. Also TDI was oversold. After first blue candle price pulled back a little and I was watching for the pullback to finish on the M5. Exit at TP (half ADR). ADR on the DAX is usually 150 to 300 pips, sometimes more. Looks like I could have made the full ADR as it's shot up again in the last hour. But half ADR is the rules...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Drewas, I have to say I appreciated your posts on this thread but I have had a go at this strategy but it is not for me. kingdavid, The yellow repainting sun was stopped me entering to many good trades, with the trend but against the yellow sun. I was afraid of entering with a 1 or 2, with the trend but against the sun and so not getting any trades in, Later on I would check the trade and find out that the yellow sun had happily repainted further up the trend line but I still could not enter with the trend because the yellow sun was waiting at the top. After watching this on a very strong trend repaint like 8 times, I knew this strategy was not for me.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
So a real waste of time today on eurjpy. Ranging a few pips all day. i exited earlier trade at around break even and then tried a buy with the same result. Nothing lost so live to fight another day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Cpt thanks for posting. The samfor indicator does repaint and thats why I advise to use it in conjunction with the TDI cross to filter. For me its a compass. i guess we all cant see the market in the same way. Thats what makes it a market i guess.

Hi Drewas, why did you choose AU over EJ and/or UJ - looks the same?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Was the pair with nearest yellow semafor. Others work just not as regularly as yellow semafors. Also ADR had already been reached at buy signal so room up but little down.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
As an addendum to my AUDUSD trade today. Notice that after the stall and TDI bounce (where I exited) that price continued up through MACD 0 to new peak. Happens with a very high frequency. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Drewas, how was your 2016 in total? Any idea how many % of your trades were H4 and how many H1? Thanks

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I believe this system should work. Thanks for sharing. Is the channel indy with the default setting from mt4.i? .I feel good signals happens when, after the sun, not latter than next two candles crosses the Channel or after next two candle which didn't cross the channel, if a candle closes higher (for buy) /lower (for sell) than last four red candles(for buy) /blue candles(for sell) and usually then, tdi have crossed also. That's my little contribution.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Almost all now on H1. Good 2016 when i trade and i dont everyday I average around 40-50 pips per day.

Closed when next candles retraced of course has continued back up. May reenter both. See what New York open bring out for total of 25 pips. Busy fixing a dishwasher so missed a more profitable exit (thats my excuse!). That should pay for a new one if my fix doesnt work .

Yep got it down by the looks of it. Notice because of the sharp change of direction and the fact there is no new semafor yet, coupled with the retrace back from the pink MA you can be confident that an early entry will be profitable. All about probabilities and putting them in your favour.

Great stuff.

Hey Moonie, Dont normally trade those pairs and wouldnt trade the 1hour at that time of day. Holding overnight on 1Hour is extremely risky. I personally would have exited at next semaforelevels.

Hi Drewas, I'm still on demo so lessons learnt in a safe environment. I was toying with the idea of taking a trade with a H1 chart and then managing it with a M15 chart, i.e use a semafore in the opposite direction to get me out of a trade. What do you think? Moonie.

Just to illustrate how useful the semafor is, once you understand it is golden. Works any time frames. Todays trade viewed in higher timeframe H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Shows yesterdays yellow semafore when viewed in todays context strong idicator that price would move away from yesterdays and todays semafor. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So if trading D1 youd maybe wait for stronger confirmation before going short. BTW check out last yellow semafor and tdi cross up, good for some 800 pips.

One of todays trades from GBP/USD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered a little late 1 hour after London open after TDI bounce and away from last yellow 3 semafor.

A trade from yesterday illustrating my use of the 10 SMA yellow. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've recently added it and use as a secondary confirmation of price continuation. Notice how while red wicks penetrate beyond the 10 SMA price closes on each bar still above. Pop it on a chart and see how often that happens, can be traded as the most simple of systems entering when candle closes above or below 10 SMA and closing when price bar closes above or below the 10 SMA the other way. Works on all time-frames. Attached Image Allowed me to bag 40 pips where as I would have ordinarily have exited after candle colour closed opposite to trade direction (red).

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Is it valid singal @ Drewas, Moonie

Apologies for slow response been on my holidays. Yes is valid entry and was good for around 70 pips. Took a long time for price to go through 0 on MACD but did eventually. Attached Image

4 or 5 good trades today using this method. One from USDJPY:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Slow but steady and still moving up. Entered after TDI cross a little early in Frankfurt open for me.

Someone just said its only 20pips is it worth half a days work? Well depends on the individual and the goals they want from trading.

Sounds like the system is working for you. I'm surprised it is because of all the indicators. My personal thought is that if a system has too many indicators, it's going to be a fail but, it sounds like that's not always the case.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Some trades taken yesterday

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Each of the indicators has a purpose, TDI, Semafor si used for entry MACD, 10MA is used to help with exits. The rest is just moving averages. Works for me.

Good morning Drewas, any changes or alterations to your nice system? Thanks

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I'm sharing my experience and not criticising the system,i also made same system something like this depending entries on semafor.it is very unrealiable specially it repaints and since it appears on revesal zone,you can stuck with opposite trade and price may never come back there until n unless u place stop loss.this system needs more confluences like all other system,although the concept is good.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
No real changes trade it everyday but dont always post. 50 pips today from EUR/USD and EUR/GBP. Trade away from yellow semafor and price often goes through MACD 0 to 3 or more bars.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
As discussed the semafor is just a guide, you need a TDI cross or other confirmation to ensure you are the right side of the semafor dot. It does repaint but so does price I like an indicator that is accurate, rather than one that was accurate at some point in the past.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thanks Drewas, its always good to see you again. I plan to start trading your system beginning next week. Which pairs would you recommend to follow aside from USDGBP, EURUSD, USDJPY and EURGBP? For a start? Thanks

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi Drewas, thanks for the system, i came across it yesterday and have read the thread from start to finish and I just wanted to say what a great system it is. I have taken a number of trades and they are all winners so far. It does seem to depend upon getting the macd cross and the TDI cross in place before entering. but its very simple to use. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Unfortunately dont have time to post much these days. Still trading this system pretty much as is. Still profitable and still works!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Nice to you see your post, I will be back in forex trading with this system, will try to post the trades here, lets keep this thread alive.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
can someone please add alarms or push notification in semafor indicator,thanks

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hello Drewas, I hope you are well. Time for an update? How was 2018 and the first half of 2019? Thanks

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I just found this system while searching thru the Trading Systems tab. I don't know how this system is not more well known at this point. I applied the indicators to a 4 hr chart on GBP/USD and was shocked. The results on GU based on the 4 hr tab were all winners for October as far as I could tell. Most were 100+ pips winners. Some of them were massive winners. There were a few trades that would only go for 30 to 50 pips. That's pretty impressive. I'm talking about if you trade from Sun to Sun. Now of course it all depends on the pair you are trading. And you could add extra confirmations like support and resistance, MACD, or trendline breaks. And being the 4 hr time frame, you may have to hold on to the trade for days to weeks if you want to trade from Sun to Sun. Pretty impressive stuff. Thanks for the system, will be trying it out.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
but isnt the semaphor repaint?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Please, someone add push notification in the semafor. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Bro, did you test it real time? i asked you this because the indie repaints

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Not really sure about the repainting. But even if you get into the trade late a few candles you'll still be a winner. I entered several orders last night using this system and so far all of them have been winners. Gbpusd was a big winner for me. Of course nothing is 100%. You still have to have the TDI confirmation or other indicator confirmation. But I'm not messing with you. I put this on the 4-Hour chart of GBP / USD. I rolled the chart back through October and all of them were winners on some level. You wait for a sun and the confirmations and take the trade. You can get out at the next Sun.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
So I just read up on what a re-painting indicator does, I was not aware of what that was actually. To be honest, if you are on the 4 hr timeframe it really does not make too much of a difference if it repaints. I just ran a backtest of the EURUSD with just the semaphor indicator. I ran it from today till about February. I had one loser. I think on the smaller timeframes it may make a larger impact. But on the 4 hr time frame we really dont have to be that precise. Just wait a few candles and make sure the Sun stays, then think about entering. Or course you can always use the TDI, MACD, Trendline breaks are always fabulous. Looking good so far. Will keep testing.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
This was the 1 loser I found on EU.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
thx do you only trade the sun?

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I will be now trading from Sun to Sun only. Try it for yourself. I tried it out today and it worked very well.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I'd like to test it too in demo for some months, the exactly way you are doing, It won't take me time from live trading because of the 4hr big TF. So could you kindly post your indicator and .tpl set? Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #568 ---
The indicators are at the start of the forum. I dont use any template. I bring up a blank chart, drop in the Semaphor indicator, Tipu MACD (free from the market), ADR, and the TDI.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I have tested semaphor indicator a couple of years back and even modified it quite a bit for my own use. Do not trust it with backtesting as backtesting calculation is different from live. Metatrader already knows the numbers in advance when backtesting, while in live it has to get the feed. You have to test it with live feed to be able to make a decision. Anyway, semaphor is using zigzag indicator with different values so do not base too much of your trades on that indicator.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
While I can generally agree with what you are saying, only 1 losing trade in EURUSD from now till last February is pretty impressive. And I did test it last week. My trading was considerably improved since using this indicator. The only problem which has already been brought up is re-painting. But this can be easily resolved by simply waiting a few bars on a 4 hr chart. I traded most of the GBP pairs a was getting many profits only over a few days. 1 micro lot on GBPJPY and GBPUSD and Friday morning both were in $20 of profit. GBPCHF was the only 1 that did'nt really work out. I was around -$4.80 in loss. The rest hovered around 0, small profits, or big profits. Will keep testing, but so far I have never seen results like this. As I see it now, you could lose for only a few reasons. One, you get into the trade and then you get the opposite signal. Two you get into the trade late and it goes against you.

hello brother, glad to hear you have success here. well done !!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
We shall see. Still in early stages.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Greetings, nice to see some people still using the system. Will try and posts a few tades in the coming days.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) For those asking. Still trading the same way. Above is a trade taken today. Only difference is that my broker is now using MT5 so have had to update indicators and semafor indicator. Can post if needed.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Thanks for the update Drewas, any info on average results per week and if you still prefer same pairs. Furthermore I wonder if opening H1 trades and instead of exiting switch to H4 for exit would make any sense. MT5 indis would be much appreciated. Thanks for coming back regularly to this thread of yours. All the best

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi Drewas, I hope you (and your family) are well and safe in these times. Any chance you give us an update on the system, results, and your recommendations? Posting your MT5 indicators would be very helpful. Thanks and stay safe

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hey don't get much time to post these days but still using the system and still works (for me). Only change is I am now using MT5 and new indicators attached.

Thanks a lot Drewas - very kind of you!

No problem if it helps someone then goal achieved. Things I think about entry ( there are better threads in ff about money management position sizing etc.) Time of day. The high or low of the day is almost always set in the first three hours of the London session. If you enter short or long from the last large semafore (pink or blue dots) it will continue in that direction to at least three MACD bars. Consider taking or locking in profit then. Sometimes it doesn't turns and creates a new high which is where your stop loss comes in. Then look for the next entry. Don't take my word for it though do your own testing.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Didn't trade this today (wish I had) potential of around 60 -70 pips had you entered around the TDi cross. Can see the system nicely on this pair the last couple of days. Same things happen every day just need to recognise them and take action.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Good day all and especially Drewas. Again a year has passed. I really like your MT5 setup. Much cleaner and nicer than your (still helpful) MT4 setup from post 1. Is there a semaphore alert available? Don`t know or use MT5 yet. Thanks

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Still using the system. Still making pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A trade taken today.

Hi Drewas I see you use some Renko. Wonder if you can give templates for mt5?

A trade from earlier today. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Could have re entered after smaller blue semafor and could have made circa 40 pips, but I only trade the larger ones.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Still works. Don't have time to post so much these days but still trading this way. A particularly good day today on a number of pairs. Circa 350 pips on these four. Rules the same trade away from last '3' semaphore, wait for TDi cross or look for it for confirmation and hold until MACD goes through 0 (which it will always do if the 3 holds). Use preferred stop loss, and exit strategies take pips, and look for the next one. Simple

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Simple and great! And well done! Good to hear from you, although another year has passed. All the best!

--- 帖子 #593 ---
A couple of nice trades today. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered this one late but still managed to get pips though.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Cant win them all! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Got stopped out after 20+ pips in my favour and moving my stop loss to break even. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course has since gone down again and has broke through the MACD 0 as expected. That's trading I guess.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi Dewas. Could you tell me, where you put your initial SL? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Thank you for the posts Dewas! Good thread

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hey ET. I normally enter with a SL of 50pips or at the last semaphore. If a trade goes 20-25 pips in my favor will try to move SL to break even plus a pip or two.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Nice 100 pips trade today. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Couple of hours before london open but i couldnt resist

--- 帖子 #600 ---
HI , take the same trade on GBPUSD ,i enter long at 1.18221 ,SL was hit at 1.1804 just to change direction after. Like this happen every time for me

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I took a similar trade on EUR/USD. Entered before LO but slow day on that pair. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Took several hours of not really going anywhere. Managed to exit with a 23pip profit. My stop on this one was at the 3 semaphore and i left it there which saved me from being stopped out. Had it continued down past the 3 semaphore would have been a small loss. May still eventually go through the MACD 0 but am happy with 23 pips on that trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Thanks so much for publishing this and showing that it's still profitable years down the line. Really studying this strategy but struggling with when you're actually entering, Drewas. Apologies if mistaken but I believe your rules are to wait for a sun / '3', then when the candle colour changes enter the trade. After that, you have to decide to stay in or drop out depending on whether there's a TDI cross. But, in some examples you've given you don't seem to have entered at the specified point, but entered a lot later. For example, the trade in post 313: why did you not enter on the 1st blue candle after the '3' + colour change + TDI cross? Instead you waited another 5 candles before entering?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hey Jinch, Glad your getting some value out of the posts. I don't trade all day and sometimes am slow to see the trade opportunity. I will still enter if there seems to be an opportunity to make PIPS Away from last semaphore, tdi cross and space for price to go through 0 on MACD. Sometimes if semaphore 3 appears And I get a new bar colour will enter and wait for tdi Cross to confirm I've made a good choice.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) An example from today's setups. I haven't traded this but you could. I normally try to enter on the first or second candle colour change, you see there is already a red 'lesser' semaphore so need to be cautious but both trades are valid for me as there's probably pips to be made as price goes through MACD 0. Of course, it may reverse on you and go up to make a new '3' semaphore but that's when you get out and look for the next trade. If the 3 semaphore sticks then there's a high probability price goes through MACD 0 and so PIPS can be had. Time of day, news, etc can all affect this but that's where your money/trade management comes in.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) So as a follow-up to the chart this morning you can see that had you (and I) entered a sell after the 3 yellow semaphore and confirmed with a TDi cross you would have made pips. Price flew past the moving averages and went through the MACD 0 and formed a new 3 semaphore. Had I traded this I would be looking for an exit even though there is no blue reversal candle or TDI cross in the other direction. Circa 200 pips possible. Was an unusual day in that there was lots of big news which helped the movement but illustrates the system quite well. Actually, as I'm typing the above I can see the first blue candle and a possible TDI cross which confirms i should be exiting according to MY trading plan. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) So a follow-up from yesterday. Yesterday's last 3 semaphore and tdi cross might act as an exit from the large moves yesterday. It can also be an entry as per this system. If you entered away from the last 3 semaphore at the break of the last red candle you would be PIPS positive by around 50pips right now. Will the price continue through the MACD 0 or continue down and form a new low (3 semaphore)? I don't know, I do know that if the last 3 semaphore holds then there is a high probability it will go through MACD 0 if it doesn't then maybe look for an exit. I don't normally trade at this time but this is an example of how the system works. As you can see theres big news today so be very careful if you trade this system today.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Following on from this morning's post. The 3 semaphore from yesterday held and the price went through MACD 0 albeit very slightly. Depending on your entry you could have made between 50 - 80 pips trading this morning. I would be looking for an exit from the trade around the first TDI red-green cross and look for another setup.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) These are the pairs that have 3 yellow semaphores so far this morning. USD/CAD is a valid entry with a TDI cross so let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hello ! Are my entries valid? I enter when the candle which changed color closes

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hello

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Many thanks, Drewas. That helps clear up some things in my mind. Again, massive thanks for this thread. I'm working through every page and post, taking notes and screenshots. Afraid I'll probably have a few more questions for you when I get to the end!

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hey Oleh. They look like good entries to me. One that wouldn't have worked out (in hindsight) GBPUSD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So price went up to form a new 3 semaphore after the one earlier in the day. Had you traded the TDI cross and got in candle one or two of the change then you would have made a few pips, broken even, or maybe taken a small loss depending on your exit/money management strategies. You cant win them all and I would be looking to trade off the new semaphore early next week if I see setups on this pair.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
The blue candle with the long red tail would be a warning to think about exiting a trade or not entering one yet. My stop-loss on that one would probably have kept me in the trade if you were already in it. I start normally with a 50pip stop loss I try to preserve my account capital so might have exited and waited for the break of the next semaphore 3. Easy after the fact, more difficult when trading it live. Practice, practice, practice and it will come. One thing that might have helped is I have learned that the high or low of the London Trading session is formed in the first couple of hours of the London session. Don't take my word for it though do your own testing!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Glad it's useful to you. I am not an expert and this is only what I found to work for me only. It has worked for me over years. Do your own testing and practice if you want to use it. I don't trade every day as it fits in around a full-time job but will answer questions if I can and time allows.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hey Drewas Are you now using APS's instead of HA's bars? Also I noticed you are using the Synergy Pro TDI. Have you found that to be more accurate than the original TDI? Thanks

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hey Shrips. Yes is APB on recent charts and yes TDI Synergy Pro indy is on some of my charts. It makes no difference to me I have APB on my desktop and Heiken Ashi on my mobile app:- Compare the two. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Normal TDI works great also I have it on my mobile app.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hello . I closed this deal with no loss

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Thank you very much for the recommendations! I will try to trade in different ways to find what works best for me

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hello Drewas ! I have a question for you How to calculate the size of the stop loss for highly volatile instruments such as dax and gold, because 50 pips will not be enough? Maybe 50% of ADR?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Took this sell trade on EURUSD on the 28th. Cyan line indicates where I placed the trade. Red horizontal line is the strike price. Reasons to enter: - the yellow sun had appeared a couple of candles before (it's now repainted so much it's gone off the screen) - candles turned red - TDR green dropped through TDR red - plenty of room for price to drop before it reached any SMAs - inside LO to NY close trading period However, price continued to rise and is still doing so 2 days later. Was this just a trade that went against me, or did I miss a rule / do something I shouldn't have?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I dont trade dax or gold but maybe at last 3 yellow semaphores.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hey Jinch, Sometimes trades just don't work out. That trade seems valid as per the rules, on that occasion price didn't continue through MACD 0 before continuing up and creating a new high and so new yellow 3 semaphore. This is where your stop loss and trade management comes in. There's a high probability it would go through MACD 0 as per the subsequent 3 times a new yellow 3 semaphore formed but no guarantees. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I actually traded that last 3 semaphore yesterday. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Was one of the trades I took. 50 - 60 Pips available had i been able to monitor the position but closed happy with 23 pips. Similar trades also on EURJPY and GBPUSD also yesterday.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hi Drewas, I just saw this thread today. I have used TMS before with no much success. Will read the old posts and give this a try. Thank you for keeping the thread alive over the years. BTW why did you move to MT5 from MT4? any special reason?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hey Drewas, thanks for this system. seems simple and clear. i have applied the available indicators but my charts don't print yellow last (3) can see pink and bluish only. is there any other indicator am missing? thank you

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hey Drewas! thanks for this man!! i was wondering cause i had to switch to mt5 are there mt5 indicators for this system or tradingview? thank you so much hope you are well buddy!

Attached Image (click to enlarge) A trade from yesterday. All the usual rules. Traded away from yellow semaphore.Entered around the TDI cross MACD went through 0. The yellow lines are fibonacci levels which I have been playing with recently notice how the price stalls at these levels. I could have / should have held on as price went down to the 100 Fib level. I exited at 45 pips after new smaphore 3 formed and price stalled around 61 fib. Attachment g

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks Drewas for your continuous support. But usual rules? I thought (post1) to enter at close of candle once semaphore has occurred and to get out of the trade quickly, if not confirmed by a (later) TDI crossing. Have I got this wrong? Thanks

--- 帖子 #569 ---
After more than 10 years everybody left the building? What a pity!

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Still trading this way. Works for me. Above is one of my trades from Friday.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Drewas , your loyalty to a trading strategy over the years is amazing as it is commendable

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Like many i swapped and changed systems at the start of my trading until I found the trading made simple thread. Adjusted it for what made sense to me and traded it until I was profitable. A lot of good systems work if applied correctly, now im hesitant to change or add too much to the system as it just works for me. No real need to post continually because it hasnt really changed. I work so is a side hustle for me.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
So having more time on my hands than expected have been playing with developing a scalping system based around RSS. Main difference is have ditched the TDi and am now just using MACD and RSi which is used only to give an oversold or overbought level on the macd. So rules are the same pretty much take trades away from 3 Semaphore after cross of MACD lines when above or below 80 overbought or 20 oversold level. Have tested and took my first live trade with it today on GBP/JPY this morning for 30pips. Notice this is on the 1 minute chart so adjust stop losses and take profit expectations as necessary. This is scalping so 5pips per trade is a win and anything additional is a bonus for me. This trade was taken against the higher time frame trend but testing has shown that provided you take the trade following the roles pips can be mad. As always do your own testing.

Thanks for the update Drewas (and the attachments)! Although I`m a little surprised. Is it only because you wanted to trade shorter TF - or did the original setup lose its effectiveness? Thanks

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Any further update, Drewas? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hey Drewas, would you mind sharing your MACD/RSI Settings? I can't get it look like yours on my charts....
