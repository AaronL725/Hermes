I think I have found a very good strategy and was wandering if I could have some thoughts on this…. You know someone to play Devils Advocate J . I was sat down last night thinking about the daily range of the market and started to wander if there was some sort of relationship between where the market starts 00:00am gmt and where it finishes. For example if the market goes 50 points one way then how often does it retrace and how often does it carry on going for its 100-150 pip daily range. So I pulled up some daily data on the cable market and started back testing. I have now back tested to May 2006 and will carry on going but here are my rules. If the market goes 50 points in any one direction from the price it was at at midnight gmt. Then enter the trade with a 30 point limit order and a 30 point stop loss. This so far on Cable has given me 1500 points since the beginning of May. This looks good to me but am I missing something that is fundamentally or technically wrong with such an approach?

I had been seeing this type of activity and had concluded that if the market was generally moving in a particular direction after the London open,then it was likely to carry that day. Nothing scientific, but there is something in this. Interested in your findings.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Did you consider spread? If you would have 5-pip spread it would cost you 1200 pips or so.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Igor has something similar, dynamic breakout method aka dbo, check for it on forex-tsd site, very similar to what you are taking about I think.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I took spread into consideration..... I have a 3 pip spread. How did you get a cost of 1200 pips anyway? Well I demoed it today for the first time and came up trumps $300 profit. Beginners luck? I hope not but lets wait and see:-) I'll keep posting my results here daily

--- 帖子 #6 ---
you mean to say that if the price goes +50 pips then place the limit order at 30 pips away that makes +80 pips away from the yesterday's close...am I right ????? Thanks

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Basically, you enter a trade once the price has moved 50 points in a direction away from the price that it was at, at midnight UK. You take profit once you have made 30 points. You also set a stop loss at 30 points from your entry price. example. Midnight= 1.8800 Entry at= 1.8850 Profit at= 1.8880 Stop Loss at= 1.8820 Does this help? I am still only testing it, but if you want to test as well and post your results here then it would be much appreciated.

Micardo, This kind of sounds a little like the Big Ben Strategy. If you google it you will see what it is. If I remember the first 15minutes of the London session set this trade also. Yours is of course a little different.. Nice thinking out of the box. Have you been forward testing since May or was this a back test from May? thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hey SMJONES, No I haven't forward tested this at all. Today was the first day and it made profit. It is all backtesting. It only came to me last night as if by magic :-) So you have heard of such a thing before.... Do you think it can work?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Since your stop equals your profit target, you can do the following to have your trade lock in some profit, become a free trade, and potentially give you more profit. Simply take off half your position when your profit target is reached and move your stop to breakeven. Let your second half ride til it hits your trailing stop. Dial

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I could not say, I have not looked at it. I think this is an answer you will be able to give us. This sounds like an excellent way to find out something about market behavior. I look forward to your research if you feel like sharing it along the way. The big Ben strategy seemed to work pretty well and then the markets changed... This may happen with your strategy as well... But if you see the changes coming, adapt.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks Diallist for your feedback, I will definitely look into that. The only thing is that I was looking at this as an auto trading type of strategy for the times when you can't be in front of your screen I normally trade a breakout strategy of support and resistance. Do you do this? How is it working for you? (Breakout I mean)

--- 帖子 #13 ---
SMJones, I will definitely keep you guys posted on this. I am in the middle of doing back testing to 2002, and will continue forward testing. I guess with all that info we will all be in a better position to constructively comment. :-) Keep you posted

--- 帖子 #14 ---
please keep us posted about your ForwardTestingResults so we can see if it's already worth starting an EA for this method or sth.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Sorry, it's not 1200 pips it's 600 (5 pips times ca. 120 trading days in 5 months). But if you included spread it doesn't matter. 300 pips a month sounds nice. Good luck on that

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Big Ben Strat for those interested:

--- 帖子 #17 ---
In the Vegas WB systems, Vegas has detailed information and his backtested data for the ranges for the major pairs. He specifies the probability of the pair to continue or reverse based on its current level for the day. Keep in mind the pair will only offer a probability of continuing for the day, as I think a lot of people expect it to happen 100% every day- which is obsurd. I don't have time to find the exact posting but I suggest reading through all of it to better inform yourself. I found it very helpful and the daily range idea has improved my analysis greatly. Oh yeah- and I've made some positive pips too. good luck

--- 帖子 #18 ---
So if it never goes + or - 50 from the opening price...do you just not open a trade? Also, if there is news affecting the pair near 00:00GMT do you not open a trade then, or do you just widen your stop loss

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Yes its as simple as that. At Midnight GMT. You look at the price action see where the price is. Then put a buy and sell order in 50 points away, with a take profit order of 30 pips and a stop loss of 30 pips..... So effectively your straddling. Then you simply wait for the market to do what its got to do. Don't get me wrong you do get loosing days but during my testing, so far the biggest draw down is 120 pips. Obvioulsy you need to at least double or even triple that to be on the safe side. Bottom line is this is like any other system you will get losses but in the long run you come up in profit. As I said I will keep testing this and tweaking it.... You guys should do the same then we can all come to a consensus in a few months time as to if this works or not and whether or not the levels need to be adjusted.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Has anyone coded this as a MetaTrader EA. If so please post, if not I will work on one. Also I have a document for the majors that shows probability of addition move like mentioned here. I will see if I can find it and post. Thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
What pairs are best for this type of system

--- 帖子 #22 ---
pdhawan - No I haven't coded it, and to be honest I wouldn't know how. Is that a way of backtesting it? If so then please could you do it and let us know the results. I have only analysed the GBP/USD. Feel free to look at other pairs. I really feel like this could be a good/effective strategy and with all of us looking into it am cofident that we will find a way of implementing it effectively.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Ok I've been doing some more back testing. I am testing with different profit targets. So far with a profit target of 20 pips and a stop loss of 30. Back to the beginning of november 2005 I have found that we would of made 2110 pips profit. 2110 in Just under 12 months is about 175 pips per month. I will do the same for the 25 pip profit target and 30 pip profit target.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
OK Here are the in depth results. Since November 1st 2005 there have been 263 trades. 20 Pips Profit target 2110 pips profit - 200 succesful trades vs 63 Losses = 76% Strike Rate 175 pips per month 25 Pips Profit target 2120 pips profit - 182 successful trades vs 81 losses = 69% Strike Rate 176 pips per month 30 Pips Profit target 2850 pips profit - 179 successful trades vs 84 losses = 68% Strike Rate 238 pips per month So looking at the above it is clear that 30 pips profit target is the most profitable. However a few things I need to research more is the price movement from when you enter the trade to when you take your profit. For exampleonce you enter does your profit target immediately get hit or do you get some retracement... If so how much retracement, Is a 30 pip stop loss enough? Once we answer that question we will nearly be ready to rock If anyone has anyway of analysing this please let me know.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
You may want to look at GBPUSD based on the following. FYI I found my sheet on pip trigger and percentages. See grid below it is based on +20 pips prior to entry. (these include the original +20, so for 20 pip profit look at +40, without spread on Cable) Stop placed at 20pips. 30 minute +30 +40 +50 +60 +70 +80 +90 +100 percentages 79.9 63.2 46.6 36.0 27.3 21.4 16.3 11.9 1 hr +30 +40 +50 +60 +70 +80 +90 +100 percentages 89.9 81.7 73.8 66.2 58.9 53.3 46.4 41.1 How does this compare to your backtesting numbers? I will take a look at coding over the weekend. It will be based on close price at 0 gmt (user adjustable) I will also make stop, target, and initial move variables so we can play with it in backtesting. Please let me know any other requirements before I begin. Thanks

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Micardo your numbers look pretty accurate. I found my sheet with 50 pip trigger and it had following percentages +70 is your 20 pip profit target. (below do not reflect spread on Cable) 1 hr +60 +70 +80 +90 +100 percentages 89.0 78.14 69.8 59.6 51.7 Yours are almost right on!!! My thoughts initially (because I also thought about this 2 days ago)....are we in sync? was to use a 20 pip trigger with 20 pip target...probability is 81.7%. Then to stop loss the trade at Break Even and let it go till stop is hit. That way we can capture longer runs. Once coded we will easily be albe to check the numbers. I will advise.

Hey guys, You might find some of the info in this post interesting. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...8&amp;postcount=17 The indicator {for VT Trader} is in the post that follows.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks Bemac.... I will read and digest this weekend :-). Pdhawan - My thinking is this. You take the price at Midnight GMT. You then enter the market once the price has moved exactly 50 PIPS in either direction. Your profit target is initially 30 PIPs then like you say maybe we can leave a portion on the table to ride the bigger move. The thing we need to know is once we enter the trade how large are the retracements? So where do we need to place the stop loss so that we can effectively play each trade. Theres no point in having a stop at 30 if the market regularly retraces 33 before it carries on the move. The figures look good on a daily basis. If we can work out the stop then we have just made ourselves a very effective and profitable strategy. I look forward to your response

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi, For reference, could you clarify how you are testing this? It appears it is manual. What/whose data/charts are you using? Do you check the price reaches +33 (30+3pip spread) and you take +30 profit? Do you check the price reaches -27 (30-3spread) and you take -30 stop? What timeframe are you using to check if the 30pip has been hit? Best regards Alan

--- 帖子 #30 ---
If , once the Market has moved 50 pip it then retraces 33 pips Then the 50 is wrong Or Slide the Time Scale Slightgly There will be no 100% answer to this but this Timed Breakout Strategy {00:00 GMT, 5:00 EDT Bar Close} is playing the New York Business Day Open. Give me the Close of a Bar Before the start of the N.Y. Business Day. Watch the Currency Market to monitor how the Stocks/News are doing. Once the Pair has Indicated it is going to have a +/- day, Get me in the Currency Market. Things I should know; What's the Average Daily Range of the Pair I want to trade. 100pips? 125pips? Or maybe just 50 pips? What is the Range {DayH-DayL} Today So Far, now that I want to get in? What is the difference between those two Ranges. {How many more Pips can I reasonably expect the Pair to move?} Is this Trade worth the Risk? I think you will find that you can reduce the 50Pip Entry Trigger substantially. You may also find that Different Pairs require the Clock to start ticking at a Different Time. Is there a relationship between the Times Your Trades are Signaled? Good luck &amp; hth.

Hi all. There were a couple of mentions above about the BigBend Strategy and Ktrade's posting of the BB article. I experimented for a month of live forward testing if it is of interest to you at all. At my GBP Midnite Express page you will find all my trades and charts with notes and the article that Ktrade posted also. After the testing i was wipped out physicaly as i was staying up until about 2am or so Pacific Time (hence the name "Midnite Express"). I had set a period of one month to test the model and see if i could incorporate it into my life style, trading the London Open from a Pacific Time setting. For myself it did not work. I was a zombie and missed my quiet time with my wife. So i'm back to trading the NY open and looking at somehow incorporating the dailies into my style also. What i did find is that setting TP exits at 20 pips away from entry orders 20 pips away from the price at 12:30 PT (08:30 London) would show fairly consistent wins. : ) Thom

I was looking at a strategy similar to this for the last few months. The basis of the strategy was to take the close of the hour session prior to the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;London&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; open. I would then add 20 Pips both ways. When the price reaches either target put in two orders. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Order one take at 14 pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Order two take at 80 Pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Also played around with a third order as a lot of the first move would reach around 40 pips only to retrace and come out with only 14 pips profit. Another order would take profit at 30 pips. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Put stop on both orders at the &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;London&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; open price. Once second order reaches 30 pips move to breakeven. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; There can be choppy days and even choppy months but in the back testing I did had only one unprofitable month (August - 142 PIPS) Over 5 months this strategy gained 2302 PIPS averaged 280 approx a month. Only reason for abandoning this strategy was the need to watch the charts continually throughout the day.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hi Accrete, I too am on Pacific time. I have been looking into the Big Ben strategy as well. I also looked at your demo trades. I noticed you had trades that were in both directions. I believe after the first entry there is not suppose to be another til the next day. Too many bars have passed from the HI and LO setups. Also the strategy calls for a 40 pip stop on cable. Ref: Currency Trader Sept 2004 page 33. Section "The Rules" item #4. Are you using "Midnight Express" now as "Rush Hour"? If so how are your results?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Guys, OK results for today... We hit our profit target of 30 pips by 10am gmt. Not bad although I have spoken to another trader friend of mine who is very good and he mentioned we would need a wider stop. Maybe 50 pips. Has anyone got any feedback with regards to that?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
.. worked fine for the first day...made more than 50 pips overnight,may be i was just lucky,we'll see!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Yes on days like these it is a great strategy.... But not all days make such a consistent breakout, which is our current problem. Some days it hits our entry trigger. Retraces a little then carries on going. We need to find a way of not getting stopped out but also not loosing to much of our profits on the days when it doesn't go our way. But so far 2 out of 2 days for me. mmmmm.... Maybe this isn't an autotrading strategy.... Maybe we manaully enter at the 50 pips mark take partial profit on 30 pips and leave the rest to run...... I believe someone mentioned this earlier. Guys what are your thoughts about doing it like that..... So same entry and everything but only takeing say one out of 2 or 3 lots off the table at 30 pips profit

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The only problem I find with taking profit at 30 pips only is if it reverese prior to taking some profit and your stop loss gets hit your out 60 - 90 pips depending on the stop loss gap. What I found most of the time was that if you entered order 20 pips away from London open you would nearly always take 14 pips of the table on first order. If the trade reversed against you then you would be down 26 Pips for second and third being stopped out. If the trade continued your way then you would make a sizable profit for the day. The win reward ratio was good most of the time risking 26 pips for a maximum 114 pips win. If third order was not hit you still walked away with 44 pips. first order - 14 pips second order - 30 pips third order - 80 pips

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Has anyone checked this out on the GBP/JPY? I could see potential on this pair also. This is merely an assumption at this point though. I will begin checking it, but if anyone has any insight... please share.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
So, I am seeing a lot of +20 before reversing. What if you did more lots for a +15 (20 with spread in my case)? Maybe 5 lots, that would be just as good. Forgetting what I just wrote, I have questions/comments. 1) Do you ignore (or get rid of orders to get in) if neither have hit at a certain point, say 12 hours after 00:00GMT? (or what if you are in and after 12 hours target ins't hit, do you get out??) 2) It seems in all of the orders that end of failing eventually hit the target, but sometimes a day after. 3) You use the OPEN price at 00:00GMT to determine the +50/-50 right?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Llambert - The way I have been looking at it is you reset the orders every 24 hours. So yes you take the opening price at 00:00am GMT. Brick911 - I haven't looked into any other pairs unfortunately otherwise I would offer some insight. Markj - I have also considered taking profits at different levels but just needed to get a good insight as to the right levels. Your way seems very good, have you forward or backtested it... If so what are your reults... % Wins, and Pips Profit per month/week etc. I am convinced this sort of strategy has potential simply for the fact that the market does on average range about 100 pips plus. So all we need to do is find a consistent place to enter and good exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Ok, understood, but what about this part? 1) Do you ignore (or get rid of orders to get in) if neither have hit at a certain point, say 12 hours after 00:00GMT? (or what if you are in and after 12 hours target ins't hit, do you get out??)

--- 帖子 #42 ---
llambert, generally speaking and don't take this as gospel cos im trialling it too. But at the moment I am simply leaving orders open until 24 hours later or profit has been taken. Now with regards to profit taking.... this may vary as you can see many people are suggesting taking partial profits etc. So that still has to be confirmed.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I just lost 30pips, anything wrong? Short at 1.8675 10/24/06 3:34am (EST), got kick out at 1.8705 4:10am(EST) richard

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I tested similar strategy and i can write a simulation (in excel as I dont know and dont trust MT), but my question regarding it is: have you tested it at daily charts? I mean D1? Cable has a lot of whipsaws and strong reversals so proper testing should be at least at H1. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #45 ---
yeah, maybe you got it reversed??? You are supposed to make 30 pips with a 40 pip s/l I think. EDIT::: Well, I could've sworn I read that yesterday, but he does say 30s/l.. hmmmm Anyway, working on a revision to the method that seems to work fairly well. I'll let you all know after today's trade.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I must've been thinking that s/l here was 1.8920, which is 40 pips away for a s/l.. My fault.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Guys, I mentioned that this isn't a perfect art yet :-). As I said in an earlier post that a friend of mine mentioned that stops of 30 are to close so 50 was better. Eventually we will get there. At the moment im still in the trade at -350.... we'll see what happens.....

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Just a theoretical question - with such a simple system, do you really think that the market will allow you to get away with it? I have yet to see a simple mathematical system as such that can win in the long run. What makes this system any less arbitrary than any other similar system? IS this a system that will grow capital or perhaps just keep you in for a while until you can come up with something better? IS there a distinct historical advantage to waiting for 50 pips, or even at that specific time, or is this 50 pip some kind of relation to Average True Range. How about the 30 pip target, is it just as arbitrary? Point being, these systems all have one thing in common - they are all looking for any reason to get in, or rather it would seem that they are rationalizing a reason to get in based on a false premise. There is no edge getting in after 50 pips, I believe you should just wait 5 pips, why not? The only difference is that this 50 pip barrier creates the illusion of reason. I'm not trying to knock your strategy, there are really good strategies for playing black jack out there, but these strategies will all end up in the long run with a net loss. - unless of course you have a well thought out card counting strategy that can put the edge on your side - Do you feel that this strategy gives you any kind of edge in the market? I could be wrong but progress will only occur once these and many more questions are answered.

Miguel I see what you are saying... and you may well be right but.... The figures are not random figures that I have just invented from nowhere. Basically I took the daily ranges for the past 2 years and started to analyse the numbers... What I found was the majority of the time once the range past 50 points for the day then the trend continued in that same direction. Based on past results there is no doubt that your strike is higher than 65% the only one thing here is that we need to know where to place the stops and have an effective take profit strategy. As far as the entry is concerned it is just as valid as any other. But like you said this will only improve with questions such as yours... which is why I started this thread

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The only reason is statistically proven advantage over a large sample of trades. all numbers - point of entry, TP, SL are now choosen arbitrarily but in coures of backtesting could be refined. IMHO tthis strategy is worth pursuit only if there is maybe a 15-18-20 pips a day on average in plus - now, at the current point of backtest. Hope this helps. this strategy is backtested on H1, H4? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
H1 and H4 range probably wouldnt even make this stratergy worth backtesting

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Micardo, I understand that this entry is based on a 2 year historical perspective, but being so, does this entry figure get adjusted to keep this perspective updated? Having used this same logic, would it have worked for the two years prior? The reason I am being so harsh about this is that what you are doing is actually making it harder for you to come up with a logical stop loss area within the context of your trade. Where is your trade no longer valid? Well, if it is an arbitrary trade, than the stop loss will probably be just as arbitrary. The market doesn't care that you do not want to risk more than 40%-60% of your potential reward and therefore your stop loss will only make sense to you and not really be a function of where the trade logic is no longer valid. I could tell you to use fibonnacci clusters to pinpoint stop loss areas as a move through these will usually indicate more to come, but what if this is too big of a risk to fit your parameters. Point being, figure out the reason for your trade other than just attempting statistical manipulation, even if you do keep the 50 pip barrier to entry. Howabout, instead of making it 50 pips, you wait for the 1st pullback after the 50 pip barrier. buy stop the high if MACD is positive or whatever momentum filter you like and set stop loss at swing low minus a few pips and set your profit target at twice that amount as long as that amount doesn't bring you over 75%-80% of the expected daily range - when I say expected daily range I say so because there are going to be days when news items are coming due and you really cant trust these breakout signals prior to it. The market is then more likely show a much lower daily range, in which case you should avoid these times altogether. And instead of making it 50 pips, howabout making it 40-50% of the 14 day Average true range? For GBP it will be in that 50-70pip range anyway, and now this is no longer an arbitrary number - it is a belief that after penetrating a certain amount of the average daily range, the market is more likely to complete that range in accord with the current direction. Not trying to change everything all of a sudden, just some ideas that might have a little bit of an adaptive value to them to keep your logic current.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Ok still in this trade at -$240.... wow this is really playing with my emotions... What to do what to do......It feels like thi will never end. mmmm Lets see I'll keep you guys updated

--- 帖子 #54 ---
This 65% - what does it refer to - the direction continuing? or does it refer to that price will move up 30 pips in your direction before moving thirty pips in the opposite direction. Does this 30 pips include the spread in these statistics? This could make a big difference. 4 pips less on the win versus 4 pips more on the loss now makes your risk/reward 17/13 as aopposed to 1/1. At 65% profitable trades, your expected gain per lot after 100 trades is 250 pips. at 56% profitable, that becomes a 20 pip loss. That my friend is a difference of 9 trades per hundred, and its not accounting for any kind of slippage. at 50% profitable, you are getting killed, which with arbitrary systems, I believe that is really what you are looking at once enough data is used in backtesting. Now think of that total system risk in terms of total system rewards, You are risking at 50% profitable, losing 200 pips per 100 trades not including slippage or any other outside circumstances that can affect you. If you are 100% correct, you can expect 250 pips in 100 trades. If you are somewhere in between you will most likely break even or lose money in 100 trades, if taken daily, basically 100 trading days or 5 months. If used with leverage, you could really get wiped out. - This all not including the possible enormous drawdowns that occur with basic coin flip strategies. I'm not saying it doesn't work, but you better be 95% certain of your edge and be constantly evaluating it, and not stray one inch from the strategy in order to make it profitable.

This strategy has definetly been profitable over the last five months that I tested it. What I found was to set your entry from the London open price as between 12am and 6am just seems not to be the true direction of the market in most cases. Setting an entry 20 pips from market open seemed to work best. This strategy means that you could also be into a trade up to 6 times a day if market was choppy. Some choopy days proved not to be profiatable while others where. On choppy days the 3rd order would not get hit but the profit 1 at 14 and profit 2 30 pips where reguly hit and sometimes 3 - 4 times through the day. With this system you try to maintain your account through the choppy days and live for the day when the move goes one way and you collect all 3 profits. The first profit of 14 pips is a good level as it seems to help minimize you loses when market moves against your trade. First profit is almost always hit once price moves 20 pips above London open. Spread cost is stubstantial in this strategy and was deducted from these totals. &lt;TABLE style="WIDTH: 214pt; BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=285 border=0 x:str&gt;&lt;COLGROUP&gt;&lt;COL style="WIDTH: 143pt;

Thanks Markj for that detailed feedback... It looks good to me.... The real test for all us looking at this is the forward testing...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hmmm, are you saying that if you wait 20 from the 00:00GMT open (in either direction) and try to get 14 NET (after the spread or in my case 19 pips since I have 5 pip spread), then it is very accurate? Did you do a percentage to determine what it actually was?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi pdhawan. You are correct in your observation on multiple entries, this was a test and often i would place limit orders on both sides at ~20pips out from the 12:30 Pacific Time candle with TP at 20pips into whichever trade triggered. Since it was demo, i would often just let both trades go until i awoke the next morning at NY open (5am Pacific) and see what the price had done. As stated, this sort of trading burnt me out physicaly and i was not spending the time i wanted to with my wife so i have abandoned the London/Europe session. Each evening about 9pm PT i check the charts and do some homework which includes placing TDTLs on the hourly charts by way of an Audio Rising or Falling alert . Any crossing of this TL sends an audible signal from my computer out to the FM radio at my headboard with a pillow speaker : ) If a break of trendline signal is sent i will get up and take a trade if it makes sense to do so. Otherwise i am trading the NY open from about 5am to about 8am Pacific. And managing several EA forward tests in demo. . . and attempting to incorporate the Daily chart into my style. So many charts, so little time. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Llambert 3 These were my entry rule: Draw line 1 - 6am close Draw line 2 - 6am close + 20 Pips Draw line 3 - 6am close - 20 Pips Buy 3 lots when line 2 is hit Stop loss 6am close take 1 lot 14 pips take 2nd lot 30 pips set 3rd lot to breakeven take 3rd lot 80 pips Reverse for the sell Sell line 3 stop loss 6am close take 1 lot 14 pips take 2nd lot 30 pips set 3rd lot to breakeven take 3rd lot 80 pips close all orders NY close If you want to see the good months and bads months and try to design a filter then run these rules manually through May for a good month and August for a bad month. Regarding % of 14 pips 1st target hit? my original target was for ten pips but changed to 4 pips to cover spread. I would say 80 - 90 % first profit is hit. If trade reverses against you after 1st profit taken then trade loss is 30 pips + spread but reward is 125 pips if full profit is taken. You also need to hit 30 pips for a sure win of 44 pips. Cheers

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks very much for that tip Thom. I am lucky from the time frame point of view as I live in the UK - will study and demo this for a couple of months! Have you observed anything similar with the NY open? I am new to all this stuff so excuse this question. Regards Angie

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Great thanks. Anybody know where I can view hourly charts for June and before? Metatrader stops end of June for Hourly. Need hourly or less to see for sure if s/l is hit, etc as h4 is too risky not knowing.

Hello Micardo I would like to commend you on attempting to structure you own system to make some money. I was always told the best way to get something finished is to start. I believe once you are actually finished designing your system you will find it to be very profitable. I had one suggestion. I to also believe the best way to make money is forex is by watching price movement. I dont know how to use MT4 to back testing but I used to use a system on the 1hour chart where as you take previous bars high and low add them together then divide. Basically an avg of the previous bar. Once price moved beyond my avg I would trade in that direction and scalp pips. Sounds like you can do the same here. Lets take GBPUSD bar for last Tuesday the middle was 1.8671 the following day opened above the middle at 1.8697 the high for the day was 1.8739 difference of 40 pips you could have scalped. Then the middle for Wednesday was 1.8685 Thursday bar opened at 1.8674 so we would have been stopped out if we went short. but would have picked it up on the long side once we passed the 1.8685 mark. the high for thursday was 1.8798. So we would had made 113 pips minus the spread and 30 pips lost I think its like 71 pips and we can use ATR for exit or your 30 pip system or trailing stops for exit. What do you think about this.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Fixme that sounds really interesting... So let me understand this Lets say hypothetically speaking the high for today is 1.8900 and the low is 1.8800. So our average price is 1.8850. Now once the price hits 1.8950 we take a trade in that direction?. So what if the open tomorrow is 1.8970 do we automatically go long? Sorry I am a little confuzzled. Although it does sound exciting

--- 帖子 #64 ---
yes this is correct Micardo and just use your straddle system. Can some one do the backtesting on Mt4 so we can see the results. or tell me how to and I will do it

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Do you mean 1.8850 go long???? You wrote 1.8950 and now I am confused.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Markj When you say the 6am close is that on the 1 hour time frame? So the 6am close is the same as the 7am open. Correct? Jim

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thats correct. 6am close, 7am open on the hour chart. Possible filter for this strategy is price action on the daily chart and only trade the direction the the daily price action is indicating. Although I didn't use any filter just mechanically traded this based on the rules. You could decrease losses using a filter. Cheers

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Sorry dont mean to confuse you better explanation in my thread. "Elliot Wave Trading. I dont want to come in and bombard his thread. but yes the center point would be 1.8850 If open above this set your tp and sl and vice versa I added a lil spin on it though in my thread that would increase your odds.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I'm affraid i have only read the first few replies.... but u might find this interesting... GBP is held within 100% of the daily 7 period ATR 70% of the time, it is held within the 120% ATR 85% of the time.. this is something i am working on.. trying to use these figures to develop a system. Before i really get stuck in i need to give the ATR levels to my TS programmer to help with the testing. I would like to have these ATR levels on my charts anyway to help with strength of signal. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #70 ---
What is even more interesting about this at first glance is that it would seem as though the 30% of the time that it isn't contained Occurs consecutively, as does the 70%. What I mean by this is that ATR seems to trend and oscillate as Price does, an increase in ATR today would inply that tomorrow, an increase in ATR is also probable - over 50%. Where to go with this, I don't know!!! I'll give it a try. Howabout taking the RSI of ATR as opposed to price to determine points in time when an increase in the trading range is more likely, and using that as a filter for this range based system? Then only trade those pairs that fit these parameters. Also, although probably pretty scary to do, but with good Money management, perhaps it is possible, but when ATR is "Overbought" you would actually fade the Strategy.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Micardo's strategy here is excellent for people like me who cannot watch the market all day and night. It is based on "statistical probability" which will match all fib entries/exits, and any other trading strategy. It gives an edge because history has proven him right over a long period of time. Too much analysis can equate to trading paralysys. Keep it simple, like Micard's system here, and profits will come (and you won't have to sit in front of the screen all day).

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks Mike for your post... It is true what you say... The only stumbling block we currently have is the placement of the stoploss. As statistically speaking once the market goes past a certain point it does fulfil it potential nearly 70% of the time. However what we are currently trying to establish is exactly where we should place our stop loss so we dont get whipsawed.

The Center Point worked last nite for 50 pips on gbpusd

--- 帖子 #74 ---
hi everybody, iam a new member. so all work that we can do is in 0:0 GMT we get 2 order that 50 pips away from that price. is it correct?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
for this day we have a interest rate statement news in usa. if the position that i get in 00:00 GMT open , before the news, what can i do then? i must close it before the news or ...?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Markj, Would you manually close your orders if they didn't hit TP or SL at some point during the day, or did you let them ride out?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Ikholod, I would only manually close any open orders if they were still open NY close. A caveat to entry was if trades were closed out I would not open a new positions in the same direcion of the trade if the next candle crossed entry line. If you are considering a strategy like this then I would highly recommend you consider the screen time required and if it suites, or develop alerts. Cheers

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Mikejody, I dont have any problems with the strategy nor with the fact that you cant watch it all day and night. However do not say that statistical probability strategies work as well as any other trading strategy. Maybe as well as any other unverifiable statistical strategies. You have tested this strategy over a two year filter - making intraday trades based on a two year filter. Just to put things in perspective statistically, 3 years of hourly backtesting is equivalent to about 80 years of daily backtesting. Where is your population or your sample? 2 years? Are you telling me that that is what you are basing your trading on. Do you know how much marketconditions can change? You get annoyed with me for posing these questions and that is ok, I will stop asking, but please do not confuse my intentions. Overanalysis can lead to paralysis, but making that claim when you are trying to come up with a "statistically probable strategy" is very contradictory - your whole system is based on statistical analysis for christs sake! Avoid the analysis or over analysis or whatever you want to call it and all you have is a couple of guys trying to cheat the market and themselves by rationalizing reasons as to why they should avoid questions that put their strategies whole logical basis at risk. These and many more questions should be answered! However, if all you want is a reason to jump right in, hey go for it, but don't start a thread, just do it. I'll be waiting patiently on the other side. I am amazed by all of you! You try to statistically manipulate this market, forgetting how many market participants exist, how many are trying to do exactly what you are, and how many are smarter, faster, more creative, have backing, and are more disciplined. Not as an insult, but there are always smarter,faster,etc. With all of this knowledge, you fail to acknowlege one key statistic. 95% fail and Lose their money. If you dont want to be part of that one, I would seriously consider overanalyzing your statistically "probable" system. Best of Luck to you all.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Well, it looks like that you had no input on your trades except for setting them, moving stop to break even, and closing at NY close. This could easily be done with an expert. Have you thought about that, or is there some judgment call that you had to do that would invalidate my theory? In any case, thanks for you input.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Ikholod, No judgement call on this strategy. I traded to the rule mostly as I wanted to get results based on trading it mechanically. I was planning on adding filters to this strategy if it proved profitable. Hadn't taken any further i.e. EA as I have my head in another strategy at the moment but I believe it has potential. Cheers

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I've traded another breakout strategy called Hans123 for about 6 months or so. Perhaps you are familiar with it. It wasn't doing too bad. It was excelent during the trend and it didn't loose too much during the range. The one problem I had with it though, is that it set it's entry levels based on previous 4 hours high and low right at London open and NY open. So, of course when the market is mostly ranging, the price would get up to the entry level, put you into a trade and then reverse and go back. Your method is of course different where you set your level at 20 pips no matter what. Also, I think the 3 lot thing really helps to put the odds in your favor. At least I can say that based on the results that you provided I can see that you were making profits when that other system wasn't, and when there was a trend both systems were killing. So that's a good sign.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
anyone here to answer my question? just 2 hours remaind to interest rate statement news. i must close the position manually or leave them?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Right Mercardo, and I think the stop loss issue is a difficult one because we would have to be watching the market from the point of entry until close to see what is hit first, profit or stop loss. Right now I would just go with the results of your backtesting, as that is certainly sufficient, and try it with demo trades for awhile.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
No reason to get overly excited, swear, and rant and rave, as far as I can see. People normally hear us better if we are calm and reasonable, and if we do not appear to have a chip on our shoulders. I won't be replying any further to any of your posts, leaving you the last word if you prefer.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I think it would be really beneficial to have an MT Script for backtesting in which one could specify certain system parameters e.g.: 1) starting point e.g. 00:00 GMT, 5 pm EST etc 2) straddling points e.g. 20, 30, 50 etc pips from opening price 3) TP 4) SL 5) ???

OK here are my results for the past 5 days.... Thursday - +30 Friday - +30 Monday - +30 Tuesday - -50 Wednesday - +30 (At 00:01 Thursday, was still in trade so moved stop to within 5 pips and left to run) Early Days but lets see....

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I also have started a demo test with this strategy, with a slight variation, and these are my results so far. I have been substituting the 50pip rule start point with 20 pips and target is 30 pips. i.e. GMT + 1 (UK time approx 1.15am) price 1.8795 place long order @ 1.8815 SL 1.8785 place short order @ 1.8775 SL 1.8805 So far it has worked very well for the 4 days testing (+30 every day) but only time will tell. I am new to this forum having only just discovered it and would like to thank Micardo for his strategy and everyone else here for their input. I'm in the UK and our clocks change from BST (british summer time) to GMT this coming weekend. Does anyone know if EST changes? My charts are all based on EST. Thanks

Hello all, Executed my first GBP Range trade last night: Long 3 filled at 1.8808, S/L at -30 T/P on 1 at +20 T/P on 2 at +30 T/P on 3 at +63 (moved up from original T/P) Nice! Thanks to all here.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Nice People Nice, I think its important that we all post our results so we can all see which variation is most profitable. My trade was automatically closed today at 30 points profit which puts me at 100 points profit since last week. I will start to look at diffenerent profit levels with multiple lots

Ianj, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I would watch your risk reward ratio here with 30 pip stop. If you stopped here on all 3 orders you have a 90 pip loss + spread (105). Toady was a good day for this strategy but you will get choppy days. You have to protect you losses and concentrate on your winnings second. My experience was that a 20 pip stop placing an order 20 pips from the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st2 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st2:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st2 lace w:st="on"&gt;London&lt;/st2 lace&gt;&lt;/st2:City&gt; open was normally enough once orders were filled. Most of the time when orders were stopped out it moved the other way, breaking 20 pips below the London open. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Risk - 90 pips + spread &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Your example reward - 20, 30, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "QV10" /&gt;&lt;st1:bcv_smarttag w:st="on"&gt;63 - 113&lt;/st1:bcv_smarttag&gt; &lt;st1:bcv_smarttag w:st="on"&gt;&lt;/st1:bcv_smarttag&gt; &lt;st1:bcv_smarttag w:st="on"&gt; In the example you posted you will probably need to win 50% of the time with full reward to be profitable. &lt;/st1:bcv_smarttag&gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Of course in this strategy you can have partial losses and partial wins. But the above is just something to consider. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Does this strategy get full reward 50% of the time? (I would say NO) &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Is this strategy profitable protecting your losses and managing your wins collecting at profit levels and moving stops? (From my experience, yes over the last 5 months with a 20 pips stop). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Just my humble opinion. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Cheers &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Markj, It looks like you left both sides of the straddle on for a while. Did you remove the other side at some point, like when you took profit on the final order from the first side? Also, did you figure out if it is more profitable to leave both sides on, or to remove the other side as soon as one side opened? I did some manual backtesting a few days ago with a strategy that would place a stradle 20 pips away and then simply go for 20 TP and 20 SL, and what I found was that there was absolutely no benefit in keeping both sides out there. I made exactly the same number of pips if I kept it, or if I removed it as soon as one side opened. At least that's what I was able to figure out over the last 2.5 month of data. Not sure if it would be the same with your strategy.

I am not responsible for what you do after reading this. --------------------- The IDIOT system Hi all and welcome to the The Interesting Daily Intricate Opening Trade System. While you might think I am trying to poke fun at you here, and I might or not be, I may have just stumbled across the most dumbfoundingly simple way to trade cable Since I am not a big man of many words, let me get right to it: At midnight in GMT+2 (or at least I think I am in GMT+2, just assume Berlins timezone), you place a straddle on cable's opening price of the 1H bar for that time. Basically should be the same as the daily close, can vary 1-2 pips. I go off 1h. The straddle goes like this: 30 pips above and below the opening price of the 1H candle/bar for midnight you put buy and sell orders in that direction(below the price short, above the price long. Don't forget to add your spread). You then put the stop at the opposite orders entry price (so roughly a 60 pip stop). You then set a limit for either 100 or 140 or 200 or 240 pips away. Or you can complicate it to heck and back with indicators and fibs, be my guest. After looking back about 4 weeks, I can safely say that if one of the two orders gets triggered, one of two things happens: 1. The trade moves 100-240+ pips in your direction and you get a good R/R on the stop size. 2. The trade moves about 10-40 pips in your favor, then comes all the way back and continues the other way. It will almost certainly move in your favor first. Obviously nobody will have issues with case 1, and for case 2 it's rather simple: use a 60 pip trailing stop, not a fixed one. That way you lose less. You can also move up the stop to breakeven if you're anal about it, but that might just stop you out of trades early that then move on quite a bit. Losing is normal and natural and hence the take profit / limit points should at least be 150% of the stop size. Hence 100 pips being the smallest suggested. Well, er, that's it. Straddle away every day, make money, make some hay. Best application of how MM and risk management works for you in application ever. I came up with this because all these indicator based systems are just making me sick sick sick and this works at least as well as any bagosidomoutekisilvertigerfireriderwaterspoutermysticrivershijiujitsutunnelaikenshiakirawhatever. Also it gets tiresome to read a new thread every day asking "where do you think GBPUSD is headed"(with this it just plainly doesn't matter). Backtest this yourself(As in manually, not automated. Just use the crosshair.) on the MT4 charts on 1h if you think it's too silly to work Should at least work until the 300+ pips a day moves return for cable and then all you need to do is toss in cash anyway Good luck and remember, we can all be IDIOTs if we just try hard enough! SeekingLight P.S. If you are one of the persons that needs a reason as to WHY this works, I can offer you that most of the time that time area makes an inside bar and basically it's a straddle of just that(which is indeed valid)...oh and if you need an MT4 demo that's in that timezone, MigFX and Nextt are. P.P.S. Included fully mechanically backtested October via template, made on MigFX demo. PL ends up +210 with a theoretical open trade at +50 atm. Just open a GBPUSD chart in MigFX demo and load the template, it's fully labeled. 60 trailing stop loss was used, 100 fixed take profit point. PL should be a bit lower due to spread not being included almost ever. Saw at least two trades that wouldn't have been entered the wrong direction had one used 35 pips + spread instead of 30 distance. Further tweaking is more usefull with an automated program that would examine standard deviation to both sides from that offset. Don't look at me, I can't do that sort of thing.

Ikholod, I would set two 3 lot orders at London open. Lets assume the London open was 18800, set 3 lot orders to buy 18820, set 3 lot orders to sell at 18780. Lets say the first price gets to 18850 after breaking through the 18820 price. I would take profit one and two of the table and set profit three to brakeven. If the price then moves to 18854 before retracing to 18820 profit three would be closed out. If price then went done to 18780 sell orders would be place, if price moved only to 18760 then retraced to 18820 then only profit one would be collected, profit two and three would be closed out. If price then pushed back through 18820 again I would place 3 buy lot orders again. If price then reached 18900 then I would take all three profits of the table. If 3rd order was still there but hadn't reached 80 pips profit by NY close then this order would be closed for whatever profit is on the table. Result First move = 14 + 30 + 0 = + 44 Second move = + 14 - (-20) - (-20) = (- 26) Third move = 14 + 30 + 80 = 124 Total daily pips = 164 - 26 = 138 So the first orders are placed at the London open and left if both of these are hit proceeding orders are placed throughout the day if conditions are met. I my strategy I did not just take one 3 lot for the day, it could be upto 4 or 6. Hope helps Cheers

hey there seeking light... nice to see that there's someone who thinks along the same lines as me! i have been trying to find a "system" that doesn't require any complicated indicators, and is proven to have a positive expectancy, and to this end i have been experimenting with a similar method (also on GBPUSD) which i believe can be likened to an opening range breakout (please feel free to correct me if i'm wrong)... my understanding as to why this method works is that regardless of the trend, GBPUSD will tend to put in, on the average, a 120 pip range for the day. and since there are only 2 possible ways it can go, a straddle frees us from having to correctly decide on the direction. btw, this fella named Micardo has a thread on a method similar to this, i believe it's called the Daily Range Method or something like that. anyway, the only difference in what i came up with is the TP. i was thinking that, since most of the time, the trade will move 10 pips in your direction, why not take the 10 pips? i know that there will be a tendency to leave a lot of pips on the table, but if we can come up with a method that will practically guarantee 10 pips a day, we can just increase lot sizes (and therefore profits) exponentially. or, 10 pips on 5 lots, then trailing stop on the rest hehe. i hope you don't mind me sharing my ideas.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Ah, oops, so I made a third clone. Well, it was worth it for the title Anyway, goes to show that if you can come up with something, someone else prolly already did as well. Nevermind then, but hey, it's the thought that counts At least I took r/r into consideration I'll leave it to the other daily range thread then....maybe we should just delete this one *leaves it up to smjones* It was a glorious 5 Minutes while they lasted! *rides off into sunset on his Jolly Jumper...*

Maybe you could re-name the other thread "The Idiot Daily Range Strategy"

Naw lets leave it up for a while and see how it develops. They are all slightly different. Or if Micardo does not mind I could merge this thread into the Daily Range Thread. I just am loath to delete other's ideas... let me know, Scott

well, i think "The IDIOT System" has a better ring to it thank you for your very well prepared post, i'm sure the people at the Daily Range thread (and FF in general) will find it very useful, especially with regards to stop placement and take profit levels maybe we can merge the threads if everyone involved is ok with that?

Ah so this is where it went *laughs* Well just to be clear, no offense meant to anyone by the title of my superb IDIOT system Nor the indicator folks, lord knows they provide merry entertainment in the long FX hours. Like I wrote in my PPS, a simple adjustment of trailing stop and breakout size can change the results a lot, but experimenting on that manually isn't going to work as you need several months for any reliability. I just saw it worked for the last few weeks and thought I'd give people something to spend their idle time on Personally I am going to stick to learning price action and trendlines / naked trading *burns clothes and runs off into forest* Good luck all and remember that with all the misery there can be, life's also deeply ironic and smiling and laughing causes a better functioning immune system and fretting cancer, so take a pick....totally off topic I know, but I just wanted to share a reflection after today =) SeekingLight

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I hate to add to the "This strategy needs an EA" but I believe it would be worth while. EA idea!! - Variable setting for Entry Buy (i.e 20, 30, 40 etc from Time Setting ) - Variable setting for Entry Sell (i.e 20, 30, 40 etc from Time Setting ) - Variable Time setting (i.e London open, 12am etc etc) - Variable Lots (1, 2, 3 lots) - Variable Stop Loss setting (20, 30 etc) - Variable Moving Stop Loss (Once 30 pips is hit set new 30 stop loss) - Variable Take profits (profit 1, Profit 2, Profit 3) Any other ideas? Don't want to step on toes but from my experience the London is better suited. But various people will have different ideas so all these variables would suit others. The strategy I put down requires too much screen time to trade manually as you could be in and out of various orders throughout the day. Other strategies for this method are less reliant on screen time as they are just straddling two orders. I found that there can be quite a few fake moves before a big daily move. Any suggestions or comments? My preference is to trade manually and am working on other strategies that are better suited to this. I would hate to abandon this strategy if it is possible to trade with an EA. I think everyone who has imputed in this thread knows that this method can be profitable as it does not rely on any indicators and is purely statistical on price range. I do not wish to confuse all different variations but an EA with all different variables should suit most peoples styles Cheers Anyone know how to write this EA! ????????? Any suggestions

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Amen! ( can one say that, who's not into religious stuff?!) May I add MoneyManagement to this hopefully new EA... FT

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Markj, Thanks for the information. I guess I misunderstood the part that you kept on placing these orders throughout the day. So, what would happen if for example: London open is 1.8800 You place 3 Buys at 1.8820 You place 3 Sales at 1.8780 Price moves up to 1.8820 and 3 of your Buy orders go in. Then price proceeds to move down to 1.8800 and these 3 buy orders are taken out by stops. Then price moves back up to 1.8820 again. Am I correct that you would enter 3 more buys at this point? I'm working on automating this. I basically had it working with all of your rules except for this part that orders need to be replaced throughout the day. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
For this situation there were two rules that I followed. 1. I would not re-open an order in the same direction on the same candle 2. I would no re-open an order in the same direction on candle prceeding the close candle I would however open a new order on the same candle or proceeding candle in the opposite direction. I found that if the above two happened the market was too indecisive. (this was just my rule) I would note that I didn't see the order hit either way and get stopped in the same candle very much. However I would get stopped and it would break in the same direction the next candle but I would take it. Sometimes in this situation it would make some profit but most times it would play around the order level and retrace. If the second candle closed below the order price and the third candle then broke the order line I would take the order. There may be a better rule to use here but this is seemed to work. Hope helps? but note sure how you would automate this rule?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
This helps a lot. I was just discussing this strategy with my trading budy and we were thinking about what happens if this is going on during some big news item where price could easily jump up and down a lot. This rule of not opening on the same candle or on the next one in the same direction should take care of this problem. Alright, back to work. Thanks for all your help.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
On this note, which Timeframe were you looking at? I've had it running on 15 minutes so far. But, up to this point it made no difference since we didn't have to rely on this rule of counting candles.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hour timeframe

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I think all of this really depends on peoples ability to stay in front of the screen. If it is automated then I think it needs to be as simple as possible i.e. 00:00 GMT Place Straddle 30- 50 pips Away. Enter 3 lots and take profit at 3 different levels as mentioned. Stop Placement needs to be at least 50 pips away I think althoughy I could be proved wrong.... By the way have we come to a consensous yet as to the best entry and exits to this strategy yet? I have been demo trading close to my origional strategy of Straddle 50 pips away from GMT 00:00, Stop Loss at 50 pips and take profit at 30 pips. I made 100 pips in the last 5 days :-). However I am not happy with the fact that we need to be right more than 50% to make this profitable. I feel we are on the right track but we just need to tweak a few things here and there. I think the multiple take profit level is a great Idea. Lets just play around with this and keep posting our results. By the way, I just wanted to thank all of you guys for helping and contributing to this system. With all of us working on it we MUST be able to find away

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Regarding the news and trades missed. We can't get all the trades and this rule seemed to save money more than not but you could try without this rule.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I think it's a good rule. I could definitely see how it saves money.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Markj, Do you have an idea of what kind of drawdown you have experienced with this system? I see that you only had one loosing month, but I still wonder what I kind of loosing streak there could be. Just trying to set the number of lots correctly. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I have a question about "daily range" . . . say EURUSD has an average of 100-120 pips. Is this figured by just subtracting the daily low from the high and averaging a lot of days or are the retracements during the day also figured in to this calculation in some way. In other words, are we just concerned with highs and lows, or are we dealing with the total number of pips a currency travels during the day?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I have attached an example of the last 5 trading days using this method for a total of 397 pips. As I said I am not trading this method as to screen time intensive. But just as an example for others. The home line is the London open price. Line 1 is set 20 pips above open and Line 2, 20 pips below London open. No fancy formating just information. Hope helps for anyone wanting to look at this method. Cheers

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Ikholod, As for draw down assume 4 total losing trades which would be equal to 4 x 60 = 240. Thats for a bad day, assume 4 bad trading days in a row = 960. 4 bad trading days in a row did not happen whilst testing, 4 completly bad trades in a row, no profit collected, did not happen in my testing either. But I did have bad days. If I was to look at August and this was a bad month - 160 pips loss was the worst day and that was double of the next bad day for this month. No more than two consecutive losing days. I think the assumtions above are very worst case scenario. What I tested didn't come close to this much drawdown. Worst draw down for August was 220. Cheers

--- 帖子 #124 ---
yep, the states turn back the clocks an hour this weekend (most states anyway)

--- 帖子 #125 ---
what do you guys think of taking just 10 pips on multiple lots? if we could refine this system to make it practically guarantee 10 pips a day, then we can just increase our lot sizes to take advantage, correct?. also, this would make for a good EA IMHO. OR we could also take 10 pips on 5 lots, then set TP at the previously mentioned levels for lots 6 and 7. the 10 pips profit on the 5 lots would then be our "buffer" just in case our stops on 6 and 7 are hit. IMHO doing this would reduce drawdown, BUT it might also hamper profitability as we would not be maximizing those days when the market does move in our direction. anyway, i'd really like to know what you guys think of this.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I have no problem with taking just 10 pips.... My only issue is what happens in this case is we need 5 good trades to breakeven on one bad trade. Thats like nearly a 85% strike rate just to break even. But by all means if we can get a garenteed (if theres such a thing) 10 pips then I would be all in.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
...i love this method....i just stradle or OCO...55 pips for long and 35 pips for short position from 5ET(cable),always worked and i dont know why? its just probability....for 3 yrs now and made my first million like a year ago...like today i made more than 70 pips...just check your daily candlestic for today!

Natgo, Is this your scenario? 3 profit levels, 14, 30 and 80. Scenario 1 Place order for 7 lots: 5 lots take profit 1 (14 pips) profit of = 70 2 lots take profit 2 and 3 (30 and 80 pips) = 110 Scenario 2 If trade moves against us after profit one hit : 5 lots taken profit 1 = 70 pips 2 lots closed out with 20 pips stop loss = - 40 pips Still in profit after spread cost of (70 - 40 + spread 28 = 2 pips) Scenario 3 Total loss on all 5 lots: 7 lots closed out = - 140 pips Scenario 2 would break (approx) even after you cover spread costs. If we look back and scenario 1 was hit 30% of the time, Scenario 2 60% of the time and scenario 3 10% per 100 trades. Calculation: 30 trades = scenario 1 = ((30 x (5 * 14) + (30 x 30) + (30 x 80)) = wait, get calculator (70 + 900 + 2400 = 3370) 60 trades = scenario 2 = (60 x 30 = 1800) 10 trades = scenario 3 6,7 lot profit only = (10 x 2 lots of 30 = 600) Spread cost = (100 x 7 lots = 2100) If this is the case profit comes to ((3370 + 1800) - (600 + 2100) = 5170 -2700 = 2470 spread cost is a killer. So we if we look back and see that profit 1 was hit 90% of the time once it broke through entry line without retracing to the London open price (10 - 1) trades then this should work assuming price moved to 80 pips above London open 30% of the time. I guess the good thing about range strategies are they can be simple! so we don't want to complicate this (but if it works). In the end if we were to use just one order to collect profits at 14 pips assuming 90% per 100 trades = 1400 - 300 spread cost - (10% losing trades at - 20pips = 200) = 900. I'm starting to get confused here and I wrote this. Just trying to put to paper what Natgos thought were. Hope calculations are correct (maths was not my strongest point). Cheers

--- 帖子 #132 ---
People I ahev to say that I really like the way this is evolving. Mark your strategy sounds really good. I will do some manual backtesting on that this weekend. You know the great thing about something like this.... It removes the bigget single hinderance that traders have..... EMOTION!!! Once we back test these enough and we go live then it is simply a question of following the rules to the pip, if we can do that then happy days :-)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Micardo, I agree. I really think a great outcome from this thread would be a EA with different variables suiting different risk:reward ratios. Everyone will have different opions on how they want to trade a daily range strategy. But I think this can be a great mechanical strategy, taking out emotions etc leading to a profitable way of trading. As for myself I do not have the screen time to trade it how I would like thats why I would love to see an EA developed with changing variables to suite as an outcome. I do not want to change this thread from your stratgey Micardo so please let me know if you feel this is happening. Personally I believe the best strategies do not consist of indicators, indicators and more indicators. Would love to see other ideas for this EA as Jaroo commented, Money management to be added. Then we need a volunteer to write the EA as programming in C is not my strong point. Cheers

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hey Markj, Unfortunately Programming isn't mine either.... But regarding the thread, I love the fact that everybody is contributing. No one person can be right and different people have different experiences which is why it is so important for us all to share then like you say come up with and EA to implement what we all deem to be the most profitable strategy with the right risk reward strategy. I feel this will work once we find the right variables for the fact that non one can deny that the market has a daily range. These daily ranges aren't just random, people make the markets and for this very reason we can find a Pattern which over time is profitable. Everyone wins and loses, if we can win bigger and more often than when we lose then we can definitely make money in this market. Now..... any volunteers for the EA

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Micardo Great thread guys! This is all looking very promising, and I would feel comfortable I think trading a strategy such as this after testing - seems to suit my trading style.... Anyhow, have you considered asking AHA in the EA Factory? Maybe you could raise the subject and see if you could PM AHA if he does not mind... Wishing you continued success !! Angie

kamanda, what exactly are you sayiing? I am confused on 5ET(cable) - is that using 5am eastern time or what does that mean? you wait 55 pips to go long and 35 pips to go short, or you only try to get that many pips?

OK Today's results, well you guessed it.... I got my 30 pips for the day and finished off really quite a good first week. If only every week was this simple. I post total pip count for this week etc later tonight How did you guys do this week?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
lambert &amp; B rock...i'm more than serious with my method and it works very well(3 yrs now) not 100% though....today &amp; yesterday i picked up more than 100 pips from cable alone..the only pair i trade. i only use the closing price from the previous daily candle and +/- 55 &amp; 35...example (on thursday) the closing daily price was 1.8902 ..so i went long after 1.8902 + 55 (stradlle or OCO to make it automatic)....if you can check your daily candle from monday until today it was a very good week...and how i take profit? i always target 50 pips daily but sometime i can take even 10 depends on the day.

Last 6 trading days with this strategy. 20th = + 85 pips 23rd = + 124 pips 24th = + 18 pips 25th = + 46 pips 26th = + 124 pips Today = + 18 with third profit still in at break even. This trade will probably get closed at NY close today as it doesn't look like it will make 80 pip profit target. Should close for approx 30 pip gain making trade day total of approx 48. Would close this order now but this strategy is based on mechanical not emotional. Total pips = approx 445 depending on final lot close. Cheers

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Wow, Markj, They are some seriously impressive results.... How long have you been testing this for? How much of that is back testing and how much of that is testing in real time?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Micardo, Backtested this strategy over 5 months and traded in a demo. It works well but I don't have the time to trade it. As for the results above they are paper trades. This is what the strategy would have returned over the last 6 trading days if you hade been trading it. I posted a word DOC with examples of the last 5 days in a post further back if you want to take a look. Cheers

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Markj, Did u manually go back over the 5 months of charts?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Micardo, Just taking a look at the 24th (shitty day). Your result - 50 pips. I came out positive on this because I had a second bite for the day using my stratgey for 44 pips when it crossed again (20 pips up from London open) after 1st move. 1st trade moved against me after 1st profit was taken at 14 pips for a loss of - 24 pips, then 2nd move + 44pips for total daily take of 18 pips. Otherwise if you look at your results, the day, and the way the market moved you probably would have grabbed a lot more profit with 3 lots each trade. Cheers

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Yep, Took a lot of time. I experimented with different scenarios for the daily range as well and this seemed to be most profitable for what I tested.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanks kamanda.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Kamanda, Congratulations you are obviously doing something right :-). What sort of drawdowns can you expect? Also you say you made a million.... That is impressive, was that using this strategy only and was that in just 2 years? One last thing, I am confused about this 55 and 35 thing... When do you enter 55 or 35? You said the other 55 long and 35 short how dop you determine that?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Also Kamanda, Where do you place your stops? You target 50 pips, do you ever take anymore if so what do you do just trail your stop?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Markj, I've traded your strategy for the last few days, but the results I got today are different. I got +124 Pips today. Maybe we opened on the different candle? I opened at 7:00 GMT = 3 AM ET = 8 AM London I can see that if you opened at 7 London, you would probably be whipsawed, is that what happened? You said to place trades at london open which according to this document {link removed} is 7 GMT.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Ikholod, What do you have for the London open price?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Ikholod, If we look at the open and create Line one and Line Two we get, Line 1 = 1.8925 and Line 2 = 1.8885. Two orders of three lots would have been entered for the day: Order One 9 GMT when price broke line one and moved to 1.8870, which saw us take lot 1, profit 1 only for 14 pips. The other 2 lots closed out home line (London open) for - 40 pips. So this trade was worth - 26 pips. Order Two was entered when at 1500GMT when price broke reached Line 1 at 18925. We took profit 1 and profit two for a total of 44 pips and profit 3 was left riding. Profit 3 nearly reached target just prior to Londin close but would have been closed manually at NY close 22:00GMT for a gain of 52 pips. The total for the day would have been = (-26 from first trade and + 96 from second trade) = +76 for day. Second order only got as far as 76 pips from line 1 so missed 3rd profit by 4 pips. Cheers

Hi kamanda, I'm trying to figure out what your entry is, is it 55/35 pips from 5 am est, 5pm est, or gmt 00 open of new daily bar? And what stop size do you use? ALso if you dont' mind me asking which broker you use, I'm still searching for a good broker. thanks

--- 帖子 #155 ---
..STRICKO ..my entry time is always 5pm est just after formation of new candle(just to get closing price of previous candle)....i have diferent brokers but one is forex.com and they have this feature known as OCO(works best with this method)...my stop loss is 75 for long and 55 for short but it s very rarely for them to get hit (last time this happened was last payroll(10/6) remember that whipsaw?...my maximum drawdawn was last week 10/19 (68 pips) before it reversed for 135 pip! NB: when my stop loss got hit i always take different position and double my position (very risky but worked well...u need a stomach to do this)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Kamanda, Am I missing something here, Is it slways 55 pips for a long entry and 35 pips for a short entry? How do you determine this and how do you determin your stop? Are these just random numbers or is there a reason behind them?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Interesting kamanda - So I guess you keep your position open until 50 pip profit or stop loss is hit or do u use a trailing stop? If u keep the position open, do u place another 2 straddle orders the next day at 5 est?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
(Quote by MarkJ) If we look at the open and create Line one and Line Two we get, Line 1 = 1.8925 and Line 2 = 1.8885. Two orders of three lots would have been entered for the day: Order One 9 GMT when price broke line one and moved to 1.8870, which saw us take lot 1, profit 1 only for 14 pips. The other 2 lots closed out home line (London open) for - 40 pips. So this trade was worth - 26 pips. Markj, I'm new to this, but I had a question on Order 1 above. If we sold at 1.8885, it would have to drop 14 pips plus the spread to hit the first target. It dropped to 1.8870, so unless your spread is 1 pip, it would not have hit the first target, thus resulting in a -60 pips for Order One, not the -26 pips stated? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Kamanda, thank you for posting your strategy. Do you think it would be possible to clarify your traing strategy? It is confusing which is why you are getting all the questions about it. It sounds very much like "I OCO 55/-35 and wait until take profit, minus spread hit broker and stop loss." This kind of a post will only create questions. It is so important to be clear in communication, and the way we can tell if we are being clear is if we do not receive numerous questions after we post. I for one am really looking forward to hearing how you really trade. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I only joined this thread in the middle of the week, so my first trade was Thursday. So far, I am doing the strategy exactly as posted in the initial posts in this thread. In other words, at days end (5:00 PM ET on my platform) I enter 2 orders. The first is a limit order to go long at + 50 pips from the close, with a take profit order of +30 (from the entry) and a stop loss of -30 (from the entry). The second order I place is to go short if the market sinks -50 pips from the close with a take profit of 30 pips and a stop loss of 30 pips. My first trade on Thursday night was profitible. The market hit + 50 so my order triggered and then hit the + 30 take profit. This is how I am trading this system, as it works best with my schedule. I hope the post is clear so that it does not spark lots of questions simply because I was too vague to clarify in the initial post.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
... if i took 50 pips or more? yes,many times and sometimes less or negative because i dont use anything like trail stop...sometimes but not my favorite to do this , i lock in the first 15 or 20 pips(by putting a stop loss) and let it ride... is a sure thing of getting 20 pips but you can miss a bigger number of pips if ur stop loss got hit...sometime you have to understand the market,what if by 3 EST you have 15 pips profit and your target is 50...do u really believe ur goin to get those 50 pips before 5est pm? i dont think so...its all about probability(to me)!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Mike jordy,let me try to get this right 1) i enter trade after 5est pm everyday 2) i use the closing price of the previous day(from daily candle),example... closing price was 1880,so i'll go long at 18880 + 55pips =18935(enter long position at this price) and short position at 18880-35pips =18845(enter position at this price..worked well for me!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Kamanda - Do u close yesterday's trade at 5:00 the next day and open 2 new entry straddle orders even if you are negative for the day, or do u keep the trade open until it is profitable?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Markj if your backtesting and calculations are accurate: "I guess the good thing about range strategies are they can be simple! so we don't want to complicate this (but if it works). In the end if we were to use just one order to collect profits at 14 pips assuming 90% per 100 trades = 1400 - 300 spread cost - (10% losing trades at - 20pips = 200) = 900. " That is a big assumption - 90% win because if it proved to be true this would be the only trade that u need to do each day with this 90% winning percentage - even though the win/loss ratio profit/stop is not good, a 90% win percentage will overcome this, and combined with proper MM such as a lot stepping or martingale strategy the 10% losses can be overcome to virtually eliminate losses.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Great, thank you Kamanda for clarifying. Now to complete your system, can you answer the following questions? 1) How many lots (contracts, positions,etc.) you enter with. 2) What is your stop loss? 3) What do you use to take profit? Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
OK as I am unable to trade during the day at the moment I am going to continue auto trading with a profit target of 30 pips and a stop of 50 pips. I understand that other people have different methods so would appreciate it if they could continue posting their results and thoughts in the hope that we can eventually come to a conclusion on which version of the daily range strategy is the most profitable long term.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thanks Micardo, please keep us updated as to how you are doing. I am going to stick with the 30 pip profit target and 30 pip stop loss. The only other thing I am considering is using 2 lots instead of 1, and letting the second lot run, closing it at 5:00 PM Eastern time.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I'm a little confused with the London opening time. Now that Daylight Savings Time is over in the US, what time (Eastern) are you all looking at for the London session to base the GBP/USD price. Thanks guys.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
brick911 The time here in the UK is now exactly 13.30 - hope that helps u calculate the difference from where u are.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Theres 5 hours difference between london and new york

--- 帖子 #171 ---
kamanda: Thanks - just one more question - if u r down at 5est do u keep yesterdays position open?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Markj, Sorry I was away for a few days. I'm attaching the chart from my system with a cross of where I think you placed your trades. My broker uses GMT time and as you can see it looks like the trades were placed at 3:00 GMT. What I don't get is how is that London open? On Friday London opened at 7:00 GMT, now with the time change they went back to 8:00 GMT. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
...pipbird.... everyday is a new trade after 5 est pm,today doesnt look good for 50 pips (most of the time 50pips will be there before 10est am)...if ur target is 20 pips i'm sure you must have them already and closed your trade,my position is still open but cable is very slow

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thanks kamanda - I agree - take what u get today

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Kamanda, thanks so much for your input here. I am still a bit confused on where you get your "closing price of the previous day". Can I take 10/23 as an example? At the NY close on 10/23, 5pm EST, you would have gotten your closing price from "the previous day(from daily candle)" Are you saying you are taking the closing price for the 10/22 daily candle? Or are you saying you are taking the closing price of the 10/23 1 hour candle that closed at 5pm? Sorry for being so anal... but your results are so good I want to be sure I get your method right.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
INANJ...10/23 was monday,previous day was friday (10/20)..so you take closing price from friday daily candle....remember monday start 5est pm sunday to 5estpm monday.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Ok - here's how it went with +20/-20 from zero GMT last Friday and today. Fri 27th = -60 (got whipsawed out of both trades) Mon 30th = +30 I have noted that if I had used the London open (8am GMT and 3am EST) instead of 0GMT I would not have got whipsawed on Friday. From now on I will set trades to do both times to get a comparison if I can get up early enough. max

--- 帖子 #178 ---
OK today was a seriously slow day one entry was triggered but didnt hit its PT so at 00gmt I cancelled the trade that hadn't been triggered, entered 2 new orders and moved the stop of the open trae to within 5 pips which happens to be break even. Lets hope tomorrow could be better.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Kamanda! If I understand your strategy correctly you went Short Today at 1.8960 (Daily Close 1.8995 - 35). You were stopped out at 1.9015 where you opened at Long Position with 2 Lots with Target 1.9065 and Stop Loss 1.8940. Are these numbers correct? Then you made a big profit despite beeing initially stopped out. Congratulations!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Ok heres an update of today and the trade that occured yesterday... Yesterdays trade was closed at -12 pips..... Todays trade closed a few minutes ago with our 30 pips in the bag.... So far we are 18 pips up on the week. Still looking good

--- 帖子 #181 ---
....Parabolic you got it &amp; looks like you understand this strategy very well..just closed my position with 55 pip profit,but the difference is daily close,which broker are you using?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Kamanda.... Can I ask a question.... Why do you always go short at 35 and long at 55? What is the reasoning behind that....

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Parbolic and Kamanda, At the risk of becoming annoying.... where did you get the daily close of 1.8995. On my platform ( Oanda ) I can find no daily candle with that close. Oanda daily candles close at 00:00 GMT. The 10/27 (friday) candle on Oanda shows a close of 1.8983. From a previous post to Kamanda the 10/27 close would be the one used at 5pm EST Monday to set up the next trade's parameters. Again, forgive if annoying...but what am I missing here on the daily close determination? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I looked at the daily candle of Interbank FX. They use GMT. But if you open the trade at 5 pm ET this would be 2 hours earlier (10 pm GMT). At this time the price was at 1.9012. Is this closer to your value?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
..INANJ ..i use forex.com ,the daily close for monday was 1.9017....thats why i told Parabolic his daily close is different from mine.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Kamanda could you please answer my question as I have asked you quite a few times.... why 35 short and 55 long?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
For trading on Tuesday you have to look at the daily close of Monday not Friday.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
....not easy to explain that...got those numbers from historical data(daily candle) , experience &amp; probability.....for the record today is the last trading day for october,and out of 22 days of trading i was able to get 11 days 50pips or more for october!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
That sounds excellent... So what did you manage on the other 11 days? OK I understand about the historical data part.... So just for my info it is always 35 short and 55 long? Am I correct in saying youv'e been trading this way for 3 years?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
... other 11 days? loss,breakeven or less than 50 pips...like yesterday i took only 4 pips and sometimes no trade like 10/03.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Well today the +20/-20 from GMT again did not work very well - in fact like last Fri got whipsawed out of both trades with a 60 pip loss. However, today I also did +50/-50 from GMT, which is what I think you are doing Micardo, correct me if I'm wrong. With 1.8992 mid closing price at 0GMT the trade was executed at 1.9042 and got me 51 pips. So total for the day is -9. Micardo could you say what stops you are using. 30 or 50 pips? thanks max

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Kamanda..... So what was your total pip profit for the month? Max... I use a stop loss of 50 pips and a profit target of 30 pips. You managed to get 50+ pips today that is excellent, can I ask you what your exit strategy is?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
..Micardo...more than 600 pips and the best day was 10/02....if you understand my strategy u'll see that!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thank you Kamanda..... To be totally honest I don't understand your strategy completely but I am Learning :-)

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Max77, Have you tried setting you 20 pips entry lines from the London open. Please see attached. 2 trades of 3 lots would have been placed today. 1st trade took profit 1, 14 and profit 2, 30 pips, profit 3 was closed out for breakeven. 2nd trade took three profit levels 14, 30 and 80 pips. Total for the day would have been 168 pips. See attached Cheers

--- 帖子 #196 ---
My 2 cents: He got stopped out on the short trade and reversed the trade with double lots long. Looks profitable on my chart anyway FT

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Takes stones to do that kamanda - 55 pip loss then immediately double-up to make 55. How often do u have to do this where u hit your stop and then double up?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
...i know...last time was 10/02 and 10/06

--- 帖子 #199 ---
kamanda - about 2-3 times a month this happens? I am wondering if u didn't do this double-up and reverse strategy (may be too risky for me) and just took your losses on those days - what do u think this would do to your average monthly pip average?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi there Correct. In UK we were on BST (British Summer Time) which meant 08.00am was GMT 07.00 The clocks in UK changed back to GMT Sat 28th - Hope this helps Angie

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Micardo, sorry to say I don't yet have an exit strategy. I had set the trade without any limit and just happened to look at the chart about 3pm to see it up at 1.9096 and closed out manually at 1.9093. Markj, thanx for posting the chart. If I understand you correctly your starting point is the London open at 8am GMT. On my chart the 8am candle opened at 1.8967. So for the long trade entry point would have been 1.8987. It went up to 1.9026 before falling back. Do you mean that you wait until it hits your upward entry point again (in this case 1.8987) and then re enter the trade? Sorry if I've misunderstood but I'm trying to work out the criteria you use to get the two trades. Thanks for all the input here max

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Here is a spreadsheet based on 21 trading days. It includes both a bear run and the current bull run. The second page may tell a story. The average open-low regardless of where the bar closed is 46. If the bar closed down, the average open-low is 60. This means if 50 pips is the limit order, on average you would only get in a trade if the bar will close down, but will not hit the 30 pips. Conversly, the average high-open is 67, regardless of where the bar closed, and if it closed up the average high-open is 87. This means a 50 pip limit order, on average, will get you in a trade even if the bar eventually closed down. These numbers, though, are very close to the 50 you guys have been talking about, and if you can get a bias, maybe put the entry at 50 pips according to your bias, and 60 pip against your bias. Any other thoughts on this is appreciated, but interesting indeed. (Sorry- One of my columns was labeled wrong before)

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Max77, This system places trades as they hit either, 20 pips below London open or 20 pips above London open. This is not a two order straddle where you set two orders at seperate points to enter trade and thats it for the day. In this systems you may enter 1,2,3, 4 or even 5 trades in a day. But normally averages around 2 - 3. I then trade 3 lots when either line is reached with 3 different profit levels. 14, 30 and 80. Today their were two trades where the price hit the uper target line (20 pips above London open) First trade at 9GMT where price went to 1.9025 and I collected 1st and 2nd profit for 44pips the 3rd lot was moved to break even when 2nd profit was collected and was closed out on the 11am candle for breakeven. Second trade would have been entered on the 1GMT time. The reason it was not entered at 12gmt time candle is that I will never re-enter a trade in the same direction on the next candle when trade has been stopped. This second trade then took all three profit levels of 14, 30 and 80 pips. Total gains for this system, this month on paper, have been 1604. Total losses have been - 730. Hope this helps Cheers

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I was replying to the original thread #1 also. I know there are other ideas out there. This is a perfect "hedge" type system. If the market starts to go against you, open a reversal trade at the same time, say with double the lots and move your stops, etc. etc.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
mmmmm.... what to say about today? Well I got stopped out at 50 pips which I believe makes us negative so far this week. What can I say... The markets this week have been quite thin.... NFP.... could this be the reason. Is it best just to sit this week out? What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Today this system made 44 pips on the first trade. You could have taken a second trade for another 44 pips but this system has rules not to re-enter a trade in the same direction next candle after a stop. So it would not have been taken. Cheers

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Here is the chart.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
This is an indicator that I am trying to put together with my limited JAVA101. I am still trying to finalise the signals. No one has come forward regarding the development of an EA yet. So far trade is looking good for today. Profit 1 and 2 hit for 44 pips and profit 3 still in play. A possability profit 3 could be hit as it level with the high of yesterday. Cheers

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi People ok is it possible for someone to write a program to back test a few variations of these strategie's so as to let us know which is best. I think there are about 4-5 variations now. I can provide 1 minute data going back to 2002 that can be imported into Metatrader but I can't code :-). So if someone would be willing to do that then let me know and I will go through this thread again and write you technical specifications on all of the variations.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Micardo, I agree with you and you have laid down a very well thought out strategy here, Kanmanda has a different one etc. I thought it may have been possible to get an EA developed with different variables so people would be able to pick there own way of trading the daily range. Since no one has come forward to help with the EA I might start a new thread? I do not want to confuse two many different strategies for the daily range. And I don't want to takeaway from the stratagy you are developing and using. Cheers

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Markj its upto you but I really think it would be best if we back test to compare each strategy first then once we find this out we put get to work on that EA. Give a few more days if you can to see if we can get someone to come forward. You are in no way taking away from this thread.... You are definitely contributing a hell of a lot and it would be a shame to lose your insight. I am in the middle of the specs now and should have them finished in about an hor and a half. I will then post it so you can see and make sure it looks fine. By te way how dod you place your stop loss and also what exactly did you mean by "Second trade would have been entered on the 1GMT time. The reason it was not entered at 12gmt time candle is that I will never re-enter a trade in the same direction on the next candle when trade has been stopped." How could I turn that into an instruction for the backtesting/EA etc?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Ok guys here are the specs.... Not quite finished yet but nearly there. Markj and Kamanda, I think I have your strategies down correctly but could you please take a look and confirm. Also in particular could you fill in the red parts that are associated with your strategies. Thanks guys.... Hopefully we can get this show onthe road.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Micardo, Great. The worst thing that I wanted to see was a confusing thread regarding 100 different ways of trading the system. But if we can pull it into line and repost to the front of the thread, then great. Don't know about you but when reading some of these thread you lose interest very quickly when the system gets so many variations that it becomes impossible to follow who is trading what and the results. Regarding the 12GMT, 1GMT entry. A rule I adapted to this system was never re-enter an order (if it has been closed out) in the same direction on the next hour candle. It is however ok to enter on 2nd candle. The reason I applied this rule is that if an order is closed out it can rebound quickly only to continue down direction the next candle. A lot of the time a order stop especially if only the 3rd profit is left has a big move so is inclined to a temp reverse. I found waiting for the 2nd candle kept you out of a lot of false rebounds. Cheers

--- 帖子 #214 ---
To Be fair I completely agree with you.... I will try to find a way to put a summary at the beginning of this thread stating that there are four main strategies that are being tested on this thread. I'll also attach the complteted spec so anyone can quickly come in and have alook at where we are currently at with it. Also I wander if there is away to post summary results at the front of the thread as well. This way people can literally come in read the first post and be up to speed on the Strategies we are testing and their results. Merlin.... Is there away to do this :-)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Micardo, I completely understand yours, but on the other 3 you've left some questionable blanks. In Markj's strategy you have trade cancelled at xxx. What does this mean? What is "profit target strategy" mean? Is it fair to say that Markj's strategy is one you have to watch at the computer all the time, whereas the other ones can be setup? For some reason I thought the OCO he was referring to on the NY open strategy was an OCO for multiple trades in a day, so glad you cleared that up. Basically you only enter 1 trade a day with that strategy. Also, what is NY open now? Before NY open was GMT-4, now it is GMT-5, so I wonder if this affects the trading since GMT is GMT. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I love Markj's strategy. I get up for like 5 minutes in the middle of the night (eastern time zone), set my entry orders with the appropriate profit targets. I have an alarm system that I will set to let me know when one of the 30 pip profit targets is hit, or the stop loss. This wakes me up, so that I can reenter an order if a stop loss has been hit, or move my stop loss if a 30 pip profit has been hit. I wake up at 6:00 for work and see how things are going, and off to work I go. I get to work early so I can set alarms on my computer here at the office too. Of course, sitting in front of a computer anyway is very beneficial to me. I love that it can be mechanically traded though. One thing I am adding to it is moving the stop loss to lock in any profit (instead of breaking even) right before a news announcement like ISM, for example. That way in case it causes a big dip, I can keep that profit. If the news doesn't effect the pair in this way, I will put the stop loss back to breakeven, to allow the trade to breathe.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Llambert, The Blanks and writing in Red is where I need to the creaters of the strategy to put there input as it is not completely clear to me and I don't want to get anything wrong. Once I have this information I will collate all of the information and post a final guideline document. It is then our intention to find someone who code to back test these systems over a period of years to see which is most profitable. I'll then post the results for each of these strategies, hope fully with monthly summaries, Max Draw Down etc. The My friends we might actually of found a way of trading that gets rid of the emotions and you just simply fund your accounts, turn on the EA and watch your account grow :-)

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Ok understood. I am a programmer, but not in Metatrader (YET hee hee) so can't help with that. I have done some manual backtesting using your strategy modified. Actually liking what I see.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
OK..... I have someone who is going to back test our systems for us over a period of years and then will write the EA...... YAY!!!!!!! We need to provide him with details first though. SO Kamanda and Markj, could you guys both provide me with the following details please: Summary of Results for the past 2 months - Number of Trades: Number of Wins: Number of Losses: Amount of Pips Profit: Could you also complete my specification that I attached in the earlier post. Once I have all of this info then I can give this to the guy and he will backtest over a period of years and also write the EA for us.... then my friends we have our automated system. We just need to turn the key and watch it grow :-).

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Micardo, Here are the answer. Strategy Three&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; This system places trades as they hit either, 20 pips below &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;London&lt;/st1:City&gt; open or 20 pips above &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;London&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; open. This is not a two order straddle where you set two orders at separate points to enter trade and that’s it for the day. In this systems you may enter 1,2,3,4 or even 5 trades in a day. But normally averages around &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st2 ns = "QV10" /&gt;&lt;st2:bcv_smarttag w:st="on"&gt;2 or 3&lt;/st2:bcv_smarttag&gt;. I then trade 3 lots when either line is reached with 3 different profit levels. 14, 30 and 80. “Second trade would have been entered on the 1GMT time. The reason it was not entered at 12gmt time candle is that I will never re-enter a trade in the same direction on the next candle when trade has been stopped.” &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 1) Place Buy and Sell orders 20 pips away from London Open – 3 lots each&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 2) 3 take profit levels 14, 30 and 80 pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 3) Stop Loss is placed at the NY close. Stop for third profit is placed to breakeven when 2 profit is collected&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 4) the above recycles itself through out the day every time the price goes back below or above as it may be the entry price.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 5) All trades are cancelled at NY Close and reset.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Example&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 1) &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt; London &lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; open = 1.8800 so Buy 3 lots at 1.8820 and Sell 3 lots at 1.8780&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 2) Take profit on lot one at 14 pips - Take Profit on Lot &lt;st2:bcv_smarttag w:st="on"&gt;2 at 30&lt;/st2:bcv_smarttag&gt; pips – Take Profit on Lot &lt;st2:bcv_smarttag w:st="on"&gt;3 at 80&lt;/st2:bcv_smarttag&gt; pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 3) Stop Loss is placed at the &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;London&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; open. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 4) 4) If we are entered into a long trade and the market retraces back below 1.8820 and stops us out then a new order is placed again at 1.8820 with the same above parameters. The same is true if we are in a short trade and the market retraces back up and stops us out.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 5) All orders are cancelled and rest at NY Close October Total Trades - 37 Losing trades – 15 Number of winning trades – 22 Pips profit – 874 &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; September Total Trade – 27 Losses – 9 Winning Trades – 18 Pips Profit – 1132 I am presently finalising documentation and indicators regarding this system and will post here on completion. Great news regarding the EA. Look forward tio completion. Cheers

Results for today: 1 trade only with profit 1 and profit 2 collected and profit 3 closed at NY session: 1 - 14 2 - 30 3 - 46 Total = 90 pips Cheers

--- 帖子 #222 ---
MarkJ... NOt sure I understand when you place the stop losses. The statements above seem to not agree. Also, how much is the stop loss? 20 pips? Thanks for any help here.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Sorry Traderstone, My mistake in the reply to Micardos document. The stops are placed at the London Open which will be a 20 pips stop. The 3rd profit stop is reposition to Breakeven once the 2nd profit level of 50 pips above London Open has been hit. Cheers

--- 帖子 #224 ---
3)Stop Loss is placed at the NY close . Stop for third profit is placed to breakeven when 2 profit is collected&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Mistake and is suppose to read: 3)Stop Loss is placed at the LONDON OPEN . Stop for third profit is placed to breakeven when 2 profit is collected.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Markj, Forgive me for recapping my thoughts and understanding here. Hope I am not overdoing it, but want to understand your system. I live in the eastern time zone of the usa, so I would set up a trade at 3:00 am (I think right?) which is London Open. My broker has a 5 pip spread for this pair and I am trading a mini account ($1 per pip) If the 3am candle opened at 1.8800, then I'd set up a trade to buy 3 lots at 1.8820 (for simplicity let's say it is just a long trade and forget the sell)... If price gets to 1.8820 my s/l (which can be automatic with an if/then) is set to 1.8800 for all 3. If it hits, well I am down $75 (with spread). At 1.8834 I sell one (and net 9 pips or $9 due to spread). The other two get stopped out, so I am at $9 on one lot and $-50 on the other two for a net of $-41. (EDIT - fixed the numbers) However instead of being stopped out, if the 2nd lot reaches 1.8850, I am now up $9 in lot 1 and $25 (with spread) in lot 2. At this point I need to KNOW this happened so I can change my s/l to b/e or 1.8825 (so I net $0 with spread). If the 3rd lot reaches 1.8880, I have netted $75 on the 3rd lot. Now my total profit is $9 + $25 + $75 = $109. If any lot gets stopped out, you will manually enter new orders when "starting over" because the next hour candle may hit the +20 again, but you don't trust it, so you wait until the 2nd hour after the s/l hits to buy again. At the NY close (5 pm eastern) if no trade has hit or stopped, you close the trades. Is this it in a nutshell or do you add 5 pips (in my case) to each number to truly net 14, 30 and 80? Thanks

--- 帖子 #226 ---
llambert3: Thanks for asking these questions for me ;-)...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi llambert3, In a nutshell that is it. The first profit was set to 14 pips originally to cover spread and net profit of 10 pips (at the time 4 pips spread). Yes I do add profit targets of other positions to cover spread however this is a decision left to the individual trader and they will need to decide. I DO NOT ADD SPREAD TO FIRST PROFIT POSTION Different traders will have different spreads . My broker has 3 pips spread for this pair. M aybe an option of a spread variable in an EA. This could then be added to the hard coded take profit positions. Cheers

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Markj, Just to confirm that e.g. with your broker (i.e. 3 pips on the cable), the first price target is 14+3=17 i.e. the price has to advance 17 pips to get TPed, correct?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I think he is saying 14-3 = 11pip profit. He is only adding pips to 2nd &amp; 3rd, but he can answer for sure.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Manul, I set my 1st profit at 14 pips. I would only add spread cost to 2nd and 3rd profit positions. The reason for this is that once price moves into 2nd and 3rd profit positions it is gaining momentum and rarley stops there so adding spread to profit target 2 and 3 will not see you miss many of these positions. However the first profit position is more fragile as market has not yet made a definite move and adding 3-5 pips onto the 1st target could see you miss a few of these positions. So if you decide to add spread to profit targets and your broker spread cost is 4 I would suggest the following: 1st Profit - 14 2nd Profit - 34 3rd Profit - 84 I am in the process of finalising some detail documentation and indicators to go with this system. I will post here when complete. Cheers

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hey Guys ok I have varied my strategy slightly.... I found that just taking a straight 30 pips profit or 50 stop loss although profitable could definitely be improved. So The new strategy is same set up but you trade 2 lots. and 2 profit targets.... 30 pips and 80 pips. The stop loss is still 50 pips. Once the first profit target is hit you move the stop to break even and wait till second target is hit or 00:00gmt. Also I have also added the fact that you can re-enter. But only if you get stopped out before hitting your first target. If you have already hit the frst target and then get stopped out on the second lot at break even then you leave it. Results for the past 2 months are: 39 Trades 26 Wins 13 Loss Profit pips - 1924 Loss pips - 996 Total P/L: +928 for the two months. Not to bad huh :-) Ok Just waiting for Kamanda's feedback then we will get started on back testing over a period of years, and developing the EA

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Thanks for organizing everything Micardo. I think an EA where it is possible to set your own variables like stop loss, take profit points, and distance from open etc. similar to what MarkJ had laid out would be incredibly promising. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi Markj, Thanks very much for sharing and explaining your strategy (also to everyone else posting and testing strategies!). I was hoping you could clarify a few points. The first sets of orders at day open seem pretty clear. I have some uncertainty about your reentry rules and a few other questions, if you don't mind... 1) Say your first shorts get stopped out (all 3). After the 2-candle grace period is over, the current price is below your short line from the beginning of the day. Are you entering anyway (possibly with new tp's and s/l) or do you wait for an actual crossing of the short line to occur after the grace period is over? 2) What if the 14/30 TP's are taken, but the 3rd stops out at breakeven--is the 2-candle reentry block still in effect? 3) Are you making decisions only at the close of an hourly candle or are you trading while each candle is painting? Does a candle have to close past one of the decision lines (the +20/-20 lines drawn at start of day) on the hourly chart or do you trigger your buys/sells by the minute? 4) On the word doc you attached earlier covering 5 days in October, your start lines are marked at 06:00 on your terminal. I matched your candles to mine and it seems to me that 06:00 on your terminal (and mine) are actually GMT+2. That would make the start time of the day in your examples 4 am GMT (with the day's centerline price taken as the close of the candle at 4:59am). Is that how you traded the system during testing or did you make a mistake with the word document? I hope all of this makes sense. Any additional examples/screenshots you could post would also help to make the rules easier to understand. It's difficult to code an EA without every last little detail pinned down. I don't think I understand completely yet because all of my tests are showing a very negative expectation (except for those last few days in October which were good for your system and for whatever craziness I have coded so far).

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Sorry if this has already been mentioned but what currency pair would this strategy be best suited for? The results you've made so far Micardo, are those with a specific currency pair? The GPB/USD perhaps since it is more volatile?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Funbot, Hope this answer your questions. Cheers

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Ronyn thats correct I have only tested it on GBP/USD. You are welcome to test other currency pairs though.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thanks funbot for asking those, I was about to write the same things as it appears today's setup has done exactly that, so that is why I am posting what I see on the charts to see if I got it right. I found out London is GMT (now that dst is over), so I think the London open is 8:00am. My charts are based on GMT anyway. Open price = 1.9064 Buy price = 1.9084 (happened on 8:45 15m candle) 1st TP = 1.9098 (14 pips forgetting spread - happened on 9:30am 15m candle) S/L set for all 3 lots is now 1.9064. 2nd TP = 1.9114 (30 pips - had I added spread like Markj says he has been doing but leaves it up to the trader, it wouldn't hit because 1.9115 was the high) 30 pips hit in same 15 min. candle as 1st TP. S/L now set to 1.9089 to b/e on the 3rd lot. 3rd TP = 1.9164 (never reached. S/L of b/e hit on 10:45 15m candle.) 5 pip spread Profit = +9, +25, 0 = +34 5 pip spread adding spread to lot 2 and 3 Profit = +9 (1st lot), and then we are still in trade because 1.9064 has not been seen since initial buy. If it is seen, then -50 will occur, causing a net -41 for this trade. RESTART (ONLY if not adding spread to lot 2 and 3) Since 3rd TP hit on 10:45 15m candle (which is 10:00 H1 candle) I ignore the 11:00 H1 candle, which is good thing because it never really did anything. The 2nd H1 candle (12:00) opened and has stayed above the new buy level of 1.9084 at first, but has since reached a low of 1.9082, and as of this writing is at 1.9088, so we are now in a new buy and starting all over. Markj, if I have all of this right now, I won't bother writing and explaining again, as this scenario which played out live will cover any questions I believe. At least until I find something else.. hee hee

--- 帖子 #238 ---
OK People I have finalised mine and Mark's Strategies with results.... You can see attached for the complete how to guides :-). Markj could you have a quick read through both the strategies and just make sure they are consistent with your thinking. If they are ok I will then give them to the guys who will back test over years and then creat an EA. Also Kamanda.... When you get a chance could you please provide that info so I can get yours put into an EA as well.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
What pairs have you tested this on

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I just read your instructions and it is similar to something that I have been using as well. What pairs does each system trade? Is it only the EUR/USD?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Micardo, I read your strategy documents - very nice, btw. I was curious what the results were regarding first profit target, for both yours and Markj's system. What was the percentage that these were hit before being stopped out on both systems? In a previous reply, somebody had mentioned loading up on the first pt, if the stats were there. I wanted to see if there was any validity to this. Bob

--- 帖子 #242 ---
These are all based on GBP/USD. Brick I cant speak for Markj.... But for me all the winning trades hit the 1st profit target. So that would be 67% ish. I have the complete figures at home regaring the percentage that then went on to hit the second Profit target. But I found that by trading 2 lots you could have consistent wins... but at the same time not miss out on the bigger moves. Hopefully we will get the complete 2-3 years back test by newt week. Thanks guys for following this thread.... I appreciate the interest and feedback that we are receiving.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
That's much lower than Markj's 80% - 90% for the 1st profit target ..... Sorry for chiming in but couldn't resist.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
That's true, but here's the math... Let's keep it to 100 trades for simplicity. Micardo - 100 trades at 67% pt hit multiplied by 30 pips = 2010 pips Markj - 100 trades at 80-90% pt hit multiplied by 14 pips = 1120-1260 pips I think they are both good strategies that can be applied to the individual's situation, comfort zone, and capital. Does that sound right, guys? Geld - I also have a ball python and a corn... they aren't as exciting though. Bob

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Brick I agree it is really down to the individual.... Geld you have to look at it like this.... Winning percentage is really irrelevant, it is how much you win when you win in relation to how much you lose when you lose. I have heard some people say they are happy with a strategy that only wins 40% of the time cos when hey do win they win big. It also has alot to do with you psychology.... some people need a high win rate to keep their confidence up and the head in the game... others like above are not phased by losing 60 trades out of a 100 because they are so confident in their system that they know when they do win they will more than make up for it. As brick said it is down to the individual. I personally think Markj's method is brilliant... I mean results like his.... 2006 pips in 2 months (2006 mmmm spooky:-) )thats incredible even for the most experienced trader. But the fact is different people have different comfort levels and are partial to different strategies. With Markj's you get alot more trades and if we didn't have an EA then it would take alot more time to monitor. With Mine still requires screen time but perhaps not as much. Anyway people hopefully i'll have an EA for you before long and back tested results of a few years, then you guys are free to play how you like :-). As long as we all make money I'm Happy

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Micardo, can't argue with that. Thanks for all your efforts here.

No problem, Glad we could help

--- 帖子 #248 ---
As someone new to the Forex market I have been following this thread with great interest. I have been gradually getting to grips with the trading setup of this system and my understanding improves with every message on the forum that I read. The results look amazing! I would like to thank all the members for all the effort they are putting in to improve and explain the workings of the system but most of all sharing it on the forum to beginners like me. I see that Micardo will produce an EA for this system, I would be very grateful if someone could tell me what an Expert Advisor is. Noel.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
it is basically atrading system that when applied to the MT charts will place trades and update stops and take profits automatically for you...

great results micardo, which pairs was that on.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Pips don't mean sh*t! It could be the case where % profitable (how often it wins) and/or win/loss ratio (average winning trade divided by average losing trade) is FAR more important to a system than net pips. Money management is what makes a good system great and it doesn't always just like pips, its likes other things as well. Pips are for people to brag about, but they arn't where the money is most of the time.

All looks good Cheers

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Ok I have an EA that I think is following the rules as I understand them. Hopefully Markj will be willing to take a look and let us know where the EA doesn't follow his method. I'm assuming there is a divergence somewhere because this EA has a negative expectation. Please note this is a very unsophisticated EA which does no input error checking, etc etc.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
funbot, maybe I am not one to test an ea as I am not that familiar with backtesting with one through MT, but I tried to do it for 10/1/06 to 10/31/06. I see the chart and the results. The very first one in October, which is 10/2, I just can't see how you got the numbers to buy. First, wouldn't we be using the 9:00candle (GMT+1 for London Open)? DST was in effect then and I believe that was what London was. Even forgetting that, if I am wrong by an hour or it was really GMT, the 7am, 8am and 9am candles open was not what you are using, which seems like you are using 1.8728 as the open. The ea is saying to buy at 1.8748 and it did at 10:23, but on my charts, the highest price it ever got to was 1.8746. I can't figure out what is happening. Anyway, I only looked at this one trade and since I can't get it working by my manual test, then I won't go any further. Please let me know if you don't see what I see. Thanks Funbot for your help.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Good info to consider in this month's Currency Trader Mag. http://www.currencytradermag.com/bem684.htm Euro by the numbers p. 12. Jim

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Funbot, I appreciate your efforts with EA. As IIambert has said when there seems to be quite a lot of discrepancy in results when compared to manual backtesting. I campared results from start of October until current and a lot of the EA results do not compare correctly. Anyway as An example I have taken on of the days and inserted the chart. The EA calculated only 1 and 2 profit when manually testing it should be taking profit 1 x 2, profit 2 x 2 and profit 3 x 1. I will be out for a few days but will take a look at the code and see if I can spot any problems. Cheers

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Funbot, Just had a quick look and one of the errors seem to be that if a buystop is placed at the start of day, buy trade is triggered and takes a profit it does not re-issue another buystop. It does however re-issue a buystop is place, trade is entered and all 3 lots hit stoploss. I will have a further look when I get a chance. Cheers

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Ok thanks for the feedback everybody. I just woke up so give me a few. I was so wrapped up in numbers I neglected to mention a couple of key details, and I'm sorry about that. The main one for now (while I examine the comments you guys made in further detail) is that the EA has several 'inputs' you can set--but they're hidden within the EA. I made them that way after I discovered the backtester doesn't necessarily respect inputs set directly in the code and compiled (it allows you to bypass them completely with the 'expert properties' button). For those that don't want to open the code to examine, here is the version with normal, visible inputs. The inputs include the hour (0-23) from whose previous hour close you set the base price, the hour you want to actually start setting up buys and sells (I think Markj uses the same hour for both of these-I split them out for testing/fun), the 'close' time for the day, the buy line/sell line offset from base price for each day, TP1,2,&amp;3, etc... If you change them, please make sure to observe basetime&lt;=starttime&lt;closetime and stay away from midnight until I make sure the code can handle input errors and day rollovers properly. &lt;CLOSETIME, class=inlineimg title=Smile alt="" border="0" src="http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/images/smilies/smile.gif" Thanks again for the feedback, I'll have more for you in just a bit! *note--LotSize is size per EACH order. eg lot size of 1 would result in 3 1.0-sized longs and 3 1.0-sized shorts. I was using 0.1 in testing. All of the Offsets/SL's/TP's are to be given in pips. eg Mark used 20 for all of BuyOffset,BuySL,SellOffset,SellSL. BuyOffset and SellOffset are pip offsets from the baseline where you want the Buy and Sell lines to go. BuySL and SellSL are offsets from the Buy and Sell line for your stoplosses. SLOffset determines where you move the third order's SL after profit of 1 and 2 are taken. 0=breakeven, 5 would lock in 5 pips profit, etc.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hmm ok the forum software is deleting part of my reply! I think the only part missing is to ask you to stay away from using midnight in the times for now, and make sure the CloseTime is later in the day than the StartTime and BaseTime.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Alright I'm having coffee and can address some of the feedback now. llambert3: I think most of your question is answered with being able to set your BaseTime in the inputs. Whatever hour you specify corresponds to the hour on your terminal's server. For instance, if I use 10 as BaseTime, 10:00am=8:00am London Time in my terminal...Also keep in mind your spread difference. Buys are triggered on Ask price--so for instance if your spread is 5 and your BuyOffset is 20, a buy is triggered at a BID distance of 15 from the baseline for the day. The bars you see painted in the charts are all BID prices. This is one of the reasons why I split all those variables out into inputs. Markj: Could you please include the dates/times on your charts? That way I can run the EA and physically look at the same chart you are showing and figure out what is happening. If it's easier I only need your explanation and the date. I ran the EA for October and I don't see the problem you brought up regarding not replacing a buy order after 3 profits are taken. On October 6th I see it did just that. Could you give me a date I can look at? Thanks again for the comments! I don't mind working on this until it is working according to the plan exactly.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
funbot, and sell triggers?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Sells trigger on the bid line. Is that what you are asking?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thanks.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I apologize for asking once again, but I'm still a bit confused here. Perhaps I give an example to understand it better. Let's assume that I wish to have a trigger of 20 pips on both sides with a spread of 5 pips. So the "long"-trigger is 25 pips ... correct? And the "short"-trigger is also 25 pips or 20 pips or just 15 pips? Many thanks in advance for your assistance here.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
On Buy Stops always add the spread so if 5 ticks spread it should be 25 On Sell stops do not add the spread so it should be 20 This is to Open the Order for the Day For the EA After the order is entered as outlined below. For the Orginal Buy Stop putting on the Sell Stop should not add the Spread For the Orginal Sell Stop and Buy Stop should add the spread , if 5 should be 25. Input into the EA using the Spread of 5 (as an example) BuyOffset 25 BuySL 20 Sell Offset 20 Sell SL 25

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Many thanks, txsundevil! I really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I have only read about half the posts in this thread but there is one thing that no one seems to have taken into account. If you actually look at the charts a lot of the time your entry triggers won't be hit until 0930 London time - immediately after some UK data. A lot of your trades would unintentionally turn out to be news straddles - with all the problems of no fills and slippage that goes with it. No amount of backtesting or demotesting is going to solve that problem.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I have noticed with the default settings of the EA that slippage was listed at (1), I moved it to 4. I don't really know how it will affect the EA, but since I am forwarding testing it, we will soon know. If this EA is exactly like described in the document and is a clone of what was backtested it appears it may be profitable, since it gained over 2,000 pips in two months?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hey there "O", Just been through your thread and I like the simplicity of it, good stuff. Just like a well kept house, clean and not too much clutter. Also I think its awesome that many different mindsets come on and make great observations on what is a great method. Congrats A

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hello, I've been contemplating pretty much the same idea of this thread for the past few days. I am referring to strategy 1 of entering trades after they've moved 50 pips from the open. I have a couple questions though. I have a different way of thinking. I'd rather find a strategy that is very reliable and applicable among many currencies. Unfortunately I don't have an EA capable platform, gft, so I can't backtest. I'd much rather increase my likelihood of success by taking only 5 pip profits each day per currency. So if I can get this working among 4-5 currencies and pulling in 20-25 pips a day, 100-125 pips a week, 400-500 pips a month, all is fine and dandy. Yes I know that is under perfect scenerios and not entirely likely. I'm wondering though, how often would we reach success if we did only take 5 pips after a move of 50 from the open. Would it be enough such that there are many more days of perfect scenerios than those with SL hits? With a SL of 20, if we have one currency out of 5 hit the SL and the others make up for it that day. We'd scrap the day in hopes tomorrow is back to perfection. Or we would have a 40 SL to make it up in 2 days. This would protect us from being stopped out to let another winner form. Then there are the days when we leave both buy and sell orders open such that we either win in both directions from extreme volitility or we win on one to help compensate for the 20 SL. These are things I have to think about. Basically, what is the feasability of taking just 5 pips from this strategy? I know I'll catch flak because of the whole risk/reward crowd. Oh well. This all comes back to the varieties this strategy can take considering all of our different trading personalities and goals. My goal isn't very big. 5 pips a day on a currency can accomplish it. I just want consistent returns. Please give your opinions. Thanks. Matt

--- 帖子 #273 ---
What time in GMT is the London open and New York close? TIA.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hehe....I hope no ones posting because if you're using the strategy your orders just went through and you're watching intently. I made out with my 5 pips in about 10 seconds. I was in the profit before I could tell my order had gone through. Anywho, any opinion on my just taking 5 pips?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
You'll need an extremely high win rate and a reasonable stop loss level...let me know if you can find a system with both of those! In addition, you have to consider your spread. You have to overcome the spread before you can gain the 5 pips, and add your spread cost to your stop losses. With a 5 pip profit target, the spread is a very signicant...probably = to 40-100% of your target (2 to 5 pips). Last thought: better seriously test this or any other system for both of these criteria. This system may work well for what it was designed for, but that doesn't mean you can start using it as-is for something completely different and expect great results.

Thats what has me thinking. Really what these strategies are trying to do is place ourselves in a position such that our trades are within the body of the candle and in the direction of it. If its an up candle we're probably in a long position and vice versa if its a down candle. I take from this then that the 50 pip straddle is really to get our trades out of the irregular counter trend shadows that appear opposite the direction of the candle. i.e. a shadow above an open for a down candle and a shadow below an open in an up candle. For increased success rates all we need to do is increase the straddle. It's common to see a shadow of 1 pip in the counter trend, but is it common to see a shadow of 70+ pips? It's very common to see the candle bodies 70+ pips however. The straddle is really just a filter to filter out the counter trend and find the actual trend of the candle. A simple answer to your post would be to test out increasing the straddle from 50 to 70 pips. It would require 79 pips of movement to achieve my 5 pip goal, which is reasonable for a candle body to accomplish, but not the shadow. When we do this we are adjusting what we're willing to accept. With a 70 pip straddle we're likely to have several days where no trade is triggered. Would you rather have no trade or a losing trade though? The problem however is when we get to a 70 straddle we are making a lot more situations where the candle can stall and we're stuck with an open trade only a few pips short of it's TP. Yesterdays candle in gbp/usd is an example of this. Today might be forming the same way. It's all up for debate, but don't we have the same situation when we have the 50 pip straddle? Perhaps somewhere inbetween 50 and 70 pips is a better fit. It's all about the marginal benefit we receive from waiting for that one more pip. Where is the tipping point between filtering out bad trades at 50 pips and putting us into more situations of stalled candles at 70 pips? For SL I would probably just use a hard 20 or 30 SL. I've live traded the past two days using the 50 pip straddle and my 5 pips is usually hit within seconds of opening the trade. Trading multiple currencies like this could easily overcome a SL hit here or there which is what is expected if the probability of success really is very high in this system. Matt

Take a look at Friday the 3rd of November. On first appearances your strategy would have worked and on a demo account it probably would have worked. Then you realise that with the price at 1.9080 at midnight GMT your 1.9030 sell order would have been hit straight after the NFP report. Theoretically you could have made 30 pips profit because the price went down below 1.90. In live trading it would definitely not have been profitable. Either you would not have been filled or you would have been slipped and filled below 1.90, ending the day with a 10 pip loss. The same thing would happen with a lot of your trades. Have you heard of news straddling? It doesn't work! Most of your trades in this strategy turn out to be news straddles.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I guess this is highly dependent on your broker as well. For those who have been trading similar strategies on a live account, like kamanda, what broker do you recommend?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Notouch, That really isn't entirely true and I have looked and forward tested this strategy quite a bit and so far it seems to work. I'm not saying it is sure fire but it is going well so far. By the way I am able to get filled on an order almost to the pip....... Also have you noticed how everyone in this thread has been helpful.... They may offer criticism but they also offer suggestions on how to improve it, why is that you are jusy coming to kill the strategy and not trying to help?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Micardo, Would appreciate your opinion on my very low profit targets since you have a lot of experience in this strategy. BTW, todays candle would have made my 5 pips even with a 70 pip straddle. Had a nice late night push. Still, perhaps 60 would work better. Who knows? Matt

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Is anyone getting the EA to work (GBPBreakout) not working on my Platform did not generate any trades all settings checked out, or must the EA be complied before running it.?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
The pdf below gives some statistical values for all types of moves. Perhaps it's helpful for us to find the best parameters.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Very interesting. So then would I be able to assume that on a daily chart for GBP/USD if I just want 5 pips I'll be able to get it 95% of the time just by using a 10 pip straddle? This is relatively the same as waiting for a 50 pip trigger and getting the pips then. Although the 50 pip trigger day chart success rate is .8% below the 10 pip trigger. Would be nice to explore if the 50 pip trigger has less a chance of getting stopped out if we use a 30 pip SL to protect ourselves in a 5 TP strategy. Using their numbers though, at 95% accuracy at being able to get 5 pips when triggered after 10 pips, we would be able to profit 325 pips out of 100 trades. 95 winners at +475 and 5 losers at -150. SL of 20 might be fine. With a 10 pip trigger we're guaranteed to hit one side of the trade and win every time however. So really with a 10 pip trigger for daily chart when we hit a SL of 20 and it reversed then the other trade has already been triggered and is likely to take profit so each time it happens its really only 15 or 25 pip loss depending on if you used a 20 or 30 SL. So really its +400 off of 100 trades. Thats also not considering times when it would be profitable on both trades considering the ease to hit both versus the difficulty to hit both successfully in a 50 pip straddle. Some things to consider although I am not so sure if I'll straight up believe 95% accuracy. We'll need to look into it. Matt

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Matt, that's a point. We must verify the accuracy of these numbers. Nevertheless their statistics seem to be quite reasonable, IMHO.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Permanentjuan, I feel that if you could get your strategy to a high win percentage then excellent. A few pitfalls are and im sure you've heard this a thousand times before: 1: Yes there is enough movement easily at least in the GBP/USD market to make 5 pips a day (Average range is 140) 2: Stop loss placement is the key to this success. As with my strategy in theory when you look at a daily chart only, it cant lose. But you need to take the daily noise into account as this can often stop you out. Maybe a good strategy would be to put triggers in at London open a few pips above and below daily support and resistance. Then put you stop the opposite end. So for example... you have a buy trigger in at 5 pips above daily resistance, your stop loss for that trade should then be 5 pips below daily support. This way you are giving the trade room to breath but at the same time saying that if my buy is triggered then it retraces below the days low then I will come out as it is likely to break to the downside. I dont have the exact figure but something to this effect could work. I also trade breakouts and these are all things I consider when trading... hope this helps.

...try to stradlle at 55 &amp; 35 (long &amp; short) just after 5pm est and target profit 50 pips or more, works well with cable ....check your daily candles for this november...you'll see 2 days (out of 5 days) of 50 pips or more profit .

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thanks for hint Kamanda how you figured out 55&amp;35? What about SL for short and long? Do you use broker in USA, sometimes closing prices at different platforms differ. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Can someone post a chart example of how the second strategy would have traded on Friday. Unless I'm wrong, you would have been whipsawed to death that day, correct? My London open price was 1.9091. Price later hit 1.9111 on the next 1 hour bar. That would have got you long with a stop at 1.9091. Stop was hit on the next bar, so that's -20 on 3 lots (-60). You then enter short on the same bar when 1.9071 was hit. The stop on that trade was then hit at 1.9091. So that's another -20 on 3 lots (-60). Another short signal came later when 1.9071 was hit again, and went on to make +14, +30, and +80. So that's +4 for the day excluding spread.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Kamanda, I have a couple more questions regarding your 55/35 range strategy. Do you monitor it throughout the day and night as it progresses. Or, do you set your OCO orders and Take Profit and Stop Loss levels and just let everything ride? Also, you mentioned that sometimes you'll just get 10 and other times up to 50+ pips. When it has moved up to 10, do you move your StopLoss to lock in profit? 1 more: If you were to make 10 pips on the "buy" side and then it reversed and triggered your "sell" level (35 pips from open) would you take that trade and double up, or would you let it go, having already made 10 pips for the day? Thanks again, B

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hmmm ... Interesting thread.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Thanks for the suggestion. I will look into that later. Again, I'm only looking for 5 pips to get myself going. I've been theorizing strategies for several weeks now and realize I just needed to get myself back into the game. So with my spare time I'm doing the simple straddle system to get 5 pips a day.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately that's not what I'm looking for. I too am looking for a system where an EA could be applied. So looking for support/resistance wouldn't be possible. I've just moved my pip straddle to 60 pips. I think this is a happy medium between filtering out even more possible shadow trades and the opposite end of entering trades at the end of their run. I think we need to look into a similar SL system just like we've looked for entries after so many pips. What is the likely pip swing on a retrace? We want to filter our the retraces and find more actual movements to the downside. Is a typical retrace 70 pips? Probably not. Is a typical retrace 10 pips? Very possible. So where in between is a good point to not get ourselves involved with typical retraces? Right now since I'm only placing one trade a day for my 5 pips off of GBP/USD I am usually home to hear the alarm as the trade is triggered at night. I'd like to discuss optimum pip straddle amounts for other major currencies as well. My money management strategy needs to capitalize on finding multiple currencies to give me 25 pips a day when only requiring very few pips from each currency. Anyways, I'm not so sure I can believe the percentages on the pdf file posted in the thread. Just quickly looking at a GBP/USD daily chart I've found several instances where the price moved 10 pips in one direction and did not give even 5 pips more. Check out 10/18, 10/11, 10/8. Those are three quick examples just in the last month. I don't have the time to bother checking further, but I expect similar trading can be found all through out the chart. If moving 10 pips was really 95% accurate at predicting the next 10 pips then it can only have 2 more instances on the chart. I found those in just 30 candles. So I have to say the numbers in the pdf aren't true. Anyone disagree? Matt

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Just curious if anyone is using the EA for this and how its working?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Matt, I think it depends on market conditions. The numbers seem to be quite accurate when there's some strong momentum in the market. I doubt that they are true in non-trending markets.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I ran the EA a few times with the default parameters (except changing StartTimes and BaseTimes) on cable 30 min. In all cases, my account was down in the end.

Hi People Sorry haven't been here for a few days... Regarding EA's they seem to be giving some real issues. Its like I was given one the other day which I used to back test and the days were completely different to the results I had whilst actually forward testing. There is something really strange in these EA's but they don't seem to be returning the same reults. Any one have any thought?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Pick a month and place all of your trades on charts with entry and exit price arrows in MT4. Be sure to follow the rules precisely. Save the chart as a template file and send it to your friendly EA creator along with instructions as to which broker you're using (so they can use the same platform). Also, provide a trade log in spreadsheet format. Be sure to have notes column where you can insert notes pointing out discrpancies between your manual backtests and the EA entries/exits. Also, be sure to described the precise settings you're using in the EA. That should help him/her a lot with spotting possible issues with the EA (and/or discovering inconsistencies with the strategy should they exist). Good luck!

Just to update my trades since last Thurs :- Using the London open 8am price and setting the trades +20 and -20 pips away with a TP of 14. Date Trade Triggered @ + Total pips 11/2 1.9055 14 11/3 1.9083 14 11/6 1.8963 14 (sell order triggered) 11/7 1.9060 14 11/8 1.9078 14 11/9 1.9047 21 (my miscalculation with TP sell order) 11/10 1.9100 14 Most days, especially like today far more pips could have been gained but for time constraints and the fact I can't sit in front of the computer all day. Also my spread betting trading platform is very limited in what it will let me do regarding setting partial sell/buys, so to keep everything simple I have just gone for the straddle and TP of 14. This is not ideal if losses occur, as they must, with my SL of 25 a few bad days would cancel out any profits. max

What timezone is this 8:00 am based off of? Trying to match up your numbers to mine. I am using 3:00 AM EST time. I have been playing with this concept in Tradestation (not a MT4 guy at this time). I have most of a strategy in place using this +20/-20 concept, with 14, 30 and 80 as targets. Trying to filter out some of the whipsaw that occurs (am finding some interesting methods at this point). David

--- 帖子 #304 ---
DavidH I'm referring to 8am GMT and I think that is 3am EST, although there are several time zones which I find confusing. For example, is EST (Eastern Standard Time?) the same as Eastern Time? My charts state Eastern Time and being in the UK I always have to recalculate everything. I usually set the trade before I go to work and would need to change brokers in order to catch the longer trades to make the system profitable. Previously I tried using 00.00GMT as the base with +/- 20 pips but found I was getting whipsawed out of trades. Using the London open price is much closer to the pivot of the previous days high/low and (so far) seems to be more successful for me. max

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Don't forget the Frankfurt open price. It's one hour before London opens.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I just want to settle this for everyone that isnt' clear including myself, Is londen open 8amGMT, this is what I think it is, but not sure. Is there a website anyone knows of, that shows correct market open times. THanks

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Have a look here, it might help you: www.worldmarkethours.com FT

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Yes, EST is Eastern Standard Time, also stated as Eastern Time. So, we are looking at the same time. My broker has different open prices (Tradestation) then the ones you listed. One thing I have been noticing is that Frankfurt opens an hour early, this causes early movement somedays. So, as a filter, I have been taking the close as of 1:00 AM EST (one hour before Frankfurt, two hours before London). If the price has moved more than 10 pips, I don't take the trade in that same direction. ie: If the price dropped 15 pips since 1:00 AM EST, then don't take the first sell signal. If the price breaks through the buy signal (20 pips over the London open), then take that trade. This seems to filter out some of the whipsaw. And it also seems to make the buy trade much stronger as it is on the rebound, in the above situation. Am working on making some screen shots with examples. The 14, 30, and 80 targets seem to work out pretty well. Once it breaks the 30, seems to have about a 50/50 shot of breaking 80. Otherwise it overs around the 30 mark. Not too often it drops back to the open (unless there is news involved). I did find that the 25 SL worked out a bit better too, as there would be times the price would just break the Londen Open price and rebound. David

I've paid close attention to this thread and love the idea of mechanical trading. I trust both Micardo and Markj's systems. I am currently using Markj's system, because the higher opportunities for trades better suits my personality. I moved on to write my own journal so I haven't been posting here, but wanted to send a great thanks to Micardo for starting the thread, and for paying attention to mine.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I have a dumb question im sure, If mark or anyone else who knows answer can pls answer for me. Relating to markj system. Im a little confused. Buy or sell +- 20 pips from london open, ok i'll give today as example, london open on pound was 1.9121 bid so if shorting trigger will be 1.9101 now if going long, this is where i get confused, do we long at bid 1.9121 which will be 1.9121 plus spread, so fill price would be 1.9126 in my case as i have a 5 pip spread. or do we long at 1.9116 bid + spread which would be filled at 1.9121 any help understanding this appreciated. thanks stricko

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Today I set my sells at 1.9101 and my buys at 1.9141, right now we are in the short positions, 1st and 2nd targets hit and the 3rd target running howard

--- 帖子 #315 ---
why would your long be the same price as the open? You should add 20 to it also, making the bid 1.9141 (meaning if you have 5 pip spread, the price you place your order at will be 1.9146 because the bid will be here at that time) Yes, congrats guys, you are almost at the +80 as well. I can't wake up (or don't want to yet) to do that strategy.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Sorry People I haven't been able to keep uptodate over the last week... Work has got quite demanding so not to much time to pay attention to the markets, or all of the strategies rather. But Brick911 has been keeping a journal of the systems which is very entertaining. Today we hit all 3 profit targets on Markj's system and both on mine to. Profitability wise I feel markj's is a better syetm but it takes more time to monitor. Regarding the EA we had some issues where the reults of the back test EA did not tally with my actual forward testing results so am not to confident to let an EA do the work. I guess even though mechanical systems do work.... You still need a human to manaully execute or set the orders just for piece of mind. They are looking like good consistent profitable strategies.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
is it the belief of most of the writers in this thread that 00:00gmt entry is best for a 50 pip straddle and 8:00 gmt (open) is best for a 25 or 20 straddle or am i make wrongful assumptions. GREG.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Greg, that is the way I understand it. Not sure if the +50 is better on the London open or not. Pretty sure the +20 is because I tried and tried to make it work using a more convenient time frame for me.. but it won't.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Yup thats correct. If you follow the rules to the letter then the 00gmt is the 50 pip straddle and the London open is the 20 pips straddle. Both have been working well so far but it seems as though if you have more screen time then Markj's strategy is the more profitable one.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
thanks for pointing that out, that was a typo, i really looked like a fool there, so it seems some of you would enter at 1.9146 adding the spread, and some of you will no add the spread when going long, in this case when not adding spread, means that if we have a 5 pip spread, then if it moves 15 pips up we go long, or 20 pips down, i think i'll chose to add spread. thanks guys. i made bank off the pound short , nice to get a win on my first entry using this system.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
according to cable price prediction charts if you play the 25 straddle with 25 pip target (not including spread) with only a 20 SL you have a 77.6% hit rate. what im wondering is how many forward trade samples does one need to hit this percentage 30, 40, maybe 100 i don't know, but i did backtest 22 trade samples and came up with 77.2% (17 wins/ 5 losses ) mmmmm luck? GREG

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Actually I think everybody adds the spread when buying/selling. markj said he ignores spread on one or two of the lots when it comes to targets being met.

Hello, Just wondering what the problems are with the EA. Do any EA's have the same results in backtesting as forward testing? Is it a problem in the coding? I wouldn't think an EA could trade either system any less correctly than a human could considering how the trading field is reset each day with a new candle, the lack of indicators, and the simple math of entering at so many pips. Any results of the forward testing we can see? Thanks. Matt

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Are the issues with the EA being worked on by the developer(s). Have they been provided a manual test trade log showing exactly where the discrepancies lie? Not trying to pry. Am just curious as to the status of the EA. There should be no reason why an EA cannot trade this strategy. There's nothing hocus-pocus (if you will) about EAs. Sometimes simple coding problems can cause errors. Other times, EAs reveal minor flaws in strategies that are easily overlooked. I would love to see work on the EA continue if for any reason it has been halted. Micardo, could you kindly advise on the status and identify who is working on it so that we can provide support and encouragement? Is it the same person who posted info about an EA a few days ago? Thanks! Bill

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Sorry if this has been answered before. With TP of 14, 30 and 80 they're varying levels? I thought I read on one post that the 14 TP is actually 14 minus the spread so you really only make about 9-10 pips depending on your brokers spread, but the 30 and 80 pip levels are still pure profit levels? I don't know. I'm probably just too tired to think right now. Anyone have any data as far as how many times the 80 TP is hit? I might look for an "easy" 50 pips to lock in more consistent returns. So 14, 30 and 50 TP levels. Matt

--- 帖子 #328 ---
If you do a google search for "GridMACD" you will see a link for a domain by the name of lightpatch??, scroll down the page and download the EA. It is basically what this strategy is talking about though it does average in to trades if the trend continues. You can place the "straddle" to whatever you wish to and then it will place additional orders X pips from the entry. But there is a catch w/this particular EA in that it takes some time for it to register the straddle and then initiate trades. Maybe the code can be tweaked in such a way as to do away with the MACD as an entry filter (this is what holds it up from simple beginning the grid/straddle settings), and just have it turn on at London with the 25pip straddle and let'er rip the pips.?? I tested this for two months and found it somewhat profitable on the 15m timeframe but have moved on as the MACD was to unpredictable of an entry filter for what i was seeing price action doing. : ) Thom

Hi 80 pips 3rd target is hit a lot of times, if we change it to 50, with the 1st target being only 14 pips and stop being 3x20 pips, R/R would be very poor; however if 80 pips is not hit we exit on the close of NY session which still may give us your 50 pips Regards howard

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi Micardo, An excellent thread and strategy that you have here, I've been following it for some time now - sort of lurking in the shadows. I have a question for you, if you don't mind. With both of the strategies you discuss trading 3 lots, however how would you recommend trading this if you have an SB account? With the London open straddle it would mean that you wouldn't be moving your stop-loss to b/e until after you had cleared 30 pips and then if the target of 80 pips isn't met, you would be relying on the value at the NY close to be greater than your entry point. Perhaps a more definitive trailing stop could be used with this to lock in profits. Or perhaps there is an optimum get out time - say if the trade is triggered prior to 9.00am GMT then the optimum get out is between 9.30 - 9.45am GMT (just an example - but seems to work ok over the last 4 weeks.) So can I say that for today the London open is at 1.8947 - with the straddle being at 1.8967 and 1.8927. At the moment neither of these have been triggered. The 0.00GMT trade was at 1.8957 ( CMC figures) and with a 50 pip either side straddle this would give entry points at either 1.8907 or 1.9007. Again neither of which have been triggered. However with Kamanda's straddle of 55 pips for a Buy trade and 35 pips for a Sell trade - this would give you 1.8922 and 1.9012. The lower of these, 1.8922 was breached at 6.15am this morning, but the cable has since retraced to give a loss??? Is the stop on this 30 pips or 50 pips? If it's 50 pips then you would still be in the trade, but at 30 pips you would be out.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi JillyB I am sure Micardo will answer your questions in due time; however as far as I am aware we do not trade the "+50,-35" strategy because Kamando applies other strategies alongside of it such as doubling up the position in the opposite direction if the stop is hit which involves high risk. I personally use strategy 2 which is London open, it is simple and it has been working very well. For today the open on my platform has been 1.8946, I am in short trades with both targets 1 and 2 having been hit and stop at b/e. Simplicity is the essence, the more complicated the harder to trade. Regards howard

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Howard, Thanks for your reply. I must admit Kamanda doesn't seem to have given us all of the parameters for his trading system and just looking at it based on +55 or -35 pips, it seems a bit hit and miss. I've been looking at a trailing stop for my trades as I SB and don't trade in lots. A 10MA on a 5 min chart seems to work well - when the price crosses it then you exit the trade. If it stays the right side of it - as it has done this morning - then you let the trade run. And looking at my chart it's just been hit now, so I would have exited the trade at 1.8866 and would have netted 57 pips. I admit that today was only a paper trade as I'm still feeling my way with the system for the moment. But on paper it looks extremely good. The only thing I can't get the hang of is re-entering the trade. Say I've exited the trade now at 11.19 GMT I can't enter on the 12pm candle, so I would be looking to trade from 1pm GMT onwards? Is this right? How would a follow on trade be triggered? Does the price have to come back up to the London open and then breach either the upper or lower trigger levels? Am I understanding this correctly?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Matt, the 1st lot would only give 14 minus spread so you would not get net 14. Markj has been netting 30 and 80 (if it goes to 80) on 2 and 3. However the one time I pointed out it never hit 30 net before retracing, but if you included spread you would've gotten it. That was only 1 time in my watching of it back then, so you take the bad sometimes to get the good? All up to your style. Probably the odds are better if it goes +30, you'll get the spread to the price to net 30. Anyway, wow guys you all have racked up the past few days. Seems like the markj strategy works very well when the cable is trending as the london open determines the trend for the day. I wish I didn't have to work and could get up at 3am(est) just to play this - or be like brick and set my alarm. Micardo - what is your latest strategy? Wait 50, then get 30/80? How is that going?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
If you are referring to Markj's strategy, the re-entering after an hour candle is if the stops are hit. I suppose you would not re-enter until it hits the -20 straddle again, meaning the gbp/usd has to retrace all the way back up to this level, so you wouldn't get back in short again until then. At least that is the way I understand it.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
If the price comes back to the OPEN, you may trade at any time on the opposite side (long here) if it triggers; but if you have been stopped out on the short side whether fully stopped out or partially stopped out, you can trade on the same direction (short here) on the 2nd hourly bar of the stop-out bar, if the short is triggered again. By trigger, I mean cross of +20,-20 lines from the home line. howard

All 3 targets for today's short trades have now been hit. Results of the system for this week: Monday: 15+30+80=125 Tuesday: 15+30+00=45 Wednesday: 15+30+80=125 on one platform -60+15+30+80=65 on another platform note: I use 15 as my 1st target as opposed to 14

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Howard, Congradulations on the results. I have not been watching this system latley as having been putting some documents togther for another stratgey. Try these indicators for visual use. See the Batfink Stratgey thread for use. Do not add the 3rd target indicators and leave time to 2 and Line 1,2 to 20. This will give you a great visual. I am finalising a document for this strategy and some specific rule. All the best. Cheers

Question - Did anybody else not have their orders filled last night? I'm trying to determine if my broker sucks, as none of my orders were filled and I missed out on the entire move. I understand this sometimes happens, but I don't want to be the guy using the worst broker on the block. BTW, I use Interbankgroup. I hate to be a broker complainer, but I need to find one who is going to execute my fills when they are triggered by news events, and Interbankgroup has disappointed a few times in two weeks of use. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Brick, I can't understand how it wouldn't be filled. Even if they widened the spread or whatever. Was it because you had a limit order in and the price "skipped" the limit so it wasn't filled due to slippage?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
On my platform, the order is called an entry stop. I'm guessing the price was skipped through. I understand that with big news events, sometimes a gap is created. But, nobody else seems to have had that problem last night.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Usually the charts show a slippage like that. Looking at the 1 minute chart around 9:30 gmt (when the order should've been filled) it was a whole candle as if the price was hit. Maybe I don't know how to read charts/slippage, but I have definitely seen some major gaps on charts. Maybe that isn't what slippage is though, I dunno. You use ibfx right?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Nah - Interbankgroup... not Interbankfx. I need a broker without a dealing desk maybe. Maybe I'm just a newbie and don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
ahh I see. Oh well. I use forex.com , but they have problems too, but usually not around prices at least not with me.

Markj: Any follow up on this? Has anyone provided funbot with a trade log with which to compare against the EA results? Markj, if you have said trade log, can you post it here? I'd be willing to go through and mark up charts, look at the code and analyze to see if I can spot why there's discrepancies with the EA. Then, I'd provide that input to funbot who hopefully can continue with the project. Thanks Bill

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi funbot: Thanks for providing this initial version of the EA. Can you remain engaged in this project? Is there some specific information we could provide which will help troubleshoot discrepancies between the manual backtests vs the EA backtests? Thanks for your contribution. I'd like to see this project continue and am willing to assist. Bill

Hi there, I have a question: What is the accuracy to hit the TP of 14 Pips vs. a loss of 20 pips? Thanks for your feedback.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I've gotten three out of 5 this week. (14 pips vs. 20 SL) However the three wins also went along with wins for 26 and 50. I have been playing this way... 1 lot for 14, 1 for 26, and one for 50. This week so far I have been stopped twice then the trades were activated in the other direction for complete wins. Monday was 90 pips, Tuesday and Wednesday 30 pips each for 120 for the week. This is a LIVE IBFX account. I'm really hoping that the accuracy increases. I am also toying with the idea of increasing the trigger range to 25 pips rather than 20. If I had played that way, I would have had no losses at all this week. This is a great thread. I've been using a modified Kamanda method also very successfully since early last week.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I find that a 25 trigger at london open is better than the 20, it seem to eliminate premature triggers that can lead to getting stopped out. try it mr. DETROIT

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Thanks for reply mr.Detroit. I think I might change to 25.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I have read this before and is true most of the time unless there is new to change the direction during the day. Like Fomc Meeting!

Hi Micardo, I am finding daily range system, so I am happy when I see your thread Your strategy is nearly the same the first concept of Vegas Wealth Buider, and Vegas suggest Vegas Fibs to filter. Have you ever thought about this, and another indicators to filter ? Someone say that this strategy is outdated, I am wondering is it true? I have just backtest EA by Aha, I can not believe that result is too bad. I am learning MQL4, so I hope I can rewrite this EA in next few days.

Have you just seen the amazing spike because of GBPUSD news? Geeze ... ooch ... Do not trade the "London open method" during a GBP news day or you'll get burnt.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Interestingly enough though, this is the first time in the last 4 weeks (at least - that's all I've quickly checked) that this trade has been stopped out on news. The previous times were all where the Cable just meandered slowly towards the stop. So saying Do Not Trade during a GBP news day would meant you miss out on a lot of trades. A lot of times the trade is triggered by the news anyway. And how do you define news? There is generally 9.30 GBP news most days - it's just that most of it doesn't affect the Cable too greatly.

--- 帖子 #355 ---

I know of a trader that has subscription members. who uses the same method that you people are discussing here. The 0.00 GMT method. Entry prices are a certain piont away from 0.00GMT and stops ect. He uses it with great sucsess, but if there is a loss one day, they double up ( On lots)the next, .. Piont is, there is traders out there using this method on live account with great success

May i ask a stupid question if i have a 5 pip spread on cable and i want to do a 25 pip straddle do i make the lond end of the straddle 30 to get a 25 pip movement and the short 25 pips. IS THAT CORRECT also for a SL of 20 each way do i do it the same way. PT is 25 (not including spread). I would appreciate help from anyone. THANKS Mr. DETROIT

It completely depends on your broker's time. For instance, for IBFX the day ends (and begins) at 7PM EST. ON FXDD it is 5 PM. Other broker's may have different settings.

Well a second day where the Cable exceeded the 20 pip straddle by 1 pip and went on to give us a failed trade. Does anyone have any data on if it has done this many times before? If so do we need to look at increasing the straddle - perhaps 23 pips may be safer?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Placing your straddle orders as oco orders (one cancels the other) would eliminate risking both sides of your straddle. Have any of you tried this? If so, does it help this strategy?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Possibly worth considering is avoiding prices ending in zero to initiate or stop trades. I was taught to always avoid this. Both yesterday and today the open (on my platform, but not necessarily all) ended in a zero.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
@ JillyB better try SL 25 or even 30. This would have worked so far.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
It seems to work best in trending market. 3 days in a row of great trades probably would've had me not trade thurs and fri. Was Thurs and Fri both failed? Also, if you wait 25, would you then only shoot for 10 (or 9) instead of 14 for the 1? Just curious what thoughts are on this.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Looking back over the past 4 weeks of data I have a 22 pip straddle seems to work ok and would eliminate days like today and yesterday where it went through by just 1 pip. As I have an SB account and don't trade in lots, I'm changing the rules slightly to suit me. My first target is 20 pips above/below b/e - however after it has moved 15 above/below b/e then I will move my stop to b/e. This cuts down my losses and makes the stat's better for a SB account. Prior to moving it, my stop-loss is at 17 pips above/below the trigger (giving me a maximum 20 pip loss - 3 pip spread on GBP/USD) If the trade is triggered prior to 9.30am news then I've found the optimum get out time is around 9.35 - 9.45am. If the trade is triggered after 9.30am then look to take only 20 pips. However if it is triggered but the 20 pip target hasn't been hit before 1.30pm news, then look for 40 pip target on the news. No trades to be entered after 3pm. I've also not looked at any reversal trades, only one trade per day triggered from the 8.00am open. Over the past 4 weeks that has given me 3 losing trades and 16 winning trades and 1 breakeven trade. 360 winning pips 60 losing pips Nett pips = 300 Perhaps not as good as trading in lots, but I would still be more than happy if these results continue.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
[quote=JillyB] I've also not looked at any reversal trades , only one trade per day triggered from the 8.00am open. QUOTE] Too bad you didn't do the reversal today huh?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Yes, but it wasn't really a reversal today - just another break of the high which was triggered by the open of the Dow. As I trade the Dow then, to be honest, my attention was elsewhere. This is the appeal of MarkJ's system's, in that it trades primarily in the morning's (UK time) and leaves me with the afternoons free to trade the Dow. On the other hand, yesterdays reversal trade failed - so I was glad I wasn't in that. It's swings and roundabout's I suppose.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Yes, you're right. I've just checked back and two of the three losing trades would have been ok if I'd traded with a 25 pip stop loss (28 pip with spread) that would give me another +40 and a -8 to add on to the one remaining losing trade - which happens to be today. Also 3 of the trades were triggered on news days at 1.30pm - these were 26 October (Durable Goods), 27 October (GDP) and yesterday 16 November (CPI). Whether you would have been able to get the entry you wanted or if there would have been slippage I'm not sure, but there is still room on each of these to take 20 pips. Allowing for these variations it would bring me down to a nett points (after spread and 1 pip tolerance on entry has been taken into account) of 312 pips over the last 4 weeks. I'm still happy with this.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Great. Thanks. I don't recall seeing that posted in this thread. So, it's good to have it here along with the post regarding funbot's EA. Does anyone know if either Aha or funbot are continuing to work on this?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
can someone please help me . if i want to setup a 25 pip straddle let's say from 8800 on cable with a 5 pip spread where would i set the long perhaps at 8830 and the short at 8775 is that correct? will someone please illustrate it for me. MR DETROIT

--- 帖子 #392 ---
you got it. 8830 would be the ask price for the trade (the bid would be 8825 - giving the 25 straddle) The sell is easy because you sell at the bid, so 8775 would be the 25. A friend of mine would remember it like this. 30 straddle for long, 25 for short (even though they both are really 25, it was easier for him to think like this)

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hello all, Anyone have any results, or at least been following along to see if this works? I'm at a new position which requires me to work 6-7 days a week so I haven't had the time. That's exactly why I want to find the solution to this system. A minute of time a day to set up the trades then walk away. Right now I'm analyzing nearly 3 years worth of data in excel to find that magical point of efficiency. I'm an economist so I'm thinking that there should not be multiple exit points. My thinking is that by having multiple exit points we're losing pips even if we hit all of our profit levels. How so? Because if we have hit all of our TP's, then we would have been better off if we had sold all of our investment at the max TP. By creating multiple TP's we are simply creating inefficiency. What we should be looking for is a point that is hit often enough to maximize our profits compared to our SL. Unfortunately the deciding factor in the success of this system is the SL. What SL is large enough to allow winning trades to stay winners while preventing us from losing 200 pips in a trade? I'm essentially asking the same question the systems are based off of. If a price moves 50 pips from the open, what're the chances it'll continue to 100? The problem is that by waiting for 50 pips we have missed much of the move and to get 50 pips would require a lot more movement in the same direction. The chances of it doing so are slim compared to the chances of the price moving only another 5 pips past 50 to 55 pips. Then the SL comes in. Our profit levels are too small to overcome the larger hits on the SL. So what we need to find is an equilibrium point to maximize profit and make it efficient. Where is our straddle? What TP will be hit enough to overcome the loss in SL hits? I'll give several examples. Out of 718 days of data in my chart, 354 are up days. There are a few I threw out because they were doji's and there are a few updays where the actual major move was down. I'm not going to confuse things further right now. I'll post those results later if I ever read through all of it correctly. So say our SL is 30 pips and our TP is only 5 to increase probability of successful trades. My straddle is 60 pips. So the number of instances where price is 60-68 are considered SL hits since my spread is 4 and I need a move of 69 to exit with 5 pip profit. There are 281 trades that would have been made on the up days with 27 of them being bad trades. (Again, many of those probably ended up as good trades on the next days candle, or could have been saved from another method but I'm keeping it simple.) So 254 good trades for a profit of 1270. On the 27 bad trades we'll assume they were worst case scenerio and they each got stopped out at 30 pips. So a loss of 810. Net profit over 281 trades is 460 pips. Now lets change our TP to 10 pips, but keep the 60 pip straddle and 30 SL. So there are still 281 trades. Anything from 60-73 is stopped out. Anything from 74+ pips is a good trade. Out of the 281 trades, 33 would be bad trades while 248 would be good. So 2480 pips in profit with 990 in loss. Total Net Profit is then +1490. Another scenerio, TP of 20 with SL 30 and straddle the same 60. 281 possible trades. Anything from 60-83 pips up is a bad trade stopped out. Anything from 84+ pips is a good trade. Out of 281 trades, 52 bad trades and 229 good trades. So gains would be 4580, losses would be 1560. Total net profit would be 3020 pips. Last scenerio, TP of 90, SL 30, straddle still 60 pips. Need a move of 154 to take profit. Anything from 60-153 is a bad trade. 154+ is a good trade. 83 good trades and 198 bad trades. Gains = 7470. Losses = 5940. Total profit = 1530. So what happened? Why did net profits go down in the last scenerio? We crossed the equilibrium point for that SL level. We started to become less efficient. This is what we need to find. We have the SL level since we set it ourselves. We have the data to show us the probabilities of our TP being hit. All we need to do is input the years of input into excel and see how many days would have been losing trades. I doubt the percentages will fluctuate that much over the years to drastically affect our profits so long as we use many years worth of data. This is all this system ever needs to be to be a successful money maker. One straddle, one TP level, and one SL level. The big problem right now is determining the SL level. Looking at the years of data in excel does not show the swings throughout a day. Unfortunately our results are drastically affected by our SL. We want a SL to allow the winners to stay winners but the big losses prevented. Is 50 SL enough for a daily chart? Maybe only 40 or do we need 70? A system can still be made profitable with a SL of 100 and a lesser TP. What will lead to someone losing money with the system is them forcing too much out of the system. This system can be automated easily, but it may not produce bank breaking numbers. (That's yet to be determined)You have to be willing to accept only a certain amount of profit. The second you stretch more out of it is the second you take it into an inefficient zone. It will correct you automatically though. Thats the beauty of equilibriums. What do you all think? Agree/disagree? If you agree I think the goal right now would be to find the smallest SL that doesn't take away our winning trades. The lower the better! Matt

--- 帖子 #394 ---
By the way, another thought that has been running through my head is spreading this system over several currencies. I don't think that would be wise though. What should be done is to explore other currencies success rates. Say the efficiency of the system on GBP/USD is 2:1 where for every dollar you lose you profit 2. If on EUR/GBP the efficiency is 1.5:1 why would you ever trade the system there? You would always want to trade the 2:1 system. Notice I said dollars and not pips since pips vary in value across currencies. The dollar profit margins would have to be calculated after the research is done and not simply by how many pips would have been won/lost. Economics is so useful! Matt

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I agree 100%. Finding the smallest S/L, so that we can get a maximum T/P is key!

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Matt I only have data back for 130 days, which is about 1/5.5th of what you're detailing here. I have looked at 22 pip straddle with a 23 pip target (20 pips net of spread) and 25 pip stop loss (28 pips including spread). The only other variation I have made is that if the price moves 15 pips or more in your direction, but fails to hit the target and then retraces you would get out at breakeven. This has given (nett of spread) 90 winning trades = 1800 pips 11 break-even 3 days - no trade triggered 26 losing trades = 728 pips Nett pips = 1072 If you times this by 5.52 to roughly extrapalate it to the number of days (718) you've indicated this would give nett points of 5,917 I have to say that the worst time was the middle of June to the end of July, with 14 of the 26 losses occurring during this 7 week period. Does anyone have any thoughts on why this might be?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
permanetjuan.. Great job. I posted the other day what I found, but deleted it because it read and looked like craziness. I'll post again when I get a chance to organize it. 60 straddle - yes perfect. 35s/l is what you need. I looked at data since 3/8/06 on the 15 M timeframe (as far back as metatrader will let me go) I spent a TON of time on this. I am so confident now that I am using this live. Now look at your data. Add days of the week to the data. Do you notice a tp on certain days have a higher success rate? Exclude Monday and Wednesday (never trade those days with 60 straddle - especially wed), that leaves Tue/Thur/Fri to trade, and hint they all 3 have different tp for the highest percent wins. My take is Thur is higher because of Thurs news and expected Fri news. Fri is less than Thur as buying/selling pressure is coming to an end for the week. And Tue is used to make a little bit of extra pips. I won't say my numbers yet. I want to see what you come up with to see if we about match, if you feel like doing that.

llambert3 I enjoyed reading your original post and went back to look for it! I couldn't find it! There was much good information there. Please repost when you can. Didn't look crazy to me. Somebody asked about June and July. They are notorious months for not trending very much. They were great months for Firebird trading. Summer months are generally not big movers.

@ Matt which system do you mean? In this thread at least three different ones are discussed at the same time. The 0.00 GMT method? Or the London open method (8.00 GMT)? Or a third one?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Oops sorry forgot to mention it - thanks for pointing this out. The data I posted in entry 397 relates to the straddle of the London open at 8.00am GMT.

@ JillyB thanks! Now we just need to know Matt's timeframe.

JillyB Are your results based on 1 lot and 1 target? Thanks howard

--- 帖子 #404 ---
HEY jillyB on your post 397 you state you backtested 90 wins and 26 losses my question is are the 26 losses the result of the 25 sl being definitely hit and the 90 wins definitely being hit before being stopped out. MR DETROIT

--- 帖子 #405 ---
PERMANENTJAUN is your backtesting performance the result of a definite stop loss being hit and a definite target being hit. referring to post 394

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi there, Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by this. I manually backtested all the trades and noted the point at where the Buy or Sell trade would have been triggered. After this the Stop Loss is set at 25 pips above/below the entry price and the target exit price is also set. If the target price is met without the s/l being triggered - it's a winning trade. If the s/l is triggered without it going near the target price - it's a losing trade. The only variation to this is, that once the price moves 15 pips in your direction the the s/l is moved to break-even. I hope this gives you the answer you want. Jilly

--- 帖子 #407 ---
jillyB sorry i was not clear on my question but you were very clear on the answer. it just seems that sometimes these backtesting results are based on other variables other that SL and TP scenarios. MR DETROIT

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Howdy llambert, GFT doesn't show what day of the week a date is. So I had to manually look on my computer calender. Our success rates depend on our TP levels. I only gave examples in my previous post to show that we shouldn't be looking for multiple TP levels. There is an efficient point out there which I haven't found yet. So I can't say exactly what the success rates where considering I haven't given a TP level yet. For sake of argument we'll assume I entered trades on up days with a 60 pip straddle and was only looking for a 5 pip profit. (This kept the losing days to a minimum so I could quickly see what days of the week they were.) I may have counted wrong in my first post, but I only see 26 bad trades now. Meaning the up movement hit 60-68 which would not have allowed me to exit with a 5 pip profit. Here is the breakdown of what days of the week those losing days were. Sunday - 8 Monday - 5 Tuesday - 3 Wednesday - 5 Thursday - 5 Friday - 0 I will now note that my data is formed from candles that open at 5 PM Pacific Time. I'm in Arizona. I think this means my candles form at 00:00 GMT. Correct? Unfortunately the data set is small. Except for Friday and Sunday trades I think the numbers are pretty evenly averaged out. Meaning, it would not be worth while to count out certain days over others since they play relatively the same. I believe if a larger data set it used then friday and sunday will average out the same as well. The only way to play each day differently is to look at the probabilities from those days discreetly. For example, see how many Tuesdays had the greater movement up. How far up did it move up from the open? How far did it move down from the open? How does this compare to the typical Wednesday movement? There are more questions to break it down, but I'm not going to complicate things right now. I don't have the capabilities to look at any weekday specifically so I can not create a system for different days. You seem to be able to and I see nothing wrong in doing so. You'd essentially be creating 5 different variations of the same system. Something we should consider though is trader psychology. In the quick data I have looked at there was not one single up day that stalled at 61 pips up. It went from 5 days stalling at 60+ then only a few days at 62+, 63+ and then several at 65+. I think I can safely say this is because of traders using even numbers to make their trades. So I think we should alter our straddle accordingly to our TP. We could have saved 5 trades from stalling on us if we had simply entered at 1 pip more, or 61+ from open. Oddly enough, there was only one day that stalled at 70+ and then no days at 71+ or 72+. Then there is one day at 73+ and several days at 75+. We should find a level that has few days of stalling on it, but also compliments our TP such that we're allowing enough opportunities to reach our TP. We can't put a straddle of 100 and expect to TP of 80 many times. Right now I think a 61 pip straddle could be best since it will filter out being on the wrong side of the candle much of the time and still allows a candle to move many pips on an average day. If we have a 30 TP it is not unreasonable to expect it to get hit frequently; even a 40 may not be unheard of. I'm starting to wonder if we should use only 2006 data to come up with our probabilities though. Did GBP/USD trade in 2004 like it trades now?

62a94 - I do not have an EA capable platform so I am doing manual backtesting through excel. Therefore I can't tell you if the SL would have been hit before becoming a winning trade. My results are based on if the up move would have eventually allowed to exit with the TP. If it didn't then I made the trade an automatic worst case scenerio with a total SL hit. I think the results will still hold for the following reason. There would have been trades that I counted as being stopped out but, if allowed to continue trading into the next days candle, would have closed in profit. So I believe the results would have averaged out in the end anyways. My point of post 394 however was to debate the use of the multiple TP levels. I think it is inefficient. I was using the scenerios to give examples of how we can find the true efficient level of profit maximization. The SL plays a huge part in this and we should focus on that right now. I think the 61 pip straddle is a good point. Now we need to find a SL that allows our plays to move and close in profits while still protecting us from ultimate system failure. Would a simple trailing stop work best? I base this on the idea that a price will only retrace a certain amount. Can we expect a price to rise 60 then retrace 70 before running 100 pips to close 40 above the intial 60 rise? That would be an EXTREME day of trading. The system isn't looking for extreme cases though. We're looking for the typical trade days to maximize profits through consistency. So maybe a 70 SL is too large and excessive. A 10 SL is too close, 70 too far, maybe 40? We should probably look into making our SL something like 41 as well to make it an awkward number unlikely to get stopped out on. Matt

I should note that my numbers will obviously be different among us all since our brokers have different data for each day. I think the concepts will still hold true though.

ok, you went about it differently than me I suppose. I liked Mircardo's 50 straddle, so I went backtesting. At first, just September -15m to get accurate s/l data. I noticed far too often it hit his 50 then reversed. I kept increasing it until I came to the solution of 60. What I have is a spreadsheet for each day. Beside the date I put levels of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 up to 70. If after the 60 straddle hit it went up say 40 pips, I subtraced my 5 spread and said that day produced 35 pips. I then put the number in each column (ie 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35) If after it went up 40, it reversed and fell drastically to hit the s/l, I put the s/l (in my case -$40) in the other columns up to the 70 columns. If the trade stalled and the day closed (either positive or negative) I closed the trade at whatever the open of the new day was and the result was put in the other columns up to the 70 column. So after September I decided to go back from March to now. A friend of mine was reviewing the data with me. He suggested looking at the days of week, and even if one Thursday failed, the chances of the next Thursday failing. He gave me the ideas, I did the work.. LOL At first I did percentages based on whether the trade was positive or negative (regardless of whether it hit the number for that column - meaning if for column 35 pip, the trade closed at end of day with only +12, I counted it as a winner). Then we broke it down to whether the actual pp was met for a percentage. Finally, we broke each set of data out for the days of the week. I had Monday - Friday broken out into sections. I looked at these percentages and it was amazing. Wednesday alone from 3/8/06 to today for 5 pips up to 70 would all be a net negative number. So why trade Wednesdays? I choose to ignore Wednesday. Monday was positve across the board, but barely, like less than 100 pips since March, so it too was useless to me. As far as your other questions. Yes, your 5 pm is my 8 pm which is start of new day. I also did as you regarding straddle. I found 87 straddle weeded out a ton of problem days for 15 pips profit. You had to wait sometimes 3 days to 6 days to get in. I wanted something to trade more on. Also the day I tried it, it failed on 3 lots YIKES so I thought crap that didn't work. Finally, finally, you are right about us using 2006 data. My friend on the percentage thing is worried because we don't have Nov-Feb data. He wants to use the Month idea too.

JILLYB can you tell me on your backtesting results how many consecutive losing trades you had in a row and how many winning? MR. DETROIT

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Most wins in a row = 14 Most losses in a row = 3 (this was during the 7 week period from middle of June to end of July when there were 14 losing trades in a total of 35 trades) Since then the most losses in a row have been 2.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
JILLYB the reason im asking is i am using a similar straddle of a 25 trigger 20 TP and a 20 SL and i have had 3 losers in a row from thursday of last week to today. if your forward testing or live trading please tell me what was you results over the same 3 days. the day are nov 16th, 17th and 20th. maybe im doing something wrong. please responed.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Just a thought, but you haven't related the any of the main winning days to news days have you? NFP, CPI GDP etc? I was wondering if on these days you were more/or less likely to have winning trades. Also what about days when there are no news releases, do they have any effect on the win ratio?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Welcome Natel! There are some very good discussions in FF and this thread is one of the best IMHO. A not too complicated system. Nice &amp; friendly here so if you have any questions just ask.... Good luck..... Angie

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Actually that is our next project. One reason I'd like a downloadable calendar from ff. I started the news project only mentioning USD news. My friend said what about GBP news? I never even thought about it. For NFP April = won May = won June = won July = won August = won September = lost October = double trade (1 lost, 1 won) netting 0 for the day November = won On the losses, if you went for 20 pips you would've won all times. Other thing if we WIN one way, we cancel other straddle order. If we LOSE one way, we leave the other order. Cancelled ALL pending orders (no trades had opened) by 17:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi JillyB, A newbie here and this is my first post. I am very interest in your way of trading. Especially the Winning Ratio of &gt; 78% on the backtesting, I am very excited.. Regards to your trading method, do you know if there is EA that follows your strategy. I know Aha made an EA for Micardo but it doesn't consider the Trailing Stop after the 15 PIP movement. Or can somebody modify the Aha's EA so that you don't have to manually backtest. Thanks. AL

--- 帖子 #419 ---
16th November = 20 pip profit 17th November = 28 pip loss 20th November = b/e (15 pips in my direction was hit before it started to retrace, therefore I exited the trade at b/e)

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi Al I believe an EA is to do with MetaTrader, however I'm not sure what it is and as I don't use MetaTrader I can't really help you. Sorry

--- 帖子 #421 ---
d jillyB are you saying you made this with the 22 pip straddle and 23 pip tp and 25 sl? i lost all days did you win today i lost

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Did anyone make profit off the 20 or 25 straddle at the open today?? MR DETROIT

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Yes, today was another 28 pip loss.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
maybe if you look at it and see a 25 pip straddle would've been near the 1.9000 mark (on my chart exactly that) you would not put in the trade. Seems like these type of numbers are hard to overcome sometimes. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
JILLY i stopped out with a 20sl and a 25 trigger was that why my trade failed jilly can you do me a big favor can you give me the way you setup your trade today with you spread included i'm assumimg you set your trade up at london open which was 1.8976 give me The actual numbers you imputed, i know this is a lot to ask you so i greatly appreciate this. also you said you had a profit of 28 pip but in your earlier post you said the tp was 20 were does the other 8 come from. second target perhaps thanks MR DETROIT

Sorry Jillyb I Misread Your Post

Hi permanentjaun, I really enjoyed your posts, so I'd like to share some ideas I found out after about 3 years of research and backtesting of different systems. I think efficiency is not the main goal of a system. In my oppinion consistency is the main goal and in fact I think consistency is the holly grail. If your system makes pips very consistently, it doesn't matter how many pips, you can leverage and compound that into milions of $$$$ in a couple of years. For me it's very easy to find out what are the optimal parameters for your straddle system. I can find optimal Timing, optimal SL, optimal TP using my homegrown optimization algorithms. But what happens is that we curve fit your system to the history, which I can guarantee it will not repeat in the future in the same way. However by using multiple lots with different SL and TP, it will not make most pips (wont be most efficient), but it will be more STABLE . So it will be less curve fitted to the past and will have more potential to be more consistent in the future. Could you please share your excel backtested results with us? Robert {link removed, see rule 3}

--- 帖子 #428 ---
does anyone agree with me when i say that cable has developed an upward consolidation that is limiting it's daily range therefor whipshawing smaller stradlles out such as 20 or 25. or am i just CRAZY, which one is it?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Robert this is a great post. My studies over the past several years would agree. Consistant pips rather than large number of pips is the key. I too feel that we start to curve fit over past data, which will never be repeated the same way in the future. Currently I am using small lots on straddles with multiple take profit points. So far, this seems to be very promising.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I'm going to have to disagree with you. If you want consistency then we would look for a system that only gets 1 or 2 pips a day. Yes we could use the power of compounding to make those 1 or 2 pips worth a lot of money. The problem is even 1 or 2 pips isn't 100% guaranteed. Say the system is a remarkable 98% successful for 1 pip. The 2% of the losing times our order is stopped out for a 30 pip loss. So for every 100 trades we have 98+ gain with 60 loss. Total profit is only 38 pips. Now alter the system to a 2 TP and 30 SL. The system is only 95% accurate now. (Still a very high success rate) Out of 100 trades we would have 180+ gain and still 60 loss. Net profit is 120 pips. The first scenerio is more consistent than the second, but the second is more efficient. By keeping the SL the same and doubling our TP we have effectively increased our expected profits by 300%. This is why I don't think using multiple TP levels really helps us. There is a point which correlates with the SL we select that will give us a maximum expected payout. To further the above scenerios I will show you the equilibrium point for similar situations. Say we have a SL of 30. We have TP levels of 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80, and 90. For each TP level we have varying success rates as follows. 10 TP is 90%, 20 TP is 80%, 30 TP is 70%, 40 TP is 60%, 50 TP is 50%, 60 TP is 40%, 70 TP is 30%, 80 TP is 20%, and 90 TP is 10%. The expected payouts out of 100 trades would be: 10 TP = 900 pips gain - 300 loss = +600 pips 20 TP = 1600 pips gain - 600 loss = +1000 pips 30 TP = 2100 pips gain - 900 loss = +1200 pips 40 TP = 2400 pips gain - 1200 loss = +1200 pips 50 TP = 2500 pips gain - 1500 loss = +1000 pips 60 TP = 2400 pips gain - 1800 loss = +600 pips 70 TP = 2100 pips gain - 2100 loss = 0 pips 80 TP = 1600 pips gain - 2400 loss = -600 pips 90 TP = 900 pips gain - 2700 loss = -1800 pips It's simple economics. So the optimal TP level for a 30 SL given the success rates given is either 30 or 40. Making a quick calculation shows 35 TP, given an assumed 65% success rate gives us +1225 pips. Efficiency means just as much about consistency as it does maximizing profit. A 10 TP may be consistent but it sure isnt the best profit level. I'm suggesting that instead of having multiple TP levels to average it out, we look for that optimum TP level. That way we aren't losing pips when we look for only 5 TP or the more rare 80 TP. There is an equilibrium point that will maximize profits somewhere and it's not at multiple points. We may not find the true equilibrium point, but we can come close such that people will have similar success. Such as if they used a 30 or 40 TP as illustrated above. Expected payouts would still be very close. The first step we need is to find out a small enough SL that won't turn winners into losers, then we go from there. I'm hoping it's no more than 40. Unfortunately I don't have any conclusive data to show you from my excel backtesting more than what I've already shared. I think a 61 straddle will work well with filtering out bad trades. I'm looking for opinions on a SL and then I can find the optimum TP for a 61 straddle by coming up with success rates for different TP levels from historical data. How do you all think I should go about looking at the data. Only use 1 years worth of data or all of it? There are several periods of time when gbp/usd traded very differently than it does now. Take a look at March 2002 to June 2002. A year before that involved many large pip days, but overall movement over several months stayed relatively flat. If we're to build the success rates for this system I think we should either use only 1 years worth of data or at least 10 years. If we look at 2-3 years then odd trading years will affect the results dramatically. By using 10 years or more we can expect that GBP/USD would have traded similar to it does now, or will in the future, and therefore the SL, TP, and success rates we find will be able to stand the test of time. Matt

GoodThings Posted some interesting stats for Cable that may help determine some of this: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...8&amp;page=2&amp;pp=15

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Very interesting. Thanks for the link. I'll be looking that over much more closely in a little bit. Something that has been running through my head though. The strategy we're talking about would work best in situations where candles have no shadows whatsoever or at least small shadows on the counter trend side of the candle. So I've been thinking, could our success rate be increased if we altered it to a weekly chart? A quick glance shows the length of shadows on a weekly chart compared to the bodies is smaller than the shadows vs shadows on a daily chart. It might produce a higher success rate which also allows for higher TP levels, even 100 or 200 per trade. Obviously it'd only be 1 trade per week. Who knows? Just something else to consider. Perhaps if not a weekly gbp/usd chart then look for another currency to play on a daily/weekly chart that has small shadows compared to their candle bodies. Matt

Today was another losing trade for the 22 pip straddle of the London open. It broke the straddle at the top and then got whipped out on the BoE Minutes news at 9.30am. That's 3 losing trades and 1 break-even trade in the last 4 trades. So I got to thinking that perhaps it has something to do with it being the holiday week and perhaps it's best to stay out during the days around a major holiday. This then made me look at the 4th July and I noted that I'd recorded this as a losing trade, when in fact it wouldn't have been a trading day due to it being a US holiday. In fact I'd also included Columbus Day and Labor Day in the results - Columbus Day was another losing trade and Labor Day was a no trade day. So not including these days would affect the results I've posted for the better. Also, going back to the 4th July, it interested me to note that the 5th &amp; 6th July were also losing trades (the 3rd was a winning trade). Perhaps there is something to be said for not trading this method around major holidays as the volume is light and therefore the movement is erratic. I take it that the other days - Columbus and Labor Day - are considered major US holidays when the markets are closed? I checked on the web and they're listed there as holidays, but I need to check that the markets are generally closed on these days. Is Memorial Day - May 29th - also a day when the US markets are closed? Interestingly the system shows a win for this day - which is why I'm asking the question. Interestingly UK bank holidays don't appear to have any effect on how the performance so eliminating them would be irrelevant.

JB, thaks for the info...

--- 帖子 #435 ---
It is a little wierd in that the stock market is closed Easter, but we have to work (I work for a bank). I know Labor Day and Memorial Day the markets are closed. The section I work in at the bank takes day after Thanksgiving instead of Columbus day. The other part of bank is closed so I think the markets are closed too. As far as being a major holiday, I would say Columbus Day is not. You can bet Memorial and Labor Day are though. Memorial is in our minds the beginning of summer and Labor Day the end. Everybody here does some big plans for those.

i thiunk thread is right io have noticed the same thing on the 15 monute chart for about two months now and it has only disobeyed this movement ones. i think some thing has to cause this bought i can't explain it fundamentally or technically.

A great day for the Micardo method. After an early week of No Trades, today was +30 and +80 pips. Thanks Micardo!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Interesting... So of course trigger, TP and SL all adjusted. On 1st glance, 150-200 pip trigger, SL and TP seems about right.

Hi there I anticipated possible whipsaw on 9.30am news today so set up s/l at 50 pips and survived to end trade 80 pips in profit. Over last month I have demoed my spread bet account with 23 pip straddle, and did not trade US mid term elections and 3 other big news days. I made 1 losing trade, rest were winners. I use s/l of 40 pips. Not sure what results would be if I had traded the past month live as maybe slippage would have a large impact? This is reason I am selective which big news days I trade (red impact on FF calender). Be interested to learn what s/l levels others on this thread are testing? Cheers Angie

Hello everyone,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; As I said I'm doing all of my backtesting in excel since my broker does not have EA capabilities. I think I prefer it this way anyways so I can actually see all of the numbers. The problem with this is that in analyzing all the numbers it becomes very cumbersome to play with them. Looking at 700 days of numbers can be confusing looking at all the possible scenerios they create. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; So I thought I'd simplify things for a couple minutes. I mentioned in a previous post that for this strategy the perfect candle is one where the counter trend shadow is 0 and the body is long with a close at the high. I've been looking at other charts for GBP/USD and noticed that switching to a weekly chart gets rid of a lot of the counter trend shadows or at least makes them much more proportionally small compared to the bodies than on a daily chart. I decided to look at the data in excel.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I saw some pretty interesting things. I think I was fairly correct in my observation that the counter trend shadows on weekly candles are much smaller in proportion than on daily candles. You would think a longer time frame would allow for more movement and therefore longer shadows. This isn't so much the case though. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Here are the pip movements for UP weeks. The numbers on the left, high-open, show the pip movement in the real body of the candle. The values on the right are the counter trend shadows for their corresponding weeks.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;TABLE class=MsoNormalTable style="WIDTH: 151pt; BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse;

Lets use a 61 straddle with a 100 SL. Where should our TP be? The following scenerios are on up weeks. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Let's try a 150 TP. We need 215 pip movement. This happened 19 times for a gain of 2850. Assuming worst case scenerio we would have lost 11 times for a loss of 1100. In those same candles it would have triggered 12 trades on the counter side for a loss of 1200. So only 550 pip profit. Very inefficient.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Let's try a 50 TP. So 61 straddle requires a 54+61 = 115 pip move. On the UP weeks we would have hit that target EVERY SINGLE TIME. The gain would be 1500. BUT, there would have been trades triggered on the opposite side since our trigger is small. There would have been 12 trades triggered where 3 would have hit our TP and 9 losing. So 1500+150-900. 750 pip profit. Better than the first scenerio. You're averaging about 125 pips a month at that rate since these stats are only half a year or so. (The other half of the year are down weeks)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I have a theory that a better equilibrium point will be where some of the trades in the correct direction do not close for profit. By allowing one or two of those to not close in profit we may gain by allowing many fewer counter trend trades to happen. Meaning we will sacrifice 2 of our winning trades to prevent making 4 losing trades. Let's try a 92 straddle with 50 TP. Still a 100 SL. We need 145 pips to close in TP.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 28 trades on the good side of the trend. 1400 pips. 2 not closing so -200. 4 trades triggered on the counter trend side. 2 hit TP and 2 do not. So total profits will be 1400+100-200-200 = 1100 pips. Averaging about 183 pips a month at that rate. Decent right?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Looking at down weeks using the last scenario data of 92 straddle, 50 TP, and 100 SL we get the following results. 22 trades occurring on the main trend side. 19 would close for profit and 3 a loss. 650 profit. 4 trades triggered on the down side, all lose. Net gain is 250 pips. Over all the weeks then our total pip gain is 1350 or about 112 a month. Those numbers aren’t so impressive. This means that we probably shouldn’t use the same straddle and TP for down weeks. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I don’t want to further this post any more since it is about to get even more confusing with numbers and scenerios. Once I change the straddle and TP for up vs down situations then it also changes the previous results. I’ll try and clean things up later. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I’m also going to test the possibility of a trailing stop loss. Is a 100 trailing stop loss large enough to prevent our week long trades from being stopped out? I’ve already shown that it’s possible to make nearly 200 pips a month using a simple 100 SL. If the large 100 trailing stop loss doesn’t stop out any winning trades, but saves the losers from being complete 100 pip losses to perhaps only 50-80 then it will greatly affect our profit margins. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I’m starting to wonder how much more one could make by using the same strategies for shorter time frames. Is it worth it? If I can find a way to have expected profits of 150-200 pips a month would it be worth it to be in front of the computer to trade the strategy on a daily or intraday timeframe? What if trading it on a daily chart only nets another 50 pips a month? Maybe if we can get an EA to successfully carry out the trades it might be. Right now I may be leaning towards the weekly chart though. 30-50 avg pips a week is enough for me. Power of compounding will make it very worth while. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I haven’t checked yet, but I’m hoping 100 SL on a weekly chart is enough. Considering the small counter trend shadows on the weekly charts I have to assume that price rarely rises 92 pips then reverses over 100 pips to form the shadow before rocketing 200-400 pips in the original direction to form the body. It’s not impossible mathematically, but if either side had that much control over the price then they wouldn’t allow for the 100 pip reverse. Understand? Anyways, would like to hear everyones thoughts. Where do you all stand on this? Thanks. Matt

Hi Angie, Do you mind sharing with us little bit more about what you are doing. For example, what is your TP strategy, one or multiple lot, and reverse entry, etc.. Thanks in advance. Al

Hello all, Quickly, I mentioned in a previous post about the idea of using this strategy on multiple pairs. I said that it would not be wise because if the system is 90% accurate on one pair and 75% accurate on another, you should focus all your effort on the 90% accurate pair. By trading the 75% pair you're reducing your profit margins. I believe that to be true. But, would it produce more profit to trade each pair since it will produce more trades or would putting more into each play of the 90% pair work better? Thoughts anyone? Matt

Having studied Risk Management in good depth at a graduate level, it would very much depend on the correlation Coefficient of the two systems, if it improves the RISK adjusted returns then it would be worth trading both pairs. Remember it would be worth trading it on less correlated pairs as these would more likely give u a lower correlation of teh two systems. Here is a site (see below) which provides the correlation of differnt pairs over different time horizons. I have various system, some for futures others for Spot FX. For the FX systems i intentially trade the systems over the least correlated pairs, i.e my divergence and hidden divergence system i only trade on GBP, CAD, AUD and NZD (note not the EUR and CHF, highly correlated with the GBP). The system does not work so well on USDJPY, GBPJPY and EURJPY, otherwise i might also trade it on these. http://www.dailyfx.com/story/chartin...eyword=article

Carlos, Great post although you'll probably have to edit it out soon. Some thoughts though. If we find a system that works well with a currency, such as GBP/USD, then wouldn't we want to find currencies that actually trade very similar to it? I say this because if we can find a currency that is equally as successful on GBP/USD then we would want to use it in the hopes that when one currency hasn't triggered a trade yet, the other currency, moving in a similar but altered manner, will have triggered a trade. My thought process is that we never want more than one trade to be happening at one time. If we have two trades occuring at once we should always have the desire to have all of the funds trading in the more successful system. Why put money into a 50% successful currency when you can trade one that is 85% successful. Considering equal pip values and such, the 85% successful currency will always produce greater profit in the long run. That is why we might want to look for highly correlated pairs in the hopes that they trigger equally sucessful, but at different times so that we can always have money playing the success rates. If we have a 90% successful pair it is nice, but if it only triggers 1 trade a month for 10 pips then it's not as profitable as the 70% successful system that triggers 10 trades a month. Matt

Great Post Permanentjaun! Maybe I am missing something here but how would you know if the week is down or up before you place your weekly trades?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hey pipbird, I assume you're referring to one of my previous posts about using different straddles for up and down weeks. You wouldn't know. All I'm saying is we may have to use different straddles for long and short trades. I haven't found a good level for the short trades yet. For long I think a +95 straddle with 50 TP and 100 SL works pretty well. I have to look at longer time frames though. Looking at several years of data wouldn't be unheard of. My weekly chart goes all the way back to 1987. That may be a little excessive use of data. Short trades may even be a higher straddle such as 120 with a lower TP. I haven't found the happy medium yet. I got a little side tracked with things. I worry that by using a different straddle that our expected profits will go down. The data I used of one year consisted mainly of up weeks. So what happens when things reverse the next year produces more down weeks? Should I keep the 95 straddle for short trades as well in anticipation of a down year? Using a higher straddle may even prevent more losing trades on up weeks. I'll let you know what I find. Anyone else have any findings or am I the only one doing excel back testing? Whats everyones concensus on a 100 SL? Large enough for a weekly chart? Matt

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I've given you my ideas already. I am creating a vb program that takes the 15m data so I can do more with it. I haven't learned (MQL is it?) Metatrader language. At least in vb I can do whatever I want. Has anybody here been using ibfx in Metatrader since 2005? I can get the 15m data from March 8, 2006 to now, but not before. I wrote ibfx and they said they didn't offer the data. Said to ask somebody who may have it on their system already.

Check Alpari databank (just google that). They offer free data going back to 2004 I believe. andersenws

Kamanda uses 55L and 35S for his trigger on the daily's for Cable with reported excellent results. His SL I believe is 75 and 55 respectively. Perhaps a similar ratio on the weekly's would help the short side. I think your 61 is very close on the long side for daily's and 91 looks good on the weekly long trigger. Maybe a 53 pip trigger would yield better results on the weekly shorts.

Hi Al Sorry for delay in getting back to you - manic at work and could not check thread.... I am using a very simple method. Straddle 23 pips on London open, SL 40 pips, TP 20 pips. I lot traded. No indicators, but I do like to check what the trend is. 2 days the trade closed in the very early hours of the following day. I place trade most days, but where there are several important news report releases for the day affecting GBP/USD pair I do not place trade. This is rather a crude strategy at the moment. Tested only over the last month. Needs refinement for money management perhaps. Open to suggestions for improvements or anything I may have overlooked. Regards Angie

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi Al, Yesterday, I had the day off work, so was able to adjust my tp and sl throughout the day to gain 80 pips on the trade - a first for me, as I have been just setting and forgetting my trades each day. Today, my trade did not hit my tp, so closed manually this evening at break-even. The other two times when my tp was not hit the day of the trade reached tp in the very early hours of the next day. Hope this helps.... Angie

Hi Matt, If Merlin checks he will notice its a link from an FXCM site, i assure u i wouldn't recommend anyone to trade with them... just my view!! Great post although you'll probably have to edit it out soon. Some thoughts though. If we find a system that works well with a currency, such as GBP/USD, then wouldn't we want to find currencies that actually trade very similar to it? I say this because if we can find a currency that is equally as successful on GBP/USD then we would want to use it in the hopes that when one currency hasn't triggered a trade yet, the other currency, moving in a similar but altered manner, will have triggered a trade. uumm, i understand what your saying, but i don't think this is an ideal situation. The more diversification u can add to your trading the better, PERIOD. There are two types of risk, systematic risk and unsystematic risk. Market traders are never rewarded for systematic risk (i.e risk that can be diversified out of the portfolio by diversification of systems, markets and time frames) Please this is a very very important topic. Having institutional experience (now trying to biuld my own business) i can assure u that an employer would hammer u if u didn't respect this!! What if the system was triggered on both currecnies at the same time, this might happen more frequently than u might expect. In this situation your risk would be doubled up, even trippled! Also to cancel orders u would need to be constantly around your computer to know when one of your entry orders has been triggered. My thought process is that we never want more than one trade to be happening at one time. If we have two trades occuring at once we should always have the desire to have all of the funds trading in the more successful system. Why put money into a 50% successful currency when you can trade one that is 85% successful. Considering equal pip values and such, the 85% successful currency will always produce greater profit in the long run. U can have more than one trade open at any one time if the markets are not overly correlated, yes there is intermarket analysis where all markets are linked with one another, hence why u might never have more than 3 or 4 positions open at any one time, but it is ok to have more than one trade open. Here u also talk about just trading one system, here i also say, systematic risk. All system, even 85% accurate will go through periods of drawdown (a statistical fact), also 85% accurate systems are very hard to find, my systems are based around Risk to Reward rather than % accurate That is why we might want to look for highly correlated pairs in the hopes that they trigger equally sucessful, but at different times so that we can always have money playing the success rates. If we have a 90% successful pair it is nice, but if it only triggers 1 trade a month for 10 pips then it's not as profitable as the 70% successful system that triggers 10 trades a month. Matt[/quote] Why not find uncorrelated pairs which trigger at diff times, catch different moves and therefore give u a smoother equity curve while having a high success rate. The best systems (as a rule of thumb) work on different timeframes and markets, it is a good test of the validity of a system. Of course small adjustments need to be made for the different market behaviours, but they should be done in an intelligent manner, with logical reasoning, rather than curve fitting. However; i do have a fantastic system which only really works on one currecny (GBPUSD) and only on the 15 min chart. I recommend two books: 1) Designing testing and Optimization of trading Systems, Robert Pardo, Wiley Traders Advantage. 2) This book is on the practical application of Excel spread sheet modeling, includes many advanced risk management tools. Will be heavy reading if your new to this stuff. Financial Modeling, Benningo, MIT Press Good luck, i'm away till Tuesday on a stag weekend in Prague!!

Hopefully I'll catch you before you leave. You'll have to explain in a little more detail with me. I think a more detailed definition of systemic and unsystemic risk is needed. You said that by playing correlated currencies with the same success rates is essentially doubling or even tripling the risk. The reward would also be doubled or tripled and therefore the risk/reward stays the same. Which is why I ask, why even bother trade more than one currency if you found the most successful one? This is, of course, assuming that it gives you enough trades. Why advocate the trading of a less successful system, assuming that the different systems trigger the same number of trades? How is trading uncorrelated pairs unsystemic risk? By playing a currency with less success then you're introducing more risk into the system. I'll need a little help to understand more what you're talking about. Thanks in advance. Matt P.S. - Happy thanksgiving all.

Traderone, Can you share the details of your modifed Kamanda version. Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Yes. I've had a good time over the last couple of weeks trading a kind of modified Kamanda system. You can find his posts earlier in this thread. I have been placing straddle trades at 5 PM EST on the GBPUSD daily open. For long trades I require a travel of 54 pips. For short trades I now use 40. Stops were at the beginning 50 for longs and 35 for shorts. I have changed to 54 for longs and 40 for shorts. I use two lots per trade. One is set for a TP of 25 and the other for 50. Usually by around 10 AM EST I close out the second trade if not already stopped by SL or TP. I call the small trade T1 and the larger trade T2 on the enclosed spreadsheet. Started on Nov 7 and ended on Nov22. I didn't trade Friday because I still feel on Holiday! So far I like this method and it hasn't required a lot of nervous screen time. I call it Karamba just for my own amusement. Enjoy. (282 pips so far).

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Traderone, thanks for all the details. I have been studing the kamanda replies and your reply and results. I still have a few questions. As discussed in earlier replies it is clear that not every system has he same close (how strange that is). Can you please help me with the following: - First of all which broker do you use for your straddle/OCO orders - Do you start from previous close + 55 for long and previous close - 35 for short or do you start at other starting points is it 54 and 40. Since I can not get the same close price (I'm looking at metatrader) it is difficult to analyze from your attached zip file. - Then I see stops at 50 for long and 40 for short is this correct. - What happened on the 17th. can you have a long and short with a straddle ?? Thank you very much for your help. Eric

Hello all, I just had a quick revelation for finding equilibriums. I've been looking at things quite awkwardly when it's all pretty simple actually. We can't force the market to do anything. So why should we force our TP's and triggers? We should look at the data to see where the most pips are available. It is so easy. http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5532/graph1pn0.png I've been looking at charts like this all day for the past couple of days. This is a chart from a weekly chart. It is for the down weeks in the last 52 weeks. The x-axis shows the frequency of the pip movements. The y-axis shows just how many pips the price moved. In this case it is for the down weeks, so the y-axis numbers are how many pips down from the open the price moved. I've been trying to find a way to determine trigger points and TP levels. My initial reaction was to look at the curve of the overall slope and find where it changes dramatically showing points where pip movements became more radical. It's not so apparent on this chart since it's a very small data set. If you saw a chart with 1000 candles of data then you'd easily see what I'm talking about. It begins to curve up exponentially as you approach the y-axis from the right. Anyways, it was actually looking at small data sets like that which made the simple easy to see. All we need to do is find the bar on the above chart that has the most area. For example, bar 8 would be (8)(.0253), the red lines, and bar 22 would be (22)(.0111), the yellow lines. Therefore the areas would be .2024 and .2442 respectively. Logic would then kick in and tell us more pips are possible if we play a system that only plays for the 111 pip, .0111, movement on a down move. On the above chart the point with maximum possible pips would be playing a system that exits after -181 pips movement from open. This is because it would have happened 17 out of the 22 times allowing for a system to play with 3077 possible pips to maximize profit in a little less than half a year. From there we just have to find the efficient point that maximizes profit with a given SL. I just had to get this down just so I don't have a brain fart and lose it even though it's such a simple concept. Instead of stabbing in the dark with numbers we at least have a starting point. We know that the most possible pips in a down movement are when we look to be out of the trade when it has moved -181 pips from open. I'm slowly trying to fill in the variables. I have had a thought come to mind recently though. Perhaps this system isn't meant for an EA. I mean it could be, but to remain efficient maybe it shouldn't. Once I get the process down to finding the efficient points quickly it might be best to only use a years worth of data and redo the calculations once a week or daily depending on if you're playing a weekly or daily chart. So I would add this weeks data over the weekend to the calculations and take away the week that was one year ago. Since price movement evolves over time the system calculations should be able to do so as well. Anyways, just wanted to get that out. I'll try to determine the efficient trigger point given a 100 SL and that we must exit the trade once it has moved -181 from open. Matt

Great post PJ, might it be possible to share your excel spread sheet (since you've already got the formulas in the cells) and we could divide and conquer and keep up the back test data fresh daily?? Still trying to digest all you've written in the last post but the light bulb is trying to go on. grin. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Some quick looks show that for the data from these 22 down weeks, the optimum point for profit maximization would be an 81 pip straddle with 96 TP + 4 pip spread. This is with a given 100 SL. The SL determines the profits levels entirely. If we assumed to use the same straddle to the upside of 81 pips then there would have been 27 trades triggered in the 22 weeks since we are allowed 2 possible trades per candle; one long and one short. 17 of those trades would have ended in profit. 17 X 96 = 1632. 1632 - 1000 loss = 632 pips profit. 632/6 = 105 pips a month for down trades. I'm not sure how I should feel about that. Are those pips more guaranteed than any other system? 17 out of 27 trades is 63% correct. Would power of compounding make those 105 pips a month worth a lot in a year or two such that we're not bored with making only 105 pips? This is from a simple weekly system on down trades. I'm wondering what the results will be like when I look at a daily chart using a years worth of data. Will we be able to pull profits more consistently or frequently then that to produce 150 pips or more a month? I don't know about you, but I'm getting excited. I think a system such as this has more potential to survive the long run than most other systems based around emotion and chart reading. If we replace old data with new data to come up with new trigger and TP levels each week/day then it should keep us winning on the average for the current time no matter what type of trading is occuring. Anyone disagree with me or think I'm finding my efficient trigger and TP points incorrectly? Matt

Unfortunately FF doesn't accept the excel file type to upload to my post. If you want to PM me your email I'll be glad to send it that way. It's not really necessary though. Most of my calculations are very simple and I don't even bother to save my work sometimes since it takes only a minute to reproduce. KISS! Here is the spreadsheet from those 22 weeks in the previous post. &lt;TABLE style="WIDTH: 537pt; BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=715 border=0 x:str&gt;&lt;COLGROUP&gt;&lt;COL style="WIDTH: 48pt" span=6 width=64&gt;&lt;COL style="WIDTH: 59pt;

They include the date and OHLC. The next columns I had to figure out what we are concerned with in this system. We only care about maximums. So I originally took the data from all 52 weeks and did the following. Column "high - open" calculates the absolute up move from open. Column "open - low" calculates the absolute down move from open. Then I made a calculation to simply subtract the "high - open" column minus the "open - low" column. This gives us the values for the "up vs. down" column. In this case they're all negative because these are what I labeled as the down weeks. The movement to the downside was greater then that of the move to the upside. The up weeks are on another spread sheet. The last column, "frequency", is really the area of the bars on the graph I showed you. You need to sort the "open-low" column in descending order then label each row 1-22. The calculation for the frequency column would then be (1-22) X (open-low). This way the extreme move of .0471 multiplies by the number 1 since it only happened once out of the 22 weeks. The 111 pip move down would be multiplied by 22 since each down week would have moved at least 111 pips down. The maximum point in our "frequency" column is our efficient level that we can expect a price to move down on down weeks. This occurs when frequency = .3136 or when we expect a down week to move 196 pips down. Wow, sorry I messed up in my previous posts. Must be getting late for me to miss that. I'll wrap up this post and edit my previous posts. Just want to get my simple spreadsheets out there so you can all see what I'm doing. Matt

Ok a quick look again shows that if we expect a down week to move -196 pips from open then we should set our trigger around -122 or so. We can then take a profit of 66 and get 622 pips profit for the 6 months. But, you scream, "622 is less than 632 which was the expected profit when using -181 as our exit point." This is true. I think these calculations prove my point further that we should always be replacing the oldest data with the newest to keep up with current movement behaviors. This system is about averaging because we're basing everything on typical ranges and expectencies. In reality, the 196 pip movement is still the more profitable because all I need to do is say we should institute a 117 pip straddle with 79 TP. That would have eliminated all the counter trend moves and even 1 of the major trend moves that would have ended in a SL. In this case the profits would have been 16 X 79 = 1264 - 500 pip loss = 764 net profit. But this would involve us eliminating one of the 100 SL trades by placing our trigger 1 pip above the maximum counter trend value in hindsight to reduce our losses greatly. So the 196 expected move is still the profitable expected behavior. Perhaps we should have instituted the 117 trigger and 79 immediately after that one example week failed? Sorry, but I don't know how else to explain it without making things confusing. Anyways, digest that and let me know what you think. Thanks. Matt

As you can see, there are many "frequency" values similar to our efficient point of .422. I imagine that this is only because I am using very little data. If we used more data, such as many years worth, then there would be a certain point that is clearly the most efficient point. Anyways, I quickly found that somewhere around a 91 trigger with 116 TP is the most efficient. This would have produced 34 trades out of the 30 weeks. 20 would have ended in profit with 14 getting stopped out in our worst case scenerios. So 20 X 116 = 2320 - 1400 = 920 net pips for these 30 weeks. That's about 145 pips a month. Again, using a trailing 100 SL might help us with our profit margins tremendously. Or just using a 75 pip SL would work better. Not sure. Here's the problem. Our expected profits from this and previous posts are now thrown out the window. What can we expect if we use a 91 straddle with 116 TP on up moves and 122 straddle with 70 TP on down moves? In my previous down week calculations a lot of losing trades were thrown out because the straddle was too high. I imagine many may be thrown back in now. Let's take a look Out of the 52 weeks here is how things broke down. It was a delicate balance I'd say. Because when you combine the two systems of a 122 trigger and a 91 trigger, on the 91 trigger the opposing side, long entries, ends up better since fewer trades hit the -122 mark, on the short side, to create losing trades. On the other side, a 91 trigger hits more trades for the down week data and creates more losses. Anyways, on UP weeks we would have made profit the 20 times for 2360 profit. Then lost the 10 trades triggered. With the short side trigger -122 only 2 trades would have been triggered. Since the TP level is different for short trades too this means one would have ended in profit and one stopped out. Total profit for 30 weeks of up weeks is 1290. On down weeks we would have made our 620 profit, but the lower trigger on the up side of only 91 would have triggered 4 bad trades. Thus total profit out of 22 down weeks is only 220. 220+1290 = 1510 pips for the year or 125 pips per month. Again, not sure if I should be happy with that number or not. How will compounding play out with those pips as well as depositing more money into my account since I can expect to be in profit at the end of 52 weeks. I don't think I'd be throwing money away by doing so to increase my bank roll and available lots to intelligently place into a trade. Maybe I'll have to find a way to look at the up and down weeks at once so that triggers for up and down can be found at the same time to find a more happy equilibrium point. Sorry to post all this to make you all read it. Hope I'm not talking to myself though. All advice welcome! Matt

I guess I can't fall asleep when I've got stuff like this on my mind. I've already solved the problem of combining the two systems. Everything keeps getting simpler and simpler the more I think about it. What was the point of me splitting the data into UP versus down weeks? What do we care if its an up or a down week just so long as we get our profits? We don't, or at least shouldn't. So essentially you can throw away the "up vs down" column. It's useless now. All we're concerned with is the frequency, high-open, and open - low columns. You do need to have seperate sheets when you calculate frequency however. Apparently my initial observations were correct as far as what levels the frequencies come up with. For up moves we should still expect to close our trades after +211 pips from open. Because the years worth of data is used then we should expect different trigger points though. For down weeks the data was a little bit different. Again, I think this is because I'm only using 52 sets of data. So it shows maximum profit potential at closing trades after -161 pips. But I believe this to be an outlier in the data set and that -196 is still the best since it was the second highest frequency value in the set and appeared more normal in comparison. For up movement the new trigger and TP with a 4 pip spread would be an 81 straddle with 126 TP which is 81+126+4 = 211 total pip movement. For down movement we would set a trigger of 96 pips and TP after 96. So 96 + 96 + 4 = 196, our expected down movement. Do 211 or 196 seem unreasonable movements to expect? I'd say they'll happen pretty often, but not always. MONEY MANAGEMENT IS KEY. Those triggers aren't exact. I simply took the levels of 211 and 196 for the respective sides, then subtracted 100 as my TP+spread to find the trigger. Then I just worked out how much profit I would have made considering the successful trades minus the losing trades. As I decreased my TP on each I made the system more successful since the trigger could then be higher and allow less losing trades triggered, but I decreased my marginal profit on the winning trades. As I increased my TP I allowed for more losing trades, but increased my marginal profit on winning trades. I just found the balance somewhere in between that made the most profit. Again, I only went up and down by 10 pips to make quick judgements, so there are probably more precise numbers that will work better with more profit margins. I imagine the numbers will be so close it doesn't affect results too much though. So how much would the system have produced? It's better than I thought. On the up movements, +81 trigger with 126 TP and 4 pip spread for 211 total movement, would have made 1020 net pips. For down movements, -96 trigger with 96 TP and 4 pip spread for 196 total down movement, would have made 732 pips. Total pips out of the 52 weeks = 1752 or about 146 pips each month. Not bad huh? Better than the 125 pips in the previous month. I essentially just improved the efficiency of the system by 17% just by making my calculations easier. KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. Argh. I'll make another advocacy for the evolving system. Replace the oldest data set with the newest data set. There are different triggers and TP's because this year probably included more up weeks than down weeks. (It did as noted by my previous spreadsheets showing 30 up weeks vs. 22 down weeks.) So in the next year when there are more down weeks than up weeks the system will evolve to stay in a happy equilibrium. If you don't keep it updated it will correct your bank account for you! Now that I have found the calculations easily I think it could be a pretty useful system to run while you work full time. 10 minutes of figuring out profit maximizing points on a saturday while the market is off, and you're making 146 pips a month. Sounds pretty good right? And that's assuming worst case scenerios of our 100 SL getting hit on every trade that didn't complete itself that week. What about trades that win in the next weeks candle? Or what if we instituted a 100 trailing stop loss to cut down on our losses? It would greatly affect our results. More greatly affecting the results would be reducing the SL to 75 or so. I'm afraid of cutting into our winners though. Hope you all got something out of this. I think I have. Feel free to correct my thought process please. No one ever learned anything by being told they were always doing things right. TIA. Matt

Hi Matt, This may be a silly question - so don't shout at me - but what time (GMT) have you based your open and close on for the figures in the spreadsheet? Jilly

--- 帖子 #467 ---
This is real world stuff though, and I may sometimes fumble finger in the trades or miss add the trigger amounts. I am trying to be consistent. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Matt. lots of great thinking here. thanks for sharing all your findings. I have found a potential land mine here I think. When I went back over the last year, using weekly candles, 100 pip trigger and stop loss, and a 120 TP, I was excited to rack up 2400 + pips. BUT..... When I went back over the same weeks using daily candles, I found that many times my SL of 100 was hit before the TP was reached. This fact did not show up (was hidden) just using the weekly candles. So now I am back to the drawing board, doing my last year analysis only with daily candles but from a weekly point of view. I think we still have something here, just needs refinement.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Well my daily candles form at 5 pm, and I'm in Arizona. So I think that's 00:00 GMT. The above data is from a weekly chart though, so I don't think it matters what time the candles start. Matt

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I was afraid of this. Let me know what you come up with. I'm going to look into how the system does on a daily basis. My thinking is if we can find a good trigger and TP per candle to take even just 10-15 pips consistently, or 30-50 in a day then we can use a SL of 70 or more and eliminate the problem you just mentioned when using a weekly chart since there will be less time for a price to retrace that much in a day. I'll post results later. Matt

--- 帖子 #471 ---
traderone, sorry to repeat your thoughts here but just to get the main points of your idea straight you suggest: 100 pip trigger on both sides (a straddle) SL 100 pips TP 120 pips Is this correct? And you want to trade just during monday morning for the rest of the whole week (=one weekly candle)?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Actually I figured the trade on Sunday at 5PM EST on FXDD weekly charts. However when I looked back on daily charts I found there was movement within that weekly candle that was hidden, and may have sometimes triggered the SL without it showing up on the weekly candle. So now I am going back with my weekly method, but using daily candles for my testing.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Traderone, thanks for all the details posted in this thread. I read in previous posts that it is sugeested to trade only once during a week. In the original Kamanda posts he said he traded daily using previous day close price. That is still the intent, is that correct? Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I am testing the weekly method, but I am currently using my modified kamanda "daily" method as I described in a previous post. I think both are showing promise.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
by the way, as I told earlier I'm pretty new to this but I'm thinking the way we place the order so ahead of time it seems to me that Straddle functionality from the broker is not realy needed since it can easily be done manually I think. Place two longs and two shorts after 5 PM est. What do you think? by the way I'm still just using metatrader and haven't setlled down which broker to use yet.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Permanentjaun, Thanks for all your analysis. Kamanda claimed in earlier posts in this thread that he made more than 500 pips in october. He used OCO instead of Straddle. Maybe it is of interest to see with the amount of historical data that you have if that could be done? and if so what would the other months produce. Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #477 ---
You mean you want to know what the profits would have been if we allow only one trade per candle instead of allowing price to trigger both? Correct me if I'm misunderstanding you. Matt

--- 帖子 #478 ---
permanentjaun, it seems that Kamanda was doing the OCO order so one trade based on previous day closed (5PM EST). Although the setup is of course one long and one short. Seems like an easy setup and he claims with high resulting PIPs. Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Kamanda was placing a straddle at 5 PM EST. 55 was his long trigger and 35 was his short trigger. His target was 50 pips but he often watched the trade and sometimes got a little more than 50. He said that very few trades were stopped for losses.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Kamanda also said that he would often double up if the price went the opposite way. For example, if he was in a long and it reversed and stopped out and triggered his short straddle, he would double up the lot size on the short trade. Also PermJuan, don't worry you're not talking to yourself in this thread! I'm enjoying and interested in your additions. (and everyone else too) B

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Still not entirely sure what you're asking me. I hadn't followed kamandas system much since it was just a 55 and 35 straddle. OCO order is just "one cancels other" order. So he is still straddling, but only allowing for one trade a candle. So I don't know how to give you results then what I've already given except only allowing for one trade a candle. Possible, but then I think you alter the system too much. traderone has mentioned that he would let some trades run longer than 50 pips. As soon as you do that you affect the expected payout of the system dramatically such that its no longer the same system. How does he know which times to let it run and when to stop it at 50? I'm trying to find something that is proven to work consistently. Unfortunately traderone pointed out that 100 SL on a weekly chart may not be enough. I'll have to look at my results again, but perhaps a 150 SL would still produce good results. I'll ask the question now then. At what point do we consider the system worthy of being traded? When we can average 100 pips a month? 150? 200? What is successful for this system? Traderone - I haven't looked at a daily chart yet, but when you say the 100 SL doesn't work are you saying the price will rise say 100 pips. We enter a trade. It then retraces 100+ pips and then rockets 200-300 pips up to close up 200-300 pips? Or were you speaking in terms of being stopped out if using a trailing SL? Not sure if that would really change the question. Matt

Does anyone know of a good forex broker with a spread on gbp/usd of 3 pips or less. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions. MR. DETROIT

This question probably deserves a thread of it's own. {if it doesn't exist already} Borker Spreads are a beast unto theirown.

I meant when we only look at the weekly candles in backtesting, we can miss instances where on the 1 hour or daily charts the trade was triggered (say at a +100 move), then retraced to stop out at 100, then once again shot back up to hit what we set for take profit. On the weekly charts those activities can sometimes be hidden and we would count a win, when in fact we would see on the daily or hourly charts that it was a loss. I was not using any kind of trailing stop in this instance. At this point I think even to test a weekly strategy we have to use at least the daily charts to get more accurate data.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Let me know what you find. I've had a very long week with family in town for thanksgiving. A more definite idea of what happens is needed. If we need to increase the SL to 150 then it greatly affects what our straddle and TP levels are. Let me know what you find. Thanks. Matt

--- 帖子 #487 ---
What is the stop loss on 55 -35 straddle ? is the stop loss the same on both sides?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
using the base mark`s strategy with 20 pips SL from london open i lost many pips today ... i think it was not a very good day for GBP/USD and this strategy today .. what was ur performance for today ?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Greetings all, hope your holiday weekend (those that had one!) was a nice one. I've read through this thread a couple of times from a to z and am following with interest as stated in a couple of my prior posts as i trade mostly volatilaty breakouts and the idea of trading the DRS style suits me. One thing i might suggest is as this thread began as a "Daily" Range Strategy, to bring the "Daily" focus back into the thread. . . I'm all for seeing good things come out of the idea of a "Weekly" RS, and maybe Perma could begin a companion thread called "Weekly Rage Strategy" or similar?? It might also do this thread some good (The strict DSR model) if at some point in time there was a DSR II by Micardo with the idea of keeping the thread pure? LOL. If that is possible! Just my ramblings, i appreciate EVERY post in this thread! In no way is the above intended to stiffle any thoughts. Perma: I have thoroughly enjoyed your insightful posts on using the Weekly candles; very informative and thought provoking as i've stated before. . . though i think a thread devoted to the weekly would show more focused responses from some others. One thing that comes to mind is having such a thread might bring in thoughts/posts by such greats as James16 and Dialist who look at such long term charts in their trade setups and they might be able to add their 2 pips worth to such a thread. My Best to all : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #490 ---
accrete, I understand. Sorry for side tracking with the weekly discussion. That only began because I would be able to use a years worth of data in only a few candles and not 260+ day candles. It was also because of the observation of weekly candles having smaller shadows and probably more suitable for this type of system. I'm afraid branching off into a weekly thread wouldn't be good. The concepts are the same for a daily and weekly player. I worry that we still haven't found the key to this system and that by splitting the thread we will split the people putting input into it. If we can find what works on a daily chart then we'll know what works on a weekly chart. I'll try to do some analyzing on a daily chart from now on. Matt

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I hate to dissappoint you accrete, but I'm going to present another strategy using this system. What if we used it intraday? Hehe. Hate me yet accrete? Anyways, the idea is based on the observation that movement only really occurs during certain hours of the day. Take a look at a 2 hour chart. The majority of the candles have small ranges from their high to low. Then there a the handful of candles that have long real bodies of nearly 100 pips. It's also apparent on a 1 hour chart. As soon as you said breakout accrete it made it come to mind. The problem is that this system would absolutely have to be automated. Sitting at the computer for every new 1 hour or 2 hour candle would be too time consuming. I'm just throwing the idea out there. Matt

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I agree with Matt, the idea is to find the best strategy for Daily Range by making use of the weekly bars. howard

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Mark you can bet I'll let you know what I find out using the daily's for a weekly strategy. I'm with you on recovering from Thanksgiving. I'll be studying the charts hard though starting on Tuesday. Breakout strategies are , I think, some of the most valid in trading. I think looking at the major Market Opens would be beneficial. Studying what trigger and TP and SL figures would work at the London and New York opens might be rewarding. I will look at that also.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I have to say that I've given up with my version of MarkJ's system of trading a straddle around the London open. Even with increasing the straddle from 20 to 22 pips it's still not delivering the sort of reliability or pips that I'm looking for. Over the weekend I sat down and broke the results down into months and it didn't look too good. In the figures below I have deducted the 3 pip spread, so all figures are net. The target is 20 pips (net) and the stop loss is 25 pips (28 with spread). June 92 pips July -4 pips August 180 pips September 216 pips October 236 pips November (to date) 128 pips Taking the 5 complete months June - October the win ratio is 73.9% and the positive expectancy is only 2.02. I'm afraid for me this is far too hit and miss. When it's good, it's exceedingly good, but when it's not its quite dire. Consistency seems to be the key thing here and this system I'm afraid, doesn't seem to have it. I'm still taking note of the weekly straddle that you're looking at in this thread, although for me I wouldn't want to trade it. I prefer to be in and out of a trade within the day. So the intraday straddle you mention would suit me just fine - 2 hr charts? Yes, I can work with that.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
JillyB - even though they are all positive (except July little loss) don't you think that is good? At $10 a lot that would be nice I would think.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Greetings Matt. LOL. We are all in this together my friend. I would never hold at fault anyone (such as yourself) attempting to help further a good cause such as what we have here! Trust me when i restate that i'm all for the weekly data being in the mix. . . and intraday? Hahaha. As i type during the NY session's new releases i'm watching price on 5 min candles and my first TP was hit for some nice pips in the bank with several more lots now locked in profit. The only indicators on my nearly naked charts is a simple harmonic-beat/daily OHML thingy on the 5m chart i made, and a TL/Channel drawn on the longer term charts with audio alerts to get me to the computer as price penetrates the levels. Keep the good thoughts comin' Matt. I'm here to add what i can, rub elbows with some nice folk, and see us all with pips in the bank : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Traderone, With your version of the kamanda trade, do you keep the trade on through news? For example, this morning with durable goods news, do you hold the trade? Thanks for all your comments, Tom

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I'm starting to wonder how accurate my data is. I'm not sure if the process I used to find the correct levels is correct. How should I factor in spread? How should I factor in SL? I want to be able to look at the numbers with the SL and spread in the charts to see the maximum profit levels rather than doing guess and check till I get there. Any ideas anyone? Matt

--- 帖子 #499 ---
someone HELP!!!! I want to play the 22 straddle with tp 23 and sl 25 i don't know how to setup the trade with a 5 pip spread. can someone please illustrate it for me assuming for example the london open is at 1.9500. mr. detroit

--- 帖子 #500 ---
buy 1.9527 sell stop-loss 1.9497 (25s/l + 5 spread = 30 total) sell limit 1.9545 (23 - 5 spread = 18 net) If you wanted 23 net profit, limit would be 1.9550. I wouldn't do that with the s/l though. sell 1.9478 buy stop-loss 1.9508 (in trade system 1.9508 is the ask price. When the ask is this, the bid is 1.9503, which is 25s/l) buy limit 1.9460 (same thing) You need to make an excel spreadsheet and put formulas in. It is a whole lot easier just plugging in some numbers and let excel calculate the numbers to use than doing it in your head. I got a headache giving you the example.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I use the raw data for the straddle, then subtract/add spread to tp and s/l after each trade.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
No not even then. The efficient points for maximum profit are different for if you use a 30 or 50 SL. Even if you use a 20 trigger the TP levels will vary depending on your SL. I'm having a tough time figuring out what is best except by trial and error. I'm questioning if the figures I posted are accurate because if we alter the SL then it alters everything else. Hard to say what I'm getting at. Just right now I'm pretty burnt out trying to figure out how to analyze the data.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Well I wrote a program that takes the 15 m date since 1999, breaks it down by day and year and allows for different straddle on a daily basis. Trust me, nothing works consistently. The only way to win is to find the best straddle that prevents the most consecutive losing days in a row and double up when you lose, and hope it isn't 2002, 2003, and 2004. You have to wonder whether the retail side of forex is changing things enough that those years didn't work. I don't know.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Also, I don't understand what you are talking about really. If I use a 70 straddle using bid price of 1.9000, the straddle is 1.9075(ask) and 1.8930 (BID) that is raw data. If I want a 30 pip profit, on long side I sell at 1.9105(BID) or 1.9110 ask. The ask price is 35 pips - 5 pip spread gives 30. All I care about is whether the bid price hits 1.9105, then it is a winner. Same with s/l.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Because changing the SL affects the system. Using a 70 straddle takes away a lot of potential plays. Perhaps it only reaches 70 pips to the upside 20% of the time. What TP do you set? Well a 10 pip TP will be hit 60% of the time, 20 TP 40% of the time, 30 TP 20% of the time. What should your TP then be? It depends on if you're using a 20, 30, or 40 SL. As you increase the TP, your SL gets hit more often since less and less trades end successfully. It's the idea that you can win 99 times out of 100 and make 5 pips per trade for a net gain of 495 pips. There's going to be that one losing trade, and the system is bad if on that trade you lose 500 pips. -5 pips for the 100 trades. The SL affects the risk/reward potential and therefore the equilibrium point shifts around it. It has to do with the marginal profits of increasing your TP. How much marginal profit does a 20 SL or 50 SL give when you want to look for 5 more pips in TP? If 5 more trades lose because of the higher TP is that another 100 pips in the loss category or 250? It's a big deal determining the system around the SL.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
yes you are exactly right. That is why you need to have a separate program to play with the s/l. In my program, you can change the s/l for any given day of week (or everyday) and re-process the data. It looks at each consecutive 15 m candle to determine if the s/l is hit. If it is, it records the highest pip value to that point (minus the spread). The 5 pip spread is then added to the s/l. So if I were using 70 straddle, with a 30 tp and 30 s/l, then 25 is recorded as profit OR 35 is recorded as s/l depending on what I want. The thing is that I believe I have found the perfect straddle on gbp/usd, and most days of the week the straddle works, but not on other days. Changing the other days works well. However, using the same criteria for 2005 does not produce positive results. BUT maybe it isn't meant to all be positive, but a higher percentage of wins, so that when you lose, you double up to negate the losses. I can tell you the straddle I am using didn't start working on its own (without doubling up) until April 2006, but has since worked and continues to work. At what point does it stop though? That is the question.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Partly why I believe that this system works best by having a revolving data set. Meaning the oldest data should be replaced by the newest. That was it evolves over time along with the trading pattern of the currency. Another way it will work is to use data spanning years and years such that all trading patterns are covered. I used the methods in my previous posts to look at all the data on a weekly chart back to 1987. Yes, 1987. For up weeks I originally found that we should be exiting our trades after 211 pips. That was using only 52 weeks of data. It wasn't too far from the 19 year data equilibrium. Out of 19 years of weekly data, looking to exit after 188 pips up is the most efficient point. Like I said, it's not always an exact science.

As you can see 186-189 seems to be a sweet spot to take profits at. 211 is near the top as well, so we wouldn't have been too bad using just this years data. Don't be alarmed that only one of those dates is 2006. Those are only the dates that those weeks stopped at meaning there are probably plenty of recent dates hitting 186+ pips in an upmove. We know this to be true. Perhaps this was still the correct way to find the efficient level at which we close our trades. llambert3 - I'm going to need your help finding a correct SL level. Again, it's going to be a balance to figure that out. If we get 100 pips profit from the successful trades, what happens with a 100 SL? Does it prevent 2 trades from becoming successful? What if we reduce the SL to only 70. Does it then prevent 5 trades from being successful? It still might be better to do so though if in all the losing trades it saves us more than 500 pips from being lost. Or cutting off 17 of the losing trades earlier than normal. Get what I mean? This is, again, why basing this type of system around the SL is so important. Matt

Just to keep things kosher with accrete, if you're looking at the strategy for a daily system then the efficient point to exit long trades would be around 89-94 pips above the open. The trigger is unknown considering I don't know what SL to use. That determines the trigger and TP.

I think if we try to analyze the same data from intraday charts then new ways of formulating things are required. Using the same methods for the intra day charts doesn't work. According to the same methods, the most pips are available for up trades if we exit our trade after it has moved 12 pips. The reason is because most of the data on a 2 hour chart is full of small candles during periods of inactivity. This strategy really isn't a break out strategy. It's an average strategy. Hehe, I mean that in a good way. The average 2 hour candle isn't very large. So if you want to play the average 2 hour candle you're only looking for small profits since the large candles don't happen on average. This gets me thinking more about the strategy. It brings me back to my question from a few days ago, "When do we know the system is successful? If we can average 100 pips a month? 150? 200?" Playing the average candle isn't going to give us 500 pip months or weeks. It's not going to usually give us -500 pip months months or weeks. What are we looking for in terms of profit? You can't push this type of system past it's limits. It will correct itself in the long run. Beauty of equilibriums. Matt

What are the weekly triggers? You are saying you can't determine a trigger until you know a s/l, but you have to play with numbers to determine what that is. For instance I can write a program that given a trigger, tells the greatest stop loss after the trigger, but before the target. I can use your suggestion of 188 pips for weekly, and if that is hit, what the highest s/l would've been PRIOR to the 188 being hit. The trades that don't hit the 188 target within a week could possibly be excluded from the calculations since we are only interested in the s/l point before the 188 target is hit, and only if it is hit. In other words if we buy, but the trade goes down 200 pips, then reverses and eventually hits the 188 target, then 200 would be the highest s/l needed so far. Does that make sense or am I missing something? That would get us a start anyway. We may find it drop 300 or 400 pips before reversing. At some point you have to just take the loss and move on instead of hoping, so we'd have to see I suppose. Gone to bed so can't respond for 9+ hours.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Oh and are we only buying long trades, higher highs? You keep saying something about up weeks. At the start of a week, we don't know it is an up week, so are you using the prior week? Confused.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I think that's the catch 22. I can't tell you a trigger until you tell me a SL. The numbers I just gave you, the 188, is the point at which we EXIT the trade. Meaning it was the most efficient number out of all the data in the up weeks where it was hit the most and was also a number to give us a high pip count. For example, 200 could have been hit 100 times for 20000 pips, but 180 was hit 200 times to give us 36000 pips to play with. Get what I'm saying? We want to know the best point to play with the most pips such that it's easiest to get our pips out of the move. So this means the trigger should actually be somewhere inbetween 0 and 188 pips. If the trigger is 60 pips then our TP is 128. If the trigger is 100 pips then our TP is 88. It depends on what the SL is because the lower the trigger, the more trades are triggered that won't be successful. With a higher SL, then the more trades triggered means much more hurt to our profits. How do I know when they're up weeks? I don't. I don't care. Remember my post saying to get rid of the "up vs down" column? This meant that I am analyzing all the up movements at once. So my data includes some weeks where the up move was only 10 pips. It also includes data of weeks where it went up 900 pips. What my data is showing is what type of move we can expect with pips going north from the open. Since there will be weeks where it will end negative, but there will still be significant up movement, we need to look at all data from every week at once. So when I say up week data I really mean its data from weekly charts showing the up movement we should expect. Sorry to confuse you. Let me know if I'm still not explaining it clearly. Matt

--- 帖子 #514 ---
ok got it. I'll restate it to make sure though. I will use the open of every single weekly candle. From the open of that candle "play" with a tp of 188 pips from that open. So whatever trigger I use I'll subtract from 188 to determine the pip target. Then I'll figure out what the best s/l may be based on that information, if it is all possible.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Correct, except again, you need the SL to figure trigger and you need the trigger to figure SL. I don't know what is the better way to go about it.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
yeah well it is all a headache but easier when a program does it. By the way is this GMT weekly open we are using?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I think so. My candles open at 5 pm and I'm in Arizona. So yea, GMT 00:00. Not to confuse things more, but if we find the best figures for this strategy we should then find the best time of day to form the candles, see what that does to our numbers. There's just too many variables. You're going to need to have your program set SL as a given and calculate the different triggers from there. We all know having two variables in the math equation does nothing for coming up with a real answer.

Hi guys, I got the fine daily high/low indicator, but I am looking for daily candle BODY indicator. Pls see this link: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ad.php?t=10770 Thanks for any help, FT

FingoTrader, The Pattern recognition, is this the one you after? if so here it is Cheers

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi Mark, thanks for your reply. The indicator you kindly posted is not what I had in mind. Basically what I need is the same as the high/low indicator, but only indication of (via horisontial lines) the high/low of the previous daily candle BODY. Hope this is possible. FT

can anyone recommend a good forex broker with a gbp/usd spread of 3 pips or less. i currently use FXCM and they suck big time. mr detroit

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I've been following the post and find interest in this trading method. I have been having success using gbp/jpy along with a 50/50 straddle put in at 0000gmt with gbp/usd.. i use a 50/50 with it as well 30 limit/stop.. also have been testing with a 20ts and 70 limit.. the gbp/jpy does seem to move more directly up or down than gbp/usd.. the spread of course is more.. im just demo with it for now but it is a fast mover.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi FT, i just hacked into one of my indicators and added the prior day's close (yellow line). You can download the indicator here . In order to keep the code simple and clean i did not put the prior day's open, only it's close. You can easily see where the prior closes were with the Yellow line and extend the line yourself manualy for a good visual of the candle's Open/Close, or it's "Body". Also the day's high, low, and median is there. Hope this helps in your pippage. In the below image i have the indicator shifted 1 day. So the levels you see are the HLCM of yesterday. I placed two orange DASHed lines to indicate yesterday's close, and the day before yesterday. This would indicate the area of yesterday's "Body" with a bit of manual elbow grease...but it never hurts to get a bit dirty with placing some manual lines and getting involved with the chart in my book.

Just wanted to post a further update on my modified Kamanda system. Been trading this since Nov7. I trade two units. Take profit at 25 pips on the first and 50 on the second. If the second hasn't closed by around 9 AM EST I close it whatever. Trigger is now 54 long and 40 short. SL is 50 long and 40 short. Using the 5 PM EST open (or close however you look at it). I deleted all of the cancelled trades that weren't triggered. I call it karamba just for fun.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Kamanda claimed to have made a million with this technique..( peaks everyones interest), however, he would double up and reverse if his stop was hit. Wonder what his results would be without doing that..

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Accrete, thank's a million , I will try it out asap. FT

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Traderone: Why did you change the triggers and the stop loss levels from the original kamanda? Also, I guess you do not double-up and reverse on a stop-loss?

--- 帖子 #529 ---
The results are really encouraging. I'll try this strategy during December and see how it goes. What I really like in this strategy is the emotionless way of trading. Having a full time job this strategy suits my trading approach. Thanks traderone for the update.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thanks Justin. I slightly modified Kamanda's settings just to suit me personally. I like the long trigger of 50 + 4 pips for my spread. Changed the short trigger to 40 instead of 35, and I may change it again to 50 in the future. I would have won more pips today if I had NO stop loss at all, but I'm not willing to go there. I agree that this is an emotionless way to trade. I think the summer months may not be profitable (low movement). I don't "double up" or anything at this point because here in the USA basically I set my trades before I go to bed and then around the New York open when I wake up I check to see how the night went. By the way, I am demoing on another account the Micardo method of range trading. It has been even a little better than Karamba. Check out his posts for his settings.

last week saw some good volatility in the market.. mostly bad for the dollar but with this type of trading, movement is movement.. i too am setting up the same straddles with gbp/usd.. i mentioned before the gbp/jpy straddle,..last week over 200 pips doing a 50/50 straddle with a 30 net stop and a 75 limit with 20ts..gbp/jpy has finally come out of a 50 pip range..i will stay with the various straddles with gbp/usd also..all trades go in at 00 00 gmt

As you can see the pound dollar after a 200 pip run has already retraced to the 23.6 fib level and a little more then half way to the 38.2 fib level and now has began to rise away from it. The frequencey of it hitting the 38.2 is about .455% of the time. So more then likely it will stay above that level. It seems like everyone has accepted the fact that it will rise to 2.000 so there appears to be no psychological barrier there. It appears that way.

Below is some information in regards to what the pound does in comparison to the dollar in the month of December. Hope this helps. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; This information came from the cable update thread post #240 on page 16.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; British pound – US Dollar (GBP/USD) The sterling appreciated against the U.S. dollar in the month of December, 14 out of the past 20 years times which is roughly 70 percent of the total sample. Like the EUR/USD, the seasonality factor was stronger in the last 10 years with the GBP/USD appreciating 8 years out of the last 10 samples. On average, the GBP/USD gained 2.37 percent during the positive months and lost only 1.15 percent during the negative months.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; GBP/USD closed on Nov. 30 1.9653. A 2.37 gain is 466 pips which would be 2.0119. A 1.15 loss would be 226 pips to finish the year 1.9327.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = v ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" /&gt;&lt;v:shapetype id=_x0000_t75 stroked="f" filled="f" path="m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe" o referrelative="t" o:spt="75" coordsize="21600,21600"&gt;&lt;v:stroke joinstyle="miter"&gt;&lt;/v:stroke&gt;&lt;v:formulas&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="if lineDrawn pixelLineWidth 0"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="sum @0 1 0"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="sum 0 0 @1"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="prod @2 1 2"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="prod @3 21600 pixelWidth"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="prod @3 21600 pixelHeight"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="sum @0 0 1"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="prod @6 1 2"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="prod @7 21600 pixelWidth"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="sum @8 21600 0"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="prod @7 21600 pixelHeight"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;v:f eqn="sum @10 21600 0"&gt;&lt;/v:f&gt;&lt;/v:formulas&gt;&lt;v ath o:connecttype="rect" gradientshapeok="t" o:extrusionok="f"&gt;&lt;/v ath&gt;&lt;o:lock aspectratio="t" v:ext="edit"&gt;&lt;/o:lock&gt;&lt;/v:shapetype&gt;&lt;v:shape id=_x0000_i1025 style="WIDTH: 446.25pt; HEIGHT: 232.5pt" alt="" type="#_x0000_t75"&gt;&lt;v:imagedata o:href="http://www.dailyfx.com/export/sites/dailyfx/story-images/2006/11/special_report/Pictures/Seasonality11.22.2006img2.gif" src="file:///C:/DOCUME~1/Owner/LOCALS~1/Temp/msoclip1/01/clip_image001.gif"&gt;&lt;/v:imagedata&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; __________________ Emotions And Money Don't Mix &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Sorry about the double post. When I posted this message it said FF was having heavy loads. Had to type it all up again and liked the second version better. It's the post below this one. Matt

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hello all, I haven't posted here in a while, but I have been thinking about this topic still. In the meantime I've been reading up on things such as grid trading, martingale, Hans method, etc.. I also haven't posted because I had the feeling my results from backtesting were pointing to a grim picture for the daily range strategy. Why am I posting though? I am coming back to this threads idea. The grid system is really what made it clear though. Grid trading doesn't use trend lines or chart formations. It simply uses hedging and price movement to stay on the right side of the trade. My broker, GFT, does not have hedging or EA capabilities though. So it was simple. All I had to do was take the "daily" out of the daily range strategy. I'm proposing that you simply place straddles from any current price on a chart. There's no need to bring time into this. I think something along the lines of a 200 pip straddle should be used such that it really reduces our risk of getting caught in a ranging market. Ranging markets are the devil. We won't get a trade every day, but perhaps the profits would be much more consistent? Therefore thats why I'm wondering if perhaps a martingale strategy of doubling up on losers could produce great profits. You just need an account large enough to be able to handle it. Slow steady profits. Or if a trade is stopped out immediately enter a position in the direction of the new trend at the point you get stopped out. Hope to profit off of that to overcome the previous losing trade. I think doubling up might be more fruitful. 80 good trades out of 100, with effective money management I could probably be able to double up several times in case I do happen to lose several times in a row; which begins to become severely unlikely. I think the difference would be this system exits the market to create a new trade and then double up on that trade. A true martingale strategy keeps adding to a losing position and doesn't exit the market until either profits are realized or the account has a margin call. (Ouch) When you exit the market and look for the new trade. It's new conditions so you're trading to find the trend again rather than bet that the same current trend will stop. When you try to predict tops/bottoms/reversals you get eaten up in trading. So say price is 1.9000. Place a buy order at 1.9200 and sell at 1.8800. I haven't figured out TP yet, but I'm thinking 40-50. So when a trade ends in success then find the new levels. With a 50 TP on the buy order we would be out of the market at 1.9250. Your next trade levels would be 1.9450 and 1.9050 for buy and short respectively. What do you all think? This works just like the daily range strategy because the market is always moving either up or down. When you think about it, the daily range strategy could have been implemented at any point in the day. Waiting for the new candle was really just to give us the new point to base our straddle off of. So why wait for a new candle? Just keep making trades as they come. I proposed 200 pips such that we're out of the daily range of trading and for price to move 200 pips it has to trend somehow. What do you all think? Matt

Mark..... What would the stop loss be on this new grid system? You mentioned that we would place a trade in the other direction when we are stopped out, but I didn't catch what the stop loss would be. I've played with grids quite a bit with only so-so results. The reason I find the daily range methods interesting is because we have used some historical performance figures on which to base our "trigger" points. Usually on the GBPUSD, if the price moves 50 or 55 points from the opening, it will not come all the way back. I think that Vegas quotes that around 70% of the time, for that pair, that is true. So that is where we start. Somebody here experimented with 60 or 61 also and found it workable. What we need to do is find the best range for the TP in order to smooth out our equity curve. We could indeed straddle "breakouts" from anyplace on the charts, but I think for them to succeed more often than fail, they should be triggered using some historical patterns to gain any kind of edge. I have the past few weeks had remarkable success using Micardo's trigger of 50 either way from the FXDD opening price. To a lesser extent with the Kamanda method of a smaller trigger on shorts. I don't plan to trade on Thursday or Friday this week due to the NFP on Friday. Don't expect much movement on Thursday and the wrong kind of movement on Friday!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Well the new idea would have to be worked out between each individual person. When looking for such massive movements on a chart, it probably wouldn't be wise to use a 30-40 SL unless we're looking for only 30-50 TP. A larger 100 SL may be needed. I haven't played with any numbers yet. Should the straddle be only 150? Should we only take 30-50 TP? 100? I think a 200 straddle with 100 TP is asking for too much movement. If you want 100 TP then lower the straddle, but then you risk getting stuck in a ranging market. You're right there is the flaw that it doesn't necessarily use historical data that is easy to play with. It is going to be a game of guess and check, or manually calculating the amplitude in a ranging market and the amiplitude of a trending market. But I can say the daily range strategy is also inherently flawed too. Its a price action system that relies much on time. If price gradually rises, the point to base the straddle off of moves with each time, and the overall movement is missed when no triggers are hit. It's also possible for the system to enter trades counter to the direction of the trend. I'm simply basing this theory off the idea that for price to move so much it must be trending in that direction and therefore more likely to give us pips. It's filtering out the noise just like the original daily strategy. Only problem I'm really seeing is the lack of trades made with a 200 straddle. From 7/12-9/11 it would have only made 8 trades. 6 winners and 2 losers. This was a 200 straddle, 50 TP, 100 SL. I doubled up on the trades following losers to bring the total pips to 200 for the 2 months. 100 pips a month. Not to impressive, but oh well. The point though, is that perhaps we don't need a time frame on the chart. In fact I think that may hurt us. What if the market ranges and the opens for several candles are very close together? You're stuck in the range. If you abandon time frames and using opening prices for straddle points, you can use random points which could inherently move your straddle outside of a range, or at least be able to profit from it. This just something to be discussed. Who's mark? Matt

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thanks for your well thought reply, Matt! I think Mark is on another breakout thread..... I'm getting too old for this Yes it is possible to get "stuck" in ranges. But then I think that's why we call it a "breakout" strategy rather than a grid. I think that is why it is also a good idea to let the trades, when correct, run for more than 30 pips. We could have several losers in ranging days, but then when you catch a couple of 100 or 150 pip runners that all goes away! Just thinking out loud. Thanks for your continuing thoughts. It's good to bounce these around I think.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
How do we let winners run though? When do we know they'll be winners? How long do we let them run? I don't think a system as simple as this one can answer these questions. In my line of thinking it may be evolving that way though. I'm trying to think of different ways of implementing the system. What if we could use hindsight to our advantage? How would it work? With a large 200 pip straddle it's possible. Rather than taking random entry points, what if we waited for a peak or valley to form on the chart, then base our entry point off of that high or low? Most likely, on an intraday chart, it is easy to see a peak or valley before it moves 200 pips. But then, how do we judge if a trend will continue for 700 pips and we can take advantage of it? It might require that we take out profits from playing the peak/valley observation idea, PVO method (hehe), as well as the original idea of placing a 200 pip straddle towards the direction of the current trend. If the trend doesn't reverse you'll enter another trade in the same direction. If it reverses, which it most likely will, you look for the peak/valley, PVO, to base a new 200 pip straddle. Just more thoughts to throw in the game. I'm sure this could be implemented on many different time frames with varying SL, TP, and trigger levels. Matt

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I think taking note of the strong trends is a very valid way of playing breakouts. With the peaks and valleys you would be setting up a sort of trend line system. Then, we could be back to trading the "breakout" of the trendlines. And there we are back to price action trading. You know Matt, I think we are getting very close here to good things.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Ha. You're getting that feeling too? Just today I was taking a shower and thinking, man I think we're getting really close to a system that is consistent, profitable, and easy to manage. We're just one step away from something nice and easy to trade. I hate not being at that next step. In regards to your two lot trading, it could be possible. Since we're looking for the breakouts or trends then if we're already in a trade it could provide us with the extra pips more often then not. I come back to the idea though that if we could find the efficient point to have all trades exit it would be more profitable than a system of one lot exiting early and one exiting late. The system pretty much guarantees 10 pips when looking for the 200 pip move. Does that mean we should only exit after 10 pips? Well, maybe if you place 50% of your account into the one trade to make up in dollars what you dont make in pip quantity. I wouldn't recommend it just for sake of mental stability. This could be one of the options traders have to decide between. I think I like the one lot system just so I'm in and out of the trade looking for the next set up. If we look for 50 pips we'll say the system is 70% correct. (Not sure of that figure) Looking for 60 pips is 60%, 70 pips 50%. I'd rather take the 50 pips and always stay at 70% than introduce more risk into the system. If you create a two part position then you're averaging the risk. It would be just as effective as playing a single exit point for all lots that was equal to the average risk of looking for maybe 30 pips on the first lot and 80 pips on the second. Thats a decision that has to be made by each trader though. Anyways, evolving into a price action system with trendlines. Is that so bad? Are we discussing something new and different or should we just abandon the idea of looking for pip movements and just play a trendline and S/R chart system? How are we different? I don't know yet. Matt

--- 帖子 #547 ---
matt, I have started coding the weekly idea you had, we had a major change at work, so I lost some extra time to work on it. But now you are not so certain of it. Should I stop trying? Second, on your idea of a 200 wait or whatever and using any time in general, to me it would just be better to buy immediately and hope it goes your way. If it doesn't average out until you can get out. I just can't see how waiting that long for only 50 pips in the long run can be worth it without a starting point, BUT the wild idea sometimes ends up being the best, so I won't count it out yet. Regarding the daily strategy, the 60 wait is a good start, but turns out 2004 and 2005 and Jan - April of 2006 it was not good overall. I may have some good numbers though for all years.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
llambert - Keep on trying. Always forward test though. I think what my results had found is that it probably does need to be an evolving system of changing the efficient levels for the trigger, sl, and tp. I'm trading for the long term. I don't want the system to work for a year and then go sour on me. So when backtesting a system using over a decades worth of data it showed that there were good years and there were bad years where it would only average out to 30 pips a month or so. This was using one SL,TP, and trigger over all the years. Your results may vary. So if you are going to use the weekly idea then you should probably always be shifting the numbers over time. Only use a year or two worth of data and update the numbers week by week. Unfortunately that means you're only using 52 - 104 candles worth of data. Not sure how reliable it would be. The long time frame might be enough to give it reliability though. Anyways, I am probably going to abandon it for the reasons I'm discussing now. I can do the same thing, irregardless of a time frame, correctly pick areas of S/R and probably increase my success rate. You say average out till you can get out. Do you mean using the martingale method to add to your losing position since eventually the price will retrace? Sure it works so long as your bank roll is huge. The other idea is like I said of immediately entering a reverse position once you are stopped out. I'd rather double up on the next trade though. Martingale method involves placing trades to fight the current trend your already losing against. I'd rather get out, reset the system, then find the trend more accurately again. See the difference? The idea of waiting for the 200 pips though is to prevent you from being placed in a ranging or reversing market. If you institute an always in system then there is just as much a chance of the play turning on you once you enter the reverse position. When you are out of the market and wait for it to absolutely move in one direction then you reduce your risk in that manner tremendously. Sure, maybe its only 50 pips after a 200 pip move. (BTW I'm thinking a 150 pip move might be sufficient. Need to play with it.) I have asked a couple times, but received no answer. How many pips does one need to be considered trading a successful system? I've read threads about "10 pips a day to success" and other such ideas. Trading the simple system of doubling up after losing trades and waiting for 200 pips to take 50 produced 100 pips a month from 7/12-9/11. This is far from averaging 10 pips a day, but its a start. I'll post a chart later to show how my new ideas would be traded as well as a year or two worth of manual 2 hour chart backtesting. How much will using hindsight to find peak/valleys work? Should we look for 100 TP? 50 TP? I'd love to be able to say taking 100 TP is consistent, because if we can do that and double up after the losers then we're trading it such that our account is as if the last trade was also successful. With a 50 TP 100SL we'd need to triple up after a losing trade to make it seem as if the losing trade actually profited. Up to the trader and their bank account really. The problem that may arise from the daily/weekly strategy is that its being curve fit. If its constantly updated, can it last? I'm not sure. I'm only leaning in this direction because there is no need for excel spreadsheets to find equilibrium points. It's simple add/subtract from current price levels. Monitor the charts to find peaks/valleys. And with less work it could actually prove more effective since it finds support/resistance which are disregarded in the daily and weekly range strategies. I'm trying to play the same system, but simpler and more effective. Isn't that what we're looking for? Matt

--- 帖子 #549 ---
My point I was trying to make about averaging a trade going against you was it would seem simpler and just as successfull as waiting 200 for 50 using ANY GIVEN point in time. In other words to me it just doesn't seem logical. If this were a weekly strategy with a beginning time to use I wouldn't have a problem with it. I was actually just comparing the two. I want &gt;5000 pips a year, so &gt;400 a month would do - for me anyway. Yes it seems doubling up should help in my other program it does anyway. Most lots open at one time since 2003 has been 6, meaning the 6th time you'd have to purchase 32 lots to get rid of the losses. Need at least 5k in a mini account to accomplish this. I think probably 10k in a standard.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
If we're talking about the same thing there is a difference. If you're averaging the trade, i.e. using the martingale method, then you've lost the original trade and want to add to that position to bring your average price closer to the current price such that on a retrace you're likely to go in profit. Thats up to you to do. Every trader should determine what exit strategies and methods they're comfortable with and can use with their bank account. The problem is needing large bankrolls if it doesn't retrace. I also don't like the idea that you see that it's a losing trade yet the strategy involves adding more positions to predict a retracement. You're fighting the trend. I'd rather get out of the market to allow a new chart setup to materialize so that I can try to position myself in the trend again. If I know my trades are 70% accurate I'd rather bet on the next trade to double up since my system has no accuracy at predicting where the market will turn. It might be sooner than you think at waiting for 200 pips too. Say you waited 200 pips from 1.8800 and entered long at 1.9000 to exit at 1.9050. It hits a 100 SL at 1.8900. Most instances involve the turn in momentum to take place over time. There's a flat spot at the top of the chart showing resistance. So you enter a new order to enter a trade 200 pips from the high of that run. Most likely the original trade didn't turn against you as soon as it hit 1.9000. We'll say it ran to 1.9025. So if your trade gets stopped out you know the peak of that run was 1.9025 and to enter a sell order at 1.8825. When you get stopped out on the original trade price would have had to hit 1.8900 so you're only 75 pips away from entering the next trade to double up on. That shouldn't take very long to trigger. Yes this system does work for any price on a chart. Set a price, wait 200 pips, enter and TP 50. This is what the new posts to this thread are discussing right now. I first introduced the idea that waiting for new candles and resetting the system isn't necessary and could actually hurt this system. I'm trying to present the idea instead that we should take a simple look at a chart to use the highs and lows of the peak/valleys as our points to straddle. How many ranging markets or bad trades resulting from hitting S/R can we eliminate by not basing our positions on a time frame and more on the actual price of the market? You might have to work with the charts to accomplish 400 pips per month. That can be quite a lot of pips. Looking for more pips introduces more risk into the system. If I can get 150-250 pips a month to compound I'll be happy. Eventually by trading more lots I'll be able to get the same profit at 50 pips as I would trading a single lot for 100. That's up to you, again, to decide. I'll end by noting the idea of using the highs/lows of runs has a built in safety device. Most likely prices don't stall out on 1.9000 or 1.8400; even numbers. This means when we place our orders off of them it could automatically protect us from placing orders and SL's at levels that could get stop hunted. Whats 200 pips from 1.8847? 1.8647. Whats 150 pips from 1.8847? 1.8697. This gives us a little more peace of mind knowing it makes it easy for us to avoid being part of a typical trades mindset and entering trades at round numbers like 1.8650 or 1.8700. Matt

Here is an EA I had programmed. I have not done much with it yet and did not program it. In the distance field put the distance which is where the limit orders will be placed. When one is hit, the other is cancelled. The cancel at the end of day field is for daily charts so it will start over. Good luck. Matt

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Ok doke. I'm going to attach a picture below of how my new idea would play out. Since I was looking at 2 months of data, 7/11-9/11, I had to compress the chart. Therefore I couldn't put text on it. I'll explain by arrow colors. First yellow arrow - on this chart this would be the first level to base a trigger off of. Since this is a peak it means we base sell trigger off of this number. That would be 1.8476-200 = 1.8247 which is marked by the second yellow arrow and a TP 50 is marked by the bottom yellow arrow. If we played the trade perfectly we could have banked 92 pips if we let the trade run. (not worth it IMO compared to the potential los on other trades.) Green arrow marks the new low. This is where we base our buy trigger 200 pips from. 2nd arrow is the trigger, 3rd is the TP. As you can see the price continued upwards for another 150-200 pips. I've been trying to think of ways to trade continuing trends. Right now I'm looking at looking for the retrace to see where the new base forms. Use that as the new low to base the buy trigger off of. In this instance that point is marked by the white arrow at 1.8414. So the trigger is 1.8616. That continued uptrend did not reach that point so no trigger was hit and I would have cancelled it. Red arrow designates new high formed in that trend at 1.8597. Sell trigger is then shown by second red arrow at 1.8397. This trade would have ended in loss. That same candle to trigger the losing trade would later be our point to base our long trigger off of. The point was 1.8383 shown by turqoise arrow. Next turqoise arrow is the trigger and then the next is TP 50 point. The high off of that trend did not go down 200 pips to trigger anything. So we find the low to continue the trend. This is shown by the yellow arrow at 1.8543. Trigger at 1.8743 and TP at 1.8793. Uptrend continues, no sell triggers. Look for new low to base buy trigger. This point marked by green arrow at 1.8699. Trigger at 1.8899 with TP at 8949. I would not have made a new trade since the upmove was in only one candle and would be too volitile to judge. There was no new low to base a buy trigger off of. As time passes by on the chart you will place your triggers off of different points and change it accordingly. So the candle after the big run up formed a high for several candles. Then later a higher high was formed and that would be the new point to base the trigger off of. It was a high of 1.9144 designated by the white arrow. Trigger is 1.8944 with TP at 1.8894. This is where things get rough for the system. The market ranges drastically. It stays out for most of the time and then finally the moves are so violent that it allows a trigger to be hit. We base a long trigger off the low designated by the red arrow. Price is 1.8775, trigger is 1.8975 and TP 1.9025. As you can see the market hits our trigger and then reverses hard. Hindsight shows the market will range for quite a bit longer. So there is the 2nd losing trade. The next trade designated by the turqoise would have been a tough one that could have gone either way. The base was 1.8828, trigger 1.9028 and TP at 1.9078. The market went to 1.9027 and then dropped 131 pips. We would have narrowly missed a loss by 1 pip. This could have gone either way really. We lucked out in this situation. That would have been 2 losing trades in a row. This is why I say doubling up on trades may not be for everyone. To break even on the last 2 trades you'd need to put four times your usual size into the next play since you had doubled up on the last one as well. Anyways, next trade is profitable anyways. This is why I say I like the idea of doubling up on the next trade. If the system is very successful then I will trust eventually things will work out. It may be rough if you're unwisely using large lot sizes to play with for every trade. If you only use 2% per trade you would of had to use 4%, 8%, 16%, 32%, and 64% depending on if you lose that many in a row. I think this system is very unlikely to hit 5 trades in a row that lose. The next trade is shown by the yellow arrows. High is 1.9091. Trigger at 1.8891 and TP at 1.8841. SUCCESS! Last trade for this time period is the last set of green arrows. High of 1.8869 for a sell trigger at 1.8669 and TP at 1.8619. Another successful trade. The last white arrow is just showing the current point where we're basing our long trigger off of. Its the low of that valley. I like using this time period to show how survivable this system could be. We had a long period of ranging. This is a 2 hour chart. It ranged in the middle there for 18 days! That's a long time to be stuck in the same 150-200 pips. So lets look at the results. 9 winning trades versus 2 losing trades. For 2 months of time that equates to 350 pips profit or 175 pips a month. If you had tripled up on losers to breakeven on the loss as well as make 50 profit then it would have been like having 11 winning trades of 550 pips or 275 pips per month. The problem is if you were to get unlucky and had lost those two trades in a row where we luckily missed out by 1 pip. In that case you would have to triple up on your triple up to make those trades seem like profit, or 9 times your typical entry size to hope the third trade wins. I hope I've explained all of this clearly to everyone. I'll be backtesting further, but wanted to get a chart on here for people to see. Time to discuss. http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/8574/200piphh0.png

Just backtested 5/12 - 7/12 and it produced the following results. 13 wins with 2 losses. Both losses could have been nullified by doubling up on the next trade. So 550 pips profit for the 2 months. 275 a month. I'd take that. The beginning of the 5/12-7/12 chart was rough though. It ranged tremendously in a downward channel. The trades profited, but only by a few pips. Makes me wonder how much peace of mind it would give us to look for only 45 pips. It decreases our profits by 10% though. Up to each individual trader to determine if thats what they're willing to do. Even if you didn't double up on trades after losses then you would have still made 450 pips or 225 pips a month. Not bad. Might be something to start out on just to avoid the risks involved with doubling down. Since this is not an "always in" system it could be adapted to trade other pairs as well that could bring in profit. It literally takes a 1 minute look at a chart to set up all the trades. Matt P.S. - I've already edited this post 3 times to add more and more to it. Just thought all of you should know.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Well, maybe the trigger could be at the 150 pip point, or 170 just to give more room for the 50 TP. Are you using 100 for the SL?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I dont think the trigger should be moved to 150. Imagine how bad the system would have fallen apart during the extreme ranging in the chart I posted. TP was 50 and yes SL was 100 for those numbers. SL of 50 would get stopped out too often. I was hoping a lot of the trades would be able to be moved to TP 100 such that when you double up after a losing trade it makes it seem like the loser was actually a winner too. Asking for 100 is too much though apparently. I think I would say the 200 trigger filters out enough of the ranging market, but only leaves us with so much space to take profit. I'm happy with the results so far though. Matt

--- 帖子 #556 ---
August is the classic ranging (or stagnate) month. Apparently a lot of Europeans take vacations then. It was great for Firebird (a ranging EA) and pitiful for trending systems in general.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
That makes me feel better. If this trending strategy can come out on top during ranging months then I feel pretty good about it. What do you think? Am I missing something? Wish I was european to take vacations with them. Matt

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I agree. I am surprised it did that well in August. I am encouraged. By the way, I think your calc on profit was not quite right for the 7/11 to 9/11 period. You said you had 9 wins (50 pips) and 2 losses (100 ea?). So that would be 450 pips good and 200 bad for a total of 250 pips, or 125 pips per month. Not bad. I would trade for 125 pips per month as long as the drawdown was not too wild!

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I should have clarified. The results I give are if you double up after the loser. This is because I trust the system to be much more right than it is wrong. So when you double it up, instead of losing on one trade and winning on the next, -100 +50 = -50, it actually loses on one and wins double on the next, -100 + 100 = 0. So a losing trade just cancels out a winning trade. 11 trades - 9 wins, 2 losses. So the total profit is actually just like having only 7 wins. So 50 X 7 = 350 pips for the two months. 175 pips per month. Sorry I didn't clarify that earlier. For these months it would have produced 450-200 = 250 or 125 pips a month if you decided to not double up. Not as good, but not terrible for literally looking at a chart for maybe 2 minutes out of a day.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
OK. Thanks. Not bad for 2 or three minutes a day but one always must calculate the risk involved. Also, one must eventually calculate the time spent in endless study and analysis. Although that is the challenge!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Well there is always risk involved in trading. I think the risks are somewhat reduced since we're waiting on the sidelines for such a long time. I'm doing the study and analysis now. Once I get the balls to say it's good the way it is then it'll only take me 2-3 minutes to look at each day. I won't mind that. What should be noted is the 24 hours of mental anxiety watching as pips come and go. Some trades do take many hours to complete once triggered. Who's got the marbles to handle it? Matt

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I have found over the past few months that something will help here. DON'T Watch it! Once you have used your method to decide on your trade, set it in motion and DON'T Watch! I know. Easier said than done, but this has really helped me over the last few weeks. I think these breakout trades could end up being less stressful and more profitable than many other styles of trading.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Yea, I know watching it can be a pain in the butt and very nerve racking. It's what prevents a lot of people from going pro with trading. They just can't handle themselves. I've done some more backtesting. I assumed that the periods I was previously testing on were prime conditions for the system. (Even though we all know they weren't really.) So I tried to break the system. I set my chart to daily and backed it off so I could get the big picture of the last 2 years of trading. From what I saw, the period from February 1, 2006 to about April 15th, 2006 would be the absolute worst case scenerio for this trending/breakout system. It was ranging in between 1.7230 and 1.7630 at the extremes and included many smaller oscillations in between. There are other periods of ranging, such as from late August 2004 to mid-october 2004, but they wouldn't be as bad as the period I tested. You can clearly see in the 2004 period that it did have a pursuasion to the upside even while ranging. Anyways, what are the results for 2/1/2006-4/15/2006? It was rough. VERY ROUGH. You'll need some massive guts to be able to trade this system people. There were 16 trades made. 9 were winners and 7 were losers. Thats not the rough part. The rough part is that there was a losing streak of 3. This is why I want to explain my preference for doubling up on losing trades. If I had simply accepted the losses for losses and not doubled up my profits would be: 50 X 9 = 450. My losses would be: -100 X 7 = -700. So 450 + (-700) = -250. Now what happens when I double up on my trades after losses to overcome them? Well since I had consecutive losses, one win on the next trade after the 3 would make up for all 3 losses. So it wouldn't leave me with only 2 of the 9 trades profiting. The problem is we're risking quite a bit. Say we risk 2% of our account on a typical trade. We lose the first and double up on the second. Second loses and double up on the third. Third loses and double up on the fourth. Fourth wins. HOORAY. THANK YOU GOD! You would have risked the following amounts of your account on the trades. 2% - 4% - 8% - 16%. You can see whats happening. Do you have the guts to do that? What does this do for our profits though? Well because we're only doubling up and are trying to breakeven on the losses it doesn't add any profits when we finally win after the losses. It does get rid of the -250 pip loss though. I'm happy about that. So if you had doubled up after each loss, including the consecutive losses, you would have made 200 pips in profit for the 2.5 months. Theres a big difference between +200 and -250, wouldn't you say? This just gives me more confidence in trading this type of system. This was obviously a terrible situation for the system, but through wise money management you can easily turn a bad situation into a good one. I would not expect this system to have more than 4 consecutive losses in a row. Even if the system had 2 sets of 3 consecutive losses in a month it would be able to survive them so long as there was a win in between them to bring your account back to even. Anyways, I thought I'd post all of that for you to show that this system can perhaps survive even the toughest trading scenerios. I didnt want to be looking through rose colored glasses considering the great trading gbp/usd has been having this last month or two. Please, I encourage you all to manually backtest this and demo forward test before trying it live. I would really appreciate as much criticism, opinions, or tips. I'll be testing more periods to see if I was wrong in thinking I had found the worst case scenerio. Matt

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Backtest results for period 11/24/2004 - 1/6/-2005. 11 trades. 9 wins - 2 losses. Doubling up after losers would have given you a total profit of 350 pips on the strategy. Not doubling up would have profited 250. Matt

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Ok, my post about averaging I was really being sarcastic I suppose. Maybe I am not understanding you. How are you backtesting without a set time to begin for the wait? Not having a begin time is the only issue I have, so what time did you use in backtesting?

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Just a simple thought. It might help if you just used historic S/R horizontals of the daily &amp; weekly charts &amp; don't overlook the previous weeks high &amp; low as these also represent S/R. BabeFX

--- 帖子 #567 ---
When you say "time to beging for the wait," do you mean when do I know where to look for the 200 pip move? Simple. To trade this method I'm looking at a 2 hour chart. This way I can see all the intraday movement and would know if my trade would have gotten stopped out. Finding the points to base the triggers off of is easy. Simply find the peaks and valleys. If you look at the chart I posted it should be clear. Take a look at the first set of green arrows. This was a new low formed on the chart. You only base buy triggers off of lows and you only base sell triggers off of highs. Then just follow the price adjusting the triggers as new highs and lows are formed. Again, I'm looking at a 2 hour chart. Hope this helps. Matt

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Not sure what you mean. How would you use the previous weeks highs/lows? Would you not make some trades because of it? The problem I have with using S/R from past periods is we get caught up trying to figure out how far back do we go? Besides, the method already has incorporated those levels in previous trades. If the previous low was in fact a substantial low that price bounced off of then a trade was probably triggered from it as price rose 200 pips from it. Would you mind giving an example of how your idea would play out in a trade so I can understand you better? Matt

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hello all, I've done more backtesting. Turns out I didn't find the worst case scenerio. The period for this backtesting is from 11/1/2005 - 1/31/2006, about 3 months. There were 20 trades. Although after looking at the period I have come up with a new rule. One of the trades I would have entered was a trend continuation where there was a severe drop to close one of the trades in profit. There was then a spinning top candle and then another severe drop in price in the next candle. I took the high off the spinning top to base my 200 pip sell trigger off of. It ended in a losing trade. In my opinion this could have been avoided if I had waited for there to be more of a retrace and some base formed after the first significant drop. The drop could be said to still be too quick to say a high was formed to base the trigger off of. That doesn't affect the results though since my results are using a doubling down strategy after losers. It would have mattered if the next trade was a winner, but it wasn't. In fact the next two trades were losers. Including the first trade I now would not take, there would have been 20 trades. 12 winners, 8 losers. There were two sets of consecutive losers. The first was the one I mentioned just now where there were 3 in a row;2 if we now don't take that first trade. The second set was 4 losing trades. FOUR! Ouch. 2% - 4% - 8% - 16% - 32% risked on the doubling up trades with the 32% winning. When you get periods of time like this you almost want the losers to be in a row. This is because using this risky doubling down strategy you cover your losses with only one win. If the losers were not consecutive then you would be using one winner per loser to breakeven on the losses. So 12 wins - 8 losses = -200 without utilizing a double down strategy. -100 if you didn't take the first trade. Using a doubling down on losers strategy you would be +450 for the 3 months. It seems this strategy seems to be averaging anywhere from 125-400 pips a month. I'm backtesting under absolute terrible trading conditions of the tightest ranges. I'm thinking though, that it is nearly almost absolutely profitable only because of the risks involved with doubling down. Without doubling down this strategy would produce several periods of losses. Possible ideas to prevent yourself from having to produce 4 losses in a row would be to expand the trigger to 300 pips so that price is most likely moving out of the range it's currently in. It brings up the idea though, does it matter how good the system is if we're willing to risk our money in certain money management strategies? I still like this system just because it is so easy to use and requires so little time. Results like these do have me thinking though. Is it the system or the doubling down strategy? I like to think it has a little to do with the system since even in severe ranging periods there are more winners than losers. What is everyones opinion? Is it just the doubling down or a combination of the system and doubling down that is making this profitable, even in rough scenerios? Matt

--- 帖子 #570 ---
More back test results. This time in a period not necessarily ranging. 4/10/2005 - 6/30/2005. 17 trade - 13 winners, 4 losers. None of the losers were consecutive. Total profit if doubling down - +450 or about 225 a month Total profit if not doubling down - +250 or about 125 a month. Just trying to show a better picture now after demonstrating the rough periods. 225 a month isn't so bad.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Who cares about pips? Pips are unimportant. The most important question is: What is your ROI (= Return On Investment ) in percent each month? I assume your ROI is lousy.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I was looking as far back as 1990 to determine weekly levels, and yes I would agree that it becomes a bit of a lottery deciding which levels to use. I will proceed down this avenue of approach until I have reached a conclusion. BabeFX.

Drop the crap, place B/S OCO orders at previous session H/L away you go. Just got to add a buffer &amp; work out the stops. BabeFX.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
can you please explain you strategy in detail please Thanks

--- 帖子 #575 ---
B/S = Buy/Sell OCO = One cancels other (order) H/L = High/Low (refers to previous session posted high/low) Buffer = leeway on entry, pip value away from actual H/L Stop = Amount of money you are prepared to risk before you accept you are wrong. Hope that is enough. BabeFX.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Yeah, I think we know all of those definitions Babe. We wanted some of the details behind your comment of "drop the crap". We are trying to use historical data to work out those details of the amount of buffer, amount of stop, amount of take profit, to maximaize the return over time.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Then how would you determine the ROI and increase it? I think you're saying the strategy isn't worth it because it requires strict money management that limits you to how much you can put towards a trade. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not trading for next month or even next year. Trading should be a long term goal if you ever plan on making it a full time ordeal. Sure, I could probably get a great ROI if I gamble that I'll have a good month with the system. Hell, so far backtesting shows it always wins more than it loses. But then what happens when I hit those consecutive losses? My account has to be able to handle it. I've shown that with sound money management the strategy of doubling down gives us profits in even the worst situations. You take the bad with the good. Sometimes you have 100 pips months, sometimes you have 400 pip months. I like the idea because my bad months are still positive months and not -200 pips. This way I know I can just keep putting money into the system. Compound, compound, compound. The ROI will eventually make it worth it. Feel free to tell me why you think ROI is going to suck. Matt

--- 帖子 #578 ---
That was somewhat the original idea of the thread. Instead of previous session highs and lows we used the open price. Some have profited off of this strategy. What I didn't like was the system resests itself only because of time and a new candle forming. My idea right now is to disregard time and only play off of the highs and lows of the runs we see on intraday charts. If the low of a run was 1.9600 than play the breakout when it rises 200 pips even if thats 2 or 3 days down the road. Whats your opinion on that instead of resetting the system for each new session? Also, I'm not so sure your strategy would work in theory. If you place a trigger so many pips away from the highs and lows from a previous session it will be hard to determine the buffer for each session. There will be candles that close near their high and then there will be candles that have closed 40 pips away from the high. So a sell trigger should not be based off of the high because the next candle could be only 5 pips away and create a triger off of a weak trend. The only way to use that idea, IMO, would be to base buy triggers off of highs and sell triggers off of lows. This again has the problem of resetting itself after each candle though. The price could move in a strong, predictable downtrend but stay inside the buffer you've created from the highs and lows. It could maybe only move down 40 pips a day and your trigger is at 50 pips. No trade this candle. It does the same thing next candle and doesn't trigger again. The price has moved 80 pips, but no trigger hit. That's why I say we should eliminate time from the equation and play the highs and lows of the trends instead of resetting the system after each candle. Matt

I am looking at a couple of ideas, trying to get it all down on paper. I have spent a great deal of time &amp; effort in the past looking at various breakout methods. One of the methods is an adaptation of a strategy I picked up from reading "The Logical Trader". I will be in a position to present some results ( I hope ) in the not to distant future. BabeFX.

The ROI of a martingale is always lousy and sucks. You want to risk 1-3-9-27 just to win 1 ?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
It's not technically martingale. Martingale is when you add to your already losing position and expect price to turn. Your lowering/raising your average price so it's easier to make a profit on the retrace that you are hoping for. My strategy involves exiting the market to double up on the next trade knowing that my strategy is more than 50% correct. I'd rather give myself a shot at being right on another trade rather than try to turn a losing trade around. For a 100 SL and 50 TP I would need to triple up on the investment to make it seem as if I was profiting even in the losing trades. I'm only looking to break even right now so my losers don't eat into my profits. So really my risk would be 1-2-4-8 to break even on the losing trades. It's not to win just one either. If on a 3 consecutive loss series where I would risk 1-2-4 and then win on the fourth trade I would actually be winning 6. (-100) + (-100) + (-100) = -300. To break even I'd need to win 6 trades that profit +50 pips each. So in one trade I'm really winning 6 trades. Like I said, this strategy isn't for everyone and will not survive if you're not managing your money correctly. This is where a highly leveraged account can be a plus. With less margin required you can put more trades towards a certain goal. If you know your strategy is more than 50% successful then you can rest assured that eventually you'll be at breakeven, if not profit. Eventually when my account grows large enough I will triple up on each losing trade to make it 1-3-9-27. Those are lot sizes, not percentage of account. This way when I know I'll be winning eventually then it'll be like profiting on every trade. 20 trades in 2 months = 300 pips a month irregardless if 5 or 6 of those 20 are losers. A large account will be necessary for this. Anyways, ROI. Even if the strategy only gives you 100 pips a month it is still a good ROI when compared to typical investments. If you put 2% of your account towards each trade then 100 pips a month is 2% ROI I believe; 24% in a year. There aren't many investments offering that kind of ROI. I've already shown that 100 pips a month seems to be a lowball number for when the market isn't trending well. Is there something I'm missing? Matt

Hardly into testing Previous week H/L breakouts to realise that there are not enough breaks to make a profitable strategy. Still working on other strategy. BabeFX.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Wouldn't that be (-100) + (-200) + (-400) on three losing trades? If you are doubling up, you need to keep doubling up your loses too. You'd also have to go for the same profit/loss targets, at a bare minimum.. If you are onto your fourth loss, and you do "win", you would have gained 50 pips x 8, or 400 total pips. By this time, you have lost 700 pips. A very high risk way of trading. Even if you have a strategy that is 100tp/100sl, and wins 55% of the time. Who says you can't lose 10 times in a row? It is _unlikely_, but it is _possible_. I use to use the same concept while playing Black Jack. As I lost, double the bet. You'd think you couldn't lose more than 5 or 6 times in a row. It happens all the time though. The better way to play Black Jack is to do progressive winning. As you win, every other time, increase your bet. 1 1, 2 2, 4 4, etc... Would I ever use this method in trading? Never. Take the bumps with the bruises.... Once a trade takes profit or a loss, that trade is done, onto the next one... That is where your money management comes into play. As long as your risk to reward ratio is good (1.5 at least, better in the 2.0 or 3.0 range), then it doesn't really matter what happened the last trade. I personally watched this thread much closer in the beginning. The original methods posted do work (I personally like the 20/-20 straddle of London open). Sure, they have their bad days, but they have good days in return. Lately, too many untested _theories_ have been thrown out, many off track from a "daily break-out" approach... Be nice to see the thread get back on that track daily break-out strategies.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
You are correct. Can't believe I was so stupid. I was concentrating so much on the last loss that I forgot about incorporating the previous losses as well. Sometimes a little common sense can go a long way. The steps per losing trade would then actually require the risk per trade to be: 1 - 2 - 6- 18 - 27 - 54 - 108 - 216. It starts doubling after 27. That is to just breakeven when using a 100 SL and 50 TP. Thanks for essentially slapping me in the face though. I needed that. Here I was thinking everything was as simple as that, but I had forgotten the most important piece of the puzzle. I will state though. Is trading this way still possible? Yes, very much so. It depends on how much you trade with. If you trade 1 standard lot per typical trade you better have at least $500,000 in your account if you expect to lose up to 8 times in a row and still have a chance. Like I've said though, with proper money management it's possible. Even if it means starting with an account that is .01 per pip, then do it to make sure you're safe if you use this strategy. High leverage also helps out in this situation to keep margin calls down. You just have to be smart with it. Are 8 losing trades in a row possible? Very much so. What are the chances though? Should we be so afraid of such a chance? If a system is even just 50% successful what are the chances of 8 trades in a row losing? If I remember my college classes correctly, although the chance of the trade losing is 50% on each trade independently, once we try to string them together the chance of such an occurance actually becomes the following: .5 X .5 X .5 X .5 X .5 X .5 X .5 X .5 = .00390625. Correct me if I'm wrong. The chance of 8 losing trades in a row on a 50% system is just .3%. If I think the system is 60% successful, or 40% wrong, the chances of consecutive losing trades is: 2- .16 3- .064 4- .0256 5- .01024 6- .004096 7- .0016384 8- A really small number. So thats why I think the strategy is still viable. With good money management, i.e. - not using lots too large for your account, you can still survive a string of many losses. After 5 losses you can see just how unlikely that gets to be. Are you afraid of losing 100 trades in a row just like you are of losing 2? No, because losing 100 in a row is severely unlikely. Even if you were trying to be wrong you'd still probably win since the market wouldn't let you be 100% right about being wrong. (LOL) ANYWAYS - To get off that since you just woke me from my disillusionment, although its still possible, I would like to still challenge the idea that we don't need to look at time frames for our trigger points. I gave the example from before that when we reset the time frame and our points we miss out on the consistent movement. I dont know. A lots going through my head now. Kinda depressed I was so stupid to think it was that simple to overcome losses. Oiy. Matt

I quote this part to ask the question; was it using the opening price that made the system successful or the straddle? Why can't we straddle from any point in time to take profit?

Just letting you all know I've started a new thread titled Probability System Theory and Money Management discussing the topic of doubling down after losing trades and probabilities of consecutive losers. Just as DavidH mentioned, it was a little off topic. I'd still like to talk about the random entry idea on here though. Matt

Hi Traderone, I'm just wondering how your Karamba system has been doing until now? Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Karamba had a bad week. One day was a winner for 25 +50. But two other days were losers at -40 and -40. I didn't trade on Friday (NFP). So for the week, -85 pips. I think for the last 4 weeks the total would be around a positive 210 pips. I am not around my trading machine right now but will be glad to post the statement later. (My version of Micardo was postitive however.)

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi traderone, I just want to clarify your modified system, it looks good and i'm going ot give it a shot, Pound, example, price at open is 1.9150 we put a buy order at 1.9204 and a sell order at 1.9110. Which broker are you using for this method? Thanks

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Traderone, Thanks for the Karama results. Is Mircado manual or with an EA? and if with an EA can you post the one you are using. Thanks, Eric

The idea of going off the Londen open is because that is the first "major" movement of the trading session after the NY session closes. There is some movement with Asia open, but the bigger movements happen shortly after London open. Hence the orginal concepts presented. Is it possible to just pick some random point and enter? Sure, depends on what you are willing to risk, I guess. I guess without any way to show a system like that works, it is tough to say. You can always curve fit a system like that (any system), it would really depend forward testing in a demo account. With the above London open idea, you can go back everyday to check it out. I think the bigger picture is is that you have to come up with yourself, or follow a system exactly as presented. If you get off track with a system, then you are not giving the original system its fair chance. I don't trade forex all that much, I don't like the spreads . I trade futures mostly, which you pay commissions on (less than 1/2 pip value). The futures move in the same fashion as forex does (EURUSD for Forex, Euro FX for Futures). David

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Yea, those would be the numbers more in line. That would be just to break even on your first lost. Then you need to win two times in a row to make money eventually. ie: loss loss loss win (your at break even) loss win (back to break even) win (made profit) This would take a huge account just to break-even. Your initial trade can't be your typical 1% - 3% of your account, that is for sure. 2 or 3 loses in a row, you just put a large chunk of your account at risk. If you happen to have 6 loses loses in a row, you can't go any further as you are over the 100% mark. Trading a system like this to make under 1% of your account is where the ROI comes into play that was mentioned earlier. Is it worth the possible risk for such a small ROI? Dunno, that is up to the individual trader I guess. This would break most money management theories/ideas, but it comes back to what risk the trader is willing to assume while trading. David

I don't use an EA with any of these daily strategies. It only takes about 10 minutes to set up the orders for both the Karamba and the Micardo methods. And frankly, I am also paying attention to the Fozzy on 4 major pairs. This is an attractive way to trade timewise and I think probably profit wise also. Frankly I lost my *&amp;% on the Firebird EAs recently and I am now manually trading and studying daily methodologies.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
A little adaptation to the Daily Strategy that this thread has been discussing. It does require an account that allows hedging (I use interbankfx). At 00:00 GMT buy and sell the EUR/USD with a 50 pip stop loss and 15 trailing stop. Close out all open orders between 23:30 and 24:00 GMT. The premise of this trade is to capitalize on the interday price activity. If you look at a candle chart most days will have shadows of at least 17 pips on the bottom if an up day and on the top if a down day. In these cases you'll have a profitable trade on BOTH trades. However, days when there are shawdows of less than 17 pips you lose (most of the times it is the whole 50 but somedays it will only be in the 30-40 range). You will incur some days of losing 50 pips but the gains definitely offset those times. Here are the results from April to October: April +458 May +184 June -3 July +333 August +573 September -35 October +140 Total Gain +1650 I'm currently running Novembers numbers. As for December it is currently up +175 pips. Q

I have spent the last 3 days testing weekly breakout strategies. I will have to go through the tests again next week end to double check &amp; fine tune stops &amp; take profit targets. One of the strategies would appear to give 41 winning trades out of a total of 49 with a R/R ratio in the order of 1:2 , this appears to good to be true. BabeFX

Very interesting. My broker doesn't allow hedging. Although you do bring up an interesting idea. "Let runners run, cut the legs of losers..." etc etc. Maybe we should have only looked for an efficient trigger and SL and not a TP? Just let the buggers run, ya know? Have a 30-40 pip trigger then have a 30-40 pip trailing SL or so. We've already done the research to show waiting 30-40 pips eliminates a lot of the losers. Has anyone heard of a progressive trailing stop loss? Does one exist? I'm not a country boy, but I've been bored enough to watch tractor pulls on ESPN every once in a while. If you've ever seen one then you know what I'm about to describe. The tractor is hitched to a load which either shifts weight or something that makes it harder and harder for the tractor to pull it. So it's really easy for the tractor to pull and then when it gets to around 300 ft down the track its almost impossible even for a 2000 HP tractor to pull it. The idea for the SL would be then be that as price moves in a favorable direction it becomes harder and hard for it to not get stopped out. We want those profits locked in. The SL would eventually get very tight once we're 100 pips or more in profit and the only way for it to not get stopped out is if momentum kept going. I'll probably have to explain it again, but let me know if anyone knows of something similar to this that is already out there. Matt

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Interesting idea. I have played with varoius hedging options, but never found a decent one. Be interesting to see some screen caps of this. When does your trailing stop kick in? After 15 pips of movement? ie: if your long moves up 15 pips, then your SL is moved to -35? Your short remains at -50. Is that correct? David

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi qmg, Nice trades there, im wondering if you get a chance if you could post what other rules you followed to get that amount of pips for those months, like where your tp was etc, trailing stops, or however you dealt with the tp etc. Thnks

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hi QMG, Thanks for sharing your idea. Very interesting. My question is if you have tested on other pairs, like GBP. I know it gives more volitily and hence potentially more profit/risk. Will be testing your method. Thanks. AndyL

--- 帖子 #602 ---
QMG, I'm afraid this won't work in reality (forward trading) because the trailing stops don't work that way. What you are doing is setting the stop to BE when the trade is 15 pips up and calling it a trailing stop.. In reality, a trailing stop of 15 would begin when the trade reaches 15 pips in the correct direction and begins to pull the stop loss along with it. So, the trade could easily go the 17 pips you mentioned, then reverse the other direction and still lose 48 pips (stop was pulled along 2 pips), not be stopped for a small gain. I think over time in forward trading the spreads would simply eat all profits. I have been looking for YEARS for an effective way to hedge trades and still make some sort of profit. Still haven't found it.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Yes, this is the old hedge hog revisited. The problem is the draw down when you do get stung by the stop losses. Just do a search for Hedge Hog and you will see what this is...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Actually, it's "averaging down", suprisingly it increases profit factor. Martingale is doubling bet size after a loss - quick way to go bust

Hi guys (and girls if any) I've just glanced through that trade and can't find 1 thing I want the most: example trades executed according to the first post. I wrote an EA and on 5 years data it sucks very badly indeed :-/ At the moment I have optimilzation going on and I see it can be profitable but expected payoff is about 2-3 pips, which means the strategy is very sensitive to slippage and spread. If someone is trading this strategy as explained in post 1, could you please show a few consecutive days of trades with daily open, triggers, stops, tps and end day result? If it is indeed profitable then apparently there is something wrong with my backtesting and comparing trades could clarify things. Thank you, Lw

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Assuming your above scenario--lets say the price started at 1.3200 and moved up to 1.3217 and reversed 48 pips to 1.3169. Based upon my "system/theory" you would make 2 pips on the BUY side and have 14 pips "locked in" on the SELL side. If the market when back to the open price the sell order would get stopped out at 1.3284 This works because Interbankfx allows you to take both positions at 1.3200 with a 15 pip trailing stop. On interbankfx the trailing stop is a true trailing stop (unlike fxcm ) that locks in the profit once the price has moved 15 pips and then moves pip for pip after that, e.g. moves the the stop loss to break even once the 15 pip trailing stop is achieved. Q

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi OMG, The worst case I see on this is if price goes to 16 and then reverses, so you get one pip, then it goes the other way to say at the most -15 and then reverses again and goes positive to +50. This will cause a loss of -50 +1 = -49 pips. As far as I can tell, that is the worst case scenario. Is that about the way you see this?

--- 帖子 #608 ---
AH Hah!!! So, the IBFX trailing stop works to set the trade to breakeven at the specified pips? I thought that only started to pull the stop along at that time. So , I will give this a shot tonite.... right now. Interesting if it really works this way.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Ibfx policy

--- 帖子 #610 ---
thanks. I've been trading live with them for a year I guess it is about time I should learn how THEIR trailing stop works as opposed to FX C M who I formerly used.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
For the most part, yes...you have to factor in the 2 pip spread. Everyday there will be a winning trade...somedays two but never none. Even days that have a 50 pip losing side there is a winning side as well (sometimes it will cancel each other out, sometimes only a few pips...) Q

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Rules again: BUY and SELL the EUR/USD at 0:00 GMT Set a 15 pip Trailing Stop Set a 50 pip Stop Loss Its rather simple...You are trying to profit on the fact that on most days the market will range up and down at least 17 pips from the 0:00 GMT open. Q

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I wonder if it would really make any difference on the start time? Seems that when one system of trades is complete you could just start up again. Morning, noon or night the market will move somewhere.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
So, if you get a spike up or down for say 80 pips, the idea is you get stopped out for -50, and then profit on the other trade? Was the SL of 50 a number that was tested? Vs using a SL of say 40 or 60? David

--- 帖子 #615 ---
The only reason I picked 0:00 GMT is that it gave me a reliable way to back test using daily numbers and the charts. But I like your idea that once a trade is done to enter another one...will have to give that some more thought. Q

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Yes, however, be careful because there isn't a pip for pip correlation. With the tight Trailing Stop of only 15 pips you can be stopped out well before realizing the 80 pip gain. In a steady, straight forward market it works like that but when its choppy you get stopped out quite often during a 30 minute candle because of the price movement therein. Earlier in this thread you will find discussion re: the 50 pip SL. From my memory it seems that once the price has moved that far the chance of it retracing back to the other side of the open is drastically reduced. It is a money management thing. Q

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi QMG, Sorry to ask obvious questions but 1) is your TP 17 pips higher/lower on the 00:00 GMT close or open? 2) Do you put the order in at 00:00 GMT? 3) it seems that by looking on the charts that the 12th you would have made money maybe even more than once as indicated in previous post. maybe you can give here your exact order for today (12th). Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Answers: 1) The TP is 15 pips (on interbankfx there is a 2 pip spread that I factor in) 2) I don't put an order in I BUY and SELL the pair. This isn't an entry order trade. You BUY the pair and then SELL the pair. Interbankfx and some others allow you to hold both. 3) Today's price at 0:00 GMT was 1.3281. In my accout I bought the EUR/USD and then immediately after I sold the EUR/USD--both with 15 Trailing Stops and a Stop Loss of 50. Currently, I'm up 5 pips on the BUY and down 5 on the SELL. Q

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Thank you. I will go to the interbankfx website as well to read up on this option. btw, I would have imagined that today it would have hit TP, maybe I should go back to the chart again. Thanks, Eric

--- 帖子 #620 ---
He doesn't have an actual TP. The profit is based on the trailing stop. The example of 17 PIPs was just an example, not an actual TP level. Basically, you are in the trade until your SL or trailing stop are hit. David

--- 帖子 #621 ---
So the pair was bought and sold at the 00:00 gmt price and then just let it basically go. Thanks for the additional explanation. I still don't know why you could not do this on with any broker, is it the trailing stop that works different? Regards, Eric sn

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Most brokers don't let you buy and sell the same pair (ie: hedge/go both ways). Then, on some, like FXCM , they don't trail the same. On IBFX, if you have a 15 PIP trailing stop, at a +15 PIPs, your stop would be moved to 0. If you are +16 PIPs, then the SL is moved to +1. If you move +50, then your SL is set to +35. At least that is my understanding. Am playing around with this in a demo at IBFX. David

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Funny thing...soon as i got out of FXCM i start making money... Got myself a new broker who let me hedge and have REAL trailing stop....unlike u know who (other broker)!

--- 帖子 #624 ---
OK. Last night first attempt at the QMT trade method. EURUSD sell ..... Break Even EURUSD buy ...... -50 Ouch. Will try again at 0:00 GMT again today.

I am sorry to ask one stupid question: Let me say I buy EURUSD at 1.3000, stoploss 50pips@1.2950. Trailing stop 15pips. If price go up for 20 pips,now 1.3020. The stoploss now is 1.3000(breakeven) or 1.2965 or maybe somewhere else? It seems IBFX move stoploss to 1.3000(breakeven). But most other brokers move stoploss to 1.2965. Anyone knows which broker works like IBFX?They are our gold mine. Broker use different Trailing mothed.If i am wrong,please correct me. Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
With Interbankfx your new stop loss with the above scenario would be at 1.3005 and will move pip for pip upward so if the price moves another 5 pips up the stop loss trail behind by 15 (price at 1.3025 stop loss would be 1.3010). Hope this helps. I've been very pleased with interbankfx and their customer support especially when I was trying to get a handle on their trailing stops. I came from the fxcm world and had that concept of trailing stops in my mind--this is totally different and I like it becaues it locks profit in pip for pip once triggered. Q

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Tonights order: BUY and SELL at 1.3215 50 pip SL 15 Trailing Stop Since there is really no big news event until Friday's CPI number I expect a "choppy" market which is perfect for this type of trading. Tonight I'm going to go back and check to see if we moved the Trailing Stop to 20 pips what the results would be. It may lock in more profit due to the fact that sometimes during a 30 minute candle there is more than 15 pip movement even when its trending in one direction or it may increase more losing days because the market turns between 15 and 20 so we would miss out on those 2-5 pip gains...I'll let you all know... Q

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Did you notice a lot of 2-5 pip wins in your previous test? Maybe that would save some time.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
That was actually going to be my first check--great minds must think alike Also, so far the GBP/USD looks to be fairly effective as well, even with the 3 pip spread on interbankfx making a 18 pip swing necessary. Q

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Having done a first stage look at the GBP/USD the strategy seems to be profitable atleast when it comes in comparisons to the EUR. April to October the EUR/USD had 58 days when it lost one of the sides. During the same period the GBP/USD lost on 54 days. Tomorrow I'm going to go back and manually look at the charts candle by candle and get the total pippage. My guess will be that it is slightly above what the EUR brought in. Q P.S. I did try the GBP/USD tonight on my interbankfx account. Will post results tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Thanks for your efforts here QMG. On my IBFX live account it looks like the spread is most often 4 pips on GBPUSD. That's why I was thinking about USDJPY. Or maybe even something like AUSUSD since that pair doesn't seem to pay that much attention to Europe. Looking forward to your results.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
That extra pip most likely won't make a difference since historically the trades have been executed during low volatility and a 3 pip spread. Even with 4 I think we'll be okay.

For last night on EURUSD I had this: Buy trade +25 Sell trade +11 Total +36

Word of caution to all: Last night on Interbankfx my orders weren't executed for some reason. My computer was on and internet connected but for some reason the trades didn't happen. I did contact interbankfx and have an e-mail to their reconciliation guy. I'll let you know what happens. I do know that if your computer is off or you lose internet the trailing stops aren't activated because they aren't stored on interbankfx's server but rather your pc. Only thing I can think of is that last night interbankfx sent my pc a "ping" that wasn't received. I think that is because my computer went into safe mode after x amount of time of inactivity. I might have to adjust that...anyone know if there is a way to turn that feature of the pc off?

I've tested the strategy today. However, it happened to be on loss position as market initial moved up to 50pips. Once it reach the point, it moved down to 130pips. Appreciate your comment.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
(When I state times I'm referencing the 5 minute candle using the charts on interbankfx) I'm curious as to your numbers. The 0:00 GMT price for the EUR/USD was 1.3215 (cost you 1.3217 to BUY using a 2 pip spread). At 7:40 GMT the price hit 1.3232 thus triggering the 15 Trailing Stop...At 8:05 GMT it reached 1.3252 locking in the 20 pip profit because it went down after 8:05 GMT. You would have been stopped out at 8:15 GMT at 1.3237. On the sell side the 0:00 GMT price was 1.3215. Since the 50 pip Stop Loss wasn't reached earlier the trade was still active when the price dropped later in the morning. At 11:30 GMT the price hit 1.3195 triggering the Trailing Stop and locking in 3 pips. At 11:55 GMT the price dropped to 1.3182 and locked in 16 pips profit...unfortunately the price then moved back up exactly 15 pips to 1.3197 thus closing out the trade at a profit of 16 (I say unfortunately because immediately after the price headed down 1.3162 at 13:30 GMT--would have profited another 20 pips) That is how my numbers look for the day but like I said earlier this is just paper today because interbankfx didn't trigger my trailing stops during the night but I think I have a way around it. When my monitor goes into safe mode the cpu also does which in essence is like shutting it down, atleast when it comes to interbankfx. I'm going to turn off the "safe mode" feature for the monitor, physically turn it off before bed and then let my cpu run throughout the night. That should solve the problem. Q

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I just leave my machine up and running all night. Had too many problems with the CPU going dormant etc. (Hell, who am I kidding? I have two machines on 24/7 running at least 15 various accounts in demo and 2 accounts "live") I jumped the gun a little on last night's trade. Got in at 22:46 IBFX time (5:46PM EST). The buy was at 1.3212 and the sell was at 1.3210. I had somewhere to be at 00:00 GMT! Worked anyway. I was thinking about also doing this at 5 PM EST which is when I get a new daily bar on FXDD. Just to see what kind of difference there may be. I know I will be demo playing this on three pair for the next few weeks. EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Don, Let me know how it works with the JPY, my initial look of it doesn't look too good since it seems to pick a direction and go with it. I'd be interested in your testing. I'm comfortable with the EUR and GBP since I know them best and have confidence in their price movement. Q

To anybody wanting to try this strategy using Interbankfx make sure your computer system doesn't go into hibernation. To turn off your hibernation mode right click on your start up screen, go to properties, on the screen saver tab towards the bottom you'll see a Power...button, click on that button which will bring you to the power schemes page. Make sure all options, especially "turn off hard disks", system standby, and system hibernates are switched to "NEVER". By doing this your Trailing Stops will be active with interbank. Last night my computer went into hibernation and my Trailing Stops weren't activated because as far as Interbankfx is concerned, and their servers, my computer was off. They don't store the Trailing Stops on their server but go off of yours. Fortunately, I was able to break even for the day and not lose anything. Unfortunately I left 86 pips on the table A lesson well learned!!! Hope this helps... Q

Market was very active at 0:00 GMT so my enteries have a few pips of variance.

Just finished caculating November's results for the EUR/USD and the results aren't pretty... -71 pips The last four days had four -50 pip days which kind of makes sense since we were, and still are, flirting with some historic levels. I'm going to work on the GBP/USD numbers now... Q

I think we should close this threat because the original system develpoer doesnt post anymore like MICARDO and Markj so , I dont understand anymore about what strategy is been talking, maybe we should redirect this threat to the 2 original ideas ones of MICARDO and the other Mark j if not maybe this strategies is over

I think the thread is still valid. It's got a lot of useful information. It's still withing the realm of a "daily range strategy". Why close it? It's not too hard to understand.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I am still running test accounts on the Micardo style and on my modified Kamanda style. Last week was tough, but about breakeven for Micardo and the previous 3 weeks were wildly successful. Here is an idea I am playing with and will be backtesting this weekend. At 5 PM EST (00:00 on FXDD) open a trade in the direction of the previous day's candle. Set TP for 40 and SL for 20. If trade is not closed by 15:00 GMT then close it. From Nov 13 to Dec 8 this did 161 pips. I will be analyzing precious months and also playing with SL and TP settings.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Don, thank you for your contribution, and please do keep us updated in your testing of the above strategy. It is very interesting. If you open a new thread with that strategy please let us know where we can find it. Thanks again, Don. grace and truth, Mike

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Don, I was considering this a while back but never went any further into it. I think the optimon stop is 40, with take profit at 50. Only trade the way of the previous days candle. Will be very interested to see how you get on with this.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I know it seems wildly simplistic, but often, even when the new day bar ends up with a different color, the trade will win before going the other way. I lost all 5 days in one week, and in another week I won all five days, with the other weeks a mixed bag of around 50%. Not all winning trades got the whole 40 pips. Markj, I'll also study your suggestions for SL and TP.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
can someone out there do me a BIG favor, i need someone to backtest a promissing trading system for me. the system is a 10 pip straddle system. put a 10 pip straddle in at london open with a 25 pip sl and a 50 pip target all trades run until sl or target is hit DO NOT ADD ANY SPREAD. if you can do this please try and go back as far a possible at least a year or more. i have been playing system live for one month now and results are VERY good. sincereley: MR.

These results are for the hedging at 0:00 GMT part of this thread... EUR/USD BUY +10 SELL +13 (technically I believe it should be 15 pips but I wasn't able to get in exactly at the 0:00 GMT) GBP/USD BUY +30 SELL -50 The GBP/USD would have been very profitable for the day but it hit the SELL stop loss and then wouldn't you know turned the other directions within minutes...oh well...still up for the day TOTAL: +3 Q

--- 帖子 #652 ---
OMG, I am not endorsing your idea here, because I have not studied it enough, but would you have been stopped out of GBPUSD if you had adjusted your SL and you TS to be perportional to the Daily Range? In other words, if EURUSD is 15 and 50 and we know that GBPUSD is at least 130% the range size of EURUSD, that would give a set of numbers like 20 ts and 65 sl... I do not think this would have been stopped out and it matches the range of the currency better. What are your thoughts on it?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Interesting thought about increasing the SL proportionately because of the greater Daily Range...I can do a quick back test through my notes and see what effect that would have had. My initial thought is that it won't have much because even though the GBP/USD has a greater daily range the number of times it travels +50 in one direction and then retraces back across the open price is very rare. In my back testing the majority of loses occur when the price fluctuate during the Asian market 0-10 pips then picks a direction at Europe (Frankfurt and London) open and goes that way into NY open.

Results for the last couple days: 12/18 EUR/USD Buy +10 Sell +13 GBP/USD Buy +30 Sell -50 Total: +3 12/19 (for a "losing day" not bad netting 2 pips...the premise behind this strategy is that a currency pair will range enough intraday to profit with both the Buy and Sell...when the price goes strictly in one direction I count that as a losing day with a total potential loss of 50 pip per pair; however, as you see with today's results a losing day can still be profitable :-) EUR/USD Buy +60 Sell -50 GBP/USD Buy +42 Sell -50 Total: +2 12/20 EUR/USD Buy +13 Sell +18 GBP/USD Buy +11 Sell +0 Total: +42 12/21 EUR/USD Buy +13 Sell +4 GBP/USD Buy +23 Sell +1 Total: +41 For the week so far: EUR/USD +81 GBP/USD +7 Not too bad...with one more day to go...

That's great. Amazing. And you are setting your trades at 00:00 GMT right?

Hi Guys... Sorry I've been away for a long while... got back from the states and thrust onto another contract which has just been so hectic... I haven't been doing any trading... How is everybody doing? TraderZone you mentioned you have been testing my strategy... Which particular Variation? With the multiple Profit Targets and what stop loss? How long have you been testing it for and whats your overall results... Its nice to see that this thread has been so successful... I will continue to develop my ideas here again to see if we can perfect this...

It was one of those days where a single pip hit the Trailing Stop during a little retracement but the overall trend was still in tact...ugghhh... On the SELL Eur/USD the Trailing Stop was hit to the pip locking in 14 pips but during the next hour another 15 pips could have been locked in (as of this post the trade if the TS hadn't been hit at 1.3267 the trade would still be open. UPDATE: trade would have closed during the 17:00 five minute candle for a gain of 64 pips if the TS wasn't hit on the pip. Usually I would have monitored the trade better but I did some errands on the way to the office and when I finally got in the trade was stopped out already...urrrgggghhh...The daily trend was definitely working in the direction of the sell). EUR/USD Buy +10 Sell +14 (could've been +64 if I would have been in front of the computer. would've removed the TS and managed it "live" until the downward trend stoppe) GBP/USD Buy +10 Sell -50 Total: -16 A frustrating day because the GBP ran a little over 60 pips before turning just like it did earlier in the week. I might look at moving the SL to 60 or 65 for the GBP. I'm spending some time this weekend looking at that. Also, I might start a new thread dedicated soley to this Daily Strategy as I don't want to step on any toes since this strategy varies from the original one... For the week: EUR/USD: +105 GBP/USD: -33 (caused by 2 losing days that could have been prevented with a 65 pip SL) Still not bad +72 for the week Have a Merry Christmas! Q

These results are really rather mindboggling. A simple straddle and a 15 pip trailing stop and you made 720 bucks on 1 lot trades for the week. No fuss or muss. Small amount of time required. Simply amazing. thanks for sharing these results.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
I echo what Don has just said. Those are great results. I am curious to find out what happens when you move the GBP stop to 60. It would seem that that could help as we all know the pound moves quite a bit more than the Euro. Have you been trading this strategy live QMG? I've been demo-ing it for the past couple of weeks and have seen positive results. Keep us posted on your backtests. Thanks again for sharing this strategy. B

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Yes...been trading it live for two weeks on a mini account. Figure if I'm going to take the time, albeit very little, to set the trades in the evening I might as well profit. I did go back and visually paper test the EUR/USD from April to present and it has averaged +235 per month. When I get the time I'm going to do the GBP/USD at which time I see if a SL of 60 of 65 would make a major difference. I also think there is more "profit" to be made if you micromanage the trade throughout the day. I set the trades at 7:00 pm EST (0:00 GMT) and don't do anything during the night but from 6:00 a.m. to the afternoon I'm able to watch the price action. Yesterday I left over 50 pips on the table by not moving the Trailing Stop to a greater number and got stopped out to the pip--ugghhh--because I wasn't in my office but typically I would have moved that stop because the overall trend at the time was down. What I like about this approach is that if you don't touch the trades they are profitable but they can be even more profitable if can tweak them throughout the day. Q

--- 帖子 #662 ---
HI again OMG, A quick question if I may. When you did your backtest to April, what time frames did you look at? Was it say 1 minute charts or 5 minute charts or Daily charts? I know you set this up as a Daily trade, I was just wondering if you looked at the movement within each day? Thanks much, Scott

--- 帖子 #663 ---
This is not directly related to your strategy, but I noticed that all of your orders (entry, limit, stop) were numbers ending in zero. One sure way to get stopped out is to set your order parameters with numbers ending with zero or five. The big dogs love to take out stops because they know that newbies frequently use numbers divisable by 5 or 10. So add 3 or 4 to your entry or exit parameters and you will probably be more successful.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
5 minute candle...so I'm fairly confident that the results are reliable. Q

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Wow, you have a serious attention to detail. Yes that is very assuring. Thanks for the answer.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
I have been following this thread with interest and working it a little with good results.. just a thought but in the last week i had some sucess with eur/jpy also using this method, might be worth back testing to see results.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hey all, I am new here but I need to know if someone can help me. I am looking to trade the Daily Range Method. I have done lots of manual back testing and like what I found out. I would not like to babysit my trades all through the night so here are my questions. How can I go about doing all of the following? 1. Place a 50 pip straddle of 2 lots. 2. One lot has a target of 30 pips and the 2nd has a trailing stop of 30 or a target of 60 pips - whichever comes first. 3. SL for both lots is 30. Can I place this order all at the same time with a broker's software and go to bed? If not, can I at least place the order for the stops and targets (2 and 3 above) for the 2 lots after getting a ring alert when trade is open after the 50 pip move? If not and I need to use some kind of EA or whatever, can someone tell me what will work? Tradestation, Meta or ? I have no clue as to how these things work or how difficult they are to learn assuming this can be done. Thanks for your help in advance! Brett

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Am I understanding you correctly? You are waiting for the price to move 50 pips before buying or selling? My particular strategy is to buy and sell at 0:00 GMT with a 15 pip trailing stop thus hedging the trade and banking on the fact that the daily price fluctuations will activate and close out both sides of the trade. Q

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Brett... you are more or less following Micardo's original plan for Daily Range strategy. You don;'t need an EA. Here's how I do it. Every day at 5PM EST (22:00 GMT) FXDD gives a new daily candle. I check the opening price on that candle and place my orders. I place a buy stop 55 pips above the open price and also set my stop loss and take profit levels. I also place a sell stop for 50 pips below the open price and set my take profit and stop loss points. I like to place two trades each direction, with differing take profit levels. I also set a trailing stop on the second trade but try to let in run to 60 or 80 pips. All this is possible on Metatrader free of charge from brokers like F X D D or I B F X. Even when I trade with I B F X I use the F X D D charts to get their daily candle, as I B F X issues their daily candle at 7 PM EST (00:00). I spend 10 minutes making lots of trades like this and then forget about it (sort of ) until the next morning. So far Micardo's method is positive for about the last 6 weeks or so. Rather rocky in December though. Good luck. This is NOT to be confused with the interesting QMG method which places market orders in two different directions at 00:00 GMT.

Every day at 5PM EST (22:00 GMT) FXDD gives a new daily candle. I check the opening price on that candle and place my orders.&gt;&gt; Hmm, I thought the consensus was to check the 7 PM EST candle?

I also place a sell stop for 50 pips below the open price and set my take profit and stop loss points. I like to place two trades each direction, with differing take profit levels. I also set a trailing stop on the second trade but try to let in run to 60 or 80 pips.&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is about the same as my strategy. &lt;&lt;All this is possible on Metatrader free of charge from brokers like F X D D or I B F X. Even when I trade with I B F X I use the F X D D charts to get their daily candle, as I B F X issues their daily candle at 7 PM EST (00:00).&gt;&gt; And thus my confusion and dumb question begins! Is Metatrader "free" in every sense of the word? I am leaning towards IBFX so as long as I do, I can go and use Meta which, I assume, is already in their trading platform? If so, is it very difficult to learn how to do if I have never done any programming before? &lt;&lt;This is NOT to be confused with the interesting QMG method which places market orders in two different directions at 00:00 GMT.&gt;&gt; I have not read that thread.

Metatrader "is " the platform at FXDD and I B F X. You download it with no costs when you sign up for a demo or live account. I use the 5 PM price. I don;t really know what the consensus is right now.

I about freaked out when I thought you said, "close this thread ." But this thread actually is a threat. It threatens to become one of the best threads of all time! Yeah, there's about 20 pages of desert you've got to cross - but there are 3 or 4 neat little trading methods in this thread that appear to be both simple to execute and long-term moneymakers. These methods are going to be fully refined pretty soon and this thread may well become an eternal FF treasure chest - or in keeping with the season, a Christmas gift - for all of those wise enough to read it. High-fives to each of the primary contibutors (but not the martingale fan)! And for those just tuning in; Please don't ask about or recommend any indicators. Read the thread! These are Indicator-Free trading methods. Enjoy them and may you earn a ton of pips in the coming year.

Hello, is there anywhere in these posts or in other threads where someone has made an EA for this type of strategy, (just on the daily range method) ? it would be interesting to test it out if there has been one created. Thanks !

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I get the feeling that you didn't read much, if any, of this thread. You can do it your way - but you're cheating yourself by not following the evolution of the thread. At least skim the thing to get a feel for what has taken place. To answer your question - it was decided within the thread to focus on refining the trading techniques to their optimum levels before coding the EA's. The EA's will be pretty simple - with the largest challenge being to ensure that the times are synchronized between the world, your broker and your computer. In the MetaTrader Forum you'll find a thread dealing with the Straddle EA. The idea is similar - but they focus on trading the news rather than breakouts. But back to this thread. I believe it would be worth your time to read it all and take notes - noting the post numbers where techniques are revealed and further refined.

Hello to all, I am not programmer, but it is happened to me that it would be good an indicator that did a work of assistant during the TRADING, following a series of laws that already we have verified, if somebody is able to do it would be wonderful, and if somebody is able to add more laws for the assistant then wonderful.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Laws of the assistant &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; - Mark the entry points (long and short) to 30 or 20 pips (adjustable parameter) of the closing of the previous day. This parameter could be fit automatically, considering the crossed rank the previous day, rank &gt;=100 distance of entrance 30 pips, rank &lt;100 distance order of entrance 20 pips. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; - Mark the points of stop (adjustable parameter). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; - If the price surpasses anyone of the entry points, the program begins to help us. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; - If price surpassed some maximum or minimum level of the previous day, assistant recommend to place stop in benefits, after the entry point. - If price surpassed in 20 pips (adjustable parameter) the entrance level, assistant to warn to take partial benefits, or create a parameter that is “warning to take partial benefits each x pips”. - If a difference greater that 100 pips is reached between the maximum and the minimum of the present day, assistant recommend to close totally the position (average rank of GBPUSD=140) but could be calculated the average rank of last the five days, would be better to give to the warning 10 or 20 pips before arriving at the average rank.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; greetings

I think indicators created by Markj's Batfink method can be modified to fit your need. AndyL

--- 帖子 #679 ---
I do not know that indicator, but thanks for your observation. You have some other law for the assistant?

&lt;TABLE id=texttable&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR vAlign=top&gt;&lt;TD id=gap&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD id=result_cell&gt;I think, that better still would be to calculate the entrance levels (Mark of entry points) doing the average of the rank of the 5 last days, and dividing it between four. &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Well, I am not Micardo but since Nov 15 I have been running a similar method to his and just wanted to share the results so far. I mostly use a 50 pip trigger from the daily open price (FXDD 5pm EST). But not quite. For buy stops I use 55 pips. Stops are the trigger point. I go for 30 pips on the first lot and 60 on the second. I use a 30 pip trailing stop now on the second trade. December has been about break even but November was good. I must admit I haven't traded everyday during the holidays. But for what it's worth, maybe this is close to real-world results.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
So then you entered 2 standard 100,000 lots on each trigger? Have you looked at the days you missed to see if you would have profited or lost? It looks like you missed many days. I still don't know how accurate these results are though. This month span was obvisously great for trending systems. I'd be careful about continuing at that size unless your account can handle it. How'd it feel to lose $2100 just like that on the 7th and 11th? I'm not sure why you lost on those days though, GFT is showing nicely trending days. Perhaps our times are set up differently. Something to look at is that you never lost on a trade without losing on both. When you add up the wins on the 2nd lot that you let ride, it averages out to 28.6 pips, even with the big 60 and 80 pip profits. Looking at your rules again, how did you get the 80 pips on the 22nd of November? So you would have been better just exiting both lots at the 30 pip point. The average profit on the 2nd lot was 28.6 pips and that's with the 80 pip day. If you make that a 60 pip day then the average on the 2nd lot is 27.3 pips. If you had just exited at 30 pips on the 2nd lot that would be 2.6 pips per trade more. 2.6 X 15 winning trades = 40 pips = $400 more in your pocket. That's an easy 9 percent increase in profits right there. This is why I tried to analyze the data from excel the way I did weeks ago. You probably would have blown the results you got out of the water if you had simply exited all trades after a 35 pip move on both lots. I still say there is an efficient point for each trading day rather than exiting at multiple points. Looking at your figures again I am confused some more. You have a 30 pip trailing stop on the second lot. How did you exit some of them at 38 pips profit, or $380 profit? That would have to mean price would have moved to +68 pips and then drop the 30 back to only 38 pips profit. The same goes for many of the 330 pip days. I'll have to assume that since you took an 800 pip profit that you didnt follow your rules discreetly. Again, thats why I explored this strategy through excel. I believe there is one efficient point. Unfortunately it means we allow more losers and right now with a 30 TP and 50/55SL it means we lose more than what we win. When you lose you lose big. The 7th and 11th total losses are almost half of your total profits. Imagine if you had caught another two days like that. I've been debating setting a TP/SL for myself in my trendline trading system of TP 75 SL 50 just to allow for the noise and also win more than when I lose. But hey, you can't complain about $4480 bucks in your pocket off of little work right? That's a nice living if the system is that consistent.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Like I said. This is real world results. Including my personal mistakes on addition for stop loss, and at least twice hitting the wrong button on trailing stop (or it just didn't work!) At least two of the holidays that I didn't trade were winning days. The day I had 38 pips on one trade, I got up in the morning and looked at the trade, got nervous and said "that's enough" and closed out manually! Rather than take two lots on smaller pips like 35, I am running a comparison test of only one lot but setting the TP at 100. Then set a trail of say, around 25 pips. I'm beginning to think that fewer, bigger winners might be the way to go. Like the android in "Alien" said, "still collating".

Hello is there an EA for this strategy already? how is it doing so far? Anyways im a programmer and i would like to give this strategy a try and convert it to EA, if there is still none yet. Anyways im getting lost in the thread with so many variations to the method. Can someone point me to the direction of the method most suitable for EA, one that is most mechanical with good risk reward ratio. Thanks and Kind Regards, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Just read the first 5 or 6 pages of the thread. The best stuff is probably in there. Look for posts by Kamando and Micardo for the basic stuff. Are you using the EA for backtesting? I can't think of any other reason. It only takes me 5 minutes a day to set up three different accounts for the trades (various methods).

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Thanks, yes for backtest and for trading. I only use EAs for my trading activites I jsut leave it to do its thing. because when I trade manually im prone to divert from the strategy, with EAs I get to implement the strategy without me messing it up.(Im prone to adjust TP because I get often greedy ) Anyways thanks for pointing me to the right direction, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #687 ---
I would just like to encourage you to code an EA because of higher level of trustiness in timing and discipline as well as the better opportunity of tweakening the strategy. Anyway, there are a few EAs that use daily breakout strategy though I have not find that that would be able to place more than one orders to both short and long direction. (I mean it is a mini grid straddle where the SELL_STOP and BUY_STOP orders are in a kind of balance. I traded this kind of setup for a period of time earlier and it was successful.) Should you are interested I can provide some more details.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Ok, I have entered numbers in my program until I just can't do it anymore. LOL Weekly Strategy - It appears if you take the Sunday open price and put a straddle of 115 pips from the open in both directions with a 60 pip s/l going for 70 pips - you would've been positive in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. If you exclude 2003, you could've gone for 85 pips. 2006 was a fantastic year and you could've gone way higher (150 or higher), but I personally feel more comfortable going for 70 or 85 (for some reason I like using 2003 data). If a trade was entered and never made the target, it was closed at 19:45 GMT on Friday (mostly because the data I have closed at this time some points during the year, so I just used it). Most trades either passed or failed before this time anyway. Oh, and I only went one direction. If a trade was hit for long, the sell was cancelled. I have to modify my program to allow for both. I just have to take the time to do it. Also, what most people would NOT like (but I do) is that the only real way to make it work is to double up. After 1 failed double up next trade. The maximum (up to now) failures in a row has been 4. I'll be happy to post the actual results if anyone wants to know them.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I'll bite. What were the results?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
going for 70 to prevent more than 4 in a row failures (2003 caused more than 4) 2003 = 1661 2004 = 1942 2005 = 2325 2006 = 1981 going for 85 and exclude 2003. 2004 = 2587 2005 = 3395 2006 = 3356 You might think you could increase pip target each year since 2003 could only get 70, but going for more than 85 in 2005 caused 5 in a row failure. I try to prevent this because of doubling up. Using mini-lots you buy 1 lot, then 2, then 4, then 8 but because 4 can fail in a row the next one has to be 16 lots, which in my testing always won. I would not be comfortable buying 32 lots or 64 lots so that is why I limited it to 4 losses. Of course allowing 5 in a row resulted in huge profits though. Another idea would be using the 115 wait, 70, 60s/l just as a guide and wait for 4 in a row to fail (or 1,2, or 3) before starting, and knowing the next trade will most likely win and buying 10 lots or whatever. I included this as an option in my program and here are the total results 2003 - 2006 going for 70 and waiting til 4 fail in a row = 350 pips. Multiply by 10 lots = 3500 (only happened 5 times) 2004 - 2006 going for 85 and waiting til 4 fail in a row = 340 pips X 10 lots = 3400 (only happened 4 times and if you kept it at 70 it only happened twice which netted 140) I should also say these are net pips. I deducted my 5 pip spread on the pound already.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
I would suggest not bothering with martingale in this strategy, or almost any strategy. It works, yes, but look what you've done. You can only trade 1 minilot to be able to martingale on the trades following it. I think the profits would add up greater if you just risked 1 standard lot on each trade and took the larger wins/losses, but didn't try to cover the losses. Get what I'm saying? If your account can handle trading a standard lot then do that rather then only play for 1 minilot wins. Its just not worth it. Here is the minimum martingale risk for consecutive losses and allow yourself to only breakeven at the end. 1 -1 -2 - 4 - 8. So on the 5th trade you've already lost 8% of your account and risking 8% on the last trade. The losses could be 16% of your account and then it only gets uglier from there. To avoid huge losses you use the minilots and your account grows slowly. A lot of risk for such slow growth. Lame. Anyways, are those pip totals including martingaling or not? Something to consider also. You mentioned your idea of waiting for the 4 losses in a row. What about waiting for 4 wins in a row and then taking the trade opposite what is signaled? How many times did it win 4 times in a row. You could essentially double your pip totals right there. Matt

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I don't agree with you on the double-up for mini or super-mini accounts. I am not psychologically ready to trade standard lots, nor do I have the money in my account for that. We can agree to disagree I suppose. There were 7 wins in a row, so going opposite after 4 wins didn't work most of the time. As far as not doubling up, here are the best results and numbers to use: 130 wait, 200 s/l and shoot for 400 pips. 2004 = 6 hit tp, 13 hit s/l, 21 closed up, 10 closed down = 1796 total. Account total never went in negative mostly because first 2 weeks were one of the 6 winners. 2005 = 3 hit tp, 7 hit s/l, 21 closed up, 13 closed down = 1153 total. Lowest account got was -232 2006 = 0 hit tp, 6 hit s/l, 25 closed up, 18 closed down = 1459 total. Lowest account got was -515 Grand total was 4408 If you'd rather have more hits, then 130 wait, 200 s/l shoot for 250 pips 2004 = 14 hit tp, 13 hit s/l, 13 closed up, 10 closed down = 1408. Account stayed positive. 2005 = 8 hit tp, 7 hit s/l, 16 closed up, 13 closed down = 1008. Lowest account got was -382. 2006 = 9 hit tp, 6 hit s/l, 16 closed up, 18 closed down = 1381. Lowest account got was -611. Grand total was 3797. As you can see, not once in 2006 did a week hit the 400 pip target, which is wierd, but if it got to 250 pip target when going for 400, it always closed up anyway, plus you got more pips, so that is why I think going for 400 was the best.

Just curious, did you trade this much over the holidays? Wondering how it turned out as things tend to be somewhat choppy during the holidays, possibly improving results? Am going to start demo'ing this now that the holidays are over. David

--- 帖子 #694 ---
David... I did trade it over the last week or so albeit very sporadically because of the slowness of the market. I don't have my exact numbers in front of me but I believe I made around 50 pips or so last week. I have found that when one market isn't open or there isn't "quality" news events there is less of a chance of a movement back and forth. I do know one of the days I traded last week I had a SL activated (i.e. losing 50 pips) but also make over 50 on the opposite direction. It seemed the market picked a direction during the last few days and stayed moving in that direction. I will probably go in tonight... Q

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi Guys I dont kno where you guys have got upto with this thread.... or how the system has been developed but I thought I would make things a little easier for the newcomers to the thread.... I have attached a document which gives a complete run down of the origional 2 systems which got this thread started... I will post all of the results on both systems for november and december which are missing from this document unless someone has been trading either of them and wishes to share the reults. Also would someone be kind enough to update me on what the strategies have evolved into or which are the main strategies in development at the moment... this way I can add my 2 pips

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Thanks Micardo, I am looking forward to the latest results. I am also intersted in what Kamanda was doing and wonder if anyone has been using that method and can share results?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I know traderone is in here once in a while. Did you ever come up with the results of this post from weeks ago? How many of the 2400 pips did you give back? Quick thoughts everyone. I'm wondering if strategies such as this are worth while only if you apply them to several currencies. My weekly data showed to average around 125-145 pips on gbp/usd a month. If you can get 100 pips a month from several pairs it'll add up. Any suggestions for other pairs that might work well with this? Matt

Firstly I’d like to say thankyou to Micardo and MarkJ for their inspiration and contribution. The trading plans below were originally based upon MarkJ’s plan, so respect to him.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; My thoughts on the DRS (daily range strategy) is that the objective of the strategy is to find a point in price and time where GBP takes sustainable direction to trigger the TP’s with an acceptable level of volatility and drawdown. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The Big Ben paper indicates GBP trades lightly in the Asian session, which is able to be seen on the chart. The GBP has two major trading sessions being the UK and US sessions. There is a tendency for price to consolidate prior to the open of both sessions and to take direction shortly after the open. I’ve noticed that the trend established from UK open doesn’t necessarily persist through the US open. For instance a news release at US open can revert a trend. I’ve also noticed direction seems to weaken after the UK close. So the two periods in time I’m interested in trading is from UK open to US open and US open to UK close. I’ve taken the view of trading these sessions discretely, that is, to close any open positions at US open rather than risk price hitting the TSL upon news or trend reversion.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I’ve back tested several derivations of the plans below over a randomly selected three week period which included both trending and non-trending price action. I tested 3 different SL systems:1) stop set at 20 pips and not moved – lost pips, 2) 20 pip TSL which engages when price moves 20 pips – lost pips 3) 20 pip TSL which starts to trail immediately upon entry – made pips. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; My current broker doesn’t offer TSL’s, but that is not a problem. Can anyone recommend a broker that offers a TSL that trails immediately, MT4, preferably 3 pip spread and they reckon they are ok? &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I tested two strangles 20 pip and 25 pip. There wasn’t much difference between them however the 25 pip was a little better. It would be worth testing both over a larger sample size to see if it changes the result. To address JillyB’s comment about the significance of round numbers, I think it has an effect on instruments traded on centralised exchanges, I’m not sure that that holds true with instruments traded OTC. I think different data feeds and spreads would confound this issue. Heh, it has been hard enough to even establish when London opens due to time zones and DST. When I was back testing I didn’t notice a higher frequency of entry and revert due to the round numbers.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; My view on multiple TP’s is that each plan (as in Entry, TP &amp; SL) should hold it’s own weight individually and can be combined to smooth the equity curve and profit multiple times from one event. Originally I tested the 4 TP’s with the expectation of dropping the weakest, however they are all profitable so I didn’t see a good reason to drop any of them. In order of most profitable to least 80, 50, 30, 14. I think it was more difficult for the higher win/loss ratio to compensate for the lower profit/loss ratio caused by the 20 SL. I haven’t tested it, however I think moving the 14 to a 20 TP may increase the profitability by balancing the profit/loss ratio.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Enough yabba, here are the plans.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Trav UK 25 DRS v1 &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Place a 4 entry strangle at UK open , 25 pips away from UK open price.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TP: Target Profit levels are 14, 30, 50, 80 pips away from entry.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TSL: A 20 pip trailing stop loss which is initiated at entry is applied to all positions.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TS: A timed stop is also applied so all positions are closed at US open .&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Close the position when TP, TSL or TS is triggered. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; This is not an OCO order.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; There is no re-entry.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Trav US 25 DRS v1 &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Place a 4 entry strangle at US open , 25 pips away from US open price.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TP: Target Profit levels are 14, 30, 50, 80 pips away from entry.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TSL: A 20 pip trailing stop loss which is initiated at entry is applied to all positions.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TS: A timed stop is also applied so all positions are closed at UK close .&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Close the position when TP, TSL or TS is triggered. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; This is not an OCO order.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; There is no re-entry.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; So how did they do over the 3 week sample?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; UK 20: 247 pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; UK 25: 287 pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; US 20: -142 pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; US 25: -109 pips&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; These figures are net (3 pip spread).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Every trading plan is a balance. I’m happy with the result of the UK 25. I think the US plan still has merit, just need to find the right combination for instance maybe a 30 or 35 strangle with perhaps a lesser TP. More work needed.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I really think this strategy needs to be tested over a longer time period before going live to negate any biases caused by a small sample size. Since manually back testing is arduous work and this is a simple mechanical system, Mikhail, if you have the ability and interest in converting this into an EA it would really be appreciated. BTW Athalon7 posted an EA post No. 553. Not sure if it is easier to modify and exisitng one or start anew.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
I have EA for you will post it here later. Question though what time in GMT is US Open and US close. I know its a silly question but im really bad at time conversion. Kind Regards, Mikhail

Hi Trav, I have been following this thread for a while as I have been trading a variant of Micardo's style, but have been analyzing MarkJ's method, which is similar to your's as you mentioned. I am a programmer and plan to spend this weekend coding up your method as it has a great deal of merit, I believe. Could you please specify what times GMT you are using for the various OPEN/CLOSES? This will help in testing and to establish defaults. Rick

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hello, Normally I dont do EAs for free but Im very grateful for everyone here in this thread that shared this strategy. So to contribute to your kind efforts here is an EA based on Trav's Strategy. You can change almost all the variables but EA will always open 4 buy stop and 4 sell stop orders. Also you must change the variables "starthour" and "endHour" based on your brokers time. Ive backtested this EA via strategy tester but i dont feel results are accurate for this particular EA because time being the most critical variable for this stratgy and strategy tester sometimes jsut averages time on history charts. So the only way to go is forwardtesting. Thanks Again for sharing your discoveries with everyone so here i present the DRS v1 EA Kind Regards, Mikhail

I just tried to use this EA, and it didn't work for me. Now I am not real good with these things, so could someone tell me how to install it properly? thanks

On which pair did you backtest your weekly strategy? Why didn't you include 2002?

--- 帖子 #705 ---
gbp/usd only I think the daily range in 2002 was not as high as 2003 forward or it was more volatile to cause the s/l to be hit a lot. There were probably numbers for 2002 back to say 1999 or so, where you got less pips or didn't have to wait as much. I ran the same numbers for 2002 and you didn't make much. Just like it may be time to exclude 2003.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I ran the numbers based on the original strategy 50 pip entry buy or sell away from the opening price at 00:00 GMT, 30 pip stop loss and a 30 pip limit. Based on what I can afford ( 3 standard lots a trade) or 90 pips at risk a trade, the results were about $52,000 to $55,000 in profit each year and I would open a $20,000 account for the initial nut. I back tested this day by day and now am contemplating risking the 20K. This method is OK as long as the daily average range remains strong. The most losers in a row were 4. I had some great months 9K to 13K based on my above parameters of risk, some with 0 or break even and 1 month with only a $900.00 loss. I didn't do 2002 as it appeared that that year didn't have a large daily range. It appeared a break even at best for the first 3 months, so I left it there. 2003 to 2006 had great results. Since I am retired and sell real estate part time, this extra 50K would be a great little addition.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
what did you exactly do? Did you re-enter if s/l hit? Did you play both sides (if buy failed, the sell was allowed to executed)? How did you backtest (what timeframe of data did you use)?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Once the buy and sell entry was placed, I stepped away from the computer except at the appropriate time the next day. Once a buy or sell was executed, I let it run its course. I didn't re-enter if I was stopped out. I also left entries alone in the opposite direction of the first entry order and didn't cancel the opposite potential trade. No monitoring at all.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
I just used the opening price at 00:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
did you manually backtest or use a program? What chart data timeframe (15m, 1hr, 4hr, daily) did you use? I am only asking because I do not get good results in total with the 50 wait. I wanted to see what you did.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Thanks Mikhail and you were so fast. I have to admit time conversions and DST drive me crazy. There is a link to a pretty good conversion clock under &lt;TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR vAlign=bottom&gt;&lt;TD&gt; http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...bits_start.gif &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt; &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="100%"&gt; Forex Forums &gt; Forex Discussion &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD class=navbar style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; PADDING-TOP: 1px" colSpan=3&gt; http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor..._finallink.gif &lt;!-- google_ad_section_start --&gt;Dedicated Clock for International Forex Markets. &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; DST will effect the backtesting of this strategy. Here are the conditions: From the last Sunday in October through the last Saturday in March standard time in the United States of America and other European countries is noted as Central Standard Time (CST), (EST), (MST) or (PST). During summer, that is, from the last Sunday in March through the Last Saturday in October, daylight savings time is noted as Central Daylight Time (CDT), (EDT), (MDT) or (PDT) which is one hour added to standard time. So to convert EDT to GMT, just add four(4) hours.

I have checked some charts in Nov and the event seems to have moved an hour with the change from DST. Since an OTC market doesn't have an official open it is not surprising that the times I identified are not exactly the same as the generally quoted trading hours. To avoid confusion it would be best to use the times stated above rather than the generally quoted trading hours. Thanks again Mickhail.

I'm starting to really consider using this strategy on several of the major uncorrelated pairs. The uncorrelated thread in the discussion forum really got me thinking. Adding uncorrelated pairs to your trading really is a form of hedging. It increases the profits, but not the risk. It minimizes drawdown as well. This is because if we know our system to be profitable then the systems will spend more time winning trades than losing them. So to have two uncorrelated pairs losing at the same time is unlikely, but them winning together isn't unhead of. So if one loses, it's likely the other won. So for the day you're more even than down, which makes it more surviveable. The drawdown is more maneagable. It's the law of large numbers. Therefore we could eliminate the problem of getting stuck in a ranging month. What're the chances several uncorrelated pairs range at the same time? Suddenly my interest in all of this is peaked once again. Since it takes about 1 minute to set up trades I can easily see myself trading many pairs like this. I really never thought of multiple pairs as a hedging strategy. Anyone want to take a shot at which pairs we should use and what TP, SL, triggers we should use on them? Matt

TRAV: So basically you are saying based on previous results on InterbankFx &amp; Velocity4x Brokers which are on GMT 0, trading time should be 6-12 GMT as per your last post and not actual london Open of GMT 8 and close at US open of GMT 13?

--- 帖子 #714 ---
The broker I currently use is IG Markets which uses GMT on their time scale. Regardless of the broker, if you convert to GMT and use the times quoted below you should be using the reference points as I did. So technically the times I have used are not the generally accepted open and closing times. They have the effect of opening the position in a consolidation prior to a breakout and trading the directional move of the UK/US trading session. So I would recommend using the quoted times above rather than the generally accepted open and close times. I'm just changing to a faster ISP so will go dark for a few days. Will answer any queries on monday.

PJ, be aware you could be creating a synthetic cross currency trade, which isn't really advisable. eg: +1 GBP/USD, +1 USD/JPY approximately equals a synthetic +2 GBP/JPY I would recommend learning about synthetic positions before attempting this type of trade. You will probably conclude they are unnecessarily complicated. If your main goal is to trade profitably, unnecessary complications will simply make attaining that goal more difficult.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I'll look into them. There have to be a couple pairs that aren't like that though. All we need are a handful to trade consistently. I should probably hold off on this question till after I read about synthetic pairs, but quickly looking at gbp/usd and usd/jpy shows that they're not trading in similar manners. Isn't that all we should concern ourselves with is the two pairs ability to diverge from one another? Matt

Here is what I did for back testing the original daily range strategy: I looked on the charts at FXCM and went back to 2003 to the present looking at 1 hr. charts but keying in on only the opening price at 4pm PST which is 00:00 GMT. 1. Step one - I wrote down the opening price 2. I added 50 pips to the opening price to get the entry for a buy 3. I subtracted 50 pips to the opening price to get the entry for a sell. 4. I set a hard 30 pip stop loss and a 30 pip limit to each entry. 5. If a buy or sell was entered, I left the other opposite entry alone without cancelling. 6. If I was stopped out on a buy or sell, I didn't re-enter. 7. If an order was entered and still in play, I let it run until sitting down at my computer at 4pm PST. 8. I looked at each day on hour charts and figured out the entry and whether or not I would of been stopped or not. At the end of the month, I just noted the wins and losses and figured out the difference. Trading 3 standard lots with a $20,000 initial balance would put at risk 90 pips a trade (30 pips X 3 lots). The most losses in a row were 4 during the period of 2003 to the end of 2006. The worst month trading my scenario was - $900.00 and the best was over $13,000. I am still testing and now using a 30 pip trailing stop loss. Tuesday was a huge win with over $4,500 in profit using 3 standard lots. Take a look at the hourly charts. Wednesday a winner too, with $960.00 using a 30 pip trailing stop loss. I used FXCM charts to view back data and I use FXSOLUTIONS to place my entry orders.

Does the pip range of the pair matter? for example GBP/usa has a low pip range the day before would you enter your orders or would it be best to wait for the next day. or is this system best to use the next day after a low pip range day ?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Here is data for January 2006. Please help me understand how you got profit. It may be because the hour candle can hit a buy, run down to the s/l and then end up being a winner. Maybe even something to look at or add to the system. Also, are you including the spread? For a 5 pip spread, it would have to go up 35 pips to net 30. With a 30 s/l would equal a 35 true loss. Just trying to see why you are getting different results. The below in yellow are double trades on the same day.

Llambert, What is your strategy for this result? is it to enter at 50 pips above or below 00:00 and take 1st profit at 30? In my data analysis you have a 50% chance of the market reaching 70 pips above open (meaning entering at 40 instead of 50) even less for 80. That's will give a breakeven or a little above or below at best. In my data data analysis price also hits 55 above open and then retraces enough for 50 not to be the best entry price from my experience.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hey Markj, hope all is well with you. This isn't my strategy. I ran it through my program that looks at the 15 m data and goes 50 up/down from gmt open every day. Takes 30 pip target and 30 s/l. There is another poster on here saying it produces great results, but I am showing it doesn't. There is something I am missing or they are missing. Trying to find out what.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
When testing, I was looking at hourly bars. I didn't have a program to use and did it manually. Of course, an hour bar could have some movement in it that I can't see resulting in a stop. I will retest with 15 minute bars before risking live money. Thanks for your observations. I showed a net profit for Jan. 06 and you show a loss, so I will give it a try with the 15 minute bars. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
LLambert, Rather than bash past results, I will forward test for 2 months using a demo with the original entry rules and a 30 pip trailing stop, no limit. Maybe, I will run a test side by side with 30 pip/40 pip/ 50 pip from opening price at 00:00 gmt entry with a 30 pip trailer. I am not going to risk live money until I am absolutely sure!!

So this strategy should have win loss of 1/1 with the same take profit as loss. Add some descretion could improve your results i.e. trading with 50 day momentem etc. Trailing your stop will limit your losses but it's a pretty fine line.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
can anyone explain the pros &amp; cons of trailing stops to me is it better to use a larger TS when going for larger targets? example: if i bot cable at 1.9500 with a stop of 1.9475 (25 pips) and a trailing stop of 50 pips after a 50 pip movment what would my new stop become? greg

--- 帖子 #726 ---
On I B F X your trailing stop would be break even after the 50 pip move in your favor. Then it would be pulled along as you go more in your favor. If you went 70 pips in your favor and then for some reason the market crashed you would be stopped out at a 20 pip win. Not all brokers use this kind of stop but I B F X does.

can someone be kind enough to point me to a website that can teach me how to setup a backtest on metatrader. thanks GREG.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Hello, Started looking at this post earlier today as the original strategy is something i've been looking at roughly, for a few weeks. I've read up to page 29, but didnt get past there. Is there a developed EA for this yet? Just a thought. But as i can see theres around 2-3 different and fairly successful methods developed from this post. Would it be worth creating an EA for each and trading on seperate accounts, then if one EA results are down, hopefully, the others will mean your still in profit? The my thoughts summarised - otherwise, some of the talk in this post is awesome.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
No EA that I know of. I j just place the trades by hand. Takes 5 minutes on three different accounts. Backtesting is not very accurate using EAs on MT4 I'm afraid. If there is a moderator looking in, why are the tables etc. in the previous messages all screwed up now? Finding this all over the forum. Thanks for looking into it.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
I'm a complete newbie to forex to be honest, my account is up, but i'm just trying to spot trends, just luck really. Am i right in saying i shouldve done this: 1.9591 = sell 1.9641 = stop loss 1.9561 = take profit 1.9691 = Buy 1.9641 = stop loss 1.9711 = take profit I decided not to go with the buying two lots etc and just try to get the profit on one lot first. Once one buy/sell has been reached and an order triggered, do i cancel the other one. I've been waiting for it to go 40/50pips above 00.00 GMT then placing a trade 40/50 above normally means a small reverse = sell 40/50 below normally means a small reverse = buy The reverse is small but you can usually catch 8-15 pips in it and i've been using a 30pip stop loss, not exactly the best strategy, but it earned me a few coins (not always going from 00.00 gmt, sometimes going from different times, and different currencies seems though im on a demo.) Thanks

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Kwackers... Your orders look almost right to me if you are only going for 30 pips. I think the take profit on the buy should be 1.9721 instead of 1.9711. I don't cancel my opposite untriggered orders until the next day. (There's a good reason for that, I'm usually asleep ) What are you talking about on the 40/50 above = sell? Would like to hear more about that!

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hello, Thanks for that 9711 is actually on order for .9721, just a typo, glad to see your on your toes! ok, so you place your self at the market at a certain time, as this thread seems to like 00.00GMT we will go with that. For my sake so i don't have to explain it twice - This example will be X pips ABOVE the 00.00GMT price. 1.9439 was the open price 30 pips up was 1.9469 @ 7.00GMT - SELL at this price expecting a small decrease in price. Rough guide, usually 10-20 pips. This went on to peak at 1.9485 not long after we would of entered (so a stop of 20-30 would of been fine in this case) then dropped to 1.9446 within 2 hours of us opening...thats 23 pips below what we would've entered at. Of course you can try different times of the day, i'm not very structured in the way i do things, for example, my explanation of my 'theory' !!! You could wait for 30/40/50 pips above before you enter, go for 1-25 pips, set stops from 10-50 to increase the likely hood of a winning trade. Like i say i havn't investigated this paticulary, but i've checked a few days, and it would of come out profitable depending on the range, profit, stop loss etc. your thoughts?

62a94, check out the modellingquality.pdf by Hendrick in the first post. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=8820 Kwackers, mikhaildgreat in post 703 gratiously wrote an EA for my strategy. Since my strategy is based on Markj's which is also similar to Micardo's I wouldn't expect it would be difficult to modify to the other strategies. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...&amp;page=47&amp;pp=15 Since these strategies are correlated I would be cautious about running more than one at any one point in time. It would be possible to have an entry triggered for Micardo's + Markj's + Trav's at one time. This may compound your win or loss, which apart from making you a manic depressive may risk more of your bank at one point in time than should be exposed to the market.

Lost 50 pips on Demo

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hi people... I have had a few PM's from people regarding the strategies... No has yet attached a summary of where the strategies are currently at or there performance but I offer for those trying to catch up the origional summaries of the strategies... These are as they were in November time when Markj and I were working on the strategy but haven't had any time since to do more testing... I hope this helps...

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hello, Am i right in saying we would've lost 50 pips today? It's a good strategy, i suppose the whole thing about, 'where shall i put the stop' certainly came into play today, as you wouldve hit profit today. I'll post a sample of my theory, please let me know what you think - it is less pip profit i admit, but it can work througout the day generally.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Ok, So that's the basis, goes on the same routes as Micardo's really, just that if it goes 30-50 one way, we should be able to pick a 10-15 pip profit up on it going the other way fairly quickly The figures for the range of currency (ie: setting an order at 40 pips) is not fixed, i'm undecided whether to set it at 30,40,45 or 50 pips, and same with profit, as 10 pips can be caught quite easily, but there regulary are times when you can catch up to 25 pips and obviously less frequent times where you couldve caught 50. Let me know what you think. Did you trade last night? hows the overall perormance of your strategy now? Thanks

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Hi Micardo Mark has not been in the forum for a very long time, have you heard anything from him?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi Kwackers, I'm following this strategy in a real account since january 2 2007 but with diferent parameters. And since last friday i lost 27 pips per day (friday, monday and today). It gives me net 53 pips loss from the begining (01/02/2007). The reason of this consecutive loses is that the strategy doesn't work well in days without important news over de USD. The trend's range is tighty, and it works better with volatility. So here is something very important: don't trade if market doesn't wait important news. Regards,

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I suppose it's the overall your after anyway - Maybe highlight days you should and shouldnt trade, then you can start to see the % of wins increase. Did you have a look at my Simple Strategy? I'm just working on Range from 00.00GMT, Stop loss and Take Profit to see which one works best and then i'll start testing it from tonight

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Here's something to try. Just place your straddles at the end of Monday and Wednesday and Thursday. (That way we would trad only Tues, Thurs, and Frid). I have some stats that show those are the historically most volatile days of the week. Some of my backtesting shows that it doesn't always work that way, but it might be a method to increase probability for success. Hey Kwackers! I'm down over 1500 bucks today. Both lots on the buy went bad and now I've triggered the short and gone the wrong direction there too! After two months I'm now about break even. A month ago I was well ahead in the game. Sigh.

Kwackers, I looked at your strategy. Basically it's the same i'm using. The diference are the parameters used. This are mine: - Each day i put two STOP ORDERS based on 00:00 GMT OPEN trade of GBPUSD pair. - Enter 58 pips above (buy) or below (sell) OPEN GBPUSD. - Limit 15 pips from enter. - Stop 27 pips from enter. I backtested this parameters from 29/05/2006 to 29/12/2006. And this are de results: 1% double loss (sell and buy). 2% double profit (sell and buy). 62% profit (sell or buy). 15% loss (sell or buy). 19% didn't trade. In 155 trading days the systems returns 834 pips of profit. It represents 27 pips per week. It is not so profitable in pips, buy with a good combination of money management rules, it gives 4756% in the period analized. Starting with an hipotetical balance of USD 250 on may 29, at december 29 you would get 7317 USD. In addition, the sistem is very simple, and you don't need to be in front the charts to much time. Thats are the reasons why i decided to start using this method in my real account: simple and no time demand. The backtest was made without considering fundamental information. But analizing the worst weeks i realized that there isn't a real trend. What i mean it was very tighty. The same that happened today and yesterday with de GBPUSD pair. This kind of days it is better don't trade. I think tomorrow, with USD PPI report, will be a nice day for this method. If you want, i can explain the reasons of the parameters used. I also backtested this parameters: ENTER LIMIT STOP 58 22 25 58 27 27 56 60 38 56 40 30 56 50 100 56 110 100 I hope this help all of us. Regards,

Hi Traderone, I agree with you that tues, thurs and frid are the best days for this strategy. Today i lose 27 pips by 3rd. consecutive day. I can see that if you place the orders at 9:00 GMT, very near London market open, instead do that at 00:00 gmt you will avoid enter in a tighty market o an extreme volatile market. I'm using this strategy on my real account, and this give me a profit on 05/01/07, and didn't trade on 09/01/07. If you watch a 5' minutes chart of that days, you'll see a loss in both if orders were scheduled at 00:00 gmt and before 9:00 gmt. Regards.

RAMA, I think you might not have noticed that Kwackers' entries are for reversal trades from what you are doing. Here is a snip from his doc.... Example 1) 1.8800 2) Buy 1 lot = 1.8750 Sell 1 Lot = 1.8850 3) Stop Loss : Buy = 1.8720 Sell = 1.8880 Buy Take Profit 1 = 1.8765 Sell Take Profit 1 = 1.8835 If you will notice, if the price goes DOWN 50 pips then he BUYS! and vice versa. I'll have to look at this very closely!

Why do you think his nickname is Kwackers?

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Yes i notice it's a reversal system. I answered at its own thread.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Isn't it? Perhaps i confused a bank name, or a software with a nickname because english is not my natural languge? I beg you pardon, whatever your nickname is.

Me - well errr....kwackers i guess? Anyway if anybody would care to comment, please do so on my thread which is 'Another Range strategy GBP/USD', trying not to HIJACK micardos thread, as like i said, he probably has a better theory than mine.

Just joking around rama obama sama- I think you missed the jest of the joke-I mean you cats were talking about averaging 27 pips per week and I thought that was a bit far-out so I said why do you think they call him kwackers which to me is similiar to krackers which is sorta nutty like woody allen if you catch my drift. Oh well, I'm feeling groovy so I'm going to split this joint. cheers~

Kwackers, 27 pips p/wk is a marginal profit. I hope that figure is net otherwise spread will blow it out of the water. You will need to achieve a win/loss of around 80% for a trade with a 15TP and 30SL to be profitable. Hope you are running a TSL on the 80TP cause it is a lot of profit to give away if price reverts after entry. Best of luck. Traderone, We actually need directional/trending movement rather than volatility. The whipsaws and generally non-directional movement challenge the profitability of this system. My latest thoughts are: the most profitable days are when the market shows strong direction. The least profitable days are when the market is volatile and whipsaws around taking out both entries and SL's. On a non-trending day I have a good chance of the 14TP being triggered, however it is very unlikely that the 50 or 80TP will meet its target so my thought about refining the strategy is to apply the larger TP's (eg 50TP &amp; 80TP) on trending days and do not apply them on non-trending days. This bodes the question what is a good indicator to determine what is a trending v's non-trending day. Then would the indicator be sophisticated enough to switch on the TP's depending upon the strength of the trend. For instance: non-trending=14TP, slight trend=14 &amp; 30TP, trending=14, 30 &amp; 50TP, strong trend=14, 30, 50 &amp; 80TP. I haven't explored this further at this stage. If anyone can suggest an indicator it would be appreciated. Good to hear from you Micardo.

Hi Mikhail. I've been thinking of some ways of developing the DRS EA further. I haven't written MQ4 before, so any help would be appreciated, but if not, would you mind posting the MQ4 version of your DRS EA so I can continue this project? My current thoughts are to: Stage 1 Optimise it for time and for price targets. A larger first TP, for instance, 20pips may work better than the 14TP because of the difference in the profit/loss ratio. Stage2 Add in Money Mgt such as in Phoenix Stage3 Add code to switch the Entries and TP's on or off depending upon the likelihood of them being sucessfully achieved. The method I have thought of is to look back to the period between the start and end time settings of the previous two days, take the difference between the open and the high of that period over the last two days and average it. If the TP is &gt;= the look back then allow the position to open else exit. Ditto for open and low. These two events should be independent of each other. So for instance, if we are in a strong uptrend all the long positions will be allowed and the short positions will not be allowed. I haven't backtested this theory however I think it should increase the number of positions in a trending market and reduce the number of positions in a nontrending market which should hopefully increase the profitability of the system. Stage4 Allow the money mgt % of free margin (allowed per trade) to be incrementally increased (by a % of free margin) upon consecutive wins up to a ceiling. Each trade should be treated individually. For example, if the Long 30TP consecutively wins the % of free margin per trade gets incremented, however if the Long 50TP doesn't win it doesn't get incremented. This should allow larger positions to be taken when the market is trending or at least when you are consecutively winning for whatever reason. This should increase the profitability of the system. I think this may be in Phoenix as well. I think after completing these stages of development the EA would be really quite powerful. Thankyou in advance.

At the risk of this thread becoming a monologue. I've been backtesting and optimising the time and price inputs. The methodology I've used is to optimise over 2006 data and test against 2005 data. My view on multiple TP’s is that each plan (as in Entry, TP &amp; SL) should hold it’s own weight individually and can be combined to smooth the equity curve and profit multiple times from one event. So I tested each plan independently. The good news is that after optimisation I produced some fantastic results; TP1 50% ROC, TP2 100% ROC. The bad news is when I tested it against 2005 data it produced a negative result so the strategy for 2006 did not hold true for 2005. This got me thinking - does that mean the methodology of optimising over 1 year doesn't produce a robust result? Does that mean I should ditch that method and try perhaps a rolling optimisation eg: optimise for dec apply to jan, optimise for jan apply to feb etc. Maybe that will help. Then I thought maybe optimising for time and price should be the last stage of development rather than the first. The stages of development mentioned in my previous post will all effect the way this strategy works and the profitability of different inputs. So I think the stages of development need to be completed first. I've noticed the EA is producing OCO orders when the strategy is not meant to enter an OCO order. I've also noticed the trailing stop the EA is using is a trailing profit stop. That is, price needs to move into profit by the quantum of the trailing stop for it to engage. When I conducted my manual backtesting I found that a trailing stop loss which turns into a trailing profit stop was significantly more profitable than a trailing profit stop by itself. That is, a trailing stop which engages immediately when the bid-TSL&gt;SL. Example code below: If TrailingStop &gt; 0 then // if trailing stops are used { If OrderValue(cnt,VAL_STOPLOSS)&lt;(Bid-Point*TrailingStop) then { ModifyOrder(OrderValue(cnt,VAL_TICKET),OrderValue(cnt,VAL_OPENPRICE), Bid-Point*TrailingStop,OrderValue(cnt,VAL_TAKEPROFIT),Red); Exit }; }; After making these changes and completing these stages of development I think we would have a powerfully profitable EA. Mikhail, if your out there, help!!!

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hello, Im sorry I cannot post my code in public because as you know people sell codes like this in ebay. also some people already bought the code from me which would not be fair to them if I post it in the public forum. As for the trailing stop part, you can change that in the EA I posted here. go to the exten vars change "trailingstoptype": 1=After Profit Trailing Stop; 2=Trailing Stop even before profit; 3 Trailing Stop 50% of the profit; Hope you understand and hope that helps, Regards, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #756 ---
hello again Trav , It is very good to see that you are trying to develop the system for it to become robust but I cant help but comment on a few things if you don't mind. The EA I posted here is not a trading system it is just an expert adviser that makes trading the DRS just a little bit easier by automating the task for you. But if you truly want to make a robust trading system out of this strategy, that would be profitable in the long run I suggest you stop looking at fixed levels of entry and exit, It just will not work. The market is dynamic so your system must also be able to change as the market changes. To achieve this in the DRS you have to look at ATR or percentages. An example would be the "SBS EA". its logic is similar to this system but the levels of entry is not fixed. It bases its entry level by calculatuing 70% of yesterday daily range, then thats where it puts its entry levels. and closes all orders at end of the day no tp. Very simple but proves to be profitable. Also if you are able to make a system profitable both in 2005 and 2006, then you would have found your grail, its because 2005 is mostly ranging while 2006 is mostly trending. Just a few suggestions but I encourage you to continue to look at the market and it will reveal itself to you. Regards, Mikhail

try this: note the tokyo closing of the 4 majors usdchf eruusd gbpusd and usdjpy and use this close as starting point for your trading. use an excel spreadsheet where u have marketprice - opening of your ccy. if the usd gets positive against all 4 cceis = long usd market and if the usd gets neg vs the 4 ccies = bear usd market

Thanks for your reply. I appreciate and respect that as a programmer you have the ability and right to comand a fee for your Intellectual Property. As a trader I seek to profit from trading the strategy and hold the belief that the input of many people will create a better strategy than what one person can create. Hence, I would be happy to post the code (like Hendrick has done with Phoenix) and develop the strategy in a forum. Besides, my programming ability is currently very limited so I would need input at some stage. Thanks for the definition of the trailing stop inputs. My attempt to manage risk and capitalise on the dynamics of the market is to turn on/off the trades with higher TP's if they are/aren't likely to be hit. I really like your idea of percentages and will definately research SBS EA. I'm hoping that stage three and four mentioned previously will have the effect of decreasing my positions and size in a non-profitable market and increasing it when it is profitable. I'm not sure whether this is my grail, but I'm quietly confident that this strategy will be profitable. As you said, 2005 is a good testing sample for a directional strategy. My plan will be to see if I can construct an EA from similar ones such as Amazing EA, Straddle EA, Phoenix and SBS EA. I would appreciate any comments or input you are willing to give.

Hi to everyone still left on this very interesting thread. I spent the last 5 hours sorting through this very long thread. I saw things that worked in the beginning and not later on. I think mikhail hit the nail on the head. The market is not constant so your system cannot be. One thing I learned about this market, is that support and resistance levels are constantly changing but do repeat themselves alot also. Mikhail, you stated " It bases its entry level by calculatuing 70% of yesterday daily range, then thats where it puts its entry levels. and closes all orders at end of the day no tp." If you could please explain further on how you calculate the previous daily range and making sure you close at the end of the day with a profit. I have seen many times that a good profit turns into a bad lose all within one day? I would really appreciate the info. that you can give. I want to try the Kamanda trading style, but like you said, the market is not a constant market. Things change thats why you could spend the rest of your life looking at threads and systems that work now but not the following year. I think you have something with that 70% range. PLEASE HELP. LOL. Thank you and take care.

Hello All, If you want further information on the strategy I am referring to PM me your email, I will gladly email to you a very good trading book written by Larry Williams. They based the system I was referring to form one of his strategy in that book that he merely discussed it to illustrate his point, and now we know his point is very profitable Trav I would love for you to read this book I'm sure you would be able to create great systems from the knowledge you would acquire here and I would gladly help you and everyone else in developing a robust system that could conquer the market. Regards, Mikhail

I have found that when backtested, taking profits has drastically decreased the overall profitability of the system. I have also found that filtering out periods of low volatility (defined as ATR(20) &lt; 130PIPS) is non-beneficial. What I have found is that trading this system on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays reduces the trade frequency, and increases profits. The only concern I would have about the system when traded mechanically is that there are looooong flat-times. Possibly adding in some style of counter-term trade would help. Inserted Code Inputs: dollarStop(600), expansionPIPS(.008), DOW1(1), DOW2(2), DOW3(5); vars:longTradesToday(0), shortTradesToday(0), switch(0), buyPrice(0), sellPrice(0), longTrailingExit(0), shortTrailingExit(0); If time crosses above Sess1EndTime then begin longTradesToday = 0; shortTradesToday = 0; buyPrice = close + expansionPIPS; sellPrice = close - expansionPIPS; end; if time &gt; Sess1StartTime and (DayOfWeek(Date) = DOW1 or DayOfWeek(Date) = DOW2 or DayofWeek(date) = DOW3) then begin if longTradesToday = 0 and marketPosition &lt;&gt; 1 then buy("BUY") 1 contract next bar at buyPrice stop; if shortTradesToday = 0 and marketPosition &lt;&gt;-1 then sell("SELL") 1 contract next bar at sellPrice stop; if high crosses above buyPrice then longTradesToday = longTradesToday + 1; if low crosses below sellPrice then shortTradesToday = shortTradesToday + 1; end; setExitOnClose; setStopContract; setStopLoss(dollarStop); Indicator Inserted Code inputs: expansionPIPS(.008); vars:buyPrice(0),sellPrice(0); If time crosses above Sess1EndTime then begin buyPrice = close - expansionPIPS; sellPrice = close + expansionPIPS; end; plot1(buyPrice); plot2(sellPrice); http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/573/erasierky9.jpg

Are those results for the original Micardo system (TP at 30 and 80)? Also what % of equity did you risk on each trade?

--- 帖子 #773 ---
i am just wondering if there is anyone still using this system?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
I have taken the profit target out of the system as it is damaging to the overall backtested results regardless of it's value. I generally disagree with any method of profit target as it has proven to be based on the biases and fears of the trader rather than commonsense ro statistics. You will find that most significant moves can continue in that direction for quite some time. It's a well known market truth that is exploited over and over again. Taking a profit when the market starts to rally is like saying "That's enough money" or "I am afraid that the market will snatch it back, so I will take my profit and run". Really you should be saying: "Gimme more of that"

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Good point Mongoose. Greater success in trading comes when we learn to let profits (at least some of them) run. Conversely, for those who also like a "set it and forget it" strategy, checkout the results at www.daily20pip.com mike
