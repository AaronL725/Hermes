Hello guys a very happy new year to you and I wish you a prosperous and profitable 2019! As its a new year and to new beginnings, I thought its a good idea to reboot the Simple Daily Trend Reversal strategy and start a new thread. The first thread was very successful when it started in 2017, and also in 2018 with over 224 pages, 4463 posts, and over 1.3m views! We had many great developments, and we learned a lot. You can find the first Simple Daily Trend Reversal thread here: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=713593 As there were so many posts, pages, and new developments to the strategy, this new thread will serve as a continuation, also saving most lazy members from reading through the whole thread to be up to date. I will try to post regularly as time allows me, and post valid set ups according to the strategy rules. In 2018 an EA was developed which had initial success, but over a longer period of time, the lack of human intervention and human intuition was its weakness, and it failed to be profitable long term so I have removed it from the thread. I am still open to another EA being created, I do believe its possible for this strategy to be automated successfully, this will be a challenge, but challenges are certainly achievable. Ok here is the strategy rules! This strategy is based off of trading trend reversals. It requires you to be very patient, and calm as confirmed set ups are few, but when there is a confirmed set up it will be profitable most of the time. There are 4 main indicators that are used for this strategy. We will trade mainly on H1 and H4 although D1 time frames can also be traded successfully. It is very important to make sure that all the indicators are in agreement for a confirmation of a trade, if not then it will reduce your probability of success. Setting the SL &amp; TP levels is a personal choice. For me when I do set a SL, I would normally set my SL at the previous swing high or swing low (previous ZigZag Arrow) and, check the pivot levels. I also pay close attention to price action. The TP can either be a fixed target (+50-100 pips depending on time frame traded) or using Fibonacci retractment, ADR %, or when there is a new confirmed opposite signal to get maximum pips. You can also set a trailing stop after a predetermined min amount of pips made, and then move SL to BE etc. I will monitor the price action the majority of the time, and get out if I see the trend is changing, and a new reversal forming. Please see below the trade rules: Rules to buy: A green ZigZag Arrow will appear and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100 only! The Turbo JSRX indicator was/is in the oversold zone (Below the 30% level) and indicating a green uptrend. When the candle crosses, and closes above the 10 EMA up from below, and only if the trade is still confirmed by the 3 indicators. Rules to sell: A red ZigZag Arrow will appear and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, R61, R78, R100 only! The Turbo JSRX indicator was/is in the overbought zone (Above the 70% level) and indicating a red down trend. When the candle crosses, and closes below the 10 EMA down from above, and only if the trade is still confirmed by the 3 indicators. So only when all 3 indicators have confirmed a valid trade, and are all in 100% agreement with each other according to the rules, and the candle crosses, and closes above or below the 10 EMA, an order is validated, and opened. It is also very important to monitor price action. Sometimes there will be a big fast move with the current candle shooting through the EMA, in that case I would not wait for the current candle to close, and I would enter straight away to catch the rest of the move. Do this at your own discretion! This strategy works, and I encourage all of you guys to try this strategy and please share your results with us. I know that this strategy can be very profitable for everyone. For now let us enjoy trading, and collecting more pips from the market! Please only post screenshots of charts using the template provided so as not to confuse anyone. Please be polite and respectful to all members, and lets keep the thread on topic! If you cannot follow these simple guidelines you will be removed. If you have a good idea or proposal that can improve on the strategy post it with an explanation to validate your proposal. Please subscribe to keep updated with all latest developments of this strategy, give your feedback, and lets all enjoy success from this strategy. Green pips to you all, cheers!

Hi MRDFX, thank you for the new thread and the explanation of the strategy, just one question, so far which pairs have been the best for this strategy? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Personally I only trade 15 pairs, all pairs except NZD &amp; CHF, never liked trading them, but feel free to experiment with an pairs you like as it works on basically everything. Some guys from the previous thread had good success trading this strategy with Gold, and indices etc.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for starting this new thread continuing your previous thread, definitely subscribed, be interested to see where this thread goes. Could you please just state exactly what 15 pairs you use with this system?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
AUDCAD, AUDJPY, AUDUSD, CADJPY, EURAUD, EURCAD, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY leaves out AUDCHF, AUDNZD, CADCHF, CHFJPY, EURCHF, EURNZD, GBPCHF, GBPNZD, NZDCAD, NZDCHF, NZDJPY, NZDUSD, USDCHF out of the 7 majors and 21 minors, just my wild guess

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Congrat for starting new threads.Happy new year

--- 帖子 #7 ---
mrdfx Thank sir. You've just mastered that.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes that's correct, all the pairs except NZD, and CHF. Now that's not to say that the strategy doesn't work on NZD and CHF pairs, its just a personal choice for me not to trade them.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Here's a valid signal that came up last night on EU.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hello mrdfx, guys, Happy new year! I use the strategy for some time and its promising. Is there any explanation file for the EA? Some of the inputs are not quite self explanatory? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #11 ---
There is a PDF in the first thread, but the current version has evolved a bit since the developer of the EA created it. You can search the first thread paperclip and download the PDF to get familiar or post your questions here, but I do recommend that you do not trade the EA live, only on demo.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
EU signal is in profit +50 pips.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Everyone!, I made these three trades of which I think that two were valid, but just wanted to get your opinion Valid Trade 1 - GBPAUD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Valid Trade 2 - EURAUD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trade not valid (but I took mistaking the candle) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi mrdfx, I don't understand why the Buy trade of your example in the first post is a valid trade. Price is far from R61,R78 R100 lines Regards

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Looks good halvarado89!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
'Patience exercised'. Because he is taking the buy trade from support i.e. S61, S78 etc.. Sell trades are taken from resistance R61, R78 etc. Read the rules again.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Can someone tell me why trade 3 is not valid? It’s came up from s100, jrsx turns green coming up from 30, and closed above 10ema. Thanks

--- 帖子 #18 ---
My main reason is that the candle is not big enough and it has bigger wicks than the body so it's more like an indecision candle rather than a confirmation one... but I'm new at this so maybe someone else have a better explanation.... and maybe it really was a valid setup and it was just a trade that went south.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I just took a trade, EURCAD 1H Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I’m with you on that one Bro!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
HI MRDFX, i start yesterday the test, this is so far results Attached Image

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I think that it might go south... at the Daily chart, there are two candles that might imply a sell. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Yup valid signal on EC!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
please can you write the settings of all indicators because template is not working well

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi MRDFX, thanks for the new thread. Let me first wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year. I am currently in the “black” with 41.87% for this year already. I trust that I can maintain this momentum with the explanation of the strategy which you narrated. I made some missteps in April and May of 2017. These were due, in part, to my not following the posts in the previous thread sequentially. I paid a very painful, but yet gained a valuable lesson. I shall not “cry over spilt milk.” though. My advice, to fellow traders of the “Simple Daily Trend Reversal Trading System ” is that they should make an effort to read all 224 posts in the previous Thread if they want to reap the benefits of this system. Trust me on this!!! This post is my first contribution to the Thread, and I have subscribed and will continue to be an ardent follower and supporter of this System. It works for me.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Oops ! I meant S61,S78, S100. Price bounce above S38 so why is it a valid buy trade ?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
The arrow indicator do repaint. How do i work around that please?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
By the time the other indicators provide signals for confirmation, the arrow should be settled. From my experience the arrow indicator is usually the first indication of trend, then the other indicators (MA/MBFX/Candle) form confluence a few hours later. So I would ignore any repainting, and wait for it to settle after some time has passed, then look for confluence of other indicators.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Happy new year and thanks for starting this new thread. You have a nice system here and experts in the house should kindly help to created a dashboard like the image below, which will help in easy analysis of all pairs.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
EC signal hit my SL.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
What do you mean the template is not working well?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
You can use the current version of the EA to do something similar. Load the EA on the chart and set allow trading = false in the settings, then set up the alerts so when there is a new signal you can confirm it first and then open manually. This is the best solution for catching signals on all pairs.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Bros, you got it wrong. All I am trying to say is that with dashboard, just like the image attached in that post, one can easily see when all 4 indicators agreed or lined up, thereby saving us the time to check many pairs.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I will look at it and set it up following your help above. I never knew it had alerts, that is very interesting, thank you

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Very similar.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Yes, you are right. Please, how can I make the 28 pairs visible, cause I see only 7 pairs and when I check 'tradepairs' all 28 pairs where listed.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The dashboard will only show pairs that have any one of the valid criteria, if not then it won't display.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks for the clarification and have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks for the above. Finally, how do i now factor in the support, pivot and resistance levels with other indicators?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Please read the rules on first post.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Oh, thank you mrdfx for replying me personally. "The price will hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100." The above quote from the set rules is where where my problem is coming from, can seem to properly interpret it. I've seen where prices are at different support/resistance levels after the full cornfirmation of other indicators, yet some trades were good, some were bad. what is the major relationship of price and S61, S78 and S100 that we should firmly consider when taking the trades? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
nice to see you updating the strategy again Mrdfx.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
In this strategy we use the weekly pivot levels as S&amp;R levels and wait for price to enter these levels or zones to pre qualify a potential set up. So for example when the ZigZag arrow appears in a pivot level zone of either 61, 78 or 100 we will look for the rest of the indicators to give confirmation. We don't look at the PP, pivot level S/R38 and pivot levels over S/R100. To be clear the the pivot level zone is the area above and below the pivot level. For me this is max 25 pips on either side, so meaning if the candle comes within this zone it is a valid S&amp;R level.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hello Brother, Do you have this kind of scanning indicator with you... Do you mind to share ?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks, I look forward to the progress of this thread.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
mrdfx just found this thread thanks for sharing im subscribed. where can one find the dashboard thanks

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello, if you look at zone 61, 78 or 100 why the buy trade in the image you put in the first post is a valid trade ? Regards

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Happy Monday guys! So the wife and I are going away for a much needed vacation so I won't be trading this week. Please feel free to share your set ups and valid trades while I'm away! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
You have asked this question 3 times even after someone else replied to you. The image in first post is for an example of a valid trade with the indicators. The pivot cannot be seen for the buy order and I wanted to fit both examples in 1 image.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi everyone! I just took this trade in UC and I wanted to know if it was a valid setup... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Green pips my friends!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I'm newbie here. But according to the rule in 1st page I think its fulfill the rule

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Also here are the pairs that I'm following closely, I think that they might provide a valid setup in the next days. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi, UC is usually used as abbreviation for USD/CAD. Actually great set up but most people don't trade CHF pairs (different reasons). And also most of the pairs that you monitor include CAD so if you take all the trades than you'll be heavily CAD exposed.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi All, New to the thread and excited to be here! A quick question.... we are looking for price to be in the 61, 78 or 100 zone to be valid signal, but mrdfx made a comment at post 43 above that makes me ask: is it where the price is when the zigzag arrow appears or where price is when it crosses the MA?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I think your meant to be looking for a confluence of all the factors you mentioned, price to hit either the 61, 78, 100 pivot zones, a ZigZag arrow to appear by price, the Turbo JSRX indicator to be either overbought or oversold, and price to cross the MA for the trigger.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi, thanks for the response. I understand what you are saying but one of the requirements for a valid signal is that price be in 61, 78 or 100 zone but I can see a scenario where price is IN the zone when the zigzag arrow appears and OUT of the zone when it crosses the MA. As it is a prerequisite for a valid signal, I wanted to get it right Hopefully this makes sense. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
You want MRDFX the thread admin to double confirm, but I think that as long as you have price in the pivot zones, the ZigZag arrow by price and the Turbo JSRX indicator overbought or oversold, its OK if price then moves out of the pivot zones when it crosses the MA, if price is around the 61 pivot zone the cross will probably always occur just outside the zone. Wait for the admin of the thread to give his opinion on your question though, he knows best since its his system.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Cheers, thanks

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi , mrdfx Hppy New year, First of all I say thank you so much for your wonderful sharing about your great forex system, I read all your last thread about this system. Now I am here with you. I am sure that I will learn more and more from You. Thank You , Kind Regards,

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I am in on C/J and U/C now based on the rules.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Anyone looking at USD/CAD at the moment?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi, nice thread, After tried many EA and also coding EA myself with no success, I come back to manual trading again and I'm trying this system on h4 with the addition of some currency strength indicator because I think following currency strength and weakness is always veriy important. I tried in the past some manual trading system but after some loss I gave up and switched to another system, and I repeat again switching systems and this I think it's a big mistake. Now I want to focus on this system and try for a longer time hoping for a success, thanks again for your thread and happy pips to all. Next I will post some charts to discuss with you how to improve and better learn this great system. In the mean time I would like to know if someone had success trading this system for long time.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I think that the UC and AU might provide valid setups

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi all, thanks for the great idea. I have a technical questions. 1. In order to see the Dashboard where all the opportunities are shown, do we apply this EA on each chart? Or we just put it on one chart and it show all pairs that are mentioned in setting? 2. Does anyone get the alerts when the conditions are reached? Please let me know. Thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
EU shows good setup for short.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi, when trading h1 tf do you use daily pivot instead of weekly pivot ? because the ea is alerting usdjpy buy entry but in the usdjpy chart the arrow is far away from s61,s78,s100 weekly pivot level Attached Image (click to enlarge) instead after switching to daily pivot Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Does the dashboard alert when it hits s61 and r61 areas?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Only use weekly pivot. Make sure Pivot is Support/Resistance setting is set to false.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thanks I will check it

--- 帖子 #70 ---
short on CADCHF, let's see how it goes Attached Image (click to enlarge)

short on NZDUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) CADCHF at +13, SL moved to BE Edit: Closed NZDUSD at BE (got lucky there) Closed CADCHF at +24 pips (weekend ahead)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
NU has a good setup for short. I am a bit more conservative and wait for price to cross the MA on H4 instead of H1.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
nzdusd +13.62 % LONG by consumers, so as this index is a contrarian indicator it should be good selling nzdusd Attached Image (click to enlarge) and on currency meter usd is a little strength than nzd, not too much difference now. Attached Image do we wait ??? in the meantime my cadchf sell +20, cadjpy sell +8

--- 帖子 #75 ---
good call. i was able to close the position at BE before the weekend

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Mrdfx, thanks for your great system and effort. A question regarding the EA (I use for alerts only). If I wish to try to trade this on 30 mins TF (and hence get alerts when the 30 min candles closes), shall I put the EA on a 30 m. TF or change from 15 min to 30 min in the EA (or both)? Thanks for any help, PC

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Also have the same doubt, I put both, the EA on h4 tf chart and signal parameter on h4 too.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Where did you get the contrarian info from? Thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks! Do you find it accurate?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Don't know I'm trying, let's see

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Sir, Some people dont use their brain, actually he is analysing everything on image instead to use the strategy practically. BTW many thanks for your time to this valuable thread, I would suggest incorporate RSI or CCI for more accuracy to the system,

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi there I get a lot of false signals using the EA v. 1.20 (for alerts only) - the signals I get are not within 25 pips of the Pivots - anybody else experience this? Thanks in advance for any input. PC

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Very often it enters trades from the weekly pivot but most of them are quite successful. Some results from previous week. (on demo)

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I think you should consider not the current price distance from the pivots, but the last 10 candle distance from the pivots that is the setting of Signal Lookback(bars) in the ea. So within last 10 bars there is one that has a distance of max 25 pips ? if yes the condition is satisfied. You can lower the Signal Lookback(bars) if you want.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks! Great results - default settings or? PC

--- 帖子 #87 ---
This settings for the moment. The results from previous week is kind of "lucky strike" it's not always like this

--- 帖子 #88 ---
sorry I can't attach the set file

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Anybody going short on CAD/JPY?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Yes, I have short positions open on the pair....

--- 帖子 #91 ---
i have short positions since last week at R61

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hello guys I am back from my vacation, it was great to spend some time on the beach with my wife, a well deserved break! I will read back and catch up with all the posts.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
hi, the hard part is to identify when it's a real reversal and when it's only a pullback and after it trend will resume on its direction, so if you enter on pullback you can grab some pips counter-trend but then you should close quickly before trend will resume on its original direction.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
It is hard to identify reversals vs pullbacks and there isn't a system or strategy that will ALWAYS work, otherwise we would all sit on an island in the Bahamas sipping cocktails and lazing our days through (can you picture it - nice hey!) What I do, I pay particular attention to where price is in relation to the pivots. I will not trade for a reversal if the opening price is not on or beyond R/S61. I also look at PA and if there is no PA confirmation of a reversal I wait for price to open at or beyond R/S78. Also, I only work on H4 time frame and I wait for price to cross and close beyond the EMA on this time frame - sure you could miss out on 20 -40 pips but I find it more reliable indication. Sometimes I enter a trade before price crosses of EMA but I will ony do this if certain PA criteria are met.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks

Hello we are looking for the ZigZag to go into the pivot zone not the MA cross.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
You only need to load the EA on 1 chart on the time frame which you want to trade. Make sure you have all the pairs showing in your market watch so the EA can see them.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hello pipcruiser yes you will load the EA on the M30 chart if you want to trade the 30 mins time frame.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
How would you incorporate RSI or CCI to improve on the strategy accuracy?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I hope you are not trading the EA on auto unless its on demo? Its always wise to check and confirm the signal from the EA before opening a position as I have recommended on first post.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Anybody still holding on to a short on CAD/JPY? Also, are there any good trade exits people use with this system?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I can't see any valid sell on CY?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Its was last week on the 8th

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Ah ok I see it. As for exits I did give some suggestions on the first post. Personally I look at ADR % for TP as each pair moves differently and having a fixed TP doesn't work for all pairs.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
ADR right ? Not ATR? If you mean ADR can you suggest some good indicator?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
This is the ADR indicator I use. I follow a 20 day ADR period.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
So you use the 20 day ADR to set your TP, is it the whole number or do you use a percentage, 50%, 75%??

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I am using it more or less the same way the ADR TS is set up in the set file for the EA. When the price reaches 25% ADR in profit move SL to BE, when it reaches 50% move SL to 25%, when it reaches 75% move SL to 50% and when it reaches 100% ADR move SL to 75% etc. This is not set in stone and you need to monitor the price and strength of each pair. For example on a slow moving low ADR pair, and to allow more breathing room, in some cases its better to only move to BE when 50% ADR is hit.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Subs. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks! PC

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I just use it for alerting, checking manually PC

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thanks, do you think we can use the same adr value of 20day for trading H4 tf too or maybe should we use a multiplier of this value ? because I trade also the H4 tf, I see the value of this ADR indicator does not change switching the tf, for example now I see 85 value as 20day on h4 tf, so the 100% TP would be 85 pips on H4 tf, as well on H1.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Short on AUDCHF and NZDCHF Both entries had the turbo below 70 (that one is violating the rules..). Turbo on H4 above 70. Close below 10ma. ZigZag in 25 Pips range to R61. lets see how it goes. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Update 1: Closed NZDCHF for +29.5 Pips. Move from zigzag to TP was around 20 Days ADR. Pivot Point and previous consolidation ahead. AUDCHF still going. Currently at +13 Update 2: Closed AUDCHF for +15.4 Pips. Cant keep checking the charts for the rest of the day, so i take some pips and run with them

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Watching EURGBP. Not so sure about trading GBP right now. Thinking about waiting for a close above 10ma on H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Update: Seems like the 10ma saved the day

Hello can you share your template with the indicators? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #113 ---
hello there, i am not sure if i am allowed to share the indicators. But you can find them on the first post from mrdfx. The symbol selector is from the mt4 marketplace (for free).

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Is there any dashboard for the valid setups? I cannot find any in the paper clip. If there is could you please post it here.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
ADR has nothing to do with TF, ADR is the average daily movement in pips irrespective of the time frame.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
It looks like the Turbo JSRX indicator on your chart is not set up correctly. Make sure the Len input is 7 not 14.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yes I supposed that, so trading on H4 tf shall we use the same 20day period ADR? or is it too short?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Oh yes, you are correct. I will give the new setting a try!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I think you are confusing the use of ADR and TF. How many pips a pair moves in a day is not related to the time period you are monitoring or trading. One can use any ADR period, personally I prefer a 20 day, but some prefer 5 day, 10 day even 50 day ADR. Whether you are trading on H1, H4 or even D1 TF, if a pair moves +80 pips it will move +80 pips on all time frames you trading so its irrespective of the TF.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
yes I know that the ADR is the same but if I trade on H4 or Daily TF it's supposed that my orders stay opened longer because my sl and tp are wider based on H4, D1 Open\Close\High\Low Candles, so maybe an average weekly range could be better on H4, D1, or better to use another type of trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Feel free to explore and experiment with whichever exit strategy suits your trading better using this strategy, I did list some options on the first post.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Valid buy on EG. I'm a bit cautious of trading any GBP pairs currently so I'll be monitoring this trade closely.

Hi i am trying your EA but its all get SL, it will be fun if the strategy work but it is not. I see all entries are against the EMA and parabolic sar. I hope you can have more update that work like a charm, thanks bro.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hmm you are very vague in your statement as I don't know how you have been using the EA, perhaps you have not been using it correctly. You mention EMA? What EMA? If you going to comment negatively then at least back up your comment so I can answer constructively and give you advice. Also do your research before saying my strategy does not work!

I am assuming you closed your trade as soon as green arrow appeared on EC ? May I ask where was your SL ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I was wondering how often do you get signals - once a week perhaps ? Also I would love to backtest it would the indicators work in standard MT4 tester ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Dear, please don't misunderstood, i just report to you try to run the EA and it went SL, i don't change any setting just default and i marked as Simply Daily for the entry. I am attached the results so may be you can help. Sorry i don't mean to negatively criticize your work, just report the result.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
It is either me or my arrows have opposite colours ? Was it supposed to be like this ? It was a valid buy signal on EC and my arrow was up but RED and vice versa my valid sell signals show up in GREEN :-) Any idea ?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Try this version of the indicator - should fix your problem.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Not necessarily as when a opposite arrow appears the price can move quite a bit more and if you close as soon as an opposite arrow appears you could miss out on pips. SL can be set at previous swing high/low or using pivot levels or ADR %, its up to you and the threshold/breathing room you want to have on open positions. Personally I'll look at the swing high/low and ADR %.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
It depends on the market conditions how many signals we can get in a week, but based on previous data and on trading all 28 pairs we can expect between 70-100 signals per month. Yes you can back test the indicators I think.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
The default settings are not optimized and I did upload my preset on post 1 which has better results.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
done it still same. I could probably change the colour order but this glitch makes me wonder are the other indicators are correct. Hmm

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thats quite a lot, I was expecting far less then this. cheers

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Are you using the same indicators and template from post 1? You can also switch the colors in the indicator settings to get them to display correctly.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
If that's a lot you can remove some pairs an also trade on H4 instead of H1 which will reduce the amount of signals.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
YEs all indis from P1 I will just change the colours :-)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
SL hit on EG. -78 pips. I was cautious about trading GBP and the pound is strong today so lesson learned, no trading GBP pairs!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Nah its fine, unless H4 gives less fakes, I was just referring to what you wrote on Page 1 "It requires you to be very patient " that's why I was expecting a lot less signals :-) 1 more question. - Arrow appears usually a lot earlier the the closing candle above or below the 10 EMA. Lets say by the time the candle closes below/above the 10 EMA it is not in the 61,78 or 100 zone - is it still valid trade ?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
For some of you this question might sound fanny but it is co confusing. Could you please look at the picture and tell me what is Zone 1 and Zone 2 ?? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
How about you share with us how you do it so we wont have to bother you with our signals

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Yeah right - whatever!!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Correct me if I am wrong but as soon as the candle closees below EMA we have a GO ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #142 ---
My first entry using this system. Live account.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I managed to open 2 more positions. I hope it was valid entries :-) I am bit experimenting with TP and SL at the moment. Will let you know how it works out for me :-)

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Lots of set ups on GBP pairs. If you don't mind to be exposed to GBP of course. I opened additional 3 trades with correct set up. They all going in green pip directions at the moment. GBP is going down after recent up.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
i am also short on GBPCAD, GBPNZD and GBPJPY. Lets see how it goes

--- 帖子 #162 ---
My biggest problem as always is to when take the profit. At certain moment I was 10% up. But it was only 20-30 pips on all 4 opened positions. Greed took over and i am holdin currently at 7.5% up. After hiting 25pups profit i moved them to BE I will let it run swe whathappens

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Update: Got stopped out on all my trailing stops, had them set up for 25pip each. Looks like it was not a great idea because market retraced from my stops and went back into profit. Note to myself. No Trailing stops next time. Ps. Still gained 4.01% so not to bad... Thanks MRdfx for sharing this system

--- 帖子 #164 ---
EG is not valid as it is passed the S100 level. Most times when prices passes S/R100 it indicates a strong trend, trading past S/R100 is high risk. UC is valid although it seems to be stuck in range but I do think it is on the way down as the bulls can't seem to push through the 9947 level. EA is valid.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
New valid sell signal on UJ.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks for sharing the signal, This and EA are strong signal

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thanks for the tip. Did not know about past lvl 100

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I am looking for good and reliable break even EA. Could you recomm3nd something ?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
closed all three positions for a total gain of +166 pips . (Weekend ahead) have a nice weekend everyone!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Nice score. I should not play with the trailing stops. I got maybe 50pips :-) Either way can't complain.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Man I new I should finisjh after 4% for today. I promised myself not to trade anymore, saw your comment and entered the trade. 1 hout later got stopped on SL. UJ was not kind for me today. I did not check the news - there was a lot of orange and other news for USD around 15:00 GMT. Now I am looking for good News indie to put on dashboard.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Is that a way to have EA that follow this criteria ? I run h1 and h4 and hit SL, live to see this ea work.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hello traders This is my first post here I am Mohammed from Egypt. I hope to be a good guest to you This shart .... four hours Can that opportunity be adopted with the opening of the market

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Mrdfx From my tests the SDTR pivots EA 4hr on default set is still doing a great job.... I have left the EA with no intervention from 13/11/18 to date and it's showing good results, also it's currently in positive pips - see below. I kept the EA on through the recent Christmas/New Year period out of curiosity and it did suffer a few consecutive losses but this is easily rectified by turning it off in holiday periods as you would have done on a live account. Will keep testing but looking good so far... Cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I think the EA needs manual intervention according to the old thread since it can be profitable in certain periods and unprofitable in bad periods.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Agree it would probably improve results if you can manually intervene. However at the moment as an indication if you are looking of a set and forget system it is currently doing ok - up 1900 pips in 2 months and would have been more if it was disabled over the 2 week Christmas/New Year period. Could obviously change in the future though as with any system......

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello Carlos Is the above dashboard created by the EA or is it a separate Indicator? And whichever it is could you post it here.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
In order to familiarise myself with this system and to have a rough idea what to expect I becktested it on 99,9% modelling using Tickstory lite and MT4. Something strange happened. As soon as currency pair (EURUSD) starts heavily trending down the market goes way below ZONE S200 and it trends beyond it for weeks. I have noticed if I refresh the indicator by reapplying the template again the market is within zones again. If i try to enter on the (what I think it is)valid signal i Lose each time because the pair is trending down. My question is what happens if I restart the MT4 will the indicators be showing it correctly or perhaps it is just the tester problem ? If I would not refresh the indicators in the MT4 tester the pair would never go back to the tradable zones S100-61. Please see the screenshots to demonstrate my problem.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I would like to also ask is it ok to add extra indicators to the template, I was thinking about news indicator (so I will never forget to check it). I am not sure is this correct but I have been told sometimes adding extra indicators to already custom made ones can compromise them. Thanks

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I use it and share my opinion

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi howard, the dashboard is part of the EA when you install it and the EA and 4hr set file are all posted in previous pages of this thread

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi it is me again. Is this normal, that after MT4 restart all the charts (in terms where the market is) look almost same. I mean the price is either above or below the yellow PP line. I don't want to trade on wrong charts. Please see example below.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Going long (buy limit order not triggered yet) on NZDCAD. Price was in 25 pips range of S61 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also short on AUDNZD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I would be cautious of trading pivot levels past S/R100. The key pivot levels we look for are 61, 78, 100.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Awesome results Carlos!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Yes you can add other indicators if you like, but I only ask when you post screenshots that they are the same as the template.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Still holding this trade from last week guys, currently in DD of -27 pips.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Going short on EURCHF, valid signal Attached Image (click to enlarge) still holding both positions, they aren't really going anywhere ... Update: Stopped out at BE+1

--- 帖子 #189 ---
hello mrdfx, i have a question regarding pivots and the 0-25 pips range. What are you doing if the difference between the R38 and R61 is lower than 25pips. If all of the other entry criteria are met, do you still consider it a valid signal, even if the reversal happens at (or maybe even below) the R38? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
they are not going anywhere as the Big Boys in America have Bank Holiday today. I am also in AUDNZD. How come the EURCHF is valid signal - shouldn't it be 25 pips away from the R38 line ? or perhaps I don't understand the rules ?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
If i am not mistaken, the price has to be "in the zone" around the R61 (or above) line. From the 1st page: "The price will hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, R61, R78, R100." EURCHF was only 7 pips away from the R61 line. Pleace correct me if i am misinterpreting something.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
We are always looking at the S/R61, 78 and 100 zones so we want to see the price come within those zones. Sometimes if the previous week price action was very low for a certain pair the new pivots might be spaced closely together but we never look to trade off the S/R38 pivot level. Yes this is correct as I've mentioned in previous posts the pivot zone is the area above and below the pivot line. In most cases the price will rarely hit the pivot line exact, and rather go into the 'zone'. I say 0-25 pips, so that's around 10-12 pips max on both sides of the pivot line creating a kind of zone where we look for price to start reversing.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Got an alert for a buy on AU, but I am not taking the trade just yet. PA is very slow today with the US bank holiday, and overall it looks like the trend is still bearish on H4 so I will continue to monitor it and enter when I have more confident confirmation.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thank you very much for this explanation

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yeah that clears a lot.

Hello mrdfx, first off all, thanks for this tread. i like it.. btw, i wanna ask you about your EA. i use EA only for alert not for auto trading. why alert not refreshed? i mean, after i close and reopen MT4, alert thumb is display... but if MT4 not close and reopen, alert not display. thanks, AnakKostan.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Closed AUDNZD for +21pips . Price reversed at the PP. Closed NZDCAD for +5pips. Turbo shows an incoming reversal. Additionaly i am not confident regarding the price action

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Regarding NC, possible red news for NZD tomorrow and CDN doing much better cuz of oil. Short is better bet imho

--- 帖子 #200 ---
It currently seems like i should have stayed in a little longer. Oh well, still a small profit

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Mrdfx, thank you for opening this new thread. I like this Idea of trading and going to stick to it. Question is tho, AU on your chart was around S38. Why do you consider it as good signal? Thank you for clarification.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hello Mrdfx, thank you for sharing your system. I've been reading the original thread and If I'm not wrong there are some changes or updates to the system: On the original post you say the recommended TF is 4h, now you recommend the 1h. You added the pivot levels to the strategy. Am I right? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I am watching closely AUDUSD and USDCAD. Not seeing anything else worth watching atm. Price action looks promising on them 2 :-) Will see.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Same on my end. Especially USDCAD looks spicy .

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I made a mistake yesterday and close the AUDNZD with only 6 pips profit. Should I hold till this morning I would get 30 :-( But it was not moving at all so I have rather close it then wake up with SL hit :-)

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Is it possible for ebeckers to release the source for the EA? I looked in the repository and couldn't find the pivot levels code. https://github.com/erwin-beckers/SimpleTrendReversalEA

--- 帖子 #207 ---
currently short on EC, Attached Image (click to enlarge) let's see....

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I've sold USDCAD. I know the candle is not closed yet but it was very nice move down after move up and I would not wont to lose by waiting longer.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Long on NZDUSD, candle is not closed yet, but there was a strong movement north Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also short on USDCAD, same es NZDUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
As far as I am aware the alerts function is working properly. Is anyone else having issues with the EA alerts?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
If you look at the candles, even though it looks close to S38 the previous candles came into the S61 zone so technically it was valid. I did mention that I did not like the PA and did not enter which looking at now was a good decision.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yes you are correct there were updates to the strategy. I suggest you read the last 15 pages of the old thread to catch up on all the new developments to the original strategy.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
ebeckers did not create the current EA version we are using now, FxMadness added the pivot code and a few other things. ebeckers was helping to add new functions to the EA for me but he lost interest and disappeared and thankfully FxMadness helped me out as I can't code for shit lol. I'm still open to someone creating an EA or manual dashboard if they want to.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
We are together in both of this trades. I have a really bad feeling about them 2 :-)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
USDCAD not looking to good right now. As it turns out, the candle didn't close below the 10ma NZDUSD is now a valid signal

--- 帖子 #216 ---
just got hit on SL on USDCAD. Lesson learn. Wait for all 3 signals unless the PA move is huge :-)

--- 帖子 #217 ---
yep, lesson learned

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hello mrdfx, Hi mrdfx, thanks for answer.. btw, is that only in MT4 show 1 pair with EA and close all of pair? because i open all pair + 2 for EA ( 1H and 4H).... Regards,

--- 帖子 #219 ---
are we gonna fall for USDCAD again ?? lol

--- 帖子 #220 ---
i'll be waiting for a full confirmation. The H4 is also showing signs for overbought conditions.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I am long on this pair atm. I would wait for price to CLOSE below 10 EMA on H4 before going short here.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
It looks like I missed a good buy opportunity on EU. Is anyone on it?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Closed this trade for +22 pips. I'm not liking the PA so I got out.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I missed it but I managed to take all the crappy ones :-)

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I missed it too. I am currently still watching USDCAD, it already got 3 times near the R100. GBPAUD and GBPCAD are also quite interesting, both testing the R61.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Quick update I took 2 trades yesterday: 1 - USDCAD. Looked really sweet, I've anticipated the cross and entered the trade without cross confirmation. Cross did not happened trade went against me and I've lost -4.95% of my account 2 - NZDUSD. Entered according to the rules. Was ranging and NZD rallied after the news. I was bit lucky on this trade and before I was not sure how it will unfold I exited it with the profit of 6.35% of my account. So overall +1.4% for the day. Not bad, but the lesson was learned today and will definitely not enter the trade before the cross unless the PA move is huge. Please note I play on very small live account and very aggressively (I risk 5% each trade) Please don't do it at home :-) Green pips people. Ps. Note to myself - work on exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
i think USDCAD valid for sell?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
First try, a bit late sell USDCAD

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Me to, took it at the same time. lets hope!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I was bit to late for USDCAD but I entered GBPAUD. GBP is never stable around this time but I took a risk. I was hesitating a bit because of the news at 9:30 (MPC member speaks) but on the end decided to take it.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
bro, i think you should watch your turbo_jrsx indicator... Regards,

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Currently watching NZDCHF and AUDNZD, both near a 78 level Unfortunatly i was asleep while USDCAD formed a setup. EURCHF is also interesting, seems like it's forming a double top. It's around 12 pips away from R61. ZigZag is at first test of R61... Let's hope that GBPAUD is also forming a double top, that could be a nice setup as well

--- 帖子 #233 ---
And my SL was hit on GBPAUD I think I will approach this currency with more caution next time.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
It looks like I missed a good trade on UC last night! Good to see that some of you caught it. With so much volatility around GBP I am staying away from all GBP pairs for now, its just not worth the risk. A trade might be valid technically but all it takes is some fundamental news to turn a trade upside down like we seen on GA. So no trading CHF, NZD and GBP pairs for me. Trade carefully guys!

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello guys and sorry to ask this newbie question but i can't seem to able to add any of the indicators or the Ea into my mt4. I tried opening the show package content and inserting into the expert and the indicator side but its doesn't work. I'm also on a mac. Any help would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I think I understand your aproach more and more. I suffer from trade hunger I need to apply strategy less is more :-) i will no longer trade chf and nzd and stary gbp after march this year

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I use Mac, running MT4 on Mac is slightly different and installation of indicators and EA's is also different but I'll show you. Firstly I suggest you download the MT4 program from your broker then install the downloaded .dmg file into your Mac. To install EA's and indicators on Mac: 1. For EA's copy the indicator .ex4 files. Make sure your MT4 is closed. 2. Click on Applications and scroll down to "open in finder” 3. Go to your MT4 App, right click and click "show package contents" 4. Click on "drive_c" &gt; program files &gt; MT4 &gt; MQL4 &gt; Indicators. 5. Copy the indicator .ex4 files and paste in indicators folder. 6. For EA's do the same but copy and paste the EA .ex4 file into the Expert Advisor folder. 7. Now open MT4 and you will find the indicators under the Navigator tab under Indicators an the EA's in the Expert Advisor folder.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I don't have the MAC myself but from brief look here: https://mtrading.com/trading-platfor...r-4/for-mac-os it looks like it can be done with few easy steps. Have a read.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Many traders focus on quantity rather than quality, you can make more money on fewer quality trades. I understand that most traders always want to be in the market trading as many set ups as they can find, but most often this leads to more losses. By only looking for high quality set ups we reduce the quantity of trades which actually leads to better results overall. I'm a full time trader and one of the biggest things I had to learn was having patience waiting for a valid quality set up, before that I used to scan all the charts continuously searching for something to trade and many times due to impatience and greed I lost more than I made. Now days its different, in the morning I scan for set ups and wait for confirmation, kind of like waiting for the market to come to me. If there's nothing valid I don't trade. Not trading CHF &amp; NZD pairs is a personal choice, I just don't like them from my own experience so for me its better to stay away, but for many other traders they have no problems trading those pairs.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Just taken this trade, i beleive it to be following the rules but feel free to let me know if I am wrong.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Price did not cross EMA

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I am watching closely AUDUSD it is going strong to retest again S78 zone.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
This is not a valid trade, please read the strategy rules on page 1.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thanks for the insight. I think my biggest problem is to let profits run. Did you have any similar problems in your beginning? Was there some "Aha" moment ? I am trading a very similar strategy (TDI instead of turbo, but the signals are pretty much the same. Turbo is much easier to read though) for ~4 months now and the results are very promising. But alot of times i am closing positions to early, because i loose confidence halfway through.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thank you mrdfx and Forbas for the prompt reply and insight, I have re read page one and understand where i went wrong.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I have a question. Lets say the price on attached picture did closed above EMA. Would this be a valid re-entry ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hello mrdfx, how are you? update for yesterday question about alert on EA , after check allow DLL imports this EA alert now update every minutes. but i still confused, if i comparing alert on EA with manual chart still different. may i ask your setting on EA? this my setting for EA. Regards, AnakKostan

--- 帖子 #248 ---
usdchf taken on 1 hour chart and then over to the H4 chart to follow progress.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi anakkostan you have edited many of the EA settings so its hard to say what you mean. I suggest you use the set file posted on page 1.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Good catch!

Hi mrdfx, thanks for your answer. i have download from page 1. please correct me if i wrong sir, - if EA want to add EMA10 the setting is : UseSMA15 = True MovingAveragePeriode = 10 MovingAverageType = 1 - if TF 4H, the setting is : SignalTimeframe = 4 Hour - if TF 1H, the setting is : SignalTimeframe = 1 Hour Regards,

--- 帖子 #257 ---
A lot happened during Asian session (I was sleeping) There was few deals to catch but I missed it. As promised myself I am not looking into GBP pairs at the moment. I didn't exclude the CHF and NZD pairs, I am still watching them but the PA on confirmed signals will have to be very good for me to enter. From the rest I am watching, for me only EURAUD has a potential. I will wait for the close below EMA and go short. I find it very difficult to watch this pairs and not enter. I almost entered 1 GBP pair but stayed strong and didn't do it, which was a good decision as price just stopped and I would be doubting my decision again. Green pips people

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Just entered EURAUD EDIT: Hehe forgot to check the news before entered and as usual there is red news for EUR in 2h40m will monitor the trade and probably exit the trade if there will be profit before the news.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Just entered AUDCAD valid signal strong PA

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Yes that's correct.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
One important thing to take note of is high impact news events. As this strategy is based on TA, it is still susceptible to HIN events. When there is a new valid signal its always wise to be aware of any upcoming HIN that could impact your position and if you do open any orders to put protective measures in place.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Opened a sell on UC. This is a good entry as there are multiple rejections at the R100 zone.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
dear mrdfx, oke thanks sir. lets try.. Regards,

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Update on my trades. My EURAUD initially went against me. I had big stop loss just above the top of the swing high so was not worry about it. Itwent to -40 pisp. after that it started gaining pips my direction. I was monitoring the trade all the time. Went the things started looking really sweet (I was 30 pips in profit) I thought I am the PRO TRADER :-) haha - I moved the SL to BE. When I got to 40 pips profit I thought my 50 pips target is so real and then things started going terribly wrong. The pair started going up (against me) and before I knew It hit my BE. I should really leave it there, accept the fact that: 1. I had no clue here to take profit and 2. Greed won as I was really thinking to take this +40 pips and call it a day. Instead accept it, because I am very new to live trading I made rookie mistake and tried to prove to the market that I know better :-) I sold again from where it hit my stop loss thinking it will go down again. As you can imagine or check on charts now Market new better and I lost again. I am not very proud of my today's "gambling" so I thought I share it here with you because showing only winners is so.... not statistically correct :-) But thats all part of learning for me. I will try to remember how I felt today when I lost 2 times in a row. ! to greed and lack of knowledge and another time because of the pride and stupidity and when I will next time want to make spmething stupid like this I will remind myself that feeling. Ps. What is your TP strategy. How do you determine your R:R within this strategy. When would you cut your losses ? Please share this info so people like me and others could potentially make less mistakes :-) Ps2. It sounded like ?I lost thousands - no it was only few dollars. I am still in business :-) Ps3. Should I not move my SL in a first place and stay in a trade till now I would have my 50 pips probably now. Ps.4 My AUDCAD hit SL with less drama then EURAUD. Green pips people.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Missed some nice opportunities because i overslept. The GBP pairs are looking pretty good so far

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Seems I missed some good set ups through the night and early morning. This is one of the main reasons why I wanted an EA created of this strategy, so that it would catch these signals and trade them while I'm sleeping. Due to my location by the time that I wake up I have already missed half of LO and a lot of movement. Well on a good note my UC trade is still active and +15 pips and holding.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hello and congratulations on your job I wanted to ask how can I set up the EA to work only for one exchange rate every time I choose? Specifically , a transaction at a time and only for it excgange rate. Thank you

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Nice drop on UC! +45 pips.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
What make you to hold to it that long ? When would you plan to exit pls ?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Still dropping! +88 pips. I'll start monitoring this and most likely close before market closes today, no holding over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I was looking at today's general USD weakness and CAD strength, plus I did not see any support nearby so it was good confirmation of more room to fall.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Position closed for +85 pips. Reason for closing, its near end of the week and things are slowing down, 20 day ADR is hugely overextended at +176%, and I noticed a pullback on S38. Have a good weekend guys.

Can you please tell me how was you able to move out the chart from the background? When I put EA on the chart it is always visible on the background. What did you do in settings to make it go away? Thanks

Hi mrdfx. Can you explain the logic behind of the zig zag indicator? I mean, how the signals are generated?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
No I'm not earning all my trading income from this strategy, I do use other systems/EA's as a kind of portfolio, and together I make my income.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Jordi the logic behind the ZigZag? The ZigZag indicator is only used to give the first hint of a potential reversal forming, and as this strategy is a reversal strategy it is an important part of the strategy.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thank you mrdfx for your answers. I have your template loaded and I'm just observing how it works, and it looks good. A good buy today, on USDCAD

In profit?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
No MT4 only.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Yup I also see it. Things tend to pick up from Tuesday/Wednesday, cos as we are dealing with weekly pivots we need to wait for some market movement for prices to start reaching their pivots.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Looks like EUR sentiment is weakening so this might be a good call to short EU apart from the strategy that shows rejection of R61 pivot level.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Sold EU. This is a classic example of a good valid signal.

Hi valseva, Your results look good so far, it seems like you are using it on 1HR instead of 4HR and also using v1.25 in one picture and 1.20 in the other. Can you post our set file, I have been running test in 4HR for last few days and wouldn't mind being most up to date with the newest versions Cheers!

So ist the EA even using the same strategy? Looking at the signals it seems like it doesnt: Attached Image It shows EURNZD as a valid signal. But looking at the chart, the last ZigZag is not anywhere near a valid support or resistance level: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Sold AU. AU looks good with multiple rejections around the 7200 zone. So to update I am holding EU sell and now also AU sell. Later is FOMC so I will be monitoring closely and set my SL in case.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
You are not making use of the pivot filter in the EA so it is not using pivots as a entry criteria.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
i am also short on AUDUSD. Still holding EURUSD, got rejected a second time at R61, so i am still confident

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Ok got it, i thought that the "Pivot is Support / Resistance" option takes care of that. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
So i think that my EA configuration is working now. I will use it to keep track on possible setups. I am going to let the EA do its thing on another demo account, let's see how it performs in a forward test

I use the base settings

Hi mrdfx....I am still getting my ducks in a row, so to speak, with this strategy, but it looks very exciting. Can you tell me, in this example, are you at all concerned that the JSRX didn't just leave the 70 level but rocketed to below the 30 level as well? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi All...can I ask: in my reading so far, it seems that the best use of the EA is as an ALERTER for setups of valid signals, and NOT to actually take the trades; is that correct? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Well FOMC did not go in favor of my two trades EU &amp; AU. This is the main thing to watch out for like I've said before.. HIN can really screw with you sometimes, yes it could have gone either way but not today lol.

Why long ? as per the rules you should see the green arrow first no ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Are you using the template on post 1? If you are it will load correctly automatically, if not then the answer has already been given a few pages back, so I'm guessing you have not read the whole thread... Have you read the strategy rules on post 1? If you are not using all the indicators and template from post 1, and as you say added other indicators, then you are not trading this strategy. If you are then please only use the template and indicators of the strategy.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
So last night before I went to bed I forgot to set TP's for my AC &amp; AJ shorts, and during the early morning they have both pulled back. They were in pretty good profits but silly me I just left them open. It seems like AUD is has some strength today which is helping these pull backs. I'm still holding both trades, and at the end of today I will see whether I'll hold them over the weekend. AC +10 pips. AJ -14 pips.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Sorry, I didn't know that I can not bring any other ideas.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I did not say that, if you read the first post you will see that I wrote: If you have a good idea or proposal that can improve on the strategy post it with an explanation to validate your proposal. You also mentioned that the ZigZag repaints, yes this is correct and has been explained previously, it is one of the main indicators of this strategy so if you remove it you are not trading this strategy.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
UPDATE: So Yen was weak today and AJ short hit my SL for -37 pips. I closed AC short for +57 pips, not bad in the end. Have a good weekend all!

" If you have a good idea or proposal that can improve on the strategy post it with an explanation to validate your proposal." "You also mentioned that the ZigZag repaints , yes this is correct and has been explained previously," Boa noite MRDX . First of all, thank you for your efforts. 2 issues: -I do have a filter to improve the strategy, (though I´m not sure if it can be reproduced, using only Metatrader). -The arrow I marked on this chart, was actually happening on that bottom, or did it repaint?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Have a great weekend Mrdfx

--- 帖子 #289 ---
explanation: I am an Elliot Wave fan, I use Dynamic Trade software for my analysis. Here is same EURUSD chart, I calculated the End of wave 5 ,(in Elliot terms, the end of an impulsive swing)..in this case a bear swing. The strategy in this thread tends to be counter trend, since it uses pivot and indicator extremes. It tries to pick tops and bottoms, which is both risky/and potentially highly rewarding. The software I use (I´m not trying to sell it here, I bought it myself), has tools to calculate Elliot waves, measure distances in time and price (!), to calculate these levels in advance. The levels I marked were calculated a couple of days before. Now, looking back,I marked the zig zag arrow on the bar (extracted from the metatrader template). Look how the Zig Zag arrow was just 1 bar after the highest probability time bar (below in purple) marked by the software (which does this statistically, using fibo ratios, no hocus pocus). Actually the bar before, was the lowest close. At the same time EURUSD had reached the ideal price zone for an end of wave 5. Hope I did not confuse anybody here, and I´m not trying to deviate from the thread. Myself, I will continue with my Elliot Waves, and use the excellent template MRDX provided as my final trigger. You all have a great weekend... (btw, that was not a solitary coincidence, I have seen it happen on mutiple charts).

Can you share the Cffp indicator? thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I see you trade the 1 H frame, I like it too, but don´t trade it, beacuse you cannot follow through at night. The 240 chart, is more relaxed, and you only miss one bar in the middle of the night. Otherwise 15 ,5 , and daylys do the job well too...and you can stay in control. CosmasMoses seems to be trading the system profitably with 4 H charts. Just my 2 cents worth.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Cosmasmoses, Question, how come you got stopped on the EURUSD long on the 24th.? looking back, it looks like a winner. Btw. very professional aproach to trading, keeping a precise record of your business!!! Keep it up. Also I realized your winners are mostly bigger than your loosers, also a mark of a good trader.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I like this one because the top, a few bars before, was "stop ran" by the bar with the arrow. Also there´s a divergence on the indie below.

Thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts, and trades results. I also can only trade on H4 charts. What are the rules for Cffp indicator?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
If you have read the previous thread you will see that originally we were trading on H4 only, but since that time things developed and I noticed that I can get earlier entries on H1 which equals more pips. Trading on H1 has its risks though, mostly being too early and entering on a false reversal, so there's that, but I have had good success on H1 hence updating the strategy accordingly, but that is not to say that H4 is not successful, indeed H4 still works well and is a 'safer' more chilled approach.

valseva I can see you are trying/adding new things to modify the strategy as your charts hardly resemble the SDTR template, however like I said on post 1, if you have a good idea or proposal that can improve on the strategy post it with an explanation to validate your idea/proposal. In the mean time please only post charts using the template and indicators of the strategy,

--- 帖子 #363 ---
This question has already been answered, read back you will find it.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi jdva yes that is not a valid set up according to the rules as we don't trade off the pivot point. Sometimes you can catch a pair as it starts trending away from the pivot point, but this is risky and not recommended. I do see in this case you got lucky and it was profitable.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Valid signal on CADCHF, but i am not taking it yet. I quess i'll wait for a confirmation on H4. Looking back on the daily, there is a chance that this trend is going to reverse

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi all. I understand many don't trade CHF pairs, i just noticed a sell set up on usd chf. Kindly advice for my learning curve if this is a valid set up according to SDTR strategy, thanks.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Welcome bobshah yes that is a valid signal. Not trading CHF &amp; NZD pairs is my personal preference, and its not to say that this strategy won't work on them. If you don't mind trading them then go ahead.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Rules to buy: A green ZigZag Arrow will appear. The Turbo JSRX indicator was/is in the oversold zone (Below the 30% level) and indicating a green uptrend. The price will hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100. When the candle crosses, and closes above the 10 EMA up from below, and only if the trade is still confirmed by the 3 indicators. Hi mrdfx and all, Just wanted to clarify the chart of GU attached , say if the current candle close above the MA, the turbo indicator is on around between 70 to 80 zone then, and green in color. Is it still regarded as a valid signal? Sorry if this newbie question has been raised before .

--- 帖子 #369 ---
do agree not 100% according your rules, but I would take such a "signal" over and over again, if I get several strongly conforming signals from my technical analysis like the EA trade yesterday from WS38 and daily S3 (meanwhile 200 pips ahead). I won't post the trade in order not to confusing others and disturbing your good thread. But...I think that is the big advantage of manual discretionary trading against robot trading. Otherwise an EA would give similar profitable results as well.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Looking at the chart there is no valid set up yet, but once the candle closes above the MA it will be. The main validation we look for when using the Turbo JSRX indicator is its position when there is a ZigZag arrow. At the time of the ZigZag arrow where was the Turbo JSRX indicator? It needs to be either in oversold -30 or overbought zones +70.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
We will never be able to fully emulate human intuition and human intervention into an EA, and this will always be the negative part of creating an EA from a strategy. As much as we can program an EA to follow the technical aspects of a strategy to the dot, the lack of human intuition will never make it as good as manual trading, but that is not to say its not possible to create a successful EA.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I MRDF, i like your strategy and i will try to understand and test it in the next few weeks. Cheers

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi MRDFX, yes there was no valid set up when i uploaded the chart. I wanted to understand the Turbo JSRX and the Zigzag arrow, which you explained very well and i understood , thank you for your help.

The thing is that EA opens trades often close to R38, PP and S38. For some reason it doesn't ignore those, I practice with for the whole month. H1 is kind of risky and opens lot trades that close with loses. H4 and daily timeframes are more reliable and gives you time to think. You can use it as alerting tool for now. Need to modify the code to let it trade accordingly strategy rules

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi guys, I've noticed on your charts that some of you have pivot and S/R lines running straight thru days, like mine a some of you have them shifted after midnight,like I guess it supposed to be.

Hi MRDFX, i too entered on the signal, but later closed it with +25 pips, coz i felt it will go north as i saw bullish divergence at that time. Actually im curious to ask you whether you close that position manualy or let it to hit SL?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Do you look at higher timeframes for confirmation? I looked at the demo trades for the ea and there it seemed the losses could have been avoided by looking at the direction for daily, weekly, monthly.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Entered short on EN &amp; EA

--- 帖子 #353 ---
No, I disagree...stay tuned and take the next upcomig signals on that pair and increase the lotsize moderately in steps... Happy trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #354 ---
yes, the EA definetly blew himself up in the last two days. From a 10% gain over the week to a drop of 20% in 2 days. Most of the drop could have been avoided by a trend filter.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
OK, it seems for eurcad which went into a loss then the EA should have waited with the entry. The EA is a bit quick on the trigger for H1.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi bkv007 I closed the order manually.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I don't do that, but you could although it might be difficult to confirm any set ups on lower TF. By looking on higher TF like D1, W1 etc you could find that a pair might be in a bullish trend but on H1 there is a bearish reversal confirmation and if you had to cross check D1/W1 you would miss the trade. This is a trend reversal strategy where we are looking to catch the end of a trend and beginning of a new one, and looking to higher TF will not work in this case.

mrdfx , according to post 1, pivot level are important to this strategy and when I've noticed,that people post charts with different pivot lines and I asked you to post pivot indicator setting,your reaction is dislike my post. Way to go, OP. Thanks for help.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I will tell you why. You keep asking about an indicator which is not used in this strategy and I did direct you to the relevant thread to get assistance. Use the pivot indicator and template found on post 1, if you can't do that simple thing then perhaps this strategy is not for you.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Looks like I missed a good signal on AU earlier, did anyone get in on it?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
depending on your broken you will have different levels it might not be exactly like someone else chart but its the area you are looking at to enter the trade.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Thanks for quick response. As i mentioned in post 394, I've downloaded indicator from post 1 in this thread. Look at your chart from post 401 and look at mine and check pivots. My pivots for some reason are running in straight line (so some other people posting here) and your are changing every day.I think I have to change something in indicator setting and I'm trying figure,what. I did change time zone and didn't help. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Ok I will repeat myself as you just not getting it. You are using Davits pivot which is not used in my strategy. If you really did download from post one you will see that I am using Pivot Voty which is a different pivot indicator, so I really think you got confused and mixed up somewhere.

Stay tuned, my friend: The SDTR EA originally developed by ebeckers has been discontinued temporarily. Due to the poor results of the EA, and also that the strategy has been recently updated, it has been removed. We are currently working on a new EA with the updated strategy rules. It will be released for testing soon. Stay tuned!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks bro

..so one can fool oneself !

Yes the MBFX on the EA is the same as the JSRX. In the first thread we were using a decompiled MBFX indicator so I changed it to the JSRX indicator which is basically the same thing.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
The first 2 look good once the final confirmation is given. Looking at them now and how CAD is moving the first 2 would be in good profits now. The last one does not look valid.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I suggest you go the the first thread where the EA was developed, there you can find info on it. This thread is not about the EA, its about the strategy, the EA is a supplemental tool.

[Цитата = valseva; 12002856] {} Изображение [/ цитата] Hello How do you close the basket?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I cut the SL too close and got taken out on two of them. the other one just clobbered me. Can you tell me why the the 3rd setup (GBPCAD) didn't look valid? The ZZ was outside the S38 and the jsrx had enetred the OS zone. When price closed above the 10EMA....is good? Your input is very much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #433 ---
At the time of the ZZ, price was outside of the 38 levels and below the 100 levels

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Rules to buy: A green ZigZag Arrow will appear. The Turbo JSRX indicator was/is in the oversold zone (Below the 30% level) and indicating a green uptrend. The price will hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100. When the candle crosses, and closes above the 10 EMA up from below, and only if the trade is still confirmed by the 3 indicators.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi Again, Yup, I read that and thought I was operating within those guidelines. All ZZ arrows were outside the 38 levels and within the 100 levels. Does within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) mean that price (at the ZZ arrow) must be at least 25 pips into the levels? Cheers

Mrdfx...please can you explain why you don't like trading from the S/R38 levels, even if there has been strong trending pairs in the prior week and therefore pivot levels beeing wider apart from each other? Any experiences? Thanks and happy weekend!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
hi mrdfx.thanks for your work.i was in your pervious thread.does this strategy on 1hour work as good as 4hour?what is your Preference ?thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
If you study more about weekly pivots and how we use them as S&amp;R levels we are looking for extremes to increase the likely hood of a reversal happening. The chance of a reversal on S/R38 is less likely than 61, 78, and 100. The more the price moves away from the pivot the higher chance of reversal, but of course if there is a strong trend established then price can move past 100 level which then we will not trade that pair.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi 12mohana please read first post how we are trading this strategy. You can also read the last few pages of the previous thread to see the reasons of the updates to the strategy.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Its a slow Monday and most times we will not have many signals on a Monday as we wait for price to move into valid pivot zones, but there has been a valid sell signal on AC. I did not take the trade, but I'll monitor it.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
yep good signal but off R38... !

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Excuse me, do we look for " hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61" at the moment of the arrow appearance or till all the indicators confirm? At this situation with AC we have arrow in 11 pips from S61, but the final confirmation (MA cross) was at 36 pips from S61. Is it still valid?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
hy bro, can you upload this ea preset?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Yes correct it is 11 pips from R61 so it is within the zone. We are looking for the zigzag arrow to be in the pivot zone when it appears, not for the price to be in the zone at the final confirmation of the MA. To be in the pivot zone is one of the main criteria before the final confirmation.

Hi mrdfx, Sorry for disrupting. I didn't want nor do want to be disrespectfull but, may I know why you disliked my post? Does it has to do with the fact that I'm not using the suggested template? if that's the problem OK, I recognize I'm not using the exact template, and I apologize for that, but in the other hand, I think I am using the suggested tools, and placed the trades according to the rules: Rules to buy: A green ZigZag Arrow will appear. The Turbo JSRX indicator was/is in the oversold zone (Below the 30% level) and indicating a green uptrend. The price will hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100. When the candle crosses, and closes above the 10 EMA up from below, and only if the trade is still confirmed by the 3 indicators. Do we agree on that? thanks in advance for your response. masilva

Good Day Everyone, I would like to post this message as a token of appreciation for all the effort and interaction that has gone into this EA becoming what it is today. I started following the threads from the initial ebeckers pin bar EA/thread, I also read the entire thread of Simple Daily Trend Reversal Trading System (200 pages, 4475 posts). I've had to read a lot first and I'm sure I've missed some things along the way. I'm still on version 1.25 before pivots made their introduction and impact - even speaking on that basis I think the work has been magnificent (I tested it on H1 and it made over 420 pips, NZD &amp; GBP volatility last Friday). So a very special thank you to mrdfx, ebeckers, fxmadness and other constant contributors that are active and adding value to making this a success. Keep up the great work and efforts in this collaborative journey in what is a very difficult environment for retail traders, technology certainly alleviating some pains in this regard. Thanks a mill everyone on the chat. Regards, Mo'

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi, mrdfx, I have read this over and over and thought I had it; clearly not. So correct me if I'm wrong (again): the pivot levels (S61, 78, 100 and R61, 78, 100) EACH have THEIR OWN pivot zones. So: S61 pivot zone would be S61 +/- 12ish pips (for a 25 pip zone spanning across S61) S78 pivot zone would be S78 +/- 12ish pips (for a 25 pip zone spanning across S78) Etc, etc, for each pivot level. And price at the ZZ (high/low point) must be withing these 25 pip zones. If price traveled, for example, 18 pips past S61 and had not reached the zone for S78, it would be no trade. Please tell me this is right.............

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Yes each level has its own zone, and we look for price to hit these zones. Now every week the pivot levels change and depending on the previous weeks PA, these levels can be far away or close to each other so a little human discretion is needed at times.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Good buy signal this morning on USDCAD which I missed. Did anyone catch it?

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yes, I caught it.... Unfortunately, my dashboard doesn't show properly (margins and all) not sure how to fix it. But it's second from the bottom, 32 pips.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Up to S61 21 pips, although earlier they wrote that +/- 12 pips I therefore did not go.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Welcome forexbandit7 please make sure to read post 1 carefully and download the indicators and template. Personally I use ExtDepth of 40 for the Zig Zag. Lower will give you more arrows, and higher less arrows and I have found from my experience that using 40 is a good balance of not too many and not too few. I was using 60 before in the beginning but found that I missed out on some good set ups so I went down to 40.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thank you very much mrdfx, will read up post and thanks for input abt the zigzag. green pips to you.....

Hello guys, Just starting using this system so far and i love it. But i good some problems with the EA: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It shows that these 2 are valid signals, but in fact they are not - i used the setting from post 1. Would be nice if someone could tell me what i'm doing wrong! thanks edit: now it also printed a signal on EURJPY, we are not even close to R38 and it prints valid signal for R61? How can this happen?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
thank you for the system. I really like the basket trade on this one

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Those two signals are valid? See screenshots. Though you could argue whether the S38 trade for AUDCAD should have been taken.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Thank you! I didn't pay attention to those pivots because they are from last week - that was confusing me the same happened with EUR/JPY, right? But the AUDCAD should not give a signal since S38 is not valid according to rules from OP?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Correct but actually S38/R38 trades can be fine for certain low ADR pairs but I know that it is not according to the rules.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
If I am not mistaken those pivots are correct since we are using last week's data, not this week's data

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Yes but the lines which are shown for today are calculated by data from last week - so the signals are based on last weeks pivots (which are calculated from the week before last week) - at least that's what i think thanks anyways!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Both of your trades are not valid as they formed in R38 line. On the other hand if the price open with a gap is an issue to be addressed. To the common sense stay away if there is a gap. Regards,

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I know it is not valid trade but someone said that it is right in case of lower ADR pair (S/R38 line) What is the price open with a gap? Teach me please

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi Chris, Both of them are not valid due to various reasons but most importantly due to be formed in R38. I am not saying R38 is not tradable but it is the authors advice and shall be kept that way. However for one to be successful it should have a proper risk management along with mastering a certain strategy. As far as I can see we are all focused on entries but exists are rarely a subject to talk. For those newbies who are interested to have a simple yet effective risk management would be modifying your fibonacci tool as a risk manager. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Level Discription 0 0.0 1 Entry 2.382 TP1 3.382 TP2 4.382 TP3 The idea is to have a positive return in every each trade you are getting. You should have minimum risk return ratio of 1:2 . This strategy has lot of good points and relatively easy to follow. So all you need is a good risk management. Also my humble advice would be not to risk more than 2% a trade and try not take same pair trades at the same time. Eg. Do not trade AUDUSD LONG and CADUSD LONG (unless you really really know what you are doing ). Regards,

--- 帖子 #539 ---
ADR is not set as a parametre by the author. As I understand you are bored waiting for the right set up to come so you would like to find a way to get in trading. If you read the author carefuly you will see this is a counter trend strategy. So you have to wait for right counter movement (which is not too many times but once it comes it gives you a good RR profit). So in order to make this system more productive you need to have a trend following system that could be integrated to this system (which I have.. but I am keeping quiet due the nature of this tread). Therefore if you can find and apply a trend following system you would have more signals. If you have any problems with the current version of SDTR feel free to ask .

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I've got another question: When the EA is activated (to monitor the indicators and profit/loss): how does it know that trades are taken based on the system? (because i do use another system for daily and above) Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #460 ---
so based on the rule that the buy signal is valid, but the price is going the wrong direction, would you buy now? the entry price will be lower than the original entry price, and it hasn't drop below S/L

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Regarding to this chart I would say YES it is valid. But better be confirmed by the author. At least better RR ratio.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I am among the lucky ones to get this strategy. I have only used it for a few days manually, the results are amazing. Yesterday, I started trading in the London and New York sessions, with lots of 0.10, real account balance of 470 usd for EURUSD and GBPUSD pairs, and USDJPY able to profit 10 USD. I use it in the M15 time frame. There are a number of things from trading rules for Buy and Sell that I do not obey. I only refer to the zigzag arrow and JRSX Turbo indicators. Indeed, there are some of my entries that have experienced floating, but it's only a few moments. For example: When the zigzag arrow shows the direction of Buy, and the JRSX Turbo is in the oversold area (it hasn't changed color, it's still red), I immediately open a Buy position. Sometimes, the price still goes down even though the zig zag arrow has shown an upward direction, but it's only for a short time. Thank you very much for mrdfx for this extraordinary work. Indeed, this strategy is titled SIMPLE, but the results are truly extraordinary. Good luck always for you

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I've been following up this thread tested EA for signals only. But will test your EA finger cross!!!!

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Wow, cool Fareed51. I have also applied it to the chart, but I have not dared to do it on a real account. looking at the results of the previous backtest, I was quite interested. but I am still traumatized by EA, because a few months ago my account balance was used up to 800 usd due to ea. at that time I used EA grid, martingale, also semi grid, semi martingale, and semi hedging. In the beginning, the profit was very high. In one day it reaches 50 usd. But, when market trending, the resulting floating minus swells very large. Even though before I had tested the EA - EA on a demo account, and it worked very well. I try with the least account balance, which is 100 usd. In two weeks the profit is up to 50 usd, with floating minus only 2 usd. But after I tried it on a real account, the result was inversely proportional. because of that, I'm a little afraid to use EA.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
You should be but you are in right thread. Download mrdfx template, study from his moves and take trades with him. Discuss your winning and loosing trades in here. that's how you will learn with mrdfx and his mates. You need to learn manual trading and just can't rely on EA only. Good luck.

I had a problem with the ea where it enter a trade multiple times. It lost like 27 dollars like that.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi Meerrettich first of all make sure you have all the 28 forex pairs showing in your market watch window so that the EA can see them. It is also normal that not all 28 pairs will show on the dashboard at the same time as it depends on which pairs are matching with the indicators. It looks like you have not enabled the 2 inputs below which is the time and pips filter which are set to false by default.

I feel like all the trades The ea has taken hasn’t been that good. I have on the daily 1 hour and the 4 hour

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I just joined, this method I like because it has rules and effectiveness. However, I have read 31 pages in this topic but I don't see chrisdk2017's tutorial version 1.26. Please share. I want to learn more about this automated trading method. Because I am using demo account. Sincere thanks!

Thank you very much! Now that I've got everything set up properly, I'm going to test it for a few weeks (on demo) and report my results here.

Hi mrdfx, Thank you for the great sharing of this strategy. I went through most of the posts in this forum, unfortunately I unable to find the EA set file for each M30, H1, H4 and Daily timeframes. If you dont mind, kindly please share your set file for each timeframe for this latest EA 1.26. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
I checked, installed on MT4 but did not run. We hope you share more useful information. Thanks 1

all green pips

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi morito on the first post you can find the set file I am using for H1. There are not set files for other time frames as I do not trade on them. You can try on other time frames and see if you have a good result on them.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I have updated first post with chrisdk2017's version as so far this week its been accurate to the strategy, thank you chrisdk2017. I have also uploaded the set file of the exact settings I am using, but feel free to experiment and maybe you will find an even better setting.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi mrdfx Are you using the v1.26 default settings or are you applying one of your set files on post 1? Thanks Carlos

--- 帖子 #621 ---
The first week of running the EA has been pretty good, only 8 signals this week but overall still made a profit of +133 pips. @chrisdk2017 I think there is something wrong with the calculations of the trades on the panel as it says 8 trades but below it says 4 / 3. The profit factor also looks very high and probably incorrect, can you take a look? Thanks.

Thanks to @mrdfx, @chrisdk2017 and evryone here. Found the thread some days ago and enjoyed the work done so far. I have read all 32 pages of this thread and the last 15 pages of the original thread I loaded the EA v1.26 today and it opened 5 trades. I'm a bit confused when @mrdfx said the EA opened 8 trades all week Pls, if you can, post the settings so that I can follow well Thank you again P.S attached is my current settings

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Thanks for your update. What are your setting looks like? Does your stopLossAtZigZagArrow=true or false? Thanks

Why was the Beast Super Signal removed from this thread if it is based on this strategy?

I have seen and downloaded Simple Daily Trend Reversal v1.26 to install in the Indicators folder. and restart MT4 and try to use, but the system has not changed. I have attached the installation image. Can you share that I have set up properly? If it is not correct, please look forward to how to set up? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
HI, Why for me not working? I put in export indicator, but nothink show for me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I took a look at it and although there are some similarities it does use not the same strategy and it repaints heavily making it useless to use.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
The Simple Daily Trend Reversal v1.26 is an EA and needs to be installed into the Expert Advisors folder.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Looks odd, it can only happen if profit for one of the trades is exactly zero then it won't count neither as "Won" nor "Lost". The profit factor is calculated as follows: Inserted Code ProfitFactor = MathAbs( totalAmountWon / totalAmountLost); so if total amount lost (nominated in your currency) is a small number, the profit factor will be very big. For info I haven't touched any of the other code in this EA other than adding the pivot, 3c turbo code and the ADR trailing stop code.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
ok thanks

--- 帖子 #632 ---
YES I KNOW. But nothing showing for me. And tell me where put ""SDTR PIVOTS H1.set"" Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #633 ---
SDTR PIVOTS H1.set is a preset file that you can basically store anywhere on your PC since you can load it from anywhere. (you can put it in MQL4/presets folder) When editing the EA's inputs click on load and select the preset file in your filebrowser.

I have checked the functionality, as I have not yet discovered how to remove the chart from the desktop? Please guide me and how to make a transaction correction if any. Thanks

You will remove the graph so that you put NONE instead of colors in the properties!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I think, you want to remove GREEN and RED bars. Just press F8 and select NONE to all GREEN and RED or whatever colors. Manually: right click on your chart, select properties, you will see same window as F8.

Hello traders. Pls does anyone know whether the EA automated trading has any means of securing stop loss just in case vps shuts down while there are open trades without visible stop loss?

Currently automatic transactions on continue losses. You can give more detailed instructions or share the parameter file on the above method so I can know more. Thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
The default settings for e and SDTR are correct, but I only use the Pivot column for information, and I trade the price manually on weekly pivot. The Pivot Trading Strategy can be found here at FF. For me and SDTR not working well, I'm a more aggressive trader

--- 帖子 #627 ---

I'm currently demo testing the daily pivot and weekly pivot. Attached are the daily pivot results for just two days. I'm very impressed with the 154 pips gained. After a sufficient time period, I'll use the Trade Report to thin out the herd for the best performers.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Try changing the history setting in the pivot indicator so it will not load previous weeks pivots, that should make it better visually.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
The is not a miracle EA that will help you recover losses, this is a strategy for short term intra day trading and an EA was developed. As I said on post 1 I advised to only use this on demo. The set file I am using is also on post 1, but you can also experiment on finding another setting that works for you.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
This is NOT Davit's pivot strategy. If you want to talk about his strategy then do so in his thread.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Thanks for that info, good findings! Did the dashboard portray your actual win/lost statistics because I learnt it's NOT calculating perfectly

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I ran the numbers and they seem to be in line. However, my weekly pivot results have me baffled. I had three trades, two of which closed at 00.00, and one winner which closed at 00.01. Doesn't make sense - looks like it wants to close all my trades at BE. So far, this hasn't happened with the daily pivot demo. I'm using the H1 set file posted on the forum.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Update on the EA since starting last week. So far so good. EA and my set file is on first post.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Which one is expected to more convincing, weekly or daily pivot? Mine is suffering..

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Yes, you're right, I'm sorry

--- 帖子 #671 ---
This strategy uses weekly pivots not daily.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Thank you for the answer. Today I started on hourly chart with Daily pivot, seems running fine. Closed in 70 pip profit, similar profit floating. Weekly pivot may be more accurate on 4H charts? What do you think?

Attached, is a two-day report for my weekly pivot demo. 195 net pips is very strong performance. Let's see if it can keep up the momentum.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Good! So your trades with the weekly pivot paid off after all, guess you just needed some patience! Your first 2-3 trades that got stopped out at BE had nothing to do with daily/weekly pivot, but the trailing stop settings. No settings has all the edge. I believe, overall, the automated trading will be a success!!

--- 帖子 #676 ---
It's only been a few days, but the results are encouraging. Aside from a good profit factor, the most important thing to me is how well the EA handles drawdown.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Yes, I understand! I'm not looking at the profit made or performance really. I have been trading a system manually for a while that is well known, very profitable and consistent over several decades. Just as I plugged in the EA on demo and continued my manual trading on live account, I realized it was taking about 80% of the same trades I took on my live account with this strategy. Also, I've been trading for a while, and from my observation, with good money mgt the EA has all it takes to succeed. There will be drawdowns but the high win rate will give it an edge!

--- 帖子 #678 ---
What setting are you using?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
The H1 setfile posted on thread

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Bravo. Thanks a lot @Wladimir. Can you please tell what's your TakeProfit settings? Those I currently have close all trades at the BE. Thanks

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Performance so far since Mar 13 2019 H1 + H4. 1.26 defaults.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Thank you chriskd2017, After three weeks you are in 0.18 USD profit....at least not in minus. Any idea how to improve?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
There are some pairs you should'nt have traded with this system; GBPAUD, GBPNZD, CADCHF and USDCHF. The first two pairs; GBPAUD, GBPNZD, the standard 100 pips stop loss will be too small for them. I also believe the 1hr timeframe may be better! Just my opinion, pls.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Just less then week though! SO, it needs more time to prove anything. Using the set file on page one. I only changed my risk% using MM

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Excellent performance. Nothing wrong with those numbers.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
parameter \ - Trailing stoploss settingss - \ green pips

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Your settings show you using a fixed TS, whereas on my set file I use ADR TS. As each pair moves differently it does not make sense to use the same TS for every pair, and by using ADR TS you can have TS that suits each pair individually.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Thank you both. Now, I'm clear on the TS settings

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Dear All, I got again 3 orders closed at 0. However, from 150 pips DD I went back to 50 pips profit. Now, again in 50 pips DD. This system has Huge potential. But it needs very high win rate to balance big losses. And requires fine tuning the tp and sl settings. Another point, what about the close of positions on friday? I do not think simple let them run is meaningful, and closing all is a risk in case there is a DD happening. Better not to trade on friday, close everything when in profit on thurday?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I am testing setting the stoploss to ADR * factor where factor is 1.5. It should be better than the fixed 100 stoploss especially for JPY and GBP pairs. (EDIT: see screenshot) For news releases I don't see any other option than to manually close since it is difficult to program when to close a position. So closing a position in profit when we see it and when a news release is coming up.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Ok, but imagine the following. The Ea is running on your laptop at home, and you are at work or anywhere else. You check on mobile your positions, and being happy with them, close all manually. Will the Ea running at home open new ones? Probably yes, who knows if the Ea crashproof or not. I have again above 100 pips DD that could ruin 3 days trading. If they cancel each other I will have 7 usd profit in 3 days, considering 0.01 lots*10 positions. Can be said good, yes, but DD is huge and risky on longer runs. See chrisdisk2017 overall 0usd result through 3 weeks period. Definitely needs improving tp and sl settings.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
No it won't, if you do not allow reentries. See the input for info. Yes. Removing bad pairs (CHF and maybe GBP) and changing SL and TP then maybe we will have a improved performance.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Thank you for the advice for reentries. That could help. On bad pairs, now Gbp is easy to avoid of, but what about the future? We need to monitor and filter somehow the most risky pairs, from week to week? Now, being Brexit or not, Eur is as much risky then Gdb. We wil remain nothing In short, DDs cannibalize profit

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Having DD is completely normal especially when you are basket trading, if you think 100 pips DD on a basket is not very good then you need to lower your risk so you won't worry so much cos 100 pips DD on a basket is not so big. To maximize the profit you can set the TP, SL and TS however you want, personally I use ADR as I think its most effective, but some like using R:R for TP &amp; SL.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Let me get into more detail about my TS settings I use. So I'm using ADR % as my TP &amp; SL so that means I use average daily range percentage. I use a 20 day period as that gives the average daily average for the previous month which I prefer, while some might prefer using a 5 day period but that is more volatile for me. I set my SL at 100% ADR and then set my 1st TP as BE once the 25% ADR is hit, so basically once the pair reaches 25% of the ADR it moves to BE, then when it moves to 50% the SL is moved to 25%, and I use a 10% trail step. Personally I think this works better as we are trading multiple pairs in a basket and a fixed TP &amp; SL doesn't fit for every pair. The only thing with using ADR is sometimes the profits are not as big as we would like if for example we took a trade on AU, the 20 period ADR is only 50 pips so if we hit TS4 which is 100% that's only 50 pips with a 50 pip SL, whereas on a pair like GU its 148 pips, so quite a big difference. This is my preference, but you can use your own if you like. Feel free to experiment and share your results.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
You're saying the 100-pip SL is global? During one of my demos, I had 165 pips in DD and none of the orders were closed.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I'm currently having 140 pips DD and nothing is closed. Something is definitely wrong.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
The settings are not global, if you are using 100 pips SL that applies to each pair individually, all MM settings apply to individual pairs.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
I think you need to lower your risk or perhaps stay away from basket trading if 140 pip DD makes you nervous. Remember with basket trading you are trading multiple pairs concurrently and DD can get high at times before pairs go into profit, especially trading a reversal strategy.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Thanks for the clarification.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
That is wise what you are saysing, I was just reflecting the fact that R:R is low if DD is such high. And definitely a timebomb. My problem was with 140 pips DD that sl was not activated however set to 100... Anyway, I will continue testing with daily and weekly pivot, removing GBP pairs.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Based on the OP's explanation, the situation we have experienced means that none of the individual pairs exceeded the 100-pip SL, even though the combined DD from all the pairs did exceed that number.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
This is the current situation on my demo account. 5 active orders with a current -145 pips DD which equates to around -4% DD, not too bad actually. With basket trading you need to have patience, trust in the strategy and let the trades play out. Alternatively don't let the EA auto trade, set it to false and trade the signals manually and you can pick and choose which ones you want to take or leave.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Is that for this EA or the pivot EA cos I saw you posted the same result there.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I manually closed all. Remained 130 pips DD, overall 30 pips profit in three days. Hope better next week. I had daily Pivot on 1H chart. Just thinking? Does anyone tried to open every morning a basket, then close in profit or day end?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
You will have very different results using daily pivots instead of weekly, but feel free to try. Personally daily pivots did not work better then weekly.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I just put every file in their places on my live account just to see if it works. (Trades are allowed.) But it does not. Any idea?

@chrisdk2017, @mrdfx -- just discovered this thread -- most interesting. I'm enjoying experimenting with it and looking forward to Monday when the market re-opens. Regarding the snippet of code above that calculates ProfitFactor -- there's a bug. What happens when 'totalAmountLost' is 0? The result is undefined and it blows up. Before dividing by 'totalAmountLost' the code should first check for '0' or a small number. For example, define a small number like -- double dEpsilon = 0.01; -- and if totalAmountLost is &lt; dEpsilon then set ProfitFactor to '1', or something like that. Thanks for an excellent thread...

--- 帖子 #713 ---
That zero is already checked for. Not sure who uses that info panel since you can just look at myfxbook. In my early days I was into all sorts of stats, like sharpe ratio etc etc. I don't think these numbers matter at all, it is more a quant thing to judge automated trading systems.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
@chrisdk2017 -- nice response, thanks. I understand your point. I think stats become more important when traders use multiple strategies or EAs -- you need some kind of metric to compare how strategies perform relative to one another. Exactly what that metric is -- well, that could be a topic for its own thread. 'ProfitFactor' is simple to understand, so it's a good starting point.

Hi fareed51, I'm aware of these settings, for sure experst are enabled, automatic trading enabled, allow trading in expert true. Just compare in my pics here: demo accounts running, live is not. I start assuming live trading is disabled as this project will be a commercial product shortly. Already have seen on FF the same, for example: CS28 strenght indicator, weekly ccfp trading.

Thanks for posting the screen shot, foff00. They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
@ChicagoRob -- why leave so quick? @mrdfx and @chrisdk2017 have repeatedly said the EA should only be run in a Demo account. Besides, in the event the EA cripples live trading, it is possible to have a Demo account communicate with a Live account to Enter and Exit trades.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Hi . real account. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...1#post12199001 You need an understanding of EA . You will succeed ! https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post12189103 I have a rule : "I manage EA . EA does not control me."

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I stand corrected. I just loaded the EA on my live account and I have the smiley face. foff00's problem must be with his broker.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Mea culpa. It was my problem, I'm sorry about that guys, please do not take personal. I tell you what I did. We might learn something from that. I have 3 Mt4s. One was installed to Windows. The other two just copied into folders. Demos are running on copied instances while live account on the installed one. If I put the ea and system onto MT4 in copied folder, it works fine. Somehow is blocked by Win10on the installed folder.

Hi, Can you please post the mq4 file for SDTR v1.26.ex4

There is no limitations on this EA and this will never be commercial. Don't make assumptions.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi, What is the role of Candle Timer.ex4 &amp; pipsometer decimal edit 2.ex4 for deciding the buy and sell condition? I have listed down the indicators that are required as per the rules. Rules to buy: A green ZigZag Arrow will appear. - ZigZag Arrow indicator to be used The Turbo JSRX indicator was/is in the oversold zone (Below the 30% level) and indicating a green uptrend. - Turbo JSRX indicator to be used The price will hit and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100. - Pivot_Voty indicator to be used When the candle crosses, and closes above the 10 EMA up from below, and only if the trade is still confirmed by the 3 indicators. - MA indicator to be used

--- 帖子 #653 ---
why will you need mq file as long you can play free with ex file without any limitations? you have some plans with mq file?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
They are just visual aids to assist your trading, they have no role in trade entry.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I have two good ideas. Firstly, we can use standard deviation indicator to find exits when that becomes flat, can we? Secondly, there are indicators for support and resistance leveles, would be interesting to use it instead of Pivot. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #656 ---
You better have a chat with your admiral broker. Why am I saying that? Because I've been trading weekly ccfp trading live too :') and its not going to be commercial at all loll... I've known mrdfx from many other forums with dingdong &amp; gvc. He's not greedy and won't make it commercial. commercial prodcuts never make any sense, if product EA is profitable so why don't they earn PIPS than selling that product to NEEDY people. Anways do contact admiral and have a chat to them about your live account issue, or contact mrdfx to guide you to the RIGHT versions. Or you may need to loadhistory.script just have a chat with mrdfx.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi, As I had reported live issue has been solved. On ccfp, I read on that forum is going to be commercial. But it is a different story.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi, Agree that I can play free with ex file. However, I want to do some changes in trailing SL as per my requirement. If you have the file, please share....

--- 帖子 #659 ---
We shouldn't discuss that weekly EA in here, however you have brought up so just to clarify you. Xmess7 was asked by one of the member and jess just replied that may be but fyi Jess has done multiple other projects and I am sure jess won't make it commercial. Anyways we are done discussing both topics for now So let's test this EA from this forum and bring forward results for all members. But its good your live issues are resolved .

@mrdfx -- I've been running the EA for a little over a day and it seems to working (28 pairs, M30 time frame), though not too many trades. I understand the meaning of most of the columns -- except for 'Age'. Sorry if this has already been covered, but I've been searching and can't find an explanation. My 'Age' column is only gray cells, whereas the other columns are a mix of red, green, or gray. What is the purpose of the 'Age' column -- is it a filter and can it be disabled? Thanks...

Hi everybody, I started my test today, 1H timeframe with the .set file in the 1st post. I had 2 signals that became 2 take profit (I let the EA open the trade but then I prefer to set my personal SL, at the moment my R:R is 1:1). In these first days I want to study the % of correct signals and then I will work on the MM. @ mrdfx , GREAT THREAD!!!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi @mrdfx and @chrisdk2017, I am using the EA from the post #573 but it's not taking trades automatically. The signals appear in the window with the EA, AutoTrading is On in the Setting, on the MT4 and so is the smiley present, but it's just not AutoTrading. I currently have a NZDCAD signal, but its not auto trading so I am currently placing the trades manually. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #665 ---
@MianAamer -- near the top of the Input settings you'll see one called "allow Trading". Make sure that is set to 'true'.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Interesting to see which one will gain or lose more: 1. on daily, 25 pips in profit, 8 orders floating at 0. 2. On weekly, nothing closed, 3 orders floating at 0. Which one would be more profitable?To open more but small positions or open a few but higher lot? Most importantly, is there anyone to seek a suitable selection criteria for pairs to run on? I probably expect better results on ranging markets.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Thanks @robots4me, it is set to 'true'

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Please PM me with the details, thank you.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Entry after hourly green candle close above red open. SL below set up green candle.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
v1.26 was released by chrisdk2017 with the pivots. Perhaps send him a PM.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
robots4me You will only get a signals once all the criteria of the strategy match, so some days there might be no signals, and other days many, it all depends on the market. As for age that is a filter for the age of the signal. In the inputs you can select how long after a new signal appears it remains valid. If you set 1 then after 1 hr the signal will be invalid. Pips works the same way but counting in pips instead of hrs.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
@mrdfx -- got it -- thank you...

--- 帖子 #747 ---
@mrdfx Latest version of EA downloaded and installed . 1. EA ver 1.26 shows MA 15. Rules state to use EMA 10 2. EU &amp; EG trade setups are valid, but EA does not show validity in column 3. EA did not send out alert, although alert setting is on true Please look into these points. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #748 ---
The answer is in the upper right-hand corner.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I've never used the EA for auto trading, but use it for the alerts and then do manual trading. All the time, the EA responded correctly by showing and giving alerts. Previous version did work correctly. Please advise which MA is correct? MA 15 as per EA or EMA 10 as per the rules.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hi Chrisdk2017, I don't have option to send PM. Can you suggest any alternate way to contact you.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
MA 15 is a display issue, the calculation is using ma 10. If it does not say Buy or Sell it is not valid. These issues were in the original code and has not been fixed. Reasons for not valid trades: reentry filter, spread or time. These are not displayed in the overview.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Why don't you write your trailing proposal here, I don't want to put my personal email address on a forum.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I have sent you PM now.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
@chrisdk2017 -- I was able to build the EA from the Github sources. However, it seems to be missing that nice, bluish statistics window and also the listing of current positions. Would you consider sharing the source for those features and any bug fixes you've made. I like the way the EA is performing and if I can help with any improvements then I would, of course, share those with whoever was interested. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #755 ---
See if you can build this one.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
@chrisdk2017 -- yes, it builds and works. It was missing one file, though -- AnalyseSymbol.mqh -- which I grabbed from the GitHub sources. I'm a very happy camper -- thank you...

--- 帖子 #757 ---
hi sir, i want your ea who use one year ao one pips tp sl. can u give me?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
A question about SL and TP -- sorry if this has been addressed in an earlier post. Are the SL and TP "hidden" -- i.e. implemented only while the EA is executing (and not registered with the broker)? The reason I ask is because the 'Trade' tab shows the SL and TP as '0' for open positions.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hidden, yes.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
@chrisdk2017 -- thanks for your answer. Another question -- I'd like to move the EA to another account but there are still a number of open positions. If I set ''allow Trading" to 'false' will the EA continue to manage the open orders (i.e. SL and TP) without opening any new ones? If not, is there a way to gracefully shut things down without manually closing? And another question -- as a US client I'm sort of limited to the number and types of accounts I can open. One of my accounts is with OANDA , which does not allow hedging and strictly follows FIFO rules. Do you know (or think) these constraints will affect the performance of the EA? I'm running it anyways and will learn shortly, I guess, but I was curious what you would say. Thanks very much...

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Not sure about the first question. You have to look into the code. If it doesn't have that functionality yet, you could code it since you have the code. It should be easy, just add a bool to check when adding new orders. Reg FIFO, sorry I don't know about it.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
@chrisdk2017 -- thanks for your answers -- they help a lot. I'll figure something out for graceful exiting. As for FIFO -- I'll just compare trading results between NFA and non-NFA accounts.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hey guys happy Friday! Here is the current standing after 3weeks weeks with not intervention. +450 pips in 3 weeks is not too bad for something that you don't even have to touch, I think this pretty much validates that the updates to the strategy has improved the results from the previous thread, if you were also following along there. From my observations CHF is still the killer and some of the losses were from mostly CHF pairs so if I was to run this live I would def stick to my preference of not trading any CHF &amp; NZD pairs. I'll check things out at the end 1 month and then maybe open a small live account to let the EA run uninterrupted. Apologies if I have not been very active here, I've been pretty busy and haven't had much time to manage and interact as much I'd like to, but I do encourage you guys to keep sharing and posting your results. Have a great weekend everyone!

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Cool!!! Did any of your trades hit the Initial stop loss of a 100 pips?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I don't use a 100 pip SL I use ADR % and out of the 13 losses only 1 hit the 100% ADR SL, the other "losses" were mostly BE.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Wow!!! That is impressive! Maybe i did'nt look at your set file closely. I'm using yours and all the while i was thinking it was a fixed stop loss of 100pips.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
@mrdfx -- thanks for the update. I used your EA in a live micro account this past week and it does great. I had quite a few more trades -- probably because I traded in the M30 time frame and also disabled the Pivot filter. No question the pivot filter improves accuracy, but I also noticed from visual inspection it causes the EA to pass on setups that look profitable. As always, it comes down to trade-offs -- reliability vs higher risk. Anyways, I'm still experimenting. Overall I would have to say this is the best I've seen. Your strategy is simple and I like the way you make use of the repainting ZigZag -- by using another indicator and "looking back" -- very clever. I like that I can visual confirm how a trade is going. I like that I have the source code and Erwin Beckers' coding is among the best I've seen. I like that your EA trades well and supports multiple pairs and doesn't require recalibration for each pair and time frame. @mrdfx -- I don't have enough superlatives. Thank you...

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Weekly 08.04./12.04. Good signal. gives H1 . M15 _ H4 \ not for all pairs \ continue the test .

--- 帖子 #769 ---
The ADR% is only for trailing, correct? So, if the TSL isn't triggered, you are still susceptible to the 100-pip SL, or am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #770 ---
No I don't use any fixed SL. If you select ADR % then ADR % will be used for the TP, SL and TS. I did explain how I use ADR % a few pages back. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post12197510

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Thanks for the clarification. I was confused, because I was seeing "100" on the screen, not realizing it was tied to the ADR% setting.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Somehow missed this post. Thanks for you very kind words robots4me, I'm happy that you find value in my strategy and this thread and if it helps improve your trading my goal is done.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
remind the reminder " Truth is like poetry. And most people f*cking hate poetry"

--- 帖子 #774 ---
@mrdfx, @chrisdk2017 -- a question about the use of OnTick (versus OnTimer). I have several live micro accounts running the SDTR EA, along with other EAs. It's Sunday afternoon on the US West Coast, the markets are open and other EAs are trading -- but not the SDTR EA. By default I'll open a chart using EURUSD / M30. I then realized the reason SDTR EA was not trading was because it was not receiving any ticks. I've used OnTimer in place of OnTick in other EAs to workaround some thread limitations imposed by MT4. Have you considered using OnTimer (e.g. every 10 seconds) in place of OnTick to drive code execution in the SDTR EA? Since your EA supports all the symbols, wouldn't using OnTimer make it less dependent on which chart (i.e. symbol) it was attached to? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Have you checked if tradeonsunday is enabled? Personally I am not not going to change much in the EA but you can if you want. I have added a min pip to close for a no SL test I am running but it will take a couple of weeks to show whether it is worthwhile.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
@chrisdk2017 -- Hmmm, my current setting is TradeOnSunday = false. I guess that would explain things. I'll be curious to learn how your new closing condition works. Thanks for coming to the rescue, again...

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I agree with you on your comments about the EA. Pls where can find the source code? I sent you a PM.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
@mrdfx, and @chrisdk2017, well done with the EA. Can any adjustment be made so the the trades that ends in breakeven is not a negative? That will help to reveal the actual accuracy of the win/loss statistics of the EA.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Very good idea using ADR20 %...however a disadvantage is getting stopped out at BE easily on the low volatility pairs (below 60 pips ADR20). A solution could be to open a second EA especially for the lower volatility pairs but then with higher ADR value about 130-150%. Just for fun and testing purposes I have enabled the Pivot S/R38 feature as well on ADR 100% EA...looks good so far: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #780 ---
The trick is mix EA ADR exit with pivots ( but discarding others EA tools in exits )

--- 帖子 #781 ---
I'm still testing daily Pivot with basket set at tp and sl at 60 pips. Already closed one basket in profit, and still foating in 30-40 pips. This week is so far nice. The "standard" daily got 26 pips profit and also float at 40 pips profit.

Today's EA Update with some intervention so far (GU from Ultron EA): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #783 ---
It is very early in my "no SL / min pip to close = 10 pips" test but it has recovered +25 pips so far for BE closes. Whether the recovered pips can cover non-recoverable trades (+2 weeks of holding) time will tell. More info: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=893732

Hi. What are your ea settings? Hi. What are your ea settings?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Why is there a long silence here?

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Kindly make available the settings Chris.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Now for a dumb question: in the EA settings, under MovingAverageType, is it the usual progression eg. 1=Close, 2=Open, 3=High, 4=Low, 5=Median Price (HL/2)...etc? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #803 ---
It's not been a good week for the EA or the strategy. We've had some strong trends on many pairs this week and as its always been one of this strategies weaknesses there were some losing trades. I was analyzing some of the results and settings that I'm using and made some updates to the ADR TS settings that I use which hopefully should help improve the results and secure more profits. I've set up 3 new charts for H1, H4 and D1 to do a little comparison between the TF and see how they go. I've removed all CHF &amp; NZD pairs as I really don't like trading them. Exciting times!

--- 帖子 #804 ---
@chrisdk2017 I just noticed something peculiar with a new order that should not have opened. It seems to have opened an order at an invalid pivot S138. In the EA settings SR138 is set to false so it should not trade. The price is also more than 20 pips from the S100 pivot. Can you take a look at the pivot code to see perhaps why this trade was validated by the EA? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Yes, you're right, strong trends this week causing huge drawdowns. I had to look back at the 4hrs timeframe too and realized, it would'nt have entered some of those loosing trades. But i can still see chf and nzd on your charts

--- 帖子 #806 ---
1.26 H4 defaults, no preset.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Looks like H4 is more stable and gives fewer losses than H1 even with the S138 bug. The S138 bug might have saved the EA this time but who knows. I am thinking of making another EA which can catch extreme movements like we just saw. The goal is to be able to run this on low leverage accounts because averaging in requires higher leverage or bigger accounts.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
So. do. set. file. Open the currency pair. Insert EMA . I select the period of EMA. I check the EMA settings on other currency pairs. For H1 . AU, EU, GU, NU, UC, EG _ EMA 24 / few false signals / . For H 4 . AU, EU, GU, NU, UC, EG, AJ, EJ, GJ, UJ, NJ, CJ _ EMA 12 / few false signals. / / signals are rarely generated : 1 signal 1-3 months / / good for medium-term trading / . D 1 _ EMA 6 / testing / . on other currency pairs. my broker has a big spread . for example / EN 16 points = 160 pips /

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Yes, i believe H4 is more stable than 1hr, But i hope you'll fix the S138 bug because this EA has a lot of potentials too.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Hey guys there's been an update to the EA and we now have v1.27. The first post has been updated! @chrisdk2017 thanks for putting your time and effort to help improve the EA. In this latest version some small bug fixes were made to the weekly pivot calculations and the ADR TS settings. I've also uploaded my personal current set files for H1, H4, and D1, so feel free to experiment with them and find your own best setting.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Hello from Ukraine. Good work. Thank you very much.

What are the recommended TF? Anyone a quick result?

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hi . Recommended is set by default. What pairs do You trade ? Here are the individual EA settings for currency pairs . https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post12241804

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Ok, I will report how it goes. Anyway, respect for the coder.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Sorry to ask, but how do we use: Which timeframe which Pivot time corresponds? 1H timeframe for example with daily Pivot or 1H Pivot? Is timeframe defined by the chart the EA is attached to? And what is CssTf timeframe? How to set? Same as Pivot?

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Pivot is by default weekly. CssTf is for currency strength, just ignore it, I think the results will be worse than without enabling Css.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Ok, I know that default is weekly. But what If I would like to tradeon 1H timeframe? Does that require 1H timefrmae for Pivot? Will need to change for example, maximum distance from pivot? I just noticed, css cannot be disabled, only you can select any TF.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
EA opened a sell trade against the rules. Red Arrow pointed up. Turbo_JRSX below 30 and pointing up. All candles well below EMA10. If EA followed the previous signal, then EA placed the trade 9 hours to late.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post12189103

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Hi . What Pivot level ? How many candles limit ? The value of the distance from the pivot ? What is the candle open a trade? This info will help understand .....

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hey guy its been a mixed bag this week and actually not much action for the EA's. H1 took a big hit this week and is the worst performer and H4 didn't have any orders this week, very unusual.. D1 still no orders since starting. I've been pretty bust this week and didn't have much time to monitor the EA's to see if all is correct. Lets see how next week goes!

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Maybe a trend filter would improve the results.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
I have been observing this method for a while now, and as good as it is, I think another filter would be a good idea. If the markets are heavily trending then this is the killer of any reversal type system. Does anyone have a suggestion of another filter that could be added to this system? Ideally one which stops us entering trades when the trend is too strong? Perhaps if the the ADX is above an extreme level then ignore the setup?

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hi. You can post the results of Testa with ADX ?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hello. EA SDTR has all the necessary filters . You need to understand how it works. For example for the USD at TF H1 the parameter EMA 36_48 , ZigZag 120_240 , Pivot 78_100 /rare Signals, / . Thank you master for EA .

--- 帖子 #747 ---
adding a 20 ema would improve it, https://www.theforexguy.com/forex-averaging-strategies/ Edit : for manual trading needs discretion

--- 帖子 #748 ---
This strategy looks pivot trading. Nice job

--- 帖子 #749 ---
With any kind of reversal based strategy strong trends will always be the weak point. This topic was discussed in great detail in the first thread, and many members had suggestions to try filter out those scenarios when a trade would open after a fake reversal and get stuck in a strong trend. So far there is still nothing that has proven itself effective in such a situation, although I am still open to ideas.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Unfortunately there is no solution to that scenario. The only way out is to take the loss after certain DD% and move on.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
This is just an idea, but perhaps see if price is ranging on higher timeframes, then it is more likely to reverse on a lower timeframe. If your using this system on the 4 hour chart for example, look on the daily and weekly timeframe for a ranging pair. This MTF ADX dashboard indicator may be a good start. It shows if a fx pair is ranging or trending on multiple timeframes. Again this is just an idea.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I might of found a way to improve this system by effectively combining it with another system. I dont want to start uploading my changes to this thread as I am still working on it, and I want to respect MRDFX since this is his thread, and I dont want to start uploading changes without his permission. I will carry on improving and testing my alterations, and if MRDFX does not mind me uploading what I have come up with then I will.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thanks Matthew What is the ToR1.2k.ea?

--- 帖子 #754 ---
It's a MTF ADX dashboard indicator.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I have the EAX MTF ADX pin. Because the name was different that's why I was asking.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
One idea. The combination of the Pivot and the strength of the currency . https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=532236 Tests these advisers have shown . The price indicator reaches a certain value . The EA opens a trade: for example, buy, but the price bounces and goes in the opposite direction / basically / . Dashbosrd Fibo v_3 opened a trade, the trade is still open . / opening beautifully / ...

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Hi How are you able to use custom indicators or EAs on MT4 MT5 mobile platforms? Your screenshot looks like MT4 mobile. Cheers

--- 帖子 #842 ---
You cannot see custom indicators or EA on mobile platform. If you look at carefully you can only see the orders

--- 帖子 #843 ---
The second picture is showing autofibotrending note. What is that?

--- 帖子 #844 ---
If you read back in the first thread you will see that we explored combining currency strength using CCFp and it did not have the most positive results.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Is this system possible with HA candles? Im glad this thread is alive.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I have not experimented much with HA and have no idea if it would make a big difference in results. Perhaps you can test it and share your feedback?

--- 帖子 #847 ---
This week it has been a relatively slow week for the SDTR EA. There were a lot of slow strong trending pairs this week due to all the global economic stuff going on. H1 took a hit this week as well as H4, and there has still not been any trades on D1. Out of the 3 TF I'm testing H4 is in a slight lead although not doing well either after this weeks loss. I have made some small adjustments to the settings and I'll be monitoring them next week to see if they improve the results. Have a good weekend guys!

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hi mrdfx av% = average daily percentage range. Av Bar = base from the average amount of candles C% = daily percentage movement W% = weekly percentage movement. B1, baseline Csm with the average candle. The sum of the total candle can be seen in the property B2 = have the same base with B1 with different calculation. I do not know what indicators are needed for these values. These values are good for rebound .

If you write anything on comment section it will show up exactly there when you look up on your mobile platform.

S.Wladimir I don't understand exactly what you trying to share?

Does anyone know how to get the support and restarts lines on the daily chart? Also would the S100 and R100 be considered a level be a major support and resistance

Hi https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post12189103

--- 帖子 #854 ---
That looks like a very complicated dashboard. Perhaps some inputs could help but i have no idea how to implement them to this EA.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Happy Friday guys. So today completes my one month test with the EA and some modified settings I was testing. Overall H1 was the worst performing time frame with -391 pips, and H4 was the most successful with +111 pips. During this month there were no signals on D1 time frame which is very surprising as I was expecting at least a few, not sure if it was my settings or the EA itself. I must admit I did not pay much attention to the EA and didn't cross check the signals to see if they were all 100% valid. I'm going to analyze the EA settings and try and optimize the TS as I think this is where I can improve the results and try capitalize on the profits and reduce the losses. It's been an interesting month with a lot of market uncertainty, volatility, and some strong trends, and for the EA to have made a profit during this month is a good sign of its potential. Have a good weekend all.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Interesting: From 6th May - today, H1: 194 pips. From 6th May - today, H4: 64 pips. D1 nothing here as well. H1 preset attached. Can you check which differences there are between mine and yours?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Nice Thread. Subscribed.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
So I had a look and most of the settings are the same with the major exception being the TS, and the MA setting you using. Only these 2 differences can be the reason why your results are different.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Hello mrdfx, I have started the EA with 15 pairs in 4H preset. Let's wait for its outcome. So far hadn't been consistent with an EA. Hope this time it will give a positive result. Anyway thanks for your hard work.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
I still can’t seem to figure out how to get the support residence to show properly on h1 and daily time frame.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hi chrisdk2017, There is another difference. Your EA trade 28 pairs (not 15 pairs) best of luck

--- 帖子 #862 ---
What S&amp;R? Use the template on first post to load all the indicators correctly as they should be used.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Got it! nvm thank you.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
I would really love if people can start posting there charts helps the learning experience.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Buy order opened earlier today on EJ on H4. All requirements was met and the EA was correct.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
HI Sergey, The EA didn't give a signal. But your entry was according to rules.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Better for you to trade manually.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
hi chrisdk2017, nice results. The .set files you are using from page 1? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
It also happened to me. Though I am using v1.27 from the first page

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Guys I have removed the EA from this thread and will no longer be using it. After monitoring the EA there were still come small bugs and unfortunately chrisdk2017 will no longer be assisting in the further development of the EA. I will revert back to manual trading only and post set ups when I get them. I am still open to another EA being created as I do believe its possible for this strategy to be automated successfully.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hi mrdfx, I am still doing the forward test at TF4. The main problem of this EA is that it opens multiple trades at the same price though "allow re-entries of the same pair" is set to false. But the filtering of this EA is nice. I like it.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Yes I still believe this EA has the potential to be profitable but unfortunately it still has a few bugs. I don't know anything about coding otherwise I would try to fix it myself or have developed it myself. We need someone with coding knowledge to come in and help fix the small bugs and then we can all enjoy the EA together.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Right you are. let's wait.

Can u inform me about the bugs that the EA is having now? Can we add another filter (as its performance in the hourly chart is not good)? If I have all the information I may talk to a coder. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
You say that the arrow repaints. Is it still possible to backtest this strategy?

--- 帖子 #876 ---
According to the rules in Post #1long trades should be taken only at levels, S61, S78, S100 only! Would you not take a trade at pivots with a higher number?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Does anyone know the sucess rate of this strategy using the parameters given in Post #1? Has anyone tried it using SMA5 instead o fEMA10?

Please can someone upload the set files. i dont see the indicators when i attach the template. i want to set them manually. thank you

Thank Master for your sharing and impressive method. Trend reversal trading always carry the risk when countering the waves, but always are very attractive to traders for huge profit. How do you think about adding the Divergence to confirmation of trend reversals more accurately?

--- 帖子 #880 ---
There is so much most people need to learn about the idea of PERSPECTIVE and RELATIVITY. An obvious trend on a large timeframe chart can and WILL have lower time frame charts cycling through down and up trends. These cycles on an m5 chart won't even register on a daily chart, but they can be PERFECTLY VALID up trends and down trends on the m5 chart! Don't try to say , "Oh, that's nonsense, because the m5 is too small." This whole idea of PERSPECTIVE and RELATIVITY means if you are given three charts to view without any indication of the time frames EXCEPT that the middle chart is 4x the smallest chart, and the largest chart is 4X the middle chart, you will see the SAME RELATIONSHIPS of trends and cycling among those three charts NO MATTER WHAT YOU USE for the smallest!!! Without any indication of the actual time frame, you would not know m1-m4-m16 from H1-H4-H16! Looking at charts of the CORRECT RATIOS of timeframes is the core of Intrinsic Market Timing (IMT). The "timing", that is, is it time to make an entry on chart X, is BUILT IN to the price movements that unfold over time on a series of charts. Using IMT, you will have few mistakes making "correct" entries. You WILL have some good entries that turn into losing trades because unexpected events can trigger an immediate move against you that runs to your stop. This does not mean that you made a WRONG ENTRY; it merely is one of the uncontrollable, unanticipatable events that sometimes happens. Same as with the reversal signals here. As some have already seen, you made an entry absolutely according to the rules of this system, but some event occurred after entry that resulted in a losing trade. If you find that over time your account is shrinking, even though you absolutely followed the rules, then clearly, other rules are needed that will reduce the number of entries that turn into losers. This takes time, work, and analysis of those losing trades to try to find out if they have some commonality that you can make use of to add a new rule to filter them out. So, let's say that you are watching the H1 for a reversal signal; you need to be checking H4 and m15 as a filters. If H1 is signaling a buy, how does the H4 chart look? Does it look like H4 is just now ready to go up, making a reversal from being in a downtrend, or does this look like H4 has been going up a while, has been in a pullback, and MAYBE will continue up, but no signal that it is reversing. If you see the former, then there is HIGH PROBABILITY that H4 is going to signal a reversal. Now, before just jumping in on the H1 buy signal, look at M15. Is it still going up, or is it either stalled or even going down now? Obviously, if it is going down, the H4 CANNOT POSSIBLY continue going up to make a reversal signal when price is going the wrong way! So now you need to sit and wait for m15 to SHOW YOU PROOF that the trend really is reversing on the larger charts. The proof is, if, during this time that the m15 travels down, the H1 does NOT also turn down before the m15 turns back up. Then when m15 turns up, look for the buy signals on m15, H1, and H4. Take the buys in order, as long as the price simply runs up. If you made buys on either m15 or H1 but H4 has not yet made the buy signal and then either m15 or H1 turns down, you once again must wait for the turn back up to CONFIRM a high probability that H4 will now signal a buy. (If BOTH m15 and H1 turn down, stop looking at m15; H1 must make the turn back up. That is your introduction to IMT as an additional filter.

TIP: When looking at price bars on a single timeframe, price has a tendency to run a Fibonacci number of bars between swing bars. Mostly, 3, 5, or 8 bars, 5 most common. So if you have 6 bars in an up leg, highly probable that it will go 2 more bars and swing down. If you have more than 8 bars, it is extremely over due to swing on that timeframe.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I will test your strategy and i have a request please Can anyone add alert to ZigZag Arrow indicator when new arrow added? Thank you @mrdfx for you strategy

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Thanks DrDave for explaining. Is there an IMT indicator?

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Turns out that every indicator that has some kind of crossing can be used. Also, indicators that mark swings, like the ZigZag, can be used. Below is combining the SDTR with IMT using the ZigZag so that you can have high probability of winning trades with little or no drawdown and avoid a lot of the SDTR entries that tend to be losers when a strong trend is running. IMT is a type of trend continuation strategy. (Advanced users can even trade the retracements!) This will NOT get you in at the start of a trend reversal on the H4. Instead, it gives you HIGH PROBABILITY of making a WINNING trade on the start of a trend reversal on m15. If it develops into a real trend reversal on H4, then you will also typically make an entry on the H1 very close to its reversal point. ZigZag Example: H4 just painted an up arrow. (Doesn't matter if the SDTR gives a buy entry or not at this moment). Immediately look at m15. It is highly likely that it is on an up leg, and the up leg should begin from an up arrow. Likewise for H1, except H1 will probably only have 1 or 2 bars in the up leg. With SDTR alone, you now are waiting for H4 to get the other indicators in order to make a buy signal. With IMT, you wait for m15 to do the normal cycling and continue up until it paints a DOWN arrow. This "downtrend" on m15 will show on H4 either as a small red bar (if the down move is weak), or an obvious down bar. On H1, it will show about 5 bars that either tend to go sideways, or that make an obvious pullback in the up move of the H1. (During this pullback, did H1 also paint a down arrow? If yes, then stop watching m15 and apply what follows to the H1). You will know that the m15 down trend is finished when an up arrow is painted. (Assume the case here that H1 did not paint a down arrow during the m15 down trend). Now that m15 painted an up arrow, simply wait for it to give an SDTR buy signal and enter. (Here, you thought we were watching H4 to go from making an up arrow to continuing on to give a buy signal, right? That is not not why we looked at H4. The new arrow on H4 SHOWED THE DIRECTION that we want to trade on the m15!). Exit: The simplest exit is to just wait for m15 to paint a down arrow and immediately exit. So now you can see how the market itself, by using the ZigZag arrows, SHOWS us the correct TIME to take action; Intrinsic Market Timing. Add-on entries: After your buy on m15, it is highly likely that you will soon get an SDTR buy signal on H1, and probably later see the SDTR buy signal on H4. If H1 buy signal appears, add on a contract. Simplest exit is still when m15 paints the down arrow. If H4 shows an SDTR buy AND m15 has gone less than 9 bars from its last up arrow, add another contract. Simplest exit is still when m15 paints a down arrow. (However, if the up move gave buy signals on all three of our charts, there are more advanced exit strategies that can be used to stay in longer.) In many cases, after the m15 exit, you will see a rather weak downtrend on m15 that hardly makes a dent in the H4, then m15 goes back up again, and think, "Whaaa??? Look at this crap system! I exited based on m15 painting a down arrow, but H4 kept going up! Look at all the pips I missed as H4 continues!" As I said above, m15 was the simplest exit. There are more advanced things to look at to be able to keep some contracts open to catch H4 if it continues up. The full IMT system would be using m15, m30, H1, H2, H4, H8, etc. But the chart time frames of MetaTrader do not enable the full chart range. I mostly use NinjaTrader so I can plot nearly any timeframe that I want to see. You can also check if there is a difference if you do not include the S/R signal rules: A green ZigZag Arrow will appear and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, S61, S78, S100 only! A red ZigZag Arrow will appear and be within the pivot level zone (0-25 pips) levels, R61, R78, R100 only! Try IMT along with the complete SDTR rules. Then later, go back to your charts and look at each case where the H4 painted a new arrow.\Now followthe IMT/SDTR system with the S/R rules and see if you would have entered a trade that was not taken when S/R rules followed. When S/R are omitted, does this result in more winning trades, fewer winning trades, or the same number? Does the number of pips gained increase, decrease, or stay the same? Does the drawdown during the time the trade is open increase, decrease, or stay the same? Answer these question for a minimum of 30 arrows painted on H4, and then use the data to decide if the S/R rules help you, hurt you, or make no difference. Do NOT base your decision ONLY on the total pips or on the number of winning and losing trades; base your decision on ALL of the factors for YOUR specific goals. Maybe YOU have drawdown as your major concern, whereas someone else does not even include drawdown in the decision.

I was doing some testing of the ZigZag Arrow indicator. I see that it repaints. That is, an arrow can be painted, then several bars later it disappears and is painted on a later bar. I will need to find time to either sit in front of the screen for several hours or else get out my screen recorder. I'll have to see if the disappearing act will have a negative impact on my planned trade strategy. Because of the repainting, it is not possible to scroll back on charts and evaluate what the arrows. Also, this means post #884 and #886 are not accurate, but they do explain the gist of the system.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
DrDave if you use indicator semaphortrue2 set at eindepth1=0, eindepth2=0, eindepth3=40 it will show past arrow signals. Handy for backtesting

I do have a question, looking at the chart we can see that on Friday i saw a valid entry off the r78, got an arrow and turbo was red, and friday at cole it crossed the MA, entered today after the open. Would the trade still be valid considering that this week open the pivots were changed? or would it still be valid from last week?

Hey everyone its been a long time. As successful as this strategy is and was proven to be traded manually, I'll be closing this thread. I have so many things going on and with my own personal trading, I don't spend much time anymore on FF, and can't dedicate enough time to manage this thread. You guys are more than welcome to continue to participate trading this strategy however it will remain in the recycle bin. Cheers guys and green pips to you all. EDIT: So Twee emailed me asking if I can keep the thread open as it adds value to the forum, so I will not be closing, but I won't be monitoring and managing the thread as before so if you do ask any questions please first check if its been answered already before expecting a reply. Thanks.

So its my first shot using this strategy, as well as input from the thread. AUDJPY - Sell SL - 75.450 TP - 74.900 - About 30 Pips, will monitor and may take 25 Pips Red Arrow / Zig Zag appeared within 25 Pips of R61 D1, H4, H1, and M15 all have the Red Arrow / Zig Zag triggered / reported D1, H4, H1 ,and M15 all are / were overbought according to the Turbo JSRX Indicator (and looked to be trending down) Candle closed below red 10 EMA line Ill keep you posted. Any feedback will help to ensure im looking at this right. Thanks for this mrdfx ***EDIT*** TP HIT!

Hi, First i would like to thank you for this strategy. I'm still using the old SDTR 1.25, the one with SR indicator, created by erwin-beckers I'm testing now with : SR indi set to 75, distance from SR set to 0 I've put the Weekly pivot indi on the chart Instead of MBFX, i'm testing with Blau's SMI or TVI (same thing) which sort of "volume" indicator, instead of using OB/OS indies. As a valid signal i'm waiting for : 1. Price hits or creates a SR 2. There's a weekly or daily pivot around 3. Price returns breaks MA of 7 4. SMI is divergent on H1 and M30 yes i have 2 charts, one on H1 with weekly pivot and one on M30 with Daily Pivots Still have no idea what AGE is . I've put "minsBetween2TradesOnSamePair" = 30, allow Reentries,SignalInvalidAfter = 12, SignalInvalidAfterPips = 1000 Changed the ZZ to 5 - 1- 3, news filter off, MBFX Length = 3 and filter 1 (no idea what that does) i'm trying to get rid of mbfx TrendLine = 3, period 5, (trying to get rid of this 2) SR Settigs &gt; Bars history = 75 and SR Details = Maximum MA = 7

--- 帖子 #905 ---
This strategy works, and the EA can work well if used as a semi-auto basis, for me at least. I'm primarily using it as a scanner, but for now I'm also testing automatic trades. I close the winning trades manually (and not get too greedy), and watch the ones in drawdown closely. Trades taken (1/2 alerted by EA in scanner mode, and 1/2 EA automatic trades) and closed in the last 24 hours.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Yes, we all got good results in the short run, especially with the complete automatic settings, using the EA. The issue is, for how long will your results be good before news spikes and unforseen market conditions eat your profit. Test it for 3 months upward before you give your judgement

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hey folks, nice trade first to say! Thanks for sharing. one question: is the ZigZag Arrow repainting?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hi, i've been trying the 1.26 version with Cur str meter activated. I was cheking the CADJPY pair and the only signal NOT valid is CC. I've seted to 15 min, then H1 and nothing. It hitted the Daily pivot 78, Weekly 100 and monthly 61, the price reversed and CC still not valid. Am i doing something wrong? My cur str meter is showing the pairs crossed eachother. Of course i don't need a Cur str meter to know they crossed along time ago. but still

--- 帖子 #909 ---
One more thing. I've been looking at Davits pivtos. Modified the indi a bit to show D,W and M in front, from Daily, weekly and monthly. I've been looking at CADJPY and saw what i think a reverse on the first screenshot, that would have been for me a "fake reverse", as price continued to go up. But looking closely it wasn't a fake reverse, it was a trade, a small one, but a trade nevertheless. So a trade might be between any pivots at any given time. For example, the price might hit a Monthly 61 Resistance, then reverse on a daily 100, after it went down only 20 pips, but it's a trade nevertheless. What i'm saying is that , could anyone modify the EA Pivot so that it include the same time the DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY PIVOTS at the same time but set the distance in pips from the pivot lower, let's say 10 pips , which is already included? So i this screenshot, the price hited the M61 resistance and i'm going to look closely and see when is going to return, might be any support, daily,weekly or montlhy. I'll try put my ideas in order and be more clearly next, sorry if i sound confusing.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
As i said, i look closely on CADJPY, just as an example. The price touched crossed the Weekly 61 and touched the Daily Pivot and reacted on the last. Still looking, probably on Monday. Later edit : OBV and AD made a support if you are in to this. These are 2 indies that i like alot. Edit 2 : What i'm saying is that i think you can use all 3 kind of pivtos (Daily, weekly and monthly) to be more precise on using entry point, lower SL and not using TP at all (the last will requier one not sleep at all )

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Here i am again poluting this thread. For those of you who feel that a indi or ea gives you to many alerts because you want small SL. I've added to my gmail a filter, if an email has GBPAUD included (for example) move it to GBPAUD category (it is not a folder), works with any word you want. Works if you wanna test an EA or an indi. It will give you alerts and you can check the time the alert was given and see what went right or wrong.

mrdfx thank you for sharing this strategy, whilst similar to others, the difference is, it tries to resolve the issue of zigzag repainting with pivot levels to determine if/maybe the zigzag leg has reached final resting place / trend is exhausted and ready for a reversal. I have coded an SDTR II Strategy arrow indicator based on the rules provided. The indicator must be placed in the same folder as the strategy indicators. The strategy indicators must be named as follows: -3c_turbo_jrsx_filtered -ZigZag Arrows -Pivot_Voty (put a dash "-" in front of the indicator names and resave in indicator folder) for the arrow indicator to work. From feedback I have added V1.2 where the names do not need to be changed. More than one arrow may occur for a given signal due to how the rules are coded given the candle cross related to the zigzag arrow. At present this is up to 11 candles apart and seems enough on 1H and 4H chart, have not tested on 1D chart. It also allows for the zigzag arrow to be within the current pivot zones or the last pivot zones. This is because on testing on a number of occasions the zigzag arrow occurred just after the last pivot zones expired and these seemed to be good trades. There is also a jrsx filter which is for setting if you wish this indicator to be above of below a certain value when the candle cross occurs. I have put an expiry date on the indicator as members continually fail to provide me any feedback so that indicators can be improved. If the indicator is considered to add benefit and there is constructive feedback I may develop further and post updated versions; maybe even an expert advisor.

Use the following indicator to show the repaint of the Zigzag indicator and therefore other places that may meet the rules but not favourable. Zigzag indicators look great in retrospect but repaint in realtime until they fulfill the maths equation. So it is important to see the past repaint and determine for yourself a strategies pros and cons. I also want to state my indicators are free and there is no hidden commercial agenda or plans to sell the indicators and/or EAs. The interest/challenge for me is to describe human observation as code; which is difficult and rewarding.

Hi Ronin, Thanks for the SDTR II Arrow and Zigzag history indicators, both seem to be working fine. However, there is an issue with the SDTR II Arrow indicator; the direction arrow for SELLS, prints an UP ARROW instead of a Down Arrow. While fiddling with it I noticed that it was the BUY ARROW Settings that was controlling both BUY/SELL ARROW settings. Whatever settings inputted into the BUY Arrow settings dominated the other. Thanks for you work once again and hope you have time to check it up. Cheers.

Thanks RapzyFX for the feed back; apologises for the coding error. Please find attached a version with fix applied.

Hey Ronin, Congrats to your nice Indicator. Looks pretty good! I am currently testing it and doing some forward testing. For now it gives good signals and I am using different settings for filtering out the good and bad ones. Some feedback regarding the plotted pivot lines...maybe you could add a "hidde" and "show" option for plotting the lines on the chart. Currently they are shown all the time and might be overloading the chart depending on what already is being plotted with other indicators and such...they might even not be shown at all because if using the pivot indi by itself it gives more displaying options in general. So I don't know if you want to plot the pivot lines in your indicator at all. Checking the Alert Options doesn't seem to work either consistently...turning them off but receiving alerts anyway. The Indicator is definetly beneficial because it simplifies the rules and what is shown on the chart. I do have questions though... Can you explain why your indicator doesn't show arrows in the first case and does show arrows in the second case? Both are in the timeframe H4. Might just be a mistake on myside or just a logical misinterpretation of the rules from me... Case 1 is with ZigZag highs but the rules of the SDTR seem to apply and your indicators doesn't show arrows. Case 2 is with a previous ZigZag low and the rules seem to apply as well and your indicator does show arrows(orange). I am a bit confused by it. Greetings

Hi Everyone, Hope your well and safe. Apologises I have busy with life at the moment. Thank you for the feedback. Next week I will go through the feedback, answer questions and post the indicator again with any updates. I have not posted the EA as the indicator which the EA is to be based on must be optimised first. I currently focus on mql4 and NOT mql5 as I would have to rewrite all my scripts. This is what mladen has done if you look at his mql4/5 pages. It is ashame that metatrader have decided to do it this way.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Dear h0oo0h, Thank you for the message and feedback / questions. I have checked the alarms via the strategy tester there did seem to be an issue; hopefully resolved now. Also reduced the number of arrows appearing per signal. I will post the indicator next week as still some testing to do. As for the pivots appearing, this is because I'm using the indicator directly without any changes. I maybe able to change this. I have reviewed the scenarios presented and answered below: Case 1: The reason an arrow(s) was not seen on 30th April 2020 on the 4hr chart for AUDCAD at 00:00 is because the zigzag in the indicator is set for 40,5,3 as default and not 12,5,3 as per the zigzag arrow indicator. I cannot remember why I set it to 40,5,3. This may be due to what I have read in this forum or because the 12,5,3 setting for zigzag has a lot of noise. I tend to go for 40-60,5,3. I hope this answers your question. If you are able to share the other filters used I might be able to incorporate them into the indicator.

An EA with this fantastic strategy, I think excellent results are needed, just manage the stop loss well, is there anyone who is trying to develop it?

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Hi Jupiterix, I have created an EA for this strategy based on the indicator I have provided. However more optimisation is required of the indicator first. If you put the indicator on a chart and eye ball over the last year there are quite a few losing trades. Yes this can potentially be managed with SL, trailing stop etc.. These are all included in my EA. But indicator first as feedback so far shows I few coding issues / discrepancies that I am keen to resolve first before re coding the EA and providing it for testing. I will provide an updated indicator next week as the provided inidcator has now expired. I'm adding some new features based on Davit method. Please remember, I put expiry dates within my indicators and version v1.3 has expired. This is why I will publish the indicator with updates next week.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
[quote = Ronin-; 12982618] Ciao Jupiterix, ho creato un EA per questa strategia sulla base dell'indicatore che ho fornito. Tuttavia, prima è necessaria una maggiore ottimizzazione dell'indicatore. Se metti l'indicatore su un grafico e un bulbo oculare nell'ultimo anno, ci sono parecchi scambi in perdita. Sì, questo può essere potenzialmente gestito con SL, trailing stop ecc. Questi sono tutti inclusi nel mio EA. Ma l'indicatore prima come feedback finora mostra che ho pochi problemi / discrepanze nella codifica che desidero risolvere prima di ricodificare l'EA e fornirli per i test. La prossima settimana fornirò un indicatore aggiornato poiché l'inidcator fornito è scaduto. Sto aggiungendo alcune nuove funzionalità basate sul metodo Davit. [/ Quote] Thanks, I'm very happy, if you want to participate in some tests so as to be able to provide feedback to optimize the system.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Regarding Case 1. Below is the difference between 12,5,3 zigzag at the top and 40,5,3 zigzag at the bottom. With 12,5,3 zigzag there are occassions as circled when a sell signal occurs and price goes in the other direction see yellow circles. Yellow squares = sell, blue squares = buy. This is just an example of what I see when looking over a few years of data. Yes this can be potentially be controlled by SL, trailing SL etc but in my experience to control these situations means the gains of good trades are limited; in turn it becomes a scalping strategy. Given there are not many signals relatively speaking this means the strategy becomes at best a slow growing investment. This is why further optimisation is suggested as my testing is showing there is a trade off between good signals and the number of signals. Less signals is fine if the pips per month generate an ok profit. I do advocate putting the indicator on a chart, zooming out and manually eye balling the signals to see if most look profitable or not.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Thanks a lot to everyone who participated in the development of this strategy. Ronin, I know that you are now optimizing the indicator with the arrow. Please, while it’s not ready, you can again post here the expired version of the indicator with arrows.

Seems this thread is like dead.... i asked me long ago why this is so because this here is high structured and the david pivot thread which is organized like a beach after a tsunami is successful....

Remove all bad stuff and replace it with the tools the professional trader use: - TUX completely useless because an EMA 200 shows us the distance between it and the price-&gt;use EMA 200 for trend - Turbo RSX is a cheap copy of the Mining ??? indicator... better stoch or the stochrsi indicator of the tradingview site...use it with period 14,14 - I use my own pivot indi... much more eye friendly...if U want to win the race... every detail and optimization is important...

Some more thoughts about this strategy: - If you have a trend indicator...what for ...here I would trade against then trend... yes i know they will cruzify me.... - H1 is much too large for this... I would prefer M15 like the guys in the pivot thread where every guy has another strategy and other indicators... - Whats important from my point of view? To be FAR from the average= pivot middle line - When trade to the middle line? When the stochrsi "drives" in this direction ....leaves the ob/os zone... so easy... - You say the EMA 200 is not needed? U r 100% right.... - You say EMA 21 is not needed? U r 100% right again.... - You say this is now simple and profitable to trade? U r (maybe) 100% right again.... Maybe successful like my new EA too...
