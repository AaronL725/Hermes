5m Kevinator retracement system Majors only(eurusd*usd/chf*gbpusd*aud/usd*usd/cad)5 m chart only.

This system is a trend following system that uses the multi time frame stochastics as a definition of the current trend the market is in. If the market is stepping up then you take buy retracement bars.If the market is stepping down you take the sell retracement bars.

Retracement bars are the magneta(purple) bars on the indicator on the bottom.If the market is stepping down you take the downward magneta bars as entry.If the market is stepping up you take the upward magneta bars as entry.

LONGTERM

You can either enter the market (long term) when the mtf stochastics is changing directions and hold until trend is done or at any of the retracement bars going in the direction of the trend and hold (20-400pips)

SHORTTERM

You can scalp the market by finding the direction of the current trend (stepping up or stepping down) and entering the retracement bars and taking 5 to 20pips profit.

There are two ways to trade this system but the entry rules are solid.We have a solid method to define a trend (mtf stochastics) and a solid entry method ( enter on retracements).

It is up to you how much profit you take as you could be following a trend for days or just scalping all day long for short profits.

UPDATE /1/

*Retracement finder modified fix to display magneta on current bar (0) attached***********

UPDATE /2/

*Double woody CCI added to replace rf finder as well as autotrendline for more visual confirmation.

Thanks alot.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Kevinator judging from the first couple of pages I have to say I like your style!!

I've seen on a couple of trades posted you have gone against the step of the stoch, it'll be interesting to see how many trades you take at price extremes where trend in terms of your stoch definition hasn't turned.

On the template provided the retracement finder didn't load. When I put the indi in myself there is no magenta option, colours 0 and 1 are black, 2 white, 3 yellow, 4 aqua. Which one should be magenta?

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Pls can you kindly attach the system rule in MS WORD 2003/2005 as the extension type isnt opening here cos of the veersion of MS word Im using

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Same as wording per 1st post it seems.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
2003/2007 doc

--- 帖子 #30 ---
********Read the first page for the rules**************************

Maybe it is your broker but system and template loaded fine on my broker.

Sometimes I take trades without mtf stoch direction.Usually retracement off way overbought or oversold conditions TMA.After eying trades for hours on end you can anticipate some conditions.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
You guys get organized and work out the details.I have a few more trades to take then I will nap for a few hours.If you still dont get it just look at a few trades.Still dont get read the first post.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Kevinator is busy at the moment. If anyone can confirm that the indi colours number 2 is not white but magenta I'd appreciate it. If magenta is not 2 which is it. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
hope this helps

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Where do you put your stop loss?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks you're a star.

Any chance you could confirm the settings A period 8.0, B period 8, neutral 0. I'm getting quite a few differing signals from K's posted charts and whilst there can be broker differences on candles etc seems strange to have quite that many.

Thanks again.

All these trades are from sunday est 5 till right now.I dont know what to tell you except maybe think and get your charts worked out for yourself before you post your doubts and such.

Its all live and its all current.If I posted all I have from the past we would be 15 pages deep on day 1.You can see exactly what I am doing and how I am doing it.I encourage you to take some of this knowledge and make some money at a higher pace.

hi

ur retracement finder indy... is it repaint?  thx

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes this is exactly as I have it, thanks. Now the research begins ..........

--- 帖子 #42 ---
The retracement finder is just a CCI of 8 periods with +50 and -50 levels , at least if Kevinator didnt change anything

--- 帖子 #43 ---
No it will not repaint.

Here is a few old 100pip trades from last week or the week before or something.I dont usually save all the pics but here is a few.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thats not a very wise idea , this may work sometimes , but TMA Bands are repainting very much , like the CoG they show perfect results in hindsight .

I added a non repainting TMA version so that you can compare

--- 帖子 #45 ---
thx kevin

because just now, in 5m chart of eurusd the purple bar didn't appear... but when i change to 15m tf, and then back to 5m... it's appear there...

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Not as far as i know, this was already discussed if i remember well.

But the TMA Bands does, this is guaranteed (just check Nanningbob's threads): they are 100% true if looked in real time, but overfits the past.

If you wanna do some backtest try the TMATrue indicator, that is an honest one

Interesting thread by the way, it's not really my trading style but i like it, well done Kevinator!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
dear KEvinator,

what is the profit and loss for this system, what percentage is it profitbale and how are you going with your live results? how many trades have you taken and what percentage has been profitbale also what level stop loss do you use?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Do you need to fuss about TMA, its not even mentioned in first post?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Well Kevinator uses the TMA and at least one guy here was already taking trades of the TMA Bands only , so its better to inform the people that this indicator repaints allthough it isnt an essential part of the strat

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Every trade you see in this thread are from sunday 5pm est until right now the trades which I am currently still in aud/cad/gbp.So if you can count for yourself and see how many that equals.

I trade when I am awake morning noon and night although if you are just beginning I would recommend london newyork session as it is fast paced.

TMA--If you have been trading long enough you will notice that almost every mt4 indicator will redraw itself in some way.

I know new traders brains just want to find that one indicator to use as a standalone.Unfortunately this does not exist so we use a combination of indicators in a "system" to get around this problem.

Redrawing would be a problem if we just used one indictor but since we use multiple indicators it is not a problem.

Also our trigger which is retracement finder does not redraw only the magneta does not refresh once loaded.I have been using it so long I dont even notice I just take the first bar up or down and keep it moving.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thank you so much for sharing this. You are awesome!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi kevinator,

I like your system. Are you on demo only or do you trade on live account with this system, too?

Could please explain a little more how you would set the stop loss and exit your trades?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hello. Tried to load up your template and it keeps crashing on me. Anyone else had the same problem?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I don't usually go to forums and do my own trading most of the time but some days I will stop in and do some live trades for the whole session.

You must figure your own stoploss and take profit.I sometimes take 10pips and sometimes let trades run for 150+ it all depends on the time of day,session, and whats going on.

I am not trying to manage your money I am trying to put you on better trade setups in order for you to be successful.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Here is alternative mtf stochs.You must input 60 for tf and settings are 14,3,3.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
kevinator...

I have a strategy similar to yours and it works great

but I use h4 Stoch mtf

Greetings.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
porfirio

Is that a customised Stochastics you're using? It looks much smoother than the standard indicator

Thanks

Andy

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I do not like the CCi as a trigger I think it looks to messy although the rest of the system looks good.

The gold is the original of my system and I also have prototype #2 which I have posted on other forum.

I did not want to release it yet for fear of confusing traders.It is too early as they have not absorbed the information on post 1.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Kevin and all..

I got this one live going on as it was a pretty good setup..

I tried to get confirmation on two setting in your stoch indy... (60 red and 240 green)..

would the combo confirmation give a better success ratio (hit ratio)?

Thanks.

Dean

--- 帖子 #60 ---
hi andy b,

the truth is that I do not remember what page you got, maybe out on ForexFactory ... I'm sorry but I do not know

in any case if you want here is friend

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Impossible to backtest.  The MTF Stoch repaints back 4 bars.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thats a good trade...your getting it.If you stay in step with the direction of the market you will be fine.

I say direction and not trend because some days the market will not be trending and you must be able to find your bearings and navigate the terrain on mtf stochs only.

I use tma as a visual as I never want to feel stuck in the middle of the market.We are always going some were.I think in terms of beginning and end and not the middle.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Sorry, I didn't make myself clear, it was the Doda Stochastic i was looking for

--- 帖子 #64 ---
That is correct mtf stoch does repaint.If we used it as a standalone indicator it would be a problem but since we use it in a "system" of indicators we should be ok.

Why dont you take a few hours and forward test it.

Be awhile before I post new trades I have everything in positive territory on hold as of now some 40 to 70 pips positive with no more possible positions to be opened margin wise.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for the reply..

I closed this one for +40.. but that's just me managing my money and first dip at your sys..

I sure do understand your point about the Direction & Trend.. one must have the ability to get his chunk or at least not get lost when the direction don't pan out to a Trend.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thanks for the replies guys, looks like a very interesting thread

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Looks interesting, will start forward testing from here.

thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Kevin, I got one question..

in my chart I have marked a signal that it looks pretty valid... but it turned out to a very quick fake out.. (not a problem it happens to any system)..

I would like to get your feed back on how do you handle such situations..

-do you bear with it with stoch steps as it goes to such deep loss (about 25 pips)?

-do you cut the loss once it crosses the Pullback mark?

or... ?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Shouldnt a 1h stoch  repaint 12x5min bars back ? Or do you mean it repaints 4 hours back ?

Basicly you have to refresh the mtf-Stoch every hour right?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Pls don't shout at me that this is not part of system but the prev 1 hr candle closed with a massive lower wick so there were some buyers around and the daily pivot 4649/50 psych level combo needed a little more time to break through. It happens.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Exit out of there and wait for the next setup.It is like tennis*******you don't have to win every game to win the set.

At the end of the day the winners far outweigh the losers.It will take time to get used to the system and begin to anticipated trades based on market movement.

Hi folks,

When  I load 5mkevinator retracement.tpl  to my mt4 platform, it freezes. It happens everytime I attach the template. What could be the problem?

Any help is appreciated.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks for the reply..

I was just wondering WHEN or HOW to go about exiting such situations ..  my concern is between premature exiting and getting stuck...

what when where would be a good timing..

you don't have to answer.. lol.. i know i am being a pain in butt, my apologies ahead.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Kevin- really diggin the system-thanks for sharing.

Live trade guys.. another winner..

Mediator,

Thanks for the alert brother.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
the problem i saw while screentime is, that if you got an LONG signal because stoch step up, and then the price goes down, the stoch also 'repaint' and step down.

this happens to me with the last BUY signal @EURUSD here the stoch was step up and after the hour was over the stoch closed with step down.

this is why i got now SELL signal like P.Dan at this point the stoch step up. i know this is a common problem with MTF indicators

Mediator

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Dean,

Mind to share where did you find the entry signal?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Live Trades, 4 losses and one winner. All depending on SL.......

Any comments??

--- 帖子 #88 ---
the way i have worked out for myself as i have kind of combined with my own system, is to have the combo stoch 60 and 240 to be in the same direction for the confirmation of the retrace finder magneta signal.. so for example the long RF signal will be filtered..

on the same token... you will miss some opportunities but it saves and filter a lot of quick turned price losses.

anyways that's my 2cent.

by the way i closed for another +40...

Thanks to Kevin and all.. see you tomorrow

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Mediator,

Thanks for the email function, you rock. I noticed the same thing with the stoch, was just watching it on the EU as well. Not sure how to fix this but I am happy with what we have. If anyone has any ideas, please share...

Thanks again,

Dan

Update: Just took a look at The Doda-Stoch that Kevin posted...

I noticed that the Stoch helps.  The MTF stoch we are using has a regular stoch availabe that can be shown in the same

window.  It is the first stoch option, just leave the time period set to 0, and set the Show Stoch to true.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
there was a RF bar.. very small one on a small candle.. so I just waited from that point on for the smallest price hesitation to set my order from there.

I hope it helps..

Hi Kevinator and Porfirio,

Thanks for very good informations. I am testing this strategy.

Porfirio, can you attach yor indis and template ?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Are u guys using the TMA bands when price is at the highest and you get a sell signal, then the probabilities is better? and vice versa?

So u will for instance not sell when u get a signal and price is at the lower TMA band??

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Trade taken just as the mtf stoch steps up.Was on hold but exited on the overbought TMA.25 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Some of the best trades are taken when mtf stoch is trending in one direction and price pulls back to the opposite TMA then you take the next retracement bar in the direction of the trend.

If you trade in this way you will never lose one trade although you will have to wait for trade setups.If you scan many pairs you will have a more productive session.

Let me clarify what I just said...If mtf stoch is trending in one direction.....then Price in the TMA band will go in the opposite direction until it hits the band in the opposite direction of Mtf stoch........then you will take the next retracement bar in the direction of the mtf stoch..

It is like standing in front of a object with a ball in your hand...winding back and throwing the ball forward.

Pullback then major energy release...

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Followed the hard rules of the system for a quick 10pips.Will hold looking for 20.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hello Kevinator,

i did not understand how you got this entries? if you look at the last three pictures you posted and if i understand your rules correctly an entry would only be after a magenta retracement bar occur. but in your charts your entries are while a retracement bar occur. only after the bar will close you'll see if it will be a magenta bar and not while it forms. i see you put vertical lines at the bars and have your trades entries at the open of an unformed magenta retracement bar. how you did this?

cheers

Hi Kevinator,

I see the trade /short USDCHF/ swinged the wrong way. What are the options now? Will u exit with loss OR wait and see?

Cheerz,

--- 帖子 #99 ---
The retracement finder indicator has a refresh problem.Once it is loaded It will not show magneta on the current or future bars.There is a updated  version on the page before this one.

In the rule this was show to illustrate exactly how to trade the system and at which points to take positions.

Even if the indicator does not show magneta it really does not matter.

Very simple rules...Look at the mtf stoch for direction. Enter on the RF indicator bar in that direction.

So if mtf stoch say market is stepping up you will wait until rf finder indicator has bar up.Vice versa on the opposite trade.

Or you can take the pull back trade like in one of the pictures.That is the safest trade to take although you will have to wait for the setup.If you are impatient I suggest opening many charts and scanning them all.At the least you will begin to learn market movement.

Tradiing during the london and newyork session yields the best results.I trade all day so now 10,20,30 pips unless aussie news .Later 20 to 150pips moves.

You will have to learn to navigate the terrain and pick your spots.You will also have to learn to manage your money correctly.I am here to put you on more trade setups.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
thx you so much for your method kevinator !

mediator, thx for your modified indicator !

i think then i can do a EA of this system, easily (with icustoms methods)

i will try too in M30 and mtf stoch H4 !

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I think this where you went wrong on those 4 trades you posted earlier. They were on the wrong side of the bands. Im only taking trades that havent crossed the centre line of the bands in the direction i want to go.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Kevin...

Well thought out system. Seems easy to follow. Will try a few trades to see how it goes in real time.

--- 帖子 #103 ---

Hi Guys,

Do I need to re-attach the template every 5 min to get the latest signal? So sorry to ask as I do not know how to use re-paint indicator.

I've notice, every time I re-attached the template, I'll get different signal/result.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Guys,

Hope somebody can guide me here. By looking at the current market / chart as per attached, what should I do?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Kevinator, thanks for sharing the tips, your a cool dude

think Im ready to test

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I entered on the open of the candle with the green line through it. We had a pullback after that but did not come anywhere near my stop loss. Stop loss was below the last swing low about 11 pip risk.

Mtf stoch stepping down and coming in off overbought conditions for the momentum trade/Held open for sometime but eventually closed for 35 + positive.

Good going dave,,nice looking trades there.

hey how come I got so much going on in my stoch and you guys only have one line?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
There are new traders here that are just learning and I do not want to discourage or derail there thinking with my numbers.

You have to use the template as the mtf stoch is modified so you only have attention to 60m bar,

--- 帖子 #123 ---
i'd like to ask again and boy2boy asks the same question. how do you determine your entry at the candle you marked with the red vertikal line.

you will see in my picture that the real entry would be on the open of the next candle later with the blue line i marked.

everyone say that sticking to the rules is important. esspecially for newbies it is important to show real entries. if you mostly perfect in reading the market so you don't need the retracement indicator, which is in its simplest form the CCI(8).

Cheers

Mediator

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Look at the Tma.It is so overbought and the retracement indicator is getting lower and lower and lower.

After sometime using the system anticipation will come naturally.I want you to trade in higher gear than you are used to trading.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I need an alert added to this indicator when it will change fibo placement and audible alert.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
mediator,

don't make it to complicated for yourself bud.. just do whats comfortable and right for yourself.. go with close RF bar and get in on the next candle with 2-3 buffer + spread.. or..

Kevin might be doing the same or getting in earlier or etc.. he is more experienced at this and knows the ins and outs of his style.. he probably knows how to get out of one if he has jumped gun or not..

sorry for intrude... just looking to help.

it looked for moment to make bullish burst but it got stumped..lol..  its ok still alive with a fairly tight sl... it remains to be seen..

there was nice signal on usd/cad.. nice overbought one for reversal..

did anybody get that?..  my alert on that pair for some reason was off.. bumer..

P.Dean,

Get the money and go on to the next trade.

The type of trade that you hold is a pullback reversal.

1)you see how the mtf stoch is stepping up.

2)Price pulled back to oversold

3)price sling shot to the top

reverse conditions for short hold conditions

This is a momentum trade as trend is up and market pulled back to oversold but 60m mtf stoch says trend is still up.You take the next bull bar and hold.

Thats how you make most of your money for the day.

This is the safest and easiest way to trade this system.You will only get a few trades a day but they will be full of value.I on the other hand want it all and you will too when you realize how much extra money is readily available.

Got in on the eurjpy trade positive 15.Gonna bank it and move on.

Excellent,

Moving along I am up 25 on eurjpy oversold and now exit.Scanning for more now.

We just missed the mom trade on audusd.See how mtf stoch says long.Price pulled back to ovesold and slingshot to the top.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
sorry did not have time to show this live.. but got +12 out of it one clear bull signal..  thought might help some of you to see more charts..

--- 帖子 #139 ---
that be prediction brother... and I for one stay far away from that..

plus in this thread just as the founder Kevin has suggested is to keep scanning and keep on banking reasonably... before you know it at end of the day or week you will have bag full of pips... sure pips and not relying on what who might do or don't..

thanks for your input anyhow.. that's just my two cent and going along with the flow of the thread.. which it fit my style and mind set towards trading.

happy piping to everyone..

--- 帖子 #140 ---
We missed three MOM trades here.We have to get to the point that we do not overlook anything.If it moves and its profitable its going in the bank.We have to do better.

See how mtf stoch 1hr trend is in one direction but price pulled back to the opposite TMA band then sling shot to the top or bottom.That is the bread and butter trades that last for hours sometimes and yield between 20 and 150 pips.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
that's a great bank on E/J Kevin...  well done to show it live.. thank you.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
it's really interestin system and how your making money with this.most thing i like about this is that your showing this live...but looking at things, i have reallized i dont see your SL and TP when you enter. is there specific SL or TP your looking for? thank you,

--- 帖子 #143 ---
this is a nice show of charts and inputs Kevin, thanks..

I went big on that G/U trade and kind of over my comfortable zone margin wise and just could take advantage on one which was the A/U...  but now i get it as to spreading it around and scanning for all to make quick banks and maybe get one that will run big..

you right we must get better at scanning.. I am with you brother..

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I have to go now as I must get some sleep.I have family members who need my assistance in the morning.

Market is hot so you should be able to fire at will.

Your goal during the day is at least 4 MOM trades daily lookin for 30 to 50pips then all the extra 10 pip runs you can do before you fall asleep at the screen.Mom trades are the bulk of your daily cash the rest is just extra if you feel like it.

This type of trading is like tennis "you don't have to win every match to win the set".

Also that usd/chf trade we missed was a MOM also.

Boy2boy,  Post 105

Years ago I read this quote that has remained with me since

“the market has spoken…………..were you listening?”

I think of this each time before placing a trade, so in looking at the GBP/USD chart you posted, the thing that immediately hit me was that the previous 15 bars had gone sideways with a range of just 8 pips.

Question to self:  Do I want to take a trade just because an alert has gone off for this chart?

Answer: No, there has to be a better opportunity either now, or soon on some other currency that is not ranging.

It’s a great little system. Just take some time and watch the charts to see what happens to get a feel of the method.

I dont think thats a MOM trade, it was at the bottom of the TMA when u got the sell signal.

But what do u think of this one instead?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I have a question.  If we get a signal, say short, and price is already at or below the lower band of the TMA, should we pass?  In this GU example, we would have made +10 quickly even though our entry is 3 pips from the lower band.  The EJ, for example was already touching the lower band by the time we got the signal and we would have sold on the low.

Also, where do you put your stops?

Thanks a lot for doing this!

0925 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/CHF above 0.8390 suggests more gains, says Barclays Capital, but only as far as the May lows at 0.8460. The bank says only above 0.8555 would alleviate the current bearish outlook for the rate. USD/CHF is now at the day's high of 0.8412. (gary.stride@dowjones.com)

I put a buy on this is it correct?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
That depends totally on your risk. If u take it then maybe go in with half or less and only aim for 10 pips TP. Its a risky trade.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
that would be correct, but still over the middle half, so aim for less TP.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
you were right I almost got to the TP but did not close it and now I am waiting for another chance.

I do hope thats -26.5

--- 帖子 #160 ---
That is a joke right?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
i don't think so my friend..

I wait for the RF bar to close than I enter on the next candle.. 2-3 pis buffer plus spread.. and that's what i have done there.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Ok I didn't realise you had a buffer, I thought the idea was to enter at the start of the next candle.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I dont see any point in google a fundamental view on what banks are holding their hats on to where price might go. They have 1 interest and 1 interest only. And it is certainly not on a 5 min timeframe where u aim for 10-20 pips in TP.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I give my humble take on your trade..

I think you are mixing the over bought/over sell reversal trade with the MOMO trade.. in your chart your taking a reversal off the overbought situation..

my trader..

i have given full visual explanation in the chart picture..

that's the way I saw it and took the trade..

i hope it clears away..

happy trading to all..

thanks for your help on indi problem.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Ok guys...

I thought I'd lend Kevin a hand and provide some basic training in PA and reading the indicators. So pull up a 5M GU chart and follow along.

You can see from the open of today (Friday) price sort of slowly made it's way higher but with no real momentum to speak of. We have a long period of consolidation (between re lines) and we see the stoch is over 80 but very flat. During the London session price makes a nice run up and creates a higher high but note that the stoch stays basicly flat even during what appears to be a nice run up. When I see a run up to a new high like that and the stoch doesn't respond that tells me that there's not alot of momentum behind the push higher. What I look for next is price to start making lower highs and the stoch to step down below the 80 level. As you can see on the first red arrow price comes down but doesn't quite make it tot he bottom of the TMA band but that's ok. Next I wait for a retrace to the upper band and see if price gives me another swing top that is lower than the last high. Low and behold we get the retrace to the upper band (second red arrow). Once we get the second retrace I start to get real interested and start to watch what price does around the upper band. Next you see a small pin bar form at the band high and the next candle is a nice bearish push down. Notice where the stoch indicator line is, it just stepped down below the 80 level. At the close of the bearish candle I would enter (green line) at 1.6427. My SL would go above the last swing high which is the first red arrow. Price makes it's way down to the bottom TMA band for a 14-16 pip gain. On the retrace indicator I like to see the bars come up on the positive side and then go below the zero line. The bar on the retrace indy doesn't necessarily have to turn magenta/red for me to enter the trade. I just like to see the indy bar go below as the bearish candle closes.  Now we wait to see if we get another retrace and price makes it's way back up to the upper band. Now we wait and watch what price does. Again, the stoch is still stepping down and price gives us a nice bearish candle as the retrace indy bars go below zero (3rd red arrow). I would be in at 1.6417 (green line). Also note we have another lower high formed.

I hope this doesn't confuse anyone. If you're patient and wait for the retraces you can put the odds in your favour.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yes precisely, on a 5 digit broker you were still only -26.5 pips, the 5th digit is a 0.1 of a pip.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Guys...

Just one more chart showing what's happened to the GU after the big 80 pip move down.

After the big move down price starts to go up and then back down this goes on for some time and you realise that we are in some type of consolidation pattern again (red lines). Take a look at the stoch during the consoildation. It's below the 20 level and basicly flat. Now you could take a long trade when the consolidation breaks but I would want to see some confirmation before I go long. Looking at this chart conformation would be for price to go above the aqua horizontal line at the last major swing high. Take a look at the swing A-B all the price action in the consolidation phase is inside of that last swing. For price to go significantly higher it has to break the swing high at 1.6438. Even if we break the consolidation area to the up side if price doesn't make it past 1.6438 and it turns around and starts lower price will have form another lower high within the A-B swing (see the aqua zig zag lines).

Maybe I am complicating things for some of you, but if you start to learn this stuff you will put the odds on your side and your winning percentage will go up significantly.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Far from complicating things your expanations make things a whole lot easier

For this newbie anyway......

Same trade as eurchf and eurusd.Got in late but I noticed mtf stoch stepping up and there was a break in the bull candles of retracement finder then it resumed so I pulled the trigger and walked with another 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Correct trade setup according to hard rules.All indicators aligned so trade entered and 15 pip banked.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Kevin i banked +12 on that one..  i worked off and on today but went on a 5-1 run for +48... thanks..  but i just checked and between my five major pairs that i trade there as about 20 opportunites which would have given a 80% hit ratio.. so I gotta scann better and be on top of to catch more winners like you keen mentioning..

would you mind to share the new stoch indi with the red and green steps show.. Thank you.

Hello P.Dean,

thanks bud appreciated..

I am on this e/u trade same as yours.. but my profit did never reach more than +12... which makes me wonder if there is better entry than what i take, which is wait for the close candle of the RF bar then 2-3 pips buffer + spread..

if you may elaborate on the better entry or how you do it I will greatly appreciate..

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Can someone add an alert to this indicator when it switches fibo directions.It may be useful for us if an alert can be added.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I've looked at all of Kevinator's pics and he doesn't put in a buffer and very often will enter before the RF bar closes.  Although one thing, I can understand adding the spread to a buy if you are going to add a buffer, but not a sell as that would go in at the right place, as it goes in on the bid price, a buy goes in at the ask.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Every trade in this thread has been taken this week since sunday.I do not count how many trades I make I just relentlessly hunt down trade setups and execute.

I believe in productivity and action.Talk is cheap as I have heard it all.From this or that trader about their system and what it can do.I never see them actually trade it though.

I will say that my goal,our goal is 200+ pips everyday consolidation, trending, rain, sleet, or snow.Trading is done in six hour blocks or sessions.During peak hours looking for 20 to 40 pips a hour.

How much do you usually risk per trade, kevinator?

Well I got the 200+ today.  But, big but I also got 250- pips.  I think I have identified the problem, as I did some trades same as Kevinator mas o menos, but I waited for the frickin alarm and was 4-8 pips behind.  (see chart below)

Okay alarm off and scanning

I think I did more trades in last two days then last two months, my broker will  love me, tons of spread for them.  I feel like I am working though instead of just sitting here waiting  waiting, Im in the game ..ante up and deal

Thanks again Kevin . this is a blast and I like your gung- ho attitude

Hi Kevin..

Was just looking through your trades on the last page. I must say that some nice trading. You're a bit more aggressive than I would be with my entries but it seems to work for you.

Keep on posting your charts so we all can learn form you.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Take a look at this 5 M GU chart. See how the stoch has been under 20 and relatively flat for hours. Notice price, we have been in a narrow range. When you see this combination it's a NO TRADE ZONE. Also note the TMA bands are getting closer together. This just means when we break out of the consolidation phase we should get a good move. Word of caution, there are times when the first move out of these zones is a false move. These happen alot just before or right at the London open. I am not saying this is always the fact but be aware of it. This is why I use PA to help me read the move. To go higher I need to see higher highs and higher lows, to go lower I need to see lower highs and lower lows.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hope you will release the EA for beta testing today.

Thanks

Was able to score 10 pips on this trade.  Nice system Kevin.

Dan

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Here is an advanced technique. I would suggest if you are a newbie to learn the basic trading entry before attempting this trade. For those people who understand divergence here is an advanced trade entry that will just give you more confidence and confirm your entry.

On the 5M chart add the MTF Stoch and set it to 5 minutes so it reflects the candle formation on the 5 M chart. Now take a look at my picture. We have a long up trend and price starts to weaken and and lose momentum. When you see this start to look at the 5M stoch. As you can see we have higher highs on price but lower highs on the 5M stoch. Once I see this I start to look for pullbacks that don't exceed the last high. Examine the chart closely and you'll see 3 entries. Entry 1 is the most aggressive. It's taken with a minor pullback to the top band and price does not go higher then the last high. Entry 2 is after we had a touch of the bottom band and a pullback to the top band. When price reaches the top band I start to look for PA and the entry short. After entry 2 price goes to the bottom band and again pulls back to the top band. I follow the same process each time. Observe price action when price gets to the top band. When I see a nice bearish candle we have entry #3 which is the most conservative. Price is making lower highs as we move down. Notice the retracement indicator on each of the pullbacks...what is it doing??? Notice the 60 min Stoch, see how it is stepping down as we take these trades.

This is a picture perfect counter trend trade that turns into a full reversal that goes for the entire day on the 5 M chart.

Hi boy2boy...

If you entered long at the red line then this would be an incorrect trade. Why enter long when the stoch is stepping down???

I would suggest you keep on reading the concept is not difficult but if you don't understand it you could lose some of your hard earned cash pronto.

Hi

First thanks to Kevinator for showing us this strategy.

I desided to try it out, this morning¨.

I only tested it on cable, because we can all see a great down trend.

I have marked 4 trades I hope is with the rules. (Please commend)

The first I did not took because I was sleeping, but the last 3 I took at red line.

I hope it will goes on like that, but I think problems come when trend is changing, then we can have some loosers, but it seem we can keep those lsmall.

I added a BigMO black white line. For me its to say what trend is

Ok hope to finally I found a strategy that can give those honest winners

I have made a tradingplan where I look for 40 pips dayli on average.

But I have not found a strategy that could give me that trading on lower timeframes. I dont like trade with too huge SL, so this strategy looks like it can help me.

ok

talk later

regards

Peter

I feel you would benefit by using the Color Stochastic that Kevinator provided in Post #204. This clearly shows whether you are looking for a step up (long trade) or a step down (sell trade).. Don’t forget to make the adjustments to the indicator as stated in the post.

Just because the next magenta color bar of the Retracement Finder is showing above the 00 line in the chart you posted does not mean you forget the stochastic is showing you a short trade.. Have a look to see what would have happened had you waited for the magenta color bar to be below the 00 line…………it would have been a winning trade.

You need to be patient and look at what the chart is telling you and check that you have obeyed the rules before trading.

Go back over the rules that Kevinator provided in the Word document and using the rules, go over the charts applying them If you do that, I’m sure you will get a better result.

I hope this helps.

Regards

Hi

Nice to see you also like the BigMo.

Keep up the good work.

Look how BigMo kept me out from going long in EU.

Reason for me was that there was not much room up to BigMo

Two bad trades.

The E/U stoch repainted (it was up at the moment of the order).

--- 帖子 #268 ---
The stoch is based on a 1hr chart so it will change colour until the hour is up, on your first chart where you should have been in was a sell when the stochs were showing down and price reached the upper band then signalled.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Tried again, failed again.

Both stoch & RF repainted @ E/U.

4 x -10, am I entering too soon?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
As I put in the post above your last one, until the hour closes the stoch will change colour and until the 5min candle closes it will change colour.  Until you get the hang of it, try taking trades when the stoch (closed stoch) is going one way and the price gets to the outer reaches of the bands (or as close as possible) and then take the trade in the direction of the stoch.  It takes practise and thats what demo is for.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi

not that I am an expert in this however

USDCAD, the price had already passed well below the mid-line therefore there wasnt going to much momentum in your trade

EURUSD, Stochs were stepping down, why enter long - the price was not below the TMA bands where a long could have been entered in anticipation??

For the repainting of the RF indi, there is an updated version that resolves this problem

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Thanks, I'll add the TMA to the original rules and use the closed stoch instead of the current stoch.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Yes. The same thing happened with Aus/Usd and Gpb/Usd. Is it any alternative to 1h Stochastic which is not repaint (or recalculate)?

Frida

--- 帖子 #274 ---
No, its not repainting, if its based on the hourly trend then how is it going to be fixed halfway through the current hour?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Take a look at this post of Kevinator, it explains the MOM trades which are the safest ones to take:

Kevinator does go with the current stoch IF there are other factors like for instance overbought/oversold conditions and you are expecting a pullback, his posts of trades are extremely good and well worth reading and studying properly but it does take time to get used to the different conditions you would and wouldn't enter.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Another profitable trad. Now at +65 pips

Thanks to Kelvin

Still riding the direction.

Hope to get to 100 pips

Getting close to my 100pips take profit

--- 帖子 #279 ---
[quote=wickedwin;4681361]Tried again, failed again.

Both stoch & RF repainted @ E/U.

...

I observed hat the stoch M60 repaints within an Hour.. Hence makes its signal valid only after a full 60 min. Maybe if it makes use of Open Price,we can get a One-Time signal. I had two looser just because of the repaint. Or maybe I'm getting something wrong. But overall, I like this system..looks promising

[quote=starlimit03;4681594]
If you post the charts of the losses perhaps someone might be able to help or comment.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I'm asking for any suggestion what I (we) can use instead of 1h Stoch. I know that you can't fix it halfway  This is a chalange ( or problem?) for me - what to use that is in place and don't move after 5' candle closed and show me (us) the same - trend up or down at that moment. NonLagMA 89 maybe?

I just want to be on the safe side as much as possible. Regarding to Starlimit he also want the same...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Here is the final result.

Ones again a big thank you to kelvinator for sharing the system

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Sorry I'm not much help I love the system as it is so my motto always is if it ain't broke, don't fix it   You can't just take into account a moving stoch, there are various other things to take into account as well, and taken as a whole its a great system.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
If you want to be in the "safest" trades take a look at the MOM trades link I posted they are excellent.  Its exactly what Kester posted #279 previous stoch trend down, price goes back up to the outer bands then comes back down and signals.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
This is a MOM trade.

Mtf stoch is stepping down or up (down in this case).

Notice within the TMA band price is going in the direction of the mtf stoch.

Price then pulls back to the top of TMA band (Pullback)...but...mtf stoch still says market stepping down.

After price hits the top of the TMA when market is stepping down the result is a release of market energy with enough MOMentum to take price through the bottom or top of opposite band in the direction of mtf stoch.

This is the best trade setup of the system.Although you will have to wait for this setup to occur and only happens a few times a day.This type of trade will yield the most profit of 20 to 150 pips.

In this type of trade you catch those huge news bars of 70pips,90pips when the energy is released.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
How are you able to enter trade on the Magenta Bar?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
There is a fixed version of the indicator in this thread.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
My friend..

if you try to fix the repaint of the 1hr stoach, you will not get the early entry, which is the corner stone of this system...

if you replace the 1hr stoach.. i will assure, you will end up with -200 a day instead of +200 a day..  1hr stoach filters a lot of premature signals.. just enough and if one tries to flirt with it and filter more,  than it means missing a lot of good early opportunities or entry in the later stage of the swing/run which would damage the hit ratio..

I recommend to go with whats been laid out already... get in for more valid trades relentlecly and manage your trade after trigger.. if it runs in your direction try to keep it and bank at first real threat against your position and quickly move on to the next trade.. it could be +10 +20 +25 maybe sometimes +40 + ... scan scan scan..

keep it simple..  you hear the alert sound.. check the chart.. than check the 1hr stoach... if its stepping in the direction of the signal.. bammmmmmm set the order and go for it.

I hope it helps.

ps) Kevin if i am out of line let me know brother..

Hard rules of the system with no variations on this trade.Mtf stoch stepping up with long rf bar.Enter trade and exit with about 12 pips.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
MOM trade setup as mtf stoch stepping down.Notice price started down then returned to top of TMA band then straight momentum to the bottom.45+on this one.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Overbought TMA with my slight variation so I took the trade.Mtf stoch stepping down and multiple entry points.40+ profit closed.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I held the trade looking for more profit.

Price pulled back then market energy release.

Who can spot the mom trade on this chart?

You got it ...mtf stoch was in short mode then price pulled back to top of TMA and release of energy yielding a bar to the bottom.

This is the same setup as a news trade.You will see price pull back then release.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Like this?

Kev can you also post some failed setups. You learn more from mistakes in my exp. Thanks for the thread btw.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I have been in and out this morning and missed so many trade setups but managed to grab a few.

Good work everyone,

We are evolving and everyone is going from slow speed to profit making at record speed.I want everyone to move forward and take control of the market.Don't let it control you with fear and indecision.

You will overcome fear and indecision with confidence which will only come with experience.You will say to yourself I have seen this trade setup and already know the outcome.The only way you will know the outcome is if you are present for each and every trade setup that the market will give us.

Stay sharp and keep scanning.Navigate the terrain and make the maximum profit for the time you spend at the computer.Production, production, production........

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Kevinator just to be clear it seems your entering as the magenta Retracement Bar is been formed, not on its completion at the start of the next M5 candle?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
No I cannot......this is a positive work environment and failure does not live hear just minor errors which will be corrected on the next setup.

Words like "I cant and it wont" do not live hear.

Words like "succeed" and "you can" and "you won again live here".

Enter on 1st rf bar and forget the alert.You are the alert. If trade goes against you exit at 0 and look for another setup.There are so many setups during peak hours you have no choice but to be successful.

Like tennis you don't have to win every match to win the set.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thats right....

I am glad you cleared that up.I do not trade on the close of the bar.That is a lated entry.I dont use the alert either.If you want to be successful you must take this stuff seriously and scan the market and begin to anticipate trades.

At the most you will get all the profit you want in a day.At the least a lot of real world trading experience.You will learn to really get engaged and trade on another level.

As far as I am concerned everyone tradiing on this thread will eventually be in the top 5% that will survive year after year.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Not every trade is going to win but as long as the positive outweigh the negative thats all you need to worry about.  Like Kevinator has said though, don't sit and pick and choose trades too much, if 3 currencies signal at the same time go in on all of them if possible, because you can bet your life if you only go in on one that will be the one that goes nowhere and the other 2 storm into profit.

My GU trade from the AM session.

153 pips from GU from today

6 pips on EJ

159 total for the day.

good stuff kevinator!

I think I will try to add EU next week and see if I can manage GU and EU together. Then add pairs over time as I get comfortable managing the charts.  5 minute charts not that fast, but making me realize how slow I am.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
We are going from reading at a regular speed to speed reading a thousand page book in two hours.

This is a exercise in processing chart information.If you continue you will learn to speed read in a relatively short amount of time.This means more charts scanned and more trade opportunities presented and more pips made.

I think he used the TMA bounce after confirmation from the Stochastic Step.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
ok first red line is my first entry for +103 pips

second and third red lines are very low probabilty during diluted time zone friday afternoon, just to see lost both for -9 and -10 no big deal was also against the stoch its fine.

4th line short against stoch with RF currently +14.

Just doing some stress testing of this system really like it so far! thanks Kevinator.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
All 4th and last short GBPUSD trade now at break even, still fluctuating between +10 and +20. I consider BE a win so past 24 hours 2 winners 2 losers.

What will kill you in any system is if the market chops around for a whole week and finally developes a trend say thursday or Friday your account will get devastated by taking the signals prior to a trend developing like we are seeing now.

The drawdown will come when the market starts chopping again so keep the losses small and let winners develope as far as possible. you never know when the market will go back into hibernation. I have noticed when the market doesnt move there is usually an economic event big banks are waiting on then movement will start this isnt all the time but something to watch. try to limit the number of losers with any system. 10 to 20 losers in a row is very possible and what has killed me so many times after making great gains like today.

Just some thoughts.

Thanks all.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks Rebel!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I would agree with you if this was a trend following system, but its not.  If it was I would have just put sells in on GU today but I haven't.  Going by the different rules I have put in, in order, Sell, Buy,  Buy, Sell, Buy.  All with 15 pip stop loss and going for at least 1:1 on each but actually made a lot more than that.  Thats on a live account (I don't stay on demo long) 2 of which I took 50 pips each on but could have got more, no breakevens and no losses.  I also trade EU AU and EJ.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
ok then can this be used for trend trading and counter trend?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thats what I've been doing all day on all the currencies, obviously I haven't gone for so many pips counter trend but I've had 1:1 at least on all of them.  I don't like moving to breakeven anymore as I find it mucks up the money management, I either win or lose I prefer that.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thanks that what i though as well, +15 still short taking it into the close for sunday for sunday open.

Hi,

Been following this thread for a couple of days. Must thank kevinator for this simple effective system. Can a candle clock be added to show when the close of hour will happen. Anyone has a good indicator to point this. The colour stocastic which shows the steps in colour is a good indicator it would be great if it had an alert when there is change in direction. Keep it going.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
@kevinator

maybe it is better to put my modified version at page 1 to avoid confusion with the new readers?

some here said to trade both EU and GU. you know that this pairs move the most time in the same direction because of correlation. so ask youself. why to double your risk?

why not trade only EU. the same goes for USDCHF and the other correlated pairs. i advice for newbies to concentrade only on one pair EURUSD.

regards

Mediator

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Mediator..

my dear friend i got a request...   see if it possible..

on the Retrace Finder indi you were kind enough to add the alert... now.. can you set this in a way to only alarm when the RF bar is inline with the 1hr stoach steps?...  I know it asking a lot and not sure if its doable.. but if its possible it will be great as it will make a automatic filtering and not sound alarm on any RF bar.. less noise when we do constant scanning.

Thank for your effort already.

Dean

--- 帖子 #318 ---
not easier than this.

Set UseStochFilter to true and only alarm will ring if RF is inline with stoch, but..

If you set StochShift to 0(zero) it compares the actuall Stochvalue with the last closed stochvalue

if you set StochShift to 1 it compares the last closed Stochvalue with the Stochvalue one hour before (hope you understand)

cheers

Mediator

--- 帖子 #319 ---
you are beautiful my friend.. thanks a lot on the speedy work.

I do understand what you mean.. we will test it on monday.. forward test is always necessary for these things.

Updated version of retracement finder is one the first post for clarity.This version will display a magneta bar on the current bar (0) when signal is given.

Hi Fratelli, What is BigMo and Entry Timing indicators?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
no problem, exactly how does this fit in with the grand scheme of things?

I am assuming you have some ideas/methodologies for how this indicate interacts with the other indicators currently being used.

Can't wait to see how to begin to use this in your trading method.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
i liked thanks for your share , amazing system

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi

The BigMo is a moving average EMA89

I use a MA in color, so if price is above BigMo is black I prefer long signal and vs for short.

The entry indicator is a indicator I look at for help me timing my entrys.

If I say look for a short trade and RF give signal Stoch look right I then look at entry timing if it is yellow or Red and coming from top going down I take the trade.

If I get a long signal and BigMo is still bearish(white) I take the long trade if I have around 20-30 pips to BigMo. Because many times you will se price hit the BigMo and stall reverse or smash threw. But atleast it give me a signal to have finger on bail button if I am in a trade

And entry timing also help me to see if I have divergense.

I attach a chart, hope it helps you

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Kevin,

if you don't mind me asking how will the fibo indi fit in the current system?

Thanks..

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hello P.Dean

I am working on making it more efficient but will not post an idea until it can be proven.I am into solutions and not what if's or it almost did scenario's.I will have to build it and test it with real results before it is released.

I do not like let downs and neither does anyone else.So I will make sure it is efficient and works.I do not want to waste yours or my time with unproven work.

You did great last week and are really coming along.This week should be same as last regarding market movement.A little sluggish due to a lack of market liquidity.First month of summer all the hedge fund traders and bank execs are all on vacation so the market slows.

Should be back on track next month but we will still make a profits either way.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks for the quick reply.. I greatly appreciate how your approach things it's admirable, and can't thank you enough for your hard work.

Thanks for your notice of my performance.. I will be full speed in coming up week and will put up big numbers.. this past friday I had final of tennis tourney to play otherwise if i was screening i honestly would have got over 300 pips.. I left with +100 in the bag and i was bummed at end of the day when i returned home..  thats what the real potential of this system is folks and I only trade the 5 major pairs.

anyways, thanks so much to you and rest of the guys who are contributing...

bring on Monday i am ready to go and hope everyone else are as well.

Cheers,

what is the fib indicator supposed to do?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hello Everyone,

This system is great. Thanks Kevin for sharing it with us and thanks Mediator for your work as well.

Is anyone here using a Trade Manager for taking care of the trade after entry? I thought it might not be a bad idea- you can be in a couple of different trades at one time and still be scanning looking for another entry while the manager is taking care of the trade.

If anyone is using one, what settings are you using? I currently use one and have been working on getting the best settings.

Thanks,

Dan

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Fratelli, could you pls post your entry timing indicator, looks good for divergence. Many thanks.

Pardy

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Kevinator apart from the above settings the MAmethod setting is 1 and Price field setting is 0. It mirrors the indicator MTF_Stoch_4TFx4_CJA.

Here you go.

Hope it helps you

Peter

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I copied Kevinators settings from his charts and they are set to MAmethod 3 and price field 1, comparing the 2 I much prefer these settings so I am leaving them like that.  I haven't seen much difference between the 2 much but on Friday from 7am (UK time) the first settings were showing GU stepping up and the second settings were showing it stepping down, personally I prefer the second settings.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Peter,

Can you please post BigMo? I like how it kept you out of that trade..

Dan

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Kevinator,

I have an idea to offer you.

Can I get your email?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thank you kevinator and everyone else for sharing!

Is it possible to modify the retracement finder to alert us when two timeframes show a retracement on the same bar - or within a certain number of bars (say, two bars) - concurrently as shown in the pic below?

I believe it would be very beneficial.

Thanks again all!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Peter has said its an 89EMA so you could just put one onto your chart as a thick MA.  The other thing that should have kept you out of that trade was though the nearness of the top of the TMA band.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hello wonderful people,

For the first time in my life I have a strange feeling that this is a method that can change an ordinary man life (like me) if we work hard enough.

Now for the last 2 days I have been trying to get the mtf stoch the same way in mu mt4 as you guys have, but it displays like an ordinary macd type of crossinglines while you guys have the step up/down feature in it.

What on earth am I doing wrong?! I hope u can assist, and I promise not to ask you any of these questions again, but I am eager to try this now.

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanks Ohammond, that much I already figured out. I didnt take the trade, and wouldnt of taken it because of being so close to the TMA-way to risky. I was looking for the BigMo, my 89EMA doesnt change colors- I noticed his 89EMA had changed from white to black in that one area on the chart he posted..

Dan

--- 帖子 #344 ---
The cEMA_55 was part of the .RAR attachment from Dynel in Post #258.

It is set to 55EMA but allows the 3 colors and of course you can change the period.

regards

--- 帖子 #345 ---
If you use this one, that should do the trick, just change the colours. Set it to 89 and MA Method 1

EDIT: Sorry Duffy didn't see your post before I posted mine, either one will do the trick

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I understand Danimal was ventilating that he is interested in the BigMO that changes color. Nothing more about any trades taken.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thanks everyone for the help!!!

Dan

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Yes I understand, the only reason I mentioned it was because he said "I like how it kept you out of that trade.." so thought I would mention the TMA.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
True.

The TMA gives nice support to see what is going on and about what is going to happen ahead.

45 and MA method 2

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Lol either one

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I have noticed that there is alot of chat about different ways to change and or modify the system which is already proven and plainly laid out.

The problem with these theoretical changes is that they are unproven and untested.Markets change as the interest rates change and there is a transfer of money from one currency to another based on the best rate of return

.What I have laid out has worked in yesterdays market,today's market and will work in tomorrows market.

I keep a open mind to new ideas but for the sake of not confusing those new traders that are just coming to the thread I will say this : All variations and changes will be sent to me via pm first before being posted on this thread.

Existing indicator modifications like adding alerts,email, and such are acceptable.

I will not allow this area to be cluttered with unproven theory to the point of confusion of those who are just joining us.

There is no reason I should have to explain the hard rules of the system this far into the program except because others are posting their own unproven variations of over the weekend ideas.

If you cannot follow this simple rule you can post your gripe and take your business across the street never to return.

If you want to modify on your own time then have at it.

Here we will follow what is already laid out and take our profits as they come and they will come.

Any questions or comments?

Bagged a couple of pips on the Swissy but jumped at price hitting the upper TMA line. I thought there may not be much in it since entry was at the middle band. The penny then dropped-look at the consolidation prior to price shooting north!

I Was able to get some more pips, my trade manager stopped me out. I dont always have the time to sit in front of the screen. With this trade, after entry, I went back to the family and had some fun..I was able to get 8 pips and 5 pips from an AU trade as well. Im up 23 pips now. Have to work some more on the TM settings because I could of squeezed a little more out of both trades. Now, dont get wrong here, when I have the time, I will be in front of the screen scannning & closing the trades myself. So, this system really kicks As_! I knew the correct entry, which is key, entered, and walked away! Thats what Im talking about!!! This was live, not demo.

Dan

Update:  Forgot to mention that I usually dont trade this session..

Totally agree with you Kevinator. Why want to fix something which isn't broken? It seemed that some people are still looking for that Holy Grail of a system which doesn't exist , anyway, except in the mind.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
this always happens a decent system gets posted and everyone starts tweaking it. use the original system.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
hello, kevinnator:

Thanks for sharing. It is a good system.

I am not always looking at the screen but I still get 25 pips from later entry of kiwi short.

Now close it and go to airport for a business trip.

In the weekend, I paid some time for the EA based on this trading system. It does not bring a good result by backtest due to the MTF stochastic repainting.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
When the stoch is above 20 or below 80 do you get a better result? I notice PA can sit there for some time.. Also, how about when PA is at the top of TMA or the bottom ? Thats the most secure trades...Forget about the MTF for a second and study the RTF & TMA, what happens then? Keep us posted, would really like to know the study...

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I'm not sure can anyone advise me on this trade now ? @ 1.43413

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I wouldn't have taken it because there was a signal when the price was nearer the bottom of the TMA, the one you are talking about was just over half way.  If I can't catch it on the first signal I would leave it for a better signal.

EDIT: I meant to say the time of day comes into it as well, European markets (only a few are open this morning) hadn't started yet so unlikely to have the volume to push to new highs.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Sorry, i cant see where or if you took a trade? I also cant the the TMA bands.

just out of curiosity, do you have a few THV indi's on there too. just my personal preference and im assuming kalvinator might agree, but too many indis create confusion.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Thank you for your view. I've taken the trade earlier as I'm seeing prices is getting Higer Low and middle of TMA is now becoming support.

i'm putting my stop loss @ 1.43300 and now targeting 1.44000. Now @ +15 Green pips, stop loss moved to breakeven

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Dear Kevin,

i need some help with your indicator, i've upload your template and use it for the past 2 weeks and found out when the retranchment happen the candle did not change to magenta instead the candle have 2 color half blue and half yellow.

need some help coz ur indicator is very useful.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I would not consider the Eur/Usd at the moment as it has been ranging all day.

How did you arrive at your decision to go long?

Your chart seems very "busy" with other indicators on it that are not used by this system. I wonder if this is confusing you.

I personally believe it would be easier for everyone if charts posted only contain the indicators of the system and if people wanting help with their decisions posted their comments about how they arrived at their decision to trade rather than just asking for a decision to be made for them.

There's a few bank holidays today to consider if nothing more than to allow for patience in your trades.

Again, you are on the 1min chart, we use the 5min for setups.

Duffy,

well do we have a system or not? If you need to use discretion to evaluate each and every entry I do not see the sense of the whole thing.

Please advise

That is not 1 min Chart. look carefully and then you notice. The thick line is Coral

--- 帖子 #382 ---
What I'm looking at is the bar times at the bottom of your chart, 06:33 and 07:13 I have only seen those bar times on a 1min chart, otherwise on the 5min its always :35 or :40 etc but I could be wrong, just never seen it.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
There is only 17 Candles from the beggining of the days, it is not possible for 1 min to have only 17 candles prior to my Long entry. Tricky, but Kevin method had improved my trding by 70%.

I will post detail later to share with everyone.

Meanwhile enjoy the pips fro GBP/USd and EUR/USD Long.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thats great that its improved your trading, but rather than confusing people with different charts and timeframes wouldn't it be better to ask Kevinator if he minds them being posted first. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post4684681

There have been loads of pips this morning and loads of signals off of the original system and yes I am long from the original system anyway.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
1. Kevin system is excellent guide fro entery. ( I'm a bit aggressive on entry)

2. Price couldn't break friday low

3. Higer Low

--- 帖子 #386 ---
First I want say sorry for showing some charts and indicator that is not with this strategy.

I tryed to delete them but cant do it.

I future I will only post chart according to the original Kevinator setup.

I hope you can forgive me for doing so.

Here is a setup I just finish taking with a 30 pip winner.

Kevinator sent you a private message.

[quote=kevinator;4676863]Look at the Tma.It is so overbought and the retracement indicator is getting lower and lower and lower.

After sometime using the system anticipation will come naturally.I want you to trade in higher gear than you are used to trading.[/quote]

That is Kevin's statement. Use the system ti the fullest and you will mex the pips.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
[quote=Miss FXCute;4685873]
Yes and that is understandable, but when you post in here you should post charts from the original system otherwise when you post a setup as you see it, someone else will then scan their chart looking for the same setup, they won't find it.  At least if you're going to comment on a setup state clearly thats it is not the 5min chart you're working on.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Helix99

Thanks for the question. It made me stop and think.

My comment was based on my individual circumstances. Knowing that there are trading opportunities galore for this system as it seems to be traded on major and minor currencies. My comment was based on how many open trades I could have based on my account balance allowing for margin requirements..............so I was "selecting" trading opportunities looking for bigger potential profits.

That was wrong. So what if a trade gives you 10 pips? It is all pip profit.

So now I've decided to look at it as though I'm standing at the bottom/top of the escalator and to step on and start moving when the opportunity (trade) is there.

I'm very much on "trainer wheels" with the system like a lot of people here.

Thanks again for making me think.

Need help anyone,

the candle below did not change to magenta color (in white circle). can anyone help me on this.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
This one works, but the colour doesn't matter, just take the first up or down bar in the group.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
So you're not entering on a magenta bar only?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hello @ll,

again nice strategy

One trade today: long +15pips

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I second this post.

if I may add...

folks.. what has been laid out will bring more pips than what it takes... if you allow yourself to be scared of the negative pips, then you can do yourself one more damage, and that is to try to change up the original lay out by adding filters, indi's etc.  I put it nutshell.. i hope it make sense to you.

The tough part of this system and maybe every other system is not the understanding of what is laid out but actually executing  it.. in our case here is to be there for every signal... like Kevin said.. be present for every opportunity.. as simple as that folks.. if anyone does just that, success is guaranteed, period.

Follow the simple thing that is laid out and you will get your avg 100-200 pips a day... you doubt? ok watch Kevin.. some of the other good traders here and maybe myself..  believe and build your confidence based on what you see LIVE... that's what this thread does and I loved and its  D reason i joined in.

just some simple words from your little brother..

(I hope you don't mind Kevin).

Dean

Now I am putting my game face on for this week... scan scan and scan some more baby... Let's do itttttttttttttt..

the "default" settings are 0 for tf1 and 60 for tf2.  Do you leave tf1 at 0 or is it 5?

Thx

--- 帖子 #398 ---
here we go first trade of the week for me... not bad so far..

I could have easily taken +10.. but i like the setup so i intend to look for more and perhaps the break of the recent HH and see what it does there..

but the correct move was to take the sure +10/+15.. and move on to the next signal..

--- 帖子 #399 ---
The magenta bar is always the first up or down bar in the group so even when it wasn't changing colour I just took the first.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
lol I hadn't noticed.  Thanks for that.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
hi guys this system is very good system,but just one qus abt the SL,should i cut loss when the MTF stoch change direction or based of MM.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Can I ask how many pips people tryto make per trade?  I'm guessing 10 - 15.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
my humble take on this regard is.. to go with your own MM.. but it's wise to give the PA the minimum breathing room like 10-15 pips space or couple candles below/up for original SL.

overall do whats right for you and your game plan.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Thanks P.Dean four humble advice ,will cosider your advice .

--- 帖子 #405 ---
First post here.. read through the thread over the weekend and seemed like a good system to test out.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
what do you guys think about this one?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
out for +22...

taking the money and moving on to the next..

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Personally, I took the down signal before it because it was outside the TMA bands, half way down is not as sure.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
long on e/j... looking good so far..

--- 帖子 #410 ---
stoploss and takeprofit are still need to be improved in the system.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Can I ask if yours stoch step also was stepping down (RED)

when this long setup occur.?

regards

Peter

--- 帖子 #412 ---
this was a perfect entry but I hesitated...

i know its on the upper TMA but... it was in line on both 1hr and 4hr frame and it was good to go in my book.. i just chickened out..

close the e/j trade for +11...

--- 帖子 #413 ---
nice trade fratelli...

i took this setup too, at time that i took it  it was stepping up and that's all it matters...

the way this indi works... during the first change of momentum from up to down or opposite it changes until the close of the hour for the final firm change..  so if you don't take it at direction show of that moment you will miss the early entry at the peak time... but to avoid this you may let go of the first hour of every change of momentum and  take the signals in the second hours... and it can easily be done automatic for you with the new version of alert RF indi that dear Mediator fixed over the weekend... just got to change the shift to 1 from zero..

but I personally for now am going with zero shift and whatever steps show that the time of signal..

i hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
just a humble observation..

you guys notice the e/j trade..  now its faced with deep pullback and into negative zone if small given profit was not preserved...

this is a perfect reason why with this system Kevin insist on taking the money and moving on to the next setup... there is plenty of opportunities and no need to go for home runs, unless its straight shoot up/down move so you may get a bigger chunk or have the luxury to trail big.

cheers,

ps) I am talking too much I know... I go in my shell my apologies in advance.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Thanks for your reply.

But it actaully dont help me.

I see you use a diff. MTF stoch than I use.

and if you look at that long signal I did not took because my stoch was red when signal come.

but can you show me the settings you use on your MTF stoch,

I have added it to my chart, but cant figure out how your settings.

Thanks in advance.

Would there be any reason that my "purple" bars appear several bars later, similar to repainting? Last evening all of a sudden a purple bar appeared changing a prior green bar to the purple color some 5 bars later, after the fact. During the rest of the evening, while asleep, there were no purple bars as when I looked at the chart this morning there were just yellow and blue bars for the entire time. I deleted the "retracement finder" indicator from the screen, then reinstalled it and numerous purple bars appeared. Anyone have any suggestions what I am doing incorrectly? Thank you. John, 66trader66.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Y´all

there might be a good signal long on the EU in 10 -15 minutes from now.

will take that one

By the way, i have to say that I have a lot of problems with the system, especially with the entry timing. It is also hard for me to build up confidence as you cannot backtest the thing.

Will keep lurking around.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
ok..

i have combined the two MTF that Kevin has offered.. one is the regular on in the first post and the color one later on that i asked off him and he was kind enough to posted in the thread some pages ago..

this is what i have done... i have only kept the 4hr (240) on the original one and put the color stoch one on top of this one.. the setting on both are 14,3,3 and tf 60 for the color.

but the point is.... on this particular trade.. at time that signal arrived the 1hr stoach was stepping up.. but when the hour closed it closed as step down..   that is why i say to ignore the close and anticipate trades specially when you see the previous steps are inline with current signal.

let me know if still not clear.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
thanks for your reply.

That clear things up for me.

And I am sure now, that what happen to me, was I simply missed the trade when it setup

I then looked at charts after 1 hour candles close and saw the step down.

But thanks for your help

Peter

--- 帖子 #420 ---
ok guys..

this is the two indies that i use which Kevin has offered and Mediator has add alert on them.. it works fine for me..

the RF indie.. was updated for alert sound and the shift for early entry could be at 0 or more secure or later entry at 1..

the stoach indie... time frame 60.. settings 14,3,3..

hope it helps,

oh I forgot.. over the weekend our valued contributer Mediator made thing easier for us when i asked of him to filter the alaram on RF indie... now it don't alert on every megnata bar.. it only alert sounds on the valid one....  but as i mentioned above if you set the SHIFT at 0 in calculates the immidiate momentum singals and if you se the SHIFT at 1 in goes based on the close of last hour...

i recommend to go with 0... that's what i do.

--- 帖子 #421 ---

--- 帖子 #427 ---
This system can be easily backtested correctly taking into account the repainting of the TMA indi and the "repaint" of the MTF stochs (which isnt really a repaint, the same thing will happen with all MTF indi's)

Simply use one of the many trading simulator EA's that are available, this will allow you to blast through a daily 5m chart in about 45mins and see the changes as they would occur in real time.

I personally use the LFH Trading simulator (which is available freely on this forum)

Simply looking at the charts of past times is not really backtesting anyway, the only way to truly backtest is to either forward test, or run the historical data forwards again (which is what most trading simulators do).

upper band or not...  concentrate on the PA..

if you look PA has swing'd up nicely then has pull backed to lower band and resumed the direction.. on the first magneta bar I have taken it with both 60 and 240 stoach inline...

now you wanna sit and worry about bands??? lol..

--- 帖子 #431 ---
fair

still, in your a/u trade, you bought near previous high...

buy low sell high... not the other way around..

i'm not criticizing, just giving my opinion.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
exit out of the A/U for -6 and E/U for -3.. total loss of -9..

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Exit excellent from my point of view.

For me it is very difficult to get out with small loss.

You are experienced trader right?

cheers helix99

--- 帖子 #434 ---
not a problem..

my friend as i have already mentioned.. if it get a signal anywhere, where 4hr and 1hr stepping in the same direction I'll take that trade.. i disregard the band..

I see breakout happens out of overbought for more overbought and oversell for more over sell.. just look at G/U's last signal..

anyways that's also my opinion.

happy piping to all.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Thats what I did last week and regret it now, all my losses were when I went against TMA.  Rethinking that mindset for this week, now several small winners this morning already.

Ive gone back to a clean Kevin Chart, none of my old indys that have been my comfort zone but lackluster in the past.  Such a boat load of indicator and a head scratcher as to direction. Thanks Kev for the wake-up call...

Good trades to all, lets scan

--- 帖子 #436 ---
dear helix,

I am a momentum trader with some years of market trading under my back... once its there I get in and once its not there anymore I get out.. i look for a take off after trigger, if it takes too long for PA to make up its mind and acts wishy-washy before it gets me into too much trouble i cut it's throat, move to the next setup and by god in this system there is plenty of opportunities.. so with a low avg loss it should be fine enough to dream as big as one wants.

cheers and happy piping to all

--- 帖子 #437 ---
So you went in on EU again?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
yep.. one has to know how to get out of such trades with no feelings attached what so ever, otherwise trouble arrives in a big way.

i don't regret what has been proven for me.. the winner out weights the losers.. but that just me and everyone got his own opinion.

that's right.. let's be present and scan baby..

Ok guys I am out of here for the day...

between the 5 major pairs that i keep track of and trade.. there was plenty of opportunities, even on days like this when europen banks were closed and not much data all day and overall range-ish day..

as active as i was ( 6trades for 4-2 = +39) but i was pitiful on being present for every valid opportunites.. there was about 12 signals and i was present for only half.. that's where it leaks for me and for anyone who wants to be successful in this system... if i was present for at least 80% of all signals (which is a necessary percentage IMHO) i would have got my +100 minimum goal.

name of the game.. scan scan and make present..

just some words of thought.

I thanks Kevin and all other contributors.. i be ready to sharp starting frankish open.

Been looking at this since the start

Only just started today small amount of cash funded from other systems

EU only

Start 8am uk time

very nice system keeps you with the trend

Paulus

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hello

Attached here and in the 1st post is a updated version of the system.

Retracement finder is a modified version of double woody CCI.I have added this indicator as a replacement although they are one in the same.

Auto trendline is the other addition to the system.This indicator will allow you to visually understand exactly were you stand within the trend.

When price begins to break the trend line that is a early warning that the current trend is over and price is changing directions like in the photo.

This should keep you out of trouble when looking to determine direction of trend.

This also adds another potential play to the system which is the buying and selling of the trendline break as well as the hard rules of the system.

this would have been a good E/U trade, but stoch was down on RF signal...

kevinator, would you have taken this trade? why?

thanks

--- 帖子 #454 ---
dan, when you opened this EJ trade, was the stoch green or red?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
kept it simple

For a long

Must have price in between lower band and middle band

has been a step up on MTF Stoch

Long on black trigger bar on RF

TP is the Top band

SL is 1pip below the lowest low behind the signal

Visa versa for shorts

Bands have changed slightly since trades were taken

--- 帖子 #456 ---
did you take all those trades? because I'm almost sure that in at least 3 of them, the stoch was pointing in the opposite direction when the RF signal was given...

Hi Kev,

GREAT system! have looked at your live trades and this is definately a winner.

you posted the MTF stoch indicator in the first post, I was wondering which settings (i.e. which timeframes to use in it) to use if scalping on the 5m chart? which of the higher timeframes should you set to true/false as per the stoch in your images?

All that matters is you are finding a way to turn the profits.I wish you success and consistency.

Tomorrow set you sights for 150.......start to gain confidence and take control of your trading future.Confidence will come with more trades under your belt.

You will begin to anticipate and know the answer to the question before it is asked.The question being when to enter,how much profit to take, and were to exit.

nice job Paul..

great to have a Trader like your caliber in this thread.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Those are MOM trades.

If you are just selling and buying at the top and bottom of the TMA that will work for a while as the market is ranging nicely.

When the market starts trending hard the highs will get higher and higher and higher without the retracement to the bottom tma.

Hindsight it is hard to describe this situation even with a screen shot.It is something you will have to experience.

So If you are to trade that way be ready to exit when the market is overbought or oversold on the tma but continues to make higher highs or lower lows.

Variations are fine but you must leave the bare bones of the system as it is no additional indicators added and find a way to work with what is laid out already.

If additional indicators are added and they do not pan out this will only lead to confusion.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Kevin,

I got a question if you don't mind..

in my chart i have marked a shade spot where it is a valid entry for the long a except it is not on lower band and its at the upper band pretty much like a breakout trade..   would you have given go on this and why either way?

the reason i have froze this it's because during the days trading there is always discussions about TMA band as to take buy trades at lower band and sell at upper band and so on... but what do we do when PA starts trending and keeps making strides without touching or even getting close to opposite band.. (similar to what you have mentioned already in your last post)

Thanks in advance..

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi Kevinator,

I like your new WoodCCI. One can anticipate price change by the divergences it produced but of course one have to look at other indicators and price action itself to confirm. But it does make one aware of what is going on.

Many thanks.

May.

eurusd long entry and long exit 2/4.

Hello

Yes I would have taken the long position.According to your indicators the 4hr and 60M mtf stoch are in agreement.

In this case I would let price action run its course and push higher highs.If you are trading in consolidation for some time then there is a breakout making higher highs it is our first instinct to try to pick a high for reversal.

You should follow the trend and react to what the market is actually doing at the moment.If you have the 4hr and 60 in agreement you will usually get a strong push to the top or bottom.

There will always be a pull back after a strong surge to the top.

I noticed that shortly after that there was a change in trend on the 60m chart.Then Price fell below the upper tma then returned.

This was a really good MOM trade which is the highest probability setup we have and can be traded with max lots.

After that 60m and 4hr returned to agreement and long trend resumed so keep pushing higher and higher.

Economics drives these events so do not think in terms of I am looking for a reversal when 60m and 4hr are in agreement.Follow the money trail as far as it will take you.

Always in the back of your mind keep the MOM trade formation fresh and learn it like you know how to get to your local grocery store and can spot the route day or night.

I am short Audusd 29+ and still going.I am short of time this week so I will do a few trades here and there.

Coming off the high of the trendline as Mtf stoch stepping down 29+ on hold looking for more.

Eurusd,gbpusd,and eurjpy moving with cad on the way.Usdchf sluggish but still tradable.

Alright lets go guys.....get em again after the pullback and do not give the profit back.Even if you have to exit no sweat because another setup right around the corner.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Sorry here is chart

Good everyone got in.Im out at 30 solid as market way oversold.See what happens after a pullback.Maybe a push lower but I will go were the market takes me.

hello mates!!

thanks kevinator for this thead

i have been trading like like this like 3 years now with great results.

what session do you usually trade kev? cos i trade uk and ny but that is really hard for me cos i like in america, i will start trading asia and ny, lets see what happen.

have a good one all!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Uk and us but sometimes eurjpy,audusd,or gbpjpy during asian.System yield best results during uk and us session though as there is plenty of momentum to drive the trades.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
thanks kev!!

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Long baby

long on these also

closed 2/3 and have runners on all

I seeing EUR or AUD probably will make a good setup right now, am i right?

If your seriously on a mission to get all the money you can in the least amount of time...

You will be trading a 12 hour shift from 12 a.m. est to 12 p.m. est.During those hours you will get the most value for your reward v.s time ratio.

You should have no problem coming out way ahead at the end of the week.There will be bigger moves and more opportunities.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Kind of overbought so we wait 20 to 40 minutes for the trades to reset.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Kevin, been taking a number of successful trades using your method, but I have a question for you that I do struggle with.

If RF signals a buy when Stochs are in a step down phase and price is at or under the channel and heading north, would you enter the trade and disregard the stoch?

The example below of the Ozzie over the last half hour causes me to ask such questions:

No..It is not as simple as just buying over sold tma and selling overbought tma.

If you scroll back in your charts a few days you will notice instances were there are huge drops that keep going and going for 100+ points.

You do not want to get caught in that spot because the market drops fast and without warning.

It is like the market is teasing you with those kind of situations and the first time you drop your disciplined approach the very next bar will drop double what it just gained.

Have you ever noticed a market creeping up slowly for hours, then in a matter of two bars it drops triple what it took four hours to build up to?

You do not want to get caught in that situation.If you follow the system you will have turned down those trades like the one in your screen shot but....will have gained the large bars that destroyed what took hours to build.

So stay sharp and do not fall for everything that they throw at you.

Take the bait and get burned.You see how if you had bought at the oversold tma market would have reversed on you?

Even though I was using TMA and RF and saw an opportunity to take a trade, I didn't take it as I have been successfully trading the hard rules for quite a number of trades eg. the swissy earlier as you can see below. Your response has made it quite clear to me that I was questioning being unnecessarily opportunistic when there are heaps of trades around the corner!

short on eur..  first trade of the day

--- 帖子 #494 ---
hi dean,

it was also my first trade both for today and with this system. closed for +15,5 at the touch of the lower band.  let's see what else the day will bring...

--- 帖子 #495 ---
good preserve brother...

I'm still in it looking for the retest of LL to see it breaks through.. sometimes i do that... but you did the right thing to run with the money..

--- 帖子 #496 ---
p.dean,

I think getting out was the correct decision. did you get stopped out?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
-13 on this one.. greed got me, spanked hard..

did anyone take the E/J long signal..  I missed..

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I was in the ej, eu, eg, &ec and pushed my SL up cause i was not gettting much momentum and was taken out about 1 minute before they all took off for about 20+.  Oh well, I ended up with a few pips in each.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
good that you got some out of it..

e/j was a perfect MOM trade straight shoot up for easy +40..

no problem... we get'em the next time..

back to scanning baby..

let's get the 100..  how about it guys???  let's do it........

--- 帖子 #500 ---
your absolutely right my friend... and you did it perfectly..

i normally hold when i got at least the 4hr steps in my favor.. this time it was just pure stupid risk and it happens..

that's why it all comes down to execution for a Trader.. it's not about what you know but about executing correctly all that you know.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi All,

This is my first trade. EUR USD - 33 pips Profit. Still trying to find more trade setups.

Have a wonderful trading day.

2nd eurusd trade for today. let's see if everything goes well...

update: out for -9 as the RF changed its direction...

--- 帖子 #503 ---
short on G/U.. let's see what happens...

update:  out for -12.... RF stoach you name it all changed direction..lol

--- 帖子 #504 ---
much or less from the same point of my 2nd trade, I entered into the 3rd one.

I wonder if you saw both the RF and stoch change its direction would you quit as I did or wait for the price to hit your stop loss?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hey P.Dean, how do u get both 4H+1H stoch to show on the same?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
short on e/u.. overbought signal on upper band entry..  let's see how this one goes..  currently in a small slump, working my way out of it, staying relentless..

--- 帖子 #507 ---
open one... and drag the second one in the same box..

--- 帖子 #508 ---
isen,

I normally let it breath/develop and risk getting stopped out.. but on rangy days it can kill you and I try to use some discretion which sometimes can burn you and other times save you if the whole day is dismal..

i got burned on the G/U trade..

that's the way it goes sometimes..

i must confess.. market is really fucking with me at moment.. lol... but it ain't the first time nor the last time... being present will make it happen at end of the day, week, month..

--- 帖子 #509 ---
im long USDCAD

--- 帖子 #510 ---
i took the money (+11) at the touch of lower band to stop the bleeding a bit..

looking for more... back to scanning..

--- 帖子 #511 ---
do you have the the mql file for the trendline indicator

thanks

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Just closed the first buy with -8 pips loss.

I have now sold

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Does anyone consider where the Stoch is when entering a trade? i mean if the stoch is above 80 and we get a buy signal on the RF & price is also high in the TMA bands.

I have closed my USDCAD because of this. loss -10 pips

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I lost my connection after entering into the 3rd trade. later on I saw that during that time, price had missed my initial TP of 25 pips with just 0.5 pip. I pulled my SL to BE and TP to +20 according to redrawn TMA and crossed my fingers. a couple of minutes ago, it hit my TP. I think I was lucky at this one.

3 trades, 2 wins = +26,5 pips for now...

--- 帖子 #515 ---
dear lehmann,

usd/cad is in the very tight bands about 10-15 pips more than any other major pair the last two days.. that is just not enough to make any maneuvers on.. in my opinion that's what it is the problem and i have stayed away from it till it show some kind of life or widen that band a bit.

but.. if you decide to trade such tight range... one must only get in at top and bottom of each bands to have a chance to make any kind of decent money.. meaning when for example you get a RF buy signal, pa preferably to be at the lower band and 1hr stoach to be stepping up.. for sell signal opposite.

I hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Much appreciated  P.D

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I got two more trades on eurusd. the first one was at news time. I forgot to check the hour before I got in. Sudden spike got my SL of -14 pips. 2 bars later another opportunity appeared, and I got +20 from it.

Up to now 5 trades, 3 wins = +32,5

With appropriate managing of trades it could easily be +53 pips from just eurusd, not mentioning the other pairs.

if not on demo, I would quit now as I just look for 30 pips a day. but as i'm paper trading, I will try to get as much as I can today.

good luck...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Thanks for the system kevinator,took +14 on this one and still scanning.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Dont really have much time to trade today and will be in and out all week.Everyone suddenly needs me for any and everything.So I will take trades between personal schedule.

Market looks choppy and consolidated.After the day we had yesterday this should be expected today and tomorrow.Wed night,thurs,and friday will be harmonious trending and beautiful waves.

The type of market we would wish for everyday.You just have to pick your spots on slow days like this were market is not giving much "obvious" moving but moving none the less.

ln between my in and out today I grabbed the usdcad trade for 40+.Trade closed now and looking for more before I have to leave again.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Couple of trade opportunities which trigger was near the wrong band...

would you have taken them??..

in my book they both were perfect MOM trades with super force behind them..

your thoughts and comments..

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Isengoz,

You made some good choice there, good job.

thanks for adding you trades to the chart, interesting what others see.

Rock...out

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Good job!!

Keep moving forward...get past this point.This is the worst environment they can throw at you.If you can manage this type of market you can manage anything.

Go get another one.....

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Kevin,

this trade is anticipation instinctive type from overbought TMA since it don't fall into the rules... 1hr stoach was not inline yet.. pair was in a major rangeish mood..

how do you pick them at the right time big guy.. lol.. fill us in..

--- 帖子 #524 ---
everything looks swishhhhhh on this one.. let's see if does the goods..

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I didn't take that one as the price made a new low and still in down move in my opinion. for this reason, I preferred to be more cautious on this one.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
hi, good system Kevin,thx for sharing!

P.Dean hi,can u post this tmpl please?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I hear you isen its a valid thought...

but here is mine..to me it was a bounce off the last 4hr LL.. so since the 4hr still stepping up and its inline with everything else such as 60 and tma and the bounce off on top of it.. I took go for it.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
its all in the first post of Kevin... I don't use anything differ..

--- 帖子 #529 ---
well, I guess I was wrong this time. the price went up to the upper line. well done p.dean...

--- 帖子 #530 ---
out for +22...

back to scanning baby... PD is back from dead.. lol

ps)

thanks isen.. and your were not wrong.. just different styles and opinions..

the important thing for all of us is to be as active as possible to be present for most if not all opportunities... I truly believe success lies in that sense than anything else...  I have missed at least 4 solid winners from other pairs with clear signals.. this should have looked ridiculously successful day for me and all of us, and its a rangy market cross the board..

--- 帖子 #531 ---
A perfect set up

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Ha Ha Way to go PD,

Me too back from the not quite dead !

--- 帖子 #533 ---
well done brother doc...

but this baby looks to have more life in it....

who cares we got our chunk and moving on to take down more...

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Just got back in....

Missed some good trades as the congestion is clearing up and the money trades are here now.All pairs trending with clear entry points according to the hard rules.

P.Dean

Those were some good MOM trade setups.Nice release of energy to the topside on those trades.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
thanks Kevin..

so now that everything is trending... pretty much we can say goodbye to TMA to pullback to other side of the band bcz in most cases it don't.. so what do we do? disregard and just go with the 1hr stepping and RF signal?..

a little words of wisdom my friend..

thanks in advance..

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Yeah no regrets...

but cheeze whiz--- this puppy went another 30+

Okay so a little regret...

--- 帖子 #537 ---
3 trades for me so far,all ive done is add CCI bars ind as I have found sometimes the 1st bar doesnt colour black...the CCI bars just give me back up

+24+14+30 = +68

Paulus

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Nice paulus,

show and tell?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
More than one way to make a buck...

Since the 1hr stoch was over bought says long and the TMA was way overbought.

I looked at the 240 stoch and noticed that it was flashing red as if it was ready to change major direction...if only for four hours so be it.

This was a MOM trade setup on the 4hr mtf stoch.I took the next RF short bar and got the MOMentum trade.Straight energy release to the bottom for quick 30

--- 帖子 #540 ---
sorry

Set to 8 to match RT ...and yes I was there for all 3 and yes the stoch was in the right direction ...lols

Hindsight trading is for another thread.

Here we post the actions we have taken in the now.

Next time show us as you are taking the trades and what you did to navigate the terrain and not what happened three hours ago.

If you got 68 in three trades show us the three trades one by one or in a block anything else is counterproductive.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
i took this on disregard of TMA..  sorry..

kevin... i only show this one to get your feedback.. is it ok to make such trades when its trending??

thanks.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I second this post..

Paulus,

it would be a great help to us to watch in action when for example on your last trade that you took +30, how you held your ground for more pips when it topped the upper band and bounced a bit and you did not preserve there.. because on your other trades i see you bank pretty quick on early bounce off's..  it comes down to execution and the more we see it live the better is for all of us, the one who displays it and the ones who display watch it.

with respect.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
No problem P.Dean

We are evolving as a group.......

1st) notice all of those Mom trades if you would have been using the 240 stoch. 240 stoch says market is stepping down. Price pulls to the top of the TMA band then release again and again.

Double your account every day like that.

2nd) If the 60 mtf stoch says buy or sell and you get the RF finder signal take the trade. Especially at this time of the day when the market is hot and there is enough momentum to carry the trade through.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
To kelvin and all the experienced contributor to this thread, how do i get the mtf stoch indi to setup/stepdown it alwayz show the snake-like type of normal stoch. Am trying to run the system on mt4 strategy tester or does it only work(stepup/down) in realtime. Btw kelvin thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I will try Im also trading live with 4 pairs on another 5min system which i try to post..thats 5 5min charts ..i do not trade through a forex broker but spread betters so thats another group of charts and I have to initially manage the stops and claculate my 5% risk on the other system..

I disagree..Im no fraud as my legend shows but your the owner of the thread and I thank you for the system..the trades are not hind sight but actual .. I post when i can I do not just live to post charts to FF.

Any a trade that has passed can be useful ..but here is my latest trade and yes the stoch was red when i took it

You are posting results without really posting results.

If you show how you traded not using the system that is the subject of the thread you are confusing those that are just joining us.

Not showing the trades live is like me telling you well I got 1000 pips yesterday and bought and sold here here and here.

This is no help to others and serves no purpose except to show us you got 68 pips.

We are trading the system with laid out indicators.

The showing of trades is a purely interactive exercise to build stamina and better decision making skills.It also builds morale and is rewarding for new traders to the system to set a goal and actually follow through.

If you cannot post trades in the now as they are happening or stay close to the main theme or topic of this thread I would say not to post until you can.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
but my actual trades are as per the system

Ok I will leave the thread thanks for the system..I cannot garuntee I can post at the time of the actual trade taking place

My 1st priority is to get filled set stop and be safe

In my experience I have seen good coders who cannot trade and good traders who cannot code.

Well until you can post some charts showing how you actually traded those setups in real time maybe you should not post at all.

This is a interactive exercise and all trades that are posted are of live events for learning and educational purposes.

Since you do not live to post charts on FF no one is begging you to be a part of this training exercise.You are welcome here and you can follow the rules or take your business across the street if you want.

There are to many new traders joining us and I will not allow this thread to be cluttered with a gloat with no legs behind it.You swearing to me you took the trade does nothing but waste time.Just post the trade live next time.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi Lorka85,

I'm testing your EA, and I'm must say that it has very good programming, so thank's for that.

But, if you can, it will great if you add a couple of options like:

1. To open a position only IF the price is under or touching Bottom TMA for long - and uper or touching Top TMA for short. And touching in middle line for Long and short according to the trend.

2. Trailing profit that will move the TP after X pips and break and stopLoss too.

This my conclusions after testings =]

--- 帖子 #554 ---
hey Kevin, is this the right entry?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Meanwhile as I am talking with him about what he said he did four hours ago.

Here is what is happening right now.

Mtf stoch 60 and 240 stepping up so I have taken the next RF buy bar and now up 20 + pips.

Missed other trade setups dealing with nonsense.

Concept is so simple this is a live trading thread so post live trades you made so we can all be aware and if we missed the trade we will be alert next time.

The more we run the plays the better we get.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hello Vince

Go to the first post and get the new template.From first glance it looks valid but no way to tell as I cannot see it you have the correct settings.

Also I do not see the TMA.

It looks like you have the original system with autotrendline added.

Get the new system and I will be able to better read what you have.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
the tma is there, is new system that much different?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Now I see it, you should use the color stochs for better clarity.Trade was good for 10+ pips.Keep in mind 240 stoch still long so it is just a pull back and market might make higher highs.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi sorry can I ask what you mean by posting trade we take live.

For me it would be very difficult to post here when I am in a trade.

I watch the charts to see reasons to bail.

So do you mean that after we finished a trade from start to end, we can show here and ask quistions about it.

or do you want us to post just after we entered a trade.?

sorry for my English.

Peter

Ok everyone I am done for the day..

live played 5 trades for 3-2 = +27 pips... not a sexy result, i know.. but if you were here all day (or you can flip the pages) you would have witnessed how I as a trader struggled and bounced back.. and that is sexy.

I made two serious stupid mistakes right out of the gate got myself in a hole for -25.. but stayed relentless as to be present for more opportunities and pulling winner under pressure.. i am not the type to talk about myself.. that's not the point of this post.. the point is that everyone can see what a trader actually does go through in day of trading..the emotions, mistakes, win , losses, efforts, giving up, not giving up,  etc.. and not to mention it creates this cohesiveness amongst all of us as a family..  and i think that's what will make this thread great and helpful for all kinds of traders.. and that's what i call sexy baby.. lol

I was pitiful today.. +100 was easy to get.. but as they say, there is a very thin line between wining and losing or just being avg.. and thats why they play the game.

I see you all tomorrow sharp in arena to post 100+...

Market continues to push higher off of the 240 mtf stoch.RF bar long so I entered and now up 20 more.

If you notice the market is making higher highs from the already overbought TMA.

This is the reason you do not just buy and sell the over bought or oversold TMA.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
You got it,man

No begin punishing the market

--- 帖子 #570 ---
1)You have read and understand the standing rules of the system.

2)You have scanned a valid trade setup according to those rules or a slight variation that may be useful to others.

3)Your trade decision has been a successful one and is now in positive territory.

4) You take a screen shot showing the maximum yield so that we as a group and or community can be aware that such trades exist and can potentially act upon them if presented in the future.

5) Post every trade that is valid and falls under step 1,2,3,and 4 without exception.

Because you have a attainable goal laid out in front of you and you have engaged yourself to follow through with the system and post your results.

In time you will find yourself evolving into a professional trader.You will have the support and assistance of me and the community behind you and will get results much fast than if trading alone.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Nice system...but utter bullshit about posting live trades..... if your money is in then you monitor the trade......cause it is MONEY... Posting live trades are an ego stoke for some folks and dangerous for newbies....because some will try to take those trade because a "good" trader is in.

Also what sought of lesson is being taught that newbie should focus on posting a live trade? The purpose is to learn, yet you are encouraging persons to split their attention.

I guess your thread your rules but please stop the holier than thou bullshit about gaining respect and evolving into a professional traders all the while encouraging bad and dangerous habits...

That my 2cents and final comment.....any yokel who what persons to post live trade is definitely cracked......

If you want proof of trades use the trade explorer....lets see if you really are being profitable

I hope someone will help me in setting up my charts.  Do I download all four files at the bottom of Post #1?  I started by trying to download the zipped file at the bottom.  Wasn't able to open #3 (template).  Even after changing the name, I get the message "The file exists with read only attributes.  Please use different file name."  Same for #6 (TM5.ex 4)

Is the CCI indicator being used?  Thanks for any help.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Not to speak for him, but I believe that Kevin meant to post demo live trades not real money trades, unless one is experienced and doesn't mind. (As a matter of fact Kevin himself is not posting his live money trades.)

If a new trader doesn't know that much then hopefully the lesson will not burn too badly. If you're new, don't go live untill you have traded demo first then only go live with very small lot size.

...Mary I personally would start with the first system - as it is quite compatible with the latter one - and try to install that template and indicators, then after a day or two with that I would install the latter system - that's just me. If you still can't install the first I'm sure we'll get you there with some help.

Regards to all including Paulus!

P.S. This last sell was/is sweet. Too bad not trading my live acc. at the moment.

Hi Guys,

Have just read through the whole thread and just picked out trades that I would have taken today on EUR/USD from what I understand of the system.

Can someone look at the chart I have posted to see if I am doing this right? I know some of you may of stopped in longer on some of these trades but a profit is a profit at the end of the day.!

If the trades are correct it would of made +118 pips today on 1 pair.

Thanks in advance........

last time i checked i was the author of this thread and will not be told by some smart aleck how to run my business.

If you do not like it you and you opinion can get on your horse and ride the heck out of here and go back to were you came from.

Live trades will be posted here on this thread.we deal with reality and trading as it is happening not that hindsight lets discuss yesterdays trade.

You sound idiotic and i will not even respond with a explaination to any of your comments as i do not think you can comprehend it properly.

Now that you have stated your concerns you can take your business across the street as your counterproductive attitude is not needed or welcome here.

We are interested in solutions and if you want to be part of the problem i will deal with you personally.

Your thread and generosity for sharing your ideas is really great, but please allow some pluralism here as well

MOM trade for 30+ pips.240 mtf stoch stepping down as price hit upper TMA band for energy release to the bottom.

Classic MOM trade setup.

Keep moving and looking for more.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Mtf stoch 60 and 240 matching up.Entered short at the next RF short bar and now approaching 20 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Nice sell. Still moving down.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Moving on....

Listen to me,,

I plainly laid out the rules of the system and how it is to be traded.

He came on this thread twice to boast about how he made 20 pips here and 30 there.

He showed a chart were he entered the trade with no live entry points just his drawing.

I told him that this is a live trading environment and we deal with what is now and not past.

Because of his posts and ego he could not understand that and did what he wanted so now he is gone.

I will not have this thread being cluttered with rant about what you did with no proof to back it up.

If you cannot follow the simple rules you may need to tack your business across the street.This is not the place to throw your weight around with no evidence to back it up.

You say well he is well known.I say that until you can put up some trades live and show what you are doing everything else is hearsay and will be treated as such 1 post or 10,000 I do not care.

Ok so I went long based on the 4hr stoch, previous support and the way it had bounced off of 1.44444. Guess I am buying into a 1hr downtrend but would be nice if I got the bottom

I will not allow the general theme or hard rules of the system to be corrupted by anyone.

There are two here...Old traders who if they had all the knowledge they claimed the had would be on a yacht somewhere with FF as the last thing on their mind......and new traders or traders who have a dying account looking for some relief.

Were is Paulus's solution?

Were are the skeptics trading solution?

Were can I learn how to trade the market successfully ( and I do not mean a explaination of what I should do) I mean a real world example?

No were here....just a lot of hearsay and chatter.

If it weren't this thread would not be so popular.

Traders want the prize........they want to learn how to make money........I am going to show them how to do it.

You are either with us or against us.

BTW..I will not be muscled here either by anyone....I am the muscle.

this is just bullshit

sadly realizing this is not going to be a long lasting learning experience here

you are not the "muscle" and never will be with this attitude

this thread turns into an ego trip thingy

My goodness just please leave it all behind... move forwards please! Anyway after entering previously it seems there are still a lot of sellers. I'll leave the trade on but witnessing the bearish engulfing candle, I can't exactly say I have high hopes for this trade

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I won't be pushed or bow down and the sooner you realize that the better.

This system is my invention that I have spent many hours trading and fine tuning it This thread will not be compromised by any one.

If you want to learn how to trade like I do then you are welcome to stay.

If you do not like it then you are welcome to leave.

Hi Kevinator,

Do you have any same method/systems for non Meta-Trade MT platform user?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I am a leader...I am strong unbreakable to the market or any outside foreign force.

You can suggest and but make no mistake I trade this live and encourage others to do the same.

If that is to much for you to handle then maybe this is not the right place for you.

As far as me and the ones that want the prize?

Were going to keep on keeping on with business as usual.

If you want to try me?   Do it and see how it comes out for you.

You want to learn?       I got your back all day and night.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
OK Kevin, So that trade failed hehe. Was I simply buying into a sellers market? What should I have been looking out for there?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
No..these are custom indicators  for MT4 but can be coded for VT but will take the right person with the proper knowledge to do so.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
ET,

My broker is also a nonMT4 so what I do is to keep a demo account up with the same feed and have all my alerts, TL, charts stuff on that and trade off the other one.  It can be a real PIA but it works

--- 帖子 #597 ---
really good posts and system, keep going kevinator

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Sorry about that.....you know how I get when they start playing with me.

My  4hr stoch is red and has been red.

I noticed yours may have flashed green.You were on board a few pips but when it flashed back red you should have exited and moved on.

Take your regular trades off of the 60M stoch and take your MOM (pullback) trades off of the 240 stoch.

Do you know what a MOM trade is.If you do not it is ok and I will walk you through it.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
hmmm

pvt me and lest take this chat out of the forum I have not be littled  this system or you or any trader here,in fact I have complimented you on  the set up and execution.

If you bother to scroll though my many posts on this forum you will see  hundreds of live trades posted as they happen.Just because some one  posts a trade an hour old does not prove them a liar or a cheat we are  innocent are we not...we are not presumed guilty and have to prove our  innocence.I have no large ego I made a loss when I 1st started trading  for almost 5 years .. a forum like this turned it around for me and I  eventually became the moderator with a view to help all and put all  ideas in the pot.

You know nothing about me but seem intent of painting a rather bad picture of me which is totally un fair

I have read through the thread and have seen dozens of charts with  arrows going back 2-3 hours or more many posted by you why have they not  been publicly humiliated is it because perhaps you are insecure and  you want to be in total control..for me i dont care I have had threads  taken over and I say well done push on and improve for i cannot

This is a community not a dictatorship treat all with kindness and respect  I dont know you but would buy you a pint any day,..any one who crosses swords with the common enemy ie the market is a friend of mine.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend ..Im no threat to you..Im no threat to any one here

I am a simple sole you me and the rest of FF against the beast

I wanst going to post this I normally dont do this sort of thing as others have said the market is more important...but hey ho I just couldnt resist

P

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Thanks! I hope you don't mind let me know which broker do you use.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Exactly....use the demo as key and trade on the other platform.

Be sure that the price feed matches.If it is slightly slow then that is ok because when you get a good move it registers quickly in all platforms it is just the slow market that is a bit sluggish.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I didn't know properly no, but I do now! (must have missed a couple of previous posts from you) . So taking the momentum from the larger TF, we can see currently on EJ it has change to Short. So if price were to make its way up to the top of the TMA and the 4hr stoch remained short we could look for a short position somewhere around there?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I personally was holding on to the paper trade sell because both the 1h and 4h stochs were both down/red.

...Along with a couple of other indicators I can't post here confirming. But from what I see, those extra confirmations I have are not really even needed.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
And you was right too! Ahh well, we learn from out mistakes. My 4hr stoch did go green for a short time, maybe I got a bit excited and jumped the gun

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Understand this.

I have designed this trading system and started this thread.

Because I am on this thread for many hour doing live trades and teaching new traders how to trade this thread will go in the direction in which I have envisioned it and not the way that any newcomer to this thread should deem it to go.

You are correct to assume that I control this thread and if you do not like it you are free to take your business across the street.

I have been doing live trades here and have explained that this thread is to post live trades only.

I warned you to not post the hindsight charts as I see this as you showing off how many trades you made today which are still unproven.

You are so pompous that instead of saying ok and moving on you say to your self who am I to question you.

I am the thread author and the architect of the system.I am the guy the guides the direction of the thread and this direction will not be broken for you or anyone.

I would buy you a pint to but this is not about you and I that is were your ego kicks in with all the LOL

This is about the new traders who have not been able to find anything that works thus far.This is about those with dying accounts that no one gives a D about.

Thats what we are doing here and if you cannot respect me or those facts then you need to take your business across the street never to return.

Leave my thread and never return here........

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I am sorry I have to take time we could be spending trading and making some more dollars to deal with this situation.

Very simple......trade the system based on the hard rules or a slight variation.

Post screen shots when in profit and tell us how you did it.

The more setups we see the better we get.

It is like memorizing football plays.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Yes, many times one stoch will be red and the other will be green.

I like that we now have both stochs confirming.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
I am still holding my sell too....

I will tell you Dan what I am going to do.

If the 240 stoch stays red then price goes sideways to the top of the TMA then drops some more I will add another position at the top of the TMA.

So adding positions at higher lows all the way to the bottom.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I do too as the system is evolving and we are to.We must keep moving and stay focused.

All the other traders are done for the day but we are still operating.First in and the last to leave.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Could someone post a chart of their current EJ? just so I can see if mine is looking ok

*Preferably with the two different TF stochs

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Everyone, i want you to just ask yourself a question..

Do you find it more helpful when a trader who live plays each trade and shows the decision making in the now moment or the guy who shows hindsight trades and decision making of the past in the dark?.. think about it for a moment..

would you like to sit next to Soros or have him to just send his magnificent results to you at end of each month!!!.. which one helps you more?..

its as simple as that folks.. that's what this is about.

If the hindsight trader show incredible results.. wouldn't you want to know how he did it, so you can learn to be helpful to you somewhere down the line?

here you got a guy that shows incredible results one after another and its live.. wouldn't you prefer that over hindsight stuff?

These are some simple and very logical questions..

I am not pointing finger at anyone nor taking sides.. just pointing out some solid logic's that IMHO are valid refers to most traders who are trying to find their ways with this beast.

don't ruin this folks... be practical.. follow the rules and respect them.. cherish and protect a good thing... believe me when i tell you, that, you will be the one to lose out and not the founder of this thread.. Kevin and a few others in here who are sound traders will not be damaged they can go to their own shell and make tons of money... he is not asking for much...

respect the rules and follow through for your own good.. do it for yourself.

I hope I did not intrude or offended anyone... let's hope and pray for a long lasting community that has just begin in here.

let's move on and watch each others back to find success and continue success.. we all owe it to ourselves and the community that we live and operate on.

peace and good karma.

Hi again

Sorry for being a pain in ass.

But now I see a stoch H4 coming into system.

I fully understand what to do when signal match both timeframe.

But I am not sure how to do if 1Hour give lets say a long signal, but 4 H is still red.?

If the answer has been given in thread, I will say  sorry but then I overlooked it.

Peter

--- 帖子 #617 ---
hi trademan,

if you want to backtest the day I recommend you download TMA-true indicator and use it instead of the TMA as it repaints. when you look through TMA almost every signal will seem perfect, but with TMA-true, you'll realize that some signals don't work. you can find the indie from the paperclip at the top right of the page in the downloads section.

see you all tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Not quite sure if this is correct but hopefully Kevinator can clarify if I have been doing it wrong

the 1 hr stoch is for trades within the TMA bands (ie, bottom to top, top to bottom) in this case the 4hr is not needed the 1 hr is the important one

the 4 hr stoch is for the MOM trades mentioned, when price is outside the bands

of course my interpretation could be completely wrong but this is the way i have been trading it

--- 帖子 #619 ---
here is my chart for sake of helping.. I am not in the trade as i stopped trading hours ago.. just came back to check my emails before going to bed.

both 1hr (yellow lines) and 4hr (blue line) are inline and its a nice setup for mega bucks.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
No worry Peter

System is evolving...60M stoch is for regular short trades which can be confirmed with 240.

If you are taking the 60 and the 240 does not match then be aware that the overall trend(240) is not going in the direction of the 60 so get in and get out.

If 60 and 240 match you can expect a bigger move for more profit.

MOM or "slingshot" trades are taken from the 240 in the direction of the overall trend.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
To Trade-man

Use the regualar TMA and not the TMA true.

You want the one that adjusts itself like the center of gravity.

If you use TMA true you will get off track.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Thanks that make sence now

Peter

--- 帖子 #623 ---
hi kevin

nice system

stoch 240 settings is 14,3,3 or 10,3,3 ?

and how do you put 2 stochs in the same window?

thanks

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Stoch is 14.3.3

in MT4: u have to open "navigator" and then drag the indicator to the right and then drag the other one upon the window where u have the first

--- 帖子 #625 ---
HI Kevin

Sorry if the question sounds stupid but I'm not a indicator user, I like the sound of the system so would like to be clear about a few points I see you have an updated version where you use the woodies indicator I think that's what it's called, how is this different from the retracement finder and what advantage does it serve. Also the stochs I notice they turn green than flash back red now if a stoch was Red i.e. stepping down you have a RF bar in the same direction you take the trade now if it flashes back green do you exit the trade and if it turns Red again do you re-enter. Apologies if something similar has been asked before.

I don’t want to make any modifications to you system but I notice many times you enter at the RF bar i.e. not wait for the close I'm sure many would like to enter a trade as early as possible have you considered looking at volume to enter at the same time or even slightly before the RF bar.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #626 ---
done!

thanks

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Depends on the time of the day.Mtf stoch is a sensitive indicator and when there are instances of indecisiveness it will flash.You must pay attention were you are at on the TMA and make decisions according to that.

If you are ever unsure then do not take the trade as another setup is right around the corner.

I enter on the first rf bar and not after the close.That way I get a better price.

Slight modifications are welcomed and encouraged just do not replace what is already laid out because my system has been proven and is a foundation in which we can build upon.

We would be no were right now if we were just adding more and more indicators.

But we just are adjusting what we already have and using our creativity and we are coming up with some good solutions and safer entry points.

Updated version has woodies indicator which is same as rf finder.I thought I would add it for those that prefer cci.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi,

Can  anyone help me with how to make a clour change in the 1hr, 4 hr Stoch. I have green as my 4 hr step stoch and red for my 1 hr stoch. They don't change colour when they are stepping up or down.

Sorry I cannot post picture of my chart--- I do not know how ...Maybe someone could help me  that too.

Many thanks.

May

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi

As I see in Kevinator charts the 4H stoch is 10.3.3

regards

Peter

--- 帖子 #630 ---
You have to wait until they change color.That means the overall trend is one way and the short term trend is another.

During this hour trades will be slow.When the market speeds up eight hours from now you should have no problem..

Eurjpy  or aud gives the most movement during these hours.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Ok, so looking at EJ currently it seems to be heading for the outer TMA band. My previous 4hr stoch closed green but the current is red, so would I be looking for an entry off the outer TMA short?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #632 ---
This is the safest and most high probability trade of the system.

MOM=momentum or slingshot

You see the 240 stoch is green for a long trade.Price hit the bottom of the

TMA then explodes to the top with a release of energy.

This is a mom trade or slingshot trade.Price pulled back then went in the direction of the trend.

This works vice versa and on all pairs.

My last trade...see you at midnight est.

I spoted it a little late but still got in on the trade. 20+ but should have been 40.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Aww, my chart is different to yours  even with the stoch changed to 10,3,3 it is still red for short. Guess the different times of brokers could be an issues for each new 4hr candle.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
This is a picture of the same chart with examples of past MOM trades

240 stoch is one color then price hits opposite TMA band against the trend

then price will slingshot to the top or bottom.If you have the patience you

could sit and pick MOM trades all day and never lose again.

Look closely at the previous picture and this one.

If you understand what I am saying to you this is a one of those moments of

enlightenment were you finally understand things of how they are and can move on with your finances.

Well thats a rap...if you understand MOM trades you can go on and get fat and rich now.

Scroll back in your charts and look for past MOM trades and then start to look to the future for Them.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Mine is still red as well I'm on FXPro which has a difference to Kevinators of 2hours with the close of the candles, but you can only trade what you yourself see.

EDIT: So instead you should be in a MOM trade in the opposite direction to Kevinators

--- 帖子 #636 ---
short EJ

--- 帖子 #637 ---
If I could make a suggestion about the posting of live trades, there is no point really in taking a screenshot 10 bars after the buy or sell has taken place, because the stoch etc will be different to how they were at the time of placing the trade.  Yes of course there is the buy or sell line to prove you are in it but it doesn't help with what you saw at the time.

Why not hit the print screen button just when the trade has gone in, then when your trade is in profit paste that print screen into your favourite image programme instead of waiting till then to actually take the screenshot.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hard to do when scanning charts have to wait till things settle. The pairs that I watch move together more often than not so when theres a trade on one theres a good possibility theres one on another like EU at the sametime I just missed it trying to take a screen shot.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I totally agree with that, and that the reason I won't be doing screenshots either.  My point was though, for those that are doing it, I don't see that it helps 5, 6, 7 or more candles into the trade as it doesn't show what you were seeing at the time anyway.  The only thing it does is show your buy or sell line and how the stoch is at the time of the screenshot not when the trade was taken.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Well the Stoch won't change in 5 5m candles unless its on the hour when the 1 hour candle closes.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
EJ and GJ MOM trades(not sure but I suppose?),

4hr sto steps down and price touches upper tma line.

Thanks for sharing this great system by the way,

I respect your hard work and your willingness to teach others.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Aah yes it does, in the current hour it can change a lot.  The current stoch will change if it needs to until the hour closes, in some of the posts in here you will see people have posted "the stoch was up when I took the trade" or similar remarks.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I haven't noticed it enough then to see it move much.I trade alot of PA based trades and like Kevins stuff for extra conformation so some trades won't have stoch in the right place.

Not paying attention..

You missed the MOM trade on the 240 stoch.

240 stoch is in the red...that did not change.

Price hit the top of the TMA band.

Energy release to the bottom.

You cannot see the forest for the trees.

Using your system and I haven't found anything even close to comparing with this set up. Playing things safe taking solid pips in the safe areas and it has been turning my account around. I really appreciate it.

Three styles of trading here:

1st)Mom trades for more pips =240 stoch

2nd) quick 10,20 and out =60 stoch

3rd) Mid term trades 20 to 40 pips=60m and 240 stoch agreement

Important to start from the begining.We have covered how to get quick 10 quick 20.Now we are covering longer term trades.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Thanks Kev.............

--- 帖子 #665 ---
What do you guys think abt this set up ? is it bottom out ,from my point it looks like ready to change trend <IMO...pls advice

Thanks

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Look at the 240 stoch...it is red.So wait until price hits the upper band of the TMA.Then sell if.....240 stoch is still red.

So as of now price is trending down.Wait until price pulls back to the top of the TMA.At that time if the 240 stoch is still red then the down trend is still valid and price will continue down.

Your entry point is at the top of the TMA band.

So 240 stoch is red and wait for the pull back to the top of the tma and sell.

Use the RF to enter downward.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
hi Kev ,your advice is a eye opener for me thanks

--- 帖子 #668 ---

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Hi kev ,are you saying that the AJ is down trend based on purely MTF STCH 60m and 240m?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Thanks Kevin

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Now up on 240 and as long as it takes wait until price hits low tma band on aj then take the next long bar on rf finder.Price will shoot to the top and that is your safest entry.

While you are waiting patiently for the trade setup scan some more charts to see if they meet your criteria.

I am sleeping now see you in a few hours.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
I think you misunderstood what I was talking about in that post.  We were talking about the hourly  stoch changing colour, but I had already said in this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...60#post4691660 that we should be in a MOM trade on EJ for a sell after someone said his 4 hourly didn't look like yours.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Oh,

I could not tell as all I saw was you posting your screen shot of the mtf stoch flashing as if to confirm something and the lol and I was and still am very curious as to what all that was about.

I pointed out that while you were concerned with trying to take the short term trade the long term trade was presented and missed as I did not see any entry on your part.

Also I noticed you advising what type of screen shot to post and what not to post based on your opinion and I wondered who did you speak to about what is and what is not appropriate to be posted on this thread?

--- 帖子 #674 ---
New traders post the screen shots that you have and any questions you have I will be here to assist you personally.

I have no idea what some people are thinking posting their rules on this thread.

New traders and those with rebounding accounts this thread is for you and about you.

If all these so called experts continue to ridicule and insult you they will no longer be here and that is my word.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
You can read what we were talking about in the thread, no point in guessing when its in black and white.

No, if you read the top of that post it says it is a suggestion, not advice, as I said, not much point to showing screenprint of a trade you took a lot of candles after the fact, but you are obviously easily offended by most posts unless its telling you how wonderful you are, so I will be like Paulus and very many others who will leave the thread.  I don't need to stroke someones ego in FF as I trade profitably anyway so I'll leave that to the newbies.  Exceptionally good system just a shame your thread is going to turn into an ego boosting exercise.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
That is were you are wrong joe..

You do not get fact through your thick head that there are some traders here with there last bit of cash trying their damn hardest to rebound and they need encouragement and guidance in order to get their accounts back in order.

You only give a damn about yourself.

If traders thank me it is because I am trying to give them the keys to rebuilding their life or enhancing their already lifestyle.

And why not say thank you.......This is free not for sale.....You would sale this and never give it away....thats what type of person you are.

I on the other hand am about helping people and just like the other guy..]

I will tell you this .....you laugh at or kick a poor trader and your are gone!!!!...

See you later goodbye.......he made that mistake with that lol junk and so did you.

It is not your actions it is the attitude on you that I can smell through this computer screen because I have been around enough to know what I know when I see it.

240 stoch in the red as price hits top of TMA now energy release to the bottom.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Kevinator,

One question please: your arrow on EU showing sell at the top of TMA, but in your Retracement finder down bar comes after it ..... am I missing something or ..... ?

Could you please explaine.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
I took the trade early.

Correct method is to wait for the retracement finder to give you entry.

If you are trading the live account wait for the retracement finder.

I know what it is going to do but sometimes it gives higher highs so wait until you get the rf bar going down.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Few hours sleep I will check back in later.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
In this last short trade in EU, retracement bar came when price touched middle line of TMA .... this is already late to wait for the signal. Is that correct?

Hi everyone.. a bit of a late start for me here..

my first trade of the day on sort of a mom trade short on G/U.. lets see what happens.. looking for lower band crush baby..lol

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Aud usd bonus trade taken before the 240 turned green .

Light drawdown

alert************

Now that the 240 stoch has changed to buy if you buy and hold at the bottom of the tma band you will have picked the absolute lowest bottom of the 4 hr trend which will peak in a few hours

--- 帖子 #691 ---
We use the 1hr stoch for quick 10 quick 20 within the trend.

We use the 240 stoch for long MOM entries.

And that my friends is why I am in charge of this thread. What just happened!!??

--- 帖子 #692 ---
ok...

so when 4h and 1h are in conflict you take 4h ?

that develop as a good one...but it could easily get worse...of course if God loves you and with a good pray you can enter any trade

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi Kevinator

How much do you rely on your auto trendline indie , in making these decisions to sell , when  it crosses them or not really much at all??

I know this was an obvious example of sell but I am talking of more complicated trades ie ranging or consolidation

Thanks

Great system thanks

--- 帖子 #694 ---
nice start right of the gate...

ps) update... my sl at breakeven... and letting this baby ride for now since now the 1hr stoch is inline as well.... its a RFT one baby (risk free trade)..

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Jesus loves us all my friend..it is already done.He deserves the thanks so everyone all at one time T.h.a.n.k you jesus.

Hi

What a wake up call for me.

I missed all the MOM trades, while reading and thinking, but

now I understand what you saying.

So next is to catch them myself.

But this was a great excersice for me, when you put in this charts

Great work

thanks

I will be ready next time

hi all,

the entry point of my first trade on e/u is the same as kevin (#681). so I didn't send any charts. a couple of minutes ago, I closed it for +30 pips. a good beginning for the day.

good luck

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Yeah good run dean....

You get it now.You have to wait until the setups present themselves.

MOM trades on the 240 are our daily pips.Thats how we grow our account.

Then once we are full we make extra money scalping the 60M setups like we learned last week.

This week let us concentrate on the 240 chart only.

We concentrated on the 60 last week.

Next week we do the 60/240 then we are done.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
In a hour or so if price returns to the top of the band and the 240 is still red sell it again and again and again.

If the 240 turns green then wait until the price hits the bottom of tma and buy.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Thanks kevin, will do.

great job isen.. nice bank..

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi Kevin,

Job well done I must say : Congrats !!!

Yor documents is well written and easy to follow but for some, they just find fun to argue ( part of their daily rituals).

I appreciate what you've done here. Thanks a million pips.

Miss Cute

--- 帖子 #702 ---
ok boss, very well understood

and thx p.dean, you did well too...

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Hi cute..

now we got a lady fan here too, nothing can go wrong no more.. sky is the limit folks..

welcome aboard miss.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
YW,

I know were about the business around here.

We missed the usdcad trade.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
That was like 100+ pips in one run.Us session hasn't even opened yet.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
folks... at moment if you pay attention you notice that your alert don't sound much... that silent sound is the sound of market trending or at least penetrating through the bands in one direction..

for that reason we (Kevin) have the MOM setups to take advantage of the market runs..  you get in and ride it till you reach your bigger targets as Kevin has mentioned.. the bread and butter..

we got the short term trades... and this is the long term trade when setups are less but superbly profitable.

it's like the boxer... jab jab jab (short term trades +10/+20's).. then the knock out punch with big MOM for 50+'s..

just some words from your little brother.

( Kevin, if i go wrong at anytime let me know)

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hi Kevinator!thank you for exellent thread.Where you put SL?

Alrighty you guys have fun...Im going to get some sleep and I will see you in a few hours.

Ok last trade I had to get em again then I'm going to sleep I promise.

240 stoch green and tma oversold at the bottom so I bought.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I do not know how much money you are trading with so I will tell you what.

You manage your own money and I will concentrate on putting you on better trade setups.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
240 and 60 in line still.. London just opened... I hope and look to see a test of recent LL... if it's strong break I will surely keep it for more.. if not and its wishy washy I may bank the +40 but staying with the trade till the 240 and  60 are inlined...

remember that i got nothing to lose but the money on the table on this trade.. but you got give some to get some at some point.. but as long as its with the house money..

Challenge of the day...

How many of these trades can you hunt down enter and exit for profit iin one day?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Although you got a flash the trade is not done yet.You getting drawn down.Let see how it ends.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
No, no I mean I'm done, stopped out after the pic was posted...

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Thats what I mean,,Maybe your stop was to close and the trade will continue down.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
i think Kevin missed that you sold the trade.. he is hunting the long..  I could be wrong kev.. lol

but if I may Pedross.. this was a bit of a dangrous sell as you took it on a smallest flash of 1hr red..  it's valid but one must be superbly alert for the quick turn around on this type of setups.. look for quick break or get out of it as soon as you can..

i also recommend to maybe on such early entries that could be premature.. to wait for the RF candle bar to fully close and enter on the next candle..

it's just a suggestion..   your comments Kevin.

ps) by the way i got stopped at breakeven on the G/u trade... i took the risk to catch a bigger profit or perhaps a runner.. No sweet..  scanning, next..

--- 帖子 #721 ---
I still think you should have held the trade a bit longer as usd chf is notorious for slow movement.

My Audusd trade flashed green then drawdown a bit to red but I held and this is the result.

You all know the rules of the 240 trades.

It will take a few days for you to gain confidence then your off to get fat and rich.

Im finally going to sleep and will see you in a couple of hours.

Don't let up on them and get the money when the opportunity is presented.

Good day.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Here is a excercise for everyone.

Scroll back in your charts and pick out MOM trades.Look at the different examples and anticipate those examples in the future.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi Kevinator

a pa penetration and cross through the lower band.. new LL .. then pullback to upper band.. 240/60 in line.. now RF has alerted... and as you see i got my short pending order in place..

a visual before the trigger...   hope it helps..

--- 帖子 #725 ---
GJ MOM Trade. short

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I froze this picture just for education purposes.. and Kevin you can correct me anytime if i am out of line..

on E/G at moment our 60stoach and RF telling us to go long... ok and its totally fine... but be aware when you take these types of trades that the:

240 stoch and 60 min are majorly stepping down .. trend is bearish.. so this reversal could be premature or lasts only for small winners.. and it may very well turn around on you very quick.. so don't give away too much and stay fully alerts on this until you are out of the woods.. that 60 stoch could be just a small flash and turns back to red.. so don't fall for it too much and keep PA in back of your mind as to what's really happening.. don't let it to make you fall into second guessing but just be aware on such setups...

I hope you find it helpful since i think i see some people struggling with this in their mind at the early stages of this family.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
sorry the dummy forgot the actual pic again..lol

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Update: Closed this trade with -10 pips as i got a RF signal the other way and 4H stoch turned green. i will wait for another opp.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Should have held that gj trade.

You have to get a feel for the trades which will come with more experience.Stop loss to tight on this one.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
i took the e/j early like Kevin does because it just looked so damn hotttttt..

I think its the anticipation that he talks about building up..

--- 帖子 #731 ---
We had a major news event just occur, do you trade through news times?

Question:

I have never seen anything on here (if I missed sorry) about S/R or anything like that.  I was wondering if you can see clear S/R just ahead of a trade and you get the signal do you take it or wait for the next one?

thanks in advance

Thanks PD, in hindsight you were quite right, it was a risky trade as per early red 240 stoch change. I won't make the same mistake again!

Took the EURCHF (240 and 60 red) shortly after you did and bailed at the lower TMA band, although it may continue to continue south...

ps. incidently we share the same MT4 GMT which is handy for coordinating the 240 stoch

The Divine ( Post 651 )

I don't know if you have cured your problem with your MT4 but I had a similar problem a few months ago where my MT4 of long standing kept freezing my computer.

After much trial and error I realised that it was an update to my anti-virus (or maybe it was my firewall) that caused the problem, so I removed my MT4, closed my firewall and anti-virus whilst I re-loaded my MT4. Once loaded I re-opened my antivius and firewall.

I haven't had a problem since.

Hi P Dean,

Could you help me ?? I have followed this thread for the last 3 days reading that is. my MTF stoch , is not like you guys mtf stoch ..... mine is like a worm,going from red to yellow and then to green....weird !! how do I get it to the step up for buy and the step down for the sell?? that all you guys have ??? I know this is a simpleton type question ,and believe me I don't like asking like this ,but I am at the end of my tether,buggering about with this.... without telling me I am a silly old sod could you explain why I cannot get the steps instead of the worm ?  please dont ask for a picture ( I cant do that either ) but I keep trying..... lotv.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
no worries brother i got your back.. we're all here to help each other out..

I have attached the color stoach.. load that to your meta.. than posted to your chart... after that.. set the time frame to 60 and the settings to 14,3,3.. you should see the steps right after..

Kperiod 14..

Dperiod 3

slow 3

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Make sure your Color Stoch indicator under "Inputs" has "Time Frame" set to 240 for the 4hr stoch. Set KPeriod to 10, DPeriod to 3, Slowing to 3. (For 4 Hr, follow PDean's settings for 1Hr)

Set your colors as follows: first row with the 255 numbers is the setting for "None".

Beat me to it PD!

--- 帖子 #742 ---
For those who has similar problem, here is the solution:

- close your MT4

- go to MT4 indicators folder (C:/MT4/experts/indicators/)

- delete all EX4 files which have MQ4 files

- DON'T DELETE EX4 files which not have MQ4 files

- start your MT4

For the example, you have 2 files :

- Color Stochastic v1[1].04.ex4

- Color Stochastic v1[1].04.mq4

Delete only  Color Stochastic v1[1].04.ex4

But if you have only EX4 without MQ4 file, DON'T DELETE it.

MT4 crashing problem usually because the EX4 files previously created by a newer version MT4 than your have right now.

Deleting all EX4 will force your MT4 to create a new EX4 (which has same version with your MT4) from MQ4 file.

Hope this will help all of you.

Hi Dean,

What are the settings of your MAMethod (sma, ema,smma or lwma) and Price Field (high/low or close/close)?

I have checed the latest template of Kevin (5m kevinator retracement system-2.tpl) was set with Price Field of close/close and the earlier version was high/low. I am not sure which one to use.

Thanks for your advise.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I didn't ask you to suggest, I already have real account on one of this brokers, but the platform is crashing, that why I asked you maybe on your broker i can monitor charts and make demo trades while I'm troubleshooting the problem with this platforms.

Never mind, your thread, your rules, I'm away from here you are to protective and pretentious. But I like your method.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Thx for your help I'll try to fix the problem.

Hi Harry,

on the color stoach i have not touched anything but the tf and setting for 60 to 14,3,3 and 240 to 10,3,3.. that's it.. rest is all keept with the original default.

good luck

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Hi

I think you'll find the answer to your problem is that when you load your chart it is in a time frame other than 5 minutes.

Let us know if that was the problem.

My charts load in the 60 min time frame and that gives me "the snake" until I change to the 5 minute time frame when "the snake" changes into a step.

Di

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Thanks Dean.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
socastich is repinted? , 240 TF is repainted?

--- 帖子 #752 ---
yes Di..  i got the visualization on the 5M only... on other tf it would go back to the snake look.

I only look at the 5M tf chart anyways.. no need to cross our eyes in all TF's considering the constant scanning of 5-10 pairs.. lol

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Two fine gentlemen indeed, it worked wonderfully well, and my view of this trading system is very very much clearer. One question though you both use different time frames ??? I am using 5 min scalping,should I drop the time frame to 05 min ????.....once again many thanks, and when in Western Australia pop in for a glass of RED NED or five, it should be a merry olde time. THX. Bill.

This is the trade I made earlier from my laptop now I'm trying to fix Metatrader on my desktop, I hope that doesn't mind that I'm posting a little bit later, but its live and still open trade. Eur/Usd + 80 pips

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Well, market has slow down in mass and it's just pulling a slow one direction move on most pairs without giving us the decent MOM setup... this is were PATIENCE plays a big role as to wait for the good setups..

* if it keeps going in one direction, to wait PATIENTLY for the valid PB to opposite side of the bands..

* if it's looking to reverse, making sure not jumping the gun too quickly and prematurely when going against the trend use more PATIENCE for more development..

* if its pulling back or just stalling and forming sideways, then to PATIENTLY wait for it to actually build the sideways bands form as then to pick our spot with 60 stoch and overbought/oversold band agreement.

just some words while we are patiently waiting for more action and NYSE open.

Cheers,

ps)

i be back in couple hours.. gotta hit the court for some tennis game.. my other passion..

happy piping to all..

Just want to say thank you for the method you shared. it's gold. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
yes you are quite right 60 min was the starting point it seems, thanks for the input .It really does make a difference to your trading style ... I just could not make it work for me....here's hoping things may change. THX bill.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi,

I see that your 5-minute trading style is profitable for you.  I am currently looking into it.  However, I am checking how to get the 15-minute chart to work with my system.  I hope you don't mind.  I also use the TMA (the non-repaint version).

Have you tried your system in 15 min? What is your insight on higher TF?

Thanks again.

Forexforex

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Glad that was the answer.

Whilst I have my set currencies to trade, every now and then I pull up a "foreign" currency so had to work out how to replace the snake with a step. You just expect charts to load in the time frame you're examining...............it's just another way the universe makes sure you're paying attention to detail in my view ( lol ).

It's five and a half years since I had posted on a forum. I only used FF for the calendar but scanned what topics were listed as the top threads. The name caught my attention (maybe in sympathy with our deposed former PM). Thie thread was relatively new but boy, has it caught my attention. I'm so glad I took the time to read it.

Many thanks Kevin.It's a wonderful system.

hello, somebody can tell me if mt trendline repeat

very very googs metod kavin  ajaja i love you

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Hi All

as I am trying to scan as many possible low spread pairs as possible (and often from my laptop so SMALL screen!!) I have re-written and improved the alerting capabilities.

In this version it is also easier to see the last step (up/down) for both stochs as this is displayed as text at the left of the indicator.

There are 2 indicators required:-

TMA Called - this just needs to be in your indicators folders - DO NOT add it to your chart

!Kevinator - this replaces the color stochastics indicators being used for 1 & 4 hr, both are in the same indicator

The defaults should be fine as specified by what Kevinator uses.

The only parameters you need to worry about are

a) if you use a different CCI period than 8

b) how stringent you want the MOM trades to be

By default a possible MOM trade will be alerted for long if:-

Both stochs are stepping up

CCI is now above 0 and was previously below 0

Current price is below the mid line

(reverse obviously for short)

If you wish to be less stringent with MOM trades (ie, for strong trending markets when price doesnt always retrace back to the opposite band)

you can set the parameter xb_MOM.Mid to false

then the price needs only to have retraced to the upper line for long trades, lower line for short trades

A possible long scalp trade will be alerted if:-

Hourly stoch is stepping up

CCI is now above 0 and was previously below 0

Current price is below the mid line

(reverse obviously for short)

Trade signals are based on the current bar to give the earliest possible  indication, just because a signal is given within a bar doesn't mean  that by the time the bar ends the signal is still valid.

NOTE:- an alert is a poor substitute for scanning the charts manually, but sometimes can be helpful

Regards

John

Takes experience.

Run with us for a week and you will have seen what the market is capable of and will have a better idea of your tp.

This morning we were focusing on MOM trades and some traders were holding their positions and now sit far on top of the hill if you look at the current Eurusd chart and look back 8 hrs.

Some traders are going top of TMA to bottom of TMA and exit...waiting for another setup.

It is up to you to manage your money.It is up to us to put you on better trade setups.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I have been resting for a while and noticed that there were many trade setups during the last 7hrs.If you folllowed the system you should have been wildly successful.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
While we are waiting for the market to pull back into another trade setup lets do a little excercise.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
at first thanks to Kevinator, who shared his system here.

i have read your system rule, but until now, i still can't figure out, what is the function of double cci woody indicator...?

and is there a possibility to use kevinator to trade gold/silver?

i used to use Fibonacci, elliot wave, and candle stick pattern to trade gold/silver, but recently the result is not good.

May you have spare time to answer my question.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
MOM= MOMentum

240 or 4hr mtf stoch will determine direction.

When price hits TMA band in the opposite direction of the current 4hr mtf stoch price will reverse with a energy release in the direction of the 4Hr mtf stoch.

Price surge, pull back, energy release.     Price surge, pull back, energy release.

That is 160 pips on this pair in last 8 hrs alone.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Any questions or comments?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hi kevin,

Firstly,thanks for your system,i have been quietly following along with a few demo trades,all profitable,but i will start posting very soon with my live trades..

Just a qiuck question regards the TMA,are the setting default coz i find my tma is sometimes very narrow.

Thanks again,keep up the great work

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Hello traders,

is my first trade using this system so i would like to know your opinion on the setup.

I enter on the close of the momentum bar that broke the previous lows and set my TP on the round 62000 number (a bit earlier at 62055 just for being sure with the spread).

I have to wait 3 hours for the stochastics (1h and 4h) to point in the same direction.

How do you see this setup?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Try setting 45 on TMA.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Thanks for your system!  Currently testing it.

Is there already an alert for possible entry.  If someone already made the alert setup, please repost it.  I really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Get the new indicators from post #765.

That is exactly right. You only need to follow the 4h mtf stoch for trend direction.

We are working on long positions this week.

60m stoch is for short trades +10 ,+20, AFTER you have made the MOM trades of the day.240 is for the big account numbers     60M is for extra money trades.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Can someone look at the current gbpusd chart and pick the MOM trades out?

Post the chart so I can see what you are looking at.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hi Kevinator,

Can you, once and for all, tell us what is the correct settings for the Stochastic indicators, whether it is 5m, 60m, 240m.   There has been few settings I saw in my readings.  Thanks in advance for your response.

forexforex

--- 帖子 #781 ---
This is pure exercise and if you set your TMA value to 45 you may have a different result.

John has updated the indicators on post 765.Thank you for your comments and concerns.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
My chart....

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Just closed +50

--- 帖子 #784 ---
my chart, is this correct?

--- 帖子 #785 ---
We are all being brought up to speed as to what is going on.

Three strategies.

1st) 60M/Last week we focused on taking short trades for quick 10, or 20 pips.

To do this we used the 60m stoch only.We have been getting used to scanning charts for setups.Entering trades on the rf finder and exiting trades with profit.

2nd)240/ This week we are focusing on MOM or momentum trades.We are looking at the 4hr chart  and buying and selling according to the direction of the 4hr stoch.When price pulls back to the top of the TMA on a down 4hr stoch we sell and vice versa.

We are doing strictly 240 this week.

3rd)60m and 240m/ Next week we put it all together and Mix the methods.We will be taking every pip that is not tied down.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Both charts are correct.........That is 100+ pips on that chart.

Lets think big and multitask....open 7 charts and get a pen and paper and begin to follow the charts around.

Write down the 7 pairs..then the direction of the 4 hr stoch and keep be aware of the direction.

Start to stalk the trades!!  Something should be close to being in position every few hours.

If you trade this way you will capture the bulk of the daily trend everyday.

After all you want the trend which is the meat and throw away the bone which is the pull back.

We are not interested in the pullback only the energy release of the trend.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
I am not going to argue with you about this....

Both indicators are set to 45....10 minutes ago the TMA called is was not in the same path of the TMA(true) and jumped that far off course.

So your indicator is giving a different result.

TMA in this system is supposed to be active just like the center of gravityCOG.

I have been using this system for a while and this is way more energy than I usually will dedicate to someone trying to get me to change indicators.

I have had tma true indicator for a very long time.It is not what we need in the system.

Thanks but no thanks...system is set already and laid out....the end of it.

Kevin,

Would you keep selling these sort of setups regardless if the 4hr stoch is in oversold territory(as is the case with gbp and euro etc) after they retrace to the top of the TMA?

OR any caution on your part when these things are extremely O/B O/S??

I know from 1st hand that sometimes the stoch can flatline around 0 or 100 and market can continue its rise or fall. Very interested to get your insight on this kevin.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Is there anyway for the retracement finder to send an alert that also tells the direction of the bar ie: up or down?  I have it set to send me a text message but would be nice to know the direction also.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Post a chart and explain what you are saying.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hi

Kevinator my TMA indicator say on halfLength  value 56.

Do you now say we change that to 45.??

Sorry but I really want to be at the page as all you great traders

Peter

--- 帖子 #792 ---
kevin to be clear, TMA is 56 or 45?

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Ok maybe this is clearer????

--- 帖子 #794 ---
56 is default but 45 is more aggressive setting and will get you in more trades.

Also for everyone please take 30 mins and scroll back to middle of last month and pick MOM setups. Mark them with your line tool and count how many pips you could have made.

This will give you a better idea of the pips you can expect in the future.

The more trade setups you see the better you will get.

Each of these setups are like footballl plays in the playbook.

Just like the football players you must know your plays and be able to run your routes.

The route being the trade setup.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
The stoch has been oversold all day long.

Do not try to imagine a reversal.Let the market reverse itself..do not try and guess.

Keep pushing lower as long as the Mtf stoch is still selling.

Absolutely when price hits the high TMA and stoch is still red keep selling.

The trend could last for days or be over tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Hi Kev,

Hi Kevin,

I'm following this thread for a few days and started yesterday trading your system on my demo account. It's an amazing system! I have some trading experience, have my own systems, tried a lot of others, and it's hard to find a good and yet easy system that can give nice profits. Your system is easy to setup, and when the market has nice swinging moves it's magic... Of course no system is 100% waterproof, but with this system and some experience, it makes you happy at the end of the trading day.

So thanks for sharing this!

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Kevin,

Great job on your thread, I love your enthu.

I will be posting some charts soon

Is that the Semafor indi?  If so how do you handle the repainting issue?

Thanks.

Its part of the trendline indi,i only look at the trendlines and have no concern whether the sema's repaint or not

why would you short eurusd at that point, the hourly stoch has been bullish for the last couple of hours (admittedly without much movement)

You are completely right, but every pip you can take... :-) You can't expect a long run down on this point, that's true.

Hi Kevin,

I just came across this thread, thank you very much for your kindness to share such a profitable system with all of us.

I have started setting up my chart using rules that you have mentioned.

Yesterday during US session, i managed to open 2 trades, on GBPUSD & AUDUSD each.

GBPUSD +30pips

AUDUSD -10pips

AUDUSD sell trade, hit my SL after that it go back to right direction of sell whole night long. I place SL at previous swing high but it still not enough.

Can you tell me based on your experience on this system, how you set SL & TP value for each trade?

I saw you posted a lot great trade with profitable example here but do you face any DD of wrong signal with this system although following the rules?

As i know , no system is perfect right? I just want to know what is the profitable and drawndown % of this system?

How do you deal with news release especially UK & US session?

Will you hold your trade when there is high impact news going to release in 15mins time although all the criteria are met for open trade?

Hopefully you can help to clear my doubt so that i more understand of this system.

Regards,

Ryan

can anyone help me.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hi

The MTF stoch does not repaint.

Its a dynamic indicator.

so when you put a 60 mins indicator on a 5 mins chart.

That indicator can change its mind according to price threw that hour.

12x5 = 60.  mean that we have 12 5 mins candle in an hour.

and looking on MTF 240 mins stoch gives 12x4= 48  5 mins candles in 4Hour

Hope it helps a bit

Cicak,

open the Navigatro where you have your indicators stored.. than drag out the color stoch in the same box that you got already open... than set the setting for the 4hr...

ft 240.. kperiod 10.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
no its not... trend is clearly bearish...

in order to take the reversal you need at least the 1hr stoach to be stepping up... at moment it is stepping down still and it show in your own chart as well.

i recommend for you to study the first post of Kevin and some of his other Live trade examples.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
good morning all,

just took an e/u trade according to h4 stoch. SL is now at BE and trade is +12 at the moment. let's see how far it goes up...

edit: stopped out @ BE with the London opening.  I guess I should have taken the profit when it reached to +10 or +15...

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Bullish trend!

4hr stoch is up up up.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Cicak

John posted a useful indicator called !Kevinator in Post # 765 on page 51 where not only does it give you both the MTF's in the same window by loading the one windicator, it also shows on the right hand side the direction of the 1 hour and 4 hour time periods, which is very helpful when the indicators are running along the top or bottom and merge into each other.

A copy of his chart showing the !Kevinator indicator is in Post # 768 on page 52 of the thread.

You can of course drag the color stoch as mentioned by P.Dean.

Hi everyone..

i see some discussion about MOM trade... i show you guys one in the making..

first of all earlier today we have had some nice overbough/oversold trade which i have shown one in the e/u chart below..

now.. as you see that trade has broken the band and turned e/u into some sort of a bearish trend or direction.. good enough to keep eye on for mom trade..

as you see in the pic.. when you spot such moves than you look for PA to clearly pullback to close to the opposite band of 4hr stoach..

at moment both 4hr and 1hr stoach are stepping down... PA in reaching and is pretty close to opposit band and the very next RF bar that we get is good enough to go for a MOM trade.

if it happens i will trade it live and i hope you do as well.

I hope it helps to recognize and anticipate such setups better for all.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
for short term scalp trade you don't need the 4hr .. you need the 1hr to be stepping..

--- 帖子 #827 ---

TQVM, i shall upload the indicator.

that is a better option cic... i did not know about the new indies by John..

thanks Di.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
This is the MOM trade just talked about..

--- 帖子 #830 ---
but the RF gave us the signal when price is below the lower TMA band. Is that the right enrty?

--- 帖子 #831 ---
P.Dean This is wrong. This is a MOM trade. look at post 775

MOM= MOMentum

240 or 4hr mtf stoch will determine direction.

When price hits TMA band in the opposite direction of the current 4hr mtf stoch price will reverse with a energy release in the direction of the 4Hr mtf stoch.

Price surge, pull back, energy release. Price surge, pull back, energy release.

That is 160 pips on this pair in last 8 hrs alone.

Hello,

First, thanks a lot Kevinator for this great system, now I have closed 28 pips profit for eur/usd... also more pips with eur/jpy

--- 帖子 #834 ---
are you kidding me..

your telling me that e/u in the last 4hrs is not bearish and its bullish... you can just look at the damn chat and see it bearish.. no to mention that the 4hr stoach is showing as such too.

I am speachless.. lol

--- 帖子 #835 ---
So P-Dean you making it up as you go now?

The stoch is green on the EUR/USD, from what I read you trade whats happening and NOT what has happend 4 hours ago.

So since the 4hr stoch is green then its bullish.

ps. Don't be rude to people, your a novice with a 2 bit cheap system.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Although you have shown what was apparently an overbought trade on the EU in that post, I happened to be practising taking screenshots at the time and as you can see it was not overbought, in fact up until just before I took the screenshot which was way after the large down candle the 4hr was (on my chart) green, so would have missed that altogether.  Just pointing out that it is not as it appears in your image.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
another probe on e/u... I feel like I'm playing with fire but everything seems to be in order according to the strategy. I hope I won't get burned...

edit: stop is @ BE now, hope it makes up to +20...

--- 帖子 #838 ---
My comment was to the guy who was asking about G/U who is trying to put up a scalp trade which 1hr stoach is the concern..

and i repeat the 4hr stoach on the e/u is bearish.. we has a 100 pips drop on e/u starting 4hrs ago..

i don't know what your watching

--- 帖子 #839 ---
There is no such thing as over bought/sold in trending markets with the stochastic.

During trending markets indicators such as the stochastic will stay within their over sold/bought zones for the majority of the trend, as these indicators readings are capped with how high and low they can go 0-100 they will stay within that zone during strong trends.

All of this over bought/sold stuff is novice talk, and it is one of the thing/problems that leads new and novice traders to fail.

Yes there is pullbacks within trends but if price is falling and it pullsback, it does not mean its over bought, vice-versa for longs, remb one thing the stochastic is an oscillator, it was built/created/mathamaticlly programmed for ranging bound markets, not for trends.

So basiclly you are using a screwdriver to hammer in a nail.

first of all I was not rude to anyone.. I don't know where you got that from.. i was just trying to help the guy out.

now..

the band may have changed over course of time and so on and may not looked to be to top to look oversold.. i was not here at the time... but the point of my post was mostly to show the start of the move down and the pullback and the release once it touches or gets close to opposite band to show a example of MOM setup in the making..

now I apologize  for doing so and helping out.. i stay quiet..

however.. would you care to show us couple of Live trade of your own so we can learn from such a great professional and a none-novice trader.

happy piping to all.

I dont' trade this system, I trade my own price action system and I would be happy to start a thread on FF soon showing it.

Iam just curious to see the system here, but I will not be using it for a few reasons.

1: The people running this thread are misleading, its novice lead novice using the wrong tools in the wrong market.

2: I have just witnessed today and yesterday people being manipulated to trade such a weak system with no regard to whats happening on the econommic calander, one guy has just posted less than 5 mins ago with his chart asking what "just happened" the advice being given here is very weak and misleading to new taders and traing such a silly little indicator based system through these news events is out of order.

London today is jammed with econommic releases from CHF, EURO, GBP and then CAD-USD.

You are trying to dodge bullets all day up/down up/down up/down on a 5 minute chart.

REALLY?

ASK kEV FOR PROOF, DO NOT JUST TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT!

Ask him to open an myFXbook account and that will track all his demo account trades and show you if hes profitable or not!

Also hes the only so called "pro" trader I know that trades both a demo and alledged "real" account, why not just screenshot his real account chart, why would you place trades on a demo and real....

Again a myFXbook account would put this to bed, it takes no time and effort to set up, and will track all his demo trades for him and publicly show them.

Until you have SOLID proof that he is profitable with this system then you are being very very silly indeed and throughing your money away at the advice of some novice in his PJ's on his laptop in his beedroom with MOM down stairs.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hi All

again to make things easier for me as often I have to work from a small screen.....

because MT4 rescales the charts constantly sometimes the TMA bands can look close together when in actual fact there is quite a bit of distance in terms of pips between them.

without getting the crosshairs out - this can be hard to see, and has meant in the past I have not taken some trades because on initial glance the distance to the next band didn't seem worth it (we are talking mainly the short term scalps not the MOM trades).

I have made a slight modification to the TMA indicator to display the distances in Pips between the Bid price and the bands.

NOTE:  NO MODIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE TO THE LOGIC OF TMA

ok, 2nd trade hit the TP @ +20 ...

--- 帖子 #847 ---
It's up to you to have an opinion and to not use this system. I just know that I just started using this system and it makes a lot of hits. When you're trading on lower timeframes, news is less important because you take small positions. Of course news also reflects on the lower timeframes but it's easier to anticipate on a lower timeframe than on higher timeframes.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Unbelievable,

I am amazed at some people sometimes.I sit here and post live trade after live trade after live trade and he wants more proof.

Because he is being counter productive to the theme of this thread and has posted negative morale draining statements he is no longer welcome on this thread.

I have fired many influential members of this forum because I can recognize their jealousy and deceitful ways.

He bashed us and what we are doing here and added he will soon add his own live trading thread.

I do not find that funny or amusing at all.

The fact is that this thread has been an enormous success and there has been a lack of interest elsewhere.We will not apologize or make a excuse for that.

This is a sign of success!!! You must be doing something positive in order for someone to write such a negative statement to someone that has changed so many lives....and its free.

It is probably a friend of a member or a member theirself under another name that I have fired for the outrageous behavior.

I will not tolerate that kind of selfish narcissistic behavior.

What he does not understand is this is bigger than his peers on forex factory.

This is about traders with dying accounts trying to bring them back to health.

This is about new traders trying to learn how to survive and not lose their deposit.

That is why he has been exited from this thread head first through the doors out into the street on his back.

Hey P.Dean, im not telling you that the EU is Bullish. it is bearish.

Hi Kevin, entry point was straight after the magenta up candle where the blue arrow is and was stopped out on the same candle (red arrow). As I have said both 60 and 240 stochs were green prior to and at the time of entry.

Yeah I see

Your being to tight with your stops and you cannot imagine this working so you are compensating your fear of trade failure with a super tight stop loss.

If you did not have that tight stop loss that trade would have been a sucessful one as price hit the top of TMA.

Hi All

just noticed a small display bug in the !Kevinator indicator (after looking at Kevinator's recently posted charts).

This bug only appears if you switch the Stoch timeframes in the parameters AFTER you have already had the indicator on your chart.

ie. load the indicator with the defaults, ie. 1hr, then change to 30m after the indicator has already displayed.

what happens is the little text which shows the Timeframe and Direction is left on and overwritten with the new timeframe

To get rid of the old timeframe object

press CTRL + B to get the objects list

search for the objects with the name "!2TFStoch.Desc.xxx" and "!2TFStoch.Dir.xxx" where xxx is the original timeframe you loaded the indicator with, and then delete them

As stated - this bug is a DISPLAY bug only, the logic is not affected in any way.

Regards, John

I have exited the trades and taken those pips to the bank never to return to my brokers pocket.

I take what is given to me if you have the rebounding account.Take everything and give them back nothing.Survival is your main concern so we exit those trades and go get a cup of coffee.

We are not happy or sad.This is business as usual and we are waiting for another entry point.Emotiions are gone from this situation.

Not scarred or anxious. We have no anxiety and are optimistic about the next trade setup around the corner.

We will be disciplined in our trade execution and not enter to early or to late but when the setup presents itself.

1st of all I have not seen my mother in four years.

I have not lived with her for about 15.

You cast doubt because you do not understand what you are talking about.

You ran up here trying to tell us about "your indicator TMA true" and how the regular tma does this or that,

Obvious cheap attempt to gain some sort of recognition.

I will not allow you or anyone else who are just showing up to tell us about something we have been doing successful for probably the same amount of time you first discovered TMA.

Want to leave...goodbye..

We do not need your negative attitude and nasty comments.

I understand the difference between a valid concern and someone trying to derail the thread.

Anyone can ask anything but when you start spreading false information and you just showed up to the party.

We are gonna have a problem and there going to be a big misunderstanding.

As I said this is not about the fame of your silly indicator.

This is about traders trying to rebound their accounts and not lose their hard earned money.

This is about new traders trying to learn how to better themselves.

If you stand in the way of our progress you will be sited right on the spot.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Thanks for your speedy reply Kevin. I chose a 15 pip SL which I guess is  a little tight for the GU, so the next logical place would have been  just below the previous low at around 27 pips SL and it would have been  taken out, in fact it required a 38 pip SL to reach the upper band (I  have placed a grey TMA true on the chart to indicate the TMA at the  time).

My question has to be, where would you have placed the stop loss Kevin,  as it was a valid trade at the time (with green stochs), or would you  have not used one? If it was a valid loss I accept that, as it is part  of the business.

I am not going to argue with you anymore there are more valid questions out there.

I just plugged 150 pips in two hours live two pages ago,

what is the best time actually to trade. currently i'm trading in 3 major pair GU, EU and AU .

--- 帖子 #880 ---
If you look at the example of past trades.

You would have entered at the bottom of TMA .

A 32 pip drawdown then energy release to the top.

I think only time will give you confidence to trade.You need more experience with the system to overcome that fear in the back or your head that this will not work.

The risk on this trade was 33 pip drawdown.

The reward was 80 pips profit.

Hi Kevin,

Reading your thread with interest but I'm not fully understanding some aspects which I hope you can assist with and may help others.

Is it possible for you to take a screen shot immediately when you take a trade so we can follow with you where you might place a stop or take profit. If you can walk us through some live trades (demo) is ok.

As the indicators are dynamic I find it difficult to understand the full trade process as your screenshots on the 5min charts are usually 30 minutes after the trade, and when I remember my chart I don't see the same setup at that time.

Looking forward to watching you trade from the word go with a screen shot which will help alot of us viewing your thread.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Hi Kevin,

I think this is were I'm confused and hoping a live trade will help.

Post 863 USDCAD, your trade taken example was at 4.30am US EST, and your snapshot was at 5.15am US EST, but when I was looking at it around that 4.25am - 4.30am time when scanning the 4 hour was red. I can see now it is green and I understand this as the indicator is dynamic or repaints, and it looks good but at the time I did not see the trade as the 4 hour was red.

So I can see it clearly afterwards, but if you could walk us through a few trades from the start I think I will understand it more clearly.

Thanks for allowing us to ask questions. Cheers

There are three phases we are going through which lasts three weeks.

60M Mtf stoch and 240 mtf stoch

Last week we were learning how to use the 60m stoch and TMA in order to take short trades of 10and 20 or so pips profit.We made many trades this way with much success.

This week we are focusing on MOM or MOMentum trades which using the 240 stoch as a guide for trend direction and waiting for TMA to hit opposite TMA against the direction of 240 trend then the next rf signail in the direction of the 240 trend which will result in a energy release.20 to 200+ pips profits.Must use discipline and wait for trade setups.

Next week we will put it all together and mix the 60 and 240 techniques of week 1 an 2 for an all out tradeathon.Taking short and long term trades.

If you can negotiate these obsticles successfully this will be a moment of enlightenment.

I did that yesterday and today already and I am here online and will take more trades as the setups occur.

Hi pedross,

This is my first contribution to this thread and first I'd like to thank Kevin for sharing it with us. I have refrained from posting until I had a good understanding of the rules so hopefully i'll make a good contribution rather than saying something stupid (please don't hesitate to tell me if I do).

This week Kevin is concentrating on the MOM setup and the 4H Stoch rather than the RF setup and the 1H Stoch (last week).

I think some of the confusion has risen because some people are mixing both strategies before getting to know each one properly; if I heard Kevin well, next week will be about using both to extract as much as possible from each market: making pips from the main 4H strategy in one direction (Long for example) while at the same time grabbing pips during any Short pullback using the 1H strategy.

Edit: looks like Kevin beat me to it (see his post 888 above lol)

Hi kevinator

I am looking at usd/jpy at the moment for a sell, what do you think?

Thanks

Hi Kevin,

I've been reading the thread from the start and I understand the process you are taking us through, with the various setups, but I'm finding it difficult to have the moment of enlightment because I need to see a live trade to fully see how each phase works.

If you could do a couple of MOM tonight if they setup, and even some short term that you taught from last weeks would be great too.

Like post 883, that would have been great to watch live, if you post the screenshot straight away, then you would have been able to talk us through how you handle the drawdown and whether or when a stop would come into play and then when you take your trade of the table.

What I would like to see is as soon as you scan a setup and you take the trade on demo, post the screen and walk us through from there.

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Yes Kevin, that would be great and much help

Hi Logic38,

This is my take on $/Yen at the moment (80.75 as I type)

1) 4H stoch are red (down): this is the most important (it favours shorts)

2) 1H stoch are green (up): if you are looking for a short term long trade then look for the price to be at the bottom of the TMA and then an UP Magenta bar for a quick 10/20 pips, possibly to the top of the TMA band.

But because of 1), I would be more inclined to look for a short setup

3) the short setup would need:

a) the price at or above the top of the TMA band

b) depending on whether you are a more conservative trader or not, you could wait for

1) a down Magenta bar

2) 1H stoch goes red (down)

or simply take the short at the TMA band. In both cases, initial Target Point would be near the bottom of the TMA at 80.57

I welcome any comment if I have got anything wrong

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Same thing here

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Thanks Kevin,

Watching now, so look forward to learning.

Confirming you're Short EURJPY 113.89 for MOM trade, which will spring off TMA for a long termish trade.

anyone just call me Oli (much shorter lol)

i know it's not part of Kevin's strategies but reading some of the posts from the start, some less experienced traders seem to be unaware of data releases & news event;

forexfactory has got a great calendar so make use of it (clicking on the 'detail' + 'chart' icons is a great way to learn what each is all about and how it might affect the pairs that you trade)

Kevin if you will allow me a moment.  None of this is trying to be negative just concerns/questions about the system and how things are done.

I stumbled upon this thread by accident, I actually clicked on the wrong link while it was on the first page.  I've been looking at it cause something about this had me interested.

First love the mom trades.

1.  Yes, in a trending environment a stoch can and will stay in an overbought or oversold level for a VERY long time.  If you actually see the 5 min stoch much of the time when it hits the far bands, the 5 min info is showing the opposite of the OB or OS of the 4 hr.  So basically we are buying/selling on a pull back once price action starts to go back in the direction of the original trend.  If you look at a higher TF charts you would not even see that blip on the screen.

2.  The other thing I like about this are the indicators, and this is coming from a guy that normally trades naked.  Loving the MTF stoch.

3.  It can get the new folks looking at some price action and let them see the where and hows price is moving and that will help them incredibly over the trading career.

Kevin, I do have some concerns/questions for you I would like to ask about.

1.  yesterday I asked about trading into news and never got a response.  Over time it is a common belief, mine also, that is very dangerous.  I understand if you have a longer term trade on you may keep it on depending how far into profit you are.  how do you handle news?

2.  Support and resistance.  If you notice a level of S/R 10 pips in front of the trade for example, do you still take it blindly or would you pass on the trade.  Again, this is something that would have people concerned about the trades as I can say I personally will filter those trades out as not a high percentage trade.  Once again, that is me personally and how I trade.

3.  Money Management.  Kevin, if this is a thread of live trades is to help new and failing traders I feel this is something that must be talked about.  I understand this has a lot to do with the trader's own personality and trading style but it must be something they understand.  You've had a few traders in here totally confused about when they should get out and why.  These are valid questions you have point blank refused to answer.  Understanding why, where, and how to get out of trade can be even more important than how to get into it.

4.  From looking at the system, and from what i know about trading, this system could (maybe should?) trade different depending on weather the pair/market are trending or not.  What is your take on this?

Kevin,

I think answering some of these questions would really help a lot of people and also stop some of the people that come on the this thread and act as a distraction.

Also as a fellow skeptical person on the forum cause I've seen it and been burnt before you have to understand to a degree why people have a hard time believing.

the reason I do not post my charts on this thread is cause I do trade your system fairly differently than you are here and I do not want to detract from what you are doing, cause it is your thread and I respect that.  Your system, the way you trade it, does not match my personality so I modified a little to help with that.  Also, in a different thread where I did do a lot of posts and stuff I got much of the same you are getting right now and don't feel like dealing with it at this point in my life.

Sorry for the long post but I hope you take this as concerns and not slamming you.

Wish everyone the best of pips!

Hi John,

I got a bit of a concern here..

on the stoach box i have pointed out with the blue line where the 1hr display says down but the actual steps are up..

can you check that to see what seemed to be the problem

--- 帖子 #904 ---
hi P.Dean

yes it's a bit confusing, I am thinking of making a mod

the step you marked at the time of the screen print was not actually the previous step, it was the step before

the step which is marked as down simply cannot be seen because the step value is too small from bar 1 to 0

if you look at the data manager window the actual values can be seen

will think of a solution to this

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #905 ---
have way too many versions of the same indi on my laptop

I accidentally uploaded the wrong version of !kevinator v1

I have deleted the ones in the original post and am reposting here.

Note:- this does not address the concerns of P.Dean in the previous post which I am still looking for a viable solution to.

Once again my apologies.

ok bud thank you..

however before making the post i thought about the value and may not be able to see it but on other hand the PA is moving up and its indication that the value should be up too...

News trading is the single key driver of the market.Without it there would be no market movement at all.There is always someone speculating or reacting to some news event.

Interest rate decisions are the number one news event in the market today.Governments move large pools of money to the country that can provide the best rate of return and the FOMC minutes anouncement is the best event to follow.Non farm and employment are mid level drivers.

We do not concern ourselves with these anouncements because we are not spike traders.In fact we encourage those large spikes here because they are either the push to put us at the top or part of the pull back to TMA entry.

Money management is your concern.I am not a accountant and do not know your balance,broker or personal financial goals.My role is to put you on  better trade setups faster.You determine your risk and reward.

As long as all the signals match and are valid we will take positiions.We look to the 240 for confirmation which is the major trend.

I can deal with any and all situations that arise on this forum.I am aware that 97% of traders on this forum are good and genuinely want to learn.I am also aware that there are alot of traders with thousands of posts who still have a day job and have failed to learn anything of use and are interested in their own prestige and not in the assistance of other traders success.

The other 3% are like computer viruses.They cruise from thread to thread with the same concerns?Does it repaint?What kind of money do you make?Why this and why that? Every indicator of any use in metatrader repaints for the simple reason that they report things as they are now.

They are the type that has not realized that fact and are still trying to find that one stand alone indicator.It does not exist...to get around this problem we use a combination of indicators in a "system".

I am not offended by your questions as I can tell that they are real concerns and not the one sided questions of a angry person stating an angry point in the form or a question....do you understand what I am saying by that statement?

I wish success to the community and more profit to everyone.

So exit was at the bottom of the TMA.

I was answering another question while this was happening.

240 up now so we will take lower tma buys now until it changes again.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Both stochs were green-up

Pete

--- 帖子 #912 ---
one possible solution would be to have a vertical line in the indicator panel only (so it doesnt mess up the actual price action chart) on each new mtf period - then it would be easy to see when one mtf stoch bar ends and a new one starts when there is next to no difference in the value (as is usually the case in the first few 5min bars after the mtf change).

if I can't think of a better solution by the end of the day, I will add this as an option with the ability to switch it off if no-one wants it.

of course if anybody has any better solutions to this problem I would appreciate the help.

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Okay, a quick one for clarity if you don't mind.

What my concern about news trading is this.  If at 8:25 a signal hit, you would take it not knowing the results in 5-10 minutes?  I agree that news will move the market to points that make for some awesome trades getting momentum moving in a direction.

Thanks for your answer and clarity on this one.  I will move back to my own personal cubby hole and continue my trading and reading your thread.

Simple

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Thanks Kevin for the live trade. Good timing to get out just before the news spike, went straight up to 114.10. So the MOM trades you get out at 20 pips too, I thought we were looking for around the 50 to 60 pips with week 2.

I understand you can't backtest this system as the indicators are dynamic and therefore most trades are winners after the event when you scroll back through the charts, that's what I was finding confusing as most of the example charts were 30 minutes after the trade so they were all winning.

I'm glad you did a live trade, unfortunatley you were posting at the time so you couldn't tell us your exit. I will continue learning as more live screen shot trades get posted at the time of entry. It helps alot.

Good luck with your trades.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
If you mean 8:25 on the first friday of the month and nonfarm is to be released at 8:30.Yes I would take the trade.

During the evening hours I have gotten the large spike from the audusd emplyment release trading the system.

Last month I got one for 90 pips in the evening trading audusd.This month last week I have the trade live on this thread somewhere.

So yes I am aware of the news events (major and medium) but I do not let them dictate my trading as the system will keep me on the right side of the news spike.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Kevin,

Great system, thanks for kind sharing here.

I'm testing stoch with M30 compare to H1.

Seem more trade if we use M30 stoch right?

M30 will give us more scalping trade.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Listen smithy

I understand what you are trying to imply by saying "I thought that the news trade would yield us all 50 pips".

You got 20 alright.....do not get me started.

I am up 175 pips today.I would be up more if I did not have to be tested on my ability.

Even if we would have lost 40 we still would be in positive territory and looking for more as the day is not done.

For those who are very critical..... maybe this trading is not for you and if you need 50 pips every trade you can find it elsewhere.

For those of you trying to rebound your acount or just learning.........I am here for you and take the money to the bank.....Keep moving and begin to antiicipate these trade setups..

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Why not put a dot for each candle like the attached? Then you can clearly see what color the MTF stoch is currently and what it was in the past for each candle.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
jmw1970,

Can you do me a favor?

I still like to use original stochastic that posted in 1st post which i reattached here, so that i can see difference timeframe step up and down clearer.

what i need is, can you help to add in H1 up / down display for this indicator so that it make very clear signal for me.

Thanks in advance. Attached File(s)   Color Stochastic v1[1].04.ex4

A good setup....But missed it

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hi Pete,

If both were green then technically there was nothing wrong with taking a Long near the bottom of the TMA once you get an UP magenta bar for a quick 10/20 pips to the top of the TMA.

I will say this though: around the time of both entries the 4H stoch, although slightly green, was still very low (9.3514 on my chart) and we were quite clearly still in a downtrend; as you know the market can carry on staying oversold for a long time but still make make new lows (effectively that trade could be seen as trying to 'pick a bottom' and these trades are notoriously dangerous - on these occasions, I would try to put my stop at b/e asap).

Also, but i can't confirm, i believe that the #MT-Trendline was pointing down too at the time.

With these 2 factors in mind, it might have been more prudent to wait for the market to hit the top of the TMA bands and take a short trade once the MOM criteria are all aligned (see posts 892/896/897 for a similar setup on usd/jpy earlier on today).

I know that it's easier to say all this with hindsight as GBP ended up going further down, but with a pair like Cable that can move a lot and fast, these 'pick a bottom trade' need fast fingers and good money management for your s/l place. I would be more confident in scoring 'pick a bottom' pips on a slower moving pair

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Kevin and John,

Thanks for your great work!!!! The new !kevinator V1 indicator the text to the right is not showing sometimes it becomes hard to see the 4 hour Mtf stocastics. Also i find the settings for 60 mins MTF being 14,3,3 and 240 mins MTF being 10,3,3 should it not be the same.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Hi Kevin and traders,

Cubbybgood told me about your system and I am truly grateful for your generosity and mentorship. I'm not quite up to speed with all of the training, but I'm a hard worker. I'll get there.

I had a quick question for all of you. Does the MT Trendline not refresh on it's own? I'm seeing where I have to switch TF's to force it to update....

Great system, I'm training with it now, but I expect great things. My demo trading has been easy and stress free with this system. Excellent mentorship from a pro, Kevin, and he's got my vote as Trader of the Year! :-)

Warm regards and good trading to you all!

As for auto trendline this indicator does a good job, please check it out.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Hi Aries,

dont know when you downloaded the indicator, but check the latest version, this fixes the problem with the text.

no the settings 14,3,3 for 1h and 10,3,3 for 4h are correct.

yes the 4hr stochs can be hard to see if they remain for a long time in OB/OS especially at close to 100 or 0 levels - for instance on my GU the 4hr stoch has been at close to 0 for the last few hours.

Be confident though that the stochs are there.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi John (and others),

For the stoch setting, in the 'Common' Tab, I always make sure that the fixed minimum/maximum are NOT ticked; i've found that especially if you have both 4H & 1H in the same window, they are easier to read in o/b & o/s conditions (i think).

--- 帖子 #930 ---
aries/john/punisher...

there is only one small drawback  (no such thing as a free lunch lol):

if you look at the chart in close up, then sometimes it can give you the impression that one of the stochs is higher than where it actually is (see Untitled1).

but when you look at the bigger picture (which you should always do in trading lol) it shows you exactly were it is (see Untitled2).

But even in the close up view, simply putting your mouse over the stoch will show you the value

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Hi John,

Seems like there is a display problem on the text the new version of the !kevinator but the stocastics look better after olivier gave us a trick. Its been a profitable system and so accurate. here is a screen shot of the setup. Have added supertrend nrp mtf with time period 15mins,which confirms the trend also can be used as a stoploss. and the moutouki trendline. The stocastic indicator is the old one.

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Thanks Oli, your response to my dilemma re: the earlier GU trade was both  clear and insightful and in hindsight a little neglectful on my  part to say the least.

Indeed I should have seen the down trend (drawn a TL or used MT  TLine(which I'll check out)) and traded according to what was before me  at the time and not as you say, tried to pick a bottom for a long  trade.

Penny is starting to drop now...

Many thanks again,

Pete

ps. re: stochs- I never thought of de-ticking the fixed min max either!

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Hi Aries

what is the problem with the text - I have looked at your screen shot and the text states that both stochs are up, which they are..

or do you mean that this is !Kevinator not !Kevinator v1 - if so then v1 from post #908 works

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #934 ---
just took this short MOM trade

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Hi Kevin,

On post 912 you show a chart and you have the 240 Stoch and the 30 min Stoch. Not sure why that is, I thought we were using the 240 and 60 combo.  That was a bit confusing to me.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
I think you're a bit hard on yourself here: Kevin & I agreed from our respective posts that apart from the downtrend, you ticked all other 4 boxes for a long trade based on the 1H stoch/RF strategy:

1) 4H stoch green (a bonus)

2) 1H stoch green

3) price having gone below the TMA and rising above it

4) you had your magenta bar

Also bear in mind that every trend that changes will likely start with the 1H stoch changing first.

There were a few other possible Long Sterling trades based on the 1H strategy (2) 3) & 4)) since then (all London times); these are based on how the stoch looks now (it might have been different then but at least you can see what i mean):

.09.05: i would not take it, too close to top TMA

.11.35: 19 possible pips & 9 pips drawdown

.13.45: 29 possible pips & 5 pips drawdown

.14.35: i would not take it, too close to top of TMA

.15.10: 14/32 possible pips & 15 pips drawdown

.15.35: i would not take it, too close to top of TMA

So you see, there are pips to be made even counter-trending and on most occasions a 16 pips (+ spread) stop loss would have been enough.

THIS IS ONLY MY VIEW AND ANYONE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT/DISAGREE...:

I suggest that you (and anyone else that hasn't got years of trading behind them), pick just 1 pair and study it day after day to get a good feel for it with both 1H & 4H strategies; there is a normal tendency because there are so many pairs available to want to trade loads of them at the same time, but from my experience, it's better to be really good with one pair than average with many ("jack of all trades and master of none" type of thing). Once you're proficient with one pair, introduce another and so on. I appreciate that there are many that can instantly grasp a strategy and apply it to any instrument, but this is for the others like me who aren't little Einsteins lol

Keep a written journal where for each signal you keep a track of things like: time of signal, drawdown, most pips achievable, after how many pips could you have put your stop at b/e ... and anything else that you feel is relevant to YOUR way of trading (it's a known fact that give 10 traders the same exact strategy and you will get 10 different amounts of pips achieved). Get to 'know' your chosen pair, get a feel of how it moves and behaves.

Most important: you will not be wasting any time doing this even if you only paper trade:

1) the market and all pairs will still be there tomorrow

2) Kevin's strategies are such that you will rarely have to wait a long time to get a new signal.

Last but not least, a big thank you to Kevin for sharing this with us.

USDCHF - ok trading against the hourly stoch but inline with the 4hrly, hopefully the hourly will come also start to fall

Trading plan is this:- if the price gets to the lower band but hourly stoch is still up then will treat as a short term trade and exit, if price gets to the bottom and hourly stoch has changed to down, then will treat as a true MOM trade and move stop to b/e and see how much i can get

- of course all of this is assuming price moves in my direction - otherwise stop gets hit!!!

EDIT: Well it's taken a while and still not at bottom band, but finally the hourly stoch has come into line with the 4hr, so have moved the stop to b/e and will let it ride

EDIT 2: Stopped out at +1.5 pips, probably not the best time of the day to try my first MOM trade, but everything is a learning experience.

Hi jmw1970,

Can you upload this vertical line version ?

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Hi Kevin,

thanks again.

To share with you this simple trading method, I do not have to wait for more than 3 hours to make 80 pips net.

Since I'm new to your strategy, I only place half of my usual lot sizes.

For both of the trades above , I only place 5 standard lot size for trying it out.

IMO, to new traders to this system, please be patient and wait for proper set-up to appear before your. You don't have to take all singal to be sucessful, but find a good entry (and don't forget your SL).

Hope everyone is enjoying making pips here. Bye

Love,

Miss Cute

Hi Dehyah

I think your stop might of been too close, it should have been at least at the previous swing low at around .8492

in addition for the short "in-band" moves the closer you are to the middle line on entry the riskier the trade, you really want to be at the opposite band.

Hi Jane,

it is Range Bar with 8 pips Bar Range.

I find it very useful during maket ranging as the BARs will be cluster at the price for long period of time. During that period, I will stay away as market is choppy and don't want to spend whole day staring at the monitor.

for scanning purposes, range Bar will easily identify which pairs moves aggresively which we can use to our advantage to make quick hit and run.

Try it out...( better for you to ask Kevin permission first as not to pollute his trading system)

Love & Hugs

Miss Cute

Excellent work

Text book trades.... and a super clean chart on top of that.That is well organized and a really smooth setup you got there.

You can do that everyday Miss Cute.I hit 185 pips today and would have gotten more if I didnt have to explain it every ten minutes. Start about 2 or 3 am est and you will have market momentum on your side.

I trade all day and night because its just extra money and I am a workaholic.Stick to the hot market hours which are UK and US session and keep the money coming in.

Your posts are welcome here anytime.

hey, you are correct.usd/chf going down.

i have a question, so we don't need to look at H1 stoch? just take a trade that in H4 side(i mean H4 red, then we just looking for a short trade)?

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Hi,

ther is only two (2) additional items I add/modified to the Kevin's original template.

1. THV4 TzPivotsD(Black) , this serves as pivot point, opening prices and Yesterday High/Low. Note : Prices will react to Pivot, S&R. As you can observe in my previous Chart EUR/USD react to S2 (it has become quadreple bottom ) Therefore, it safe to go for Long there.

-tested 4 times and couldn't break south.

2. I change to standard 5 mins candle to 8 pips Range Bar for better visual.

I can share you the template and indi but please ask Kevin permission.

Love

Miss Cute

Hello Kevin,

only quick question. You are talking about live trades and post these live trades on demo account as you can see below. Perhaps i am wrong. Answer or just ignore this question...

BTW very interesting system! Thank you for sharing

Kindly regards

My earlier trade closed +4

Market has not moved south much,gave it some time but bailed now.

Will wait for next MOM north which may happen soon..

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Hi Adji,

not quite, the system is based on 2 types of entry

MOM trades, this is based of the 4hr stoch, and is when the stoch is one way (eg down) and the price has retraced to the upper band, in such a case you take the first valid RF bar for short.

In such cases the hourly doesnt really matter as it is probably going the opposite way anyway because of the retracement, however at some point the hourly stoch should come back into line with your 4hr stoch.

the other entry is the short term trades (ie. band to band), in these trades the hourly stoch is important.

ideally for these trades you are looking to trade in the direction of the hourly stoch on the first RF bar from the opposite band - the closer you are to the target band the riskier the trade.

so example, Hourly stoch is long, you would be looking to enter a buy trade on the first RF bar for long that is close to the lower band, with an aim to take profit close to the upper band, which is why the closer you can enter to the lower band the safer your trade.

of course you could be in a short term trade (band to band) and then the 4hr stoch comes into line, in which case your short term trade has turned into a MOM trade (this is what happened with my USDCHF trade from earlier)

Hopefully this answers your question.

Regards, John

Prices have tendecy to react at Pivot, S & R Level. I notice price touches 3 times just below S2 and couldn't break it. ( assuming buying picking up cheap prices)

At point No. 3, I didn't buy yet, as the one hrs Stocs has not changes momentum upwards, patiently waiting for another pull back at point No. 4 for clearer entry.

Noted that the 4 hrs stocs level is higher than the previous, even tough price getting lower ( Divergence).

TrendCCE Red Histo is getting shorter, even tough price keep touching the same bottom (another divergence)

Finally, the TMA Band is pointing 2:00 o'clock. (upwards)

My target for TP is around S1 or when prices touches TMA and reverse (move inside the band).

This is the easiest entry I ever had. Invest bit time to observe how Kevin's system works, keep it simple, wait for valid set-up, clean entry and bank in your pips.

Just like Kevin said " a text Book" set-up and entry.

Thank You Kevin.

Love & Hugs

Miss Cute

USDCAD - short MOM trade (4hr down, 1hr currently up)

Trading Plan:- If 1hr remains up then I will close near to the bottom band, if 1hr comes into agreement then MOM trade is on

EDIT: didn't watch and forgot to remove my TP, so unable to trade as a MOM but +29.3 Pips banked

I got out of that same Gbpusd trade with about 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Then I entered the next gbpusd trade that was right around the corner and

now up 40pips on hold looking for more.Total of 225 pips for the day as of

now.Even if I would have lost 1 mom setup which I have not as of now it

would not be a problem.In fact typing on here I have missed many trades like

the Audusd trade.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Your right on track and if you had taken that chfjpy buy you would be up 25 right now.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Same thing with the sell of usdchf.You spotted the setup and if you would have executed you would be up 35.

Both of those trades would have yielded 60 pips.Good end of US session trades.That is what you would have called a good day in the past.You trade with us and it is just a light snack.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
I have been evaluating your system, Kevinator.  For most part it is profitable.  The entry setup is good.  However, it would still require  money management.  People here who have been complaining of their losses are the ones who don't know what to do if their trades go against them.  For example,  The stoch 240 min shows green. And so, he waits for the retracement to happen, and place a buy when the price hits the lower band.  BUT what that person have forgotten is that their is also a "break point", which is when the new trend will develop.  If that person doesn't have a plan on what to do if the market goes against him, he will always be the recipient of losses.   Your system + money management= profitable trades.

Thanks,

Well all I can say is my wife knows nothing about trading I showed her this system cause its easy to see and trade. She had trouble the very first day so I had to show her a few things she did wrong since then she has had to very profitable days and made up for her mistakes. Hopefully she can keep it up we will see.

Here is a quick ej long trade. Price came down to lower TMA line with 4hr Stoch in the up mode. Took the long for a quick 13 pips. Price got to the trend line and got out. Need to have a few more trades because I didn't trust that price was going to break the trend line and go to the upper TMA band which it did. Hindsight is great in trading but as long as I'm making positive pips I'll try not to get too greedy.

Hey everyone,  great thread.  thanks to kevin and all other for a great system.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
I am in on the AU long trade.  Its looking good

--- 帖子 #991 ---
This is what I was talking about.  It met the criteria to go Long.  Few minutes later the trend reverses.   Without proper money management, a trader will lose, or lose more.  Guys and gals, MINIMIZE your loss by planning what to do if the market goes against you.  Just be patient and recuperate in the next setups.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Is this a MOM trade?

--- 帖子 #993 ---
It reversed and took my stop loss of 10 pips

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Looks Good

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Your stop loss is a little too tight.  Try a little larger stop loss next time.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
The 1hr stocastics is still in sell mode so it would be bad to take a long trade. It would be good to concentrate on 1 hr stocastics for short term trades. Also the nearby peak and trough could be a good stoploss.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
syste looks good, but I read so little on SL you guys use, where do you set it, do you used a fixed SL. Please help me on this.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hi D If I may comment , all looked good except price did not close above tma bottom line . maybe delay entry till 5m bar closes to see where it ends up.

This is how I see it .... Kevinator pls comment if I am wrong.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
I wouldn't want to risk no more than 15 pips on a five minute chart.

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Once the position is taken on the RF, I trail the position with a stoploss above the 15 min supertrend nrp mtf line. This extends the gains made.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
I'm confused after reading difference opinion.

What I understand is (buy):

60 trade

H 1 stochastic must step up

240 trade

H 4 stochastic must step up

H 1 stochastic not necessary step up

Kevin is this correct?

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Then from now on I will work with the 1 hr stochastic and if the 4 hr stochastic is going in the same direction then it will be a perfect set up.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Dehyah,

The stocastic indicators are in live dynamic mode so the 1hour stocastics can change color in 12 bars it requires to complete the bar. Similarly the 4 hour bar requires 48 bars to complete and its dynamic throughout. I would suggest the nearest trough or peak as stoploss to protect capital. If u notice if u follow the rules u have more positive trades and less trades which go against.

Look how it performs once the trend is set in.

No... overbought and oversold areas do not automatically dictate that price is going to reverse.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Hi guys

first thanks for all the Info and for the thread starter for shared this System.

I have a question, I used the Alpari.uk Broker there now my H4 stoch change to the short Signal because the Brokertime is Europe Time 08:15 now.

at the IBfx Chart the H4 Stoch is still Long because that is GMT 06:15

what I have to follow.

thanks

and a good day

gu mom failed, only 18 pips max

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Did not fail.  If you looked at the pips available by the width of the TMA, the trade was a success.  There was only about an 18 pip spread between the high and the low of the TMA.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Money management is very important, otherwise you will end up blowing your account. Even with a good system like this you will have bad trades.

The art of trading is to minimize your losses and maximize your profits.

I use predifined scripts in Metatrader with set SL en TP. Works well and is very fast (1 click) to open and close a trade. You will never forget to put a SL because it's incorporated in the script.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Thats the problem of H4 , no-one can answer that, as they are always going to have different signals dependent on the broker server time

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
but a mom trade is supposed to be more than other side band?

totally different to my chart

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
+ 16 eurjpy

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
ok then we all have to follow the same brokertime, please the Thread Starter has to give us the advice.

or the other way we have to use a analog Stoch, to see which way is the Indicator go.

thanks in advance

good day

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Well said

Imagine this , you have RR at 1 1 , say 15 sl 15 tp

if you are going to use that 15SL you need to be confident that the winning trades will get you 15 tp at least cos if your winning entries are around 50 % your account will dissapear pewwwfff

Sounds common sense but its tempting to close those deal when you have say 10 pips , thats how they get you

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
can you please post a chart? i don´t see it

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
kev,

I see that you are 2 stoch. one 10,3,3 and the other 14,3,3.

why?

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Trade did hit the other side of the band.  And MOM trades are not suppose to be anything but what has been stated.  Nowhere does it state that the MOM trade is supposed to rocket through the other side of the band.  I believe that Kevinator simply spoke of the energy behind these types of setups... not so much as an absolute defined behavior on the other end.  Remember... this is a high probability setup.  It's not going to be oerfect every time.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
You see this is not possible

I have two live accounts with two different brokers and different server times so my indie stoch 4h will be different for each

I will not change brokers just for the sake of a system  so it is like the thread starters time

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Broker Times:-

I do not know why but I see a similar discussion in almost every thread I read nowadays regarding broker times & the differences.

In a system such as this which is not premised on placing an order at an exact time, but rather based on a combination of various technical indicators, broker time makes absolutely NO difference.

The system here is based on various technical indicators coming together to give a possible trade, it really doesn't care if your broker time is GMT, EST or the time on the moon (not really sure what timezone they have!).

The only differences will be that someone may get a signal that you don't get because of the broker time, that's OK, other times you will get signals they don't get.

In the end you can ONLY trade the signals provided by YOUR broker.

Incidentally, it is important to note, that even if you are on the same broker time as someone else but with a different broker, the signals will also be slightly different, as all feeds are broker based, not centralized.

I have two different brokerage accounts, both on GMT, one uses MT4 and the other JForex, even a simple thing like MA has slight differences.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
sorry John, but that is the problem, if I see 2 hours a down signal and other people see an up signal that's not ok, if you will let people have same results and can posting trade setups, you have to give an Indicator that show on every Broker near the same Signal.

sure many Broker have different datafeed.

but looks like now Alpari.uk has from GMT 06:00 Stoch H4 down so we can have 1 mom Trade already and the next may now build, at IBFX you have from midnight and before only Stoch H4 up signal , so never can choose the Mom Trade if you follow the Rules.

there you can not say this will all average by the Time, if so then please show me some history, but I think only the Thread Starter can tell us he trade the System at what Broker time and it is successful.

hope we will have a solution for that

good day

Hi Takethat

Welcome to the wonderful world of Forex, until an organization such as the World Bank (I.B.S.) takes over control of the Forex market, this will always be the problem.

If you really want to have the same signals as the thread owner, then use his broker.

However as this is a thread and other people are posting from their own broker, someone might post a trade that you don't receive as a signal - does that mean their trade is invalid?

In addition, this (and other) forums has lots of different systems on it, posted by lots of different users, with different brokers - are you really going to open an account with every broker just to get the same signals as the thread owner?

As I stated at the beginning, these quirks exist due to the de-centralized nature of the market and will continue to do so, and there are only 3 solutions

a) accept it as part of the wonders of trading forex

b) open an account with every broker of the thread owner for the systems you use

c) switch to a more centralized method of investment (ie. stocks)

Regards

John

I fell asleep and just woke up.

I noticed two pages before that the member forexforex has posted a chart

and clearly tried to illustrate that he went long on the gbpusd wth all the

signals that matched and the trade went against him.

I too was in that trade and held it open to show you all something for the

sake of clarity.

It seems as everything was going great prior to 12am est.Right after 12as est

things changed and the trades went against them.If the risk is to great

them.I see no more posts by him since then and I thank him for waiting

all  day long for that one opportunity to show that a trade can go against you.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
The good news is that if you would have exited that trade there were two

more opportunities to reenter right around the corner which would have made

triple pips on all pairs.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
I will only have the  best Signal for this System, same the Author make the best results.

and btw I only charting at mt4 and trade by a Broker he don't have a real Mt4 Trading platform.

but the price will go the same way as at all brokers and if Kevinator make a +15 pip I will make +- 3 the same , so that is enough for me

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
After some time and the drawdown which you could have exited and reentered.Alll those trades are now in profit.

If I had stayed awake I would have reentered at (my chart time)4:15 on my chart and 7:15 both of those trades would have been profitable as they both followed the 4hr stoch.

And further more the top of the TMA would have given me a exit point for the trade prior to 12am est.

Needless to say everything is in profit now even the trades he was speaking on that took place prior to 12am,

Here is one...

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
I am up 50 pips in this trade please remember that number.

If I had exited with -20 I would have reentered and made 30 then reentered again and made 70. But 50 is ok so I am up 50 now.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Usdchf same thing.

I fell asleep and  am in the trade over 7hrs now.

The 4hr Mtf stoch remained down and so the trade did not go against me enough that I would have exited.

There were multiple entry points and I am up 50 more pips.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Same thing here........I fell asleep 7 hrs ago and took the trade based on the 4hr stoch.

Things "changed" at 12am est and it seems there was a drawdown.

I could have

1) exited and waited for a new reentry..Which would have made back double what I lost on the next setup.

2) trusted the signal and held the trade like I did based on the 4hr stoch which remained up.

I am up 30 pips on that trade.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Mind you now I have been asleep and if I were awake I would have exited those trades forexforex was so kind to illustrate and reentered and would be up 200+ pips for the day.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Hi Kevinator,

Could you pls share your latest tpl ?

thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
As of now I am up 130 pips in my sleep which I have seen traders struggle all day to get less.

I suppose I can go back to sleep now as my day should be done(but it is not).

I followed the signal via the 4stoch and although it did give me some draw which maybe was to severe to others.

No matter if I would have exited and reenter I would have made more pips anyway.

The point of all this?  Trading is like tennis....you do not have to win every match to win the daily set.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Questions and or comments?

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
That nice , but you have to tell us how much you risk and where is your SL , without that info it is for newbies dangerous to let a Trade open over the night and go sleep, and only your results today make it more dangerous , then some may will follow this without proper MM .

thanks

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
If you have been following the system in the last 6 hrs you have to have made more pips in the last 6hrs then you are used to making in a week.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Excellent trades kevin, it needs practice and lots of useful screentime.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
I think for those new to the system I would recommend starting at 12am est until you can learn to navigate the terrain a little better.

I understand that 20 pip drawdown to the next reentry point is a little extreme for some people so if you run into trouble just exit the trade and reenter at the next entry point which you would have made back 30+ about 35.

Then the previous move for 60 giving you about 90 minus the 20 you lost if you would have exited so 70 on the gbpusd.

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
If you trade this system next week from 12 am est to 12pm est and scan all the majors minus the usdjpy.Eurjpy and gbpjpy you can make 200 pips a day and 1000 pips a week.

I have had business appointment and been dealing with everyone elses issues.Online typing non stop and still managed about 225 yesterday and close to 200 everyday this week.

If I had been just relentlessly on a financial mission style pursuing these trades I would have 1200 or 1300 pips this week.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
If you follow the setups and learn to multitask.You can make 150+ pips everyday from week 1.

It takes momentum to drive these trades and what better time then to come to the largest daily group gathering which is UK and US session.

Anything after or before that is extra money for your account.

The bulk of your profits will come from these two sessions.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Kevin this system has been great. I fully agree with you that its the most profitable combination i have seen till now. Everyone is not the same some are critical on everything or they are not understanding something. Every system cant be always right u do have one or two bad trades due to your error also sometimes.

As far as i have noticed when you have an alignment of the  1 hr and the 4hour stocastics u can take a trade and sleep with the nearest trough or peak as stoploss.

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Here you go.........

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
That seems the case.Instead of thinking about trading on a trade by trade basis.Start to think about trading in terms of a session.

It takes experience in a system to gain trust in it.Although I am attempting to show you trades instead of just writing about them it still will take hours of experience to understand what or what not it is capable of.

It is like learning football playbook.

In the beginning you will have to follow the guide to complete the trade.After you see enough trades on the system you will be able to recognize the play as it is beginning just as someone familiar with football plays can recognize what plays are being played based on the player formation.

Kevin The third entry on the EURUSD was the safest and the correct entry as you had both 1hr and 4hour pointing up. The other two u had to be prepared for a stoploss. need not trade everything just do the trades where u have both stocastics in alignment.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Kevin,

you seemed to get upset with me last night when I was asking a genuine question about live trades, so we could learn. As you mentioned last night for me to go back and look at previous live trades you have taken, I could not find one that wasn't posted about 30 minutes after the trade was taken, and as you have mentioned the indicators are dynamic.

With post 983 the screenshot script, as you have offered to answer questions, could you please take me/us through a few live trades immediately when taken, what price entered, type of trade MOM or week 1 type and walk us through. I'm sure it will help alot for us aspiring kevinator's.

If you are unable to or don't want to I respect your thread as the owner and will not ask again.

Thanks for offer to answer questions. Good luck trading.

120 pips on that move total as of now.I am glad that you are starting to see good entry points that will take your trading to the next level.

Everyone has their own variation of the trading setup and template but the base theme remains the same.

Safety is a big priority.I am not so self centered to realize that there are traders trying to rebound their accounts and new traders trying to learn how to keep their hard earned.

I teach traders to keep moving.Keep the going and act on every 4hr setup that presents itself and I will continue to do so.I want traders to be able to handle each and every situation that presents itself.It is called breaking through your threshhold of pain by going out of your comfort zone which will only make you stronger.

I want traders to make profit from every setup that presents itself.That style will be good for you and if perfectly logical.Sometimes the market is not trending as beautifully as it is today and there are tougher waters to navigate.

During these tiimes I want traders to learn to make profits in even these harsh conditions.This is special forces training were at the end of the course a trader will be able to survive any situation that is thrown at them because they have seen and traded it all.There have been so may PMs from traders stating that they have traded more in the two days then in the last two weeks.

They are evolving into something else.So yes that is a valid point that will be taken into consideration.

240= 4hr stoch we look at that for overall trend direction.

For example purposes.We will say the 240 stoch is down,short,or selling.

Price within the TMA band is going down obviiously.

Price will pullback to the top of TMA when price is going down.

Then energy release in the direction of the trend.

The is called a MOM trade or MOMentum trade.

You must manage your own money as I do not know your broker,stop out level,margin requirements,leverage,or account balance.

I use a excel calculator to calculate these things so you must manage your own account.I am here to put you on more trade setups.

I feel the USDCHF is a good short setup.

did you trade real money? i see no SL and you fall asleep?

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
I love this trading system. This is what I have been looking for - 5m charts, simple system, enough trades to keep you busy and it has been working for me.

Thanks for sharing this system.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Yes its going slowly but sureley.

I hope you got in on the other trades this morning and if you did you should be up 100 or 200 by now on multiple pairs.

We have to do some closed group trading for some real money.I have been doing alot of typing and not enough trading this week although I still manage to pull up to 200 pips a day.

There is usually alot more out there everyday.With those that advance this part and really get it you may get a invite to private trading and we will get structured and start to monitor and stalk all pairs on shifts.

Boom there it is, the plan has srpung into action. The marketer strikes again.

This has been the whole plan from the start, suck you up, then cash in on his $$$$ per month private trading group.

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
I am glad you like it my friend.

It will take a few days to get used to trading the system as the most important lesson you will learn is patience.You will be able to sit and stalk a currency pair and wait for the proper setup.

It will be time consuming but well worth it.Think about this and imagine......there is a large trend going down on the 4 hr chart.

What we are doing is taking the surge of that trend all the way until it ends.We are entering when it pulls back.

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Thanks  for the template Kevin

I just miss that middle indi at the bottom on your template.

Could You provide me with that pls ?

Thanks again

And btw, those purple indi bars seem to show with a delay...

at least on my chart..they appear when i close and open mt4 station...

any solution to that?

Hi kev,

I am working full time in England but your system really has got me thinking that I might be able to do this full time, sometime in the future. First trade this morning a winner ( then off to work :-(.

Great job mate, looking forward to more of the same.

All the best,

Dave

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Rather than excludes newbies from the closed group you could set it up so they cant post , but they can observe ie Read only

That way they can learn how trades are found and executed, but trivial questions and comments are not cluttering up the group thread

Also this thread will die , which I feel will be a shame considering you are mentoring it so well

You can use the buddy system which allows posting by buddies only but still lets others observe

Everyone here is invited of course.I will keep the thread going but there must be a collective group of individuals that are all on the same page.Working for the same common goal.

I like fast forex's attitude.He said just exit out and wait for the next setup.

That next good trade is right around the corner.

That is how I think and is very positive.

He is starting to understand that the money is there and we are going to get.

Its just a matter of time.

the most important lesson you will learn is patience.You will be able to sit and stalk a currency pair and wait for the proper setup.

Hi Kevin and first of all thank you for sharing this system.

I have read from other threads the importance of patience when it comes to the waiting for signals, and I have read you mention this in this thread before, however it was not until now that I understand exactly what you mean by the above quote and in relation to the MOM trade.

So all I have to do now is practice stalking pairs and waiting for the right one.

Cheers and thanks

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
What I like about the system is that it trades on 5 min chart so you can easy take some pips when you have some time. I don't have the time to sit behind my screen all day so I definitely miss trades. The time I can spend it's really nice working with this 5 min system.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Thank you very very much!

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
I want your opinion on this trade i just took

Its base on 1HR stepping down

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Kevin, need your clarification here:

For 240 trade (Long example)

H 4 stochastic must step up

H 1 stochastic not necessary step up

Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
kester trade is correct its for small gains as the 4hr stoc is still up. It will pull back to the middle line of TMA.

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Yeah!

I took the same trade..scalp for 15pips
Attached Image

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Absolutely right. It's also hard for some people to take a loss. You have to understand that every system has defaults and will give bad trades. At that point, you must exit fast, take a small loss without thinking too much about it. And just wait for the next setup.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
Where do i get the TMA file and stoch? I download evreything in the 1 page but i didn't see them

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
1st page update version 2

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
I'm not sure what you mean... you went short on this one? Because if you did, that would be against the system rules... it's a pullback and that means wait for the next retracement upwards. Stochs are stepping up (ok, last one 60 is down but the global trend is up) so you only trade with the trend and go only long. Wait for this retracement to be finished and maybe the next retracement bar will give a long trade. Keep in mind that the price is circulating aroudn the upper TMA band, what in my opinion leaves not al lot of space for larger upwards movements... It would be better when the price is circulating between middle and upper TMA.

Is this analysis correct Kevin?

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
You can trade against the trend and take pips on the pullbacks but i think it's more risk than trading with the trend. Nevertheless, nice profit, well done :-)

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
I didnt stay in the trade at 12:30.  I'm new and didnt know if should of stayed in.  Now i see that it would have worked.  Thanks Kev

I took a couple of weeks of break from trading as I felt doing so. I also came by this thread by accident.  Read it, liked it the first moment I saw 'momo' approach.

P.S. Guys, is this some kind of a FF posting competition? I see some neverending huge posts appearing momentum.

Slow down for #$%^ sake.

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
Thank you!

Just look at 60 stoch...don't care about 240 stoch...

Price is at TMA opposition position

Thanks Kevin for great system

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
Listen sir

I will say to you one time and one time only.You just got back here and are new.

You need to show more respect to those that are here engaged in the work of trading the system.

You will not be disrespecting anyone here so do not even begin to go down that road.

We will post what we want to here and you have no say so otherwise.

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
Still i don't get the same picture as you do-why? (the update version 2 crush my metatrader)

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
I have to update the new system and template.It will be available on post 1 by saturday.

There have been indicator updates throughout the last 8 pages.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Make sure you are on the latest version of mt4. This should solve the crashing problem.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
I am not sure if i agree with this (such) signals although according to the rules of the system it is a valid one.. but some commonsense will do good here in such situations..

price is clearly bullish.. TM band is striking bullish.. 240 stoach stepping up like crazy..  when such upward move is obvious even to a 5 year old by just looking at the chart... it is not wise to take a short scalp trade just because 1hr stoch flashed stepped down in the first 5-10 minutes of the hour.. and RF signaling down..

at some point a trader must use some commonsense to evaluate the whole picture and reject and wait for better opportunities..

The reason i have froze this pic is to help out the new traders as i see lots of them in this thread.. the reverse side of this could get nasty when PA makes a quick turn and runs up fast to hit the SL on the other side in a heart bit most times.. and this could ruin the confidence of a newbies of this system... a experienced trader might be able to get away with this for a small loss, but a experienced trader most likely will not get involved in such trade, I have no doubt.  its too risky because its simply going off on well premature PA reversal trade.

such trades must be taken on more of a slower days and not trending time of PA especially when it's still peaking..  more settled bands or days.. the trade on the first flash of the 1hr stoach is totally fine..   this must be recognized by a trader... and believe me you will not miss out on opportunities.. by god there are so many more right around the corner that you can take advantage of a bit wiser off more matured PA situation.

I only made this post out of care folks.. you can reject it or you can keep it in the back of your mind.. it's a free world brothers.

I think Kevin will concur with me on this one.. if not.. Kevin just let me know and I will erase this post on a flash.

happy piping to all.

I have to step out for about two hours and will be back.

I am going to close my current usdchf trade with profit simply because I cannot monitor it now and I am sure there will be another set around the corner when I return.

I am sure it will hit the bottom TMA over time.

You guys know the setup and keep moving forward.

Im up 140 pips no problem.

PDean,

Thanks for advise, i have took this trade because i saw 60 stoch overbought and also it fullfill Kevin's 60 rule right?

Or i miss out something?

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
Good luck  I think this system is the best ever (hope i'm not worng)

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
in Metatrader,  Help then About will tell you your current build of MT4

normally Live Update should start if applicable when starting MT4, it depends on your broker

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
No your not missing out my friend... its according to the rules as even said it in my post... but it's just one of the riskiest one and its wise to reject such signals till one gets the hang of things and overall I myself personally reject and scan this type of signals.. there are much much better ones right around the corner in no time..  that's all.

confidence is key in trading.. let's build that first by more solid setups.. get some winner under your belts and than let lose...  if you make +170 on a half day and then who care if you take couple of riskier shots and lose.. big deal... but now since you all are new but pumped and excited about this prolific system.. let's keep that momentum up and not scratch that by such riskier setups.. this is the Nuts of my point... it's all mental boys and girls.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
2009 version- the only time i needed to update was when i just install and run for the first time

P.S: Someone can upload The 1hr stocastics?

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Hi Android38

the trade is perfectly valid by the rules.

P.Dean was mentioning that although the trade is valid by the rules, sometimes there are times when it is best not to take these scalp trades.

For me personally I look at the angle of the TMA bands, if they are not too much of an angle then I take the trade, if the angle is clearly bullish and a bearish scalp is indicated then i don't bother with it, but that is my own interpretation

having said that I probably miss quite a few good setups, but there are plenty of trading opportunities every day for me not to worry about missing a few.

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
that is not the version, you need to provide the build id

for example "Version 4.00 Build 402"

in some cases indicators that were originally compiled on a later build will not work on a previous build, in such cases you should

delete the indicator with the .EX4 suffix ONLY if you have the indicator with the .MQ4 suffix, Metatrader will then automatically rebuild it for you

For the one hour stochastics, click on the paperlip, select hide images, then download the !Kevinator or !Kevinator v1 indicator (either the MQ4 or the EX4)

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
That's it John... in less words but beautifully said.

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Yes i have version 4.00 Build 226- i need to update?

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
Hi P.Dean,

it was nice Info, but you see the market is unpredictable.

and any time you think you will be wrong.

the System must have the odds on your side then you have to Trade same a robot.

only what you can manage is the money you bed on the market and if the System has a good win ratio then it will be profitable.

But I miss here a lot of info same other experience Trader already ask for.

Kevinator has to give a guide for his System, no say I don't know your account and ....

give a sample account $5000  how many can risk, SL TP and so one, must a complete guide.

in the moment it is incomplete to let a newbie trading this System.

but all the best and hope it will a good complied Guide to help people can make $$$ in the future

all the best to the Kevinator trading group

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
yes you need Build 402 is the new one, some windows 7 computer has prob to let you update, because of the right to change , admin rights!

check it out

cheers

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
You miss the whole point of my post.

Have good weekend everyone, I am out.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
first of all find out which is causing you the problem

there are only max 4 indicators to add

retracement finder

!kevinator or !kevinator v1

TMA or TMA with Distance

#MT Trendline (optional)

then try the solutions I mentioned before updating your MT4

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Thanks jmw & Dean for valuable advise..

I'm just testing this system..so i'll take all risky and momentum trade...after that i will analyst the result and learn from it before i go for live trade.

you know why I member of this ff long time but post only a little, because that is some like a kinder garden here.

but I try to help.

please read my posting careful and you will agree, because you give advice to stay out for newbies and check something, but all five major pairs for this system make >15 pips.

is that not all what you want at scalp again the trend? why not clarify the system then you will have success.

that was all for what I ask, make a good manual for guide.

that's my 2 cents here

cheers

BTW, I read the whole Thread, many questions will be has answer already in the Thread, Newbies please read the whole Thread that will help you a lot!

Trading is hard work, if you not read already the Thread you will not success !!

Tal1983 Post #1126

The !Kevinator V1 will give you both the hour and 4 hour stochasic with the Up / Down in the same window.

If you want just the one indicator, download the Color Stochastic v[1].04(1)

Is this MOM?

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Tht's the problem-i can see only 4h stoc

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Maybe, but very weak. two greens on stoch, bottom of bands

but as John said...

risky, eh with that persistent down trend

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
post a screen shot, maybe then I can help

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Got stopped out for 11 pips.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Tal1983

If you have downloaded the Color Stochastic, you can change the "timeFrame" under the Inputs tab to 60. This will give you the 1 hour stochastic.

You can download the indicator again into the same window and have the "timeFrame" set to 240 for the 4 hour stochastic.

Make sure the you remove the tick for Fixed minimum and Fixed maximum on the Common tab of the indicator.

I'm not able to explain how you only show the 4 hour stochastic if you downloaded the !Kevinator v1 indicator as that automatically loads with both stochastics.

Di

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Now i have the 1h stoch but not the 4h-what is the problem?

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
Tal1983

They are both there in the same window. The 60 min one is the yellow/red/blue one and is the thicker of the two.

The 4 hour one is immediately underneath and you can see the Sea Green colour and the blue step riser. It is set to a 2 thickness whereas the other is set to a thickness of 4.

I admit to changing the color and thickness of my 4 hour stochastic.

Di

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Thank you! finally i have the 1h and the 4h together-is something missing or it's o.k?

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Tal1983

You haven't downloaded the TMA that appears in the top window with the prices.

Di

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
I can see both stochs quite clearly in your chart,

the one that is yellow with flashes of blue & red is the 1hr (the upper line)

the one that is sea green with flashes of blue & red is the 4 hr (the lower line)

you can also hover your mouse over the lines and it will show you what each line is.

In addition the bottom stoch window you have for 4hr is not needed when using the !kevinator indicators.

As someone also mentioned you are missing the TMA indicator on your chart (either TMA.ex4 or TMA with Distance.ex4)

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
I download and put them but from some reason they don't show up-can you upload the file?

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
Hi Dehyah

that was a valid signal

BUT

price had been clearly in a downtrend

4hr stoch had only changed to long within the 4hr period

The name of this thread is Kevinator 5m retracement

the operative word being retracement

while sometimes you may be lucky and catch the start of a new trend, more often you wont

P.Dean and myself have mentioned this, just because there is a valid signal doesn't mean you should necessarily take it

Kevinator has mentioned this is like a "football play book", you need to have studied the reactions in real time and in time you will be able to automatically discard the weaker signals

Don't worry this is a learning curve, but very quickly overcome, in the beginning I also was taking signals left right & centre, now I am more selective.

Keep on with it though, this is a two part process

1) recognizing the signals

2) recognizing the stronger/weaker signals

Nice work!

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
For those that are having a hard time visualizing what exactly we are doing with the MOM trades,

We are taking the large parts of the major trend.

If you see I have marked the 4hr chart to show the major trend.

This is the major trend your 240 or 4hr mtf stoch will show.

If you see the market surges up then,  pulls back , then resumes.

We are taking that surge in the trend and when price pulls back it pulls back to the top or bottom of the TMA.

Does this make sense to everyone and do you understand what we are doing?

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
Alright everyone this concludes our week of trading as it is past 12pm est on friday and everyone that has enough money to drive trades is off doing what we all should be doing right now.

On the phone with your broker telling him or her to send the check from this weeks proceeds.

Alot of people would say thank you kevin for telling us about your trading system.

I say do not thank me...you should thank Jesus Christ of Nazareth because without him I would not be here to tell you of these things,

So thank him as he gets all the honor and the glory.

See you Monday morning 12 am est for more work and have a good and safe weekend.

Hi

No trading for me today as i have had other business to take care of.

See that you have had another fantastic day

My AU trade from yesterday(1/3 position which i let run) closed out at break-even...still had a good week tho..

Thanks to kevin for the system and continued support.

Also like to thank all the other major contributers to this thread(too many to mention,you know who you are) who have found success with this system and helped others in their own way

Have a great weekend ALL.

See you all next week.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Ok so the thread has matured some what. I was wondering if we should open up a chat room on skype or something so we can discuss things in realtime. I don't know if Kevin is interested, although I did PM you  What do you reckon?

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
I wanted to suggest that too-hope he will agree. I took now 20 pips 1hr before the close (i never trade in friday night) this is the first time thanks to the system!

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
In my experience opening chat rooms trends to be counter productive. No matter how well the methodology is defined everyone wants to use their own modifications and this leads to mass confusion, especially with the newbies. After about 3-4 weeks of in fighting amongst the group most people will lose interest, move on and the chat room dies. I've been trading for a long time now and I've been involved in a few chat rooms and this happens in almost every room I've got involved with. Even if you have a strong leader like Kevin, he can't be in the room 24/7 to keep people on track. Even if he could I would imagine he wouldn't want to be in the room 24/7 otherwise his trading account would suffer.

Again, just my two cents worth.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
Kevin,

I believe its the Grace of Jesus and the wisdom that the Holy Spirit has given you to share and learn what you have taught these guys here...

I pray that my trades will start to really become more successful after reading the inspiring things here.

Stay blessed, and I pray God blesses you and uses you more then he already has. Great stuff bro.

I'm doing back test on EURUSD for this system.

Blue vertical line is MOM trade

Red vertical line is scalper trade

1 lose out of 15 trade = 93% of profitable % with 7% drawdown

Total 405 pips green pips on 1.5 days times

Wow!!! Amazing right?

So far the most profitable and consistent manual system in FF trade so far

Try out your own back test on difference pair.

Need Kevin's comment on red and blue line that i draw..is it follow the correct rules?

Hi Dave1, I would execute the trade on the trigger of the lead Magenta bar. Thats the most important bar after the setup is formed. Most of the time when setup is clear u can have the nearest trough or peak as stoploss.

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
aries2103, thank you.

Do you have any questions about any of the trading material?

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Hi Kevin,

Do you have any tips or advise on determining reversals in the trend other than waiting for the 4hr stoch to change from one colour to the other?

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
I do regarding other trading strategies which you are not familiar with but I do not regarding the current system which we are focusing on.We take our signals from the 4hr stoch.

Is that not good enough for you? I am interested in your concern and would like to know why you are warning other traders of something.

I noticed that on your previous post there was a warning in the title and would like to know specifically what you are talking about?

Also are you and do you know paulus which I previously banished from this thread and are you and he communicating via pm?

Kevin this method almost catch all the pips in fx market..

60 trade catch high risk short term trend

240 trade catch low risk long term trend

both combined with 60 & 240 on same direction is lowest risk with highest profit.

SL is hard to set because we are using low tf maybe set fix value at 20-30pips...

TP is next TMA line with trailing if more pips wanna catch.

One question, do you trade 240 with 60 in difference direction, just follow 240 direction and ignore 60 direction?

Hi Kevin, thanks for your system and help.

Please, when do you exit of the trade? Which are the conditions to exit of the trade?

Thanks for you help and happy weekend for all.

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Kevin,

Pls help to check my post on #1169..

Is that all correct?

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
When people finally realize the true potential of what we are talking about it is like a light goes off in your head and you understand.

This is the moment of enlightenment.

You understand that you can make a few hundred pips a day trading this system.

That chart you posted is one pair.Imagine when you can manage all the majors minus the usdjpy as that is like watching molasses pour out of a jar.

The others give good movement.

The only advice I would give you is begin work at 12am est and end when you no longer want to trade.Go no farther than 4pm est that is the end of the day.

You should pull 1000 a week if you trade that way.That big market move you always used to miss.You will get it everyday now.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
Unfortunately i'm not yet a full time trader...

I only have 2-3 trading hour per day.

I usually trade on US open session.

Hopefully it can consistently give me 30pips per day

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
30 pips a day?.......Try 300 to the focused.I made 175 half sleep and took those last trades of the day (which I should have closed before the market closed) and thats another 40+ pips.

So 215 pips today and all the trades are posted on the last 10 or so pages.

I missed many trades which would have taken me to 3 or 400 just as you predicted.Your right one key android.

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
I will say this...For the best results use the system from 12am est to 4pm est for mom trades .After those hours 60m stoch trades for short pips.

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Any questions,

if you need me to walk you through something now is the time to ask.

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Yeah, i've asked many time with same question..but you haven answer me yet.

for 60 trade we just look at PA at TMA & 60 stoch only right? Not care about 240 stoch right?

For 240 trade we only care bout PA at TMA & 240 stoch only right? Not care about 60 stoch right?

If 60 & 240 stoch in the same direction then it is bonus or looking for great profit.

Hope u can clear this up.

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
Can I ask if you can find time to make an update on page 1

There have been some new updated indikators lately

and it would be a help for me to know

what we use now

thanks in advance.

Peter

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
That is exactly right....You understand what we are doing and how to execute the trades.

I like the fact that you can forsee the potential of the daily yield.In fact you have it marked out.

It will be exhausting to keep the pace for 24hrs so Just start at 12am est and end at 4pm est and you will be just fine.

If you stick with this program for two months you will be in another tax bracket.This is literally the keys to the bank vault that everyone has tried to unlock but could not.

It is one thing to understand the trading system.But it is another to forsee that you have the potential to execute the strategy and make a few hundred pips a day.

There are people that will be very,very happy with the pips we make in a day for them to make in a month.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
I have to get with John to for the newest versions and any code fixes which I will post on first entry.I could give you what I have but I would like him to RAR it and post so it will be maybe tomorrow but by sunday open and I will remember to send you a PM.

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
Hi

Thanks Kevinator

that make sence to me.

So I will watch for when you and John fixed that.

Peter

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
Thanks you for clearing my doubt..

At the moment i only have limited time to trade with.

Hopefully it will gain my confidence and soon become full time trader:-)

How long have you trading with this system?

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
I've heard that people were having trouble backtesting. Are we able to backtest with the current indicators as they are?

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
HI Kevinator!In MOM trades you enter with reverse of RF or with touch of TMA?thanks.

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
Hello Art

MOM=MOMentum

We first look at the 240 stoch for trend direction.

In this case the trend is up (4hr trend).

Within the TMA band price is moving upward.

We wait until price pulls back to the bottom TMA band and enter Long.

Exit is at the top of TMA or if you get a large spike and the market looks like it is going to keep going hold it.You may have the lowest price of a big move!

Vice versa for a short.Do you understand this.

I would begin trade at 12am est and end trade at 4pm est trading all the majors except usdjpy including eurjpy.

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
Just scroll back a few months and test it manually to see the price action.

I am recommending you trade between the hours of 12amest and 4pm est.I am not responsible for results otherwise as there is a lack of proper liquidity to carry our trades through.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
but you wait fo signal of RF or only pullback to bottom of TMA for entry?thanks

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
For me sometimes I take the entry as price hits the outside of the band but correct entry is with rf finder.Once you do enough of the trades you will say to your self.I already know what is going to happen so I am entering outside of the band.

That approach will get you into trouble sometimes especially when there is a big move the drawdown can be up to 40 pips but if you would have waited for the rf finder you would have perfect entry.

So for now use the rf finder for entry.....when you get 15 or 20 trades under your belt you will see what makes the most sense...outside TMA band entry.

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
Here is another......

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
Any more question,comments,concerns?

I am here and this is the time to ask.No question is wrong or to small to ask.

--- 帖子 #1196 ---
Morning Kevin

first of all a big thank you for all your work here, i have the original indicators on my chart, can you tell me where to find your updated as you show on your latest chart here,

god blees you

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
Hi Kevin,

Want to thank you first for this great system you have created and for helping the traders that really need help in their trading ( me included ).

It is a system that is not stressfull, very profitable and enjoyable, and as you say it IS possible to make 1000 pips per week.

Just one question I would like you to clear up for me is that when we are in a MOM trade and the the 60 and 240 stoch are one way, then the on the next step of the 60 stoch the step starts to flash colours (blue/red) then goes oposite to the 240 stoch do we still count this as MOM trade and wait for it to change into the same direction or do we now count this as a short trade and use a smaller tp say centre of TMA.

Hope you understand my question Kevin.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
Here is the update

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
Actually the MOM trade is off the 240 only.If you get the 60 and the 240 match you will get a big move.But I just trade the 240 and disregard the 60.

60 is for short term scalp trades taken off the rf finder.The bulk of your daily money is MOM and the rest is extra money from the 60.

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
Thankyou for clearing that up kevin.

Roll on Monday

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
thanks for zip - TMA with distances wouldn't compile proerly for me. It was showing some errors

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
Excellent,

Trade the 240 MOM from 12amest to 4pm est.I recommend the sixty the same hours but...You can trade it all day if you trade the right pairs.

Well what are the right pairs? During the 240 hours trade majors and eurjjpy..no usdjpy it is like watching molasses drip out of a jar.

60m pairs are audusd and eurjpy for now other pairs when you get acclimated.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
I have to get with john for the official updates and will post them on the first page later.

That is what is on my desktop as of now.If you really want the indicator just search for it on the top of the page for the original dwnload post.

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
Thats it I am going to sleep see you on monday.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Hi Again

I uploaded your update.

I have 2 quistions about it, hope you can help

I see that now you use TMA at 50.

some post back you said that 45 could be used?

So do you now recommend us to use 50.?

And I also see that you have TMA called up on chart.

As I recall what John say about that.

It was an indikator we just have in indikator folder but not on charts.

Sorry for being a pain in ass, but I just want clear this up so I am on the same page as you

Peter

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Kevin, what about this "simple and stupid" chart, based only on 240stoch?

Can it be real trades or it just "history painted"?

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
you might be fairly early in on your journey but you will realise that backtesting visually is a complete waste of time.

stuff repaints and your eye will not tell you what actually happened by looking at the past.

the biggest error is your calculation of pips. you have calculated pips on offer. not what you would have made.

what exit method would you have employed? without any errors you would be lucky to have gained half of that, if you put in the human error with manual trading on top you are looking at a quarter.

trade it in demo for 3 months then post back and see if you got your 405 pips.

unfortunately the picture isnt as rosy as one thought with this utter mindfuck of an expensive hobby.

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
Does it include the TMA? From some reason I can't see TMA

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
I downloaded it but still it doesn't shows up- I don't know what to do

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
Hi

I think we use the indocator called TMA with distance

And this is in the update

Peter

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
Hi Tal1983

unfortunately I cannot help you unless you provide detailed information as to what is happening.

I am not sure of your level of technical expertise with Metatrader, so it is not so easy.

If an indicator (and this is any indicator) does not load there are 2 tabs in the Terminal section of metatrader that can help you,

one is titled "Experts" the other "Journal", you should look at these tabs and when specifying a problem list any messages that are associated with the indicator you are trying to load.

Alternatively we could use the chat facility at http://chat.efnet.org:9090/ (enter a user name, specify #Kevinator as the channel) and I could walk you through it.

IMPORTANT:- The above chat is only for technical problems with indicators and difficulties in getting the charts correctly setup. NOT the actual method.

Then the thread wont get cluttered with inane technical queries.

Regards

John

Hi All

below is a transcript of a chat I just had with another member who was experiencing problems using the templates, in a few minutes he had a working template - you can follow along if you are having problems

[13:44] <@jmw1970> get a clean 5m chart

[13:44] <@jmw1970> press CTRL G to remove the grid

[13:44] <winwinlos> ok done

[13:45] <@jmw1970> and change to custom indis

[13:46] <@jmw1970> will add the TMA first, either choose TMA or TMA with distances and drag it onto the chart

[13:47] <@jmw1970> let me know when done

[13:48] <@jmw1970> you still there???

[13:49] <winwinlos> yes

[13:51] <winwinlos> kevinator 3.tpl is not working properly

[13:51] <@jmw1970> settings can be 56,50 or 45 - it depends on your risk appettite

[13:51] <winwinlos> ok i like 56

[13:51] <winwinlos> 45 is very agressive

[13:51] <winwinlos> :-)

[13:51] <@jmw1970> so now you have TMA with 56

[13:51] <winwinlos> yes

[13:52] <@jmw1970> ok find the Retracement Finder indicator and drag that onto the chart

[13:52] <@jmw1970> let me know when done

[13:52] <winwinlos> done

[13:53] <winwinlos> cci set to 8

[13:53] <@jmw1970> good, now drag the !Kevinator indi onto the chart

[13:53] <@jmw1970> you do not need to change any settings if using TMA 56

[13:53] <winwinlos> ok done

[13:53] <winwinlos> nice :-)

[13:54] <@jmw1970> are you using the MT Trendline, if so drag that onto the chart

[13:54] <winwinlos> ok

[13:54] <winwinlos> yes i use

[13:54] <@jmw1970> when all is done you should have a completed chart,

[13:54] <@jmw1970> now go to Charts | Templates

[13:55] <@jmw1970> Choose save and give it a name

[13:55] <@jmw1970> then you have your own template

[13:55] <winwinlos> ok i will save it as .tpl

[13:55] <winwinlos> ok done

[13:55] <winwinlos> sometimes i have very load cpu

[13:55] <@jmw1970> now open a new chart, switch to 5m and add the template you created

[13:55] <@jmw1970> new chart should come up correctly

[13:55] <winwinlos> ok done

[13:55] <winwinlos> thank you

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
Thanks very good explanation.

Can I ask you in Kevinator V1 indikator

we can adjust TMA according to what we use

45/50/56

But how do it influense on the kevinatorv1 indikator.?

thanks

Peter

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
Hi Fratelli

in the settings of the Kevinator indicator is a parameter

xi_TMA

you set this to be the same period as your TMA, default is 56, but if you change your TMA on screen you must change it here as well.

Note the same applies to the CCI, there is a parameter xi_CCI which should be at the same settings as your retracement finder.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
The indicator are repaint but if you really understand what is the reason made it repaint and how you deal with it.

This system is not using just one indicator to confirm trade, repaint indicator need other lagging indi to confirm before trade.

Yes the back test shown 405pips is just based on visualization but in real life if we can get 100pips per day isn't that great?

I'm not selling this system here...no need 3mths backtest and report it back to you...

The system is here...if you like it just take it, if the repaint indi not suit you just leave it and search for better system that suit you more.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
Even though the TMA or stoch might repaint from time to time, it is not too much to offset a trade.  From my experience with dealing with the system I have noticed that most of the trades you posted will be very very good trades in real time.  So I think the 405 pips are very possible to make, you gonna need to be there to watch.... may be.

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
John please look at post #1140 for print screen I made shows you exactly what i have got from the kevinator1.tpl and what not. You see that TMA is missing (although I have TMA.mq4 in the experts->indicators directory)?    P.S: does the system works in news or should we need to trade before/after 1h from the news?

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
yes I can see you have it missing, so add it manually

follow the chat transcript on the previous page

if it doesnt add for whatever reason after following the transcript provide me with the detailed error messages

I have no problem helping you, however if you continue to give me such answers as "it doesn't work" without providing details I am unable to do so

In addition i would suggest that you do this sooner rather than later,

last week i missed a large amount of time which could of been trading dealing with technical issues

There will be updates to the indi's this weekend but next week I will be back concentrating on trading

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
Looking back on Friday for EU...I'm wondering how many people took this 240 MOM trade (vertical line on screenshot). It was good for 65 pips. This is a textbook setup for a long, isn't it?

I know the answer...no one. No one took this trade on Friday.

Does everyone understand why no one took this trade on Friday?

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
I didn't took it cause i didn't knew about this lovely system

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
I am getting very tired of you coming on this thread disrupting the forward progress.

You continue to push the same argument that we should use your indicator TMA true.

I entered the trade and closed it out and entered again.The screen shot is posted below.

If I would have used your indicator I would not be in these extra trades.

I have taken alot of time to consider these things.

I have laid out a strategy and system with indicators already.

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
I trade only when price is outside TMA channel and other indicators match.

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
You gave us a good strategy and people are still lazy to read.

BTW Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
Let me have a stab

TMA would have been in the upper band and 1H stoch going down

BUT I did get in the trade much earlier on and thanks to this system

see the first  line

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
Yeah I know,

I got in late here and the trade still worked out.I was answering emails at the time.

Correct entry is outside the TMA for the experienced and with the Rf signal for the new traders until you get 15 trades then you will get it.

He keeps trying to get me to change the system around and it already works fine.

He is on his last leg.I listen to suggestions and will explain the strategy to a new trader 100 times a day with a smile.But when one of the old FF members come to this thread and fully understand what I am doing and still try to disrupt our progress....well he is on his last leg here.

New traders me and the others stand behind you 100% and there is no question we will not answer so if you are curious just ask and we will do our best to answer it.

To the old members bitter of our success..we will deal with you accordingly.

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
Is it really disruptive? It is a simple question and it is a Saturday. You instructed everyone to check back through the charts to see how profitable this system is. I did that. I saw a trade on Friday that looks perfect. So I posted a question about it. What's the problem with that?

I am certainly NOT pushing for you to use the TMATrue indicator. I did not even mention the TMATrue indicator in my previous post.

So, that I am clear. You are saying that on Friday @ around 8:30 AM EDT, you noticed PA hitting the lower line of the TMA. You saw that the H4 Stoch was stepping up. You then waited for the Retracement Finder to indicate a long trade. At that time your criteria for a 240 MOM trade was met, so you entered long. Do I have this correct?

Edit: Oops, pushed the wrong buttons and got banned. As the thread creator, that is certainly within your rights to do so. Normally, I would delete my previous posts at this time, but I think I will leave them here in the hopes that some of the newbies will understand what exactly I am saying. It is obvious that peterporter and a few others understand.

And no kevinator, I was never trying to get you to change your strategy and/or indicators. I wish you much success with your system and a long and prosperous career in forex trading.

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
Wow.  I am so happy that I ran across this thread.  The help people have shown here has been tremendous - thanks for that, its inspiring.  Kevin, thanks for all of your dedication and willingness to teach people.  Glad I'm here and learning!  John, big props to you also.

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
peterporter,

I was looking at this as a potential 240 MOM trade, so the H1 stoch was not a factor.

But yes, your reasoning is exactly why the trade in my original question was not actually a valid trade at all. Thanks for taking the time to answer my question, providing a screenshot and nice explanation of your reasoning.

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
You listen to me sir

Do not disrespect or challenge peter.

I think you are done here.

You are sneaky with your nasty comments and slip them in causing doubt or confusion with the new traders.

We have taken live trades.

We have posted chart after chart after chart.

If you were a new trader I would have patience but you fully know what we are talking about and still disregard and disrespect us here.

With your "why did no one take those trades" rhetoric.

We took those trades closed them and got more.

I am done wrestling with you and these are the reasons what happened to you happened to you.

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
Now i'm confused the 4h stoch didn't point on buying? I mean the 4h more important then the 1h doesn't he?

--- 帖子 #1231 ---
Hi Kev,

You are genuinely trying to help others to make a success of your strategy, with your positive vibes and willingness to listen and guide others towards success, I am glad that you intend not to allow this method/thread to be cluttered with unecassary indicators/improvements which will serve to confuse.

The method you have given us is ok as it is, as you have proven.

Keep up the good work.

All the best,

Dave

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
Hello

Do not be confused.What we are doing here is simple.

MOM=Momentum

We look to the 240 stoch which is the 4hr for overall trend direction.

We are trading the 5m chart with the majors minus usdjpy.We also trade eurjpy and sometimes gbpjpy.

If the 4hr stoch is going up we then look into the TMA channel.

Price should be going in the direction of the 4hr stoch.

When price pulls back to the lower channel we will enter a trade going in the direction of the 4hr trend.

So we are buying or selling pullbacks.Then a release of energy in the direction of the trend.

Exit is the top of the TMA...unless you get a good enough surge that you think price will continue then we will hold the trade and let it run.

If the 4hr stoch is in one direction we should get a good move.If the 4hr and the 1hr stoch match then we get a great move.

Primarily we are looking at the 4hr though.

Your first time trading use the retrace finder indi to enter in the direction of the 4hr stoch once it has bounced off the TMA.

If you have taken trades with us before just enter when price crosses the line as we know it will then continue in the direction of the major trend.

Surge in the direction of the major trend,..............pulll back (entry) to the opposite TMA............energy release in the direction of the major trend.

Surge in the direction of the major trend,..............pulll back (entry)to  the opposite TMA............energy release in the direction of the major  trend.

Surge in the direction of the major trend,..............pulll back (entry)to  the opposite TMA............energy release in the direction of the major  trend.

You are taking the major parts of the 4hr trend as it moves in its path.

We use the pullbacks as entry points.

New traders us the rf finder as a trigger to enter.

After you get a few trades you enter at the line.

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
I found this thread earlier this week what a great system. I am yet to trade it though.  I had at look at the possible USD/CHF trades we could have taken using MOM approach. Here is a screenshot of what could have happened this week. I believe Kevin was trading these and confirmed they were in profit in his posts.I have commented and my interpretation of this part of the system is displayed.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
Many Thanks to Kevinator for this system, this is no attempt to change it in any way just want to share my rules that I will use and post the results on a live account.

hi all been looking at this system and posts now and here are the rules for this system that I will use next week. I will be trading live with 1 micro lot only.

1. use 4 hr stochastic as the trend guide.

2. wait for price to move outside or to extreme of TMA.

3. look for Retracement finder bar in direction of 4 hr stochastic.

4. sell a break of the low of this bar. (conservative entry).

5  Default stop loss 25 pips 50 pip trailing stop.

6. Close position if stochastic indicator closes with a opposite color or trailing stop is hit.

7. Only 1 loss allowed per session from 0:00 GMT to 0:00 GMT and only 1 win after that the dealing is over until next session- after 0:00 GMT.

Thats it stay tuned I will attempt to post each trade.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
Just did a really cool coin flip game it really helped my understand probabilities much better and positive expectancy and how random the market can be...

take a coin heads -25 tails you win +50 go thru 10 20 or more even flips and see what happens even with only 50 percent wins if they are double the loss your still ahead very interesting little experiment in randomness and the market paradox.

create positive expectancy.

Thank you very much!!

Thank you! Now everything just fine (i'v got the TMA also) after i downloaded kevin update 3

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
Hi all, first post- have been reading this thread over the weekend and just caught up to date.

Seems a very simple, common-sense approach to trading- one which I feel comfortable with. I will be giving it a real crack starting tomorrow and hope to keep learning through trial and error.

I appreciate all the effort that Kevin has gone to in making this system real.

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
I've been reading through the entire thread trying to fully understand all the nuances of this great system. Many thanks to all the helpful and informative input by Kevin and others!

I really hope someone could help to clarify some final questions I have after reading all the valuable info (and maybe misunderstanding something as a forex beginner?)

1. Should the Retracement finder's (RF) signal (proper magenta bar) always be used in all the entries (1h and 4H)? It is a bit confusing for a newbie like me to see some trade examples with trades taken without RF signal. What would be the exception for not using RF signal...experience with the system?

2. Still about RF. Should we take it's signal on close of proper magenta bar (5 min of waiting) or already as soon as it starts to form the right way? I've seen some controversiality in several screenshots. If taken only after magenta bar close, I've noticed that in many trades profitability decreases greatly.

3. I downloaded and inserted #MT TrendLine_2 indicator. Does it come with all the correct/proper settings automatically..so no need to adjust anything? Could someone please briefly explain it's basic function, signals and how to use it in this solid trading system?

Once again many thanks for this strategy and all the valuable input!

Good luck everyone!

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
Thanks Kevin for your valuable help and insight.

Looking forward to the next week of trading !

cheers

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
Dear All

following different requests here are the latest versions of the indicators

Kevin, perhaps you could upload them to the first page.

IMPORTANT: The default parameters ONLY need to be changed if you wish to use some of the more advanced settings used by more experienced users of this system.  Otherwise the defaults are perfectly valid.

!Kevinator v2

Updates/Modifications

Ability to send eMails for alerts has been added (this does require that you have configured the parameters in MT4 to use this facility)

The control to send Alerts/eMails has been removed at the chart level.  This is now controlled at the Metatrader level.  ie. Alerts/eMails will either be sent for ALL charts that the indicator is attached to or none.

The default is no Alerts/eMails - to switch On/Off press F3 for Global variables.  Search for !Kevinator Alerts (or eMail) and set to 1 for On, 0 for Off.

Period seperators if required will now be displayed in the indicator window, (Default is to display, can be changed in the parameters), the first time frame (ie. the 1hr normally) has a vertical line of dots for the seperation, the second time frame (ie. the 4hr normally) has a solid vertical line for the seperation.

The color of the Text for Up/Down can now be modified.

The rules for MOM trade alerts has been corrected to ignore the step direction of the hourly stoch.

TMA with Distances

Updates/Modifcations

The color of the distances in pips can now be modified.

---------

As mentioned in an earlier post there is a chat room available for TECHNICAL problems/queries ONLY!

Questions regarding the actual method should still be directed via the thread.

The address is http://chat.efnet.org:9090/

For ease please choose a nickname which is the same as your forex factory user name

The Channel name is #Kevinator

This is a limited offer and will not always be available, in addition I have to trade as well so please be patient.

Best Regards

with the indicators we use for this nice strategy.

And you also take time to help those with tecnical problems is awesome.

Its people like you and Kevinator P Dean and ohters that give me hope that I

Thanks

Peter

Well put Peter , I agree

So Jmw, good effort-- I feel fully loaded for the new week, Thanks man.

So What advantage is the numbers denoted by the Tma, what is it telling us?

Anyone can chime in of course.

John u are the man!!! good work....

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
Use the numbers as TP or SL.

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
John,

Thanks for the updates and adding the email function.  I cant wait for the new week to start!

Thanks again,

Dan

Hi Docrock

the numbers are simply there so you know the distances to the different bands, this is more important for the shorter term scalp trades.

Sometimes because MT4 rescales the charts the distances between the bands can visually look narrow, but in fact is quite a number of pips (especially after large moves up & down and you have a lot of candles on your chart)

The numbers are simply there to help you better gauge the risk involved, especially on band to band trades.

ie. The trade signal comes for long and the price is below the middle band so still valid, but the distance to the upper band (where you would normally be looking to exit for short term) is only 7 pips away, then it would be better to skip the trade - especially if for a correctly placed Stop at the swing is greater than this.

so simply put - the numbers are there to help you determine risk/reward

Regards

John

Hi Jmw,

Can you advise me how to configure the parameters in the MT4 for email use.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
uh huh , I can see that.

Gracias, lehmann and John MW

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
Hi

To use the eMail facility you need to find out the SMTP server of your eMail system

if you are using a "free" acct. such as Hotmail this information can be found on the web using google

SMTP server for hotmail is "smtp.live.com:25"

In MT4 press CTRL & O to get the options window

Switch to the eMail tabs

Set the check box "Enable"

Set the server to be the SMTP server

Set the logon to be your user id (in the case of hotmail your eMail address)

Password is your password

From & To should be your eMail address again

Press Test and check the journal to ensure you have everything setup

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Thanks jmw.

Will be good to try the email alerts.

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Very good Enoc,

I will join you on those rules, I think I will add one...

8. Stay with e/u only --I only get in the weeds when Ive got too many trades going.

-Rock

p.s. #7. is hard,

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Hi John, I did that but I got these erros :

could you help me?

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
Hi

first of all exit MT4 and restart

MT4 has a bug where when you change some information in this eMail TAB it messes up the data, and can only be fixed by exiting MT4 and re-entering

then try Test again, if it still does not work, then exit MT4 and re-enter and change the 25 to 587

This usually occurs because your internet service provider has blocked port 25 for general access and the MT4 eMail system is very simplified.

If it still doesnt work after that then maybe it is something to do with the combination of MT4 build and your ISP and I cant help you.

For me with Hotmail it works fine.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
EXCELLENT work, John.

VERY MUCH APPRECIATED !!

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
even restarting mt4 it doest work for me ,

but thanks anyway john!!

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
Same here rlpaludo, even tried my wife's email account as she has hotmail like john's but is still doing the same as yours .

May need to talk to your email provider. will let you know if I sort the problem out.

--- 帖子 #1258 ---
docrock, Thanks, I will trade EURUSD GBPUSD EURJPY and GBPJPY reason being since im only trading 1 time i have more setup possibilites with this many pairs. But only 1 trade per shot, my goal will be 2 lots then I will scale out at +50 and let the rest run until 4 hr trend change or trailing stop hit.

yes rule 7 is hard im forcing this on myself i have never been able to take only 1 trade per day or no trades even this a problem im trying to address with this rule.

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
Kevinator ,

Do you normally trade in London or NY sessions? and has anybody tried this during the asian session?

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
30 pips from the begining in the asian session on buying GU! What a great start for the week!

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
That's interesting but how??  The signal for buy, most of the move had already taken place

Short stoch is down, long stoch is up

In addition the range since the start of the asian session upto now has only been

Low 1.61504

High 1.61790

so about 28.6 pips

I am confused.....

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
Could you post a chart?  On my platform we are still in a 26 pip range...

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
It could also be the common mistake of people mistaking pips for points, that I could understand.

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Who here has the whits to program this method into an EA? if Kevin agrees of course?

I for one could use a little mechanical help in the recovery of my account.  Manually trading this method is  GREAT but i miss seem to miss opportunities while scanning for others.

Kevin what do you think?  would you agree an experimental EA of your fantastic method is a good idea?

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
First time I've felt like I'm the predator in the market not the prey!

Just need the discipline to follow the rules and not manufacture trades due to lack of patience.

Thanks again to Kev.

ps. do I have to be fat and rich or can I just be rich?

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
got my 1 loss which is fine now im done for 6/19 next trade allowed on 6/20 EST.  here a chart lack of MOM but setup was per my rules so I took it. -25 pips. price basically has come back down and took me out near the green arrow. Price Touched the lower TMA band 4hr stoch is up hence my long trade at the up purple bar break of high. just wasn't in the cards so I folded. Better luck next time.

--- 帖子 #1267 ---
To me the market at open on a Monday is like a kid on a swing at a park with no friends to push him.

We trade the swings so have to wait for more kids to play and get the momentum going.

I am waiting for a perfect setup- cannot see one happening immediately.

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
Hello

It is the beginning of a new week.

We will focus on MOM trades and take some short term trades based on the mtf 60 stoch.

Trading officially begins at 12am est till 4pm est.

Latest update of the system is located on the first page under *latest update*.

Thanks to John for his indicator modifications and great coding work.

This week will be a profitable week as always and our daily goal remains at 200 pips.

Pairs to trade eurusd, gbpusd, eurjpy, audusd, usdchf, usdcad.If you understand the system and are comfortable then trade what you wish but I recommend the previously stated pairs.

Have the charts open at 12am est and stay focused scanning for MOM trades with the persistent determination of a man or women on a mission.

200 pips is a easy goal if you continue to scan and take the trades as they come.Do not imagine a reversal...let the system and the market put you in trades.Do not exit prematurely, exit at the predetermined point which is the bottom or top of the TMA or if you get a large enough move.

Absolutely do not give back the profit you have made after price has crossed the TMA...that will be your breakeven point.

Take this seriously...act like you want that house...you want those cars and that cash.Relentlessly hunt down these trade setups enter and exit with profit.Your daily goal is set at 200pips.

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
That is odd, my 240 stoch is down! My settings are at 10.3.3. I assume it has changed direction over the course of the hour or so...

Hi Pedross

GAP openings play havoc with indicators - especially multi time frame ones.

On Sunday/Monday especially after a gap I would wait at least until one 4hr bar has closed

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Thanks for the heads up J!

Pete

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Can someone tell me (J maybe) what alerts on current is for?

Attached Image

Pete

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
Alerts on current simply means it will check values for the current open bar, otherwise it will check the last closed bar.

However if you use the Kevinator indicator then you don't need to have the alerts on the TMA, as these are already incorporated.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Thanks John for your speedy reply. I'm using Kevinator2 and I cannot find any alert settings, I'm quite sure it is the latest version.

Your right probabilities were low, I see now the start time is 12am EST which I do Like will revise my trade starting time. and ending time. Thanks.

Do we stop trading at 200 pips if achieved or is this a personal choice? what is the recommendation if any?

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
John,

Thanks for indicator update,

But i still not understand how to use TMA with range value.

Can you clarify with some example how to use the value on TMA with Red, BLue and Yellow color?

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Thanks for the encouragement Kevin.  I have the new template up and on some of the pairs the four hours are opposite.  The 10,3,3 is more sensitive.  My sense is to just stay out of these.  What do you think when they contradict?

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
Hi all,

I have been reading this thread for a couple of days, but am unclear on the entry rules. Can anyone help me in understanding the entry rules better?

Is the trade to be entered only on finding the retracement bar on the Retracement Finder indi? Or should it be a combination of retracement bar + stoch? what is the purpose of the TMA indi?

Thanks in advance

Vicky

Question on latest update:

I've loaded the latest update template, and it displays a chart without TMA bands.  Should I load the TMA indicators manually?

Thanks for any reply

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
Seems like a logical idea,

if you want them , load them

good luck Long Fellow

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
Would that been a good short entry or not because its not at the top of the band?

Thank You!

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
Hi

For me it would not be a signal to go short.

For me that signal for short is 22 candles back from where price is now.

But I cant see what pair it is and I cant see what is previus 4H stoch doing

hello i have just recently started using windows7 and im having a hard time using the unzip on the latest zip file could someone post the indicators in mq4 and ex4 and also the tpl file?  sorry for being "that guy".  it would really help me out and help me to follow along, thanks in advance..

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
Thanks Peter for reply, sorry I should of posted the currency, the chart was EU.

google

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
I don't believe so. ideally, your tp should be at the low band of the TMA which is less than 5 pips. Usually, trades are taken from top to bottom and vice versa. From the name of the system (Kevinator 5m retracement), we wait for price to retrace and then release of energy. it gives very safe entry with ideal nd reasonable stoploss. just wait for the prime setups.

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
jUST double click on zip file and click on extract files.windows 7 has built in unzip capability.

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
yeah that was the first thing i tried.  no avail..thanks for the reply though

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
I started 15 minutes early but from what I have learned here it is the perfect setup.  Got in at 4274, out half at 52 (+22) and the other half at 30 (+44).  I have been reading this site since it started, this was my first attempt.  It was with the 4 hours even though it was against the 1 hr.  But that doesn't matter right?

If you have been trading for the last 4hr you should have been in this MOM trade which would have net about 45+ pips.

Exit is at the bottom of the TMA or hold if you would have gotten bigger bars and more price penetration.

Good afternoon (in Oz land) Kevin, U/C looks to be approaching a possible MOM trade, just wanted to know your thoughts on taking such trade if a MOM set up eventuates.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
Audusd trade was missed also and should have been taken.Another 40+ points.

If you are on top of your game you should be 80+ pips for the day on these two trades and almost half way to your daily goal of 200.

Any questions or comments about this?

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
Another 20 pips for a 100 pip total and the Uk has not opened yet.

Text book MOM setups.

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
Good trades,

If you were here then excellent and you should be up half of your daily goal of 200 pips on one set with three pairs.

To those of us just getting here no matter.There will be many more setups around the corner in the next 12 hours so stay sharp.

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
When watching this live, both the EU and AU trades mentioned were lower than the upper TMA. I didnt take the 2 trades for that reason.

Do we only require price to be above or below the center line at the time of entry?

This is the 4hr chart attached.

This is the movement you have just taken on the 5 m chart.

If you entered that short trade.

This is what you were a part of since we are taking signals from the 240 stoch.

Same goes here- was waiting for perfect indication of trade that never came for me.

Still learning I guess...

--- 帖子 #1311 ---
Yes our rules are to trade 12 am est to 4pm est.

This was just a illustration of what has passed.

No matter as there will be many more setups in the next 12 hrs.

Good morning colleagues, friends, family..

it's start of the week and just wanted to wish everyone success.. i won't say good luck, bcz you make your own luck by just being active to be present for each and every possible setup to scan the hell out of it and get your chunk.

floor is ours, let's get it all... 200? its nothing.. get more, set the b*** high.. lol

positivity... energyyyyyyyyyyy.. energyyyyyyyyyyy..

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #1313 ---
My opinion is that there are not a lot of pips available between the lower and upper TMA (about 14).

Even though the 4 hour stochastic is long and the price at the lower TMA, for a momentum trade I personally would not trade this currency based on the current set up.

This wonderful system provides ample opportunities.

Just my view.

Hi! The next MOM trade setap.

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
The five major pairs

Eu                    stoch both down, RF  ./. , price at lower band of TMA  no Trade

Cable               stoch both down, RF  ./. , price at lower band of TMA  no Trade

AusUSD          stoch H1 up H4 down, RF  ./. , price at lower band of TMA  no Trade

Swissy  stoch H1 down H4 up , RF  ./. , price at lower band of TMA  may a Mom will be setup

UsdCad           stoch H1 down H4 up, RF  ./. , price between lower band and middlw of TMA  no Trade, price rocket up now

Someone see a setup?

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
the way i see it cross the board at moment into bearish move ($$ strength)... so now.. patience requires for good MOM setup and very careful reversal scalp.. must go off matured PA.. bands play a big roll right now.. on MOM must hit the other side of 4hr stoach and on scalp it should go off of more settled band, since 1hr stoach is stepping deep.. and should not jump the gun on the first flash..

these are just advice to keep in back of your mind while things are shaping up at LIVE moment go keep us on our toes and sharp.. at the end its you and your own decisions..

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
Yes valid setup according to the rules.

Kevin,

What technique you going to focus on this week?

60 + 240?

Capture all the pips in fx market?

Do you try this system in higher TF like Daily?

No doubt this is good system on M5 but Daily TF will help part time people like me to capture pips.

So excited about the system but too sad seeing pips flying away because i'm still working in the office:-(

I took shot at this... it may look a bit premature.. regards to not hitting the upper band yet and no rf.. but it worth the risk to me the down side at worst for me would be -15 it it gets away from me at the turn around..

thanks for the Info, but that Trade was confirm by the MOM setup

the Funny thing is now after the fact the Stoch H4 show now Short, but at the moment the setup was it was long , so everybuddy make backtesting , you can forget that , is wast of time.

Analysis on why a lot hit SL in GBPUSD:

Based on my backtest analysis SL at previous high is not enough because this is M5 chart.

GBPUSD SL for this trade should be place at 1.6161 hold it and the trend will turn down soon.

Above just my analysis..lets see how it go later...

--- 帖子 #1384 ---
Spreads seem extremely wide atm with my broker.  Seems a bit thin FWIW

--- 帖子 #1385 ---
Check the original post with my uploads, it mentions how to set the alerts (F3 Global variables)

--- 帖子 #1386 ---
whatever work for everyone according to their own MM..

for me it would be a NO NO for wide SL..

I cut the loser short bcz we are after momentum release.. once its there you get in without much hesitation and once it don't pan out to the plan and no show of release.. i bow down to it and accept the small loss.. but keep coming at it again and again and again.

just my personal approach..

--- 帖子 #1387 ---
hopefully third time is a charm..

this time i waited for the RF went with a pending order 2pips below the bar close..

PA is not showing much momentum for the short MOM trade.. but at the same time its weak on the bullish too.. so with 4hr trend behind us still.. its worth a shot to me..

edit.. -13 on this one too.. np... next

--- 帖子 #1388 ---
You are right! Minimizing your losses and just move on to the next trade. It will spare you a lot of stress. Believe me, when you are hoping it will go one way, 99% chance it will go the other way... Murphy's law. Save yourself the stress.

--- 帖子 #1389 ---
Thanks for your advice Dean!!

I did get burnt with that usd/chf trade this morning and I am live

--- 帖子 #1390 ---
have a peak at m15 and look at the PA within the TMA on M15.. you'll see why GU went up as it did.. (went below lower TMA on M15, so naturally it'll go up to look for upper TMA - might be a PB up for the H4 downtrend)..

Five hours past in a 16 hour trading day.

I am here but am scanning the market and managing trades.

Punisher....trading is like tennis "you do not have to win every match to win the set".

This is like a test of will for you new traders.You can stay strong and keep moving or quit and give up.

I have been trading these setups for months now and will continue to trade this way.

I am here to answer any questions or concerns you have.

--- 帖子 #1396 ---
4hr downtrend, pierce of upper TMA

out -6

--- 帖子 #1397 ---
Yeah, this time you are right.

Smaller SL and looking for better entry:-)

--- 帖子 #1398 ---
it seems that all major pair GU, EU and AU start to change the trend .......

just lost 30 pips on GU setting, still scanning for MOM setup

--- 帖子 #1399 ---
thanks , in that case you have very small SL, will remember that, same Dean say "cut your losses"  :-)

--- 帖子 #1400 ---
As the manager of the system I am the one to take the credit for it when it works correctly.

And I will answer for it if there are any issues.

And I will take all comments questions and concerns so if you have any just ask.

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
kevin,

BTW, what it means the numbers at the end of TMA lines

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
will trade it 20 days and will see the result and will make decision after 1 month, if it bring not 10%/ month, I will leave.

but so long you will see me here

cheers

BTW/  will only Trade MOM trades this month, confirm by the rules for newbies

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
My stops would normally be a little more, but my broker's spreads are very wide right now, so I decided to just get out and wait for a better set up.

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
my Trading style

follow the Rules for MOM Trades

start Europe (Frankfurt) open to London close

risk  20 pips at every Trade and risk from my account 0.5 % per Trade at this 20 pips

I trade real account at Oanda , so I have to careful at News time, because of the spread will wide to ~20 at cable if red news.

if some can improve, please let me know, thanks in advance

have a green tradingday all

--- 帖子 #1405 ---
Could someone please clarify those few basic questions. I've been reading through the thread trying to learn as much as possible..but those couple of things are still a bit unclear..

1. About RF. Should we take it's signal on close of proper magenta bar (5 min of  waiting) or already as soon as it starts to form the right way? I've  seen some controversy in several screenshots. If taken after  magenta bar close, I've noticed that in many cases trade's profitability  decreases greatly.

2. Beginners should always enter with RF signal..on MOM and H1 scalping? With experience, it could be then skipped on MOM?

3. Does the #MT TrendLine_2 indicator come with  all the correct/proper settings automatically..so no need to adjust  anything? Could someone please briefly explain it's basic function,  signals and how to use it in this solid trading system?

Many thanks to everyone for their valuable input!

Hi, short on audusd, let's go to see if this time I have more lucky...

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
It tells you how far away the PRICE is from:

.Middle of the TMA bands (Yellow)

.Top of the TMA bands (Blue)

.Bottom of the TMA bands (Red)

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
TQ Oliver

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
short on nzdusd

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
Cicak

the numbers at the end is the distance in pips from the current bid price to the line

I also noticed you have a couple of indicators twice on your chart.

You appear to have the TMA twice on your chart once only is enough (if you want the numbers to appear leave on the TMA with distances and remove the other TMA's)

You have the 4hr stochastic twice, once in the kevinator indicator (the sea green line) and once seperately

If that is intended (for instance because you want to try out different 4hr stoch settings) fine, otherwise the seperate 4hr stoch is not needed.

Regards

John

I'm long usdcad, short euro and audusd

--- 帖子 #1412 ---
But 1h is down and 4h is up-who you believe?

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
Did too

--- 帖子 #1414 ---
believe the rules, reread the Thread my friend, but will help you :-)

from Kevinator:

If the 4hr stoch is in one direction we should get a good move.If the 4hr and the 1hr stoch match then we get a great move.

cheers

--- 帖子 #1415 ---
Reading some of the posts, it sounds like plenty of people are not 'experts' at using the MT4 platform; this post is for them.....

If you are like me, there will always be something on someone else's chart or template that you don't like:

.the colours of the TMA lines

.the colours of the candles or the background

.the width, colour & style of the Stochastic (some like 2 Stochs in 1 window, some like 2 separates windows)

.same with the Retracement Finder

.etc etc ...

Once you have 'designed' your chart with ALL the indicators needed for Kevin's system and it looks exactly the way you want it, do the following:

1) Click on 'Charts' near the top left (next to File, View, Insert)

2) Put your mouse above 'Templates' (8th line down): this will open a sub-menu

3) Click on 'Save Template'

4) Give that template a 'NAME' that you will easily remember

5) Click on 'Save'

Now open any other chart that you want to trade/study and set it to the 5 minutes timeframe:

1) Click on 'Charts' near the top left (next to File, View, Insert)

2) Put your mouse above 'Templates' (8th line down): this will open a sub-menu

3) Click on 'Load Template'

4) Find the 'NAME' that you've chosen in the previous step, Select it and click OK

This chart will now also be set EXACTLY how you like it and it is a lot quicker than having to amend someone else's template everytime.

Repeat the same with all the other pairs/instruments that you want to study.

If you are following more than one pair/instrument, personaly I find that it's a lot easier if they are ALL set the same and ALL set as I like it.

jmw

this is the template that i upload from the "Kevinator update 3". in that case i shall remove the extra TMA and Shochastir 4hr

BTW, I enter short on GU and AU. any comments from the seniors??

--- 帖子 #1417 ---
But 4h is down so why you enter buy?

--- 帖子 #1418 ---
please tell me what Trade you mean, that by the post info " you know..." was a short Trade

make me confuse my friend, please clear that up

--- 帖子 #1419 ---
Sorry i thought it was a long trade

--- 帖子 #1420 ---
I enter short on eur/usd

edit: 10 pips profit

--- 帖子 #1421 ---
If I may my friend..

don't limit yourself to one setup... because market will show you maybe one look and that could be range-ish market for a while... it will get in directions but not Trending and that's when MOM's setup will fail..

there are many ways to skin the cat.. we do it in two ways in here.. MOM and short term scalp.. both are necessary.. the beauty of Kevin's system is that you can win in today's market as well as yesterday and tomorrow... short term scalp is necessary to be in your arsenal as well.. sometimes those reversal is the beginning of a trend and it can just crush the band and continue for mass and if not.. big deal you get your chunk with the exit at the band.

and.. 5% is way too much... try 2% my friend till you get the hang of things..  sure things could look very rose-ish when we make 100+'s but on other days must stay in contain and lower risk will help.. try to get more pips and more wins under your belt before raising that risk.

these are only recommendation.. do whats right for you.

best wishes..

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
oh yes I don't use 5%, I write a zero and a point before, that will mean only a half percent per Trade  :-)

and the other , yes you right I need both tools in the box for survive I see now as one of the tools a little wrong at this market today, will change my plan to use both.

thanks and green pips

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
How much profit you take my friend?

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
same the rules say if not to much momentum I will out at the line from TMA, upper line at long and visa versa for short

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
Anyone know how to view back alert data after we close  alert pop up window?

I use the attached script. Put it in your Scripts folder, then add it to your Favourites window so it is readily available. When you need to see previous alerts, drag it onto a chart. I have never found a different way of recalling the alerts window.

out cad at the upper band from TMA because of PA and S/R  for +10

so my balance to now  -20-20-20+10  and two open Trades euro and aussie

--- 帖子 #1432 ---
Pete, very similar setup on the Dow to the Euro (these 2 are generally highly corelated instruments) ; I know that indices aren't listed by Kevin as the primary instruments to trade, but a setup is a setup and they're following each other quite well;

Momentum has faded a bit and it's just breached the lower TMA so out for +24

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
Closed AU +14

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
close the AU at the lower band

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
I'm out EU at BE

so my balance  -20-20-20+10+13

= -37 to now

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
Another short on eur/usd?

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Careful with shorts for 3 reasons:

1) TMS bands are now clearly pointing up

2) 1H Stoch has been green 5 hours on the trot

3) for pure MOM trades, 4H Stoch is now pointing up too with Euro at 4272

Instead we could be looking at buying the dip if we get to the bottom of the TMS bands

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
I know i just preparing myself- but 4h is down (for now)

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
The breaking point or turning point I was talking about.

Taking short at the signal.  But if you failed to get out at the low band before the market retracts, and failed also to set the breakeven and SL points, it surely wipes out the account of a passive and newbies' accounts.

Well, considering the fact that I am a conservative trader, I got out at the lower band.  I usually do for a quick profit.  And in the event that the market keeps going the expected trend, I reenter at the at the next mini retracement outside the band.

just sharing what do with your system.

forexforex

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
So i see that only 1h stoch is the good one and not 4h? because 4h shows down trade and 1h shows up-correct me please

--- 帖子 #1441 ---
just my 2 cents...

agree with forexforex

I mentioned about trend reversal too...

it should continue for some time..

now's the time to buy dips

mean eu,gu,ej at least

--- 帖子 #1442 ---
Not necessarily.  I use both and reference each other.  Kev or someone else i think already said that the  240 stoch indicates the larger trend and the 1 hr stoch is shows what happens inside that 240.

The signal is there, but the point that I am trying to make is what you would do if it goes your way and what would you do if it does not.  You have to learn to deal with the many conditions that the chart will bring you and you should establish a firm plan or strategy for each of them.

forexforex

--- 帖子 #1443 ---
sure, agree

trend is your friend, until it ends obviously

--- 帖子 #1444 ---
Trade Management beyond the trigger, it"s a whole other story..

I am not sure if I am allowed to talk about it or its even wise to do so because it requires craft and skill and still sometimes leaves you uhh and ahhh's..

but i recommend to not let your losses to widen too much and watch the price reaction when it reach the bands and make firm decision there to either bank the profit or risk the money on the table to get more with reducing the risk to BE or under 10 pips SL..

we talk more..  I be back later on tonight.

happy N.Y piping.

--- 帖子 #1445 ---
Exactly!,  That is all what is daytrading is all about if you want to last long and be successful in this business.

closed 1/2 @ .8425. Looking at nice set up with 4 and 1hr stochs up.

UPDATE: moving stop to .8425. Bands are tight and will look for 8435, or close out with 10 @ 8425

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
I have enjoyed myself today and made a lot of pips by: waiting for 1-Retracement to send a nice jingly alert checking that the H4 and H1 stochs are both heading in the same direction as the proposed trade checking that the market is within the TMA lines stop loss the most recent swing high/low take profit the opposite direction outermost TMA line adjusting the tp in line with TMA movement The attached makes mucking around with tp/sl a lot easier. It is an EA and lives in the Experts folder. Drag it onto the chart and it will draw a green tp and red sl line that represent the tp and sl of the open trade. If there are no stops already in place, it adds defaults.

After that, double click the green or red lines to highlight them. Moving them forces the ea to modify the trade's stops to reflect the new value of the moved line.

FYI, I have already coded a basic EA to trade this method. Before I release it, I want to trade manually and learn more about the strategy; whatever I learn I shall add to the EA. With any luck, you guys will be able to play with it by the end of the week. We shall see.

steve

i've download your indicator of drag tp/sl but nothing happen in my chart. can you post an attachment of example to use your indicator. or maybe you need to save in .ex4 instead.

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
Steve I have just tested the EA on demo and sl and tp are moving up and down with the current price? any help thanks

--- 帖子 #1456 ---
Its not an indicator, its an EA so it goes in the expert adviser folder. Then just drag and drop to chart. Then a popup should come up with the EA settings where you can setup your tp/sl

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
Kevin,

thanks so much for your system,I have been following it for a while thou. I recently observered that the TMA gives a different sets of value as soon as the charts are closed and restarted offline. The values generated online do not match when checks offline after a while. I was wondering if Im missing something or thats the way it actually is? Please can you clearify on this issue. All the same I have had very good setups using this method,but Im just looking for a way to automate it as my job doesnt allow me be on the system even for an hour at a strecth. Please any advice would be appreciated. Thanks alot

--- 帖子 #1458 ---
ok, then how to save it, in which folder does the file need to be save. i dont have a folder name expert adviser folder. sorry to ask coz i never save an EA before accept indicator in "expert" folder and template in "template" folder.

need some help ??

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
I believe you get the same effects when you change time frames.  So if I see a trade setting up, I go to 15m and then go back again.  Things seem to reset when I do that.

Michael

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
The expert folder

--- 帖子 #1461 ---
Yes, save the file in the experts folder. Then if you have your MT4 running close it and open it again. Then in the Navigator you should see the EA in the expert advisers section.

--- 帖子 #1462 ---
TMATrue doesn't repaint. The attached version doesn't have the pip distances, but it does accurately reflect where the channel was. There was great discussion of this in Nanningbob's trend trading thread, where it was explained that, in the present moment, both TMA indies are in the same place. It's only afterward that the 'pretty' one smooths itself out. For our purposes, I believe either one will work fine.

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
Hi all,

How important is it to use the retracement indi for entries? I noticed that even is the price touches the TMA and the reversal PA happens, the retracement indi does not show the signal for a while. This could result in a delayed entry

Thoughts please

Thanks

Hi,

I put it to you blunt my friend with my appolegies ahead..

EA will not work for this system or any other system... its a waist of time and stops the learning process of everyone..

secondly... saying you made alot of pips will not help anyone.. this is a show and tell thread.. it serves the community better in many ways.. (not to saying that you did not make a lot pis.. its just irrelevant..).. the owner of the thread has been very clear about this issue from the get go.

back to EA story..

Market throws too many different shapes and forms in its unique way.. and it's the simple reason why no automated system has worked consistently up to date and has not produced no real millionaires.. but there are many successful traders who trade manually and put their skill and ability to work each and everyday and has made millions.. that's the wining way and there is no short cut for it..

that's just make take on EA... however be my guest everyone.

just a humble advice with no offense to anyone.

best wishes to all.

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
I think that the tide may be turning. Indeed, there have been very few very successful robots, but there were many, many failures before a powered aircraft was controllable. Now, we accept planes, trains, cars and computers as commonplace. There are a few coders who are at the cutting edge. I happily point out that Hopwood is one of these. He already has at least one, and possibly two or three robots that seem impervious to loss. Time will tell.

Goldman-Sachs reputedly has a rapidly-trading robot that  has never suffered a loss.

A few centuries ago, when I was young, race-cars were all equipped with manual transmissions. Automatic transmissions were a joke.

Look now: all the fastest cars use automatic transmissions, since humans are simply too inefficient.

Best regards,    Glenn

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
Actually, if I'm not mistaken in this thread it is iterated over and over again to stick to the rules, the rules are simple, and they work. To me it seems that this type of system is a prime candidate to be automated.

If you program an EA that follows the rules, what is the difference from trading manually while following the rules?

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
Two words..  Humans Emotions..

that's what your dealing with in market trading.. you can not put a square box around that to produce for you in consistent manner...

GS.. they are different league.. irrelevant here.. plus don't be 100% sure about that.. they are the snake of the market along with other big guns.. don't fall for what they say or do.

--- 帖子 #1468 ---
Thank you Steve for showing interest in this style of trading and attempting to automate it for those of us who still believe that it can be done.

What Steve has given to us already in the thread you reference, simply makes trading manually much simpler.....you should try it!

I would also like to add that many of us have limitations.......I live on the west coast, USA. I cannot stay up all night to trade the sweet spot of the market. Age and personal habits preclude it.

I am sure that Steve will open his own thread for the EA when it is released, and not impact what is trying to be done here by Kevin.

Thank you Steve....Please plunge forward, I beg you!

--- 帖子 #1469 ---
Hi Vickym

Kevin has mentioned this in a recent post:-

In effect - the retracement finder is there to help you in the beginning

as you get better in the logic behind the system the retracement finder becomes less necessary to the point that you are anticipating the retracement signal and entering before.

The retracement finder simply indicates that a retracement has taken place, in time, it is easier to see this purely from price action.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1470 ---
correct my friend... following the rules is the corner stone of any system.. but at same time the smallest discretion/sense by a trader is as important.. to reject a valid signal on entry and other times to accept..

now on exit... we don't have any firm strategy here.. do we?.. its just at the band touch we must still use our discretion to either bank or let it run for more.. now try to EA that i wish you all the luck you want for that.

--- 帖子 #1471 ---
Hi All

My own personal take on an automated Robot is that there should NOT be one.

Too many threads in FF start off with a good system, then are reduced into a constant discussion about robots, completely missing the point of learning the system.

Don't get me wrong, I am not against Robots in general, however in threads that is based on a manual system it should remain that way.

I am sincerely hoping that this thread does not follow the same path as many other good threads on FF by turning into a Robot discussion.

Regards, John

Hi guys, today i couldnt stand in front my pc, how was the day?

does anyone get 200 pips today?

--- 帖子 #1474 ---
Hi Tom... i hear you brother.. west coast is where i live half of the year myself as well, it is a bitch to trade.. but it's far better than waking up in the morning with a margin call up your ass with EA managing your account..  EA is not the solution for you..

a real super-duper EA if it does exist, it will need a watch dog programer/coder on top of it as well... it can not be managed by the avg joe trader only guys like me and you..

to everyone..

believe me guys when i tell you.. i had two programers/coders, real smart experienced ones too who had worked with me and knew the inside and outs of my trading system mentality who could code just about anything that came out of my mouth and put it in codes.. plus the use of any indicators that i wanted them to make and put it to work to bring in the mix of all.. still did not work consistently... plus I had one other guy to constantly watch the damn thing all the time for crash, hangs, vps problems, you name it, etc..

my only problem with trading at this stage of my life is that i am not hungry like i used to and have got lazier as time has gone by...my passion for trading is not on consistent manner anymore.. so to put in less time or when i want i gave the EA a shot.. hired the best.. paid them very well and set a very strategic planning into it.. worked with this guys for over 6mo.. put over 100k worth of investment ... the very same system that i comfortably avg 40-50 positive pips a day consistently trading manually.. did not happen on EA.. I tried, I gave a real serious go at it.. but it did not happen.

like I said.. be my guest.. everyone has to try it for himself to know for real.

this is my last post about EA.

regards,

Dean

--- 帖子 #1475 ---
Very interesting system, I can't wait to give it a try.  Although I cannot hit the NY & London session, I will be giving it a stab with the Asian Market.  I just finished reading all 99 pages on this thread, seems simple enough...wish me luck and happy hunting for everyone else!

--- 帖子 #1476 ---
i concur. for all the trouble that comes with an EA in MT4 you may as well learn to control your emotion and get on with it manually.

--- 帖子 #1477 ---
Wow

Talk about the calm before the storm!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #1478 ---
I see there is some interest in developing an auto-trader, so I have uploaded a first version to http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...02#post4709302

I ask contributors to refrain from discussing the EA here; this thread is about learning to trade manually.

--- 帖子 #1479 ---
Everyone is entitled to their opinions. You can trust in EA's or not. They have advantages as well as disadvantages that users have to learn to live with.

I also think it's a good thing to keep the discusion of a trading system apart from the development of any EA related to it, and from what I've seen in SH's threads, that's his way of thinking too (He'll eventually open up a thread devoted entirely to his EA), so stop bashing this iniciative, there's room for us all, and also keep in mind that SH shares his work for free so what's with complaining ¿?

I do think that when using an EA it's important to be 100% familiarized with the strategy it's attempting to trade in order to spot bugs, errors and to prevent disaster. I don't beleive in "set and forget" EA's, at least not for real money

To end my post, I just want to say that any system that has a well defined set of rules is a good candidate for automation. We all know a bot doesn't have the "market feeling" some traders find necessary to trade, I personally find it's a really cheap price to pay in exchange for just watching money grow while jerking off to my favorite music or movies

Best wishes to all EA and non-EA traders

--- 帖子 #1480 ---
Me too!  This system is the best!  But my problem with forex has always been the hours.  Any suggestions?

For now I try to catch a pre London trade like the EU last night (+44pips, thank you very much!) and get up early to see if anything else is setup.

I took this trade last night on AU. At the time of the trade price was below the Red TMA line.It was against the Stochs but price was below the TMA so I took it just trying to scalp a few pips. My problem is why did the lines move thats a pretty big shift in the lines. Not sure what happened any suggestions?

Trade was at the blue arrow.

--- 帖子 #1483 ---
This has been answered/discussed multiple times in the past.

The TMA indicator is a "repainting" indicator, looking back at historical values is not possible (unless you use the "True" version)

However as this is about trading and not looking back at what might have been, the TMA is fine as is.

Regards, John

Well hard to trust a signal off the TMA then right. I have been trying to watch it more but maybe I will have to reconsider this. When you look back one could get the impression that you could trade the channels. The first charts I posted showing my tades I didn't have the TMA on so will consider taking it back off chart.

--- 帖子 #1485 ---
I would just like to add one possible scenario to this thread not directly pertaining to the development of an EA, but of a very helpful indicator.  I would love to hear from members that are familiar with dashboards and the coding of them as I have found them to be valuable.  I currently use one for another trading strategy, and it has cut down on my screen time, while allowing me to maintain trading manually.  I am able to decide which trades I want to enter while the dashboard monitors trading conditions across all timeframes and currency pairs.  Believe me, it's a great tool.

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
I think that's a fantastic idea.

--- 帖子 #1487 ---
thinking about this what would be required

a) I am assuming you are talking about an MT4 dashboard, not a seperate application (which is possible but a lot more difficult)

b) what information would need to be displayed??

i) what quadrant the PA was currently in of the TMA, ie. OB/OS/Upper/Lower

ii) the current values up/down of the 4hr / 1hr stochs

iii) the retracement indicator value and it's direction increasing/decreasing

then of course the indi would need to have in it's parms all the pairs it is to monitor.

To create an indicator that did not need to have the other charts open would be possible but the processing required on each tick to calculate the data would mean you would have to have a very fast computer

the other option of course would be to have the existing Kevinator indicator (which currently monitors all this information anyway) post the values into memory, to be picked up by the dashboard which would run on it's own clean chart (ie. candles removed etc. so only dashboard is displayed)

All in all sounds like a very "doable" project.

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
yes you cannot trade off the TMA Overbought/Oversold values alone

the combination though of 1hr,4hr stochs, RF Finder & TMA makes for profitable entries.

--- 帖子 #1489 ---
Our discussion iin this thread seem like off topic a bit...

Not seeing much people discussing about how many pips they earn, missed or lose?

Just found People talking about EA & Dashboard

So anyone made 200pips yesterday?

Yesterday seem not a great day to trade with...

--- 帖子 #1490 ---
Sorry its a late chart but took this EJ short and had to leave so couldn't post chart until now. Got +20 short at red arrow.

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
EA's never work for long unless they hardly turn a profit. Why bother? This method is sound, learn it and trade it. That alone is enough...

--- 帖子 #1492 ---
Right Android,

all come back to Trading the system please !!

my result , only trading the MOM trades yesterday  from Frankfurt open to London close was -37 pips, so not a great day for the system., but that one day from 20 for me to make a decision is it a great sys or not.

have a great day all

hi DizzleFX,

you entry looks like a little late for me.

if I trade that pair, I don't, I see the entry like the arrows in my pic, hope you can grab some pips

--- 帖子 #1495 ---
DizzleFX

Why would you trade this pair when Kevin has said on numerous occasions to not trade this pair? Have you had previous success in trading the pair?

To me it's a bit like watching paint dry these days with this currency and personally I can move away from the rules because I get bored with the lack of movement, so I don't go near it.

As I see your chart, your buy is around 80.17 and the top TMA band is at 80.21, so allowing for spread I cannot understand the reason for taking the trade.

We can all learn from others point of view. I look forward to your reply.

Di

--- 帖子 #1496 ---
Well i traded this pair because it was the only one that met all the criteria.  Also, i thought this was one of the major pairs.  I waited for the RF after ir passed the bottom TMA band and i was hoping it would explode upward.  If Kev said to not trade this pair then i missed that post.

--- 帖子 #1497 ---
that's why I don't trade it.

also as I have a small spread, but that's realy hard work to grab some pips at this pair

stay at the major, eu, gbpusd, audusd, usdchf, usdcad and if you can in the right session europe open to london close.

cheers

--- 帖子 #1498 ---
DizzleFX

Thanks for your thoughts.

The last time I can recall Kevin commenting on the pairs to trade was in Post # 1235 on page 83.

As I go through the thread, I cut and paste various comments into a Word document for easy reference of important points. As the thread grows searching for rules and changes becomes a nightmare, so I have found this for keeping track of things is helpful to me.

I took this short from the 240 stochastic.

--- 帖子 #1503 ---
The price yesterday kept going down and down.Anticipating a reversal and buying was not sound enough. My thought on this is that we may have a supporting trend indicator in the form of Supertrend mtf to keep us out of this wipsaws. The system is too profitable when the trend is set.

--- 帖子 #1504 ---
Hi guys what does this number represent in the TMA.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1505 ---
Hi turboguru,

Which rules do you apply for this trade? I mean at the entry time both stoch were probably up, do you add/change any rules or is it just discretion.

Thanks.

Another short from 240 Stochastic.

Morning all,

short on c/u..

let's get back to Live trading and try to get comfortable with this system everyone..  forget other stuff... forget yesterday... as bad as it was still right before the NYS PA took off and there were all kinds of signals most good for at least 30 pips.. and as bad as it was most of did not lose no more than 40 pips.. hell you can make that back in one trade in a half ass day..

focus.. energy.. positivity..   let's do it..

edit..

SL hit for -15.... next

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
Hi

Not to offend you, but please read the thread then you would know.

This have been discuss several times.

And I can tell you, you will learn a lot when reading whole thread.

But thos numbers tell the distance from price to the red line, to the blue line, to the yellow line.

Hi, long on eru/usd, let's see....

Yeah same thinking for me.

Maybe we need another extra indicator.

What do Manager think about this?

--- 帖子 #1513 ---
SL of 11 pips hit

--- 帖子 #1514 ---
so how many pairs you check?

and for not confuse , is it not better to stay by the major same the manager tell us, it make it not easy to control a system if we see here a euro/swissy there may a gold Trade, because then must also show al the loss from that pair.

thanks for help

P Dean offers good advice about getting on with it.

Trading is a business with associated costs. If you operate a business you are liable for a variety of costs such as rent, wages, insurances, phone etc, etc. You may well be into your 5th day or so  each week of running your business before you start seeing any real profit.

I don't know what it is with trading that a loss or two makes a lot of people run for the hills, or maybe on to another thread because this one "has failed". A losing day does NOT mean the system is a failure.

This is a great system and if you are a newbie it would be of great benefit to start at the beginning and read the whole thread, take notes, examine the charts attached to the threads to just get "involved" with the system.

Don't believe that trading is easy, it involves real work, real chart time, real patience and gratitude.

Thanks to Kevin for sharing his system.

Di

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
that has nothing to do by that system here, what was there a signal????

Hi 4H Stock up, 1H Stock Up, when retracement goes up I entered....

Aries,

Does this indicator repaint?

If not, it is good to attach to our chart.

Can you share it?

I'll test it out...also i'll test some simple indi like MA to filter out bad trade.

--- 帖子 #1522 ---
I must have missed the post where Kevin (the thread creator) expressed his wishes for traders to add more indicators to his system

Maybe I missed something?

--- 帖子 #1523 ---
sorry but first I think we make this weeks MOM trades

and second I really not understand full the scalp trade at the upper band from TMA , can we ignore the TMA if we trade a scalp?

thanks for help

--- 帖子 #1524 ---
Wouldn't the correct entry be once the price hit the lower TMA band??

--- 帖子 #1525 ---
Oops..Sorry...

Maybe i need to work this offline....

--- 帖子 #1526 ---
No, we cannot ignore TMA during scalper or MOM trade.

It give us clear and important info about how far the price will go.

--- 帖子 #1527 ---
Its set as a 5 min and 15 min thats the two lines on my chart, i usually take long or short above or below the lines. The trades  are taken from the TMA  and RF 1hr stocastics. Longs safely above the lines and short below the lines. It does not repaint. set at 15 mins the indicator paints lime and red on long /short

--- 帖子 #1528 ---
Hi, yes this is not MOM trade, I saw that EUR seems up in most pairs, and the stochs, and I tried the retracement...

I understand that when market is trending, not always retracements will go to lower band...

But should be Kevin, who says if this trade is compilant with the system, or I was wrong...

--- 帖子 #1529 ---
thanks for Info.

I have a request for all , please follow the rules , and if you will not then not post here some Trades or Indicator.

same the author already say, ask him before, if you have some super indicator or other things

Thanks

because many people want learn and It make them confuse

--- 帖子 #1530 ---
Have a look at this trade.....can't post a chart at the moment  , however looks good!

--- 帖子 #1531 ---
Here is the chart....for comment.

--- 帖子 #1532 ---
at my chart eurjpy at ibfx the H4 and H1 stoch is long and the price is at the top of the TMA, so what you want trade??

ah now I see your chart you may have H4 down, then ok, that's the broker candle time problem  :-), good luck

--- 帖子 #1533 ---
If you look at my chart, it indicates that 1hr is up and 4 is down... therefore according to the rules, I would say that it is a MOM sell trade...maybe there is a difference in feed info from our brokers.

I am trading what I'm seeing in my chart...not yours, but I guess it is important to keep an eye on our broker's feed, so thanks for the comment.

--- 帖子 #1534 ---
as I write the first , I can't see your chart, because you post it later, but then I edit my post also you see.

we posting that problem , different data-feed and candle time already before in the thread and my decision was to follow the chart Kevinator make the great trades.

because I trade not at mt4 only used for charting.

--- 帖子 #1535 ---
may swissy setup will build

--- 帖子 #1536 ---
good spot!

--- 帖子 #1537 ---
Swissy setup

There is not enough room in the TMA channel to take that trade, price already below the middle

To the lower band only 7 pips - spread

--- 帖子 #1538 ---
Interestingly my 4hr stoch is still indicating down despite price going up.

Could others please confirm if in their charts the 4hr stoch is buy or sell please?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1539 ---
your Broker please

GO markets

--- 帖子 #1541 ---
candle time same alpari uk, that's right the H4 on eurjpy is still down

--- 帖子 #1542 ---
Wow...that's interesting, so one broker could be giving a buy signal and another a sell.

--- 帖子 #1543 ---
Not much trade today so far.

Looks nice in hindsight the cable now show a nice short MOM trade, but the problem is the H4 change direction on the last candle , so before as we had the short retrace signal there the H4 not agree because was up!

--- 帖子 #1544 ---
Yes that’s the true if you follow a digital indicator from higher timeframe, he will change so long this TF not close the candle and if you have other data feed whit a different candle close time the result will totally different.

--- 帖子 #1545 ---
So my conclusion is all the nice pic in this thread, where show nice trades and many pips, I don’t believe if I not see a pic from the start at the signal and trigger candle.

all other is only repaint indicator , looks nice in hindsight but is not the true

--- 帖子 #1546 ---
I too, am using Go Markets (Aust) charts, but my Eur/Jpy on the indicator is showing that it is stepping UP whilst the text to the right of the window shows 1h Up and 4h Dn.

I then looked closely at your chart attached to Post #1536 and find that yours is showing as mine does. If you look closely at the 4 hour indicator line running across the top of your chart, the start of the 4 hour period is blue which indicates UP whereas the text to the right is showing 4h Dn in red.

Even  more reason to be alert and check the indicator and not rely on the text.

--- 帖子 #1547 ---
My apologies sir... it is E/C , EUR/CHF..

I check about 8 pairs..

EUR/USD.. GBP/USD.. EUR/JPY.. AUD/USD.. USD/CAD.. USD/CHF.. EUR/CHF.. EUR/GBP..

I don't check any other with base spread higher than 3.. and focus more on the first 4 pairs.

That’s must a bug in the indi  “!Kevinator”, please check that Kevinator

welcome to the real world !

anyone who thinks that can go to the system thread on ff.com and starts getting +200 pips / day is either very green at this...or insane

there is no room for so many millionaires

IMO - take what suits you from those threads and try to create your own strat.

good luck to everyone

--- 帖子 #1550 ---
Hi Di

You're right, thanks for your reply.

--- 帖子 #1551 ---
all who trading live , used the separate indicator for sure !

--- 帖子 #1552 ---
If I load the Color Stochastic indicator and set it to 240 on Eur/Jpy the same problem occurs as in the Kevinator indicator. It is not showing any indication for the last start of a 4 hour period. On my charts, the last indication was at 4am whereas now it is 10:20 current candle.

I also have Alpari charts and this is happening with them too on Eur/Jpy.

All other currencies have the last time period indication showing at 8am on both Go Markets and Alpari charts.

Trading has many challenges...............found another one.

--- 帖子 #1553 ---
i had to step out for a hour..

guys... if you look at the major pairs they all are in a sideways move inside very a narrow band.. if you look at total movement they all are inside 50-60 pips range... so.. market is flat... this tells us it's time for scalp... so the OB/OS off the bands play key rolls..

once you get a alert.. quickly check on two things...

1) 1hr stoach position

2) PA 's band position..

if both are correlated with you signal than you got a valid signal.. take a shot..

at the moment there is no MOM setup until you get a movement outside the current band.. i can care or less what the 4hr stoach is saying now.. i got to see a movement now (swing) than pullback to the other side of band..

this is a momentum system.... what is the momentum now?... FLAT..

get involve on the scalp setup carefully and thoroughly when signal arrives.. than after trigger look for the reaction to the band.. see if brakes it firmly.. if it does maybe its worth the hold for a run.. if not and it's wish washy, bank the hell out of it and wait to see if it returns back to the run or it reverses inside the band again and maybe it will give you another scalp trade with a same chance for a run the other way..

this way you make your scalp trade to make little money and at the same time leave a slight door open to catch the run outside the box and then wait for MOM setup to take more profits..

sometimes if not at least the half time.. Market is not trending and it's either ranging or it takes direction which don't turn into a trend.. so that's why we use this combination.

i hope it helps or clears away.

regards,

Dean

--- 帖子 #1554 ---
Bradu thx for this.

Made me suspicious right from the start. If someone promises you to get 200 pips daily but does not disclose SL, Exit and Money Management Rules I would be very cautious.

Still, for some reasons I like the setup. Clearly as with all strategies there will be major drawdowns and excellent trading times as well. Overall you might get some pips long term with this. But it is nothing special.

Good luck to everyone here!

--- 帖子 #1555 ---
everytime

--- 帖子 #1556 ---
Punisher

before stating that there is a bug in an indicator, check whether the problem is NOT with yourself AS IS THIS CASE.

Look carefully at the picture you posted.

The kevinator indicator shows that it is using 10,3,3,LWMA,C/C as it's inputs (for the second timeframe, ie 4hr)

the seperate 4hr stoch you showed is using 14,3,3,LWMA,CC as it's inputs

OF COURSE THEY WILL BE DIFFERENT

--- 帖子 #1557 ---
I disagree..

many live trades last week has proven that by Kevin and some other guys..(me not included bcz i was not trading full time)..

but.. level of experience plays a big roll sir.. and it takes time for new people to get the hang of this to the level of anticipation..

there is a very thin line between wining and losing in trading we all know that.. a +100 day could turn to -100 easily with couple of simple honest mistakes.

guys..

stay focus.. keep the positivity up..  the mental part of this game is 80% of the work and the way to success.

--- 帖子 #1558 ---
good luck to you as well Mr. negative..  I wonder how far this mentality has taken you.

MM is personal my friend.. everyone uses different brokers.. live in different spot of the world.. account sizes varies.. financial status varies and etc..

it is simply has been put to... have your sl at modest amount for losses and watch the pa's reaction to the band and make firm decision there..

--- 帖子 #1559 ---
Pretty sure my 4hr was red at the time and asia sells EJ alot.

--- 帖子 #1560 ---
the separate Indicator has also 10,3,3, may what you see is the first character come from H4 and then come the periode info 10,3,3

so check it out

--- 帖子 #1561 ---
P.Dean you are doing excellent work here. Thanks for your contributions.

Not negative just cautious and with an eye to newbies entering. Show a newbie nice entries and he thinks he will get rich immediately.... thats dangerous as you most certainly know.

yes sorry,

the second is also 10,3,3

BUT High/Low not close/close

That was from the last Template

I change only the 14 to 10, don't know about the close/close

but I will change that also and take a eye on that again.

--- 帖子 #1564 ---
I like to use TMA True (post#44).

Hope that's not against the rules.

--- 帖子 #1565 ---
ok guys small post with the chart attachment.. it relates to my earlier post..

as you see now that the G/U has taken a direction.. will it be a runner or trend or not it remains to be seen.. but as of right now.. with this powerful system you could have been in it from the start..

as you see scalp trade has turned into a runner trade... you got in as a scalp but PA forced through the band, broke the hell out of it and the chances are good that it will continue and if not.. you can make pretty good profit surpass of regular scalp..

the second note is to show why no set in stone rules should apply in trading.. and the use of craft and skill will make you a big time winner..

the hold to see the PA reaction to the band is something that only could be done manually and all credit goes to Trader skill ability which comes with experience as many many trades goes under one's belt as screen time paying off.

so i made this post to show you some about MM (regards to exit) and the flexibility that it's required to be top notch trader...

best traders in the world are the one's who can Adjust and Adopt in a flash if it needs too.

this is just my analysis and opinions out of my own humble experience for helping purposes.

ps) other major pairs also gave same good signals (I for one missed all bcz of having lunch).. but watch their reaction to the lower band and you see those did not break as strong as G/U so it's advised to take the money and run on those.

--- 帖子 #1566 ---
In hindsigth yes, but not where your red arrow is....It takes alot of 5min candles before the 4hr makes up it's mind and turns red. So, can I take that as a no, you don't apply any discretion or other guidelines? Too bad, could have been interesting.

--- 帖子 #1567 ---
2011-06-21 GBPUSD 5min SELL according with rules.. Stoch 1H and 4H are down.. Retacement to about high band of TMA.. So SELL

(how you upload images here, guys?)

--- 帖子 #1568 ---
that is the secret of this system:

at the trigger of the RF signal the H1 was UP !!!

I look at this 5 major very close.

the H1 change the direction to down after the long red candle, there the price was already near the lower band from TMA.

that is what I tell today , you can't believe the chart if you show it 1 candle later then the trigger candle!!

then in hindsight it looks very nice , but in real time it was not a trade signal.

so all charts show nice trades after the fact is bulls****, that's the secret of this system!

and that was all the chart Kevinator show us here every chart 5-6 candle after the entry that is all nice for show but has nothing to do with the real word.

this repainting indicator let all trades looks very nice after the fact.

so I don't waste my time more here, was only a hype, but I check it and know now.

--- 帖子 #1569 ---
Totally disagree with Helix and Bradu.... I made 115 pips yesterday and 90 today so far and I traded most of them in the asian market ...I live in Perth west Aust and all the daylight hours are Asian session ,so on a good day 200 pips or more is possible... remember we have only just got started with this strategy... even better times are ahead.... I can't help but feel extremely positive for the days and weeks ahead.

--- 帖子 #1570 ---
also here you can see the channel looks different as the price drops down , before more the price was already at the lower band.

I can understand your frustration... your depending way too much on the indicator to tell you where and what to do all the time... indies are just guides.. PA is what its at hand and important..

now all this is just talk and gets us nowhere.. right?.. ok forget it..

...............

now to everyone..

ok..

from next week on when i get my gear up and get organized and be excited again to really give trading a go for full time... i will show you all how you can make serious money.. I will show you all live trades with immediate chart pic right after trigger and snap shots of during and exit time.. sounds good enough..

making a avg 100pips daily is nothing don't you get me started now..

your wakening up the beast now... lol

to not bore you guys going off subject here, so excuse me ahead of time.. the truth of the matter is as of late i have lost interest in many things since the passing of my dear father who i loved and cherished very much..  but life goes on and i am slowly getting back into my two passions..  Tennis and Trading. I try to get busy as much as i can this week..

with this system for a experienced trader it is a piece of cake to make an avg of +100 a week if not 200.. but let's just say 100, with that you can still dream as big as you want.. I prove it to you all that it is possible... I know it's a huge unnecessary burden on me, i got nothing to prove and no need.. but i will do this for the sake of your confidence, your believe and maybe be a way for your ultimate success.. when you lose loved ones, its then you realize that whats really important in life.. more money, fame and material's or spreading good karma and good will to lift others lives and well beings.

I don't want to make to dramatic... so yes.. action speaks louder and sets believe and confidence in heart and soul, and that's what we will do in the right way.

regards,

Dean

This thread is becoming dangerously close to falling apart, I hope Kevin gets back soon to bring some order once again.

Yes there are repainting indicators involved, however the system works perfectly fine without repainting ones.

The TMA non-repainting version has been on the thread for quite a while, and if people search they can find non-repainting versions of the MTF stochastics, that don't flash in the trade direction, then opposite again.

The concept is sound, if you have problems with repainting and believing a system works, either forward test it, or replace the repainting ones with non-repaints.

I use both.  Picture below is with NON-repainting TMA and MTF Stochs, signals are still valid (notice to the left of the stochastics window, the indicator shows bullish & bearish movement within the same other time frame candle)

Regards

John

guys,

i didnt said this system does not work at all....all i said was to keep your feet on the ground. i see you`re a member since 2004, so i guess you know this better.

i`m trading live for only 3-4y and can surelly tell that buying/selling on a CCI 8 (or retracement finder how it is called in Divergence`s thread ) and 1h/4h stoch may be good, but it isnt something extraordinary that can allow you to gain +200 pips/day...

anyway...keep up the good work

Hi

I look forward to reading your posts next week and looking at your charts.

In advance, could you please let us know the indicators (which version) and the settings therein that you use.

The problem with my 4 hr stochastic in the Eur/Jpy has corrected as time has gone by on both Alpari and Go Markets charts (in case anyone is interested).

I don't know how many people have read "Trading in the Zone" by Mark Douglas. If you're serious about trading it is a must read in my view.

I don't use anything fancy... just what you see on my chart which was provided to all in here..

-kevinator.. 60.. 14,3,3.... 240..10,3,3

-RF with alert.. i just changed the A-period from 0.8 to 0.6 for quick reco alert only so i get my self setup bcz i wait for the bar candle to close most of the times and set pending orders 2 pips buffer + spread most times..

-TMA band... regular on.. yes the one that repaints.. its irrelevant the painting.. i trade the now moments and it clearly shows the ob/os or if the damn PA is at which side of the band..

and whole lot of common sense.. lol

that's it..

--- 帖子 #1588 ---
this was a scalp trade.. all i care is the 1hr stoach step.. which is clearly down... plus all day this pair along with most pairs are in range so 4hr direction is irrelevant for a scalp trade..

--- 帖子 #1589 ---
i buy when it does touch..

for now on a ranging pair the angel of the damn thing is meaningless..

that's where you let the indie to dictate too much of what you do and not see the real PA..

my trade was a loss.. but i don't give a rats ass..

just watch me put up big numbers on the score board.

all talk are aside.. remember?... everyone that got something to say.. show me a live chart.. that's it.. should've could've is all for kindergarten..

you guys want real time live trading to believe.. well i give it to you.. win or lose..  you all try to do the same... before you know it everyone has up himself a level or two.. and that's what we want..

lets do it.. next trade... NYS is coming up.. stay alert guys..

--- 帖子 #1590 ---
MOM in the making on G/U..

but won't jump the gun to early.. waiting for a clear RF signal and the close of it than taking a shot..

I let it come to me on such rang-ish day cross the board..

oh forgot...

i can care or less if the 4hr flashes back and forth...

i know i got a semi trendy bear pa at hand and it has pulled back...

the indies just makes the picture more clear and fast for me to see as i flip the pages..

--- 帖子 #1591 ---
Dean, thanks for keeping us on track.  Did you take the cable short?

--- 帖子 #1592 ---
criteria met for short MOM sterling trade

--- 帖子 #1593 ---
yw marlin,

no my friend... as i said i wont jump the gun.. i wait for the rf bar/candle to close and put up a pending order with 2pips buffer.. as you see it never got triggered.. now that the PA might be turned.. I have sort of escaped and will cancel the order and look for the resume of another RF bar if it goes south too much..

--- 帖子 #1594 ---
now you all see my pending order, i set that pending order immediately after the close of the rf bar/candle.. and now look at where the PA is and rf bars... so when i see strong reverse on the candle and rf bar.. i cancel the order and look for the next opportunity..

this way you can save yourself from premature entry sometimes.. which goes a long way..

--- 帖子 #1595 ---
Hi Dean

You're using the RF for entry of a MOM trade whereas Kevin does not.(Post # 1235 on page 83)

I thought the use of the RF was for the 1 hr scalp trades only.

On reading my own reference (above) again, I see that Kevin said that newbies should use the RF as a trigger to enter MOM trades.

The fact that you use it for entry must have proved a better option for your entry rather than entering at the TMA line. Is this correct?

Di

--- 帖子 #1596 ---
i am newbie.. ..

Kevin is maybe skillful enough at this to know how to get out of it fast when he does choose to get in early... i am not.. i may never be..  if you all's case is the same as me.. than wait and not jump the gun.. you get in a few pips later.. but on other hand saves one loss.. that's how i see it.. fits my personality better maybe..   I am not to far from the main core of the concept.. just a bit careful and knowing my own ability.

i escaped a sure -15 loss this time... and on the flip side of the coin on other instance.. i get in a little later and instead of banking +10 i may bank nothing and force to get out at BE.. or instead of banking +20 I bank +14.. but i take those odds.. bcz with my skill maybe if i jump the gun and it turns on me i will get hit big if the PA is too fast on me.

edit.. pending order set on G/U again at the close of the rf bar..

--- 帖子 #1597 ---
triggered now.. Live G/U short..

who bunch of signals came in... I got pending on e/u and e/j..

this trade is in a dangerous time on the edge of NYS.. could fall into silly spike... i took it anyways bcz it could go the other way too.. why waist a solid setup based on what if..

--- 帖子 #1598 ---
Fair enough.

Thank you for taking the time to answer questions. If you want to understand someone's trading, you have to get  inside their head, hence all the questions.

The one thing that jumps out to me about GBP/USD is that price is near a round number....1.6200. Would you take that into account for your deciding your entry or are you happy leaving it with a 2 pip buffer under the close of the RF candle close?

Di

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
e/u live...

--- 帖子 #1600 ---
I for one.. do not give round numbers or s/r pivot or any of this any respect... i go with my setup and my game plan.. once the momentum is there and signals pass through my scanning its done and i look to manage the trigger and beyond with out caring about those bumps..

they all are there and meant to be broken at some point and time.

this is just me and my mentality folks... i answered since it was asked. do whats right for you guys..

--- 帖子 #1601 ---
good work , thanks

--- 帖子 #1602 ---
e/j Live...

--- 帖子 #1603 ---
you all see.. i got three live ones going on...

on a direction less day such as today so far.. this valid setups get stuck sometimes and sl gets hit... but this is the reason why some people make +200 +300 pips a day.. bcz the habit is build already.. you see wining and on good days it pays off greatly and on bad days you lose some... but you practice the same good habit that you have already engraved inside of you.. and you'll come out ahead at the end.

the only way that this system or most systems fail, is when your not present for your own valid setup, regardless..

edit... holding all three still..

--- 帖子 #1604 ---
As per request from P.Dean an updated RF Finder

this one now sends alerts if either stochastic is in the direction of the retracement

it also fixes the bug in the previous version that was allways checking the stochastic EMA value for H/L instead of LWMA for C/C

now the settings are user definable.

P.S. I changed the name as there were too many different versions of 1-Retracement Finder

For everybody....

That's really a trader's discretion but at the same time you could add all these levels that could be in the area of the entry price:

.previous high/low

.fib level

.daily pivot/support/resistance level

.the list is endless

........

I'm a great believer of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) because the first thing that a lot of new(ish)-to-trading people will try to do is add this or that rule and make it more complicated than it needs to be although it's better to miss a trade because of an extra rule than enter a bad trade.

Here we have a fairly simple system provided by Kevin with straightforward(ish) rules so why not test the system using these said rules; that can be done live or paper trading, but if you use it AS IT IS at least you'll have an idea if it works, and if it works for you AND your personality (that's important too - not everybody has got the time nor the will to look at 5 minutes charts).

And if it works then and only then you can customise it to YOU: if you do it the other way round, more than likely you will end up trading a system that bears little relation to Kevin's original one.

Just my 2 cents/euro/pesos....

update on triple..

at the moment each are in -10 loss on a slight turn... you are faced with a decision.. you can cut your losses short and get out for -30 on three tries that could have each given you a minimum of +20 pips..  and you got a choice to stick with it and risk getting hit by the sl or catching the reaction to lower band..

I choose to hold..

edit.. all three sl hit..  do i care.. not much...  i know i was present for my valid setup.. and that's the winning formula at the end..  next

Hi,

I´m new in this forum writing but I have readed all of the kevinator sistem(I spend many days). I tried but only got looses.Where I´m wrong?I started lookin stochastic 4h and 1h. After that something change to look only the 4h. I thing somebody writedown about to look only the 1h and 5m. I don´t know but everything I tryed are loosers.What is the properly way?

Thanks for the help

Jose,

Maybe just try MOM trades to start. Read post 1235

hope that helps

4hr (240) stoch is fluctuating RED and GREEN within 1 to 2 minutes.

Does it suppose to do this?

What is your take on this one?

I appreciate anyone's input.

Thanks is advance,

forexforex

--- 帖子 #1619 ---
This is what Im using, latest

good luck

--- 帖子 #1620 ---
ok i understand, but whats the difference between the 2 lines in the stochs, in the first post theres only one line showing steps?

--- 帖子 #1621 ---
It's simply telling you that the Euro is at an important level where a few pips up or down makes the difference between:

.4H Stoch staying up (green) - still bullish although in o/b territory

.4H Stoch going red (down) - bearish

Dare I say in this situation you can get many contradicting signals during the 4H span as you will get many RF confirmations up AND down.

With an important vote in the Greek parliament today (re bailout), it might be wise to wait until that passes, because the market won't care whether the 4H (or any other indicator) is red or green when the result is announced.

--- 帖子 #1622 ---
Thanks ollieforex,  That's right.  The 4 hr has not completed yet, so it will still change color until the 4 hr is finished.

--- 帖子 #1623 ---
Wait- you need that the price wiil be under/upper the middle TMA ?

--- 帖子 #1624 ---
uh huh, there's two time frames in the !kevinator

--- 帖子 #1625 ---
The close of the 4hr candle was the candle before my trade. When the candle turned black it starts the 4hr red as it starts the 4hr candle down so pretty sure it was red.

--- 帖子 #1626 ---

I put the TMA distance into my MT4 but the numbers do not show. Is there a part of the indicator that needs to be switched on?

If not no biggie I can survive without it.

Kev said his last post 1404     Quote ..........

As the manager of the system I am the one to take the credit for it when it works correctly. And I will answer for it if there are any issues. And I will take all comments questions and concerns so if you have any just ask.

Kev is the master and creator of this system who knows how to trade it better than anyone else and he is  is missing!

Its Kevins thread!!

Hey Kevin please come back, we need you guidance.
You are the main man!!

--- 帖子 #1628 ---
simple question,

have you removed the previous version of TMA from your chart and added the TMA with Distance on

if yes, have you checked the colors in the parameters to make sure they are not the same as your background

if this still doesn't resolve, take a chart press CTRL I and send me a print screen

Beginner's question about this indi..

Does the #MT TrendLine indicator come with  all the correct/proper  settings automatically..so no need to adjust  anything? Could someone please briefly explain it's basic function,  signals and how to properly use it  in this solid trading system?

I've noticed that many times line direction is the opposite to system signal (and the stoch 4H).

Many thanks to everyone for their valuable input!

Good luck for the upcoming europe/london open!

--- 帖子 #1634 ---
Whre is Kevin?

--- 帖子 #1635 ---
Which is exactly what I have done guys, I've moved on, taken what I needed, remedied the major flaw which was the stepping stochs, and done some subtle mods.

(It is impossible to back test this without using TMA true, and even then the stochs are unreadable. If I cannot backtest before forward testing then my time has been wasted)

My method is now working well for me, although it's early days yet...

TP is also far more modest

out at the touch of the lower band for +14..

edit... lowered the risk to 5pips on the other two.. with not much at stake and some money in the bank i sit to see if these to make a move to the lower band too..

2nd edit... sl hit on e/u and e/j for -5 each..

Would very much like to know how you are using it.

Cad is setting up for a long

--- 帖子 #1643 ---
ok.. same as the last two days market still got no juice..

as long as it stays in the range mood (50-80 range) I will ping pong its ass all day long... so bands ob/os plays key roll.. making sure it does show obvious ob/os than one of the stoachs to match till hopefully on one of these shots we get band crush..

if trade goes against me right away.. well hard sl could be hit...

if trade goes against no so right away i look to lower the risk (like what I did on e/u and e/j trade earlier) and see if it gets to the target..

so a little inside of what i will do for now..

--- 帖子 #1644 ---
good reco...  all you gotta do now is to trade it.. lol

cad.. i stay away from it since its super range inside narrow band (30pips range)..

welcome to the thread.

--- 帖子 #1645 ---
thanks! I've been wanting a dynamite short term method to compliment my reading of price action on the higher timeframes. This is it.

Thanks for all your posting.  Just remember that in less than 8 hours is the FOMC announcement.  It may be a good night to take off.

I'll keep that in mind for next time   I'm running a grid ea on the same account so lots of lines on the chart...  looks a little scary with that scare bar but I still have faith

--- 帖子 #1649 ---
I am aware of that.. and historically prior to this announcement market goes to sleep.. so thank you.

but I always give it a go in the begining of the european session just incase to not miss anything..

secondly.. i like to put myself up to challenge on such days to sharpen up my skill... as to being sharp on much timelier entry and exit based on the day at hand...  to succeed in this market you atta see and trade all it's form and shape so you never find yourself off guard..

that's the approach here today..

--- 帖子 #1650 ---
I hear ya Bro!  I'll check in when I get up after 9am Phoenix time!

--- 帖子 #1651 ---
guys... since the market is slow and we all here anyways... lol... if your all up to it let's do a little exercise which I think is vitaly important one.. and that is.. the SCANNING part of this system..

as you know we get a lot of signals, the alert sound goes off often.. but not all signals are valid, so the part of the success lies in the scanning..

now let's take today's signals from European open up to now and tell us how you scanned it or how you saw which is valid... I know its hindsight but hey it won't hurt..

on the next post I go first to tell why i reject and accept the days signal so far..

--- 帖子 #1652 ---
OK, I wish I had taken this one!  2 step downs on the 4 hr and then got overbought.  But I was gun shy after several losses!

--- 帖子 #1653 ---
I recommend to look at the principals introduced in this thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=255586  and add for jedi warrior results

--- 帖子 #1654 ---
e/u.. so far 2 signals... I took the first one which I live played lost -5.. and there was 2nd one which was the re-entry on upper band again.. I rejected due to low movement and I already had taken shot on that direction

g/u.. one signal.. i took it from the OB with 4hr inline and got +14 at the touch of lower band (which has repaint now).. but looks like now its a major runner and its the only pair living in it's own world... lol

e/j... two signal... i took the first one short from OB 4hr inline.. run into a middle band bump and i my sl was hit by half pip for -5... I should have banked positive on that... second signal was long but rf bar closed at the middle band and I rejected due to not enough potential gain considering the band exiting..

a/u..one signal for short from ob band.. i rejected since i was on 3 other trade for the same direction but the signal was valid and its doing sideways since..

cad... one signal for long os band.. i rejected due to being super (27 pips total movement since open) range inside a very narrow band (10 pips wide).. need to see more to even play ping pong..

u/c... there may have been couple of signals.. but the pair is too range 25pips movement overall no potential gain inside the band to play..

e/c.. two signals.. first one short off the os band 4hr inline at the edge of london open.. i simply missed it.. valid and profitable one... second signal for long of os band 1hr inline.. I rejected since the RF bar took off although way to the other side of the band.. too bad bcz i was gunning for that big time..

e/g... one signal 5min before European open.. which at the time the pair was supper range inside a narrow band which i would have at the time rejected big time.. but it has took off and now we can look for MOM on that..

that's it.. these are the 8 pair that I watch dog.. lol

your turn..

--- 帖子 #1655 ---
if you had taken this.. you think you would have stayed in it for the second burst up to now??? .. lol

don't think hindsight.. that's markets evil-ish secret..

but if i see anything i will Live play it or give heads up..

--- 帖子 #1670 ---
looking at the EUR and AUS at the moment, they look most likely to signal something, and Eur/Jpy.

not necessarily, different brokers have different 4hr start times, you can only trade what you see on your chart

thanks can u also say what i should be looking for regarding indis, coz im still finding it hard to spot setups

--- 帖子 #1673 ---
I am looking for the price to go to the upper band, the stoch on 1hr 4hr are still signalling a short, then wait for the RF to signal a short.

--- 帖子 #1674 ---
I don't know how much of the thread you have read.

There are 2 different systems in this thread, one for scalping using,among other things, the 1hr stochastic and the other being momentum trading using the 4 hr stoch.

There are Rules for the system attached to the first post in the thread. Furthermore, if you go to page 83 Post # 1235 you will see Kevin's run down on the momentum trading.

There are numerous examples throughout the thread on both systems.

One of the things I don't think you recognise as yet is that people may have their 4 hour time period starting at different times to other thread contributors because of the different brokers chart feed times. This can give opposing stochastic signals compared to some, so you have to decide which charts you want to use. There are oodles of brokers out there from where you can get demo MT4 charts. I use Go Markets (Aust), Alpari and Interbank. There first two have the same 4 hour period, the last starts the 4 hour period 2 hours later. So you have to find what you can live with.

John (jmw1970) recently posted a chart for a scalp trade. His Ultra Stochastic Color 30 min indicator is something with which I am not familiar, so I have no idea why he is using that instead of the Kevinator indicator. He is however, a generous contributor to this thread and may enlighten us as to his reasoning.

I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1675 ---
AJ1 and duffy, thank you both for your comments, helping alot, i understand the eur usd potential trade that might be coming, so regarding that trade would you short on close of a down rf bar or would you sell as soon as the down rf bar appears during that 5 min period? many thanks for your help

as of typing the eur usd has reached the top of the tma, now waiting upon downwards rf bar as stochs signalling short. so only other thing i need to know is the above wait for close or sell as soon as bar goes down on rf

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
follow up to my post above, both stochs on my screen are now up?

does this make this trade now invalid?

--- 帖子 #1677 ---
Hi Duffy/All

yes I do use slightly different versions of the indicators, well in actual fact I use both, I gave my reasoning in post 1586, which is basically people complaining about repainting indicators.

the chart i posted earlier on the EU trade uses non-repainting indi's, I was merely pointing out the fact that the system works with both repainting and non-repainting indicators.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1678 ---
Hi DeanKenny21,

your reasoning would be correct for a short if either the 1hr or 4hr stoch is down, maybe you just didnt mention this but I wanted to make sure.

--- 帖子 #1679 ---
EURUSD - +18.2 Pips (see post 1672 for entry)

PA got to my intended TP at the top of TMA and went thru it, so I decided to let the trade run as a MOM trade but to ensure I didn't give too much back of my hard earned profits I moved the stop to the original TP (which got hit)

--- 帖子 #1680 ---
Kenny I always wait for one of the stochs to be onside when in the trade.

As Duffy pointed out for the scalp trade 1hr has be onside and for the MOM 4hr.

Right now short EUR/JPY from 115.34  SL 115.50

--- 帖子 #1681 ---
thats pretty much the entry i got

what you aiming for as im out for about 10 or 11 pips

im also currently +16 pips on a eur usd short, with the 4hr stochs stepped down, where should i be aiming for, or what should i look for to exit?

--- 帖子 #1682 ---
Closed 115.18  +16 pips

--- 帖子 #1683 ---

Deankenny21 / AJ1

a gentle reminder, this is a live trading thread, when posting trades show a screenshot shortly after you have opened (but make sure you do the important things like set SL before!!) so people can see what you are seeing, different brokers/different timeframes can give marked differences.

for instance the EU short you just mentioned didn't even show up on my charts as a possibility for a trade.

This is how people learn to trade this method effectively.

In addition, should you be unlucky and the trade goes against you, other members can give (hopefully) helpful advice for future trades.

By the by, congratulations both on positive pips, everything seems so much easier with a few wins on your belt.

sorry i will try to post as i trade in future, sometimes copying pasting chart uploading etc when u enter a trade while your trying to moniter is hard for me lol

anyway here is the eur usd trade i took, vertical red line where i entered after confirmation of down rf bar, 4hr stoch showing down with price near top of tma, according to rules i should see some momentum push this price down, did i see everything right here?

regarding the cut/copy/paste thing, there is a script on the thread (look at the paperclip) which you can add as a hotkey and will do all this automatically for you.

one thing that is not mentioned is also to check not only the pa at the target line, but I also find it helpful to check at the mid line.  sometimes it just wont go to the upper/lower line

--- 帖子 #1693 ---
ah i see, so kind of aiming for the opposite tma line, while watching for PA around the middle line too.

So let me just clarify, if 1hr stoch is up does that mean should really be aiming for less pips, if only 4hr is in correct direction should we be looking for more of a push, and if both in right direction we should be hoping for larger pips?

--- 帖子 #1694 ---
Well done Dean, good trade, the narrow TMA's put me off.

Hope you are now getting the hang of the system, and what to look for.

Aj1

--- 帖子 #1695 ---
you've hit the nail on the head...

1hr up - try to scalp to opposite TMA

4hr up - looking for past the TMA

1 & 4hr up - hoping for a big move

however regardless for me, my initial target is always the opposite TMA band, I make in-trade decisions at the mid-band and the target band

because sometimes what initially starts out as a scalp to the opp. band (ie. 4hr not in alignment) can change into a full blown high momentum trade.

In earlier posts when i post the entry, i generally also mention my thinking of what i am going to do (post 1672 is an example) this is not necessary to post BUT with all trades you should at least have in your own mind a plan of action.

just entered a sell on eur jpy

again did i do things right here

down rf bar with both 1hr and 4hr stochs showing down?

http://i55.tinypic.com/29byfx0.jpg

--- 帖子 #1697 ---
I would like the price to be somewhat higher in the TMA's for a short.

rgds Aj1

--- 帖子 #1698 ---
i see, it is going against me somewhat too. Always good to learn from mistakes.

Also that pink line, do you ever pay much attention to that before u enter a trade also?

--- 帖子 #1699 ---
that would be classed as a risky entry, price is already past the mid band

for long you are looking to enter close to the lower band, for short you are looking to enter close to the upper band, the further you are away from the band the riskier the entry and there is a reduced risk/reward

trade might be ok, but it is riskier

--- 帖子 #1700 ---
gotcha, im learning boys, cheers

--- 帖子 #1701 ---
don't forget you need to have in your indicators folder the indicator TMA called (does not have to be on chart)

this is an updated RF finder for those people not using the kevinator indi.

--- 帖子 #1702 ---
Thanks a lot my friend..

--- 帖子 #1703 ---
Dean Kenny,

This might help, a review by simpleguy( from Steve H EA thread) click link to see all summary:

Hi all, got 18+ on this one.best system ever .Think it's a MOM

--- 帖子 #1705 ---
Hi jmw1970

I have searched through the entire paper clip for your  Ultra Color Stochastic 30 indicator and have not been able to find it. Is it possibly hiding there under a different name?

Or would you post it please?

Thanks

Di

--- 帖子 #1706 ---
yo , i entered that too managed to pull 11 pips from that one

--- 帖子 #1707 ---
try looking at the bottom of this post, google also works

regards, John

--- 帖子 #1708 ---
Thanks for pointing out re the Color Stochastic.

I've added the other link to my records.

Sometimes you see what you want to see. I'll read an entire posting in the future, including what it says under someone's name.

Thanks for the help you give people.

Di

--- 帖子 #1709 ---
Hello docrock, according to the summary you dont have to wait for the candle close?  just enter right when the RF bar breacks the zero line?

--- 帖子 #1710 ---
good question... Seems that is a decision we will all need to make on a trade by trade basis.  There is a bit of intuition involved, right.

--- 帖子 #1711 ---
I always wait for the candle to close.

Aj1

--- 帖子 #1712 ---
another question, if you sell according to rules rf bar down all stochs down, but then another rf bar forms upwards do u exit early or let it ride?

--- 帖子 #1713 ---
I see people posting winners and that is awesome.. market is making a push and it maybe breaks out of the range-ish mode post Fed announcement..

i got hung up a bit with technical stuff so my apology for not doing any live trades.. a few good setups slipped away from me.. np.. we rock on tomorrow..

happy piping to all..

special thanks to John for helping us with the tech stuff.

Dean

--- 帖子 #1714 ---
I'll second that

And to you too PD,

until fearless leader returns you two lead us upward

--- 帖子 #1715 ---
Depends on your risk apetite, eh

I go back and forth, real tight stop or let er run

Just must determine for oneself, big boy

--- 帖子 #1716 ---
Dean, This is a winning system, i dont find anything better for a person who does short term trades. If you are of the type holding for longer gains also this is good enough. John has done a beautiful job with the  modified indictors give me more confidence than the older RF indicator. It totally became a free for all bashing of the system. Trading off the 1hr stocastic and RF does get you in and out without trouble. The 4 hour is another matter, when 1hr and 4 hour align you do get big moves.

Regards and let peace prevail

--- 帖子 #1717 ---
Hi Ericoco,

can you please share your template and indicator?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #1720 ---
Could someone please briefly explain it's basic function/signals and how to properly use it  in this solid trading system?

I've noticed that many times line direction is the opposite to system signal (and the stoch 4H). (?)

I recall Kevin using this indi, but not many more according to recent screenshots.

Also if someone has the screenshot-capture script, mentioned few pages earlier, could you please share it. Looked through all attachments and could not find it.

Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #1721 ---
Hi

this is the screenshot script kindly provided by zznbrm

just add it to a hotkey then it will save automatically a picture of your chart.

--- 帖子 #1722 ---
Thank you very much, that's exactly what I was looking for.

Could you please advise me with the #MT TrendLine indicator. I've noticed that you do not use it yourself. What would beginner like me benefit from it.. only visual trend confirmation (which is the opposite to 4H stoch many times), or?

--- 帖子 #1723 ---
sorry cannot help you with the trendline indicator, as you correctly noticed I do not use it so have no idea how it works in conjunction with this system.

--- 帖子 #1724 ---
Whats the difference in the 2 RF indicators when I put them on the chart they are te same for me.

--- 帖子 #1725 ---
Hi Turboguru

I would hope so, otherwise i've messed up the code somehow!!

the indicator posted today is for people NOT using the Kevinator indicator who wish to have alerts, ie. they have there own versions of stochastics indicator (like myself).

The RF finder will basically alert on possible trade setup's based on where the PA is to the TMA and the stochastic settings.

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1726 ---
I still have the first one and when I load this latest one I get exact same up/down bars

--- 帖子 #1727 ---
Long on the cad

--- 帖子 #1728 ---
you should of profited nicely from that, what was your reasons for going long here?

i see the rf signal to buy but the 1hr stoch is stepping down?

4hr is stepping up, but rules state only use 4hr stoch for when pa is crossing the outer tma lines, look forward to your response.

edit: i just noticed it was returning from the lower tma line, is that what you saw?

--- 帖子 #1729 ---
Yes.

Looks like the same trade is setting up again..

--- 帖子 #1730 ---
nice one on the pound  (I'm in on another account)

--- 帖子 #1731 ---
Took a short on the NZ

--- 帖子 #1732 ---
Interesting, notice how the 4h stoch has changed its mind already. The trade still looks good to me but if it breaks the recent high I'm out with a small loss.

--- 帖子 #1733 ---
NZ stoch changed it's mind too!  But I like what I see when I look left.

--- 帖子 #1734 ---
good morning everyone..

Live on e/j...

--- 帖子 #1735 ---
Morning P.Dean,

Can you tell me why you have the 30 stoch on your chart, have you changed to this permanent or is it something you are trying out?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1736 ---
permanent..  it produces better to get in earlier and not miss opportunities overall especially if market is directionless..

that's just me.. you guys do whats right for you.

--- 帖子 #1737 ---
this bastard U turned really quick on me before hitting the band under +10 profit due to London open and it was on it's way to hit the sl.. but survived that by a hair as you see.. than I did not hesitate to get the hell out of it when got close to my entry.. so out for -2..

--- 帖子 #1738 ---
Hi Dean,

Do you think if I set to 15M it will be faster and gets in earlier?

Thanks

Harry

--- 帖子 #1739 ---
Hi P.Dean,

in the last days i read kevinator system,

not cleaar to me about SL and TP,

can you please clarified me for the same?

Sorry for my bad english.

Best Regards,

Antonio

--- 帖子 #1740 ---
it sure will... but it might be too premature..

ok.. this is what i recommend guys.. but it requires some discretion and trader savageness..

when you see the market in range sort of movements like it has been this week.. set this at 30m.. so you can ping pong and get in more timelier.. and when market is trending go back to 60m..

it's just a recommendation.. 30m might just work better at all times..

--- 帖子 #1741 ---
Hi Antonio,

your English is fine my man..

there is no set rules for sl or tp nor MM..

but what you can do is to set your sl based on last H/L L/H's and your tp would be PA reaching the band... you can use your skill and give it a extra hold when it does touch the band to see if you get a strong break through off the band and may hold for some extra pips and possibly catching a runner..

--- 帖子 #1742 ---
Hi P.Dean,

thanks for your fast reply.

Best Regards,

Antonio

--- 帖子 #1743 ---
Hi Dean,

Thanks for your opinion.

Harry

--- 帖子 #1744 ---
you guys noticed my e/j exit..

i will explain you might find it useful..

two things were done on that trade which only and only relates to traders ability and skill which comes with experience, mental control and it is vital to one's success in market trading..

1) I did not quickly fold or panic when trade went against me so rapidly.. I let it settle out of the quick burst and sure risked getting the sl hit..(but since its within my range of my comfort risk, its ok)

2) did not get greedy and closed it for minimal loss once PA presented the opportunity.

not hoping or gettinggreedy to say, ok, now it will burst up to the upper band, let's wait to make profit out of it... now why? bcz i know my trading style.. our trading style is base on momentum release.. if don't pan out to that its time to look for the best way to get out for lesser loss..

PA and chart most times talks to us..

however there is a thin line between not making a panicy, premature exit and not waiting too long to exit.. and it comes with experience and many many trades executions under one's belt..

this is called my friends... being in control of situation and not the other way.

we got no set MM here... but this kinds of Live trades could show you different looks and forms in order to help you make your arsenal of trading better, i hope.

now... try to EA that.. lol

Dean

--- 帖子 #1745 ---
Thanks Dean,

How would you define momentum release?  Same as Kevin with his momos?

--- 帖子 #1746 ---
yes, based on what we have here.. the indi's that we use here..

RF, stoach and the band matching.. that's it.

--- 帖子 #1747 ---
question...

is anyone using the new RF indi that John posted per my request?.. and if you are... are you getting bullish alert? bcz on mine today it only alerts the bearish signals..

john is not here yet.. if you can help i would greatly appreciate.. i am horrible on tech stuff..

--- 帖子 #1748 ---
i'm getting both

--- 帖子 #1749 ---
Hey Guys,

In response to some questions from earlier, I would like

to throw in my 2 cents. There are many ways to trade this

and I urge you to put the time in as this is a golden method.

Personally I will not be taking trades from the 60 minute (or less)

stochastic, only in the direction of the 4 hour (if it looks "right")

which I will explain here: in the first picture you see that the Euro

is saying 4hour is Up but when you look at the 4 hour chart with

the 10,3,3 linear weighted stochastic, it hasn't had a bullish

cross yet and it's a very strong down trend for the last 4 bars.

This doesn't look "right" to me and I will ignore the long trade.

So far during the last few hours I have had 3 winning trades,

(pound, nz and cad) based on the 4 hour. For me there are enough

"high quality" opportunities per day with this method that I will

ignore setups from the lower timeframe.

(not that there's anything wrong with that

--- 帖子 #1750 ---
straight PA showed you the way and you went against it. Break and retest perfect short I know its after the fact and all but PA for the short was there. My 2 cents. The indicators to me are nice to help confirm PA. I suggest everyone that likes this system also read "Price is Everything" and "Romancing the Price" thread on FF it will save alot of trouble and really puts things in a different light. But again my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #1751 ---
e/u Live... both stoch same direction... band matching too..

let's see what happens..

--- 帖子 #1752 ---
Thank-you, I haven't seen the Romancing the Price thread yet, looks great!

--- 帖子 #1753 ---
Without the Indicators this is what it looks like to me and the H4 Stoch is still down. Have to run to work will explain if any questions when I get back. Good pips to all.

--- 帖子 #1754 ---
No problem

--- 帖子 #1755 ---
this is a perfect example of a trader that is lost in threads...

this chart and post is irrelevant to this thread..

i am not going to even explain it.

don't be offended but you left me no choice..

--- 帖子 #1756 ---
Looks like a bear flag to me.

--- 帖子 #1757 ---
Thanks Kevinator!!!

AUDUSD - Sell trade

Slightly risky as the price only just retraced to the mid-band which meant entry after the band, but as both stochs were in alignment I decided to take the risk, however initial TP is not at the lower band as normal, but the previous swing low

--- 帖子 #1759 ---
just sold eur gbp 4 hr down, returning from crossing the upper tma line we shall see fingers crossed

http://i52.tinypic.com/e6prfn.jpg

--- 帖子 #1760 ---
nice one!

--- 帖子 #1761 ---
Just like to say that this thread / strat has helped me no end

its made me really learn to read PA S/R in conjunstion with the strategy

One of the best things I did was to have a real account but keep my lots very low whilst I was learning

Then you have to immerse  yourself in the market and experience ranging, reversing, trending,  finding  hot pairs ie weakest and strongest

wathcing different TF's for entry

and most of all - WHEN NOT TO TRADE

By having a reall account the thought of losing dosh? be it just a dollar ago really makes you learn strategy and forex in general

I relaized the losses made me keep on and readdress my problems like why did it go wrong ? , what did I do wrong

PLEASE if you really want to learn Forex open a live account and use 0.01 lots

You will see

PS im in a nice MOM on EG at the moment

--- 帖子 #1762 ---
wow finally, someone who thinks just like me, endless times i been on demos and tripled them in a week. go on live and i lose!!

Demos are for FUN only i say. I would not really use them to learn if your thinking about real trading.

Its only since i opened a very small account with $400 measly dollars trading at a minute 0.01 lots, when i lose its not much, but its still real money, so i feel the emotions, and after time was able to control them, and this is only with a real live account, my account now stands on over $600. I will never touch demo again, my demo is trading at the smallest lot size, you will not feel or control your emotions with a demo. My 2 cents

in the meantime im enjoying my eurgbp short

--- 帖子 #1763 ---
im out of this for +15 pips after touching the lower TMA, it just feels too easy sometimes, i feel wrong, like im breaking the law haha

--- 帖子 #1764 ---
AUDUSD +  12.6

for entry see http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post4719058

Price passed my initial TP so SL moved to TP and left to run, SL hit

--- 帖子 #1765 ---
good pipping, lets keep scanning

--- 帖子 #1766 ---
If any of you use scripts to set your buy or sell and are MQL savvy you can put this in your script to save a screenshot at time of entry in the  experts/files dir

if (TakeScreenShot == true)

if(!WindowScreenShot(StringConcatenate(NAME + "-" + Symbol(),"-",Period(),"-",TimeToStr(TimeCurrent(),TIME_DATE),"-",Hour(),"H",Minute(),".gif"),size_x,size_y))

Print(GetLastError());

and declare your variables

extern bool   TakeScreenShot  = true;

extern int       size_x = 1280;

extern int       size_y = 720;

Please dont ask for my script as its not mine and I dont want to release it due to copyright

also set your scripts up as hotkeys ie ALT B buy ALT S sell

--- 帖子 #1767 ---
To you too, I see from your post a few minutes ago.

I am glad to see that you are now able to take the correct entries.

Very shortly you will be able to anticipate the entries and not need to worry so much about where the PA is in relation to the bands and RF finder but don't worry about that for now.

What you need to remember is that 99.9 % of indicators (the only exclusion being indicators dealing with volume only) is only showing you PA but in a slightly different way, after a while your brain will automatically see what the indicator will do based purely on what you are seeing in terms of PA.

--- 帖子 #1768 ---
Kevin has gone from this thread?

--- 帖子 #1769 ---
yea cheers dude,

im still getting mixed results on 60min trades i take.

eg, eurusd live pic below, 60 mins is up, rf looking to go up anytime soon, but 4 hr down, would you buy this if rf points up?

http://i51.tinypic.com/2u3zf40.jpg

--- 帖子 #1770 ---
I personally wouldnt

the 60 min trades are better in a ranging market (like early yesterday), when visually you can see a clear downtrend in recent PA (and if you look it generally just bounces of the Mid TMA and back down) the 60m trades can wipe you out

my AUDUSD trade was such an example, trend was clearly down (not only just because 4h stoch but visually) the retraces went only back to the mid line, so I took a calculated risk on a short when it was passed the mid-line, but ignored the possible 60m long

--- 帖子 #1771 ---
This is true

you can get away with just pivot level/ round number  indie and maybe a moving average

Ill tell everyone something else

Have you ever noticed that you see a candle making new ground , like it looks like a cert to be continuing only for it to reverse the second you trade and you start to think the whole fx world is against you  and is telling you not to do this?????

Does anyone know why this happens??

--- 帖子 #1772 ---
so basically if you can see a clear downtrend visually, ie all tmas sloping down somewhat, and you get a long signal on the 60min stoch and rf goes up, you would not take this trade?

--- 帖子 #1773 ---
personally NO, when there is a clear trend defined, I would not try to trade the retraces

when the the market is rangebound (and with enough distance in the range) then yes I will happily take trades bouncing between the bands (ie. the short term ones)

otherwise no

Now I may not take as many trades as other people but I have a very high win/loss ratio.

--- 帖子 #1774 ---
it depends a lot on your broker, however a lot of brokers hedge the clients trades, so you (and numerous other people enter a sell at roughly the same price) the broker then will often hedge the combined total of the lots with a buy sending your order into reverse

--- 帖子 #1775 ---
OK first of all I thought it was  because your price rushes between levels ie Fib , Pivot  , so you are posting the trade just as it hits the SR and hence it bounces back

but you have me thinking now

could be a combination of both

which makes me think of another thing just for laughs

If you want to trade in superscalp mode just trade the reverse of what you expect ie if you see the candle make a new low just set a opposite trade  and pocket after say 3 pips of reversal

--- 帖子 #1776 ---
May be a silly question, but what do you look at for a clear trend, just the 5 min chart, or do you look at other things?

--- 帖子 #1777 ---
I use the simplest method available

i take a chart, i look at the lh side and see where the price was, i look at the rh side and see where the price is

if rh is clearly lower then downtrend, rh clearly higher then uptrend, otherwise rangebound

simple but effective

so for me (regardless what the stochs say) i see

gu down

eu down

au down

usdchf rangebound

ej down

usdcad rangebound

BUT this is my opinion only

--- 帖子 #1778 ---
I try to trade the pair that has the trend agreeing on all or most of the TF's

ie at the moment EURCHF is my hot pair

--- 帖子 #1779 ---
What is rh?

Harry

--- 帖子 #1780 ---
rh - righthand side

lh - lefthand side

--- 帖子 #1781 ---
i see, so you would be looking for any sort of sell opprtunity and signal on this pair?

--- 帖子 #1782 ---
yes , obviously thats the best pair but please trade on others that are nearly as good

ie we can see that EG was turning so not necessarily all TF were in agreement but , if you confident the 1 H 4 H is on the turn like it was this morning with the MOM then go for it

When I start trading I study all my charts for a good hour before my first trade

--- 帖子 #1783 ---
excellent, so if im looking correctly at this, also any sell signal on eur jpy would be good too?

--- 帖子 #1784 ---
some guy told me once..

if you ever not sure where the direction of the PA is on your chart.. go get your 5year old (if you don't have one borrow one) show the chart and ask him where the direction is..whatever he tell you that's your correct direction.

lol..

its really as simple as that..

--- 帖子 #1785 ---
Yep EJ is good to go , in fact any EUR is pretty good this morning

I have to admit one thing though , I am only using this system for alerting me to the MOM trades

but thats just my choice

--- 帖子 #1786 ---
ok im learning new stuff, which really will get me in better trades thanks guys.

One other thing so eur jpy for example, sells look good, but if a sell signal come now, even though price is below lower tma would u take the trade, or would you wait for price to retrace more towards the middle tma first?

--- 帖子 #1787 ---
so pete... for short, your forfeiting the PB to bands opposite side or at least to the mid band?

--- 帖子 #1788 ---
safer to wait for a retrace, at the very least one that pierces the lower band

the bigger the pierce, the safer the entry

hence when it goes to the opposite band it is normally a very good entry, unless of course you are unlucky and it is actually performing a trend change

--- 帖子 #1789 ---
thats understandble you will lose on a trend change sometimes, but theres far more retraces and moves continuing to outweigh those odd trend changes

--- 帖子 #1790 ---
also, i been looking but cant find it, i get an alert on every rf change regardless of stochs, i read somewhere in the thread of getting only alerts when rf change also matches with either/or 1hr or 4hr stoch?

--- 帖子 #1791 ---
short on cad Live...

--- 帖子 #1792 ---
correct , the thing with the hot pair , is you are gonna get less retracement signals if its so hot ,

this is where i would not use the rf signal but just look at pa to enter

--- 帖子 #1793 ---
there is quite a few

there is the 1-Retracement Finder by mediator - NOTE, this only checks the 60m stoch and has a bug in it where it checks for Stoch EMA on High/Low instead of Stoch LWMA on Close/Close

there is the !RF Double Stoch posted by me a few days ago, this only checks the stochs and RF

there is the !Retrace Finder posted by me yesterday (for this indi to work you need to have "TMA Called" in your MT4), this only alerts on the RF,Stochs AND TMA being in alignment

Paperclip can help you find them, instructions are there on the appropriate post as well.

--- 帖子 #1794 ---
haha thats what I use

my son looks at the chart  if its going up he will say , "daddy  we are making enough money to go on holiday yipeee"  or if its going down  he says "daddy  will we be able to go on holiday this year ??"

Thats my trend indicator

--- 帖子 #1795 ---
is eur chf lining up for anything now its moved up into the tmas?

--- 帖子 #1796 ---
there is no such thing as hot pair.. it can get cold in flash brother...

a descent measured PB is necessary to get back on the trend ride again and again ..

--- 帖子 #1797 ---
yeh if it gets to the upper tma , 1.20000, S1 level  - they are all together

look for a MOM down signalled by the RF finder but beware of NY open

This is purely MY opinion ok

UPDATE this is one you want to monitor cos it could be stopping at a fib level and the  middle tma

like I said , lack of signals on the  hotter pairs

I was in then out for a total of +8 pips- trade now closed

--- 帖子 #1798 ---
cheers dude, also same scenario in eurjpy too

--- 帖子 #1799 ---
well that eur chf gave a short RF signal, but 60min stoch was up, would you short or leave alone, obv considering the pair is in a obvious downtrend like you mentioned.

--- 帖子 #1800 ---
I did short it for +  8 pips - see my post above

--- 帖子 #1801 ---
i see, i dont really want to get into fib levels with this system yet, i just like to play by the rules of the system, and not have to worry about support/resistence fib levels etc.

--- 帖子 #1802 ---
No , I understand ,

There are so many levels and things

All I'd say is watch the candle formations to tell you where the levels are in relation to the system (WHICH IS BRILLIANT)

Yeh people question the TMA vs TMA true but that means nothing other than they think there are more opportunities than there really has been  in the past ,

I dont care , I make more opportunitoies by looking at more pairs

--- 帖子 #1803 ---
dont get me wrong, i done all my babypips training on levels etc, i even had a succesful period trading only support and resistence, but didnt last long, fib levels are all over the place sometimes as ppl see highs and lows differently. This why this system really took me in, because most my winners are purely from the system rules and some basic PA movement watching

--- 帖子 #1804 ---
Ah your  getting cofused with fib retracement levels

I meant fib pivot levels

Yeh forget about that fib retracement stuff

Waste of time  at the five minute level for me  , Never really bothered drawing all those silly lines on charts

its all self created by the fibbers themeselves

In fact if you took into account all levels fibs trends blah blah blah you would be too scared to set a trade in fear of reversal all the time

By the way AU is retracing well at the moment

Thats me finished for the day

back tomorrow morning byebye

--- 帖子 #1805 ---
ah i see, my bad.

anyway back to scanning, can anyone see any potential setups, im trying to cook my cheese toastie and watch charts at same time lol

--- 帖子 #1806 ---
Good evening Kevin and all the other guides to this thread - really appreciate the time you are giving.

Can someone please help on a minor point regarding the Stochastics indicator.

When the 4Hour stoch, and / or the 1 Hour stoch go either very overbought or oversold, they drop off the top / bottom of the screen, and I cant make out what they are doing.

Is there a way to rescale the axis which currently is 1 up to 100 - often if either of the stochs is less than 1 then I cant read.

Appreciate any guidance, and once again thanks for a great learning program

Cheers

i longed eurchf a min ago, price well below bottom tma, with 1hr and 4hr stochs showing up, is this a valid trade according to rules?

--- 帖子 #1812 ---
oooo risky ...I hope for you

keeping stop loss tight

--- 帖子 #1813 ---
i got burnt

what did i do wrong?

--- 帖子 #1814 ---
Not for much though ,right?

Just trending down so hard, difficult to fight that

moving on

--- 帖子 #1815 ---
suppose that should be obvious, my bad again.

where are your stochs on your chart?

--- 帖子 #1816 ---
I thought you were getting the idea, now you seem to have gone backwards

Why would you enter a long EURCHF

and don't say because the 4hr stoch turned upwards, just because the long term stoch terms upwards doesn't necessarily mean the trend has changed.

for instance, if the stoch goes up by 0.00001 greater than the previous it will be classed as upwards

Be EXTREMELY careful of stoch changes especially when in extreme OB/OS conditions

make sure the stoch has changed by some distance and for a number of bars

In your conversations with P.Porter you agreed the trend was down, nothing has changed since then.

The idea with the Up/Down indication is purely for help.  A computer does not care if it is 0.00001 greater than the previous or 50.00000 it classes both as UP.

--- 帖子 #1817 ---
yep huge mistake

but we or i even can take this as a positive learning curve. What i learnt is on the 5 min chart trend is clearly going down with lower highs etc so do not long even if all signals line up, am i in the ball park here?

--- 帖子 #1818 ---
This is applicable to ALL systems you try out, not just this one

just because the rules say to go long, look at what the PA is telling you

maybe in the trading systems thread we should ban the word "rules" and use "guidelines" instead

General -

Trying to catch the beginning of a trend change is extremely hard and you will be burnt 9 times out of 10

A trend once established will ALWAYS have at least one retracement where you can enter

For this method -

The thread is called retracement - if you don't have a retracement then you shouldn't be entering (and here I mean a PA retracement not the retracement finder indicator going red/blue/magenta.... whatever color)

The exception of course is with the short term band 2 band method when the market is ranging, because then it is just zig-zagging between the bands

--- 帖子 #1819 ---
congratulations docrock

what about 80 pips profit and this only from one pair....

the method has been really good on all pairs today (I've been having a blast with AU)

- Have no idea where Kevin is, maybe he got sick and tired of all the people coming on the thread and bashing it - without really understanding the principles behind it.

--- 帖子 #1820 ---
Hi docrock well done on your pips.

Any chance of getting that indicator that shows the three different time frames on the on time frame you have there?

Cheers

Hi,

I have been reading and looking at the system, however, it seems to really slug my machine.  Doers anyone else suffer this problem  i.e. slow performance.

--- 帖子 #1826 ---
hey guys, I hope im calling this a bit better than my lasy

trend is down from what i can see on this chart, price reached and went through upper tma, price come back a bit, rf signals sell and 4hr stoch is down aswell. Am i getting better lol?

http://i52.tinypic.com/16k76lt.jpg

--- 帖子 #1827 ---
well apart from the fact that I can't tell what currency it is yes that looks to be a standard mom trade

--- 帖子 #1828 ---
Hi Steve

2 indicators in the standard package are performance intensive

TMA - this could be replaced with TMA True

#MT Trendline - unless you really can't see when the trend is down / up (some basic explanations a few pages back of how to do this, including asking a 5 year old) this indicator is really not necessary

Regards

John

damn it, as soon as i pick the right setup according to rules, i picked the trend change ahhhh, o well -8pips is not too bad a hit for me

--- 帖子 #1833 ---
Thanks for the replies.  Its more likelythe indicators as my machine is reasonably tidy.

--- 帖子 #1834 ---
as that spike went across the board on all EUR crosses, I think you did well.

The trade was correct, but there must have been something released or on the news that sent the EUR shooting upwards (though I haven't seen what is was yet)

unexpected spikes happen, that is what SL's are for.

--- 帖子 #1835 ---
The problem is that the indi's are 'custom' indi's. Custom indis invariably consist of calls to standard indi's.

TMA With Distance, for example, makes several calls to other indicators. This happens at each tick over several charts. The system uses three custom indi's, so the cpu takes a hammering.

Mostly this is not a problem, but becomes one if you have much more going on in the background.

The solution is a brand-spanking new computer with the latest mega-memory and cpu that will blow a hole in warp-space.

No, I haven't got one either. Hey ho. I restrict myself to the 5 charts recommended by Kevin, so my machine keeps on running.

--- 帖子 #1836 ---
These charts are extremely relevant now lets add the next chart that shows the signals from this thread. Sorry your trades were losers just pointing out true PA. Wasn't trying to offend anyone. For the new traders you can't take trades off the signals alone have to understand PA a little. Now the 3rd chart price at top of tma and hitting bottom of the price it just broke and down she goes and entry would have been the RF signal text book short.

--- 帖子 #1837 ---
Turbo,

What , uh, can you elaborate...

You lost me

anyone up and about spotting any setups, i like to trade a couple hours of the asian

--- 帖子 #1839 ---
Hi,

USD/CAD looks like a possible setup for short?

--- 帖子 #1840 ---
yes i spotted that i got too eager and entered on a quick down rf bar appearing, i pulled out at -11 pips, now waiting for it to go higher maybe for rentry?

also take a look at eur chf for a possible long?

--- 帖子 #1841 ---
i think you're right. but asian market really doesn't shift the candle stick as much as they do during the US market. Think I'll just sit out for asian market.

--- 帖子 #1842 ---
just got stop out of USD/CAD for -6pips.

--- 帖子 #1843 ---
where did u enter, as i didnt see any down rf bar after my entry ?

--- 帖子 #1844 ---
oops i should have waited for the rf bar to appear before I enter. Guess I was too eager and entered once the price touches the top of TMA

--- 帖子 #1845 ---
All pretty quiet this morning

--- 帖子 #1846 ---
the market will stay noisy and slow due the end of the QE2 next week

--- 帖子 #1847 ---
Steve, I am experiencing the same problem. This system seems to use a large amount of my CPU power; up to 80 or 90%. It's a hog but have several successful trades with it, so far.

--- 帖子 #1848 ---
i have 6 mt4 loaded up 2 fxpros and 4 alparis, one of which is my live account, i do notice cpu slowdown etc, they all use hell alot of resources, but i dont really notice it as my comp is more than capable power wise.

EURUSD - buy

both stochs up, initial target upper band

EDIT:  Price was unable to hold the break of the middle line

stopped out -19.6 pips

first loss this week.. (although missed a lot of the trading week with technical issues)

--- 帖子 #1851 ---
now i understand the 4hr being different for some people coz of timezones on brokers, but my 1hr is showing down on eur usd

on another note, i bought aud usd according to mom rules, aiming for upper band

--- 帖子 #1852 ---
I personally use 30m not 1hr

--- 帖子 #1853 ---
ah that would explain it. i started off well, but losing quite alot of pips past couple of days, i must be making some beginner errors somewhere.

Im in a long aud usd which is around 8 pips in profit, aiing for upper band

update - audusd now down to 1pip profit only, what do u suggest bail out or wait?

--- 帖子 #1854 ---
your AU trade looks to have the same problem my EU trade had (updated the previous post)

unable to hold the break of the middle line

this where you must decide to hold or let it stop out

though if you look at the 4h stoch, although up there has been next to no movement in the last hours

--- 帖子 #1855 ---
thanks, im learning slowly and i see what you mean, so i pulled out for +1.7

lets look for more

--- 帖子 #1856 ---
hoping for a usdcad long soon, what do u think?

--- 帖子 #1857 ---
DAMMMMMMMM

this is where have certain hard rules can go against you

I never use more than a 20pip stop, sometimes less depending on the swing low

EURUSD trade (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post4723689)

If i had placed my stop at the swing low (which would have meant a 29pip stop), not only would my trade have survived but hit it's take profit

This is why correct placement of stops is important, maybe my 20pip rule will not work with this method

and either - don't take a trade when sl would be more than 20pips or get rid of my max sl rule altogether.

decisions, decisions

--- 帖子 #1858 ---
SL is v important i think, always below or above swings, i dont use a hard set amount i always set sl by what price is telling me, in this case it would of helped you no end anyway im still looking at eurjpy and usd cad

66trader66

I went through this 100% usage some time ago and changed to a different MT4 broker for my charts and found that cured the problem.

Interbank opened at the same time with either FxPro or Alpari charts chewed up resources, so much so that constantly the usage was 100% (drove me crazy) yet GoMarkets charts with either of the three named charts doesn't...............go figure.

I like having two different charts open at the same time as I find it easier to pick up gaps in data.

Di

--- 帖子 #1860 ---
true,

I also noticed i made another mistake in placing that order, high impact news being released

p.s. i have a sellstop waiting on ej at the mid-line

--- 帖子 #1861 ---
why a sell stop and also why on mid line

i thought we entered on or either the rf candle direction ?

--- 帖子 #1862 ---
Watching with interest

not much going on, hard to not pull the trigger, eh

--- 帖子 #1863 ---
I use a similar method of entry to P.Dean

I find what i believe is the trigger candle, (sometimes via RF Finder but not always) and then enter usually with a buy/sell stop with a buffer.

helps avoid false breaks.

I have been lurking on here for a while. I have been trading this system.... along with some of my own personal tweaks, thus the lack of me posting in effort to not adding to the derailment of this thread.

But I have to tell you. This is bar-none THE best counter-trend trading system that I have ever traded with. Will not go into the details because of the above mention fear of derailment, but it is fantastic.

Lohad

--- 帖子 #1883 ---
so you trade against the trend?

--- 帖子 #1884 ---
I trade with the trend as my prime focus, but this system gives too good of signals of counter-trend to pass up.

--- 帖子 #1885 ---
please share, i know kevinator doesnt want changes but i like to learn from everybody, as kevinator said the base will always remain the same

--- 帖子 #1886 ---
Cheers,

Does anybody experience problems with stochastic changing its mind? I'm giving this system a try in the next couple of weeks.

I'm not trying to derail the system with my personal efforts to eliminate false signals thus this is a quick screen shot showing QQE confirming the short term movement as this seems to not repaint so far. I still need some more screen time to confirm though.

Please note: this is only my effort to combat the stoch mind change.

Have a lot of pips.

--- 帖子 #1887 ---
Anyone have aMulti TF Retracement indicator please

--- 帖子 #1888 ---
I just Longed for a quick pips in less than a minute as QQE gave a fast signal for an uptrend. No drawdown!

The RF was showing retracement and a the trade was from the low of a TMA.

Should have easily kept it but chickened out.

Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #1889 ---
i saw this, didnt enter as the TMA lines are clearly showing a down trend, i learnt the hard way yesterday trading against the slope. But still well done on the easy pips my friend

--- 帖子 #1890 ---
i will be entering short here on EUR GBP, when rf finder tells me to

update: 1hr stochs has now just started to point down too

--- 帖子 #1894 ---
Trying not to be just a lurker here.  I was watching this setup after you pointed it out.  My concern is that the rf indicator to short came so late that price was already nearing the center of the TMA.  Considering the momentum of the preceding rise from the bottom to the top of the TMA, I tend to fear a change of trend happening - although as I type this, the move appears to continue in favor of your trade.  I will continue to watch.

--- 帖子 #1895 ---
im just following the hard rules set in place, all what you say is true, but it has touched out just crossed outside the top tma, and as long as it is not past middle tma downwards when rf signals its all good for me, if it was crossed the middle tma line already when rf signalled i would have not taken it, currently im up 4.4 pips, fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #1896 ---
John, would you mind posting a larger screenshot or post the settings for both the Ultra Stochs you've overlayed in your bottom window? Cant quite make out the setting for the second stoch in the chart.

So is it more reliable to use the Ultra stoch compared with say the Kevinator one that repaints? Does your version take care of the repainting issue?

Thanks for your time and effort mate

--- 帖子 #1897 ---
Hi Ral1n, Yr chart looks interested, can you upload the blue/red dot indicator on your chart ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1898 ---
Hi WilteredFire

2nd settings are the standard ones for the 4hr in this method

ie. 10,3,3,LWMA,Close/Close

Ultra Stoch has NO repainting (except of course for the current open 5m bar) - therefore is far more accurate and gives you a true indication of what the 4hr stoch has been doing during each 4hr period.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1899 ---
Only 1 trade for me this morning.I didn't have the h1 or h4 in my favor the h4 was green at the time but reason for the short was how far price was out of the TMA lines. It was also hitting a supply zone as well so was comfortable with the trade. Would have posted this morning but took this 1 minute before walking out the door for work.

--- 帖子 #1900 ---
JMW could you possibly make the TMA true have the distance pips in it. I like the looks of it better as no repaint and really like the distance pips very nice feature.Thanks

Hey,

I am afraid the author of this thread does not approbate any changes to the system and since he's the manager up here I would like not to upload anything that is not specified to the rules.

I can only tell you, that this is a regular QQE MTF (you can find on google easily) with cross alert turned on (the dots) set on M15 with smoothing varying from 3 up to 30 depending on market volatility. It is not a fixed settings because there are times you need a quicker entry signal confirmation as the market consolidates. It is up to you how you will adjust the smoothing and the time frame. H1 and M15 on M5 looked good so far. I need a couple of weeks to be able to say that this approach works though.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #1904 ---
Ral1n, can to upload the QQE sistem?

Thanks.

good system so far.

11 trades total today, all MOM trades.

10/11 are losses, down about $400 real. great system.

I'll keep going but at this rate I'll blow up my account in a week.

--- 帖子 #1909 ---
3 trades, 3 winners for me since Frankie open.  I have not posted as I am trying to tweak entries, just took small profits.  I'm considering going back to old retracement finder as the Double Stoch alert seems to give very late entries.

To post above, I would suggest you review rules for MOM trades.

This forum seems so quite this few days, moreover where is kevinator

A trade i took

--- 帖子 #1911 ---
Hiya cav01

You are trading in a ranging market - Monday

Although (by the book) they are MOM's you still need  atrend for an MOM to work

Thats the key to success , spotting the trend early

You can do the scalping trades on the bounce nbut I personally dont have the patience to watch bounces all day

--- 帖子 #1912 ---
Thanks.

Is it important to have the TMA sloped up/down and not sideways?

Also, I'm only using the 240 stoch but i'm find repainting to be a problem with this indicator.

Backtesting cant be trusted with this system.

--- 帖子 #1913 ---
Go to be honest and saythat most of the systems  give the same signals in a different sort of way ,

Becuase of this I use the indies like retracement and tma in conjunction with other ones like Lawgirl trendfinder, TMS, QQE, stochs all helping to spot the trend

Yes the angle of the TMA helps on the immediate  trend

I try to spot the hot pair (trending pair) and use that for my trades so if I do dodgy trades Ive got a "get out of jail free" card hopefully

hot at the mom is USDCHF but obviousy trends can end  (especially on the 5m)

EU trend up will turn either in the NY session or tomorrow

--- 帖子 #1914 ---
Where is the Manager? This thread is going astray.

Nothing special got in (shorted) - waited 20 minutes and finally exit at BE since no action is present. No loss no win. Could have taken 2 pips but missed by 10 seconds after exit.

Can anyone point me to the post, or explain the criteria that triggers the different types of alert. I know they are a heads up, I just want to know the criteria that causes the alert to trigger...

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1917 ---
havnt had a chance to trade this yet but looks like if you only traded on the pull backs that went past all the tms line on eur/usd today and went long with the 4hr and 1 hr stochs working together you would have made a ton of pips! just wish i cld get a day off from work to trade it as this system looks great. The problem i see from reading peoples posts is that they are trading every move. just wait for the best set ups. on eur/usd alone you cld get 2-3 perfect set ups a day.

--- 帖子 #1918 ---
in hindsight yes!!

but in real time no!

i been trading the eur usd all day on this system not once did it touch opposite tma with the 4 hr stoch in agrrement let alone the 1hr, yes a little while later i look back and it touched the opposite tma loads of times making it look like ive missed out on loads of pips, but the repainting is misleading.

--- 帖子 #1919 ---
Ahh, I see. will take note. need to spend a day at home watching in real time. Is this working for anyone other than kevin then?

--- 帖子 #1920 ---
not for me unfortunately, i got a few good trades but im down overall, i can see the potential thought mixing it with a little PA etc, but kevin said, leave it AS IS!! and it will work, so thats what i did and am doing

i missed that one too

Could you possibly make the TMA true have the distance numbers in it thanks. Actually just noticed you already have done it on your is there anyway I could get the TMA and the Ultra stoch from you. I like the way your charts setup is thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1926 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #1927 ---
It's VERY rare to find a straight up technical system that works great as a stand alone system, think about it for a minute - what if our system is giving us an alert to buy right in an area where "the big boys" are unloading their inventory, who's going to win that trade - your $20 or their $20M ?

If you do learn some price action (most importantly supply/demand) then you will be able to see where the pros have a lot of orders in (just waiting) to buy or sell at certain levels. Then you can position yourself in the right direction and scalp all day long with this awesome short-term market timing system.

That's my approach and it's going great, I'm really pleased with this method's ability to time and show exactly where the entrances and exits are.

To learn the supply and demand, I recommend to watch all of these webinars and study them, it will pay off big.

--- 帖子 #1928 ---
sorry what are you basically saying here, that this kevnator system is or is not good for what you just said?

--- 帖子 #1929 ---
If you read what I said again, I think it's articulated pretty well.

Most people are looking for forex easy millions, ,  go find a professional who trades for a living and ask if he uses a "blind technical method" to trade.

I'm sure it's possible to trade a pure technical method with success, if you find a strategy that works like this please pm me as I would love to see it.

Personally I would rather kill the markets by knowing how it really works then have all the ups and downs trading "blind".  If it works great blind, then let's make an ea.

--- 帖子 #1933 ---
Hi HappyHappy/All

just watched a few of the webinars, one that was VERY interesting when combined with this method is the one on CCI & Stochastics.

In the original rules of this method we enter on after the first bar in the Retrace Finder in the direction of our trade, ie. for long the first bar where the CCI was greater than 0, for short the first bar where the CCI was less than 0

In the webinar he mentions using CCI & Stochs (either one works) and using the "turn" (although it is easier to see on the stochs as you also have the signal line)

This combats the problem I have often found that by the time the CCI confirms the trade, the price is often past the mid-line which makes for a riskier trade.

However the important  point to note is, that it is very important which OB/OS signals to take (he uses +100/-100 for OB/OS on CCI)

so in this method for MOM trades if the 4hr stoch is up, then you only take OS signals, 4hr stoch down only take OB signals.

As I have non-repainting versions of all indicators I have visually looked and the signals generated are usually 1 to 2 candles earlier, which means

a) less problems with the mid-line

b) reduced risk on SL as you are entering sooner after the swing low/high

As it's quite late here, will be running thru a full forward test tomorrow for MOM trades only.

I will post a report on my findings (as the only true method of testing is forward testing)

Best Regards

John

--- 帖子 #1934 ---
i look forward to your findings, and appreciate the time and effort your willing to spend forward testing while also sharing with others

--- 帖子 #1935 ---
I take some if it looks like things are moving, if it's quiet I don't.

I'm in this one, working out good so far.

For those that are interested, how I do this is I have my "timing chart" on top and my "what's happening today" chart on the bottom (not always so zoomed in).  We can see with the e/g "what's happening chart" that price just took out the high and on the "timing chart" a nice double top with both 1h and 4h ("bias helpers") showing down.  I also have another screen which has daily charts so I make sure that I'm not missing anything.

(so I'm aware of the Daily but take trades based on the 1H using Kevinator as my market timing for ins and outs)

Lovin it!

Hey John,

We're so conditioned to use indicators as our guides, I've found that they can screw us up much more then they help by giving us false confidence. Once you learn the supply and demand and get some real confidence in your trades, then they can be very helpful for your timing. I can trade totally naked now but I wouldn't get as many trades as I do using this method to help time and show clear ins and outs.

--- 帖子 #1937 ---
This is a nice trade I took earlier today on the cad, after it broke the steepest trendline I was waiting for the retrace to sell it again which is where I've put the arrows.

--- 帖子 #1938 ---
FYI, the Retracement Finder indicator is nothing more that a CCI(8) converted to a Histogram indicator where it signals the turn from <= 0 to > 0 for a Long signal or the turn from >= 0 to < 0 for a Short signal.

Still a useful indicator if you don't want to hurt your eyes looking at the normal CCI(8) indicator

Happy,

I like your approach to this method of trading and appreciate your contribution, especially regarding the supply and demand. I am sure that is the only way to add to this method. It only adds to our knowledge of how and when the market moves and thereby exploiting, as it were, the market.
Keep up your contribution as long as you are able.

Good trading to all!!!!

hi happy and all,

listen brother... just live trade what and all that you know,and less talk.. with respect..

nothing is for certain.. you won't be able to read big boys next move by just chart trading.. chart trading is a secondarily way of trading.. and you and I and we know nothing unless we are one of the insiders or the actual big guns... supply and demand will go opposite or for anytime as wished to do whats right for them.. mass of cash will change any god damn s/p  s/r  etc, line on yours and my chart..

the best is to not worship whats laid on the chart but to see the true PA ,use other stuff just as compliments and figure out when they make sense to the actual action at hand..  in here we use some indies as guides but they don't and should not rule what we do.. 2/3 of all alert signals are to be eliminated and scanned.. indies help somewhat to scan quicker in the heat of the daily battle when filliping pages..

no matter where the s/p lines are or are not.. when PA is ranging.. the damn thing is ranging and if the channel is wide enough one might be able to put up some ping pong action.. and if it's Trending than, where better to get in than MOM setup.. that's your real buying cheap selling high or opposite .. and more importantly if it goes wrong your sl as a back up is not too far from entry to keep the avg loss in-check.

to everyone,

for this system there is one thing vital before putting up a trade..

is the currency pair in RANGE.. or.. TRENDING.. action

what helps you with that?.. it's simple..

daily range.. the band's angel.. current swing.. and then the 4hr stoach..

know this little thing before doing any action..

if it ranging, ping pong it ass.. if it's trending, wait for MOM..

--- 帖子 #1945 ---
char display that you might find helpful..

--- 帖子 #1946 ---
I took this long trade too, the 4h stoch showed down so it wasn't a normal valid entry. I took it anyways as I saw price had broken the 1h trendline to the downside and the Euro and GBP had just bounced hard to the upside, so I guessed correctly it was going to stop out all the shorts which it did. (and got 30 pips

I agree with some of what you said, when you know it's in a range, ping pong baby! Also, about how we want to eliminate many of the signals.

Re: your current view on supply and demand, here's my response "you don't know what you don't know".

I've shared a bit as I had a couple people pm asking me for my view on things and don't worry, I'm not planning to stick around the forum for too long so I hope that people get some value while I'm here. It's a fluke/synchronicity that brought me here.

Re: your live charts - seriously, who cares, those can be live demo charts.

Peace and good luck.

PS  IMHO if you keep "trading blind" I'll be taking some of your money

Ok, I was very skeptical to short round numbers so I just standed by and watched whether it is a bullish flag or some deeper retracement.

The RF was stepping down, H4 stoch was down and QQE was giving me some calls.

--- 帖子 #1951 ---
G/U live...  sorry to put this up late... i was making a reply back post..

now about the setup and trade..

this pair in my eyes is in the range action about 60 pips daily range.. as you see at the time of entry the 4hr is flashing down but the fact is, its not strong.. the 1hr, not even flashing down..  so.. the indies are too inline... but the real action says that the damn thing is in the RANGE... so all i got to do is to play the bands and sell on top and buy in the bottom till it releases out of this range...

--- 帖子 #1952 ---
The exit should be according to the rules at the lower of TMA.

It's wise to lock in profit after some pips go in your favour though. I know that there are time price likes to retrace making drawdown but anyway I hate taking heat so I would just move the SL @ BE after 5pips in profit.

--- 帖子 #1953 ---
I've been reading this thread since the weekend and decided to set up a demo yesterday and take some trades.

Yesterday, lots of wins, but losses also from poor entries so will continue to read and check the charts being posted.

I have taken a couple of trades tonight with nice results, eurusd (25 pips) and usd cad (10 pips). I exited far too early on the usdcad trade which is still going up.

At the moment I'm just concentrating on the MOM trades till I get the hang of the strategy, however have been using a stop loss that has been a bit tight I think. I've been stopped out quite a few times to have the price go in my direction like a bullet on the next candle.

--- 帖子 #1954 ---
exited a few seconds after the snap shot for +47..

now looking to see if I can pull MOM trade out of this since its swinging down, 4hr coming around to bearish as well as 30min.. now waiting for a valid PB close to Upper band... at the same time I do not yet consider this pair as a trending pair at moment.. but since it broke the days low and moved to bigger daily range I would be a bit more careful on buy signals and scan much more carefully and definitely pass on the first buy signal..

--- 帖子 #1955 ---
nice trades  fxozgirl.. and welcome to the thread..

--- 帖子 #1956 ---
Thanks P. Dean....

I have enjoyed reading your posts, you're doing very well with the strategy.

I am only about 20 pages into the thread, but wanted to get a few trades happening so I can watch while I'm reading

Thanks to Kevinator too, for sharing this system

--- 帖子 #1957 ---
for me no any trade yet cuz no any clear direction, market is  range, flat.

--- 帖子 #1958 ---
Geo,

the sound point of this strategy style of trading is that you can take advantage of the market in its ranging and trending condition..  remember most times market is ranging or is at least direction less.. so to be successful IMHO one needs to know how to pull profit from both conditions to be a versatile trader.

Hello, I've just finished reading this thread, spent 2 weeks for it.

Hi P.Dean, would you mind to explain to me how you get out for -7? because i took the same trade and out for -44 pips stoploss. i don't have any clear strategy for my stoploss. I'd appreciate your advice on this.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #1962 ---
I was getting ready for lunch when I saw the first screen - it looked so so, I mean not good and not bad either. Made a long entry - and was catastrophic - London lunch time and effort to catch the very beginning of the next movement. I did'nt realise the Stochs were pointing down. I got my ass beaten. I was hoping for 1.2.3. to develop and pop in the wave.

I came back from lunch and got in for long again, took a lot of heat and seeing the bullish divergence decided to give it a try. Made 23 pips, took profit at .4300.

To recap. It is not always wise to get in as soon as potential signal is appearing. ...

I apologize for the hindsight charts but since I'm not a full time trader and work for an institution so it's kinda tricky to do both.

Will also try to post live as possible.

EDIT: There is one issue with QQE.

It does not repaint at all since the dots become visible. However... however... When you try to refresh the indi let's say you want to change color of the line or recall the indicator to see the settings and click OK - it changes position afterwards, recalculating after some candles appear.

So there are potential losses but hence we use the TMA, RF and the Stochastics it can yield some good/excellent results.

Ohhh, btw. I don't think I will enter the market in between London break again.

Hi Geobull

this is not according to any of the trading methods being used here.

Price is already at the OB TMA, for long, price should be at least below the mid-TMA, the other parts of the rules you got correct.

You may be lucky though...

BREAKING NEWS:- JMW1970 has been found guilty of wanton neglect in respect to the sacred laws of Forex trading - Sentenced to an ass-kicking in the market.... more to follow

--- 帖子 #1966 ---
Hey I'm right there in the jail cell with you...

--- 帖子 #1967 ---
A little clarification:-

I normally am not able to trade early in the week due to other commitments, therefore when using this system profitably in the last few weeks it has always been towards the end of the week, by which time the market was generally in an easily definable trend.

Therefore when previously trading I quite simply did not bother with the "shorter" term method which is more suited to ranging / breakout type markets.

Today (and yesterday) were more of what I term as range / breakout days, for a while they moved sideways (or slightly down/up) then suddenly exploded in a direction.

As I haven't been using the "shorter" term method available, I simply tried to trade today using MOM definitions, which didn't work and the market summarily kicked my ass.

Hence being found guilty of wanton neglect - the trading methodology here has two methods - I was guilty of trying to use the wrong method in the wrong market type.

Sometimes it's good to get your ass kicked, it makes the lesson easier to remember....

--- 帖子 #1968 ---
jmw1970,

Could you please confirm that these are the non re-painting indi's that you are using and if not could you be so kind to post your tpl.....

Also in your charts i see the up/down indication for the stoch in the upper right corner of chart,how can i display that?

Thanks for all your efforts here

--- 帖子 #1969 ---
Hi Omi

yes those are the correct non-repainting indicators

the arrows in the top r/h of screen are not part of this method, they are part of some experimental code I am testing out on trend detection based on HH/HL LL/LH.

No valid long trades w/system atm

UPDATE: Where would you be long on euro or gu? Both 1hr and 4hr stochs down, price in middle of TMA for over and hour. Trichet to speak very soon.

--- 帖子 #1974 ---
must be broker differences, on mine both eu & gu show 4hr stoch as up

--- 帖子 #1975 ---
I would not cite this as broker differences. I watch feeds from 2 differents brokers, GCI and FXCM, both were down at the time. However, and this is a gray area of the system, both my 1hr and 4hr are now repainted as up. Still, based upon time of day, and where retracement signal crossed zero, I would not have taken a long, even though several other sources have vouched for longs.

Unfortunately, most of the examples given for the system are in a clearly trending market. Lately, the market has been chop, and one is apt to find a reversal of trends every 6-8 hours.

--- 帖子 #1976 ---
Hi Longfellow

this is why I switched to non-repainting versions of all the indicators, I was getting myself confused especially on the 4hr with it switching between up & down (usually when in extreme OB/OS)

--- 帖子 #1988 ---
Hi J,

yes.. several mistakes..

One for most..  this pair is and was at the time of your entry in a super range mood (under 30 daily range).. you need enough room to even play ping pong.. lol

Two.. super narrow band.. not enough to get in and get out for good enough profit, if and when it does go in your direction considering the spread and the buffer (which is wise to use) to come out ahead at the end.

Three.. your entry is close to the bottom of the band.. this kind of signals should be filtered..

and Forth.. and this is only a recommendation..

try to wait for the RF bar candle to close before entry... it will save you a lot of false breaks.. this is what i do.. you don't have to do it.

sure it will result in some later entry or miss the signal.. but in other hand it will save you a lot of quick turnaround loss that leaves a super sour test.. you all know what I mean.. lol

oh forgot the last one... don't even bother with this pair.. it's historically a volatile-less pair.. I just keep eye on it for fun thou.. lol

I hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #1989 ---
I like your sence of humour!

--- 帖子 #1990 ---
Hi All

don't know if this helps anyone else, but for me I find it useful,

I ignore the direction/colors of the 4hr stoch once it is in OB/OS

I just assume that while it remains in OB it is bullish, OS it is bearish

Reason being is that we are looking at the 4hr stoch on a 5m timeframe, it can remain in OB/OS for a longgggg time, just because it has move slightly down / up, while it is on the OB/OS zone doesn't necessarily mean the trend has changed.

Of course once it is out of these zones then the color/direction matters.

Just my observation of course, for me it's helped.

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1991 ---
And another thing.... (while I am imparting my somewhat dubious insights)

Yesterday for ME was a terrible day, I couldn't get a trade correct if my life depended on it, and I managed to blow thru some 160 pips in losses.

In fact yesterday alone I had more losers than I have had in the previous 3 weeks.

However, that being said, I am still nicely in profit

somedays the system won't work / or you manage to take every false signal (and like all systems this produces a few)

Everything must be taken into consideration - don't discard a system just because you have a bad day.

(Although for me this is somewhat easier as I have had profitable days upto yesterday, so one losing day not a problem, if it's your first day trading the system and you get such a loser I can understand being less inclined to trust the methodology)

Here's hoping for brighter end to the week than the beginning.

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1992 ---

Hi all,

I am looking for an alert mtf indicator, giving buy and sell signals only based on the stochastic.

Preferably to the attached indicator, which is the indicator showing in the screenshots of Kevin's very first posts.

Thanks a lot.

http://content.screencast.com/users/...06-29_1834.png

--- 帖子 #1998 ---
Hi Johntan

it is not a must, but gives you less risk.

The TMA bands can be thought of as another oscillator

the upper band is Overbought, the lower band is Oversold

General rule of thumb for oscillators is you try to buy close to oversold, sell close to overbought

A lot of people use the mid-line of the TMA as the latest possible risk, although be aware in strongly trending markets the price may not retrace to even the mid-line.

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #1999 ---
In the attached screenshots I added an arrow where stochastic went from sell to buy/ vice versa.

Is there an indicator which gives an alert when that happens?

(I don't mean each step up or down, just when stoch changes to buy or sell)

--- 帖子 #2000 ---
There is no must in trading.. in fact in my opinion the road to success depends on flexibility.. but that's whole story of it's own.

now the bands... just a lower/upper band or OB or OS of the band don't mean entry.. other matters to consider..

-the angel of the current direction of the band is important..

-knowing weather the pair is in a ranging or trending mood..

-awareness of daily range at all times..

keep these also in mind before entering..

for example.. today most major pairs are in a bullish slow moving shape.. and it's constantly giving short trade signals... but with the points that i provided above, one can get into less or maybe no trouble..

I have had one trade today and that was bullish half ass MOM trade on A/U and even that was so slow moving that i got out for +9 pips after hours it could have been in +40 profit.. not worth the wait and risk maybe.

anyways, I hope I answered you question.

--- 帖子 #2001 ---
Hi John,

Sorry to hear about your loss.. but like you said.. one bad day it's not a problem and you will bounce back, I am sure of it..

I have learned to get up, lick my wounds and move on from such days.

I know you will kill it in the near feature.

best of luck.

--- 帖子 #2002 ---
Hi Globalinvest

the problem is the indicator you are basing your alert on.

the color stochastic indicator you attached, simply compares the current stochastic value with the previous, and paints all lines in that time period with the same value.

so in theory on an hourly stoch the following could happen

open of the hour, stoch is up

15m into the hour, stoch is down

30m into the hour, stoch is equal

45m into the hour stoch is up again

on the indicator you are using all you would see is the final value, which is up, but during the hour it went down then back up,

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #2005 ---
hi jmw, mind to tell what trigger buy?

cos CCI oversold?

my screen look like below.

--- 帖子 #2006 ---
I used a slightly different trigger to enter

basically for me the trend was up, so as soon as the CCI went into Oversold, I bought on the very next candle at open

this is an early entry, that Kevin uses occasionally, basically pre-empting the official trigger (it helps to cut down on initial drawdown, BUT BEWARE can also give catastrophic losses if this is a trend change).

--- 帖子 #2009 ---
I think I understand what your are trying to say, but I intend to use this indicator (period 60 or 240) on the 5 minute chart as described in the first post by Kevin. For longer term trends, not scalping.

The indicator does change on the 5min chart, not once an hour and "seems" reliable. Maybe I didn't get your point???

--- 帖子 #2010 ---
yeah, I think you missed the point I was trying to make

this indicator repaints the current bar (like all indicator) - but remember this is the current bar on the other timeframe

so my example again of 1hr MTF stoch, on a 5m chart

12 5m bars make up the hour

so when it repaints the current bar on the MTF timeframe, it can repaint upto 11 candles back on the 5m

only when the hour bar is closed, is the 12 5m candles that make up that bar not repainted anymore.

--- 帖子 #2011 ---
Ok. Thank you. Got it.

Haven't watched the indicator long enough to see if it repaints or not.

Here is the entry for longterm trades off the 1st post by kevin:

" LONGTERM

You can either enter the market (long term) when the mtf stochastics is  changing directions and hold until trend is done or at any of the  retracement bars going in the direction of the trend and hold  (20-400pips)"

So, has there been a change as to what indicators to use for this trading concept, rather than the scalping?

Can you recommend a mtf stoch with alert, nonrepainting, one could use for longer trends?

--- 帖子 #2012 ---
The concept remains the same

I don't know of any non-repainting MTF Stochastics with an Alert

Almost all MTF indicators generally have this same issue with the repaint.

I use non-repainting MTF Stochs, but there is no alert.

What settings in your indicator QQE

--- 帖子 #2015 ---
That depends... usually or to say most of a time it's set to 60 (time frame H1) and the smoothing to 6. Don't refresh the indi itself though or the dots will be moved. It kinda repaints only if chart is refreshed.

I am working on Donchian channel right now so I can see any value added.

don't hope rock.. life goes on.. people move on based on their own agenda..

apperciated whats laid out and  add what you find useful to your trading arsenal.

you all think there is much else he can show?.. i would say No..

he showed the setup entry for both ranging and trending market.. now what's left is to be actually present for each and every valid signal through the scanning.. that's you and I and everyone else's part.

I hope this post puts to rest the "Kevin coming back" issue.. lol

however before I end this post.. one thing is so amusing to me.. and that is... we don't get to see the so called "legends of FF" with their +10v to come in and help out or carry on when the thread founder is not here.. but their all are so quick to come in when he is present and operating just to throw rocks and sarcasm in their own sneaky evil ways..  I find it too funny.

anyways, it's time for you all to carry on if you find this system useful.. live trade your performance and only good things could come out of it.. either you get help from others when you make mistake or help others with displaying your skill based on live execution.. that's hell'ev a lot worth more than +10voucher with nothing to show but hide behind the big +V... trust me when i tell you.

best of luck to all.

Oh Thank you very much Dean!

To me this system has a lot of merit. However it is some 10 days since Kevinator was here. I hope he is well and I thank him for bringing this to our attention.

In the interests of people still interested in this sytem and not wanting to bastardised the Kevinator's original thread, is it a sensible idea to start ask  jmw1970 (John) to start a spin-off thread? I suggest John because of his invaluable work in contributing various indicators. This new thread would allow him the ability to alter the first post of the thread and as such place and alter from time to time, all the current indicators in that post.

Dean, you mentioned that Kevinator would be back this week. Are you in private contact with him? (PS.......................I've been waiting for the revved up Dean to show us 100 pips a day on this method).

Just my thoughts.

I have displayed a chart from yesterdays A/U action..  as you all see it was in a slow bullish move all day.. which it did not give us the perfect mom setup while it was moving on with momentum behind it..

so the problem is.. at times it does not come in although way to make a opposite band touch before releasing with energy for possible profit..

so i recommend.. when you see such PA... disregard the band only if you got the 3 points below in line..

watch the chart..

disregard the perfect band touch.. if:

1) both 4hr and 1hr (30m) are in the same direction

2) CCI to be OS on buy  and OB on sell..(this could be the substitute of band for you in this case only)

3) when you got a minimum +10 pips gap between your entry point based of RF to HH/LL..

if these three criteria is meet.. go for it regardless of the Price touching the opposite band.. all you need is a good enough PB to get on such rides.

this past week I personally made a lot of positive pips on such plays..   the important point in the MOM trade is that the MOMENTUM is there.. if yes..than don't let the arrival of perfect setup to stand in your way of profitability.

I hope it helps you out.

--- 帖子 #2030 ---
your right DI.. this is a pure example of words not meeting the action..lol.. my apology.. however as you may recall that post i had also mentioned that i am not emotionally well tuned over my loss yet.. I am here but it's like I am not here.. so i have to really push myself.. i hope you know what i mean.  not to mention that making trades is one thing but showing each and everyone of them is another thing.. it needs fast hands, mind and all..lol.. but once i am up to it its not a biggy for me.

also on other hand.. i thought Kevin will be here as well to watch over things.. after all he is the thread founder and he has the full control of the thread to deal properly with the trolls and so forth.. I was in contact with Kevin up to 10 days ago and i just assumed that he is just taking a few days or a week off and he'll return.. now I don't know since i have not heard of him for over a week.

also.. market has been a ass too.. lol.. I think most of you might concur with me on this. One of traders best asset is to not force a trade when it's not quiet there.. so that also may have been the reason for my low activity.

I second your suggestion, it's not a bad idea.

regards,

Dean

USDCAD - Sell

(ignore the fib, just there for me to measure the retrace)

--- 帖子 #2032 ---
hi John,

I would have rejected this signal for two reasons regardless of out come..

1) the pair is super range all day up to now..

2) the current band is too narrow for potential profit in between..

that's just me though..

--- 帖子 #2033 ---
Hi Dean,

how wide the band need to be before you consider enough profit can be taken?

--- 帖子 #2034 ---
no set in stone number... but wide and range enough to make up the spread and plus minimum of +10 pips potential profit..

if i see the pair is in bigger daily range I may ignore the bands width but if i see ranging pair and narrow band.. i stay away from it

--- 帖子 #2035 ---
that's the problem with auto rescaling on MT4 - the bands can look wide but not many pips

maybe I need to modify the TMA xxx with Distances to display somewhere the total width of the band

what do you think??

though of course standard retracement theory is that it should at least go to the original point of the retracement - and in some thinking it should go to the original + the retracement (the last one did)

I'll leave the fib on after i close the order to see how much of that holds true.

--- 帖子 #2036 ---
I froze this picture to show how a trader should be better than his indicators at times and see the true action..

as you all see everything looks like a perfect MOM setup to be made..

but to me this one is a trap..

sure the pair is trending.. sure it has pulled back.. sure it had touch the opposite band.. sure the stochs are in-lined well enough..

but.. the pair simply has got exhausted  because of the one way street release of energy all at once for a +130pips move straight.. so the release of energy may not be there for such MOM setups and most likely will turn into a fake out..

the right move on this pair was earlier today from the get go inside the band... i was in it and decided to take the money at the touch of the lower band.. but since it was a strong break it was worth to keep it for longer and bigger profit.. it could not turn any better this.

price will tell you the true picture of the action.. one must distinguish when and where his beloved indicators will fail him.

this is just my views.. do and take out, what makes sense to you.

USDCAD - 11 pips

couldn't hold past the original low point of the retracement (and I was having bad connection issues)

Plus - major news coming on both currencies soon so exited

--- 帖子 #2040 ---
okay

--- 帖子 #2041 ---
Genuis Di,

I second that motion

All in favor ??

--- 帖子 #2042 ---
i think and i was going to recommend that, so it will be great if it show the total bands width number at all times.

EURUSD - Sell

(little bit worried that a trend change might be taking place though)

EDIT: Stopped out at BE, price could not hold middle band

--- 帖子 #2044 ---
see my last picture, there is an example of my first attempt at implementation

(bottom righthand of screen)

--- 帖子 #2045 ---
It is Goldenspring's Moving Average and it does provide support and resistant.

--- 帖子 #2046 ---
it's perfect John.. can we have the new version??

--- 帖子 #2047 ---
These were two wonderful trades that I missed.Sell below beneath and buy above the yellow line.

--- 帖子 #2048 ---
As requested

this is the TMA True indicator, with distances between bid/band (as before) and now with the total distance between the bands

As both TMA True and TMA normal give the same current and previous bar values I am only modifying the true version (this version also uses less CPU processing and is faster on initial load)

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #2049 ---
You missed out on  a lot of pips with that trade.

--- 帖子 #2050 ---
This could be a nice one but it is too close to the middle of the TMA Band.

--- 帖子 #2051 ---
1 lot size :-)

edit closed: +57 pips

--- 帖子 #2052 ---
Hey guys, just took an easy 30 pips on the eur/usd. what i have found is if you use heiken ashi instead of candles and wait until price goes over sold or over bought on the tma lines. buy or sell when the heiken ashi changes colour and candle closes as long as it still below or above tma lines. i set my target to the opposit far tma line. the heiken ashi seems to change colour either at the same time as the retracement finder or 1 bar before which gives you that slightly better entry. will keep testing and if anyone interested will let you know how it going.

Morning everyone..

first trade of the week..

short on a/u live..  let's see what happens

--- 帖子 #2075 ---
as you all see in the chart things are not going in my favor at the moment..

but i will keep the trade for two reason..

1) the small trend is with me (blue line).. so I risk the sl to be hit..

2) the total risk is within my comfort zone for a loss..

but as for every trader which has some sort of a expectations out of his trade..  I for now expect this to show a bounce off on the upper bracket and resume for possible test of lower bracket..

its necessary to let the price to show his true intentions.. this will avoid too many quick ins and outs.. but you will have your hard sl to be hit here and there..

let's see what happens..

--- 帖子 #2076 ---
perfect G/U trade was missed..

this is a perfect setup unless you got lost in your indies too much..

nice swing.. good enough PB.. both stoch inline.. more than enough distance between entry and HH.. RF gave signal with perfect timing... all you got to do is to ignore the band when all other criteria is meet..

trade was good for easy +20..

I missed it bcz i don not have the alert on such setup and lost track of the manual scanning on my own..

John.. plz help... lol.. can we add this?

--- 帖子 #2077 ---
back to a/u live play..

as you see I got the bounce... now I look for it to see if it holds it, and resume strong for the possible lower band push....

edit.. sl hit..

--- 帖子 #2078 ---
Hi All

for me today I am avoiding currency pairs that don't have at least a european currency in it

this is due to the fact that today is a big american holiday

so at the moment I am concentrating on EU, EJ

just my 2c

Regards, John

--- 帖子 #2079 ---
My EU sell is struggling but still in profit (though i was a bit late entering)

My EJ sell got me a nice easy 24 pips

--- 帖子 #2080 ---
nice trades john..

i missed both of these bcz of late start.

--- 帖子 #2081 ---
ok, so i lied

as I was looking at AU to further study P.Dean's trade a sell signal came up

as it was offering a risk reward of 1:2.7 I thought what the hell, and took it - nothing ventured, nothing gained

--- 帖子 #2082 ---
EU - 32.6 pips - it took a while but my eu trade finally hit tp

--- 帖子 #2083 ---
Hi mate

what is that indicator with blue and red dots called, do u mind sharing it?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #2084 ---
Hi,

Hope got the right entry this time, please comment.

--- 帖子 #2085 ---
Hi,

Out at -7, both stoch showed "up" after I enter short on RFI

--- 帖子 #2086 ---
Hi,

Is this call MOM trade?

--- 帖子 #2087 ---
NO

--- 帖子 #2088 ---
no,

you have entered a buy when the 4hr stoch is clearly down

a mom trade is inline with the 4hr stoch from the opposite band

ie. 4hr stoch down, sell trade from upper band

4hr stoch up, buy trade from lower band

I would suggest you read the rules again.

regards, John

--- 帖子 #2089 ---
Can you explain what is MOM trade? BTW, is my entry correct this time?

--- 帖子 #2090 ---
hi

have been working on an improved entry system, which is based on a number of systems available taking appropriate bits from each

so from this thread, I took the TMA True and parts of the MOM trade concept, other threads i have taken other things from directly or the concepts behind them

when all is done this will be packaged into one indicator

although as this final system will look very different to this one it will probably go into it's own thread.

that said, almost all systems that are based on retracements will give similar signals

regards, john

--- 帖子 #2091 ---
read Johns post...

get the basics down and then it be easier to help you  out..

--- 帖子 #2092 ---
AU - +13.8 pips - got within 5 pips of it's original tp, but just couldn't make it over the line, the pullback was then strong and took me out

but for a supposedly quiet day not bad

3 trades, 3 wins (see earlier posts)

24 + 32.6 + 13.8 = 70.4 Pips

will now carry on to see if I can iron out the bugs in my new indicator

--- 帖子 #2093 ---
John,

any reason for the later exit... the second push of the lower band was good for +30 bank... why did you passed?  are you testing that new indie?

Hey Pete,

I've noticed that you must have a different setting than 'standard' on your RF (I don't mean the colours but the signal's setting: looking at your chart, it seems to give you more up/down signals);

For example on my e/y i only got a down signal 1 bar after yours: by then I would not have taken the trade for 2 reasons:

1) price already too far away from top TMA (in fact it was touching the middle band)

3) risk reward ratio not good with rising lower TMA only 13 pips away;

I'm just wondering if your different RF setting is giving you more entries (good) but also more false ones (bad).

Just asking.... we all trade as we want.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #2112 ---
short on e/u...  let's see howmuch i lose on this one.. lol

edit 1.. risk dropped to half.. now either it runs to lower band or hits the sl.. -10 is right about my avg loss..

edit 2.. out at BE...

--- 帖子 #2113 ---
I take it your talking to me.. but i am not Pete its Dean.. lol

now..

to me, entry is just a excuse to get in... sure some criteria has to meet in order for me to get in..

but... i am more focus on Trade Management that comes after the trigger... the early RF settings is not my signal for entry.. its more for early alert on a possible setup, so I can buy some extra time for scanning and better decision making.

i rather take a shot and not miss out.. but I hardly let the hard sl to be hit.. I look for a strong break if its not there and my risk on the trade is high.. i cut it and move on to the next setup.

--- 帖子 #2114 ---
for example.. i just got three bearish signals on  gu, ej, au.. if i had to take action which one do you think would be more logical??

--- 帖子 #2115 ---
Sorry Dean, dunno where I got the 'Pete' from lol

I'd favour the cable setup out of the 3 as it has the best r/r ratio in my book but no signal to short it yet, at least on my settings

edit: obviously i didn't edit fast enough lol ----> "but no signal to short it yet, at least on my settings"

+ at those levels (61xx) 4H Stoch is now up (as well as 1H) so no short here

--- 帖子 #2116 ---
wow.. cable was rejected by me on the first look.. I can not go short on that.. simply too far from the band its passed the OB and its into new zone of making bullish strides..

my answer was No to all three.. and i make those decisions within a minute or two max..

the point is that i get a lot of signals but not all survive through my scanning tube.. its just early alert to not miss out on a possible valid trade.

I can give you all one other tip about how to deal best for the entry not late and not premature.. if i hear interests i make a post about it..

--- 帖子 #2117 ---
AUDUSD Sell

EDIT: Not the best start to the day (-15.2 Pips)

though I think I know what I did wrong, and not take notice of what the bands were telling me, plus the fact that the thick white line is the last lower high.

--- 帖子 #2118 ---
i got a short pending order on this right below the big bearish candle..

my reasoning..

PA is just awfully indecisive to take shot before the close of the bar..

and other major pairs kind of dollar unhappy.. lol

so i decided to go conservative on this one with the pending..

--- 帖子 #2119 ---
yeah, thinking about it, I might have been better to see if it broke the low of the previous attempt down

there is only one thing you can guarantee, which ever option you choose invariably it's the wrong one!!!

--- 帖子 #2120 ---
now in short with au..

--- 帖子 #2121 ---
yep... and that's why they:   that's why we play the game..

a Trader is made.. off his decisions in real time.. rest is just stories.

today i might have to go out and buy myself a winner.. lol

--- 帖子 #2122 ---
ok Dean, I'd be interested to hear your views "about how to deal best for the entry not late and not premature"

Thanks

Di

--- 帖子 #2123 ---
you all saw how i screwed up this one.. lol

but, it was a live decision making.. its easy to criticize or praise now about an hour later..

--- 帖子 #2124 ---
you've got us all salivating on how you reject certain signals quickly

sometimes for me i get an itchy finger and just go when the signal comes, then think about it afterwards (not a good strategy)

though I am thinking now that for me at least a filter should be the TMA band, it should either be neutral (ie. flat) or going in my direction

looking back at the trades I have made, the trades that took the least heat (drawdown) were ones where the bands were either sloping in direction or flat (of course some of these closed at b/e or less profit than it should have been - but that's just bad trade management on my behalf)

every trade I have taken that is hit full sl (ie no chance to reduce the risk in trade) has been when i have tried to get in at the beginning of the move back to the trend direction early, while it is still on it's correction)

last au trade was case in point

--- 帖子 #2125 ---

yeah the markets appear to be in a consolidation mode

eu looks though it might set up for scalp short

have you looked at the staircase breakouts thread?  I created the longer consolidation zone on my 15m and extended it, then switched to 5m

the market went back into consolidation at the last level of consolidation set the other week on 1st july

--- 帖子 #2131 ---
i don't get your post John.. i may well be missunderstood as i think you upset with me..  if that's the case.. first of all i am sorry, and secondly I solely was talking about myself and how real time is so much different than hindsight.. bcz of what i could see or not see then when I made my exit.

--- 帖子 #2132 ---
no, not upset with anyone

maybe I explained it wrong (english is not my first language)

in an earlier post (post 2122) you mentioned that if you get enough replies you will explain how could give us one other tip on how to avoid bad entries

thats what I am waiting on.. the other tip

regards, john

--- 帖子 #2133 ---
We got about the same entry, I think we will be happy with this one

:nerd:

--- 帖子 #2134 ---
well it went down 20 pips so at least i have managed to set sl to break even

because it seems to be having problems (as so many of my trades do) holding the break of the mid-line

whatever happens now it is a "free" trade

--- 帖子 #2135 ---
oh my mistake then.. my apology..

sure i give it out..

but I also said if i see enough interest as i don't want people to think I am forcing anything or show boating etc.. you know how one can get attacked for no reasons in forums in general.. you come with the best intention and get slammed all of sudden.. lol

but i must warn its nothing super technical.. it's just something simple i use.

ok to everyone..

its called the 4th minute of the 5 minute candle..

for example..

when the RF signal goes off or you get a candle that is breaking back inside the band that your looking to get in the action off the OB or OS or mom.. instead of getting in right away on the first 3minutes of the candle or the beginning stage of it.. or waiting for the full candle to close and getting in on the next candle..

instead of both those scenarios... wait up to the arrival of the 4th minute of the candle... IF it has shaped into solid candle in your direction than you can enter within that 4th minute... whatever the candle shape is up to the 4th minute it will most times stay the same or better and not change most times to completely a different look on the last minute of it..

so if i choose to make a early entry it will be in this fashion.

I hope it's find useful.. it's just a tip from a brother..

--- 帖子 #2136 ---
yeah same here , I set stop at be+10,

went for breakfast, didnt have the MOmentum so stopped out at +10

thats the way ...I like it

--- 帖子 #2137 ---
will have to pay closer attention to the charts and check this out

cheers

--- 帖子 #2138 ---
EU, stopped out at BE, spiked up, took me out, then continued back down

maybe the us traders celebrated a bit too much yesterday and can't decide what they want to do today.

I am beginning to think, that maybe i should never move my initial sl as this has happened a few times

if at trade entry I am willing to lose x pips, maybe i should just accept that and always leave my stop as is

--- 帖子 #2139 ---
I also find it best to not touch the initial stop if its within the comfort zone appitite for a loss.. my e/u trade was the same.. i decided to go for a no risk trade and i end up losing on a +20 profit..

it allows the PA to develop and show its true intention and it also saves us from extra trades as to less in's and out's..

maybe its better to lose one big one instead of two or three little one and miss possible profit potential on top of all..

your thought and comment folks??

--- 帖子 #2140 ---
i know what you mean

i got in again on the EU but at a price 15 pips lower than my earlier entry, so first I lost on spread / slippage on the first trade (3.2pips), and my second trade started out at effectively -15

come on people - this is a forum - share your thoughts/opinion on this subject

otherwise it's gonna get very lonely in here

--- 帖子 #2141 ---
well John my friend.. what i have found is that people are full of comments, excitement and etc, when market is alive and kicking and other times not so much so.. when market is ranging and not alive most people lose money or not make as much so it's natural to either quit for the day or stay quiet, or worse go on tilt and not to come to talk about it.. lol

but on the same token, the fact of the matter is that a Trader becomes "A Trader" when he can bear with these days the same as the good days... if you all ask me for example, I have learned and find tuned things awful a lot more on bad range/chop days verses the good alive trending days.. one's true skill would get build stronger from handling the range and choppy days no matter what system you use at some point you will have to face it.. sometimes its easy to avoid the range days in total, but chop days are impossible bcz it keeps you on your toes and it makes you think that this is the one that can run or make profit on..

anyways, that's why i choose to stay more active even more on such days in forum bcz that's the time to help and get help and not to get bored mean time.. so its a win win situation.. and if everyone could do the same, i think only good could come out of it if trading is your goal and passion.

for example the first two weeks of this thread.. market was really hot.. there was runs and runners left and right overall it was alive market..  the last two weeks, not so glamorous..  but the questions is in which period we learned more and made the necessary adjustments up to now so we can successed on both period and more importantly to avoid vanishing our accounts..  i think everyone should know the answer..

i think John has been perfect example as to keep monitoring and coming up with different tools and etc, for better results.. but i don't think he would be as more active if he was making 50 100+ like the first week..

so John my hats off to you bud.

just some words from the guy next door everyone, don't take anything i say too serious.. lol

--- 帖子 #2142 ---
My morning ...all euro/dollar

Now breaktime

See you fellas later

--- 帖子 #2143 ---
sorry for not showing this from the beginning got busy with making the last post..

this pair has been super ranging all day.. but once it broke the lower band and quickly bouncing back inside the canal and the band.. i took it on the RF 4th mintue and will be exiting soon if it don't break the upper band.. my expactation out of this trade is to reach the upper canal daily range (blue line).. but i will not hesitate to settle for any less than 15 20+.. right now its flirting with the upper band..

i just wanted to show the 4th minute entry example on this one..

edit 1 :  puts to rest for +16.. i was hoping to get more so i can finish the day with break even.. but now i might have to swallow some loss for the day.

--- 帖子 #2144 ---

good going,

today i kept on hoping for breakout's that just never materialised

and from your trade statement it seems that scalp, scalp and scalp some more was definitely more profitable

i normally position trade, looks like there is whole lot of other nuances to short-term trading..

the good thing is, I've narrowed it down to my 2 biggest weaknesses and both are to do with exits (which is funny as most systems on threads deal with entries)

1) stop losses (not used to them as they really aren't applicable in position trading)

2) when to scalp and when to run profits (again not used in position trading)

regards, John

--- 帖子 #2146 ---
following up on john's post.. about one knowing his weakness/strength and exit..

my weakness is to take action on every valid opportunities.. not being present all the time..

but about exit... i just go with amusing the worse at first always.. IMHO its impossible to know , feel, assume or predict what kind of a market is in store for us starting our days out or even mid day or end of the day,, this damn thing can run or make sideways PA on a blink.. as soon as one decides to scalp for the day.. market will take one direction on one signal and runs to the moon and when decides go for runners, market will go sideways till you get sick to your stomach.. both can result in damages once market fuck with the mental..

so, when I enter a trade on top of the key (bands ob/os) my first intention/expectations out that trade is to exit at the other side of the band if its not presented with a clear strong break of the band.. so on other word i start as a scalp mentality and what i get beyond it would be a bonus .. even though i really gun for longer profit, a runner like.. it's only kept in back of my mind but with hawks eye on the band price action.. so I  would not hesitate to take the profit on wishy-washy action at the band.. I actually grade myself on such exits.. other day i made terrible decision on banking with G/U while it was a clear strong break of the band.. i got +17 PA ran for 120.. me as a trader that little part is a make or break for me.. and it's superbly vital in this system to not exit prematurely on clean strong break when its visible easily..

now, this works with this system.. for two reasons.. 1) bcz we get plenty of opportunities even on rangy sluggish days, so a +5 +10 here and there will sum up to a good amount at end of the day like docrock results..2) this system skins the cat in two ways... ranging market and trending market.. so could be always in the action to get your chunk.

with these two luxury at hand.. it's ok to bank less than your risk.. our true risk in most setups is 20 25pips.. but with high hit ratio when banking +10's.. you can make pretty good bottom line at the end of the week or month even on most days..

that's my take on the exit issue.

again this is just me.. do what makes sense to you.. what fits your plan and goals and simply what seems right for you overall.

Hi fellow traders,

I have been using this system for some time now and it works pretty well for retracement entries for a continuing trend. However, i am unclear on how to enter or spot trend reversals with this system.

Any thoughts?

Cheers

Vicky

--- 帖子 #2154 ---
good morning everyone,

I don't like to show later live charts.. but i got busy with a few trades..

for learning purposes if it worth's any i decided to post it..

want to show the power of trading the OB/OS style.. bcz if it's in the mood of running than you will have the best entry point in world and the luxury to hold the trade comfortably for mass of profit once it breaks the band strongly and heads further down and as you see it even broke the daily LL range and that's always is a good sign for even more profit or at least alive market at hand to play MOM later..

today could be fun..

i am also live on e/j..

If too much hesitation in the current area i will bank at daily LL..

--- 帖子 #2155 ---
Hi Vicky,

welcome to the thread..

you wait for one of the stoch's to turn in the reversal direction normally the 1hr (30m) first.. and then more importantly you'll wait for the band to lose its form of striking in one direction and turns into a more of a settle or flat or semi flat at least before you take your first shot at it.. this only if you got a trend in your hand meaning 80-100 plus move in one direction..

but also remember when your on a trend your mostly looking firstly for MOM trade.. meaning the first retrace at some point to reach the opposite band.. so this helps you to sit on your hands patiently to not get involve in the middle of the NO MAN's LAND.. you should know what that is: yes you guessed it.. the correction.

I hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #2156 ---
Hi Aida,

thanks for the kind words and welcome to the thread.

here is the indi..

--- 帖子 #2157 ---
Been with this system from day 1, and have enjoyed your posts ,

on returning here after being away for last 2 weeks i notice your stoch indicator is set to 30min & 4hr is this your own method and if so is it more successful than the 1hr/4hr

--- 帖子 #2158 ---
update..

chart explains it all why I have hold so far down still..

simply it has been a straight shoot down with clear strong break at each hurdle.. first was the lower band.. than, daily LL and later yesterdays LL..

--- 帖子 #2159 ---
thanks for noticing..

this is something my friend John who does all the tech work for us here tried and tested.. and it just made sense to me more to go with the 30m vs 1hr.. there is not much difference.. my indicators don't tell me what to do really.. i just use them to be alerted a bit early on a possible setup so i can scan faster and not miss opportunities.

not a sexy answer but I put it as honestly as i could.

--- 帖子 #2160 ---
closed right after the snap shot for +79...

it must be due now for a some kind of retrace and its better to not be greedy and bank 6 times more than what we usually bank for..

ej closed for +52 as well..

--- 帖子 #2161 ---
as you all see market is moving along a cross the board $$ happy.. so we so far we got a daily direction but not a trend yet.. so this is where it can get tricky when we look for MOM trade in two ways..

1) you can sit all day and not get the prefect MOM setup..

2) you can get the MOM setup to only get faked out..

lol..

so what do we do???

folks if you want me to continue you must get engaged.. otherwise there is no point in going further..  bcz i know all this shit, i am just doing this to help you out.. but its safe to say it also helps me to not be bored while i wait for setups and one can learn new thing any day.. who knows.

anyways, the ball is in your court nowww..

long on cad live.. sweet MOM setup

looking to exit soon for +10... unless tears the top..

edit..

out for +9.5

--- 帖子 #2166 ---
Hello, i was wondering if it is wise to take a trade (if all the signs and setup is correct) lets say five minutes before a new market opens, for example 5 minutes before NY opens.

With the news i usually let go the setups that happens just between five and ten minutes before.

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #2167 ---
I think if your going to pay toomuch attention this sort of stuff than you got to filter most of the trading day.. there is always some news or some clown speech or session opening and closing..

so with all that said... I only let go of a setup on major news.. such as NFP.. rate announcements.. and major major speeches (like Bernanke or Trichet).. rest, i ignore..

--- 帖子 #2168 ---
Hello Guys,

I have been following this thread from the beginning. It looks very promising and you did a great job testing and improving it so far. I try to find the best SL and TP levels. I noticed that every time the trade went very well >30 pips, there was never a drawdown bigger than 15 pips. So I have a SL of 15 on every trade. I'm also experimenting with a trailing stop, but I haven't found a good universal trailing stop size.

For TP I exit a trade when either stochastics move and close (the bar closes that made the stoch turn) the other way.

I would love to hear your opinions and SL/TP strategies.

--- 帖子 #2169 ---
Hi,

keep it simple..

SL.. above/below last HH/LL.. it could be sometimes at 10pips or 25pips.. PA needs breathing room..

TP.. keep a eye on +10 on every trade.. than the reach of the band.. than the break or stall at the band.. than break of each level such as daily ranges..

I highly recommend to not let yourself in control of any indicator to tell you what to do.. especially on exit.

--- 帖子 #2170 ---
alright folks.. I am done and out for some tennis action today..

I made +180 today which about 100 of it was live played here.

i could have done even better if i had got both signals on a/u and e/j instead of just the first ones.. I also did not give whole a lot of respect or time for the MOM setups of g/u and cad that i took and bailed for +10's.

I hope i was any help to you as well.. that's the only reason i post my charts and live play.

Cheers,

Dean

--- 帖子 #2171 ---
The time you and John give to this thread is greatly appreciated.

Today has been a good game of tennis for you, You came prepared to play, tossed the ball and played for the points. You won some, you lost others, but the end result is you came out ahead of all the others who turned up to play today and didn't toss a ball in the air to serve.

Great piece of psychological study.

Looking forward to the game tomorrow.

Di

--- 帖子 #2172 ---
Good for you my man. Wish I had the time to trade today. Market had been cruel to us this few days.

Thank's again.

--- 帖子 #2181 ---
good morning...

long on a/u live..

edit... out at BE...

it did not burst to upper band and now looks sluggish.. better to get out and even and look for the next opportunty..

i sort of screwed this one up firstly with my later entry (about 3pips late).. so that lead to not being able to bank +10 minimum..

next baby.. i got my game face on.... what about you all?

--- 帖子 #2182 ---
Long on e/j live...

the band is not exactly flat.. but this is where i bend the rule a bit and not let the indicator to dictate me..

the PA is in a 60 pips range for the day so once PA creeps back inside the band it's good sign it might reach the other side.. so its ok to take shot for scalp..

edit...

out for +11

--- 帖子 #2183 ---
first. Kevin left..

now, John has left..

guess who is next!!!..

awfully lonely in here..  get the hint..

--- 帖子 #2184 ---
its a MOM trade.. i did not hesitate on this and got in right away.. RR is superb..  so lets get it.. short on e/u Live..

--- 帖子 #2185 ---
I tell you guys what my plan is on this one before anything happening yet.. gotta have a plan before the battle begins..

first of all I be patience with this to show his true hand..

now.. if it goes in my direction.. i will really try to see if it breaks the lower band.. bcz if it does it strongly it be headed down for the days LL..

if it stalls big time at the lower band than i take the +10to 15..

so lets see what happens..

--- 帖子 #2186 ---
late...........but here to watch this fine tennis player.

Where's John gone?

Di

--- 帖子 #2187 ---
thanks for kind words as always bud..

during my college days of playing.. our coach was all about energy and enthusiasm..

so he would come in on the middle of practice from his office and if he would felt the slightest laziness or dis-activity out of the group.. he would say this in loud:

come on fellas.. we ain't playing wheelchair tennis here.. lol

well that's how it feels out here at the moment.

just some fun words from old memories.

--- 帖子 #2188 ---
still holding.. lowed the risk to around 10..

my feel is that pa will touch and perhaps smash the lower band..  lets see though.. i always keep my expectation in check.. i dump it in a heartbeat as well...

but just telling you guys on my though process if it worth's any for you

edit.. my next move on the risk is to drop it to BE if i see a strong lower band close as it is happening at the moment..

--- 帖子 #2189 ---
out for +13 right after the snap shot...  it's not the pan out to the strong break I was looking for, so taking the money and going to the next setup..

.. you see how fast i dumped my feel and expectations.. no attachments what so ever..

this is a key point in trading..

it's irrelevant what PA will do from here on... i assessed the situation live.. made decision, executed.. and that's that.

--- 帖子 #2190 ---
Hi P Dean

I like your contribution in this forum. Thanks for sharing ur setups and educating us.

Also a million Thanks to Kevinator for helpings us Junior members.

Thanks alot

Hi All

sorry been unable to post for a few days

my internet connection decided to up & die on me - and for some reason swiss efficiency didn't work that well in getting it back going

with tomorrow being nfp, not sure there will be much opportunity to trade - but if not there's always next week

Reading back through the posts since i was offline though, it seems P.Dean has been blazing the way in showing you how to trade this system profitably - which makes me really sad I was unable to trade with.

Regards

John

--- 帖子 #2192 ---
Your welcome..

the rf indie is the same one in the 1st post.. you can go under color and change it to whatever you want.

--- 帖子 #2193 ---
good to have you back John.. and thanks for the kind words.

agree on the NFP days.. notoriously its a slow rangish day prior to the announcement.. so for me its always a off day.. and i use this day for withdrawal once a month.. (that's another good tip for everyone).. it keeps me away from trouble before the announcement and the temptation after to do stupid things.. lol.. and instead i collect what and if i have made any profit during the prior month of trading.

so tennis all day tomorrow.

have a good weekend everyone.. may all your trading come with green Benjamins (that's how we say it in the west-coast anyways )

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #2194 ---
Heres 2 trades I took this morning sorry couldn't post had to get to work. I took EU short for +25 and a swissy long for +100 both trades had been outside TMA bands and got in on RF signal little late on EU. The swiss trade I had a 20 pip trail that never got hit before tp was reached.

--- 帖子 #2195 ---
good going, now i am really upset that my internet was down, everyone was making money but me

ah well, next week beckons..

turbo,

I been trying to hold back and not say anything..but its the end of it now.. listen.. hindsight charts don't mean a damn thing nor help anyone anywhere or in this thread in particular.. showing what your keep showing its nothing but to tell everyone that you made such and such amount, which none of us give a heck about.... this is a damn live trading thread.. it's important to know HOW you held for +25 or +100 in real time as PA passed through the hurdles.. this thread is not like every other bullshit thread that they only preach the goddamn past with bs charts and garbage analysis in the dark or after the fact..

I made over 160 pips today.. so what, who gives a fuck.. George Soros made 25mil on one trade with citi bank, I can care or less unless he comes and show it to me while he did it.. otherwise he can shove it bcz it don't help me a thing regardless of he actually did it or not, its irrelevant.. but people give a hell and find it useful when I (or John ,Kevin and a few others) live played two of those trades with full commentary at each step.. that helps people.. its the closest thing to real as far as the forums communication goes.. its called useful contribution to the community at hand.

that's what this thread is all about and the lack of that is the sole reason why you all ain't got your founder of the thread here anymore.. point blank now you know why.

now this message goes to you in particular and everyone else..
If you can not post live trade charts, DO NOT POST AT ALL.. or I will have you banned if constantly the issue is ignored.. be practical folks.

with utmost respect

Dean

ps) if you or anyone find this post offending i simply do not care.. i am being logical within the rules and meaning of this thread.. i will not respond or reply back to any useless post.. i got better things to do and would not have any problem to terminate my activity in this thread if you wish.. just take it as it is and follow within the range of this thread and everything should be fine.. thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #2198 ---
Hi, P.Dean!

What are your channel indi?? I think it differs from what is in first page posted.

Thanks in advance.

K.

--- 帖子 #2199 ---
Well personally I don't care what you think some people do work and can't post untill they get back to the computer. I do show charts that are live during asia trading if I take a trade. If you read my post I said I had a 20 pip trailer that never got hit before tp to get that 100 pips. The important thing is the charts show entry which is by the system. Now learn how to be a little more respectable to people that are trying to keep this thread going or you will be talking to yourself like you have been the last couple of days.

Kevin ran a few people off being so defensive thinking everyone was trying to doubt the system when they simply was asking questions and your beginning to do the same thing. Lets not get in a pissing match and show what we can to help everyone.

Edit: Also post 2161 you posted a so called after the fact chart and Kevin never posted a live trade just after the fact charts.

--- 帖子 #2200 ---
Its the TMA True not the regular TMA

Hello everybody!

First I want to thank the threadstarter to share his great system and to P.Dean and jmw1970 for their education and to keep this thread alive.

It´s my first post here at FF and I still need some time to practice with MT4 and the system.

I hope that I can engage briefly in this thread.

P.Dean: Could you tell me the name of your indicator, where you can see the ranges of the pair and the timezones? I´ve tried several daily range indicators, but they don´t look like yours.

--- 帖子 #2211 ---
got all of that one I think

I have the one that JMW1970 posted (post 1706) !Retrace finder. Probably I will have to use the same you use WoMaie.

BTW very nice trades guys, keep it up!

--- 帖子 #2222 ---
did you read ALL of the post that the indicator was attached too?

the indicator you downloaded requires you to have the indicator "TMA Called" in your indicator list (does not need to be on the screen)

without this it the alerts are not correct

--- 帖子 #2223 ---
After using the RF for awhile Ive turned off alerts.  For one thing it will drive you crazy and also seems I was leaving pips on the table,

So when I see PA moving toward the midline I pull the trigger on Momentum trades,,, can give quite a few more pips

later

Rock...out

Nice trade! Do you ignore the TMA? I only take trades that are on the other side of the TMA or on the middle line. I seem to miss a lot of trades that way.

--- 帖子 #2228 ---
I ignore the TMA when the retracement has been at least 38.2

in strong trending markets waiting for a retrace back to the mid/or opposite line might never happen

--- 帖子 #2229 ---
X

--- 帖子 #2230 ---
in a long trend

put a fibonnacci from the low to the high (so the zero line is at the high), then look for a retrace at least to the 38.2 line

in a short trend the reverse

if you look at the audusd open picture i uploaded you can see my fib.

fibs are used quite a lot in various retracement methods, i just also use it in this one

--- 帖子 #2231 ---
Thanks! Its clear now.

AUDUSD - long

--- 帖子 #2233 ---
AUDUSD +6.6 pips

closed out as the PA wasn't smooth (possibly because ny open soon)

--- 帖子 #2234 ---
I am in that AU long too, still holding, see how NY starts.

--- 帖子 #2235 ---
Why do you trade on the middle line?

--- 帖子 #2236 ---
I take a long trade when stoch 4H up RF alerts and the price is between the middle and the lower band. I will figure out something to catch those big trends when PA never goes below middle band. Perhaps I will try with Fibo as jmw1970 suggested.

--- 帖子 #2237 ---
What do you guys do whem the market rises/ drops huge in just one bar? It seems you can make some pips jumping in. Do you have any experience with this?

http://kepfeltoltes.hu/110713/_j_k_p...toltes.hu_.jpg

--- 帖子 #2238 ---
if you look carefully during these times this is normally due to news etc

(your example was bernanke testifying)

during this time most retail brokers increase their spread massively and also you get lots of requotes

placing a profitable trade once the spike has started in candle is usually very hard

Ok. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #2241 ---
if you were using the TMA True (with distances), you would have seen that this was a risky trade to take

that is the problem with the originally recomended TMA indicator, hence most people use the true version now.

the difference between true and the repaint, is that you would have see that the TMA bands were definitely bearish, for a bullish trade they should be either bullish or neutral (flat or almost)

the picture below shows how it looked on mine - the bands were bearish, even the previous bullish move didn't manage to flatten them out

--- 帖子 #2242 ---
Thank You very much!!!

The diffrence is totally ridiculous. I drop this shxx out.

I tested this system and it is promising but you can only cactch about 3 out of 10 long trends, if you add fib than you are much better off. Should I know something about the fib. you use or its regular stuff?

--- 帖子 #2243 ---
i just use a regular fib, although I remove the 23.6 level

basically for me, it either has to retrace at least to 38.2, or if the retrace doesn't reach 38.2 then I am looking for a breakout entry around the zero line

the original system was already profitable, I personally trade it though slightly different (with fibs, no stochastics, etc) to make it more profitable and allow me to catch more of the trends (especially important if you missed the first entry)

--- 帖子 #2244 ---
Thank You for helping me so much!

I know its profitable. I am a beginner and i made nice profits with it, but if I am doing something I want to get the most out of it. Since forex is all about the $ thats what I am aiming for.

--- 帖子 #2245 ---
Hello, I need a suggestion from you guys for a tool, where I can move the stop/takeprofit per chart/mouse and set a stop or limit order per mouse/chart.

Now I use a tool called autograf 4 from my demo-broker, which is quite good. The disadvantage is , that the tool is not free and only licensed for a few broker. And I am not sure, if I want to go live with these few broker.

I tried a EA from FF, where I can move the stop/tp per chart, but the movement was quite slowly. I could imagine, that here are few people, who use such a tool and could give a recommendation.

--- 帖子 #2246 ---
Iam not trading this strat so maybe it doesnt fit the needs for this strategy but i use an Charttrader/Trademangement EA like you described it, it works good

Here is also a link where the inputs are  described briefly

Hi

couple of points on your last trades:-

EURGBP - why would you place a buy? the tma bands were clearly against you

USDCHF - your trailing stop was too close, the entry was fine, the stop loss should have been about 0.81595, this has not been touched, by my rough calculations the price hasn't even gone up by more than 15 pips yet

AUDJPY - couple of points, your fib placement, for me the fib should go on the whole of the wave, the first retracement that occurred was not nearly big enough to consider the second move down as a new wave

However that said, with the price already well below the TMA bands, your first target should have been the zero line which it hit

there are 2 main price areas you need to concentrate on in this method when in a trade, how the price reacts at the various band levels, and if using the fib, how the price reacts at the zero line

unless it breaks through these areas with no problem you should be looking to exit

All this has been explained numerous times in the forum, I suggest you go back and read again, particularly helpful are the posts from P.Dean.

In regards to waves and fibs there are various resources and information available on this forum and the web

I  saw P.Dean taking those trades. I also took some of those in the past  with some success. Because the lack of history i can't decide if they  have positive returns. Maybe not.

USDCHF - your trailing stop was too close, the entry was fine, the stop  loss should have been about 0.81595, this has not been touched, by my  rough calculations the price hasn't even gone up by more than 15 pips  yet

Thanks for your insight. I am tring different stops.

It was a long time ago that I studied fib., but I was egar to try them with this method, maybe I was too eager this time.

I  read through the whole thread, but there are some controversal info,  and different apporoaches. I try out every apporoach and also mix them  for best results.

Thank You for your answer!

Hi Balasz227

regarding the first point that I made regarding the TMA bands being against you, this is my personal take

i will occasionally take these, if the price action gives me a reason, the fact that the CCI indicates short/long is not enough reason for me

one method that serves me well, is to look for a 123 pattern to return me to the trend direction after a long retrace (and generally this also "flattens" out the TMA bands a bit)

unfortunately the thread owner no longer participates in the thread, though I am sure that he has lots of filters he uses that he just didn't mention.

P.Dean and others have tried to fill in these "missing" gaps with their own insights, likewise myself.

In the end, what occurs is you take the basic methodology and apply your own style, in the end creating a system that YOU can work with (if you look at some of my later screenshots you will notice my screens do not have stochastics or cci)

What works for others may not work for you.

In the end 90% of the systems in this forum are basically the same, trend following - they may use different indicators but a lot of the entry signals are roughly the same, the reason being almost all indicators are based off candle prices (with the exception of volume indicators) therefore if one signals a buy/sell another one is likely to do so as well.

Regards, John

I am finding that the best SL and TP are +/- 15 Pips.  Having good success with this.

Yeah, aggree,  Still lurking here but like you have tweaked method a bit. Up and down, still getting better. I have a great day, get a swelled head then, get slapped back.

Good thing I dont make a living this way

--- 帖子 #2259 ---
I have been reading this thread with great interest and like to fully understand what each indicator is and how it's created.  I have looked at the code for TMA but what is the background/code as I don't fully understand it?

Is it a triple moving average smoothed?  In straight forward trading talk - what is it?

Any help would be great.

--- 帖子 #2260 ---
hi

mid-line is a linear weighted moving avg of x periods (default 56)

upper and lower lines are an average true range multiplier (default 2) of x periods (default 100)

--- 帖子 #2261 ---
Thanks jmw1970.  I'll have a think about that.  But repainting - can't be good for backtesting I guess?

--- 帖子 #2262 ---
I (and i think most people) use the TMA True, no repainting

--- 帖子 #2263 ---
Thanks jmw1970.  I'll try using the True TMA.  It definitely gives a much different picture than the repainting/hindsight TMA.

--- 帖子 #2264 ---
@jmw1970

Thanks for all your work.

May i ask you, which indicator draws the arrows of your trades in the chart?

this is a standard feature of MT4

to show a historical trade on the chart, go into the terminal section and "drag & drop" the order onto the price chart

Just woke up and took a quick scan thru the five pairs that i trade and entered just 2, im no master at this, just learning like any other person.

--- 帖子 #2274 ---
kola,

your entry is a bit late on G/U. try to depend less on the indicators and pay more attention to the PA reaction to the band.. if you got a neutral or favorable band, you don't wanna get in late..

obviously it worked out this time but its markets evil way of and giving you a sweet taste only to burn you many other times.

I took this trade on the close of the 1st red candle slightly below the tma band.

just trying to help.. you may disregard everything above.

Dean

--- 帖子 #2275 ---
I'll look into that, i need all the help i can get.

btw i took 25 on gu and im setting my stop to -5pips on usdchf since im leaving the house, will try come back for NY session.

--- 帖子 #2276 ---
nice job on banking and lowering the risk.

the only reason i allowed myself to make comments it's bcz i see in your trades you disregard one of the most important things.. and that is.. ignoring the band.. OB/OS issue which is the cornerstone of this method and in trading in general..

your goal is to get on sell when is most over bought on a neutral or favorable band and vise verse and set you eyes and heart firstly on banking at opposite band PA reaction.. if it don't break it strong.. bank the +10/+15.. but if you get in late or on the bottom of the band than the risk too high for a possible reward.

I hope it make sense.

--- 帖子 #2277 ---
Nice of you to share this chart. Sweet trade! May i ask what trading  room you got this trade from or where I can learn about this method?  Me?  Im just an old stock trader who is hoping to make a transition to  the slower longer time frames of Forex so I dont get high blood  pressure.  -)  I could use a good trading room that lets the attendees  actually talk to each other as well. Know of a good room with real pro's  behind it. You seem like a pro yourself, that's why I ask.

thanks,

Hi

It's a great looking chart all right.......one that people dream about, but that is what it was...........all a dream The indicators that Android38 was using at the time to backtest, re-paint, so it shows a picture of a chart that wasn't the one seen in real time.................sad, but true.

Now, thanks to  jmw1970, there is a TMA True indicator available, along with others that don't re-paint.

If you are looking for a "transition to  the slower longer time frames of Forex so I dont get high blood  pressure.  -)" you won't find it here in a thread that is discussing a method on 5 minute charts. You will however find lots of helpful info on various FF threads.

Best wishes for your transition to forex.

Sorry to burst the bubble.

Just woke up and scanned through all the pairs that i trade, all the pairs seems to have moved already and i dont seem to see anywhere to jump in for now, but im looking at au, uc, if you notice the au is signaling sell (4hr stoch) but i dont take such set up coz of the tma slightly moving upward showing buy, i would rather wait for it to move sideways first or something, atleast thats how i look at it.

Hi,

I do some live trading today..

short on e/u live... looking for a lower band crush.. if not i bank what i can around +10/+15..

(thanks for the nice words duffy)

edit.. out for +8... damn thing made a quick touch bounce..

--- 帖子 #2283 ---
I hope im not posting too many charts already and not mislead anybody here, contribution is 100% accepted.

I might have entered late though.

ps: just added eu

--- 帖子 #2284 ---
yep kola.. your entry is way too late.. if your gonna get on such trades it's vital to get in much earlier (on the second bear candle)..

for everyone..

I would recommend to avoid entering post mid band unless you got over +10 room possible profit..

nice to be active and involve in most setups though kola.. this is a good quality as trader to not be scared to pull the trigger.

--- 帖子 #2285 ---
I'll put that in mind. thanks.

--- 帖子 #2286 ---
ok as you all see i got cheated out of a extra 20pips profit... but i had a good reason for it..

as you see in the charts... my bet was against the trend (red line) as a  reversal trade... so in such cases if i don't see a immediate strong  band break and instead a quick bounce off the band.. i go for the bank  rather than waiting.. so i take the +8 over a -10 anytime in such  situations.

its all about your plan of your trading and not what market will do or don't, controlling the situation and get controlled.

Hi Dean,

in your trade, AU 4h Stoc is red (pointing down), would you mind to tell me why did you go long?

Thanks,

Kin

--- 帖子 #2291 ---
sure..

I pretty much disregard the stoach when the pair is in a range PA (60pips up to date for the day).. I just basically play the band.. get in with OB/OS of the band..

over 80 pips in one direction or a extreme striking band look alike if under that range.. to me is a trendish 5m chart..

--- 帖子 #2292 ---
you all saw what GU did... sling shot up for mass.. lol

the damn pair is always in it's own world..

np.. get'em the next time..

--- 帖子 #2293 ---
I exited all my trade today for 10pips each since i was leaving the house and i didn't want to just set and forget, all would have gotten to my 25pips target, its okay though.

P Dean, you are trying using less stop, mine is usually 15-20pips for gu,eu,uchf, and 10-16pips for uc,au  but after the market move in my favor, i try to reduce risk as i deem fit.

--- 帖子 #2294 ---

Greetings fellas, I have a question regarding news trading and this system and I hope somebody can shed some light on me.

Today in specific is a very news oriented day due to EU Summit and I was wondering how do you approach days like these or do you perhaps stay away from them.

EDIT :

exit for +5 pips.

I was kind of unsure to go short because we know that eurozone debt issue has found some good hopes after the EU summit, and USD is dumped. It means I think EU should go up insted of down.

--- 帖子 #2298 ---
Hi everyone,

This was a perfect setup off the favorable OB band good for +16..

I would not call this one a MOM setup bcz there is no real direction and the pullback was almost the same as the swing.. so for me just a favorable band play.

My first post here, so why not start with first trade i made with this

system. Nice clean 28 pips on E/U at the start of Frankfurt open.

I didn't read the whole thread (page 37), but I'm trying to implement what has been said till that page.

I have noted that this thread has exhausted itself due to the lack of thread replies. Why has it come to that. Has this system proved to be unsuccessful or is there something else i didn't pick up on, till the last page.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #2302 ---
Htsimic6, I am still using this system and quite successfully, However I added another indicator from "making trading simple" and it sure makes it a little more  "MECHANICAL" which suits my style of trading.

And the other thing which slowed things down somewhat was the owner of the thread....he just did a vanishing act !!!!

--- 帖子 #2303 ---
Can you share the indi to help others still interested with this system

--- 帖子 #2304 ---
Hi All

one of the main contributors (P.Dean) after Kevinator did his vanishing act has started a new thread which is based on some of the same principles but simplified and with less lag.

The thread can be found at

jmw thanks for the link.

I'm posting my second trade for today (I missed one earlier)

on E/U with +10 this time.

I exited earlier because of 1h overbought stoch, and price was coming

from middle TMA (true) and new time was near. Few bars later price reach upper TMA band, (sudden spike -  US news time), so I could bank 20-30 pips on this one too.

I must say that I'm satisfied with my performance today +38 on just one pair, spending only 2 hours of trading.

I throw my eye on a new P.Dean thread that is similar to this one, but much simplified. His thread has only 24 pages so i will read through it all the way, to conclude if it is suitable for me.

Hi all friends,

I happened to come to this thread yesterday and today I installed the indicators and templates on my MT4 Charts.

After installing the Template a window opened with this message

"Retrace Found :GBPUSD @: 5"

What does this mean?

I shorted the GBP/USD pair but the candles started going up instead

of going down.

Does it mean to go Long or to go Short.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Hello, Can anyone tell me if they have forward tested this? I am looking at 1h and 4h charts with appropriate stochs etc and matching them up with my 5 m chart a month back and the results are dismal. Kevin seems to claim when you forward test the repainting of some indicators is offset by filtering with multiple indicators.. but I have found breakeven is a best case scenario..

I find it a bit weird if the strategy i so good, why use the TMA's that repaint to make the strategy look awesome..why not let the tmatrue speak for itself, but I assume if all the ones kev posted were trues, the results would look far less impressive.. also, saying you "know" when the market is overbought or oversold in so far as disregarding the stoch direction..another thing easy to say, but what data are you using to "decide" the market is ready to turn, apparently against the indicators advice, just at the right time every time? seems to me this whole thread is built of repainting and after the fact claims of knowledge without any reasoning... diappointing.

--- 帖子 #2314 ---
Hey everyboy, It's my first post, so, I'd like to clear one doubt.

Is it safe to trade in the middle of TMF?

You guys just buy around 20 stoch and sell around 80?

does anybody tried this system on live account with proven results?

Thanks.

My trade is not a brilliant one plus i only tried it on $80 account, but profit is profit. It is $184 now.
