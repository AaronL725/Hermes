This thread will be an ongoing effort to achieve 100 pips per day (500/week) through the development of an automated EA. Different techniques, indicators and methods will be used from EA to EA. Some indicators may be added, others dropped - all to help us get closer to our goal. Goal: 100 pips per day (500/week) Base Funds: $5000 Restrictions: Not to blow a $5000 for any given month for the past 12 months. $5000 account balance not to go below $4000 in any given testing month. Work on multiple pairs reliably. This first post will be used to give important information such as direct links to the current version of EA and other important "quick reference" information. TRADING STRATEGIES DANGER ZONE: inside the 2 red dotted lines (+20/-20 level of 89SMA) next to the blue line (89SMA) - a lot of whipsaw goes on here as the market consolidates and tries to figure out which direction to go. RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT ENTER a trade from inside the danger zone. MIDDLE OF THE RIVER: In between the red dotted lines (+20/-20 level of 89SMA) and the outer bank of the river (+89/-89 level of 89SMA). RECOMMENDATION: Although anything CAN happen, normally the trend is beginning to establish itself. Once you detect the trend is stable, you could enter the trade and exit near/outside the bank of the river it is headed to wards. OUTSIDE THE RIVER BANKS: Outside the 2 brown lines (+89/-89 level of 89SMA). RECOMMENDATION: I wouldn't trade while outside these levels but wait till the river comes back into the banks and crosses BOTH the +/-89 AND the 13EMA. Once it's on the other side the trend is fairly stable to continue. EXCEPTION: If through other indicators, tools or trading expertise, you have determined that the trend has changed, you may enter a trade outside the banks and gain some additional pips. 13SMA "Aura" Here's how to trade within the 13SMA Aura http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=209 Known INCOMPATIBLE Pair(s) The following pair(s) are not compatible with this strategy or the EA.

Our first version of Quest100_v1.0 will be based on techniques using Fibonacci levels and SMA's. I call it the Winding River method. INDICATOR Setup: 15m chart (start off with USDJPY) NOTE: GBPJPY needs other settings that haven't been tested yet. The 4 majors work fine. SMA 89 - Median Price - (blue) Levels +89 and -89 (heavier line - brown) SMA 89 - Median Price - (color NONE) Levels +34 and -34 (I use dash for levels) SMA 13 - Close (red) Optional: i-session.mq4 (which displays the Asian, London and USA sessions) Template: attached template (will need i-session.mq4) SIGNAL Setup: The SMA89 is our signal line. If the market goes ABOVE we BUY and BELOW we SELL. STOP/TAKE PROFIT Setup: The SMA13 is used as a guide for the StopLoss. Usually when the market is moving the candle does not fall further than 15 from the SMA13. Thus if we are in a BUY it would be the SMA13 plus 15, SELL SMA13 minus 15 (as a rule of thumb). TakeProfit - Overflow of a bank would mean the SMA89 would be our goal. Crossing the SMA89 would mean the +89/-89 (outer banks) would be our goal. Now as common sense would tell us, the SMA's are moving all the time. That's where an EA comes in to monitor them and adjust them till one is penetrated. I've always known the power of Fibs and just out of curiosity I set a few Fib levels on a couple of SMA's and sure enough Fib's RULE! The next few posts will describe in detail the strategies involved and how the market uses the SMA Fibs as support &amp; resistance.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
General Overview: As you can see in this chart, the market moves from side to side. The SMA89 and it's 2 levels (+89 &amp; -89 brown) keep it inside the river banks. Several times a month the banks will overflow and the market gets outside these boundary's. This is a PERFECT time to enter a trade in the REVERSE direction for some low risk pips. The market always gravitates trodes the middle of the river (SMA89). The dashed lines are the +39 and -39 SMA act as support &amp; resistance to a certain extent. Now we know 3 things so far which can help in designing an EA to watch for certain conditions, reverse if necessary. 1) The market rarely goes outside the +89 &amp; -89 boundary's 2) The market will gravitate toward the SMA89 center 3) Often the SMA 39 levels will indicate a consolidation or reversal condition as well as act as soft support &amp; resistance

--- 帖子 #4 ---
CLOSER LOOK: The cart below is a typical example of how the SMA13 is a good guide for support &amp; resistance and ideal for use as a basis for our StopLoss. In this chart as you can see, the candles never touched it. This is quite common when we just a little momentum to help drive the market. (don't forget we need to add a 15 pip padding to the SMA13 - sometimes a candle may penetrate the SMA13, but not close below it). Quest100_v1.0 EA I have already started developing an EA and with some good results just with the basic rules. I'll be adding some more logic which helps capture even more pips via other "get out if this happens" exit strategies. Hopefully it should be ready for release in about 2 more days. Neal ATTACHMENT: This is the optional indicator that displays the Asian, London and USA sessions as background colors. p.s. By the way - this setup of indicators has great value even if you aren't trading the system or using the EA. It may help you determine whether to get in/out of a trade or when is a good time to reverse.

Hi Neal, Your strategy looks promising. Best of luck with the EA. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Okay Neal, I've followed you over to here now. Good luck with the new project!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yep, your loyal subject has followed you over here as well.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This is going to be a must follow topic

--- 帖子 #9 ---
the system looks great! just made 20 pips in my demo account after reading and setting the whole thing! but i just wonder why it works so well with one pair only?? i tried it on several other pairs and although price does seem to respect these SMA's sometimes, it's not as common as in GBP/JPY....maybe it works with only the volatile pairs?? anyways yeah 1000 pips a day could be possible with this but there needs to be an EA which can assist us....i am anxiously waiting for it! regards, Ghous

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Who developed this EA?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
hi well i am not sure if only i am having problem to downloading this template or other all fellows having the same problem? When i try to download this template or Indicator [just in this thread] it opens blank and downloads nothing. regards

--- 帖子 #12 ---
With the template - you would RIGHT CLICK on the link and say SAVE AS. To answer someone else's question - I am working on the EA. And welcome to the other followers that came to join us. Hopefully this will be the last thread since the name is generic and tied to a "goal" rather than an "indicator" - lol. Neal

--- 帖子 #13 ---
hey Neal can you let us know if this stratgey works on other GBP pairs, i tried it on a few like CAD, AUD, but it looks like a little mixed up, do you trade only the GBP/JPY??

--- 帖子 #14 ---
great thread how do you plan to overcome false signals which are big problem with MA in consolidation

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi guys, sorry for my stupidity , but i did what suggested , but i cannot dowload the template

--- 帖子 #16 ---
nither can I, and I guess there were some pictures on first two posts and I dont see them, well there is still descripition of system and I guess I will experiment with that

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I believe that or admnistrator or the author bloked all....

--- 帖子 #18 ---
it's a bug with ff right now. be patient and they should be back soon.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi neal, i am signing in late, nevertheless, this is your faithful follower reporting for duty. welldone on all the hard work. best of luck on your quest.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Neal, just a couple of points. First, in your instructions, at one point you say: "Now as common sense would tell us, the EMA's are moving all the time. That's where an EA comes in to monitor them and adjust them till one is penetrated." ... But nowhere do you indicate you are using EMA's, only SMA's. This is probably just a typo, so hopefully you can fix it ... Or you can point out how blind I am, since I don't see it. More importantly, in a case where the price overflows the channel/river, your objective is the 89SMA, right? But what is the SL? Maybe you haven't decided yet? And, one last question. You say buy or sell on the cross of the 89SMA. I presume you mean on the close of the candle crossing the 89SMA -- but you don't specify, so I thought I would ask. Maybe there could/should be a threshold beyond, so that a longer candle can get us in before the close? That's going to kill us in backtesting, but I'm already seeing, you know, 50 pip 15 minute candle breaks the 89SMA, and your system wouldn't have us jump in until it closes 40 pips beyond the trigger line... then it only continues 8 pips, only to reverse and stop us out with a loss. Same old story... I'm getting teary eyed just thinking about it :. Thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Neal, attached a chart showing us not to trade on non-farm-days... I found some more exciting days where this method would have failed several times. But here some suggestions: Why not add some more fib levels to the SMA and use the 13 SMA as an entry signal? I propose to go short when 13 SMA crosses a fib level ABOVE the 89 SMA and vice versa. Or going short (and vice versa) when price breaks below a level and the 13SMA changes slope for a certain amount of pips in the direction of the trade? This could be used as filter: Slope change 4pips - no trade, slope change 8 pips - trade. Maybe we are touched too much by fibonacci? Why not other numbers? Gann for instance used square numbers and roots: 4-9-16-25-36 and so on. Maybe we'll get better results. It would be great to develop an EA which let's us play around with levels and there numbers. When playing around with the mid-SMA, try 55 with 55 as additional levels to the 89. The suggested method is great - maybe one should predetermine the trend on a higher timeframe and take trades only in one direction, avoiding whipsaws. Sorry for the idea tsunami

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I added rsi and supernova as a filter

--- 帖子 #23 ---
1) Tried GOLD - MA's will not go high enough to work on a chart - lol 2) GBP/JPY - I added a template quest100v_1.0gj.tpl to post #1 (requires higher settings than the base pairs. Haven't tried it with any other than the base pairs, USD/CAD and GPB/JPY.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
There is an "offset" (DANGER AREA) close to the 89SMA that it will not initiate a trade - this filters some whiplash. Right now it's looking like +55 and -55 from the 89SMA may be where it ends up (i.e. no trades are started in that range).

--- 帖子 #25 ---
EMA was a typo - have corrected - should have been SMA When the price flows over the banks, the TakeProfit is set to zero and then the StopLoss acts as a trailing stop. The amount will be determined after backtesting but it looks like it will be about 15-25pips. The EA is looking GREAT! at this point, just need a little more testing and then will release. You'll be amazed what it's doing!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Once I get it up and running I'll test a few NFP days to see what happens. Instinct tells me we will be fine due to the buffer zone arround the 89SMA. It may go into a trade the wrong way and loose a little, but then will catch it going back down on the other side and make a bigger profit than the loss was.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Good day Neal. Thanks for the system .... I tried GOLD . adding level 1597, 987 and 610 ( + / -) to MA 89... It works great ....thanks

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks for the help - got me pointed in the right direction. My mistake was changing the 89 - but it needs to remain the same. Fib figures for template are 1597 &amp; 610 (89 &amp; 13 remains the same). Template posted in post #1

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I can't tell you how excited I am to see that the indicators are appearing to be "universal" (work on many varied pairs with just a few modifications). It's nice to see the market follow the same principals throughout the different pairs. Keep in mind that if you "tweak" a template for a pair that I haven't listed and wish to post it, the only thing I ask is the values be Fib numbers. When manually trading the indicators, you will find that you want as many pairs as practical to observe - say perhaps 8. This way you can pick the trades with the highest probability for success. This is when the candles OVERFLOW the banks of the river, take a trade in the opposite direction. What I did today (manually) was take an OVERFLOW trade on the EUR/USD and the GBP/USD and on the second candle ABOVE the 13SMA I set a 25pip trailing stop and forgot about them. These were the most "stressLESS" trades I have ever done. I wasn't worried in the least that they would result in profit. Sure enough - it wasn't much (guess I should have set it to 35 pips TS) but EUR/USD was +16 and GBP/USD was +18pips. They are still moving in an upward direction! By the way.... the EA v1.0 (almost ready - found a bug or two while backtesting) would still be in the trade below. It uses a "buffer zone" below the 13SMA of about 25. This means that it has to fall 25 pips BELOW the 13SMA before it will exit the trade. By observing the 13SMA by scrolling BACK on a chart, you will see that sometimes consolidation takes place and may move down under the 13SMA then start going back up again.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Here's an example of how the EA v1.0 reverses when a river BANK is hit. (forgive the crude image, but was taken from the EA results and didn't want to take the time to pretty it up) The white lines are the +89 -89 SMA levels (river banks). You notice at the bottom it sensed the -89SMA breached and went into a BUY. In this case it was stopped out because it continued down (will be compensated for in the next version of the EA). Then it went back into a BUY. Once it passed the 89 in the middle of the river, it was stopped out due to the consilidation, but when the market started moving again, it went right back in with a BUY then continued to the top and AUTOMATICALLY REVERSED direction again. Finally exiting the trade after crossing the 89 in the middle when it sensed the market changing direction. Total PROFIT from all of these trades (including the bad one at the beginning) was +177 pips. P.S. By the way, if the EA is currently in a trade when one of the banks are overflowed (+89 &amp; -89 SMA) it automaticlly goes into Trailing Stop mode and rides it up past the bank till it reverses (using a tight 15pip TS) then performs the AutoReverse.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Alright Neal, roll EA Version 1 out and let's have a look........... What pairs do you reccommend from your back testing ?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I am testing/optimizing based on USD/JPY - the other 3 majors need testing as well as GBP/JPY. Think that should suit most peoples needs. Got some of the bugs fixed and will be releasing in the morning for sure (getting too late and am having a hard time concentrating - lol). You are not going to believe some of the back testing results! Neal

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Alright Neal sounds good. Can you please post the exact set-up in terms of indicators,templates, and EA in order and tell us exactly what currency pair to try this on. I must admit I too have been a little confused following things this time around. One question Neal. You say that if one does this manually, one should buy if the market is above the 89 line and sell if below the 89 line. Are you specifically talking about the close of a candle above or below the 89 line so as to indicate when this would be a Buy or Sell ?? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Short usdjpy at 108.04

--- 帖子 #36 ---
same thing as before, once released i will put it on my work MT4 24/5 and let it run

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Nice method, am going over the strategy slightly, just to see what can be added/subtracted/edited. So far I am just trying to re-define entry rules.. To avoid the double bursted banks. But it looks pretty damn good.. Nice job neal.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I have made some minor changes to the templates in post #1 to help make things clearer. 1) quest100v_1.1.tpl - Levels +34 and -34 were changed to +20 and -20 and the color is now red. This level (+20 &amp; -20) was determend after doing a 6 month backtest. 2) quest100v_1.1gj.tpl &amp; quest100v_1.1gold.tpl - levels remain the same, just changed color to red. The RED lines are the "buffer zone" (i.e. DO NOT ENTER A TRADE ZONE). Once a candle has CLOSED outside the RED lines it is a 75% chance you are safe to enter a trade in that direction with high probability that it will continue in that direction (hopefully reaching the +89 and -89 level (banks of river) in order to take a nice profit).

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Seeing examples is the best way most people learn something new. Here is a chart of a trade I took this morning. The SAFEST entries in this entire system is to catch the retracement AFTER the market has went OUTSIDE the banks of the river (+89 &amp; -89 levels - brown lines). Once a candle closes BELOW the 13SMA then enter the trade in that direction. I entered a little early..... When trading manually, I put a 35pip Trailing Stop on it and forget about it. The desired target will be the 89SMA (blue line in middle), but of course it can go further than that.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Nice, entry with SMA13, it looks similiar to Gann Hi Lo entry signal, change is that you wouldnt use SMA13 close and price cross as entry singal but in this case when price closes below SMA13 low, but if it functions this way why change it

--- 帖子 #41 ---
IMPORTANT: Keep in mind this may not behave as demonstrated in backtesting.... We are moving from the backtesting phase to forward testing. Sometimes things act different than planned. The Expert Adviser v1.0 is now stable enough and meets the minimum requirements outlined in post #1 (mainly doesn't loose more than $1,000 in a given month - only tested the past 7 months though). BACKTESTING RESULTS Just the figures for now...... $1,928 profit - July 2007 $3,221 profit - August 2007 $306 profit - September 2007 $772 LOSS - October 2007 $3,207 profit - November 2007 $1,204 profit - December 2007 Period July 2007 - January 2008 totals: Pair: USD/JPY $8,361 Profit Results: http://26z.net/forex/10.htm REMEMBER - this is just v1.0 I know there are a lot of missed trades, premature exits, etc. The main point is you have something to play with that we can feel fairly safe it won't blow an account or make gross errors in judgment. v1.1 will have many of these problems corrected and have much better performance and profit. EA is located on post #1 SETTINGS NOTE: EA - not for use on GOLD or GBP/JPY till v1.2 (settings are different) Most things (stop losses, trailing stops, etc. are handled by logic in the EA) MagicNumber = 304323 MUST BE UNIQUE to this EA (i.e. not the same number as any other EA's you might have running) == Start Time == BeginHour =8 (GMT) (defaults determined through 6 month backtesting) EndHour =15 (GMT) GMTOffset =2 (your broker's difference from GMT) == Main Settings == Sensitivity =18 DO NOT ENTER TRADES above &amp; below this number from the 89SMA (buffer zone - false signals) StopLoss =35 Stop loss from when a signal is triggered before taking out the trade StopDistance =30 Has several uses, mainly as a trailing stop autoreverse =true Automatically reverse a trade when it goes outside the +89 &amp; -89 levels (banks of river) CloseOrdersDaily =false Close all trades at 00:00 each day (not recommended or tested) == Money Management == Lots =1 Lot size for each trade (i.e. 1.0, .01, .1) MoneyManagement =false Use money management routines Risk =10 Percent of account balance to risk on a trade NOTE: You may do like I did, and put the EA immedieatly on a chart. If it thinks the conditions are right it may go directly into a trade (even though they aren't ideal). While testing be aware of this and perhaps start the EA either inside the red lines (+20 &amp; -20) or outside the brown ones (+89 &amp; -89). I'll try to get it to where it doesn't enter immediately on v1.2.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Neal, This is a great work from a great mind. I dough my cap for you and am 150% sure of success. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
EA managed Trailing Stops &amp; Stop Losses. Just to let you know, the EA only updates TS and SL every 15 minutes (not like a normal mode of every tick). They should change (if needed) at ??:00, ??:15, ??:30 and ??:45 Under normal circumstances this is adequate. I may build in a sensor that if the market starts moving fast (i.e. if last candle was greater than 30 pips) it shifts into 5 minute mode temporarily. This cuts down on hundereds of modify orders when it is in every tick mode. Neal

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Neal, thanks for great work! The ea isnt working at all for me, can you send me your preset file please?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Will not let me attach the preset file, but here are the default settings: MagicNumber=304323 Remark1=== Start Time == BeginHour=8 EndHour=15 GMTOffset=2 Remark2=== Main Settings == Sensitivity=18 StopLoss=35 StopDistance=30 autoreverse=1 CloseOrdersDaily=0 Remark3=== Money Management == Lots=0.10000000 MoneyManagement=0 Risk=10

--- 帖子 #46 ---
FINDING YOUR BROKER OFFSET FROM GMT (for use when setting your GMTOffset paramater in the EA) Go to: http://fxtrade.oanda.com/resources/fxmarkethours/ Set the time zone to GMT,WET Observe the current GMT time (right below where you selected from the drop down menu) Now in your MetaTrader look at the "Market Watch" window (top left window) which has the different rates ticking away. Your brokers time is at the top of that window. If GMT says 01:00 and your broker says 03:00 then you have a +2 offset If GMT says 01:00 and your broker says 00:00 then you have a -1 offset You would add/subtract the offset from the BeginHour setting of 10:00 to give you the correct EA start time.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Nealc thanks for your fantastic work !!! So' if GMT is 01.00 and broker time is 01.00 , do i live 0 in gmt settings ?? thanks. For example ODL looks gmt on their platform ,so' i put 0 in gmt settings.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes .... GMT is equil to 0 offset.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I have noticed some problems with the AutoReverse function - it was working but is not working in v1.0 I'll troubleshoot and make some enhancements and try to have v1.1 ready by Monday. LOL - Now you see one reason why I restricted it to only run on a DEMO account. I wanted to be able to sleep at night at least knowing you weren't trading REAL money. By the way, had 3 good trades and 2 loss with v1.0 this morning. EURUSD -35pips GBPUSD -35pips USDJPY +51pips USDCAD +38pips USDCHF +76pips (and still open) NOTE: Keep in mind that these started when the EA was placed on the chart (which in EURUSD was not the best timing).

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Does restricting it to Demo accounts stop it from working on an off line strategy tester?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
No. Just restricts you from using it on a LIVE account.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thanks Neal I copied your settigns and now the EA seems to work, however, it is placing no orders, instead I notice this in under the Experts Tab "2008.02.21 23:23:16 Quest100_v1.0 GBPUSD,H1: 1.9625 SELL: sl: 1.9629 tp: 1.9497 "

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Neal. Fantastic work. You truly are a very smart person coming up with this. I'm sure you'll soon have V1.1 tweaked in no time. Just a a couple of questions please. I'm trying to set the proper starting time for this to work. If GMT.WET ( Oanda ) says 8pm and the time on Market Wat Does mean that the closing time should be adjusted to 14 GMTch (IBFX) says 19.00, then am I right that I should adjust the starting hour by -1 ?? In other words, the setting for the EA is for 7 GMT and not for 8 and the closing time should be 14 GMT and not 15 GMT ? Also:- Am I right in saying that Quest100v1.1 is the correct template to use on all currency pairs except for GBP/JPY ?? I currently have it set up on USD/JPY.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
That is just some debugging code - but "SELL" indicates to me that it should have tried to place a sell. Anyone else running the EA and it not opening trades (hasn't opend any for a while today).

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Setting broker GMT offset can be confusing sometimes. I think yours is 1 - I know mine is 2 and my broker time is currently 21:39. I assume you tried the post related to "trying" to demystify GMT offset http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=46 Template: Yes 1.1 is current - I only keep the current one posted as not to confuse people. Have only tested EA with 4 majors and USD/CAD. It will not work currently with GBP/JPY or GOLD due to the volitility. I have to make some adjustments in the EA to accomidate them. You can tell if the EA should work with a pair by putting the basic template (quest100_v1.1.tpl) on it. For example if you put that template on GBPJPY or GOLD you'll see exactlly what I mean.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Neal, I'm waiting for x50 indicator and EA to be finished but I'm also testing yours. Just had a buy on USDCHF. Buy @ 1.0882 My first EA trade...demo or live. I'm liking it and it's the only way I'm going to find the time to trade. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Cheers Neal.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
That will be a good retracement trade. The EA will take care of all the stop losses &amp; take profits for you. With luck on your side it will at least go up to the 89SMA blue line.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Trade is now +19 and on it's way back up to 89SMA. The profit target is moving down as the 89SMA moves down. Interesting. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks to great minds behind the success of this thread. Pls im having problem with the "session" indicator and the EA. Do they work with meta4? I ve loaded them in my expert file but still have problem with uploading. Can someone help me out? I dont know what is wroung with all the pictures posted in this thread. I cant see the pictures. I will also appreciate more explanation on the entry and exit rules of this system. Thankx in advance!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
i found your EA after work, i will place it tomorrow

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Just a point of correction to above post. When I say pictures I mean those ones attached to the system desciptions. Pls nealc99, can u help with the pictures you posted? I found no picture after opening. Still need help with the entry and exit rules.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I have never used and EA before. I have attached it to my chart with the settings supplied here in the thread. How do I know if it is on. It is showing and x and not the smiley face I see in the charts posted. Thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Smiley face would indicate it is on. 1) At the top of your Metatrader there is a button that says "Expert Advisors", it should be GREEN and sunken 2) click on the X of the EA in the upper right corner of your chart and on the first tab "Common", down at the bottom "Live Trading" should be checked.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Does the current EA version follow your 13SMA rule? Other than using the EA, do you have any re-entry rules or would you wait for another signal whereby the entry rules are met?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks

The only re-entry at this time for the EA would be retracement from either brown line (+89 &amp; -89 SMA) back to the 89SMA. For manual trading, if you get stopped out (say 35pip trailing stop) once the candles have started gravitating back to the 89SMA you could possibly go back in. DO NOT REENTER if it is close to danger zone (right now set to 18pips above and below the 89SMA). There tends to be a lot of whipsawing arround the 89SMA.

Hi Neal, Using your presets I have the EA set on a 1h UJ chart on my demo account and its been on for last 10 hours with no trades. Any ideas what could be the reason? Is it because it will place a trade only between 8 and 15 GMT ? Below are the entries from experts tab. Thanks once again 2008.02.22 08:59:12 Quest100_v1.0 USDJPY,H1 inputs: MagicNumber=304329; Remark1="== Start Time =="; BeginHour=8; EndHour=15; GMTOffset=2; Remark2="== Main Settings =="; Sensitivity=18; StopLoss=35; StopDistance=30; autoreverse=true; CloseOrdersDaily=false; Remark3="== Money Management =="; Lots=1; MoneyManagement=false; Risk=10; 2008.02.22 08:59:12 Quest100_v1.0 USDJPY,H1: NOTICE: This EA does not function on a LIVE account - ONLY Demo!!!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Correct - Default settings is 8:00-15:00 GMT You may have put it on after 15:00 GMT therefore it's not looking for anything.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
1hr or 15m? I thought it's suppose to be on the 15 minute chart.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
The EA is hard wired for a 15 minute - doesn't matter what timeframe the chart it is on. (of course the signals won't visually match if different than a 15m chart)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Guys, someone is using ODL to test the ea ? I am having problems : when a position is open ,all is in order ,then SL and TP disappear and also the position remain open forever......

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi Nealc ,why the ea didn't open this long trade on euro ? in the same time opened usdjpy short Thanks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
The EA is in development... You cannot expect it to be perfect from the start edit : EA lost 90$ but has 200$ in floating gain. Weird thing is that it has a +96 pips gain on GBPCHF but the SL and TP has been removed after some time ? Is it how it is supposed to work ? (note : the TP set originaly would have been hit by now )

--- 帖子 #76 ---
You have had my same problems.......but at least your ea is opening different positions with different pairs.... ps. my ea dasn't update for the triling stop ps.what i can see now is that ea makes one trade per time in the same platform

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Yes - it's in developmental stage.But, it looks like it should have.TRADE ENTRY: (Close of current candle &gt;= EMA89+Sensitivity) &amp;&amp; (Close of previous candle &gt;= EMA89+Sensitivity*Point) &amp;&amp; (Open 2nd previous candle &lt; EMA89+Sensitivity*Point) = ENTER BUY

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Entry into a trade is fairly straight forward.MAINTAINING and EXITING a trade on the other hand gets a little complicated sometimes.A SL should be in place almost all of the time (can't think of an exception at the moment).The TP is removed when a candle overflows the river banks (+89/-89) to allow it to shift into TrailingStop mode (we don't care how far it goes in the positive direction). The SL is moved on a tight 15pip threshold so we can drain all the pips possible out of the trade when it reverses.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
The EA will make only 1 trade per "MagicNumber". If you have the EA on several charts, check to see that the MagicNumber is different on each. That's how the EA knows which trades belong to it.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Unfortunately i think there is something wrong in the code as ATM i have this trade with no stop nor take profit ? Also, i see in my log one trade that went up to +40 but closed à -35 Some orders SL has been moved once but until now no trade has closed in profit... Edit : Another trade (eurusd) closed à -9 after going to +45... The EA needs some work on the exit strategy but i think i has a lot of potential...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I am releasing an "interim" EA Quest100_v1.01 which has several bugs and logic fixes. It is on Post #1. Be sure before removing the old EA you make note of what the MagicNumber you used was so you can use the same number on Quest100_v1.01 Version v1.1 will be sometime next week - not going to rush it like I did v1.0 now that there is at least an EA out there. I need to think outside of the box and not be trapped by the normal thinking of setting an EA with fixed StopLoss/TakeProfit levels based on backtesting. Results from the past 3-6 months are no indication as to what went on in the past 60 minutes. It needs to be intelligent enough to "scale" the TP/SL according to the momentum of the current market. Finding an entry point isn't the difficult part of a sucessful system, finding the propper EXIT is the goose that laid the golden egg.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Looks like a good strategy, reminds me of Firebird strategy, I will forward test with your EA and post feedback. Enclosed you will find an E/U chart with a short trade opened. My understanding is that the EA should wait for the 13 SMA to close below -20 SMA to place the sell trade? Note: I was very late on setting up the charts and the buy trade was entered late and was stopped out. Stop loss is working perfectly. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi nealc thanks for explanations.....so' if i want trade many pairs in the same platform do i have to change magic number for each pair ? Thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #84 ---
That's correct. A MagicNumber tells an EA what trades belong to it. So you could do something like this: Chart 1 - EUR/JPY - Magic#: 101 Chart 2 - USD/JPY - Magic#: 102 Chart 3 - GBP/USD - Magic#: 103 Putting the same (or different) EA's on a chart and giving them a different MagicNumber allows them to trade independently of one another. Once the EA is in a stable condition, this will be the way you will want to run for LIVE trading. This way it gives you more trading opportunities. My theory is to get a good EA that reliablly earns 20-30 pips a day and put it on multiple currencies. That way 20-30 pips/day on 4 pairs = 80-120pips/day (100 pips/day is my goal). Of course by accident since you are already in a trade, there will be times 1 pair might make 50-100 pips all on it's own if it is open in the right direction when the market decided to make a big move.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
yes, otherwise the EA will totally f*ck up ^^

--- 帖子 #86 ---
thanks for the help guys

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't I have a TP on this?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Yes. It was a bug in v1.0 (sometimes it didn't). v1.01 corrects that (but may not put one on an existing trade. Once it starts moving in the right direction it will begin updating the SL &amp; TP then it will have one.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Neal I had it running last night with 50/50 success. Basically, I had profits on USD/CHF, EUR/JPY and USD/JPY. The EUR/USD pair was a disaster. Neal. What pairs do you reccommend using the standard template ?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
The EA is being developed on the USD/JPY pair specifically. I don't have a problem with running it on the 4 majors - any pair may have good/bad days. The goal would be to have a positive gain amoungst the pairs you are trading.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Well it's a very good EA that's for sure. I basically left all the above pairs running from 9 GMT - 16 GMT (IBFX) which corresponds to my settings with Oanda . Well done on a great start Neal. I'll be trialing V1.01 on Monday. By the way, and excuse my ignorance here, but what is the Gold template for ? I think this may be your best EA yet and it can only get better.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
GOLD is a precious metal that some brokers allow you to trade like a currency pair. It is based on the price of Gold and is very volatile. Your broker may not have it available to trade.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Looks like I won't be trading Gold then !

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Just as a matter of interest Neal, what pairs have you identified during your analysis that are more favourable apart from USD/JPY ?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
The "templates" look like the same principals fit throught the 4 majors. As for backtesting I do it on USD/JPY. As for forward testing I'm doing the 4 majors and USD/CAD. GBP/JPY and GOLD are not currently supported by the EA but will be in the future (probabbly 2-3 versions from now). The GJ and GOLD templates indicate they somewhat follow the same patterns, it's just the setting have to be dramatically increased for them.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Same here, i will put it on a new account (again ^^ nealc work too fast ) on monday so the statement is clean.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Excuse me, but the templates on page 1 are not downloadable.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
They don't download like EA's do. Template downoad instructions: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...1&amp;postcount=26 By the way, has anyone seen "How to" movies on how to download/install a template or EA? Would be nice to add them to the reference area in post #1. I know several people have problems with it. If not, all you Camtasia people out there get to work and make one! LOL (p.s. and don't ask what Camtasia is if you don't know). Neal

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Here's one on installing an EA. Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hmm.... I hate it when I have these off the wall ideas to solve problems. PROBLEM: Backtesting to produce average parameters over a period of time (i.e. 6mo or 1yr) to use as current settings for a forward operating EA. POSSIBLE SOLUTION: How about a "self-optimizing" EA that daily reviews say the past 3 days data to recalculate the optimum settings to use. This gives fresh settings based on recent activity to hopefully closer anticipate future patterns. Just food for thought - in my gut I feel I can code it, but we'll see FEED BACK REQUEST: Do you think 3 days is enough, or should it be 7 days, 1 month? What are your feelings. Keep in mind if you go too far back you lose the "freshness" of what's happening in today's market.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Neal nice work on the ea. How about 5 days. That seems to be a good starting point. Not to long and not to short.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
How about a winning EA designed especially for the AUD/USD and NZD/USD markets, Neal ? Not an easy task. Neal. When will you be releasing the final non demo Quest version ?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Standard template (Questv_1.1) found on Post #1 appears to fit correctly on AUD/USD &amp; NZD/USD so the EA currently will work with them. Out of DEMO phase will probably not be for 30 days yet - it is too new and too temperamental to be traded on a LIVE account at this time. EA v1.1 will be a lot more profitable than v1.01 is. Not sure when v1.1 will be available. Trying to shoot for Tuesday - but may be later. Need to have a day or two of forward testing before release. Things act differently with forward data than it backtesting.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Neal, Do you have an indicator in MQ 4 format for this method as I would like to trade this manually. The method looks very sound &amp; I'd like to give it a go, but not much into ea's. Thanks for sharing. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #105 ---
By the way Neal, do the starting and ending hours need to be changed for the other pairs ? I'm just running your system at the times stipulated by yourself (with adjustment). Yes, I agree, I'd want to be reasonably comfortable knowing that it has a good chance of winning before applying it to a real money account. What can you do to improve on 1.01 ? It is a good system but may be more suitable to certain pairs only.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Don't have an indicator, but the templates are listed in Post #1 which can give you visual indicatiors as when to get into a trade. Like system, getting out relys on your existing exit strategies you may use.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Times: I would say the times should be ok - most volume of trading is done in the London/USA sessions. Tweaking EA: You could run a backtest checking different values for Sensitivity , StopLoss and StopDistance . These are what would effect the current pair your may be trading (I'd say a 3 month backtest).

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Neal, Thanks for the reply. I'lll give that a try.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
cheers

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thank you Vincent for asking about the AUD/USD &amp; NZD/USD. While looking at those pairs with the template zoomed way out, I seen a pattern that I hadn't seen with it zoomed in. It's funny how the mind focuses on looking for a specific thing and completely misses something obvious (just because your not looking for it). On a regular basis, there is retracement that we could be taking advantage of. When the market goes ABOVE the +18 level of the 89SMA and then starts back down, it many times will go down to the -18 level of the 89SMA. This may be a prime opportunity for buys/sells on retracement. PLUS it's the "launching pad" for when the market moves to the +89/-89 levels of the 89SMA (brown lines - banks of the river). P.S. - I accidently put -20/+20 on the image instead of -18/+18

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hello Everyone, For some reason I'm having trouble manually applying the SMA 89 as explain in Post #2. Would some expain how to do this. I thought I knew, but so far not able to apply them to the chart. I would like to give this method a try trading it manually &amp; not with the EA. Thanks for any help given. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Now THAT is interesting, I'll have a close look at that Neal !

--- 帖子 #113 ---
By the way Neal that chart you put up is the USD/JPY chart and not the NZD/USD or AUD/USD

--- 帖子 #114 ---
That's a benifit - means it happens in other pairs as well. Spotted it on NZD/USD and AUD/USD when I was testing the template levels.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hope the attached images help - I know Levels can be confusing sometimes till you've done them once.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Good catch. I will look more into this.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Neal, Check out this link for auto optimization. It is from the mql website. Not sure if it can help you. Maybe it will. http://articles.mql4.com/506 Jeff

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Very intereting reading - will see if I might be able to integrate it somehow (may be a version or two from now). Neal

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Neal. Can you please improve on your demo and upload a file for "live trading". I like your EA even though I don't reccommend it for all pairs.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Working on it - LOL We will be going in "baby steps" with DEMO for a few weeks. v1.1 will contain a single profitable strategy. The first strategy is where the market is REPELLED by the 13SMA and stays it's distance. Once the market turns, exit the trade. An EA environment is like the River we trade. It has many trades (fish) that move arround in it. When we introduce a new breed (strategy) we first must be sure that the new breed doesn't disturb the old breed's environment and cause it to suffer negative consequences.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
NealC99, Thanks for that help. The only experience I had with MA's has been 2-3 EMA's I used in the past, but never needed to set the + or - on those. This method looks really good &amp; I will try it this week. Thanks for sharing. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #122 ---
thanks for the method....i think no need to modify....dont fix the perfect thing or it become flawless...the heart of this system is the level itself... help me alot to book my profit by seeing the price tension.... thank you again....

--- 帖子 #123 ---
There's always room for improvement SEVEN. if you don't want to see it improved just use the current EA. I'd rather see Neal work his magic.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Nealc , this is morning update with v1.01 version

--- 帖子 #125 ---
New version 1.01 you are fast, my computer at home is still running 1.00 will change it when I get back home

--- 帖子 #126 ---
hi neal, well done on all your efforts. you have really done a good job. but please can you put up a brief explanation again as to how to trade this system manually. what is my entry codition? my exit and stoploss if possible u can illustrate with a pictorial example. i am sorry to draw you back, but i tried reading the explantion on the first post but didnt understand it. thank you.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Update : entered short also gbpusd just a consideration : at this point i am up about + 140 pips , so' i can close all positions manually and done for today.....

--- 帖子 #128 ---
The 1.01 is working brillantly today up around 240 pips with a mix of several pairs. I let it run without closing the position as the point is also to test the closing functionnality of the EA and the trailing functionnality. Some orders are up a lot of pips but the EA has yet to update the SL to at least BE... For example audcad went up to +45 but the SL has not been updated yet. Does the Risk = 10 has an impact on this ?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
To manually close positions would negate meaning of EA, also it would give so much variation in results it wouldnt make any sense, just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
i said that because i see people trying to give an insight and likely trying to modified it without fully understanding the system itself... i welcomed any improvement and I AM waiting for it...but people pleaese study the heart of the method before u pop up with said to be a brilliant idea...my word is no offend

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Risk is only used when MoneyManagement=TRUE. It will use 10% of your remaining balance for each trade. Well done! Neal

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well done on your 2nd chart!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I agree when "testing" an EA. When "using" an EA to make money, the human has so much more knowlege of things an EA may not be programmed for that closing manually is a good idea. Let's say your coming up on a Daily/Monthly Support/Resestance barirer. The EA doesn't know that and it might be a good idea to keep an eye on things and close out manually depending on where the market goes.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
So is there any settings that would impact how quickly the EA will modify the SL ? Now the EA has closed 4 orders for +33 (mixed between loss and win) and has +190 is floating gain but a position soon to be closed @ -45 pip ) I think you should try to implement a SL based on a calculation rather than a fixed value (if i understand well your different statements and the extern values of the EA )

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I see that you had a couple of orders placed with out the T/P set. Was that you that set it, or is the new version of the EA still doing this? Thanks

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I agree! But for those that can't be at there computer all day, is it possible to have an option where the EA will close all trades when a certain % of equity balance is acheived or a specified amount of total pips?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
"StopDistance" has influence on the stop loss. It is the amout of pips + or - from the 13EMA. Stops start updating once the market is under/over the 13EMA and the trade is in profit.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Be sure you are useing v1.01 Version 1.1 will not have T/P - it will be based on exiting a trade based on various strategies (i.e. crosses back over the 13EMA in the other direction is one of them).

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Will keep that ability in mind during development.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Looks like he was using 1.01. But still no T/P set on 2 orders. No biggie if the new version will not have them anyway. Thanks for all your hard work!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Just had a look on 2 orders that closed with a small loss (-4 and -1 ) and they went respectively to +66 and +45 before reversing. I will let the EA run for at least two weeks but for what i see untill now SL logic needs refinement I think as an additional, we would be a good idea to set a value of winning from which at least BE should be set (for example 30 pips in gain =&gt; BE ) My personnal strategy is to allways enter at least .2 lots, close .1 @ +30 and set BE on the residual order and let it run.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I am using version v1.01 and ea deleted the TP at one point ... i didn't modified anything

--- 帖子 #143 ---
People. What are the best pairs to use this system with ? I personally have found the USD/JPY and EUR/JPY to be quite good. It's been a bad day for 1.01 I'm afraid. The fundamentals have really hit the different pairs quite hard. As usual the EUR/USD has performed miserably. Neal, we need a better version.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Yes we need people's input as to what are the best settings and pairs to use for this EA.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Neal what's that link to Oanda 's clock again for setting the time in line with my Broker ?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Forex Clock: http://fxtrade.oanda.com/resources/fxmarkethours/ I appreciate the turmoil the market has been in today (due to testing). Testing v1.1 and am making several adjustments in logic. Getting IN trades is fine, it the aborting bad ones and maximising profit logic that is best adjusted in forward testing. Todays results: Quest100_v1.1 EA (in testing) 2008.02.25 10:00 sell gbpusd @ 1.9624 to 1.9633 -9 pips 2008.02.25 12:15 buy usdchf @ 1.0906 to 1.0861 -45 pips (stopped out) 2008.02.25 11:48 sell usdcad @ 1.0081 to 1.0015 +66 pips 2008.02.25 12:00 buy usdjpy @ 107.74 to 107.83 +9 pips 2008.02.25 16:00 buy eurusd 1.4830 to 1.4830 +0 pips 2008.02.25 16:00 buy @ gbpusd 1.9685 to 1.9678 -7 pips 2008.02.25 15:45 sell @ usdchf 1.0867 to 1.0873 -6 pips Net +8 pips (at least it wasn't a loseing day - lol) Have made some adjustments to take out of a trade sooner so hopefully will be better tomarrow (trade hour settings for this version is currently 8:00-18:00). With the exception of the one that was just a plain old bad trade (even from manual standpoint), at least the losses are small.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Result closed for me +70 pips and +170 is floating so it would have been +240 and even +300 if i had close some trade instead of letting the EA manage it but that does not matter. The more important thing is to see if the EA can be positive week after week without any human intervention. For the moment, it is set on a lot of pairs (12 pairs) but without any specific settings except eurgbp. Also i have set the open/close hour from 1 to 23 instead of the default.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
There's a GOOD setup coming (to trade manually). USD/CAD Once the candle CLOSES above both the 13SMA and the -89 level (brown line) it will be back inside the river banks and headed up! Enter trade and once +30 profit set a 25pip trailing stop and forget about it. Taking retracement from the outer banks (-89 &amp; +89 levels --- brown lines) are the safest trades in this whole strategy. Also DON'T PANIC on these if you get in and it goes down 20-30 pips.... it will come back.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Nealc your ea opened perfectly this long trade usdcad

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Well I'm an FX Dealer Neal so I can tell you that the Fundamentals will always be a "thorn in the side" of any EA based on technicals. In saying that losses can be minimized. There is some important reports due out of the US later this week so expect increased volatility.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
And.... there is absolutely nothing wrong with manually closing any EA's trades according to one's own management plan. EAs are just tools, like indicators, patterns, price action, etc... We are not to be "owned" by them... That said, I'm all for brilliance in this EA!! And we all simply have to give Neal TIME.... no push for a "better" EA, he's already doing that. No push for a "live" EA... he's already doing that to... nice, supportive, constructive feedback... that is what is helpful at this point... As a fellow EA developer, let him breath and work... after all, it's all free, GEEZ!!!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
absolutely agree, but premature closing could damage your money management - alot of traders have this problem, when they see even small profit they close the trade and bank it, but when there is loss they let it ride and ruin their acc. Since there is a stop loss in this system there is no danger in some losses getting too big, but if you close every so often too early it could reduce profits. Of course if there is some great resistance on the road of open trades and trade is in profit but all other circumstances show that it is more likely to fail then close it by all means.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Whoa Several small looser and some big winners. But it has -47 floating loss atm. It definitely has issue moving faster the SL but i see a lot potential. I have to say that the strategy is good from the beginning. Edit : crap, for unkown reasons my account is not valid anymore using Mig demo server :/ I have to create a new one and start from scratch again...

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I'm still here people Even though I'm off in the background trying to tweak v1.1 in forward testing I haven't forgotten about you. Believe me, a SUCCESSFUL EA is the heaviest thing on my mind as well at the moment. I have a FUNDED LIVE account sitting in the background just dieing to be traded, so I have motivation to make this thing work. I have learned TONS of things in the process of developing this method and some of them I'll be sharing with you in the near future. Would you think I was deranged to tell you that EMA's have "Oras" - LOL - will show you what I mean in the near future. Right now I'm analyzing to see if the "Oras" have any correlation with each other and how they interact when you have more than 1 EMA in operation. This may be an important key to keeping us OUT of bad trades and getting INTO good trades earlier. Well sometimes it takes a deranged person to "think outside the box" and not operate within the walls of conventional thinking. How do you think we have some of the wonderful indicators we have today.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hello Neal and all, Could someone explain to me why this particular trade was triggered? I am using the most recent EA with defaults settings except for the gmt adjustment. If you look below you will see that it was triggered at 10:15....I don't see the logic behind it based on the entry rules per Neal. Please correct me if I am mistaken. Thanks

--- 帖子 #156 ---
The price broke the EMA more than X pips and the short was triggered.... I guess :? +90$ in floating gain on the new account.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
The EA is evolving and being refined faster than the template is updated (my bad). There is a DANGER ZONE arround the 89SMA (+20/-20) where you get a lot of whipsaw so it will not initiate a trade in that zone even if it has a valid signal. Once it is past the danger zone and BELOW the 13SMA it looks for 2 PREVIOUS LOWER HIGHS (to further establish a down trend) then it enters the trade. That appears to be what is seen in the chart.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Neal, No complains from this end...just sharing information in case it helps you with your efforts (thank you). I understand the danger zone but what I don't understand is why did it enter?......it did not crossed the 89sma(signal line) nor did it go outside the river bank....sorry if I am being thick! Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
No problem. It is good to have constructive input and to explain why something enters. It might have been that it wasn't supposed to enter and I needed to correct it. There are several types of trades it can take, "outside" the river banks (+89/-89) is just one of them (and the best one).

--- 帖子 #160 ---
EA v1.1 Status EA is doing fairly well today. Am at approximately +46 pips with no open trades at the moment. Have a few more minor adjustments to make in forward testing to get us in trades SOONER, then will release (target tomorrow sometime). Am trading 4 majors &amp; USD/CAD.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi NealC99 &amp; Everyone, I know this might be off topic EA wise, but took a short on $/Y this morning on the cross of the centerline &amp; still in @ +31 pips. Have limit set &amp; will tp when hit. For the most part I'm not a big fan of EA's, but this just might be worthwhile. Looking forward to hearing the final results of NEAL'S &amp; EVERYONES hard work. Nothing like good teamwork to make a plan come together. Thanks for sharing. " THE HOLY GRAIL IS NOT THE METHOD TRADED, BUT THE TRADER" Ace Trader

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Congratulations! Just keep in mind - the "danger zone" (+20/-20 level off the 89SMA - blue line) has earned it's reputation through backtestig. There is a lot of whipsawing in that zone while the market decides which direction it wants to go next.

Several PRIME trades coming up! GBP/USD (see chart) USD/CAD USD/CHF (may signal in the next few hours) EUR/USD (may signal in the next few hours) GBP/USD - the river has OVERFLOWED the banks (+89 Level of 89SMA) and once it comes back inside the banks AND goes below the 13SMA, that is a signal to SELL. Same principle applies to the USD/CHF, USD/CAD &amp; EUR/USD if it overflows the banks (buy or sell - depending on which way). Take the trade in the direction BACK to wards the BLUE line (89SMA).

Hi Neal ,still long on gbpusd , + 100 pips....

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Wonderful! I'd go ahead and set a 15pip trailing stop on it (not how v1.01 will take it out) might as well maximise the profit, then it should put you back in for the retracement. Good Job! See.... our "Quest for 100" (pips/day) isn't a pipe dream. Especially if your trading multiple pairs. 20-30 pips on 4 pairs = 80-120 pips/day! Neal

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Unfortunately the EA has not performed to expectations over the last few days Neal so tweaking will have to be high on the Agenda.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Yes, theres a whole lot that will be different in v1.1 Will be more trades with smaller profits in order to lock in gains.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Gioviforex, Are all those trades at the bottom of the image from the Quest100 EA? Supprised that you would be getting such good results and some others might not. If they all are from Quest100 - looks like we may have a good thing going

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I think anybody using the the EA on 8 or more pairs over the last two days would have lost.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
My - lol Are you using 8 pairs. Perhaps see if there are patterns of pairs that have a lot of losses and eliminate them. They may not be suited for the settings the EA is using. If you find it is 1,2 or 3 pairs causing the turmoil, let us know so we can be careful and perhaps not trade them.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
NEALC99, Are the danger zones the dotted line on each side of the blue centerline? Are trades the sefest entered @ the outbanks? What about trades after crossing the danger zone? Thanks for you help. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Although in all fairness to your great brain Neal, this is due to the bad data out of the US which has thrown the EA out of sync. I can appreciate that it is very difficult trying to design an EA when expected/unexpected data comes out, but I guess the key is minimizing any losses that may occur. When you release 1.1 shortly, can you recommend settings and pairs ?? I haven't had much luck with USD/CAD, GBP/CHF, and EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Neal, yes i too would like clarification as to this as well. Can you explain in more detail the BEST TIME to BUY or SELL ? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
@ Neal Not 100% sure here, but it looks like the EA stops modifying the open trades, moving stop loss, once we are out of the BeginHour=8 and EndHour=15 trading hours. EA should continue to modify stop loss, if in profit of course, even after the trading hours? TimeFreedom

I have updated post #1 with an outline of the trading strategy for this method. You should now find your answer there.

I believe you are correct (didn't realize it was NOT doing that) - that's a bug. I will fix in v1.1. The HOUR restriction is for INITIATING a new trade. ADDENDUM: Hmmm.... no I just looked at the v1.01 code and it should be trailing every 15 minutes. I'll keep an eye out while testing, and try and look at a trade that could have been modified outside the trading hours. Just checked v1.1 and it is trailing properly (at least it will work once it's released).

--- 帖子 #178 ---
@ Neal Based on your strategy rules we should expect the EA v1.01 to place a buy trade @ 08:00 hours if the price continues to stay above -89 and above 13 SMA? TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I thas to gain some momentem first - the EA won't place the trade until their's some indication of a solid direction. It's just hovered within 5-10 pips for a few hours. Also if you are using the default settings, it's not even looking to open a trade till starting at 8:00am GMT

Released version of Quest100 v1.01 defaults are 08:00 &amp; 15:00 GMT Test version Quest100 v1.1 is running 08:00 - 18:00 (times may change before release)

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes all trades are from your ea

--- 帖子 #184 ---
in my opinion you are writing BS..... just to write something negative , just to critic job of someone else......why you don't put your ea ???????

Anther BS........

Here are results for date 26/2/2008 in pips USDCAD +95 EURUSD -48,+143 for total= +95 EURJPY -48,+1 total= -47 USDCHF -51.+81 total= +30 GBPUSD +83 AUDUSD still open but nicely in +zone All results were pure EA I mean trades were opened and closed by EA, each EA on each pair has its magic no, GMT offset is correct and other fields were unchanged Also I am running it on Alpari demo

--- 帖子 #187 ---
here the results from beginning.......consider that there are also the results from the first ea from Neal that was working not well........

--- 帖子 #188 ---
and this is the situation this morning..........as you can see i am up + 130 pips.......ok are trades coming from yesterday......there is also usdjpy short from yesterday...

If the ea perform in this way ,in just 10 days ,more or less, can double the account......

Hi Ahil , I am using ODL and i have GMT settins at 0 and time trading is from 8 to 18

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I am using Alpari and my GMT settings are -1, I will have to check what are settings on time trading (I am now at work), I didnt change it, it is as it was.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
result for yesterday and today morning -8$ but almost 300$ in floating gain... Run run run I will let it run whatever happen (except if my demo account breaks again :-/ ) and will check the result at the end of the week. Everyone should note that noone has suffer a loss with the new version untill now.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
You are using 1 full lots with a 5K default account and i doubt you will use the same settings on a live account (except if you are crazy )

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Why would the EA open this trade?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Any time the market has went "outside" the river (-89/+89 levels of 89SMA) it knows there is a reversal pending. It just took the trade. This is a normal trade with this system. You can review the OUTSIDE THE RIVER BANKS strategy in post #1 for more details.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
dasn't make any difference if you use mini account , gain is gain with mini or with regular.........

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I am pleased to see the different posts of the EA v1.01 doing so well for you. Even though I'm not happy with v1.01, I'm glad to see the market is being kind.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I give all my results in PIPS - that way lot size, and amounts are irrelivant. I understand many of you may take copies of your statement which it doesn't have the option of showing PIPS. Yes, it all boils down to a positive amount is a WIN and negative is a LOSS.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thanks nealc99. I thought that price has to first go throught the river line and the 13 Ma before it will open a trade. In a trade like this an automatic traling stop is part of the EA, is that correct?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Well it is certainly doing well for now (few days) why are you unhappy with v1.01?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
LOL - I just think that is the attitude of most EA coders. We want to get something out there so other people can use/test, so we release a version before we are satisfied. Probabbly on version 9.99 I still won't be happy - LOL

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Of course but 50 pips loss on a 5K account with a full lot is 500$ =&gt; 10% of the account in one shot. If you have 3-4 consecutive loosing position (that can happen as we all know) that would round 40% of the account lost. That is just too much of a drawdown to suffer. Edit : now it's -38$ but +340$ in floating gain

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I completely understand you there is always something to improve

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I'll probabbly turn MoneyManagement on at about Risk=5 (5%) and let it manage the lot size. At least it will take the "human" factor out of the equasion of wanting to do 1 full lot so they can make more. The MoneyManagement feature works really well, especially once you build up your balance some because it places increasing larger lot size as your balance &amp; risk factor can support (and of course scales back down if you suffer losses).

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi, This is to commend you on this project again. The beautiful thing I love (and just noticed) about this EA is the fact that it allows the profit to really run. A USDJPY trade was opened on my demo @ 107.75 yesterday and it was managing it. At a time, I saw a profit target and the SL was also moved. By the time I work up this morning (am in d GMT time zone), I noticed that the TP has been removed and the SL moved to a good level (106.71) locking in profit. This is a great work and I am sure the live version will be a lot better. But talking seriously, I can do with this for a ride. Pls note, I am using it only on USDJPY as per ur first post. Keep up the good work and thank you.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Oh, and by the way.... the EA doesn't RULE YOUR WORLD, they are your assistant to help you manage your account when your not around. For example: My goal is 100 pips/day. Right now the EA has 4 trades going (4 majors) and am up about 80 pips. There's nothing wrong with once I get to 100 pips, I TURN OFF THE EXPERTS (so it won't reopen trades) then close my 4 trades manually and achieve my daily goal. Now knowing me, about a 1/2 an hour before USA session, I'd probably turn the experts back on and let it trade the USA session. NEVER be afraid to take profit, just make sure you TURN THE EXPERT OFF so you don't risk it instantly reopening a position, and due to the timing it turning into a loss.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Now. Time for some fun...... CAUTION: Insane person at work! Call me crazy and tip over my rocking chair, but did you know that EMA/SMA's have "Oras". For those whom might not know, an ora is like an invisible energy barrier that surrounds your body. Some psychic's sense it, others have claimed to photograph it. Anyway, during the EA development process, I stumbled onto something I found quite interesting. I was looking for ways of keeping us out of bad trades and one of the things I was trying was putting levels around the 13SMA. Quite by accident I noticed a pattern. By putting a +/- level around the 13SMA (in this case I used 13 for a level - fib number you know - LOL) and scrolling through a month, I noticed that the "ora" acted as resistance for BUYS and support for SELLs. If they fell through their ora, most of the time the trend was broken or weakening and the market started moving the other way. NOW WHY DO I TELL YOU THIS CRAZY TALE? Well a trader is only as good as the sum of their knowledge, experience and TOOLS. This tool can assist you in when to be cautious and look to get OUT of a trade before it goes bad. In the image below the PURPLE DASHED line is the +13/-13 level around the 13SMA. If you look carefully you will notice in the middle you will see the candles dip down and ALMOST touch the -13 level (acting as support). If you look at the end of the chart, you see the candles climbing up getting ready to break -13. Since we are in a SELL this is an "early warning" that the trend may be weakening or coming close to the end of it's life. Once the candle crosses the 13SMA and penetrates the +13 level we can use this as a SIGNAL to exit the trade. Just for fun, put +13/-13 levels around your 13SMA and scroll back through the days. You will see that sometimes it doesn't hold but a lot of times it DOES. Perhaps a +/-21 level might be better - probably depends on the pair. Well have fun, and as a reminder: SELL: -13 level = EARLY WARNING ..... +13 level = GET OUT! BUY: +13 level = EARLY WARNING ..... -13 level = GET OUT! And for those who do not know how to set levels, just click on the property box of the 13SMA and put them in on the LEVELS tab. (not example has 89's for levels - you would put 13 or 21)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Neal you are a genius !!!! Anyway i believe you posted a wrong picture for settings.( 89 and -89 instead of +13 and -13)

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Sorry for my ignorance, but I am really new with Experts. So if you set the MM=True the fixed Stoploss and T/P will be ignored in the settings? Also, was the Deleting of the T/P done on purpose to let trades run at a certain point? I noticed that it happens on E/U and G/U quite a bit. I still have not seen the trailing stop kick in. Maybe I will re attach the expert to the charts and start from scratch. Thanks

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yes, I mentioned it at the end of the previous post (it was just a pic I already had).

--- 帖子 #213 ---
MM has to do with the lot size it places. Most people have a mini account or want to use a very small lot size. Set LOTS=0.1 (instead if 1). What it will do is adjust your lot size it uses for placing the trade according to your account balance &amp; Risk= setting. Let's say you have $10,000 in your account and Risk=10 (10%). When it starts trading it will be placing 1 lot orders. As your balance grows it will place 1.1, 1.2, 1.6, 2, 3,5.5, .... etc. So the EA place more lots on the same trade because your balance is larger and can support the risk if the trade fails. Also if a trade wins, your winnings is multiplied by that lot size factor.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
same story if you use mini acc. and have a loss of 50$ ....

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Ok....basic MM. Just did not understand how the EA worked. I appreciate your help!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Working diligently on finishing up EA v1.1 for release before end of 23:59 GMT tonight. Should be ready. Have Dr. appointment so will be gone a while.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
That was not my point My point was to say that if you use mini lot .1 on a 5K account, 4 loss of 50 pips in a row will round only 4% drawdown and not 40%.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Ok now is clear your point

--- 帖子 #219 ---
NealC99, Just when I learned how to apply +&amp;- around the SMA 89 here you go &amp; see a need for +&amp;- around the the SMA 13. Just kidding, but seriously you have made a great discovery ref the the 13 SMA. Thanks. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Sorry guys for the delay in releasing v1.1 Took a nap and slept longer than I had planned. Then found 1 or 2 things I want to get fixed before releasing Will be released as soon as I get them done.

EA v1.1 will be released TODAY (GMT) (come rain or come shine). I basically have the final version done and just want to let it run on the London session to make sure it's acting alright. Am adding 3 pairs for testing - AUD/USD, EUR/CHF &amp; EUR/JPY (because my broker only charges 3 pips so might as well test them out). INCOMPATIBLE PAIR: EUR/GBP

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I agree - today was not a good day for the EA. As for the loss (-149 pips) - things are a lot different in v1.1. It has tighter SL's and takes profit in small chunks. So hopefully a single day's loss will be much smaller.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
well looking forward to test it, since it is demo acc I have no problem with losing money has anyone done backtesting with 90% accuracy, I have done only backtesting with unknown accuracy and it isnt something, but backtests are sometimes very unreliable

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes I agree on the backtesting. I have found that results with backtesting this EA are only about 70% reliable (even with 90% data quality). I think the best thing I've found so far is 3 months at a time. I'm suspecting that if we set our settings with the results of the past 3 months optimized, that may be our best chance for the current month. Will experiment around with that maybe sometime next week. I still think the best way will be to build in optimization where it determines the best settings say over the past 7 days results. This way the future week can perhaps more accurately be forecast based on the previous 7 days.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Agree on that because market changes and optimization from time to time would be necesarry thing to maximize gains and prevent losses - that would be called AI (artificial intelligence) Only thing it becomes more complicated at that stage with optimization (it is a another system within a system)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Well, will be interesting to see how the EA handles it - think it may do ok since it's calm now and not in any trades. Only problem is it will get in late and then by the time it senses a signal (since it's 15m based) it'll take the signal but things will be retracing by then - lol May not be a good EA for news events (of course none of them are really). Thinking of testing 5m version of EA next week to see how it does.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I have a short order on eurchf up +70 but the EA has yet to update the SL... What's wrong ???

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Most likley a bug with 1.01 - go ahead and put a manual s/l in if you wish, or a trailing stop through Metatrader.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi guys, positions update......if i close now all open positions i am up 100% on account in less of 10 days......

--- 帖子 #236 ---
By the way..... watch for another posting by that INSANE person about "auras" and the market. He's about to bust his buttons with excitement. More on that later..... Neal p.s. - thanks to the person who finally told this INSANE person I had spelled "auras" wrong (had it oras).

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Will keep it in the back of my mind.....

what was your Money management or risk on each trade and did you close most of the position manualy if thats the case maybe there should be some other rxit strategy for EA

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind this may not behave as demonstrated in backtesting.... We are moving from the backtesting phase to forward testing. Sometimes things act different than planned. BACKTESTING This EA for some reason does not backtest well. I have see it do odd things (like not take trades that met the exact conditions necessary SETTINGS NOTE: EA - not for use on GOLD or GBP/JPY till v1.2 (internal settings are different) MagicNumber = 304323 MUST BE UNIQUE to this EA (i.e. not the same number as any other EA's you might have running) == Start Time == BeginHour =8 (GMT) (defaults determined through 6 month backtesting) EndHour =20 (GMT) GMTOffset =2 (your broker's difference from GMT) == Main Settings == Sensitivity =18 DO NOT ENTER TRADES above &amp; below this number from the 89SMA (buffer zone - false signals) Sensitivity12H =11 Distance ABOVE 13SMA to open BUY or close a SELL Sensitivity12L =8 Distance BELOW 13SMA to open a SELL or close a BUY TakeProfit =35 Take Profit (trailing) Moves UP by setting for a BUY but not down (opposite for a SELL) StopLoss =35 Stop loss (trailing) Moves UP by setting for a BUY but not down (opposite for a SELL) StopDistance =30 Does not place a BUY/SELL if it is this distance INSIDE the banks of the river (+89/-89 levels of 89SMA) CloseOrdersDaily =false Close all trades at 00:00 each day (not recommended or tested) == Money Management == Lots =1 Lot size for each trade (i.e. 1.0, .01, .1) MoneyManagement =false Use money management routines Risk =10 Percent of account balance to risk on a trade EA is located on post #1 NOTE: Sometime the EA will get into a trade "before" the trend starts to change. I know several times it may have went -10 -25 pips then recovered to end up in a profit. Yes, there are times it will end up stopping out, but just because it goes down, more times than not it will recover. DO NOT BE AFRAID to take out a trade when it looks like the trend is about to change. My goal is 100 pips/day and if I get to that level, turn the EA *OFF*, exit the trades, then start it back up after midnight GMT to harvest another day's pips. The EA is a "tool" to help you get into trades when your not monitoring the market and to take trades out if you're not around. By all means if you've reached your goal for the day or see indication the trend is changing - BY ALL MEANS CLOSE OUT THE TRADES!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Alright Neil lets put this new EA to the test as all of us are starting to fall asleep waiting for this thing...LOL

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Love everything you are doing here Neal, however, it is spelled 'aura'

--- 帖子 #243 ---
LOL - ok I will correct it (except for the origional post which I can't edit any longer)

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yep I agree Neal, great work ! I'm confident that you will come up with a very good EA as you are just getting better and better. Quest 1.4 and 1.5 were OK but just needed more work. I personally think small profits of 10-15 points is the way to go with a 30 point Stop Loss. If the EA is good enough then the winners will outstrip the losers.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
What pairs are everyone testing on?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
MagicNumber = 304323 MUST BE UNIQUE to this EA (i.e. not the same number as any other EA's you might have running) Neal sorry for question ,but do i have to change to attach on each pair like your old ea ? thanks ?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I'm testing on 4 majors and USD/CAD, AUD/USD, EUR/CHF &amp; EURJPY

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Yes, think of th MagicNumber as a street address. Each EA's street address must be different so it know what trades belong to it. If you have everyone living at the same address the EA will have bad results (like trailing stops on for EUR/USD based on GBP/USD figures and they will be fighting each other).

--- 帖子 #249 ---
In case you didn't see the origional post explaining all of this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=209 Insane Person Alert!!!! SMA/EMA's have Aura's!

Very important. Just like I told you, if you are doing good and you see the market turning, TAKE THE TRADE OUT!. At one point today I was up +140 pips and knew the market was turning. I could have CLOSED all my transactions and would have made +110 pips MEETING MY DAILY GOAL. It's the chemistry of the "mechanical" EA and the ability of the human trader that will make you money in the long run.

I have uploaded an updated version 1.2 of the Winding River template which now includes the "aura" (so maybe you'll take advantage of trades related to it - or if nothing else will be warned when the trend is about to change). quest100v_1.2.tpl (Winding River) quest100v_1.2gj.tpl (Winding River for GBP/JPY) quest100v_1.2gold.tpl (Winding River for Gold) Templates located on post #1

@ Neal I am a little confused with the 89 SMA levels (RedOrange, dash-dot lines). You mentioned a few post back -18, +18, and now I see -21, +21 on the new templates v1.2? Please advise. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #256 ---
It is now +/- 21 (18 was old and I couldn't edit the post to change it to 21) The new template 1.2 on post #1 already has everything set up for you if you want to download it.

Neal, My friends ea's are up 68% in profits using the auto optimization versus his ea's not using the auto optimization. I believe your quest ea would be one of the ultimate ea's if you had this in yours. Just my thoughts. Jeff

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Neal, Why not have a global closure feature if all trades are open 100 pips close them out? Jeff

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Neal Just a little clarification if you don't mind.....Do we use the v1.1 EA with the 1.2 template ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I'm a bit confused by the MM system in the EA here - should you be using the Lots and Risk settings together? Or does the EA auto calculate what Lot size to be using if you have MoneyManagement=true and Risk set? Thanks! - Kevin

--- 帖子 #263 ---
No currently on GBP/JPY and GOLD. If you put the regular 1.1 template on GJ or GOLD you will see why. The levels are radically different for those two. It will not only require slight differences in the code, but all the settings will be different. Perhaps in v1.3 I'll tackle GJ at least (not v1.2).

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Yes. Probably I should mention it in the post #1 or use a different versioning technique. The template version and the EA version are not related in any way. There will always only be 1 version of each in post #1 and it will just be the most recent one that we are using.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Yes, that's a little confusing isn't it. I will move Lots= up under a different category. Lots= is used regardless if you have MoneyManagement enabled or not so you can control how many lots it uses for each trade. If MoneyManagement is TRUE, it doesn't even look at the Lots= setting. It will do it's calculation and the minimum will be 0.1 if your account balance is too low. (Maximum will be 99).

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Excellent! And the Risk % is on a per trade basis, or in terms of how many trades the EA will allow you to have open full stop? I'm reading it as per trade, but wondering if there's some way to limit how many trades in total the EA could have you in.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I know you're a total rookie if you actually entertain the idea of 500 pips a week. At that rate you could eclipse Bill Gates and Warren Buffet in wealth within a year. I suggest you take a reality pill.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Risk= and the balance of your account determine the lot size calculation - so it doesn't matter if you have 10 EA's running it always looks at your account balance * Risk= (which is a percentage) to determine lot size. Each EA (Quest EA at least) should only allow 1 trade open per MagicNumber.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Got to have a goal (whether or not it can be reached) Is 20-30 pips per day for a pair unrealistic? Well 20 pips per day by trading 5 different pairs = 100 pips per day. I agree that 100 per day on a single pair or trade is unrealistic on an ongoing basis.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Just put 1.1 on MT4 but it wont trade with uninit5 reason... Also, the EA says that it wont work on live account but it's on demo ATM... Any idea ? Have you changed the logic because the previous version was was trading allmost as soon as i put it on my charts ?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
It is probably fine. Uninit5 states that you changed the parameters (perhaps the magicnumber after it had a smiley face) and it was just restarting the EA: http://docs.mql4.com/constants/uninit No, it normally will not start a trade immediately now. I've only had 2 trades so far today since 8:00 GMT and none are currently open. The "demo" statement always appears when the EA first starts in the journal. You would also get an ALERT box if you tried to put it on a live account.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Thanks a lot, so i'll let it run from now then

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I think the new version will work well in ranging markets. with the new "auras" around the MAs. But the trends are strong this week. The EA opened up a short on U/CHF and was 20 pips up then stopped and reversed but was stopped out and washed the 20 pip gain. If the short had kept going I think it would have hit T/P......oh well. Not gonna win them all. Chris

--- 帖子 #274 ---
That would be a good thing!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
@ Neal Not sure why the EA didn't open the short on the highlighted candle on the chart. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I don't think you are using the new template. The entries I think are based on when it hits the new levels of the 13. That is why my U/CHF was a stop and reverse, but it kept going and washed my 20 pip gain

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Is 20p a day per pair reasonable? I would say not really.... Only because it just isn't done. Anywhere. That would be 5,200per year, every year, per pair. Trading 5 pairs, 26,000p per year??? Reasonable?? Well, if so, why isn't it being done by reasonable traders? Even pros don't even get CLOSE to that!! Amongst us traders that make a living on this, we can live quiet well on 150p a week. (not a DAY!).... And that for for ALL of our trades, not just one pair. Now THIS apprears to be quite reasonable. (5 pairs, net +30p per week per pair...) Our forward testing will give us an indication of what we can expect, and so far, we're not there yet... much less 20p per day per pair, every day. Look, we don't need 26,000p per year. We don't need to turn $1k into a million $ in a year. If this system can generate 100+p per week, which it has a decent chance of doing, but not without some work and trade management on our part, then you have a GREAT system... We don't need to sensationalize it with outrageous claims.. it appears to be good enough on it's own.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I'm not ignoring everyone, just heavy into concentrating on someting. Will be with you a little later....

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Good on you Neal for developing this system. I have a feeling that you will be improving on it as much as possible over the coming weeks. I would still like to know the optimal pair(s) for trading your EA ? Clearly there are certain pairs that have a higher success rate than others, and it would be nice to ascertain just exactly what those pairs are. Neal, is it possible that from now on you can upload updated versions of your EA so as we can trade "live" if we want to ? Some of us like the idea of risking a few dollars here and there. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
you could always visit a casino if you want to risk a few bucks just a joke don't take it too hard

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Well thats not a bad idea there Ahil but I think the odds may be greater using Neil's Expert Advisors ! Maybe not yet but not too far away...hopefully...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Much superior version of EA in process (v1.2). Been concentrating on it because I'm just not satisfied with how v1.1 is behaving (or performing). I found that I looking so close at the "aura" on the 13SMA that I completely missed the aura on the 89SMA. 1) they are not in harmony currently, 2) using the 89SMA aura completely eliminates the need for the 13SMA and gives you much bigger/safer entires/exits. With the 89SMA the trades are longer than the 13SMA - many are overnight. So you can see the 89SMA aura I've put up an image. I won't go into explaining much detail at this point, but you can probably figure it out by closely studying it. I have put up Quest100v_1.3proto template up so you can play around with it and use it to glance back in history. In the image below - Trade 1 yielded 47 pips... Trade 2 yielded 52 pips... Trade 3 (NFP retracement) yielded 53 pips. There are other trades in this image but those were the safe ones. NOW by adding the 12SMA aura principle on the first trade we could have went ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM yielding 153 pips.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I am thinking about doing a "aura" training because I think this can be SO valuable in manual trading, especially as an exit strategy. Aura's are based on Fibs and we all know how powerful Fibs are. If you are interested in attending an audio/visual presentation on auras, please private message me (that way I'll have your forum user name) and I'll reply with a date/time/place. It may be Sunday or a day next week. This will be a Skypecast (or another audio conference room) along with the ability to text chat and for me to push content to the participants (charts, webpages, etc). When you message me, let me know what time of day would be good for you - to keep it simple, make it GMT timezone if you are outside the USA (or EDT, CDT, MDT,PDT if your are in the USA and don't want to figure out the GMT - lol). Also give me your Skype user name - or tell me if you do not have Skype. (speakers/headphones would be required to hear... microphone required if you wish to ask questions)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
hey i really like wat u are doing here, just wondering if you ever thought of the crossing of the 13 and the 89 would be a good exit signal. just a thought =)

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Sounds good Neal, and yes v1.1 doesn't seem to be up to scratch and is performing rather poorly. My experience with EA's is that you need to have a good Stop Loss in of around the 35-50 point mark and make the Take profit around the 10 - 20 point mark. Now this may not sound great but believe me if you are winning 95% of your trades then a small loss here and there will not offset the wins that you are having. Now don't get me wrong here, winning 50-80 points is great but it's not always that easy to do this consistently. Better to take a smaller profit and lock it in. If an EA is good enough it can always execute another trade for the same pair(s) anyway. My experience working for a FX Company (turning over 5 billion per annum) and watching the fundamentals day in and day out is that you must have a Stop Loss on. EA's that rely on the market coming back around again are not guaranteed as the draw downs can be massive. By the way, and for those of you who are interested, Online Brokers love people who use Expert Advisors as they use their platforms and hence spend money. It's ABOUT money in THEIR bank accounts. The reality is is that 95% of people who use EA's probably lose their money. The small percentage of people who do use winning EA's are few and far between. The ones that are using winning EA's are invariably not spending big money anyway so Brokers are not overly concerned. People like Neal here will eventually develop a good EA but again Brokers are not overly concerned about this as the money they make from the payments that come in is what makes them happy. Food for thought.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
13/89 crossing is a good "early warning" to start paying attention to a possible trend change. There's a lot of "sluggishness" around the 89 while the market decides on it's next direction (in a lot of cases). I have found that it is safest to trade from the "outer fringes" and gravitate BACK to the 89 in trades. Quite often you get the "sling shot" effect where it will just go right through the 89 like a hot knife in butter. That's the nice trades to be in and stay in. ADDENDUM: Misread your post (must be tired - LOL) Yes it is a good exit signal.

For you that can't make it to a LIVE training (one tonight), here is the avBook completely outlining the strategy (both the 89SMA and 13SMA strategies) and showing examples of how to trade it during market news events. So grab a cup of coffee and enjoy (about 30 minutes long). Please feel free to share the link to the presentation to other traders you might feel this strategy could be of value. If nothing else it's another TOOL to use for entry/exit warnings. http://allonq.com/pr/4128&amp;s=1 Thanks! Neal p.s. Link can also be found in post #1 (for future reference).

NealC99, As I have stated, I'm not a big fan of EA's, but if one will work that is great. This method is a great method for manual trading in that it has those built in filters with the +&amp;- lines. I have taken 5 trades &amp; so far all are winners. Your lastest training materials can only make it better. As for the EA, I wish you the best with its ongoing development, but the warning from one trader is the reason I stay clear. Thanks again for sharing this great method. AceTrader

Hey people! if you aren't seriously taking a look at this system - you BETTER START! I just made +40 pips on my LIVE account IN 10 MINUTES on a signal produce by this method. Watch the training, it's well worth your time. It can supplement any current strategy your using with more indication of when to enter/exit to add to the signals you already use. Training URL is on Post #1 p.s. - no the current EA v1.1 didn't pick up on it because it's not programed for the 89SMA strategy at this point. v1.2 will be.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Regular template quest100v_1.3.tpl is now available. Please replace the v1.2 you may have.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Well for the few who doubted you could make 100 pips in a day - ON A LIVE ACCOUNT IN LIVE TRADING..... Get the template Quest100v_1.3.tpl - and watch the presentation. I made +77 pips today following the signals on a LIVE!!!! account - not just a demo. Practice a few weeks on a demo taking the trades, then after you are comfortable and making consistent good trades, GO OUT AND GET A SMALL LIVE ACCOUNT and practice on very small lots (like a micro account at 0.1 or something). If you need a good broker where you can get in for very little (i.e. $100 to be safe) there is the broker I use on the next to the last page of the presentation. (Press the "H" button on the navigation icon and it will take you to the table of contents, then you can go right to the page). Attached are my 3 trades: EURUSD +40 USDCHF +7 (aborted - got scared - lol) USDCAD +30 Oh did I mention (no, guess I did not) - my LIVE account balance is up over 15% from since Feb 26th (that's 6 CALENDAR days for those of you who read the thread in a month from now).

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Neal, Enjoyed the presentation last night and I recommend that other folks take a look at what Neal has put online. I think the thread started with the objective to make 100 pips a day from an EA. It's looking more probable that this can be achieved with this method. Well done thus far. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi Neal, I work a lot of hours so I did not get a chance to see your presentation but I plan on doing that very soon. I was wondering when you do think version 1.2 will be released? Jeff

--- 帖子 #301 ---
well just to update EA results EA v1.1 It is working on 8 pairs but yesterday (3/3/08) it only traded USDCAD -25 pips USDCHF -12 pips today (4/3/08) it opened and closed 1 trade AUDUSD -20 pips btw. Neal on your 3 examples from your live acc you didnt wait for a candle to go below 13 MA for a sell (ok 13 MA was somewhere near 89 MA but then would that be a legitimate signal?? )

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Weird...

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I just had a quick look at your video seminar and I'm quite impressed Neal. the amount of work you have put into this is just amazing. The "real" challenge is making it work successfully and consistently with an EA.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi,, this is my first post in FF but I've been following this thread closely from the first post. I would like to thank Neal for introducing this amazing system. I took 3 short trades of EUR/USD, EUR/JPY and USD/CHF on my LIVE account for a total of +81 pips. That was the first time I felt so confident to take the trade. Thanks again. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Yes, shouldn't have done that. Will monitor the star/stop time see if I find any.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
See people, another manual trader using the system on a LIVE acount and +81 pips in a day (guess it was a day). Rx8 - if you haven't watched the presentation on Post #1, WATCH IT! It will show you had to trade both the 89 and 12 auras in conjunction with each other in many trades. LOL and send a donation now that you've profited for the system (just kidding).

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Yes, Vincent001 I agree. Most times in the EA isn't a problem, it's when it goes outside the banks that I'm having an issue (goes outside and bounces back and forth through the river bank - rapid fires trades, opening/stopping out).

Oh you ask how do I make all these nice looking screenshots? There's a WONDERFUL little tool out there called Jing by Techsmith which is absolutley FREE.

At 9:15 ET the EA opened a trade on EUR/CHF at 1.5755. Although the price was near the green "buy" line it opened a sell. (which at the moment is -5pips.) The chart has the latest template. and looks like price is ready to turn. Any idea why it opened the sell order? Thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #314 ---
v1.1 doesn't trade the green/red buy/sell lines - it only trades the 12SMA trades. I have found that many times a trade will go negative then turn back positive with v1.1.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Am keeping an eye on AUD/USD &amp; EUR/JPY which are coming up on a signal.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
It's a good system for sure Neil. Do you have any other rules pertaining to entering around the 89 levels ? Sometimes it's hard to identify where a good entry point is around those Brown lines ?? I guess the rule of thumb is that if you enter around the 89 lines, eventually it will track back towards the centre of the river.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
(BUY) Once it goes above the brown line and above opens above the 13SMA is the safest.... sometimes the 13SMA will be to far away and you have to use your judgement. (opisite for SELL). No determination on entering arround the 89SMA (blue line) as of yet.... still studying - but not a safe place - LOL

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Whoa... this thread is rapidly growing. Neal, You've put a tremendous effort. Hardly can wait that v1.2. I'd like to trade the plan manually, but since I work full time, I find it difficult with M15. So, I think I'd give this EA a shot. Started with 1.1 Your profit goal is interesting and I won't say that's impossible, though I'd be very happy with far smaller than that. As one said before me. Consistency is far more important. Now, watching the thread closely.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I just found this thread today and have found it a very interesting read. Looking forward to trying out the EA on a demo when I get home tonight. One question, does the EA leave trades open over the weekend or does it close out any open trades when the market closes on Friday?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
The EA only closes on a signal. So if you have a trade open on Friday and there's no signal to close, it will remain open and continue to trade Sunday when the market opens back up. (you can close them out manually on Friday if you wish). All you new people - be sure to watch the Aura Training - URL is in Post #1 It's about 30 minutes long but will be well worth your time in understanding exactly the system works.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Looks like we are getting a buy signal on A/U using the new 89SMA aura, template v1.3, but with one exception, we are past our trading hour window. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Trading hours apply to the EA since it's unattended. I do agree though that I would be cautious getting this late in the market session. There will not be as much activity and the river could turn even though the market don't move much (you know how SMA's gravitate to what the market is doing). Of course since it's AUD/USD and Sydney market is one of the first to open you will probabbly be fine... noticed it's up to 0.9259 and moving up. I am currently in a USD/CAD SELL that I feel comfortable with (got into a little while ago when price was at 0.9950 (17:24 GMT) when it ALMOST touched the signal, then started going back down.... then went back up and pierced through the SELL signal.

You ask (I know cause my ears are burning), what pairs are you monitoring to see if there are eligible trades? EUR/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD, GPB/USD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, EUR/CHF, EUR/JPY I also hear you asking "Why don't you start a LIVE trading room?" well I may in a few weeks. It will eventually be subscription only but free for a period of time.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Guess this is what happens when you are monitoring too many pairs. How could I have MISSED this bueaty... and it's still going....

--- 帖子 #326 ---
its still going but as per rules you would have exited at the exit line for buy right ??? do u think it would be a good idea to trade 2 or more lots and exit 1 lot ad the exit line, carry on the other lots and exit as it goes on .. ?? Thanks, Goodbadmas P.S. I did take few trades using this method and banked about 45 pips today !

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Great Job! on the 45 pips... The trade would have been entered on the 89SMA BUY signal, but since it was going good when it got up to the exit point we have the option of continuing in the trade by shifting over to the 13SMA rules then exiting based on them. If you can sustain 2 lots (depends on the size of your account) - yes it's always good to do 2 lots on a GOOD trade and exit 1 and let the other trailing stop out.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thanks .... now that makes sense to me .. will try that on next time i see it moving good in our direction ... Thanks again for the great system Goodbadmas

Missed the AUDUSD trade while posting. TimeFreedom

Yep - I'm proud of all of you that are catching the signals!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
cant wait for the new EA to come ... how is it coming along ? i tried the last one and got 3 losing trades with it ... dont know why on one of the setup usdchf this morning was the buy and it moved a little up and for some reason EA opeaned up short on it ... lolz ... so will wait for new one to see how it does .. Thanks, Goodbadmas

--- 帖子 #332 ---
EA didnt perform well on 4/3/2008 6 losses all together

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Neal, you have made an splendid effort with this trading system but it would be great to see an EA for it.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Weird. The trade was executed at 21:15. I have "Start time" setting at default. My broker time has +2 GMT offset. And was that supposed to be BUY there?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Anybody trade this pair with the EA? Do you have SELL postion now (by the time this message was posted)?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Nice method no doubt &amp; for me this week in the manual mode +125 as of now. I would be great if the EA can be refined to a point that it filters the questionable trade, but for now trading in the manual mode works great for me. Have traded the E/$, E/Y &amp; $/CAD with on loser &amp; on closed @ break even. Total of 15 trades so far. The loser would have eventually be a winner, but it was near close on Friday &amp; I did not desrie to hold it over the weekend. Neal, thanks for sharing &amp; I wish you the best with the refinement of the EA. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Agree with you, Acetrader. This is one of the best system I found so far. I took 6 manual trades for a total of +109 pips in my live acc. in 2 days. Great job, Neal.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I had the same issue (look in my previous post) so it's probably a bug in the Ea. I guess, Nealc will try to fix it

Trading for March 4, 2008 with Quest100_v1.1 EA: 2604057 2008.03.04 02:02 buy audusd @ 0.9390 to 0.9375 -15 pips 2610734 2008.03.04 12:45 sell audusd @ 0.9300 to 0.9319 -19 pips 2611574 2008.03.04 13:30 sell eurchf @ 1.5758 to 1.5779 -20 pips 2617308 2008.03.04 19:00 buy usdcad @ 0.9957 to 0.9941 -16 pips Today's total: -70 pips All losers - not a good day for the EA.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
v1.1 EA doesn't trade the 89SMA - that's why it looks odd. It is trading the 13SMA alone.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I'm so happy to see others profiting from this system. Especially posts of trades in LIVE accounts that have averaged +50 pips/day. Each time I see something like that it makes me more confident that we CAN reach our goal of +100 pips/day with some experience trading the system under our belts. I know in my case, it's the FEAR factor still hanging around from all the other systems we all have tried and suffered losses with. Thanks for the support and keep up the good work! Also, even with the v1.2 EA (not sure on the time schedule - am shooting for next week sometime) I personally will let it OPEN trades, but I will still monitor them and close them manually if I feel the market is turning. The EA is high on the list because I want it to help monitor trade ENTRY's so I don't miss any

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Too bad it didn't go close enough to the +89SMA level for us to pick up on the trade. It would have been a nice one. The Quest100_v1.1 EA did open an order for it. IT DID on the EUR/JPY and am in that one at +21 at the moment - should end up yielding 30-40 pips when it's done. We may be able to carry the trade further if switching over to the 13SMA looks promising.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
greattttttttt goodbadmas

--- 帖子 #344 ---
BUY EUR/JPY on my machine and of course hit the SL few bars after the entry. I see it's because the EA doesn't trade 89SMA as you mentioned previously. 3 trades in last 20 hours with v1.1 : USD/CAD -25 NZD/USD -7 EUR/JPY -19 Hope we can see it fixed soon.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Keep a close eye on EUR/JPY - once it gives a solid reverse (like going back down through the +89 level - brown line at top) it would be a good time to get in.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi Neal, there is a river overflow in eur/jpy. Time to short? This is a classic example of ur river overflowing. Pls advice

--- 帖子 #347 ---
It needs to show a good sign of reversing first - I'd say when it goes below 158.30 or comes back inside the banks of the river.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
All of you better be scanning the charts - signals getting ready to pop up all over the place. EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, GBB/USD, AUD/USD - chance for several good trades. MONITOR - not necesiarly saying go in right now - let the trend start reversing (some are).

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Thanks for the heads up neal. Several of the major pairs are all on the overflowing river. Kindly keep us all informed as we all monitor together.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
hi neal, i was just reading through the thread trying to do some catching up. the system looks wonderful and promising although backtesting the EA did not give me good results. but one important question i have is that at what level should my stop loss be when i place a trade. thank you. once again welldone and good job.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I would say 30-40 pips is a reasonable stop loss. The EA doens't backtest well. I noticed that while developing. It misses obvious trades sometimes. v1.2 will be more refined.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Neal, it is nice to have everything available in the first post, but would it be possible that you keep also the old versions there like the 1.01 for instance or do you think there will be too many after some time. It could be interesting to be able to compare the different versions, what do you think?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I'm a little confused, can you tell me why the EA would take this as a buy signal for AUDUSD?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
EA v1.1 bases it's buys on: EMA12+Sensitivity12H &lt; EMA89-Sensitivity &amp;&amp; High[1] &lt;= EMA12-Sensitivity12L SMA13 plus the +21 level is less than SMA89 minus the Sensitivity setting *** AND *** the previous candle's HIGH is less than SMA13 - Sensitivity12L setting Aren't you glad you asked - LOL - I get a headache just looking at it.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
12SMA trade..... Interesting that the "exit" for our 12SMA trade may be a good point to get in a little early on our 89SMA SELL on the EUR/JPY. Let's see how it plays out...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Some call it "consolidation", I call it "constipation" The market has to strain sometimes to get going again - LOL You people on DEMO accounts should be making a small fortune today with all the signals we have.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Could you post the charts when you have time with the signals so I can study them and make sure I'm on the right track?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
TEXTBOOK example of when to swtch from your 89SMA strategy over to your 13SMA strategy for your EXIT. We started on an 89SMA BUY signal to get into the trade. When we were at the 89SMA EXIT signal we "evaluate" how the 12SMA strategy is doing. In this case all conditions were GO to switch over to the 12SMA strategy, so we STAY IN THE TRADE and look for our 12SMA EXIT signal. As you can see this one was a beauty and would have yielded around 135 pips! Right before exiting an 89SMA trade, look to see if you would be still in a 12SMA trade. Maximize your profit and still keep your risk minimized.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Great Job - just a different way of doing it (multiple lots to achieve the 100 pips per day).

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Today may not be a good day to trade. Everyone is saving their pips for NFP tomarrow. I did notice a coupple of trades but they took like 6hrs to complete and you only would have made 20pips. Use your own judgement.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Even though the 89SMA strategy may not have enough momentum today, it does look like their may be some good trades out there using the 13SMA. I see the EA v1.1 has opened up a GBP/USD and is up +44 pips. To review the 13SMA strategy click HERE: http://allonq.com/pr/4128&amp;s=14 (You can get back to the table of contents by clicking the "H" on the navigation icon at the top of the presentation)

nealc99, I love your system and have been demoing it on the 15 min charts as you suggest with success. I am wondering if you have suggested SMA lengths and levels for a 5 min chart, as I am used to using that TF, number of trades, and I also prefer the smaller stop loss necessary. any help very much appreciated. Once again thanks so much for sharing you terrific system and the audio video slides presented as well. traderdp

Neal. I STILL FIND IT HARD DETERMINING when to get into a trade. If I take a risk and enter a position at the Brown line the markets sometimes still goes down below by over 100 points (extreme case). Then I have to worry about how long it stays down and whether not the gain it makes is worth it at all. IS there no rule of thumb regarding this ?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
hi seamonkey, i did exactly like what u are mentioned. still could not load. it was appeared at custom indicators. when i click on it, no reaction on the Quest 100.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
It can be tricky sometimes. I have added 2 slides to the avBook addressing the issue of "undercurrents" in the river, the danger of using the BROWN LINE as a early entry signal and an example of how a VALID signal can result in a negative balance exit (happens rarely). Review this page and then do NEXT ( &gt; ) to see the 2nd entry added. (narrated slides). http://allonq.com/pr/4128&amp;s=24 Everybody ready for NonFarm Employment Change? Don't forget - the system (usually) does NOT give a signal for the initial surge, but we trade the "retracement" going in the opposite direction after the market has peaked out.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Neal, if u see something can u post it here pls ? Since you are the expert of this system ? Thanks Goodbadmas

I will be in this room for about the next 2 hours - testing out LIVE broadcasting of charts and voice. Feel free to join me: http://vyew.com/room#/850804/TradingRoom NOTE: once your screen fully loads you might want to do an F11 (Internet explorer) to go FULL SCREEN (then you can F11 to toggle it back to regular browser when you leave). You'll be able to see more of the chart that way. Also (unfortunately) you have the ability to draw on the screen - please don't could be distracting to others. Voice is also available.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hope those of you who were able to join me in the LIVE trading session found it usefully. Will try to hold more LIVE sessions in the future.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Here is one of the trades we took this morning in the LIVE trading session. ENTERED once the large upward spikes settled down due to NonFarm Employment Change, then continued in a downward trend till it "almost" (within 1-2 pips) touched the exit line. A little later it produced a clean exit by piercing the exit line. Trade would have yielded +34 pips (I got a little trigger happy and set a tight 15pip stop loss which took us out a little early). Hey, I'm still learning too - LOL Be sure and MONITOR USD/JPY and EUR/JPY - they are positioning themselves for SELL signals over the next hour or two.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
USD/CAD setting up for a good sell signal - keep an eye out for it.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I was at work and could only stay a little bit, but from what I saw I liked it. Will be looking forward to others, hopefully I'll be off work when you have them. I think I can learn a lot from watching you explain the trades live. Thanks again for all your hard work

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thanks Neal, yes it's good to know about the risks involved and it is primarily about determining when to enter once the trade has passed over the Brown line. On most occasions it doesn't seem to go on more than 40-50 points past/through the brown line. It's a pity there isn't an indicator as to when we can possibly enter here. Of course one can't determine the outcome of how exactly the fundamentals will affect the market.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hello Neal, I just finished your avBook and wish to thank you for this great method. My next obvious question is - what are the settings for GBPJPY? I am sorry if you have mentioned those between pages 3 and 24 because I have not yet read them... my impatience led me to write this post asking for it. Meanwhile, I will try to find out what those settings are... if you can then please post the settings as a reply to my post . Thanks, -A.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Still determining the setting for GBP/JPY for the latest template (v1.3). It is a little more unruley than most of the less volitile pairs.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
thanks a lot !

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I tell you people - this system has some great "safe" trades. Look at this one from this morning +55 pips!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Here's another one (I missed it ) another +44 pips. Also NOTE if the market is going you YOUR FAVOR, you can stay in and make some additional pips!

--- 帖子 #384 ---
man, i missed all these trades !! oh well catch it nex time ! Goodbadmas

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Why did you miss this trade?Did the EA not give signal?Yes ,my computer NOT yet! May be the EA need to be consummated.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Several good trades setting up to monitor. Keep an eye on GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, EUR/JPY

--- 帖子 #387 ---
hello neal, are my suppose to wait for the candlestick that pierce the signal line or 13MA to close b4 i enter the trade or i can just enter once the candle stick pierces thru the signal line or 13MA.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Safest to wait till it pierces both - sometimes when the 13SMA is ABOVE the signal line it will go back up then return down. Gives a little safety if it crosses both.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Neal, I want to thank you for hard work on this. I am just wondering how the next version of the ea is going? Thank You, jeff

--- 帖子 #390 ---
It has been delayed temporarily. I am working on an "indicator" which will visually &amp; by ALERT notify you when conditions are right to monitor a pair. This way you can use human judgment to confirm and enter the trade. I realize this is not "automated" trading, but will come in useful for those manually trading (and help build the logic for the EA to trade). After that I'll get back onto the EA.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hey the Alert is a great idea neal !

--- 帖子 #393 ---
hi neal, what if the candle pierces thru but does not close below or above for sell or buy, do i still enter the trade or i have to wait till it closes below or above.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
This morning we are monitoring EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY - all either outside the river banks or getting close to a signal. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #395 ---
"Piercing" would be an "early entry", but as you can see in this example, the "pierce" of the signal didn't take. It ended up going up +50 pips before starting to come back down. NOTE: The exception to the rule would be if the 13SMA is a long ways away from the red/green dashed line when you get a signal. This is usually due to a large move and we are having retracement. It's ok to get in then without passing both.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Can you take a look at this trade I took in demo this morning. Buy was 1.0235 when it was above the green dash line and above the 13ma but it got stopped out. Did I do anything wrong?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
No, happened to me as well. I'm staying OUT today, waters are to choppy. You did good - followed the signals. As with any method, sometimes market has other things in mind.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
watch usdjpy for another trade setup, i already took 39pips profit. i might re enter again if the conditions are right. i notice that most of the trades setup will usually give an average of 30pips. so i only target 30pips most of the time.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
On days like this one - 30pips might be a good strategy - lol.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
The Euro is over bought. It has to go down.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel on the Aura Indicator. It offers SELL/BUY signals with regular/email alerts. Below is an example of what it looks like. In this case it gave a SELL signal and when the red bar turns gray it's time to exit. This trade would have yielded +65 pips. (most trades are from 20-40 pips) Tomorrow I'll start testing in forward trading. I know of a few bugs to still work out. Will try to have v1.0 out Sunday/Monday so you can start testing. Thanks! Neal p.s. This is a good reason to trade several pairs. The more pairs the better chance of a few signals per day. Looks like it's averaging 1-2 trades/day per pair. Some days there are no trades for a single pair.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Good. Maybe we can see the EA back in progress again.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
We have been waiting ages for your latest creation...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Neal, Many thanks for posting your system at this forum. It is a very interesting approach, and it helps a lot to understand what is happening on each forex pair. Please see the attached EURJPY chart with the standart chart setup. It seems that EURJPY needs to have a little chart setup adjustment (moving averages periods and their "aura") in order to be more in line with EURJPY price action. However, I tried to apply your special GY template and it seems to not be the appropriate one for EURJPY. Perhaps it is necessary to make an other special setup for EURJPY ... You have a lor of experience and a deeper understanding of your chart setup, please can you be so kind to give me your opinion about this subject? Thanks in advance for your help. Pip

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Looks Good!! Will it indicate the 89 entries as well as the 13 entries? And maybe show green bars for buys?? oh boy, oh boy!

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I am posting a real trade made yesterday on EURJPY . On Point 1 you can see the sell setup . The trade starts running and after some time price do a small reversal. Here we can see something special. Point 2 show how SMA13 act as a resistance a little above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Price tested two times 50% Fibonacci level retracement and then went down till the estimated target area – Point 3. Here I was facing a trading dilemma … close position or stay in the trade… the last price bar was a big one and perhaps price can continue down. So .., I decided to stay in the trade. Then price start to move up during 3 bars – Point 4, and start to move down as I desired. Ok, It was another up retracement… and now it will go down to make another lower low – I thought… But reality is quite different from ours wishes, thoughts and expectations… and position was closed at breakeven. What is important here to note is that it was a very nice price move that behaved according to Neal system and we were able to see SMA13 importance and how a price target was meet. Have a nice weekend!! Pip

--- 帖子 #407 ---
OK... but (and I love fibs!).... Isn't our conservative entry on the 89 system to enter at the first close below the 89 aura after a break of the 89 River bank? (your red dashed line...) In which case our entry would be at the OPEN of the candle AFTER yours marked #1.... at about 730... Then, the exit is at the touch of the upper blue aura (on your chart) at about 680... your candle #3. Very vanilla.... and 50pips!!! no real dilemma... eh? Interesting to see the 13 act as resistance, but not really an issue trading the 89 system... only got to 735... Nice and simple... the way to trade...!! I'm all for getting the big moves... but only IF they happen within my trading plan. If not, I have a stop loss plan. But here, 50pips, no fuss, no muss. I know the "goal" is 100p per day. But really, 150p per week is GREAT, and one can live quite well on that. Trying to get too much is the greed part, and will KILL us... really.. been there. To the tune of 70K... but still alive to trade!! And this is ALL just my opinion... please!

--- 帖子 #408 ---
A few time later EURJPY gave another similar trade but with a different behavior. Trade started at Point 1, made a small retracement at Point2 with SMA13 working as a resistance area in line with 61,8% Fibonacci retracement level. Price went down to the Profit Target Area - Point 3 but didn´t stop and break SMA89 as showed at Point 4. Have a nice weekend! Pip

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Doing good guys! Your seeing patterns according to the system. So there was no confusion, I commented on the chart with the correct entry/exit points outlined by the system so it would be clear. SELL ENTRY is below the red dashed line and below the 13SMA (unless the 13SMA is far away due to rapid movement). EXIT is the gray dashed line (blue on this chart) just above the 89SMA. NOTE: the 2nd trade is an ideal example of evaluating a trade before exit. As we can see we could have shifted over to the 13SMA system and stayed in the trade a while longer for extra safe pips. Thanks again for all your interest and support for the system. Neal

Hi Neal, I tried to open some audio and video presentations on this strategy using the following link: However I am not able to see and ear anything.

Great work Neal, but I would like to advise all traders to be careful where they put their money when it comes to "online" Brokers. No matter how good a trading system is, this can all be taken by a crooked Broker. This is very important at this time as the US in particular is in real trouble and financial companies are in real trouble. For 10 years now we have been predicting a deep recession/depression and it's all coming true. In fact we have timed it for exactly now, and we are now predicting a depression or a series of recessions. Folks, this is a serious problem and it will make the 80's recession look like a joke. Buy gold, silver or important commodities like coffee, tea and sugar. Having travelled the world and knowing many Merchant Bankers, my advice is simple, be very careful where and how much money you trade with at this time. Don't let Bush, Fed or anybody else fool you. They lie about everything. The US is going down BIG TIME and so is the majority of the other countries out there. UBS (Switzerland annouced they are laying off 8,000 jobs today). Get my drift ! Neal. I apologise for digressing on your great trading system but Traders have to be aware that no matter how good your system is they need to be very careful with their money at this point in time.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
That is fine Vincent001. What you have to say can affects ANY trading system and everyone needs to be made aware to keep their eyes open. One thing we have going for us is that we can make $$ whether the market goes UP or DOWN. I also agree to choose your broker carefully, they can go out of business as well.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Thanks to all of you who have sent me a private message regarding a recession and security of your money at this time. Neal is quite right, money can be made whether the market is going up or down, and also during difficult economic times. However prudence is the key so if you are going to trade, I suggest you have more than one Broker and spread the risk. The old saying is quite right, "Don't put all your eggs in the one basket".

--- 帖子 #415 ---

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Vicent, Can you tell us what forex pairs you consider the best for this system? I am posting a chart of a not standart trade. Today I notice that EURCHF was doing higher lows (points 1,2,3) so I enter the trade when price broke the +21 level of SMA13 (yellow line) and establish a profit target between -89 and -68 SMA89 lines. It worked very well. Perhaps Neal can tell us his opinion about this approach, and if it can be used when price is very much outside the banks of the river, or if it has a very high risk associated. Have a nice day! Pip

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Today was one of thoes "in the right place at the right time" Asian sessions. When "outside" the river banks, anything can happen, but I would have traded off the 13SMA method and would have resulted in about +110 pips.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi ,nealc99. Your EA is V1.2?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Yes. EA v1.2 is currently being tested and fine tuned. It will be tied to trade the Aura indicator. Hopefully available soon.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi, oh kool ... i m waiting for it Thanks, Goodbadmas P.S. Still making good pips with regular system .. atleast 100 pip a day with 3 to 4 trades !

--- 帖子 #423 ---
It's amazing!!! ... Oanda server's are down at least 10 minutes.... And I a have two positions open ... For the moment I am lucky, let's see... Pip

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Pip, the best thing to do is look at the charts Neal has/is posting for his successful trades. I would suggest that you trade during the market sessions and not outside (not a rule). Neal. This thread seems to have taken off again. I'm really looking forward to this EA as well. I've been waiting for what seems like months ! :-) Will there be a new template as well or just v1.3 ?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Neal, Is that going to be a "demo account only" ex4 again? Thanks, Bernie

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Yes, at least in the beginning it will be "demo" till I'm comfortable that it is stable (aren't you glad v1.1 was demo only). Probably be another 2 weeks of all of us evaluating it to see what it does.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Oh not another Demo again Neal....Geez

--- 帖子 #428 ---
[quote=nealc99;1908091](aren't you glad v1.1 was demo only)/quote] Definitly ^^ (see attached)

Here is a USDJPY today morning chart with a trade example. There are others possible trades examples from today morning specially on EURJPY, EURCHF and GBPUSD I hope that you had the chance to take it. Have a nice day!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
This one has me confused....you enter on the 21 of the 89 but exit on the 13 SMA?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
He entered early is all. According to the 13SMA method you would enter once it has closed ABOVE the +21 level. (I put 12SMA on the chart - typo should have been 13SMA)

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Could any buddy kindly share me with updated perfect EA to run this system? Seems all pairs are suitable to run this EA? Which TF please,H1 better. Tks for your great assistance Ele

--- 帖子 #433 ---
See post #421. Top of this page....

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Here is another EURJPY short chart. You also can see fibo retracement lines using Bobokus Fobonacci retracement lines setup. Interesting? Price below SMA13, near -21 SMA13 line and below Swing Short line. All the swing target's were touched. Have a nice day!! Pip

--- 帖子 #435 ---
How's the Aura indicator coming along?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Yeah we're still waiting Neal, and my cup of tea is very cold now....

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Will talk about the indicator &amp; EA in the next post. Wanted to get these signals out. We have 3 PRIME opportunities to go into a larger than normal 13SMA trade. GBP/USD, USD/CAD and AUD/USD - not the charts and follow the signals. NOTE: It's not uncommon for it to go back the other way some before continuing upward so be prepared for 30-40 pip negative move (hopefully not, but be prepared)

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I have ended up SWAMPED with work this week and haven't had much time to clean up the indicator &amp; EA. The performance is not good at this point. I'm going ahead and releasing the source for the indicator so that perhaps some other EA programmer can troubleshoot and round off the rough edges. 70-80% of the time it does fine for a "guide" of when to start monitoring the market for a valid signal. Most of the signals are on the 13SMA. Things to be added: Alert when signal occurs &amp; email alert. CAUTION: Indicator is "beta" and you should use your judgment to override if necessary.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
So how does it work exactly Neal ????? What are we looking out for or listening to ?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks for sharing the source I'll have a look into it

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Here is a very nice USDJPY long trade. This not a standart Quest 100 System trade, but a very similar one. Trade based on: 1- Price on the Bobukus Fibonacci retracement Swing Long area. 2- Price Close above SMA13. 3- Price closed above SMA89 + 13 line Have a nice day!! Pip

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Here is a chart of a USDJPY sucessufull short trade using the Quest 100 System. Trade conditions: Price below SMA89 +68 line; Price below SMA 15 Price profit traget achieved at SMA89 +13 line. Have a nice day. Pip

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Obviously GREEN is BUY &amp; RED is SELL. I usually wait till I have 2 bars RED/GREEN then go into the trade.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi Neal Actually it's quite a good little indicator Neal. Well done ! Probably just needs a little bit more tweaking.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Neal, why don't you build in an Alert sound for the indicator ?? Sometimes people like myself are away from my desk and need a reminder.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
How to set the indicator?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
How to set the indicator?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
The only setting you would want to change is the Eatime which is the TF on which the indicator is applied. If you set it on M15, Eatime should be 15. On hourly, eatime should be 60 and so on.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I mean how to add the indicator on MT4.....Seriously I trade using a platform that doesn't support EA.........I'm only MT4 for chartist not trade....

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Put it in the indicator folder and then attach it to a chart. Easy.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
BUT I DONT HAVE THE INDICATOR......CAN YOU GIVE ME THE TEMPLATE THATS COME ALONG WITH THE INDICATOR?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
The indicator can be found on post 438

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I see your frustration. Just read the whole forum and you will understand.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
THANKS BUT HOW TO READ THE SIGNAL?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
You are kiddin' ? Green for buy, red for sell... Is it so difficult to understand ? Maybe your questions are not properly worded or something... PS : And stop typing upper case, this is irritating. We can hear you...

--- 帖子 #457 ---
SORRY TO BE RUDE.......A CARING TRADER NEVER BLAME SOMEONE WHO WANT TO LEARN................. THATS AN IDIOT ANSWER.....NO PROVE......I WANT A BABY STEP TEACH..... AND WHAT I WANT IS HOW TO READ THE SIGNAL FOR BUY OR SELL.....FOR AURA INDICATOR AND AURA+QUEST 100 INDICATOR

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Is your Capslock broken or what ? Writting in uppercase is plain rude ! What you ask is written in the topic from page 1. So please read from page 1 down to here. You are not asking for babystep teach, you are asking to be spoon fed... PS : and thanks for saying my response was idiot, that is so rewarding trying to help you :-/

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Breaking the ice... I found something funny, hope I can post the URL else the admin can delete this post: ..... oh, never mind .

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Look no offence Baby Trader, but wouldn't it be better if you just went somewhere else where you could learn the basics first. Try www.babypips.com Unbelievable.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
First Lesson.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Neal I hope you haven't forgotten about us !!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I think to make this thread more lively and build up our confidence with this system, I suggest that we post our trading result using this system. i took buy order of EUR/USD at 1.5369 (price open above the green line + confirmation from aura indicator) and close it at 1.5425 for +56 pips.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Neal, when are you going to be putting on another trading room?

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Today morning I performed 3 trades, 2 losing trades (EURJPY) and one wining trade (USDJPY). I entered EURJPY at point 1 and after some time I stoped and reversed at point 2. The short trade was running well and I changed my Initial Stop loss to reduce trade risk. Then news came and I was stopped again with a minor loss. USDJPY short was my best trade using Quest 100 system. Thank God!! Have a nice day! Pip

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Anyone heard from Neal recently?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I closed a few moments ago a good trade on EURJPY. I didn't risk much and I prefered to take a profit when it seems to be a good place to take it - Swing Target 2 (156.483). Have a nice day!! Pip

--- 帖子 #468 ---
No he seems to have disappeared !

--- 帖子 #469 ---
He must be putting the final touches on that ever elusive indicator and EA!!!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Ahh yes the illusive EA ! Will it ever arrive I wonder. Actually Neal has a tendency to surprise sometimes but it has been a while since we heard from him.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Has anyone PM'ed him?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Come one guys, leave him alone. Maybe he is on holiday, maybe he has too much work to do, maybe he wants to relax some time. Who knows. Anyway, if he wants to show up here, he will

--- 帖子 #474 ---
hi, first of all i want thank neal for publishing this great system. I was just wondering if you are experiencing the same problem with the indicator. There are differences in signals shown when running the indicator on a chart the whole day and comapare those signals with a fresh chart from the same day. Do you have the same problem?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I have not checked yet the indicator but it is possible that it repaints which is not a good sign

--- 帖子 #476 ---
The indicator does appear to be very unstable and it does "repaint" I would not attempt to use it for trading as a stand alone indicator. Just place it on a short timeframe and you will see what happens - remember to change the indicator parameters. When Neal released it he did stress that it was BETA version only.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Or maybe his new system is THAT profitable...

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Yes Neal is alive and well. Indicator was posted in an "unfinished" state because I have been overwhelmed with normal (paying) work and probabbly will be that way till after the tax season (April 15th). I have been manually trading and doing well. 40-80 pips per day. It is a good system for manual trading as long as you have the time to monitor it. Thanks for keeping me in your thoughts and will try to post a little more often. Neal

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Well we all have to work Neal but by now you should know of course that we take first priority over your employment (SMILE).

--- 帖子 #480 ---
hi, i found the repaint problem and think i could fix it. So attached you can find the indicator which should work now as intended. have fun

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Just to let you know, I'm still arround and trading the system on a daily basis. It still out performs most systems I've seen. Made +107 pips yesterday - LIVE account! Most days are 50-80 pips. Have decided that there are too many "nuances" for an EA to be able to deal with (market news, slow times of the market day, and several others that I've picked up by manually trading). I'm removing the EA from the first post at this time. This system is best traded manually with judgement calls on the part of the trader. Anyone else using the system?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hey there Neal, What is the current setup/system you are using for the daily? Can you please recap with the lastest info? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Post #1 has the latest strategy along with a Audio/Visual Presentation on the Strategy which explains all as well.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Today morning we had a EURCHF very good trade. If you look at USDCHF and EURAUD you will see another examples. Here is the EURCHF chart. Have a nice day! Pip

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi Neal, Was wondering if you were going to be doing anymore live trading rooms. Also are you still working on the aura indicator?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Can you post some possible trade set ups when you see them so I can follow along and make sure I'm seeing and doing the entries correct.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
hi neal is it right for me to enter a trade here. or can anybody else tell me. thanks. NB. i read through the first post again but i still cant figure out where the danger zone is?(where you should not enter trades) can you pls just mark it on this attached chart for me.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Neal, Are you going to be posting anymore on this thread? It seems to have died without you.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
It seems to be an excellent method to catch solid entries at reversal points. I hope Neal checks in with his progress and any refinements. Video is excellent too. I'm going to work with this. Is anyone using the chatroom? Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hey folks Are these EA's designed for a five digit broker? Warm Regards, fxtrader08

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Guys, Is anyone still using this great looking method. I have read it through and I am going to try and start testing it tomorrow. I was surprised that the thread has died. Is there another thread going on now somewhere with the same trading methods ? And does anyone have a copy of the EA as I think it is no longer on teh this thread. thanks alot for any feedback. Mike
