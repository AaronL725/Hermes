In another thread I talked about range trading. Instead of specific entrance and exit points you trade within a range of a currency's move. So if price stays within a certain range for the day, you cant lose money that day. You can have losing trades but not lose money. This EA has a range of 800 pips, as long as price does not go outside of 800 pips in one day you are safe. I have done a study of currencies and very few currencies go beyond a 800 pips in one day. We do not use the Eur/Aud, Gbp/jpy, Gbp/nzd, Gbp,chf for that reason. There are some exotics I would not use like mexican, kron, etc. I have 12 that are in the zip file and ready to go. The EA trades pennies and I have only attached a non adjustable EA. They are set a .01 per lot. If you are with a micro that trades pennies thats 1 cents per trade, with regular and mini accouts thats .10 a trade. I used IBFX to test this with. The logic is very simple if price moves 100 pips in any direction it takes profit, it reenters every 80 pips. As price moves in one direction it profits every 100 and reenters the opposite direction every 80 pips and multiplies times 2. So the 10 levels will go something like this: .01,.02,.04,.08,.16,.32,.64,1.28,2.56,5.18 When price reverses it takes profit from the trade going the opposite direction. The philosophy is very simple. Every day has a high and a low. When price heads for its high/low for the day we take profit going up/down. When price reverses and heads for its low/high for the day we profit going back. As price does that the margin deficit goes down and the difference between it and our captured profit is our profit for the day. When that happens you close everything and start again the next day. I recommend you start at 0 or 1 GMT or around the JPY open and begin looking for your profit at the middle of the Eur session or beginning of the USA session 10-18 GMT time. We close down our EA and all trades every day to prevent price from sneaking over our 800 pip range. WE never hold trades over the weekend. Use a demo account with at least 5000 dollars and test it out. If you have an account that uses ten cent lots you will probably need to test with at least 10,000. I will attach the zip package this post and tell where to put them the next post. Also more info on how this system works is found at posts 1-4, post #72 the MQ4 is found there. Post #74 pg. 5 gives the philisophical workings of the system and post #79 gives a pictorial view of how the system works. Page 9 post#125 gives my 7 year currency facts sheet. Post #192 gives some personal thoughts about trading Post #267 P. 18 gives the odds of breaking 800 pips in one day Post #306 P. 21 gives how to change the account protection settings in the code. Post # 521 &amp; 522 on p. 35 have an important new tool for determining which currencies to use. Very important new information see page37 posts 541-549 Post #591 Has a new indicator that maybe helpful to use with this system.

1. Ok put the EA in your experts folder, 2. put the templates in the first templates folder 3. put the 100x80 folder in your profiles folder close your MT4 and reopen go to profiles and open the 100x80 turn on the EA and good luck This was designed on IBFX MT4 I am assuming the profiles will work on other MT4 systems. Here is a pic playing with .05 a trade, it won about 4500 in 3 days on a 50,000 demo account. That was so scary I toned it down to .01 and want to see if it works on a 5000 demo. let me know what you think good luck. Those of you who have an accounts that play dimes and not pennies you will need a larger account.

Your charts should look like this, the buy is in black and the sells are in white. The first set of dotted lines on either side of the green entrance lines are your first level of TP. The dotted lines are 825 pips away from your entrance on both sides is your emergency stop losses. The solid red lines 700 pips above and below the daily open are your warning EA limit lines. They show you if price has been staying with the range of the EA every day and you can backtest by eyesight using them. The most important thing you can do to protect yourself is to close and restart the EA every day to give you the full 800 pip range of the EA. Good luck.

To you that are used to 20-50 pip stop losses and trading large lots this thread will be a shocker to you. We trade pennies and many currencies to make decent profits. Most of you will shake your heads and it wont register. Thats ok, I quit trading that way about 9 months ago and started making money. The problem I faced is there was a dynamic change in the markets 3 weeks ago and I had to change my EA that was so successful before. This is my new system to take on the chaos of the present market. It has not been tested very long, 3 days, but is based on a proven system that worked when the market was not in chaos. This is my answer to the Chaos market of today and will probably stay this way in the months or years to come. I still want to make money in forex. The goal of this EA is to increase your account 2-5% a week. Not to make you a millionaire over night. Greed will kill you so to protect the foolish I only posted the .01 a trade EA.

Thanks again Bob. You are brilliant as usual, always upto something.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Bob, Thanks a lot for sharing yet another great insight into what makes Forex such an interesting market to trade. I have been following your EAs with great interest. Am using the 100 * 125 EAs with good results!! Please confirm the required setup - 1. Open two charts per currency traded 2. Apply buy template to first &amp; sell template to second. This should result in a pair of buy / sell orders per pair. Would these orders be opened immediately, or could there be some delay? On one or two of the pairs I seem to only get one order, even though the setup is as above. Thank you, Suzette

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yes use two charts per currency pair one a buy, one a sell. Yes it should open both directions at the same time. I am using a 2MA on a daily as my trigger so there may be a case where one side may not open until it gets below the high or above the low, but yes 95% of the time it should immediately open in both directions. The only real decision point is when to close for the day and restart the next day. I encourage to do this until we get a good feel of the EA. I see I need to post my close all script. I think I forgot to put it in the original package. Also, set all the currencies at 1D charts to start. This will download all the Daily history. When you first start up a new demo it may take it a couple of minutes to get all the info on a currency. This will delay its entrance, so give the MT4 time to download all the info of a currency pair and then it should be ready to go. If you still have problems, try restarting the MT4. Let me know if you have any more problems.

Hi esters, bob mention to place the 100x80 in the profile folder. After unzipping, your zip program may create a folder call 100x80. If so, the charts will not get loaded automatically. The chart01.chr - chart25.chr have to be on the same level as your "100X80 BUY SELL 01" folder. Close the MT4 and restart, the charts which bob place in should open up automatically. Bob has already include which pairs to trade in the package. You don't even have to manually open the charts one by one. Thanks bob for the great job. A picture speaking a thousand word. Please refer to the attachedd pic if you do not know what I'm talking about.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
bob, are you closing all trades at the end of the day (before the US market starts) and restart them the next day (before japan market starts)?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I will close them at some kind of profit. There is a point where the market retraces and the wins have more in the bank than the deficit you are carrying. We will have to see how it goes. After seeing hundreds going in at .05 I have 23.00 so far today at .01. So not the spectacular results today. But I want to know if I can run this on 3000 so I will start conservatively. I want to see what happens during the USA session. This is a new concept in trading so I want to see how it goes. Maybe we will find running it all week is the best way but right now we really dont know. Happy testing.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Good first day. Easily could have traded on a 500 dollar account but was also a slow day. A 2.5% increase of the account. See what happens tomorrow. Since I am only 3 levels deep on any currency and only carrying a 35.00 negative running balance I will let it run all day and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
good luck bro..

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I forgot the close all in my original package. Put this in your scripts folder. When you are done for the day or week, turn off the EA and turn this on from the scripts folder. It will close all the trades for you so you dont have to do them manually. If you want to close only for one currency just close one of the trades of that currency and the EA will close the rest. However, it will open a new trade as soon as they are all closed. So if you dont want that you can turn off the EA and remove the EA from those currency charts and then turn the EA back on.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Bob, are you using a $3,000 MINI IBfx acc for your test (where trading 0.01 lots 1 pip=1cent of $)? Please, advise, thanks. Take

--- 帖子 #15 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Bob, did you make some math? Do you realized that with a step of 100 and a T/P of 80, using all 10 levels (but even less of ten) you will close the entire cicle in loss (a BIG loss)?! I don't think is a good idea to start trading an EA that bring to an INEVITABLE loss after the first levels are used, do you agree? To be winner, at the end of the entire cicle of ten trades (but even before of that), you have to double the lots AND, above all, you MUST use a 100 pips T/P, like the pips interval (step) you use among each trade. It's a math matter, Bob, nothing more.... Please, think about this. Take

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi all Ive been trading with all the pairs Bob suggests that are available with FXDD which I think is 3 less than with IBFX. Opened trades 2 hours into the Euro session and closed out all trades 10 hours later for a gain of $81.00, happy with that, max draw down was 180 though. Hey Bob can you tell us what the actual risk is if the EA is left to run right through to the stop loss. Thanks James

--- 帖子 #18 ---
When I demo tested this there was a GBP/JPY trade that went 10 levels and it profited. I chose these 10 currencies so they wouldnt go 10 levels. 4-6 should be their limit except for the eur/jpy.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
the stop loss is set at 825, it is just for emergencies, it is not a realistic SL. I only have one for very unusual happenings. The currencies I picked have almost no chance except the eur/jpy of going 800 points in one day. However, in these markets lately who can tell.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Bob, I don't agree with the 825 S/L, because if the EA can trade till 10 levels, this means it will cover 100x9=900 pips range, so, a S/L less than 900 pips don't make sense, it should be, even if it's an "emergency" S/L, at least, let me say, 950 pips. If you set an emergenxy S/L of 825 pips, what is the sense to have an EA that can trade 10 levels (=900 pips range)?! The last 10th level, if you leave this 825 pips S/L unchanged, could be quietly cut off, because the price will hit the S/L at 825 pips BEFORE that 10th level at 900, or, better, the price will NEVER trade the 10th level due to the earlier S/L.... Another point: you choose 12 pairs, but at least 3 of them (AUDJPY, GBPUSD and EURJPY), have had at least one daily range much higher than 800 pips; please, check, for instance, on last 24 of october, you will see a daily range for those pairs between 900 and 1200 pips! So, I personally set up your EA in a way that MATEMATICALLY gurantee me a profit even trading all the 10 levels (again, it's useless to have a tool programmed to trade 10 levels when, after the 3rd-4th level traded, I already know that the EA will close all those "cycle" of trades in loss, like your 100x80 will do, so, YOU CANNOT AFFIRM THAT YOUR EA REALLY COVER A 800 PIPS RANGE, BUT MUCH LESS PIPS, INSTEAD!). My modified EA: Pairs (12): EURUSD, USDJPY, EURGBP, USDCHF, EURCHF, CHFJPY, NZDUSD, AUDUSD, AUDCAD, NZDCHF, AUDCHF, AUDNZD. Take Profit: 90 pips Step: 90 pips Pips range REALLY covered (ALWAYS in profit): 90x9 = 810 So, mine will be the newest "90x90 oh guy EA"! Regards, Take

I closed down for the week. I never like being in the USA session on Friday, I dont want to be forced into the weekend holding onto trades. Two reasons: 1. If you have a bad USA session it kind of puts a damper on a good week. 2. Gaps in prices over the weekend are uncontrollable and can mess up the reentrance matrix of the EA. I closed my two day test on my EA and it has done very well. Increased my account 5.7%. That is a two day profit of trading pennies of $170.43. Not bad. I also think at this point I could trade .02-.03 on 3000 or trade .01 on 1000 to 1500 but it really takes several weeks of testing to see that. Anyway here is my chart. You may ask why the sudden jump in the chart. Well it works like this as the market goes in one direction it keeps making these 1 level profits so you get this nice smooth line going up at a steady angle. Then when the market reverses and the 2-5 level trades hit profit the account takes a big leap. At that point you close your trades for the day and that is where you see the slow slope back down. I restarted the EA and it started its slow slope back up again and when I saw a small profit for Friday I took it and was done for the week. This is the type of account action you will see with this EA.

Hi Nanningbob, Many thanks for sharing. There are not a huge amount of posts but that is because we are watching and learning.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi all. Just thought I'd post a graph of my last 2 days using this EA. I have dropped the Eur/jpy just after the last little jump. I would rather have less in the bank than be constantly worrying that it might have gone berserk while I wasn't watching. Using this demo account you have to trade 10 cents per pip so I just drop one place to get the figures as they would be live on 1 cent per pip trades. The results for the 2 days. First day 10 hours only. Second day right through the Asian session, reset near the start of the Euro session and closed out all a couple of hours into the US session. $221.00 trading 1cent per pip. This is an encouraging start. The other interesting thing is that given the 10 cents per pip on this demo account the account deposit is effectively 300 dollars not 3000. Have a good weekend Rest up some James

Here's my first days results running this expert and trade strategy. +$144 with $28 margin required using default .01 lots on an IBFX mini demo account. There was no drawdown. Trades were opened a bit early at 23:00 GMT and closed about 14:00 GMT. As a red-blooded male I usually find curves the most beautiful(!) but that straight, 30 degree line certainly puts a smile on my face. We'll have to wait for another shoe to drop in the financial markets to see how well this boat floats. The small drop at the end of the day was closing out all trades with a small negative equity P/L. Thanks for the new strategy Bob.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Bob Firstly, thanks for all your hard work - and more to the point, for sharing it! Also you make it so easy with templates and profiles all ready to go..... it's very much appreciated. Attached is my graph - I opened around 8.00 GMT 30/10 and closed 18.30 GMT 31/10 The dip around order 53 was when I found my laptop had been hung for 2 hrs and had to restart..... I had to close all the trades as terminal wouldn't re-engage the EA - I probably had too many instances of terminal running at the same time. The bobble around order 193 was when I manually closed AUDJPY it was at level 5 and had just failed to reach it's take profit by 2 pips and was heading back south fast, (I've seen the AJ make major one way traffic recently), so decided to close that down and also just to get the feel of taking manual control. I had some largish drawdown with -140 open positions at one time and -60 at another (these were when I was monitoring the PC - there may have been others that I didn't see) - the graph doesn't show them....... is it only in backtesting that the equity line is also shown? I would like to be able to get a more accurate picture of what the position was throughout the run. All the best Jim PS This demo was run on IBFX mini account - My live account is with Alpari UK and uses the 5th digit and each pip is approx £0.05 ($0.08) so I need to find a UK broker that offers mini's - any suggestions?

Thanks nanningbob for this EA. My setup is ready I will start demo trading from Monday. Mine is not a IBFX platform and I want to know whether it will work alright because I see 'm' added to all pairs. Do I need to change anything?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Bob, Thank you, the EA &amp; automated setup provided worked like a charm!! Herewith my results for 30-31 Oct, IBFX mini, Open bal = $2000, closed all open trades at about 13h00 (GMT) yesterday manually, net profit $213. I will add the CloseAll script today. Setup ran uninterrupted, except for about 1.5 hrs on Thursday afternoon when my internet connection was down. Suzette P.S. This is my first attempt at attaching a file, hope I got it right.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
My profiles is set to an IBFX mini account. I dont know if that changes anything on other types or not since I have never tried on any other account. The only thing to do is run it on a demo and see what happens. You may have to make some adjustments or set up your own templates.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Nanningbob, Watching your posts with interest. Traded this type of method before; it always ended in tears--wiped account. Maybe you have solved how to make it work? Good luck and thank you for your hard work and generosity. gtrade.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
As long as you stay in the range of the EA the system willwork. The other systems never had a big enough range or traded too large sums of money to work. Stick with pennies and dont let greed take over and it can work. If you treat it as a non get rich quick system, it is possible.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
It won't run on other platforms. Profile did not open any chart. How do I alter the Profile?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Actually it is set for Micro accounts. So if you have a standard or mini account it probably doesnt work. I will post new ones when I get home.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
My problem is that charts do not open. Micro account problems comes after that I think, once EA starts. It has to do with 'm' at the end of each pair. I need to remove that in my Profile. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
OK go to market watch, third button from left in the upper left, has a green up arrow and a red down arrow. This brings up all the currencies, (if it doesnt show all the curencies right click on it and click show all) drag the currency pair you want to the screen and that should open the chart for that pair. This is something that happens occasionally with MT4, dont know why but that is how they told me to handle a currency pair screen that would not show. I hope this solves the problem you are facing.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
That solved my problem actually! I have saved this profile now. Let us see how this EA performs now...But this microlot has to be entered individually for every pair? Doesn't matter, EA is up and working.. So far 1400 pips netted with a floating loss of -1200 pips. I could not keep system running for more than few hours due to power interruption. Using hedging pairs as you mentioned in other thread ( trader101 pairs) is an interesting possibility.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Nanningbob, Did you trade Monday? I started a demo and I noticed on a $1,000 account it got up to about $1,007 but is now down to about $980. I was wondering if you traded yesterday and how you went.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I took a beating on the GBP/USD but with my other ones being profitable I closed with a 70 dollar loss. So got out with some scratches. Will restart later today and see what happens. I am trading this live with a 500 dollar account. The GBP/USD is sitting at S2 and normally I would play that bounce but I cant be home to watch it so I closed and went to work. I just saw GBP/USD break S2 so I am glad I got out, saved an extra 50 bucks.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
When did u start ur trade ? If u start @ GMT 0:00 , ur money will be positive. I think we should test this from the start of Asia session and end the trades whenever our target profit is reached. Also, only pick those pairs which has less spread and those which have average daily range of about 200 to 450 pips. For IBFX, maybe only trade those which has less than 6 pips spread. nanningbob, did u take part in IBFX contest for this month ?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Let's see how it goes. Btw, GBPUSD gone out of control yesterday. It moves more than EURJPY. I excluded EURJPY and GBPUSD due to US president election today (Both have bad record of going out of control). AUD has interest rate decision today but i guess it will stay in 800 pips range so it's in my list

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Do we need to close all our positions whenever we stop trading? Does this EA open new set of trades whenever start afresh? It looks like that.. How to avoid it. Though my trades are at a loss now, performance is not bad considering present condition and it could have positive if I avoided certain trades. Certainly we need to select pairs carefully.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes we are in a testing phase of this program. One thing in forex trading is you will have losing days. But I have found out if you minimized losses the EAs are profitable. Right now we want to avoid pairs that are too volatile so that limits us to maybe a dozen that will work consistently. I dont like trading the full USA session and I like to be out before noon or before the USA session starts. I decided to let it run today and ended up with a total loss or -77 dollars. I could have closed before noon with a small profit. But then if I could predict the future I would be a trillionaire. The vast majority of days the vast majority of currency pairs will go to a high and then to a low or visa versa. You catch that move and close out it is profitable. If you hang on too long or the market only does one direction without a retrace somewhere (very rare) you can have a losing day. I hung on because I didnt like the small profit so I tried the afternoon session and got burned. Last week I did an afternoon session and made over 150 today I lost 77. So you take the good with the bad.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Bob, I just sent you a PM for a filter for the EAto buy only sell only please see the PM and see if you can code it and Ill test it out thanks Let me know M4X

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Still in trade. Sum of all trades for today +100 pips so far. EURJPY and GBPUSD seems to be in good shape for trading using this system. Too bad i didn't include them. Could have easily earn more than 100 pips if i include them. It looks like if you start the trade around Asia open should be able to profit around London open. I also found out that this system trade well when there is News because it might help you to clear some of your position very fast. I wonder if this system will be good for NFP this Friday.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
+/- all position, +200 pips now Should i close ? I guess not, i am greedy

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Pictures speak many words

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Very nice. How long u have been using this system ? Which pair are you trading ? What time do u start/close for the day ? Thnx

--- 帖子 #48 ---
One day, found this thread yesterday. all 12 pairs as mentioned in post 1 I start at 1 GMT close before end of trading day Thnx[/quote]

--- 帖子 #49 ---
your Performance report has more than 200 trades. Does it include other trades u are doing or only this sytem for today ? How many lot are u trading ?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I suggest you read the first few posts.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
So u just use the default of everything i guess. I though u would have change things a bit here and there to suit ur needs

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Close all my trade. +300 pips for today. I am using IBFXmini. Only trading 6 pairs. Started all my trade on GMT+0 0:00 EURUSD EURCHF USDCHF USDJPY USDCAD AUDUSD Using micro lot. Position size 0.01 lot for 1 pip = 1 cent.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Changed nothing as this is the first time i am testing this, may be after a week of testing I will see if a change is required

--- 帖子 #54 ---
What needs to be changed or monitored ? How are you managing money management setting?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
All the setting i am using is default setting. The thing i look out for is the pair to trade and the time to start the trade. I think it's importance that you start your trade around Asia open. Becoz it's rare that all the session will travel in a straight line without 100 pips retrenchment.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Are these the ones to change , Look at the picture Barry

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Yes, those are the ones to change. And don't forget to also change the s/l from 825 to 900. Take

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Ok it took me less than 24 hours to recover from the Gbp/usd trade, then the eur/usd decided to test my patience but it retraced for a profit so I am up for the week. I am trying this live with 500 dollars and using the 10 slowest pairs. I dropped gbp/usd because of only using 500. So will get back with you all later.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Have you tried any other settings for TP and using a trailing SL. Is there any basis for TP of 100?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
i think the current configuration is good. I'm up 600 pips about an hour ago. Yesterday was up 300 pips.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I am also up around 400 pips with hardly any floating loss. Started 4 hrs ago.. I removed EURCHF AND CHFJPY. I am only using USDCAD, USDJPY, EURUSD, AUDUSD, AUDJPY, EURJPY, GBPUSD and USDCHF. I am also following trader101, so these pairs are on either side of his BUY SELL (4 each) Basket. Just an hunch that these will provide hedge. Floating loss is around 200 pips only after netting 600 pips so far today.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Nice. Anyone trading this live ? I only know nanningbob live this system. Demo and live always have different result although using the same EA. I have read so many post on forum that their broker hunt their account till it dry out.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I have tried many different packages over the year and the 100 TP has always been the most profitable and stable. If you have a smaller TP you have a smaller range on the EA and if you go bigger you will have currencies that wont hit it. It is a mathematical formula I have used and seems to be the most successful. You can go to the other thread and read how this was all developed over the last 10 months. Trailing SL would not work because of the multiple levels, it will close out a trade before it becomes profitable.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks very much. Finally, what about multiplication factor? I see that double lots are used in succeeding orders. Is ir essential? Can we avoid that? I am itching to go live with a micro account now..800 pips today with 200pips floating minus at present.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I am testing this system and in the first day has given me positive results provided that you set the lots up to 0,04-3 max with a deposit of 5,000 $. Concerning your issue about brokers chasing your account, I believe this is a pure legend. If I go live with this system, I will open the same positions on a demo and a real account. If my broker chases my real account and my demo has far better positive results, it will not take much to show him that he has to reimburse me all the "chasen" profits. But I do not think this will never happen: remember, serious brokers risk their job if you can prove the regulation authority that they cheat clients. I do not think this is in their best interest!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Here is my live for this week so far. You can see where I took out the GBP/USD and later CHF/JPY. We will see how the rest of the week shows.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I wanted to go live as well. But i need to find a good broker which use mt4 platform. I am living in Asia and i think interbank fx might be a good option for me. I'm planning to deposit around $300 mini account trading 0.05 lots on 6 currency pairs. So far my demo with $300 on interbankfxmini has been great. Max dd i saw was around -$25. What do u guys think about interbank fx for this system ?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I have close all my trades, this is my result for today. Thnx nanningbob for the birth of this system.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I think T101 basket trading system doesn't really do the magic in this system. IMO, we should select pairs to trade based on our account size and the risk u willing to take. I guess if u are trading this live, ur account must not be less than $1000 since u are trading the "heavy duty" pairs, EURJPY, GBPUSD, AUDJPY. As for me, i remove the heavy duty pair and go to safe pair since I am planning only to deposit around $300 account and i don't wanna margin call my account anytime soon.

I think IBFX is the only option for MT4 now. My account is ready to be funded which I wanted to use for Trader101 system. Go live soon so that I will have one more person to guide me in future!

I just want to know the two settings: Multiply and Max Trades. Can they be adjusted to limit exposure.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I ran the ea last night (started 0400 gmt) and picked up approx 2400 pips. When I woke up &amp; checked there was a 540 pip floating loss but that went away &amp; I closed out the trades about 1400 gmt with minimal floating loss. I closed one trade manually for 600 pips that was trying to get to its TP level as I figured why risk letting that fade away. it was close anyway. I plan on running it again beginning with the Asian open or there abouts. Very interesting. I must say Bob your work is way over my head but it is truly a generous thing that you share your insights with everyone.

Here is the original version of the program so you can go in and make changes. I have it set at .02 a trade instead of .01.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
The math, exponential numbers etc. can be complicated but this is as simple I can make the system so you understand the basics. You are trading both ways within a 800 point range of your entry. It is basically the odds are price will move over 100 pips in one direction on any currency on any given day. It will then retrace at some point creating a profit margin between what it has banked and the leftover negative balance which begins reducing because of the retracement. The three uglies are: 1. price goes over 800 pips in one direction without a major retracement creating what we call a death trade. A large loss. Price goes outside the range of the EA. GBP/JPY, EUR/AUD examples. (a possibility but unlikely scenario if you play the slower currencies) Also NZD currencies will sometimes just spike 1000 pips or more. This has happened several times recently. 2. Price only goes in one direction for the day thereby not creating the profit scenario. This can happen on some days so you play multiple currencies in the hope that when one or two currencies do this the others will make enough profit to overcome the ones that didn't. This scenario usually happens when you use crosses that have a major currency matched with a minor currency. USD/CAD, NZD/USD, EUR/AUD, GBP/NZD.etc The minor currencies simply dont have enough power to overcome a major currency fundamental move. They simply are not strong enough to cause a retracement. You should try to use majors with majors and minors with minors aud/nzd, eur/gbp, eur/usd etc. Some of you have thought about using trader 101 system with this and I have thought about that too but you must be very careful with the major/minor crosses for that reason. 3. The third ugly which just started in the marketplace 4 weeks ago, the news is so bad that 800 pips is not enough room. I dont play the gbp/jpy, eur/jpy, gbp/chf and any pound currency right now for that reason. Even the good old standby gbp/usd is going nuts. If you use only currencies that stay within that range and you exit at some point every day and restart the next. You should make a profit almost every day. That in a nutshell is it. Before the economic crisis I safely traded a similar system using a 400 pip range for 6 months and it worked well. This is my attempt to trade this volatile market. I am having some good days and some bad days. This is a very difficult market to trade. Just to give you an idea of how volatile it has been. I am used to making 5-15% a week with my various EAs. Last week I put 500 dollars into a live account and yesterday it had tripled to just under 1500. Then in less than 30 minutes the EUR/CAD spiked almost 300 points and bye bye 300 dollars. That didnt happen on this ea in this post but on another one that had been going very strong for me. It is just a very volatile market and can be very scary at times.

Thanks and I do appreciate you taking your time to explain your work.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Those words are golden. I think it will benefit anyone who is new to this system by posting it in post #1. Especially the part where u explain how the EA wouldn't work. One thing i would like to point out is that the slowest currency wouldn't work well. The currency pair i had observe which wouldn't work well is EURGBP. Some of the day it wouldn't/barely touch 100 pips and it move very very slowly. If the market is back to what it used to be, EURGBP would not work with this EA. To play safe, i wouldn't have EURGBP in my list. Anyone using this system trading with EURGBP ?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Bob, What system and pairs managed to do this?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
This is why I posted this EA early. I cant honestly answer that question at his time. The best pairs are the ones that wont go over 600 pips a day.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Here is a visual presentation of the system and how it works. I am using the GBP/USD for an example over a 3 day period. The white dotted lines are every 24 hours, the double line is the start of the week. Letter A: Monday you turn on the EA and it enters both directions. Letter B: As it heads for letter B it will profit every 100 pips and enter negatively every 80 so you are putting money in the bank but you have a growing deficit. Letter C: Price has now retraced to your beginning point and the profits accumulated going up and the profits accumulated going down are greater than your accumulated deficit. You close for the day and you are in profit. Letter D: Price continues to run and by the end of the day your deficit is greater than your profit. You now can take a loss for the day or wait the next day to see if you get enough retracement to bring you back into profit. Letter E: Price retraces from the low enough to bring you back to a profit or minimize your loss to an acceptable level. The distance from Monday's low to E is 126 pips. You either have taken profit or close enough not to lose much money. Day 2 scenario: This is the most common trading scenario for most currencies. Letter E is your entrance you go to F. Letter F price reverses and starts heading for its high for the day. Letter G is your high and now price reverses. Letter 2nd E: you have had a great day because you did 3 profit runs E to F then F to G and then the deficit is reduced when it goes to the second E (sorry I meant to put an H there) This is the most common currency day, prices goes to one direction reverses goes to its high/low and then settles back some before the day ends. You can see another version of it after day 2. Price does not have to go back near the starting point to be successful it just needs enough of a reversal to lessen the carried deficit to where the take profits are greater. Obviously the most profitable days is when the reversal is over 100 points. I hope this visual helps you understand how this is suppose to work. As long as we stay within that 2-700 pip range it works great.

I have never done my own thread before so if someone can point me to how I can go back to page one put these posts there it would be great.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I'm very interested with this EA. I think this EA is relatively safe... Is it absolutly free? without re-registration or update? Why eurgbp does'nt exist in 100x80 template? Does eurgbp no fit with this EA? Can you tell me what pairs that can not fit with this EA...? And lastly, why you dont release the mq4 file? FYI, I ran this EA continue (overnight) and never close manualy the position but still profit. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Thanks nanningbob, For your great EA and your very patient replies. My demo produced 10% rise yesterday which was particularly good day with wild swings. Your posting mq4 is not of much use to me I think, since I am new to all this. I have some technical background and let me see whether I can learn this one. I am keen on going live, but I have few doubts about DD: I see that succeeding orders are placed with higher lots, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 etc. Is it essential? Is it ok to limit it to 0.1 only? Is it ok to avoid US session, when wild swings happen and it is really heart stopping.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
If u tested the system and it work, why u want to change it ? There is always reason for the logic of this system. Please re-read the whole thread if u have to, ur answer is right in this thread. Please be careful when u go live. If not u might blow up ur account. This system win most of the time and when it comes to losing it's not gonna be small. However, if u understand what this system is doing, u will be fine and on ur road to the gold mine. Just spend some of ur time to read this whole thread again. It's not hard to understand this system.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
ha.. you really need this EA don't you? eurgbp fluctuations are not high enough to be include here. Minimum 100 pip swing are essential for it to work but not very high like jpy pairs.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Can't you just click the edit button on the first post? That would be my guess.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The edit button disappears when a new page is made so I dont see one. I know there is a way but dont know how to get there.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Yes it is free. It was posted several years ago. A guy named Azaam made some changes and then I borrowed and made some changes. So it is forever free. I have released the file about a couple of posts ago so you or anyone else can play with it. The Eur/gbp generally will not move enough to be effective with this EA. The best pairs will be known when I update my 7 year currency facts. I need an entire afternoon to do that and I just havent had time lately. Maybe this weekend.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
How's everyone doing today on this system ? I'm positive again. Giving it about 3 more hours and i will cash my trades. GREAT ! Looking forward to it. I guess the 6 pairs i had chosen to trade must be inside your list

--- 帖子 #89 ---

Is it ok to avoid US session, when wild swings happen and it is really heart stopping." I am trying this EA now using 500 dollars live. Almost had a heart attack with the GBP/USD the first day but I have recovered from it and now am on the profit side. The higher lots is what makes the system work and allows for the range of the EA. If you put them all at .01 and it goes 400 points against you, you need a 500 point move to get profit. If you increase your lots then you still only need the 100 point retracement for profit. What is nice about this though is in some cases you may not need the full 100 point retracement to make a profit. If you play 8 currencies and 4 retrace a 100 points or more and 4 donot you can still be profitable. Avoid the USA session is advisable but not always neccessary, I like to start at the JPY session and see if I got a profit before I get to the USA session. If I do then I close out and am done. However, if it is a particular slow day then you can play it. However, if you do play with the right currencies that dont move more than 4-600 points a day it would be safe all day. I actually designed this system to trade the GBP/JPY because my earlier EAs couldnt cover its range. Now the GBP/JPY goes over a 1000 on a regular basis but other currencies now seem to fit. Testing and some long term provability is what this EA needs. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
DD draw down can be a major issue if a currency just continues to go in one direction all day and never retrace. Currencies do that but to go 800 points and never retrace is an extremely rare event. The only currencies I have seen do the are the Eur/Aud and the gbp/jpy and that has only been in the last 4 weeks. I am sure there have been others but I have not seen them. My experience has been if a currency moves 5-800 pips it usually will have a retracement or two during its run. But the economic news has been so bad that has not happened on certain days. So I came up with the idea of a EA with a range that most currencies would not go beyond. Now the problem is having the funds to survive the margin a 6-800 pip move can do. I know at .01 and with 500 at a 400:1 I can survive a 600 plus move that the GBP/USD did to me the other day. But I would prefer not to face those so I dropped GBP pairs for now. If I can have 4-8 safe currencies then I think I can successfully trade this system. So I post my EA to get every ones advice and comments. I want to know if some sharp guy can punch a hole in the theory. If some of you guys want to get freaked out put 19 pairs on this at .10 and a 50,000 account and .......................................... its damn scary. I wont even post the results they are so wild. When you see the GBP/JPY post a 2500 dollar profit after one of its 1000 point moves you will see what I mean. But then if it doesnt retrace................. bye bye account.

nanningbob , since u got IBFXMini, i have a question for u. Which leverage (IBFXMini 1:200 / 1:400) is best for this system ? Naturally i would think that higher leverage is better. But i read this from IBFX website. For accounts with 400:1 leverage, whenever account equity drops below 125% of the minimum margin requirement, additional trades cannot be placed. Whenever the account equity drops below 100% of the minimum margin requirement, all open positions are subject to liquidation at the prevailing market prices (Margin Call). So which one will u advice ? 1:200 or 1:400 leverage ? Thnx

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Since I am using pennies the 400:1 works best. I wouldnt recommend it for regular trading, you can clean out an account quickly with too large of lots on a small amount of funds.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thnx. Is there a way to calculate how much fund is needed to support the lot size and the number of currency pairs been used for trading ? Maybe this optimize lot size could be used as part of the system to max profit and not blow up the account. Example, $500 could support 0.01 lot trading 10 currency pair which range from 200 - 400. $500 could support 0.02 lot trading 8 currency pair which range from 200 - 400. (Above is just an example and based on gut feel) Since ur Math is way better than mine, maybe u can come up with a formular ? Thnx

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Interesting interest rate result. Previously was GBP: 4.5% EUR: 3.75% Now GBP: 3% EUR: 3.25% I think EURUSD might get more volatile OR same volumn as GBPUSD in the coming months ? I think there is relationship between currency interest rate and volatility. Maybe after a few days of observation, we can include GBPUSD as well in our trading. Another thing is EURGBP gonna move even more slowly i guess since the swap now is only 25 points

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Been an interesting morning. Have 40 closed trades at the moment. estimate about 800 pips + with a current 420 pip floating loss. I am using a modified pair list so can't compare it to yesterdays session. I will keep tabs closely &amp; attempt to exit the trades when the float is closer to even (if possible) opened @ 0100 gmt. NZDCHF / EURJPY/ EURUSD / GBPUSD / USDJPY / USDCHF / AUDCAD / AUDCHF

--- 帖子 #96 ---
It is not the number of currencies since many will balance each other out if you have the right mix. It is how far in the hole they will go during the day. The more volatile the currency the more margin you need. With only 500 dollars you cant use any volatile currencies like Eur/jpy, gbp (any), eur/aud etc. I will try to post my 7 year currency facts this weekend and that will help you when choosing currencies.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yup, i agree. I believe it has been a choppy market for many pairs today. At least those that i have traded. Very slow earning for me today but manage to close with a small positive profit before US session. I don't wanna keep for US session becoz of EUR and GBP interest rate decision.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
This is a good balanced mix. Keep an eye on the eur/jpy and gbp/usd. They will give you the most problems right now especially the gbp/usd.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
According to my own experience, i pick the following pair for $500 dollars account. 1. EURUSD 2. EURCHF 3. USDCHF 4. USDCAD 5. USDJPY 6. AUDUSD What's the max mini lot i can go ? I was thinking of 0.05 lot. What's in ur mind when u come out with the number ? Maybe can make it into a formula and calculate the lot.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Maybe I learned something today. Early in the morning I could have closed trading today with a -40 pip float. I did not take it at the time and ended up just closing out with a -700 float. Now I did end up approx +700 for the session as well, but I wonder what it would have been earlier. Not to mention just being out for the day 4 hours earlier. I think I'll approach my trading session so that if given the opportunity to close out with very low float loss I will take it provided there is reasonable profit in the bank. (what is reasonable?? good question) If not then let it roll &amp; look to close early in the U.S. session. After all there is always another day right.... I think that is kinda what Bob intended anyways. Exit on one of the retracements to minimize the DD. I'll try to get together a report of this morning &amp; post.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
This is the first friday of the month and end of the week. It is not good to hang onto trades over the weekend and putting your self in a hole. I have all my trades closed out by the start of the USA session every Friday.

Hi Bob I'm using an Alpari account and it won't load charts with an "m" at the end i.e.EURUSDm. Is there any way I can remove the "m" from the chart name or do you have a profiles folder without them please? Many thanks John

Hi Bob Don't worry I found the answer in one of the other posts. Sorry I should have read them all first. System now up and running OK. I'll keep you informed. many thanks John

--- 帖子 #104 ---
nanningbob, I wanted to add 2 more currency pair to my trades but I don't know which one to add. Please advice which 2 pairs should I add in order to make my list more balance. I'm more of a less risky person. My account size will be 500 Thnx.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Pairs: audjpy, gbpusd, usdchf, audusd, eurjpy, usdjpy, eurusd, usdcad. Rest all defaults. Closing everything before NFP typhoon hits me

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Shiva, if you test this system, you will notice that it will profit most from highly volatile hours. The only exception was last Tuesday, the 4th, when most currencies went straight up. Test it in demo during the NFP. You might easily double your account if you start as little as 0.04-0.05 lots! Personally I am using almost 15 pairs and the results are excellent

--- 帖子 #107 ---
....quote: on an account I am testing 19 pairs...on another 24 pairs: Excellent results!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I dont like the USD/CAD because it really only trades in one session. Also when USA Fundamentals are strong it will squash the CAD and it wont retrace. The Aud sometimes will have the same problem but because it has its own session outside the USA session it has a better chance of retracing. When I publish my 7 year currency facts you will be able to determine better currency pair combos.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hey Hermes, its good that you want to test the limits of this EA, but why test conditions that will probably never be used in live? Average non-fulltime traders' accoutns will never be able to handle drawdowns with 24 pairs. YET, what you are doing with 19/24 pairs is of some merit as this will demostrate the EA's resilience. Also, when I had initially used the 12 paits presets attached by NanningBob, my platform froze, I think I may need a pc from alienware for this lol Good luck!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Shiva, actually, I run almost 3 Meta platforms with this system and my system does not freeze at all. As I told you earlier, I am testing thys system and, in my humble opinion, the more pairs you trade, the safer and quicker money you earn. You have only to be careful about the Money Management. With a 0.05 max initial lot, I've had so far only a margin of max 2,000 USD on one platform and of max 1,000 USD on another platform. Be aware: only a major and very unpredictable event can destroy your account with this system. But if this happens, any trading method will be jeopardized. So I try the safe play, and this one is the best method I have ever used so far. Enjoy your trade!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Nice. I don't do so well with my pairs. Now only at break even. My pair just move too slow for good profit. Ur list is high risk high profit i guess. I gonna keep my trades for NFP, since my pairs are slow, what could possibly happen ? Thank you. Hope to read it soon.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I'm sorry I have come in on this thread a bit late but I am tiring to set the 100 x 80EA but I can not find the TP. Regards

If you have trouble with MT4 freezing or slow startups and closes you need to go to your first Log folder and delete all the logs. MT4 logs all your actions every day and after awhile it clogs up the program. So every month or so I go in and delete them all out. Again it is your logs folder. If you have done a lot of backtesting this also clogs up the program. Go to the Tester folder and delete the inside of the history folder and inside the log folder. You will notice your MT4 work much faster, quicker and smoother after you do this.

I will post two pics. The first is my demo of the 100x80, I tended to let this run to see what happens. It was pretty much a wash because I hung in too long most days. I traded these pairs aud/jpy, aud/usd, AUD/CAD, AUD/NZD, CHF/JPY, EUR/CHF, NZD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/JPY, and the eur/usd and gbp/usd. I used .01 lots. You will see in my next pic better results. I used less volatile pairs and a higher lot size. The currencies in caps I also used in my live account. The second is the same system and currencies but I traded live with 500 dollars. I increased it $169.31 a 34% increase. I will take that % any time even though that may not seem like much money. I was conservative with my approach. I took my profits and closed down for the day or closed and reentered the market if I didnt see major news stories. I traded the AUD/CAD, AUD/NZD, CHF/JPY, EUR/CHF, NZD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/JPY I started the week also using the gbp/usd and eur/usd but because of volatility and interest rate change news I dropped them after Tuesday. With the above pairs on Thursday I switched to .05 a trade from .01 I have noticed over the years that the day or two before the NFP report they are very quiet so I felt the risk was worth it. You can see where I took the GBP/USD loss on Monday and then you can see the jump in profits when I switched to .05 for thurs and friday. Of this group of pairs, only the Eur/usd and gbp/usd went beyond 4 levels deep during the week. The other pairs were well within the safe zone. So instead of increasing risk by using more volatile pairs I decide to up the ante with the lots. I will use .05 or more this next week and change the program to go only 4 or 5 levels deep. This way I can reduce my risk and maybe increase my profits. I will be able to make better decisions after I study the data and update my 7 year currency report. The first pic is my demo account the second pic is my live account using the 100/80.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I think if the system were to take the less risky pairs, instead of 100/80 it should change to something smaller since they don't move 100 pips as often. I think EURGBP could be included as well if the system change to trade less risky pairs. I like the idea of trading the less risky pair and increasing the lot size. Hope to see the changes and the 7 years currency facts really soon.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Actually I like trading this way also, but there is so much volatility right now it can be dangerous. However, I really learned how forex really worked by watching price action and results by using 15-19 pairs at once. It is where I got my theories from. Every currency will make a certain move just like any other currency; it just may do it once a year where another will do it once a week or month. After seeing all the possible moves I came up with my theories of trading currency ranges rather than indicators, news, or whatever. I recommend everyone who is serious about trading currency ranges do this and blow up a bunch of demo accounts. You will learn more about forex trading and price action than any book or system. You also will learn more about my 100x80 and its pitfalls and weaknesses this way. What can it really do and what can it take? I once had a currency do a death trade and went over 2500 pips beyond the range of the EA. The other 18 currencies were making so much profit that they actually offset the loss of the one trade. I had a demo account of 3000 and the bad trade went over 8000 in the hole but the other currencies made over 7000 in profit. After 3 weeks I gave up and closed for an 800 dollars loss, but it was fun following it. It proved to me that my theories worked. If I close out a bad trade the other currencies will make up for the loss. Those 3 weeks taught me the value of taking the hit and going on. Try trading 19 currencies and have fun with it. I guarantee you will learn a lot.

Another good night. Showed a gross of just under 1200 pips with a net after close out of 685 pips profit for the session. Ran the ea from 0000 gmt to 1151 gmt. True to form the gbpusd was giving me a hard time (just as Bob mentioned it might) and I closed out when I got the chance on a retracement of the pair. I am looking forward Bob to your report and to fine tuning which pairs will be best suited to this approach. So far over 3 nights (I'm in U.S. central time zone) I have had good returns each night. Basically each evening I have started the EA then gone to bed shortly thereafter. I get up sometime around 5 a.m. (cst) and look things over and so far have been able to close out each session at a nice profit. I have at times manually closed trades that are in profit. If I see a trade with +100's that is nearing its TP area and running out of gas I will look at the chart &amp; decide if I think the trade has probability of hitting TP or if reversal is likely and might close out a trade early. So far about 2 or 3 trades a session have been closed this way. I'm wondering has anyone had a losing session? I do remember Bob saying he ran into a bad session with the GBP , anyone else? here is info from last night. NZDCHF / EURJPY / EURUSD / GBPUSD / USDJPY / USDCHF / AUDCAD / AUDCHF /

Qusestion When at the London open do I close all postions and turn off the expert and wait untail GMT 0 to turn back on the expert? Attached is my 3 day running 24 hours a day, I had computer outages for the missing trades. Barry

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Barry , I think things are in the testing phase at the moment. Bob the originator suggest opening around the Asian open and closing out before U.S. open or at least by noon (1200 EST ) . However the EA has only been in operation for the past week so no one has enough trading days with it to set down many verifiable parameters yet. If you could read all of nanningbobs post and then share what you are doing and results, that would probably be to everyones benefit. Bob does explain why he prefers to close out everything daily so you might want to check it out. But hey as it is a demo (for most) might as well try what you think will work.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thanks Bob, just one question, if i delete the files under the testerhistory and testerfiles, will I lose my tick data?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I dont think so, the folder is blank and downloads whatever currency you want to test. The folder would be like a fresh download waiting for you to test.

On 08 Oct 2008, AUDNZD move about 1000 pips. Looks kind of scary.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Here are my 7 year currency facts update Nov. 9, 2008. I also sorted the information in to several groups so it is easier to study the information. There are 11 columns. Column 1 has the currency pairs Column 2 has the total days of information used. For instance the AUD/CAD has 1845 days. Divide that by 6 gives you 307.5 weeks, divide that by 52 gives you information for the last 8.6 years. The AUD/CHF has 93 days or 15 weeks. It is a new pair for IBFX so the data information is for a very small period of time. Column 3 is the highest day recorded for that pair. The record holder is the eur/aud at 2117 2nd is NZD/USD at 2043 etc. yet the NZD/USD has only gone over 500 pips in one day only twice the other was 1700 something. YIKES try to determine if you want to use that one. Columns 4-11 are how many times a pair went over 200, 250, 300 etc. in one day. If you look there are some empty boxes, that means there were no moves registered in that range. For instance the NZD/USD shows 4 times going over 400 and 2 over 700. What that means is of those 4 moves over 400, 2 went over 700 pips and the other two were between 4-500 pips in one day. The USD/CAD shows 5 moves over 400, 2 were over 600, 1 was between 6-700 and the other more than 700. That would mean the remaning 3 were between 4-500. Hope that is understandable. I then arranged the information according to alphabetical order, highest days ever, according to 250 pips, 400 pips, and 600 pips. For this EA you want to know how many times a currency will go over 600 pips in the last 7 years. You want to stay away from ones that go over the 600 pip range and try to trade ones that dont. Tough decisions are made on NZD/USD which is perfect except for 2 days. The problem with NZD, AUD pairs are those aren't price movements they are sudden spikes. The brokers blame the banks and the banks are silent. GBP/JPY are price movements. So have fun and good luck. The information I gleamed from these sheets is what I use to determine my ranges and philosophy of range trading. It was a nice simple system until the last 3 weeks. Most pairs had never moved more than 3-500 pips until recently, now its a nightmare. The gbp/usd used to be perfect for this systetm with its biggest move being under 500 pips in one day. Now its highest day is 986 and has gone over 500 9 times. Times have changed.

Think thats scary read my 7 year currency facts. NZD/USD is really wild. I make money on the AUD/NZD. I use an EA I designed just for it.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
That EA u are using is similar to this system or a totally different trading logic ? Which currency combo u will be using for the coming Monday onwards ?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
if there is a way to create currency fact which contain the information on currency going 200/300/400 pips without retract for 50/100/150/200 pips, it will be the most importance piece of information for this system.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I changed the range to 600 pips and am using the following currencies: aud/nzd, chf/jpy, eur/chf, eur/usd, usd/jpy, usd/chf. I am also going to trade .05 My thinking is fewer pairs, less range but more lots. I used to have the USD/CHF rated as my 3rd most volatile currency 6 months ago but with all the action it has stayed steady and is one of the very few that have not set new records. Its previous high day is still its previous high day so I have added it to this system. Same thing with the USD/JPY, it has gone just a little higher than before but is staying within its range. I am going to put the Eur/usd back into play. It has stayed in the range of the EA. I almost decided to put the EUR/GBP in but its such a slow currency even in this market but it is setting new records almost every day. Three other currencies that could be put in are the USD/CAD, AUD/USD, and the NZD/USD but those that have followed my previous thread know how much I hate to put major currencies with minor ones. I also considered the EUR/CAD and the AUD/CAD but I am not as familiar with them. I want to test them for a period of time before using them. This is what I am trading live with so I am being conservative, my risk is moving up with the lots from .01 to .05 which I started last Thursday with good results.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
You would have to go eyeball each big day to do that. For instance I looked at one currency which had a 600 pip run in one day over 5 hours. On a 1H chart it looked like it never retraced but if you look at the 5M chart during two of those hours it had a 163 pip retracement and a 122 pip retracement. Depending on your entrances they could have taken profit and definitely would have given you escape routes if you wanted out. To find that kind of information would take hours and hours of research on every currency. The GBP/JPY is great for retracements but the one time it doesnt it kills you. Of the 32 times its gone over 600 pips I can bet you the majority of times there will be 2-4 retracements. That is the most exciting currency to trade and dang if I cant get an EA to work on it all the time. It tantalizes you with weeks of profits but as soon as I go live that is the one time it doesnt retrace. It needs the 100 pips plus the 9 pip spread plus the 80 pip spread of the reentrance. So you could possibly need a 188 retracement to get a profit on it. When you got a currency that can go 1000 pips in one day. HMMMMMMM................. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF FOREX

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Funny, I was just looking at your currency pair results and I decided to use the same pairs that you said you were using, I added in EURCAD though, but decided against eur/gbp. With a few different lot sizes though like with usd/chf I'm using more than eurcad due in part to it's movement. I'm live as well. Edit: What kind of settings do you use for your 600 range on your live account?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
To confirm with you, the setting will be TP 100 Pips 60 ? I think the TP might have to change becoz those exact pairs (without AUDNZD and CHFJPY) u have given, I already tried it last week and the TP doesn't hit often. Most of the time it's only 1 currency hit the TP I wonder why u would choose AUDNZD. Firstly it has 14 pip spread and there is chance of sudden spike again in the future which will easily hit the SL. Btw, what's ur SL setting ?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
It has only done it once in 8 years so that is an acceptable risk besides that was not caused by price movement it was a bank induced spike. My EA does not pick up all the levels on those things so any loss is usually very small. The last one that did that was the CHF/JPY and I made 256 bucks on the spike. When the spike hit my EA entered the trade and then it was profit all the way. 600 SL, in my system SL are only for emergencies, I almost never hit them, I will stop a trade long before they get there. I still use my support/resistance levels when trading. If S2 or R2 is touched I will close on the retrace. If they are broken, I am out. That usually is long before my stop loss. If I break S1/R1 I will sometimes close out the trade going the wrong direction, depends on the currency and reading of the market. I still use my trading smarts with the EA but I dont over guess the system either.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
The setting will be Tp100 Pips 60 SL 600. Correct me If i am wrong. Thnx. Let's Rock &amp; Roll tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Just thinking, I wonder how many of the "Monster" moves had big movement during the U.S. sessions?? As some of us are following Bob's lead and not trading for the most part in that time of day might some of those moves be somewhat negated. Maybe there are some pairs that would be better off not being traded at certain times of the day.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Personally, if i made my target money before US open, i will close it. If i don't, i will keep it open for first 2 hours of US open Max.

You will notice your MT4 work much faster, quicker and smoother after you do this. Go to your charts and remove all of the indicators that you do not need and then go to the indicators that you keep, in the properties box change the number bars to 50 or 100. I think that will do the trick. Barry

I have never had trouble getting the tick chart to come back after deleting these files. However, I use IBFX dowloads and that could change from company to company. Companies are allowed to make changes in the basic programming of MT4 to fit their trading philosophies. So sometimes I will say you can do things with an IBFX MT4 you cant do with other companies MT4.

nanningbob Thanks so much for your wonderfull system... I demo it today and the results are impressive I started this AM and waiting for the NY to close it out and see the result of this BABY.... so far it has locked in 700 pips and still counting..... One question, why cant the EA close all the trades before the begining of the NY as per your exit rules.... or once it reaches a % of profit and close all the trades, it would be awesome if this could be addded into the EA.... CHEERS Fxseer

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Ok nanningbob. Good work.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #141 ---
anyone following the new low risk currency setting for 600 pips range ? Haven't got 1 currency TP yet. I open trades on GMT+0 0:00. Looks kind of slow. I think tomorrow gonna be even worst becoz of US bank holiday nanningbob, any comments on the new setting ?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Yes it is so good seeing a normal market. I am not going to complain.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Also the currencies I chose should be able to run all day. Unless something really drastic happens they have not gone outside the EA even during these crazy times. So be patient and let the day unfold. I plan on letting them run all day unless I see good profit or something happens that convinces me to close, like Israel and Iran fighting or Euro drops interest rates 2 points. For example even though the EA had not taken any TP it did have a 5.00 profit so I took it and restarted so it would have the full 600 pip range for the USA open. These are some of the things I will do sometimes to make sure I don't have problems later. I take my profits if it is a slow day, not every day is a big winner.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
A question for u, will it be better if the TP is change to 80 ? The benefit of using TP 80: (1) Lesser TP allow to free up the margin faster in the case when it goes to higher level. (2) Lesser TP allows the EA to reset itself (highest level TP = close all position[build in feature] ) more easily when it reaches level 2 and above. (3) Lesser TP catch profit for those retrenchment below 100 What's the benefit of using TP 100 VS TP 80 ? Looking forward to learn more of this system from your reply. Thnx

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I was wondering the same about lowering the the take profit level. One other question , I have searched but can not locate any adjustment to bring the range down to 600 pips. I have looked in the ea and there is nothing on the indicator side. maybe I missed something.... and if you are starting with .05 lots what adjustment is needed in the lot progression factor.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Change the EA "pips" to 60 and u have 600 range. Factors remains the same. we are increasing lot becoz those selected currency pairs are low risk and the chance of them going over the range is very unlikely. Therefore, we can risk more lots.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
thanks....

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Nanningbob &amp; forexisfx, Today I tried the EA for the first time, unfortunately none of the target prices have been reached, I started the EA at 00:00GMT and its still running as of now which is 14:30 GMT I traded the "safe 6" pairs suggeted by Nannigbob which I believe forexisfx traded as well, I traded 0.05 lots, other than this I have not made any other changes to the EA. Have you guys had similar results? Should we change the pairs as someone else bagged 700 pips.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Fxseer, What pairs did you trade and what lot size?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
This is a little off the path. With this EA we're buying and selling a pair at the same time. Do you consider this as hedging? I remember last year, my accountant wanted to know if any of my forex trading involved hedging. If this is considered hedging I'll probably have to inform the IRS of this on next years tax return. My question to you is limited to- do you think this is hedging? Thanks

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I dont know the IRS rules on hedging but the EA is just designed to trade both ways. It enters both the buy and sell at the same time so those trades are hedged. It some times can have 2 or 3 levels going at the same time in both directions and the MT4 will hedge them but it was not designed to be a hedging system. However, the program and trading system does take advantage of that feature. So trading both directions causes the hedging to happen, which is a plus for margin usage. Why in the world would the IRS care about whether I trade hedging or not, SHEEEEEEEEEESH?????????

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Actually those features are built into the EA if you want to set them. I use the start up feature on Mondays when the gaps are big so my trades will start later. It has % and dollar amount but I have not played with them that much. I dont use them because the market doesnt do the same thing everyday. You can demo test them and see how they work for you.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
What's the benefit of using TP 100 VS TP 80 ? 10 months ago I came up with a math formula for trading and it has seemed to work very well throughout the year. I tried different formulas and this seemed to work best. If you move your TP to 80 then the reentry levels should be 20% or the TP. So 20% of 100 is 80 reentry. The reentry for 80 then would be 64. 64 x 10 levels gives the EA a range of 640. If you want to trade lower risk you go 8 levels or 512 range EA. If you have lots of funds you can go 15 levels. I am not willing to risk those kind of funds. Reward versus risk ratios. That is the mathematical formula I use for 2.0 multiplication. If you ever follow my other thread, I have a 100x40 and a 50x20. They use a multiplication of 1.5 so the reentry is 40% of the TP. These formulas are based on risk versus reward ratios. In some of my demos now I use 1.2 and 1.3 mutiplication and 20-30 levels. The math can get really wild at times. These are some of my experiments. My most successful EA ever has been the 100x40 but the market has changed, it no longer trades in the 3-400 pip range that EA uses. Some people are still successful with it but are staying out of the USA session. I decided to adjust to the market hence the 100x80. Why 100 TP versus 80 TP? I wanted an 800 pip range EA thats why, this market is so volatile right now I believe that is what it takes to trade the market with a system like this. Even then the GBP/USD took it too its limit several times in the last week. Patience in trading is a virtue, if you dont have it you will lose money. There are gong to be days this EA will not make much money. Yesterday was an example. I made 5 bucks

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I knew i am missing something. Thank you for the explanation. Will stick to 100X60

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Indicator list for the - metatrader 4 -, good trading!!!!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
To change the range of the EA is to change the levels from 10 to 8 or ???. Now you have lowered your risk and range. 800 to 640. To increase profitability you lower your reentry levels or increase your lot size but you increase your risk. To reduce the chances of a death trade you increase your reentry levels but you also exponentially increase the amount of debt when you do have one. The more levels the bigger chance you have of wiping out your account when you do get one. I like using level 8 because it only takes 1-2 days on average to recover from the loss.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
What's ur setting for the 600 range currency ?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I just went to 8 levels and decreased my risk. 8 x 80 = 640

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thank you very much for your interesting EA. im runnig it on 3 different platforms. By accident i run EA on Alpari UK with original setting. Now Alpari has 5 decimal digits which means i had to change TP from 100 to 1000 and re-entry from 80 to 800. i did not know that and got 10pips TP. As a result I closed my EA at 8am EST with almost $2000.00 profit. Pairs EURCHF EURJPY EURUSD GBPUSD AUDJPY USDCHF AUDCAD AUDCHF

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I am learning the hard way. I ran your set of pairs and when no trades took place for long time, I ran it well into the NY session and I am still nursing some DD. Though on a micro live account, it helps me to learn faster! First thing I have learnt is, constant monitoring really helps to keep tab on things. I have also observed that EURUSD an CHFJPY are mainly driving this set of pairs in terms of pips and movement and the stability provided by other pairs is somewhat negated. It is still possible to play around with pairs. I want to know how important is multiplication? Is it ok to keep it 1.0 or will affect performance over a period of time? Anyway I am reading the other thread for all the vital information, but there is so much to digest. Thanks again for everything..

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Very interesting..Somewhere this crossed my mind but scary proposition this 10 X 8 EA!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I tried a 15x5 once and made good money then WHAM big market move and account cleaned out. I had pulled my origianal money out so i didnt lose money but it was disappointing. Used the eur/jpy of all things. Yesterday and today good days for that but one big move and it blows up on you. Trade currencies in their off hours and these type of EAs work but you ahve to be there. I cannot since I am at work 10 hours a day. I am experimenting with an ea of a range of 200 but trading in off hours. Working so far.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
how do i get the ea's to start working? ive loaded the profile and everything? they are greyed out?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
whitegoodman , nice avatar

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hello Bob. When I set up a 10K standard account and clicked on the profiles folder, the daily charts populated with "m" after the pairs. Do you have a different setup that would allow a standard account starting with .01 lots? Thank you for sharing your work and I look forward to testing with the rest of the members. PC

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Haha, well if that is the way you want to trade then it seems to be working. Very high risk in my book though, you really open yourself up to any major price drop/gain and the effects are felt immediantly. If I was trading this way live I'd be even quicker to take out my funds once my account was doubled, hehe.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Right click on the grey part, click on modify, this will open up the editor, On the top there is a button that says compile, click on compile and that should compile the program. That should work. If not hmmmmm.............

--- 帖子 #169 ---
A standard account should run trading dimes instead of pennies. The profile was set as a m for micro. You can set up your charts and just drag the EA onto it. It should work. Set up under a different profile. If you have problems write back and I will set up a different profile for you.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
If we keep multiplication factor at 1.0, will it adversely affect the profitability of the system? If fractional lots like 0.12 etc.are not allowed with my broker, what is the way out?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
dont worry about it im an idiot, didnt have expert advisor clicked on at the top. But in turn i have another issue, alot of the charts dont have the 825 pip stop loss and dont really look like the charts you posted earlier on, for example, some have two green lines, some only have 1 heaps 'far away' red line instead of the two, some have no 'far away' red lines... im probably not explaining myself well, ill post some screenshots tonight when i get home from work, ive left the system on all day on my demo, should be interesting to see when i get home... its probably meant to be this way, im jsut a novice and new to mt4 and forex in general...be kind to us young forexers

--- 帖子 #172 ---
At 1x you would always been trading the same amount of lots 1x1=1 haha. So... if you were at levels like 3-4+ then you would be taking big losses.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Is either x1 or 1.5x or x2 for u. However, x1 makes no sense at all.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Got you, Thanks.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
yes it will affect it. No profitablilty. 1x1=1x1=1x1=1

--- 帖子 #176 ---
i kept the EAs running since 6 Nov 08 and here's the result; when the lot reach its max, it resets to 0.01; floating loss now is -$65, profit $421; i supposed it will blow up one day??

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thank you for your patient replies all along. After running this EA whole day with various pairs and setting on many platform, now I am beginning to understand how it works. I would like to go live with a $300 IBFX mini account, but scared after seeing the no of lots open at times, I am really scared. Now I am experimenting 12 x 8 EA on all JPY pairs expecting total mayhem. Surprisingly it is chugging along beautifully churning out profits like mad. I don't know how long it will last! It reaches all 10 levels and nice to see 25.60 lots open at a time for 12pips!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
That just scares me, haha.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Which pairs are you using? What is the maximum loss you came across any time during this run?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
how do you set a lot or profit max so it resets?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I run all the pairs mentioned in first post; during the run the max floating loss was -$110 but then it turned around

--- 帖子 #182 ---
i used the original setting ie multiply is 2.0 and maxtrade=10; so the EA basically increased the lot size up to MaxTrade and then go back to the original 0.01

--- 帖子 #183 ---
nanningbob, I have an idea that might be a "good to have" for the EA. I believe there are some people who babysit the EA and sometimes close the position manually. Most of the time we do that is becoz the level is getting too high and wanted to get out as soon as possible without any loss or small profit. There is time where too many position are open and it takes time to find out which level each currency pair is in. It will be good to have for each order under comments, the level of the position. Example, the comments for order can be like this: "AUDNZD Sell level 1" "AUDNZD Sell level 2" "AUDNZD Buy level 1"

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I made this little spread sheet to help folks (mostly me) very quickly and easily do the math and see what the changes are when you adjust the multiplier, take profit, pip spread, and max trades. I hope this helps. PS. 'Coverage' shows you what the settings will handle, for example in the picture below, it will handle a 320 pip spread with no problems (this is the old standard 100x40 settings). The 'Total' is the gross 'profit', the sum of each lot. This is not necessarily in USD, it all depends on the currency. Regardless, I think that it's good to keep it around 25-30. EDIT- OK, updated with Max Draw Down, showing what it would look like if the EA was maxed out and you were at the point where the EA would enter a new trade, only it's already past your Max Trades.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
NanningBob, take a look at this. Something interesting happens with the below settings, your reward is greater than the risk (4:3) Max Draw Down is in absolute value to make things easier.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Nice work and it looks very interesting.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I dont know if 300 is enough. I started at 500 and took a hit the first day. Since then I am doing fine and closing in on 700 dollars. You can do 300 dollars as long as you dont take a hit right off the bat. My goal was always to develop an EA so guys with 3-500 bucks could do this. If you go with the non risky pairs you should be fine but they are really slow this week. Bad news for the profit line but good news in that the markets maybe heading back to more normal runs. So the less risky pairs and 300 should do it for you at 400:1 I went ahead on one of my demos to go 20 pairs to see how it would do. NO eur/aud though Let you know how it goes. For my 8 slowest pairs, I think a turtle could go faster but sometime security of capital is more important than trading. I am going to open things up a little more next week if things look like they are finally settling down.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Now that is cool. I have been doing things by hand and that takes a while.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi folks. Just wanted to post my results for a few days. EA made over 1% just using .01 lots on a mini account. Thanks Bob for your interesting approach to trading this market. How's your live account doing?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
But when you change the 80 to 20 you also change the range of the EA from 800 pips to 200 pips. Now you can get killed in a matter of hours. You change the TP to 25 to stay within the math formula and this is the odds you are playing. You are playing that price will retrace 25 pips plus max 19 from last reentry plus spread every 200 pips. That is what I call a high risk scenario. The chances of a currency beating that in one day is pretty high. The chances of a currency beating 800 pips in one day is very very low. Now could you trade such a scenario. Yes but never in the USA session. You would go from 1 H after USA session close to 2-4 hours into the EUR session and you probably would do well with the lower currencies. Why????? You guessed it I am demoing right now that type of trading system. Hey Frosty you are starting to think like me. That could be dangerous you know.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
My live account is snailing along this week using the 100x80. I am live with IBFX and doing well there though using a different EA. Between the 2 accounts and 2 different EAs I am making 60-120 a day. I moved up to 39 th place after being in the 600's after my first day. I took a hit with the GBP/USD the first day. Some crazy guy has 10 times his account but I also know they can disappear in the contest just as fast. I hope to crack the top ten this time but I cant take another hit and do that. My philosophy is to always trade small, use multiple currencies, EAs and use several accounts. This way if one or two trades go bad the overall picture is to never take the big hit. I am amazed that in the financial world they teach to diversify your portfolio for best overall results but here in the forex world it is bet it all on one currency and trading system. The greats are guys who trade 10-50 lots and try to get 10-20 pip profit. Egads ........... what a potential disaster. The first guy who trained me taught me to trade the news. If I had kept trading like that I would be dead right now. My heart couldnt take watching 5 lots going 100 in the hole in 30 seconds. How do guys trade like that and live to be 55 anyway? Then I did the indicator thing, and the support and resistance thing, and the that and this thing. My conclusion was this: price does only 2 things it goes up and then it goes down and then it goes up again. Whatever that range is have an EA that covers a bigger range and then I dont care what price does, an indicator does, etc, etc, etc,. I realize I may not be right and all this is foolishness (I hope not) but dang I think trading a currencies price range is the best way to go.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Have you been running throughout the week or do you open at early Asian session and close out beginning of US session?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I usually close before the USA session but not always. Monday and Tuesday are usually slow days so you can run them. I mean the EA has an 800 pip range so it should handle almost anything. The real reason I close at USA session is I only am using 500 dollars so I dont have that much margin to play with. If I used 2000 I could use more volatile pairs and wait trades out for several days. So funds is what keep me very conservative. Also I have only been using this EA for around 3 weeks so it is basically untested. After I understand it more and see it move more then I can make decisions on how I want to use it. Preservation of capital is very important in these systems.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I failed to mention, I'm trying to work out about 4-5 different settings for different currencies. Each setting would attempt to cover 80% of days on each specified pair. So, a 200 spread setting would only work on a very few pairs. I wrote the spread sheet because I was getting too lazy to do things by hand all the time. Same reason I'm looking for various settings along with the other things I mention elsewhere; I'm actually quite lazy. And yes, I'm starting to think a lot like you, but that's OK, we both have the same goal $$

--- 帖子 #195 ---
When you get a chance send me an email. I think you might understand some concepts I have but I need someone to try them. I dont want happened to this thread that happened to the other one. We ended up talking about 5 different EAs and confusing the heck out of everyone.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
i have notice that once in a while the EA opens 2 position of the same pair with the lot size. I have notice this a few times now. does this happen to any of u?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
You xls sheet is very useful, Thanks. You study mentioned above will be very nice. Please tell us if you come across any interesting combination of Currency + EA setting +Trade Time. There are so may variables involved, it becomes difficult to keep tab. As nanningbob has revealed, there is nothing much can be done with $300 -$500 account, I will have to curb my gambling instinct and be happy playing demos.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
NanningBob is right, use the tool, it's very helpful, but lets keep this thread on the 100x80 topic so as not to make things confusing

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi FrostCall - I appreciate your sentiment.... but just need to highlight the fact that the spreadsheet uses 'roundup' to calculate the incremental lot sizes, where in fact it should be simply 'round'. I really appreciate your creating this sheet, as in fact I had just asked Bob on the other thread for just such a thing..... many thanks, Jim

I have been testing this EA for the last 3 days... opening before the Japan market and closing it before the New york market... and this has been the results so far... http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/j...mentfxseer.jpg

--- 帖子 #202 ---
EA based on 1st post ( all pairs ) running since 6 Nov 08 with equity $3K; now profit $769 with Floating-$68; highest floating loss -$1200

--- 帖子 #203 ---
thats a pretty hefty drawdown? you starting off with how much? 0.10?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
i started off with 0.01 lots but usdcad last night went up to the max level with the largest lot at 5.12 but good thing it turned around

--- 帖子 #205 ---
My platform is showing no S/L as well. Is it hidden from the broker in the EA?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I do not recommend the USD/CAD, the dollar can squash it and there will be no retrace. Count yourself lucky and delete it. Bob

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I deleted my previous post. I got them to work on my Demo with the stop losses going both ways. Here is my .01 buy/sell EAs with 10 levels and 825 SL and my .02 buy/sell EAs with 9 levels and 800 SL. I hope this works for every one.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
also can we jsut have one chart per currency or is there a reason for having a black background one and a white background one? the same info seems to be represented on both? thanks for any help, slowly understanding this system, btw testing is going well... started with $500 demo account... I open it before i got to work, which is 7.30am in Sydney so start of sydney session and then close it before i go to bed an hour before US session.... in 2 days its up 8.5% using the currency combos suggested in the first post.. and i think the most in levels it went to was the 3rd i think (0.04 lots...)

--- 帖子 #209 ---
It is impossible to run two EAs on one chart white. That is why there are two charts for each pair.. the buy chart and the sell chart.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Ever wonder what making 900 dollars in one day looks like. I ran my EA on 20 currencies at .10 lots just to see what would happen. Yikes. This EA was designed to survive days like this and it did. Even the Eur/Gbp set a record yesterday moving 320 points. Is nothing sacred anymore.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Here I was happy with my 30$ on my A/N... hehe realtivly low risk for the reward.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Bob, Thank you for all the work you are doing and the great learning experience. Is this the new/latest EA you are testing? The latest I thought you were testing 8 levels at 80 pips with a lot size of .05. Has that changed to this latest EA? What pairs &amp; lot size are you testing? My results so far have been great. My biggest drawdowns and losses occur during the US session. Today's US session was terrible! At around trade #215, I changed from .01 to .05 lots.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
funny... I only see lots of 0.01 - 0.02 - 0.04 nothing beyond that... I like to start a live account with this system, according to what I have read so far, we can start with a $300 - $500 account is that correct? Please correct me, if i'm wrong... Cheers

--- 帖子 #214 ---
oh i see... dont worry plenty more stupid questions will be asked... thanks

--- 帖子 #215 ---
yeh same here, better that way tho, less drawdown i feel im quite fortunate in terms of my work and uni schedule that i turn it on when i wake up and turn it off when i go to bed. Means i miss the US session and what may be the biggest chance of a hefty drawdown

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I've been following this with curiosity and just downloaded the templates and EAs. Put them on 20 charts....10 buys and 10 sells. Only the BUYS open. Is there something wrong with the sell EA? On IBFX demo account.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
If you know how to modify the program you can go in and change thelots size.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
go back to post 209 and get the updates. Evidently I made a mistake in the original post.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
To do a buy and a sell EA so they can do both at one time takes different magic numbers. Magic numbers are assigned to each set of trades so the EA and the banks can differentiate them. I have one account with 4 charts trading the same currency but I am using different EAs. Each chart needs a separate Magic number so the orders do not get confused. Ask lots of stupid questions, when you know the answers people think you are smart and know something.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
oh i see, btw for the close all script (so i dont have to manually close each trade at the end of the day ... which file/place to i put that mq4?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
HAHAHA!!! I spoke too soon... about not seeing any other size lots apart from 0.01 and 0.02, today after work check my open trades and to my amazed there was 3 trades of 0.08 and 6 trades of 0.04 wow that makes a lot of a difference with the $$$ on your DD... Is it possible just to have lots of 0.01 and lots of 0.02 to start with till i have a health equity size... can someone plz tell me what i need to change in the EA to enable only trades of 0.01 and 0.02... Thanks Fxseer

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Nanningbob, the EAs I loaded were from post 209. The buy EA has a magic number, and the sell EA has a separate magic number. After two hours now, no sells have opened on the sell EA from post 209.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
to my knowledge you wouldnt wanna do that cos that would reduce the effectiveness as it is semi martingale, meaning it needs to keep going up... (correct me if im wrong) i think what bob is trying to suggest, is to recognise the death trades so these levels are allowable but when it starts getting to higher levels you know when to turn off the ea and exit. But im pretty sure if your money management is alright then even if it goes to max 8 levels you should still not be dead in the water so to speak

--- 帖子 #224 ---
well the one on the first page works fine except some people like me dont have a sell stop loss... maby we could jsut manually change it?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I noticed the same thing with the sell ea from post 209. No sells open with the version .01 ea I used the .02 version for the sells &amp; changed the lot size to 0.01 to match the version .01 buy ea. I guess that is all that is different.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Dang I dont know what to say I took them off of my EA and they are working here. Well let me look again. SORRY

--- 帖子 #227 ---
http://i271.photobucket.com/albums/j...entfxseer2.jpg Just closed the EA.... today made an unbelievable profit...up by $1200 Any suggestions which currencies and how many I can run with an account $300 or $500 Thanks for your input...

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I am also curious to know. meanwhile I am running just AUDNZD on a small live account and performance has been satisfactory so far. Because of account limitations, I have manage with 6-8 levels only and it needs constant monitoring. nanningbob, When we see a trend emerging in a single pair is it ok to use only BUY or SELL EA ? Can we switch on and off either of them?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi, Going to be a bit off topic here. Some post back bob was saying if you could stay close ot the PC 1 could try 30 x 10 on AUD/NZD. Tired it for a day (today) for 5 hrs. It alone is already 100 profit. Very interesting to see how it moves. I did both a buy and sell on 30 x 10. and starting lot size is 0.10 It went 5 levels deep and about $60 DD

--- 帖子 #230 ---
On the other thread where we learned all these things we are using here that is what we did. I used a 100x40. It ran great for 9-10 months but when we hit these volatile markets we had problems staying within the 400 pip range of the EA. I was using it yesterday and the eur/chf (of all things) went beyond its range. I could try to use the same formula with the 100x80 and do that. We also tried using a 4 H chart to determine direction and had some success but it works best using a 1Day chart. But to answer your question Yes you could use whatever indicators you like to use and just turn on the buy or sell, when you think its a good time. For instance you could put a MA cross in the program like when the 1MA median crosses the 7MA on a 1H chart and it will enter in the direction you want to go automatically. So if you are in a downtrend and price retraces you could just put the sell on and when the downtrend continues it will enter and profit for you. If you dont get the entrance right it will protect you and enter on several levels before continueing on the trend. I did this for a period of time but I am not home very much to watch the EA so I prefer range trading. I dont have to be home to make my entrances. I have never tried this method with the 100x80 but I did use it with some success with a 50x20

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I deleted the .01 EA, and put on the .02 EA, and changed the trade amount to .01, and it now works. Very strange. But, all is well now. Looking forward to testing this thing on 10 pairs.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Thanks for your input. I am trading LIVE only this, as suggested by nanningbob due to limited funds. I am tweaking here and there and I feel safe somewhat. If you come across any good particular setting, please let me know. I am sure this EA can be indeed someone's Holy Grail! In fact I am trying JPY pairs on a demo and the results are very very good so far. This is off topic, but I can never afford to go live live with 100x80EA with 10levels deep. I will have to manage with minimum pairs and resonable profits (or losses)

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I am thinking of starting a seperate thread for that one but I want to test it a little while longer before I make it public. You are on the right track though, I am working with some different numbers but you are close. A 30 x10 is workable but with some different math.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
sounds cool, my dream is to have a few different EA's/accounts going to diversify and spread the losses... just as an example.... -100 x 80 with 'safer currencies' -100 x 80 with agressive currencies - 100 x 40 with safe curencies - 30 x 10 etc etc so youve diversified with currencies and tp settings over multiple accounts, and then have my personal manual trading account... im a bit of a dreamer tho, but with Bob's good work and consistent brainstorming and testing anything may be possible... also does it matter what timeframe you have your chart on eg daily or 4hour and does it matter like when you turn your EA on? (as in indicators, support/resistance etc)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I though of that too.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
So far so good, EA running since 6Nov08; Profit $1107; Floating Loss-$26.97

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Very nice result for the week. The EA produced +3% on a 10K account starting with .01 lots.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I ran the safe 7 with 0.05 lots 24 hours on a 500 demo account, it went the full 10 levels on the chf pair, anyway the 24 hour thing didn't reaklly work out neither did the 500 dollar deposit, I ran out of margin and most trades were automatically closed. I have to start again. Well 24 hours probably won't work even with the slowest moving pairs unless we babysit and close losing trades. Its best to stick to asia session to US session start I suppose.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
i think thats way too much lot size to account size even if its 'safe' pairs

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Which EA are you using exactly, and what are your current settings?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
To everyone posting returns &amp; graphs, it is nice to see your returns however, without specifics of what EA you are using and your settings used and pairs traded the info is of no real value. Sharing details of your setup will help in the development process.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I agree, Tommy. Everyone trading different pairs. Some trading 10, some trading 8, some trading 6, and some trading .01, and some trading .02. Would be helpful to know. Speaking of which, how do I make that graph everyone posts?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Nannigbob, how much would an account lose trading in .01 if things went very bad? Would it be $500.00? $1,000.00 or ? Reason I ask is that there's an EA that one can use to close all trades at a certain account loss. If I wanted to go live with a two or four thousand dollar account, what would be the worst that could happen? Could I protect against the worst case scenario with a EA that would close out at X dollars loss? Since the worst rarely happens, and in normal times the EA would make 2-5% a week, if I knew what the worst was in dollars, I could protect my account. By the way, 2-5% of what? Of an account size of $300.00, $500.00, $3,000.00? I hope my questions make sense. VERY impressed with your system and EA

--- 帖子 #244 ---
That graph is produced from the MT4 Terminal function. Open the "Account History" tab along the bottom and then Right Click anywhere in the history page. Choose "Custom Period" in the menu that pops up then choose "Today" There should then only be trades from today displayed. Right click that page &amp; choose "Detailed Report". save to your desktop or wherever you choose. I have tried to post the whole report but it doesn't format correctly to attach to the forum for some reason.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Well I assumed as there wasn't very much movement in the said pairs increasing the lot size might boost returns. I think you're correct. So far I've concluded in order to survive its best to trade small lots of 0.01 to 0.02 with a carefully selected pairs and start with adequate capital, atleast 2000usd. Lots of people are posting equity curves but its very important to also mention the max unrealized aka floating drawdown they experienced as this may suddenly use up all of your equity as losses mount. It also maybe a good idea to manually close trades which are losing a significant amount of money rather than hope and wait for the currency to revert to the mean. Well these are just my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
That is probarly the single, most important thing anyone can learn with this system/ea. I use to just hope and pray things would turn around... sometimes they would, sometimes.... not so much. Every since I started just taking the hit on my account I've been able to make it all back within the same day 90% of the time.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Yes, excellent understanding of the system.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
ok so what pairs are everyone using?? i was using the original ea with the original profile. are yall just using 10 pairs now and version .02 w/ .01 lots??? if just 10 pairs what pairs did yall delete? what ea are yall using?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I started trading 20 pairs on Wed. and changed to .10 lots. I am not using the Eur/Aud that pair is too volatile for this EA but the others have stayed in range. The results have been quite wild. Trying to see how much I can push this EA. Someone asked earlier if we hit the stop loss how much would it be. I estimated it would be in the 5-600 range. The truth is I stop them out before I get there. I only put that in for emergencies. Even though I have had some trades push the EA near its limit, no currency has stopped it out yet. I am going to continue doing the 20 pair thing and try to find out what it would take to wipe out the account. What scenario would happen to do that. The drop at the end was my closing on Friday night. The account was not in trouble but I dont hold trades over the weekend. Before I switched to the 20 pairs you can see the very slow rise from trading the 8 recommended pairs earlier. I am going to try trading .02 on 300 dollars and see what happens. Can you trade this system with a small amount of money. We will see.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Bob, Would it be possible to add a global TP &amp; SL to the EA on a percentage basis that we could enable and disable? The idea behind this is that we can control or risk up front. Thanks, PC

--- 帖子 #251 ---
You can go inside the program and change it to whatever you want.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
hmmm bit of a side question here.... say i turn on the exert advisor to keep it going all day does my computer and mt4 have to be on all day? (or does it keep going until i finally turn the expert advisor off and close out all trades) and say im running the 2 accounts will the EA's keep working in the account im not logged into? mt4 novice as you can see.... btw Bob what were the 20pairs you were running?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
thanks for your quick response and for starting this thread. its has been doing good for me this past week using the original from post #1 so you are using 20 pairs sounds great!! if it isn't too much to ask..... what are the 20. sorry and thanks!!

--- 帖子 #254 ---
u must leave computer and mt4 on while ea is running if not on then ea is NOT working!!!! as far as 2 accounts go. I have 3 seperate platforms running all the time with 3 different ea's. that way there is no possible interference. try that that way you can be logged into as many accounts as you want all at the same time.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
hmmm thats a little dissapointing cos id want to turn it on when i wake up in the morning, then monitor it at work with my laptop, problem is to and from work it wont be on..... unless i can leave my home computer on all day (no problem) and monitor it at work with my laptop??? how do you get 3 ibfx platforms?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Well... You could always install MT4 on both your laptop and your regular computer. Leave MT4 with the ea running on your desktop then whenever u wanna check on it u can login to your account from your laptop with mt4. More than one user can login to a mt4 account. You can create more than one ibfx platform fairly easily... you just install it to a different directory. Like Interbankfx4... interbankfx3... etc. It gives you the option of installing it to different directories like any other installation of an application. You could always just Copy the Interbank folder and then just rename it. You just go in and create a shortcut from the terminal.exe and you are good to go. Hope you are able to figure it out white.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
perfectly explained and problem 100% solved, you sir are a gem

--- 帖子 #258 ---
You can use a remote host that runs VMware that way you dont have to be logged in or you can use logmein and log in from work to mointor your trades but in this case you'll have to keep your home computer running.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
that sounds confusing, so the ea keeps running even tho the home comp isnt on? ill jsut keep my home comp on i think.... just hope there isnt a black-out.. thanks for the help ill take this to pm, dont wanna get off topic, back onto 100 x 80 EA discussion

--- 帖子 #260 ---
You basically pay a company that runs your software on their server 24/7 and you can login to the server like as if it were a website. They are more reliable, but everywhere I would trust to run an EA on a server charges monthly.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I finally got to play around with this. What a great addition to the forum. Thanks. I will be playing with this all weekend. To some of you who want to play with only 300 bucks, the answer is on the way.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
whitegoodman, first thing you need is to go buy a emergency power back up. I did a couple of weeks ago. I had just placed a trade and 60 seconds later bingo a power black out. It did not last long, 2 minutes, but that was long enough for me... I went that day and bought a $45 APC Ups ES 550 good on my system for about 38 minutes. (useful software come with it as well) (I can also close out trades on my phone with MT4 mobile) Oh and one more thing. DISABLE Windows Automatic Update as this will cause your computer to re boot sometimes after it has installed updates. just set it to notify you of updates but NOT install them automatically. Its not fun to wake up and be greeted by the login screen instead of the MT4 screen you left running in a position.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
that may prove a cheaper option then getting a company to host it on there server, btw verto how much would that set you back? yeh i need to get a new mobile that can have mt4 for emergencies i think.... xmas is around the corner will be interesting to see what you come up with Bob, ive been trying to play around with it but dont really understand it as of yet....

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Nanningbob, I asked some questions earlier that I think you missed. I know you're busy. I'llk condense the question. If I were to go .01 on 8 or 10 pairs, what is the most I could potentially lose if things went bad? Would it be something like $500.00 or ? If I went live with a $3,000.00 account at .01, I'd like to know the probable biggest hit I could take. That way, I can plan on that, and even set the EA to close out at a loss of a little more than that. This way, I know what I'd be risking for the probable gain on a weekly basis that going .01 would give me. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Ok getting extra platforms is easy! just go and download like you did the first time once you get to the area where it asks what name you want it under (normally says IBFX MetaTrader 4) you can simply type a new name or add the #2 or somthing so you know which is which then you will click next till you get the 2nd platform up go yo start menu on computer and you should see 2 platforms If you go to click on your Icon on your Desktop it may pull up the new MT4 instead of the old one...if so simply go to your start menu find your original MT4 find the icon and create a shortcut (rename one of your MT4 shortuts so you know the difference). hope this helps

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I am sorry if I missed your post. I try to answer everyones questions if I can. So please accept my apologies. It will differ from currency to currency but it will be in the 800 dollar range if you use 9 levels. 400 dollars if you use 8 levels. You then subtract profits already made for the difference. You really want to use currencies that wont take it that deep. The probabilities: in 7 years of information there are only 14 currencies that have ever gone over 700 pips in one day. If you check my 7 year currency fact sheet you will see which currencies have gone over 700. Of the 20 currencies only 63 times have they gone over 700 points in one day. The gbp/jpy and the eur/aud account for 35 of them or over half. Add to that the Aud/jpy 7, eur/jpy 5, gbp/chf 5, aud/chf 2, plus 35 from gbp/jpy and eur/aud equals 57 of the 63 times. So of 20 pairs listed you eliminate 6 of them and you have 6 times in 7 years for the remaining 14 pairs. So you check the remaining pairs to see which ones will work for you. I do not recommend the USD/CAD because the USD will squash it at times and it wont retrace for days. The rest of the pairs you dont have to worry about them breaking 800 points without a retracement because it takes over 1 day to do. If you restart at a good spot every day you never face the death trade from them. The other thing is, the only pair that ever ran more than 800 points without a major retracement was the EUR/AUD that I have seen. The NZD/USD has done 2 spikes of over 1500 pips in 1M periods. The gbp/jpy will move over 700 rather frequently (about every 2 months average) but there is always a major retracement during the run to get you out of trouble. I have never seen it run without a retracement or two during the run. So the odds are really, really rare. The only time I ever ran the gbp/usd on this EA live was the day it ran 900+ points and I took a loss on it. Shows you my luck. I have attached the raw data for each currency so you can go back to all the big move days and research them for yourself how price moved on those days. You can use the 1 H chart to get a good idea how price moved.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Last I week I bought APC UPS 1000VA with extra battery pack paying $250! We are really serious about this EA aren't we?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I am waiting..

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Good advice. I rename them the same so I put demo 1, demo 2, etc. then I rename the short cut demo 1, demo 2, etc. My live accounts I use my account # so I know which one I am trading and adding EAs and indicators to.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I think the average price is probarly in the 20$-40$ a month range. I haven't done much research on the subject because, so far, I have had very reliable service with my power and network.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Its gonna be a while I am testing for one more week before I publish to make sure. I am still playing with some of the math and testing it live.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Bob, In your reply to paradoxical you mentioned "Starting in a good spot" talking about turning on the EA. What in general are you looking for to open the EA? I know you want to open around the Asian open but what "Other" considerations are you looking for as well?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I also look to see if price is somewhere near the pivot line for the day. If it is way out I will wait on it. I should say I prefer to be between S1 and R1. With a 100x80 EA that is not so critical as my other EAs but it is still good advice. I also look for Trichet or Bernanke speaking . They seem to move the Forex market more than any other factor. I have traded days and seen no major news stories and one of these guys will make an off the cuff remark and the market just go nuts all of a sudden. As one broker once said, "I wish those two would just SHUT UP!"

--- 帖子 #274 ---
bob thanks for that, i don't know why i didn't just do that anyway. makes too much since. anyway, that helps a lot. gonna open up several accounts and change things around a bit to see what works the best. will start sunday and let everyone know my personal results friday. if more people would be willing to do this, i think we could see the ups and downs of this ea more clearly thanks again for all your hard work and for answering the questions!!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Bob, Thanks for that detailed reply. That's what I needed to know. I'll use 8 pairs and pick the safest ones from your list. I realize that the more pairs I add, the more of a potential loss I could suffer. $800.00 for 9 versus $400.00 for 8, and I imagine if I used 10 pairs, it might be an exposure of about $1,600.00 or more, and all this trading at just .01 Now, all I need do is test 8 pairs and see what the return per week in dollars is. That will give me the risk to reward I'm looking for. For instance, if going .01 using 8 pairs returns an average of $150.00 a week, to me that's a fantastic return versus the risk of a rare loss of $400.00. Plus, I saw a post where your EA even has a setting for a global stop that I can employ to stop out after a loss of more than $400.00 Looking forward to testing this great system and ea some more.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Actually my personal feeling is the more currencies I trade the better it is because the others will bank profits while one is going bad. 8 pairs is a good start though. Again it is just playing the odds, what are the chances of going over 800 pips in one day. I think if you pick the right pairs the odds are very very small.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
lacking retrace atm, fair bit of drawdown on all 3 demo strategies... still 4 hours till i close shop for the night...we shall see

--- 帖子 #278 ---
yep same here just opened one at start of us to see how it does. the ones open since yesterday are all in negative but still have plenty time to turn around. I will post results of my 4 different tests on Friday

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I am running dime lots just to see what happens and it is very interesting. As the market moves in one direction the profits are just a couple of hundred dollars from the deficit. I am running just over 700 dollars in the hole but my take proft is at 500. So my running deficit is at 200 +, If the market ever reverses I will make a killing, if it doesnt my losses wont be so bad for playing .10 lots. I am running the 20 pairs. I will keep you informed but it is looking more and more that the best way to run this is to run many pairs not just a few. I am doing much better this way.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Bob, my concern was the spread on some of those other pairs at 12 pips. That's not much of a factor that you can see?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I'm testing 8 pairs at .01, and am at pretty much breakeven starting from the open on Sunday evening. On another demo account, testing 6 pairs at .05, and down about 2%. The pairs are EUR/USD, EUR/CHF, CHF/JPY, USD/JPY, AUD/NZD and AUD/USD. Will leave open until at least noon PST &amp; see what happens.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I am running two DEMOs: 1) One started today: AUDNZD 0.01 2.0 30x20 10 Max produced $39 on $300 running from 03.30 GMT to 16.30 GMT . Single trade of $21 in this. 2) Another demo started 4 days ago with GBPJPY and EURJPY : 30x25 0.1 lot 2.0 8 Max- account increased from $38Kto $69K. It produced $9k today! Surprisingly low draw down all along and level 8 reached twice only. JPY pairs were subdued since couple of days and hence survived I think. I ran USDJPY also on the first day, but it hardly produced any returns and I removed it. In fact GBPJPY alone produced 80% returns. I ran this aslo during above timings.

No a 100 pip profit is a 100 pip profit. What the broker gets keeps him in business so I can trade. I never begrudge a broker who is allowing me to take 500 dollars and let me trade like I got 50000 dollars. Most people simply dont appreciate their brokers and what they are allowing them to do with their money. So he gets an extra 8 cents on a penny trade. If I can make tens of thousands of dollars trading I hope IBFX makes millions. I am only risking 500 to 1000 most of the time. Brokers take a lot of criticism but where do you ever see someone say thank you for letting me trade with so little money.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
The loss at 10 levels is outlandish. I mean with a 50000 demo maybe but I dont trade 50000 in real life. I really am only going 8 levels with my trades. That stop loss is only if someone drops a bomb, I never let a trade get that far in the hole.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Bob, Thanks for your quick responses to my questions. Both were very helpful.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
im running 3 demos atm... -12 currencies with some more 'aggressive ones in there' as per the 7 year fact sheet - 10 currencies - more medium risk - 8 currencies with 'safer' pairs... ill give results friday.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
This is really interesting trading with 20 currencies, at the end of the USA session I am up 847 on my TP but I am carrying a 826 negative. I never got my retrace yet on the 3 pound currencies gbp/jpy, gbp/chf, gbp/usd. I can close it all and the day was a wash or I can see if they will retrace during the jpy session. If they retrace it will be a monster day if they dont its a wash. Interesting results. The question becomes, is it possible to not have a big loss, in other words, is there so much action in 20 currencies bouncing around that even if 3 currencies dont retrace the others will hold the fort for you?????? The final note is I definitely want to close before the EUR session because over two days you are probably guaranteed a currency will go out of range, since you can be assured some of them will continue their trend.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Well prices retraced some this morning (evening USA time) and I went and took my profit. The TP had moved up to 925 and the negative balance moved down to 560 so I said good enough. 369.66 total. Interesting. I am going to restart he EA and see what happens again today. I could live on 369 dollars a day.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
ok here are the results from day #1 Image 1: original EA with original pairs Starting balance $4000 open time 11/16 at 23:00 close time 11/17 21:43 profit: $50.75 Image 2: EA version .02 with all 20 pairs Starting balance $7000 starting lots .01 open time 11/16 23:00 close time 11/17 23:52 Profit: $749.74 Image 3: EA version .02 with safest 5 pairs chf/jpy, eur/gbp, eur/chf, eur/usd, usd/chf starting balance: $7000 starting lots: 0.1 open time 11/16 23:00 close time 11/17 21:45 Profit: $227.57 Image 4: original EA with original pairs starting balance $3000 open time 11/17 13:34 close time 11/17 23:53 profit: $ 13.72 any questions just ask will keep posting if yall want me to or i can just wait for a given amount of time. say Friday. makes me no difference.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
The reason im using $7000. that is what i have in my live account at the moment reason behind 1 $4000 and 1 $3000 of course that adds up to $7000 and i can open them up at different times to see which does better

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Thanks for all the info. In your study3, safest pairs had a substantial dip after reaching a profit of $600. Which particular pair caused this? I would like to know if it happens again.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
this is kind of how this ea works. you will win half and lose half as long as the winners outweigh the losers THERE YOU GO biggest loss what e/g of all things. worst loss $172.22 biggest gain e/u $232 but e/g was also the second highest gainer at $149.84 but not quite sure this is gonna help. im sure tomorrow will be completely different. we shall see. post next results tom. good night all

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Nanningbob and everyone, I'm quite excited with this set up and am currently testing on demo. I have changed my parameters slightly from the 100/80 set up. I have calculated the pips and tp from the 20 day daily average for each pair in my basket and so far I've got three for three profits for the past three trading days. I'll post the graph for the week at the end of my trading day on Friday - so far up $999 on $5k account so happy so far. This is basically what I'm trialling- Pips is calculated as twice the 20 day average divided by ten to give ten steps, then the TP is just the pips plus 20%. I am using a basket of 8 pairs, some big movers others not but a good mix of majors. E/U, U/J, G/U, U/CHF, E/J, G/J, A/U, A/J I start in the morning my time Aussie which is 00.00GMT on IBFX and close out when in profit my my target amount between $200 &amp; $300, that's enough for me on one account to sack the boss, I have noticed that this is just after the US open when there is usually enough retrace movement to reduce the floating trades below the banked trades for the day. I just let it go during the day and around tea time start watching the movement for an oportunity to close out. An EA for this could possibly close it all out when a certain dollar amount or percentage of account target is reached. Also it would be useful to have an alarm that could be set to alert you when a certain level is reached so you could monitor it or close out if it looks like it will get dangerous. Not sure if this is doable in this EA as it does already have some MM built in but needs more investigation. Anyway that's all, Good luck everyone (especially those that very obviously do not read through all the posts and don't fully understand what their dealing with - and put this on a live account with only a couple of hundred dollars in it - You will need as much luck as you can get) Pbully

--- 帖子 #295 ---
There is a function in the code that closes all trades when a certain profit is reached. I have not tested it yet but it is there.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I know you're not at your computer all day but what was your lowest margin level you saw yesterday trading 20 pairs? Must have been pretty low even with being near break-even. I'm assuming you started with $5000. Are you trading .02 lots or .05? Thanks

--- 帖子 #297 ---
The biggest DD I had was $689.64 on my 20 pair setup. starting at .01 lots recovered nicely - made $749.74

--- 帖子 #298 ---
In a few post above this one you stated that you also use some safe pairs? What do you mean with that?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Using .05, my demo account has made almost exactly 20% since Sunday evening when it opened trades at market open. The pairs I'm using are: EUR/USD, AUD/USD, CHF/JPY, USD/JPY, EUR/CHF, AUD/NZD. There was a drawdown of about 10%. I have let it run continuously, and will let it run without closing any trades for the entire week. Thgis will save on the spread going in and out.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I started with 3000 and am trading .10 lots. interesting huh.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
By safe pairs I mean the ones that haven't broken the 800 threshold in the last 7 years. See bob's hisory data a few posts back

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I did not realize you were running this live. I am sorry if this has been asked before as it is hard to keep up anymore, but how many levels deep and what pairs are you running? thanks

--- 帖子 #303 ---
nannigbob, so far, your system and EA is performing much better than I could have expected. My biggest concern would be a major trend on more than a few pairs, but I think with the proper mix of pairs, even that could be minimized. So far, I've done 1 and a half percent for 2 days going only .01 on 7 pairs on a $3,000.00 account, and 10% on a $4,000.00 going .05 on six pairs, with a 10% drawdown at one point. Are there any instructions available for the cut loss and equity settings portion of the EA? I know there are other EAs that would accomplish this, but it these are built into your EA, I'd rather use them. I want a catastrophe global stop on my account of about 25%.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Good im glad to see this. i started to do the same thing but didn't feel like setting up another account. I wanted to see how it worked out if you close your positions after a profit is gained. I have no set profit target, i just want to be positive on the day before i close. One reason i am taking it out is because i am wondering if the London session might get to violent sometimes for this to work out. More trends seem to develop during this market. It makes sense to me that this ea would workout better during ranging markets and london doesn't "usually" provide this. so keep it going and ill keep closing mine. ( hopefully ill be in profit before london open) we will compare at the end of the week. You are trading 1 more pair than me and im trading .1 lots on my "safer" pairs. but i think this will still give us a good idea of what is better. I know 1 week won't show us much so we need to keep this up for a little while. with a little help from everyone on this, I really believe we can come up with a winner Thanks everyone for yalls help. Lets keep testing this thing and we'll get it!!!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Inside the code of the EA is this: extern string so="--CUTLOSS SETTING--"; extern bool SecureProfitProtection=False; extern string SP="If profit made is bigger than SecureProfit we close the orders"; extern int SecureProfit=20; // If profit made is bigger than SecureProfit we close the orders extern string OTP="Number of orders to enable the account protection"; extern int OrderstoProtect=3; // Number of orders to enable the account protection extern string ASP="if one will check profit from all symbols, if cero only this symbol"; extern bool AllSymbolsProtect=False; // if one will check profit from all symbols, if cero only this symbol extern string EP="if true, then the expert will protect the account equity to the percent specified"; extern bool EquityProtection=False; // if true, then the expert will protect the account equity to the percent specified extern string AEP="percent of the account to protect on a set of trades"; extern int AccountEquityPercentProtection= 90; // percent of the account to protect on a set of trades extern string AMP="if true, then the expert will use money protection to the USD specified"; extern bool AccountMoneyProtection= False; extern double AccountMoneyProtectionValue= 3000.00; string s1="--seting berapa jam dia nak open order--"; red The first way to protect your account is to change the account equity protection from false to True and then specify the amount to protect. You change that number to 75 and it will shut down all trades after a 25% drawdown. Blue You dont want your account to go lower than the amount in blue so you turn the false to true and then set the amount you want all orders to be closed. If you have 4000 in the account you then set it for 3000. To find these just open the program, hit control f and you will have the word search system on . Type in account protection and you will then go to that section. I have not tested this part of the program very much so try it out on demo first before going live.

The USA session is much more volatile than the Euro session. Where do you get the evidence that the Euro is more volatile????????????? A trend bigger than 800 points in one day???? Do you realize how rare of an event that is????? Go study the 7 year fact sheet again. Then you have to compute the odds of a 800 pip move without a retracement an even rarer event. Even if a currency moves a 1000 points, there is almost always a retracement or two in the run. I have only seen it happen one time and that was the Eur/Aud last month. The NZD/USD has had two spikes of over 1500 but it is probable they move too fast even for an EA to pick up. Please read post 267 pg 18 to see the odds of such an event.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
bob do u have to change the code?? ive been right clicking on my charts then going into expert advisor&gt; properties then changing it in there then jsut resaving the template..... is this the wrong way? i did this to put the 825 SL for sells as it wasnt in the original file, works fine now

--- 帖子 #308 ---
No that is the alternative way. I do all my changes in the code however and never used the other way. Thats all. It should work doing it the way you are doing but I play with the code.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
okie doke just checking... knowing me id backspace on a backslash or something and itd go fickucked...

--- 帖子 #310 ---
whitegoodman, yes, you can just right click and make changes that way. However, they will only work on that 1 instance of the EA on the currency pair you just changed the settings on. The reason why bob, myself and others make changes in the code is that it makes that setting the new 'default' in the EA. So, all you have to do is compile, close MT4 and re-open and all currencies have the new setting (saves a few minutes of time).

--- 帖子 #311 ---
bob did read your post didn't mean to piss u off just throwing my 2 cents out there.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
second day's results 4 accounts all positive for both days image 1 original ea with original profile $4000 starting balance image 2 original ea with original profile $3000 starting balance image 3 ea .02 "safe" pairs at .1 lots image 4 ea .02 20 pairs at .01 lots So far the 20 pair ea is dominating. up 19.24% in only 2 days with max DD of only 662.46 or 7.89% looks good huh. but again only 2 days. hope it keeps this up!!! would be nice to be rich some day

--- 帖子 #313 ---
didnt piss me off just surprised

--- 帖子 #314 ---
whats the difference in the second EA? as stated above which is used in his last 2 demos?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
it is the ea .02 not the one from the first post just look at attachment icon and you will find it. then i use 0.1 starting point for the "safe" pairs and only .01 for the 20 pairs

--- 帖子 #316 ---
whats the difference in its function? different default lot size? different default levels?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Ok, I'll check that out. It's a nice diversification.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I am curious to know how various systems have performed after today's fluctuation?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi Guys, Firstly, thanks for a really great EA!! Secondly, I'm having a small problem that I'm hoping somebody can help me with. Everything seems to have loaded and is working fine except for one thing. The EA is only opening BUY trades, there doesn't seem to be any corresponding SELL entries. Anybody having the same prob? Thanks

--- 帖子 #320 ---
BUY EA and SELL EA have to be loaded on two separate charts for each currency and if you have done this right, compare the EA properties for any errors in lot size etc. (0.01 for IBFX, otherwise 0.1 on other demo)

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Urban, I had the same problem with the sell EA. I think there may be a problem with the sell EA that trades .01. Try loading the sell EA that trades .02 and see if that works. you can manually change the .02 to any amount. That's what I've done. I'm demoing on a $3,000.00 account, and .01 and .02 turned out to be too small of an amount for my risk tolerance, so I've manually changed the buy and sell EAs to .03, and it's working fine.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Just reporting for those interested. Am trading .05 on only 6 pairs EUR/USD, EUR/CHF, CHF/JPY, USD/JPY, AUD/NZD, AUD/USD. The graph shows starting from the open on Sunday evening to about 9:00 AM Pacific Standard Time starting at $4,000.00 and now at a gross of almost $5,900.00 The open loss is $375.00, so the net is $5,625.00 if I sold all right now. For whatever reason, the graph does not show the true drawdown picture. There was an open loss earlier of $800.00, and this isn't reflected in the graph. That's 15% of the account value. It's now turned around. Am letting run continuously for the entire week. My main thinking is to see what these 6 pairs will give consistently at .05, and how much drawdown in dollars there would be. Right now, I don't know, and really want to know what a worst case scenario would be. Could the open losses go as high as $1,500.00? $2,000.00, $3,000.00. With this information, I can set a global stop at a certain percentage. As it is, the increase is 40%. Fantastic so far!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Thanks, I forgot to add the sell EA!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
are you using the 100 x 80 or 100 x 60? max trades?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Using what I think is the original one 100x80. The only settings I change is the lots to be traded. Running two demos with the referenced one trading at .05 for 6 pairs. I have another trading more pairs at .03. I've noticed that has much less drawdown, and also less percentage return.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Bob, In trying to understand your thinking and the way you use the EA....I know you mentioned several times that you often take profit when you see it. Today I opened the 100x80 EA (.02 lots) at the US open. It's been a crazy day so far. I've banked (demo account) $592 of profit so far (on a $3,240.90 starting balance), but I have a floating loss of $408. What do recommend in this instance? Should I let the floating losses ride and wait for a retracement or close all orders? If I close all orders, would you start the EA again in the US session or wait for the Asia open? Thanks for your help, Anthony

--- 帖子 #327 ---
The 100x80 is designed to cover 800 pips, which is easily managed with that size of an account. Take a look at the below picture. You can see that as long as the currency retraces 100 pips in your favor within that 800 pip coverage, you make money. This should happen 99% of the time within 800 pips. Of course, you still need to decide if you want to close it all and hop out. With such a large account, you should be able to make the retrace by playing the odds but that's up to you. The 100x80 uses outstanding settings with great coverage if you have a decent sized account.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
well like he said it could retrace and make that up but if it doesn't then you are still up a little over 5% in one day to me that is pretty dang good. I would fold up tent and wait for tomorrow. I too opened 4 demos at open of US and are all doing fine will close and post results before i go to bed

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Any profit is better than any loss. Any small loss is better than any large loss. However, it is a demo account which means it's perfect for testing an EA, and perfect for seeing what the 100x80 can (and can't) do. The question of letting it ride vs closing it out for the day is up to you. You are covered for 800 pips and I don't know of any pairs that have come close to that yet today. If you go to 1000, that's when you need to shut things down in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Well I let it ride to see what would happen (if this were a real account I definitely would have taken the money!). As of 4:10pm est. My banked profit is now $733, but my floating loss is $718. So at this point, it's basically break even. I asked the question to help understand how the EA works and would the "correct" thinking should be. If the pairs don't retrace by the end of the US session, would it best to close out and take a small profit/loss or best wait for Asia session for a possible retrace? If we close the trades now in the US session and reopen the trades in the Asia session and the price retraces would we pick up the profits on the retrace movement or are they lost? At what point do we start worrying that we are on the wrong side and that it might not retrace? How exactly do we determine that? The GBP/USD has opened a lot size of 0.16, so it's at the 4th level (correct?) and has a cummulative loss of $300. The other $400 is spread out between the other pairs. Again, just trying to detemine the "correct" line of thinking when using this EA. I think it would be helpful for all of us. What would Bob do? (lol)

--- 帖子 #331 ---
The JPY session is where you will get enough retrace to make a profit. I posted this just a couple of days ago. I was at break even and then the retrace happened and profited just under 400 dollars.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
You will always have a floating loss because you pocket the profits. Once you get used to this, it is just a matter of what profits you want to pocket. Here is a demo of my week so far, I am up over 800 dollars, you can see where I closed and took my profits. The important part is not the highs of the chart but the lows of the chart because they are your real profits. It just keeps moving up. It takes time to understand and get a feel of this. There is a patience of waiting for the retrace. I know in the past I have talked about closing at certain times but the market does not move or retrace based the time of day. It may move at any hour and retrace at any hour. If we knew what times these things always happened we would all be millionaires.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
so...If we've banked some profit and have a floating loss that brings us to about break-even for the day, it's best to wait for the JPY session for a retrace, correct? What if we didn't have banked profit, but only floating loss? Is it still best to wait for the JPY session? What if this scenario happened during the JPY or London session (banked profit with a floating loss), would it be best to wait for the US session for retrace? Sorry for all the questions...I'm just trying to develop the correct way of thinking. Thanks for all your help. Anthony

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I'm certainly ok with waiting for the retrace, or even taking a loss if I have to. The results so far have been outstanding. I'm up over 25% in a week and a half of testing. Most importantly, I've learned more from this thread than any other I've read. I guess what I'm trying to learn more about is how you determine if we should wait for the retrace or determine it's a bad trade and we should cut our losses and get out. I know you mentioned looking at the 4h chart and the support and resistance levels for that determination. If you could elaborate a bit, that would be great. What exactly do you do? What indicators do you put on the chart? What do you look for? At what point do you start thinking it might be a bad trade? Btw, isn't it 5am for you? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
From my studies of Forex I have come to some conclusions. One of them is the market never moves in a straight line. So there will always be a retrace. Second is the retrace can be small or big, I may not know what it is so when I see a profit I take it but often that decision is based on support and resistance levels. If a retrace hits one I have to decide if there is more or that is it. Third profit is profit, I never beat myself up for taking it and then realizing there might have been more. Here is an important gbp/chf trade that happened Monday. You can see a big runup to the red letter a. Price than did a retrace but not quite enough to hit the 100 points. However, it was hitting a support line and over a 14 hour period it hit that support about 6 times. Well, when it hit the 5th time I went ahead and took it. My overall profit at that time ended up over 300 dollars that day. I did not want to keep that trade going into the Euro session because I could have faced a death trade if price had continued up. So that is why I took my profit when I did. I was deepest into the GBP/CHF so that was the currency I based my decision on for all the trades. Once I saw that nice profit and the hitting of support the decision was made to close it all and restart the full range of the EA. The support and resistance lines on the screen are Wed. The indicator I use redraws the lines every day so they dont count for Monday. The lines were different at that time.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Its 620 am here, I usually get up around 6. We dont have savings time here so we are 11 hours off from EST instead of 12. You will notice by my last post I liked my profit retrace from the USA session so I took it this morning. I will let the market settle a little bit more and then restart my EA again later this morning. I am really seriously thinking of running this ea on 20 pairs live next week with about 500 dollars and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
It was a rather good day for Aud/Nzd. At least for me anyway, I look forward to see what your new position in the contest in three hours.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I moved up to 21 place. I am not going to place with 4 trading days left but in side the top 20 or 15 looks doable. I am consistently hitting 10% a day with this EA I am using. Thanks to Frost Calls excel program I have been able to refine this thing where it is much more efficient than some of my past numbers. Next month I will start with 300 instead of 600 and then I would be in the 300% increase range instead of 100% range. I will start a new thread and post the EA this weekend. The EA on the Aud/Nzd and the 100/80 in this thread look to be consitent money makers so I will run both of them live in December. I am going to cut me a check next week on my contest account and it should be around 700 and the one I cut this week for 500 is sure going to help the old budget. I have a friend who is also testing this EA live and is averaging about 4-500 a week. I just hope IBFX doesnt increase the spread on it again. It used to be 11 but now its 14 I have to get ready for work, will check in again later.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Sounds good. I look forward to seeing if the changes you made are anything like the one I have made. Until then, good luck trading! My check is going to be pretty nice as well thanks to your EAs. Thanks. Hehe, yeah... that is really the easiest thing for them to do if a lot of people start taking alot from A/N. The inner me is thinking dont open a thread and it become really popular, but then I think well thats in no way fair because how did I get the ea. Not to mention the majority of the people come and go. Then ago if a ton of people start trading aud/nzd that should lower the spread.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Even if a 10,000 people used my EA it would not even make a blip on the screen. No fund manager is going to use my EA. This is designed to make some money and pull the money out every week or two. Guys with huge accounts wont like the percentage of DD. Imagine playing with 1,000,000 dollars and facing a 10-25% DD. They aint gonna do it. With 500 -1000 bucks its no problem. Without the big boys we will be well under the radar.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Bob, Thanks for the replies and all your help. Could you elaborate a bit on how you evaluate the trades. What exactly do you do? What indicators do you put on the chart? What do you look for? At what point do you start thinking it might be a bad trade? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Bob pardon my benevolent curiosity but just wanted to know how long you've been into forex and whether you're a professional trader? You have things so well figured out I'd be surprised if the answer to my question was no, but I'm just curious to know.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Bob will probably have some more to add.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thank you Toothman, Where do I find the PB autopivots indicator and description by Bob of how to use it? I don't recall seeing it in this thread and its not on the attachment list. Is it in the 100x40 thread or another thread? I'm only 1/2 way reading through the 100x40 thread.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
hi guys... from about 149 at the bottom of the chart I include A/Z before that I use the profile bob attached for 100x80 For A/Z here are my settings 30x10, 0.1, 10 level max, x2 for each level. It is when the A/Z was included things started to fly. I turn on the EA +1 after japan market starts, and close all trades mid of the euro market. There was quite a dip near 296, that was cause by A/Z too. I could not be around the PC after mid of euro market, so I decided to take the hit. Start with this account since 30 Oct with 3k. Been 2.5 weeks and with a profit of 1.4K.

Using FrostCalls excell program this is what you are facing: range 100 pips floating DD @ 100= -2036.00 lot size at level 10 51.20 stop loss at 200 pips = -12,266 ahhhhhhhh, I hate to say this guy but you are looking at a total disaster if you keep these numbers one day. May I recommend the following tp 50 reenter 15 multiply 1.4 lot size .05 SL 180 MAX COVERAGE TOTAL Floating DD -172.2 profit 68.3 Stoploss DD -283.2 ratio profit to loss 17:43 I am making 40-80 bucks a day using these numbers. I am using 2 accounts instead of pushing one to its limits. 1-150 a day is not bad PT income.

I have been trading 3 years Part Time. After trading almost 2 years I threw out everything I was taught and decided to study the market myself. I had one rule: I am only going to trade what I find to be 100% or almost 100% true. If it didnt meet that standard I was not going to use it. I ended up throwing out all indicators, fib lines, methodologies and decided to think the opposite of what I was taught and learned. I was intrigued by the martingale system but saw nothing but disaster. I then reasoned everyone was trying to solve Martingale trading by bigger account, more lots, levels, indicators, etc, etc. What happens if i did the opposite. Fewer levels, less money, less risk, less multiplier, what would happen and tada........... you can make money with reasonable controls. The biggest breakthrough was my 7 year currency facts and the ability to see that currencies have limits of what they can do in one day. This led to the conclusion that if my EA covers a range bigger than what they move I can safely trade a modified martingale system. My 100/40 was a success until the markets went crazy a month ago and markets began moving greater than its 3-400 pip range. I had started about 3 months ago playing with trading both directions at the same time. I had shelved that idea until the markets went crazy and I came up with a 800 pip range EA. Put it all together you get the 100x80 and another EA that works perfectly with a small group of currencies. I will post that one this weekend with my 1 month of live trading results. I started with 500 dollars and I am over 2000 now. I will document and show everything. Between that EA and this one 100x80 you can trade almost any currency in almost any market conditions except when they get really extreme. Sorry, but my answer to those days is to just stay out. I have talked to some professional traders about my ideas and they think I am crazy and nuts. I have thrown out everything they have been taught or believe and they are too set to change. Large sl, penny trades, high leverage, small amounts of capital, you know all the things they preach against. One of my best friends has been trading for over a decade and I finally got him to try my little EA. Made 500 bucks in a week and didnt have to strain over a computer all day. He kind of likes it.

It is funny because I had always passed up this thread until I tried it for one week and saw the results. When these other ideas of trading are pounded into your head from day one it is hard to step back and see the clear picture.

"Between that EA and this one 100x80 you can trade almost any currency in almost any market conditions except when they get really extreme. Sorry, but my answer to those days is to just stay out." nanningbob, what's the best way to predict when the market will be extreme? By that I mean, when do you know when to bail, or when do you know the market will reverse so you don't have to bail? What do you use to tell you that the market is going to continue trending?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
700 billion dollar bailouts for one, interest rate changes, Bernanke or Trichet tesitfying or making major announcements. Not regular news stories but the big ones that will fundamentally change the market. They dont happen very often but lately we have had several. I would really keep an eye out for GM. If congress doesnt bail them out we are in for one rough ride. I dont know if anyone is going to be able to trade that. They estimate GM produces over 3,000,000 jobs in the USA with all the suppliers, sales, etc. A 25 Billion bailout is peanuts compared to what would happen if they filed bankruptcy. It is not that I support bailouts but we may have no choice. GM goes under so does Ford and Chrysler because all the companies that supply them parts will go under too and the companies that supply the suppliers and the raw materials. EGADS ............ when people were predicting the bubble is going to burst, they werent kidding. We are living in very ugly times.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I will further answer your question later but I have to go teach now. I also have some simple indicators that will help and give you advance warning your heading for trouble. The 100x80 though is going to be really hard to break even in a wild market. The problem is the loss when it does. More later gotta go.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
OK. Thanks. Gotcha. Any major event will make the market keep trending one way or the other for awhile, and time to stay on the sidelines. I don't like ugly, but I don't think we should reward inefficiency, and should let the auto makers fail. There are union workers that were displaced by machines that do nothing but sit and do crossword puzzles for full pay all day long because the union contract says they can't lose their job (strapping gas tanks, putting on a bolt, etc.) when a machine takes over that function. That's a whole other topic, though.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Yikes!! Those settings made my dog cry A good idea for checking out your settings is to look at what would happen if things went against you a few hundred pips or so. In the case of the settings you had listed above, it was REALLY BAD. The reward is not worth it. For 100 pip coverage, you should be looking for a max payout of $30-50, not $200, with a DD of maybe $80. Also try to get a coverage that's 30-50% greater than what you think you need. Posted here again, is the settings finder. For the record, I'm a big fan of the 100x40 and 100x80.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Yes you are right, sometimes it is verry hard to see clarly what you have to do. For newbies like me it are verry great lessons.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
ok this may be a little unrelated (so pm with answers) but any of you guys using ibfx live outside of the US... i was just looking into getting a live account but theres an issue. Say i deposit $1000 AUD, it then gets converted to say $600USD. If i trade that to $800 USD and want to withdraw it it gets converted to australian dollars back. That means if the exchange rate goes down more i could actually receive less than $1000 AUD even though ive made money??? what the?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I honestly can not answer your question but my advice would be to ask IBFX as they would most certainly be able to answer that.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
How about thinking the other way ? What if the exchange rate goes up ? In order to get $800 USD to be less than A$1000. AUD/USD has to go 0.8000. Do u think that will happen in 1 - 2 months before u do ur withdrawal ? Exchange rate isn't really a big problem if u withdraw ur money monthly or bi-monthly. Actually, u can make that into ur advanage by doing technially analaysis of AUD/USD on the weekly chart and time ur withdrawal and get more from ur profit.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
yeh the problem is the aussie dollar is so beaten down at the moment that my initial withdrawls could take a hammering if it goes back up. I asked the live chat person and he said ibfx is done in US dollars.... hmm i dunno i may have to use GO markets which is australias first and only mt4 broker, but they go to 5 decimals which is annoying. Beggers cant be choosers i guess, jsut hope they do micros cos this system for a small live trial wont go well betting big lots me thinks. also on a side note how do i get the 'close all trades' thing to work, im spending 15mins a nite trying to close all trades in the demos im running at the moment.. i told ya id have a heap of silly questions... EDIT: smallest lot size on GOmarkets is 0.1 or $1 US a pip (think thats how it goes).... SAVE ME JEBUS!

--- 帖子 #361 ---
whitegoodman, try this one . Put it in your Scripts file. It seems to work on these ea's. just drag it or doubleclick it to the chart.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Well..I've been waiting for a retrace since yesterday and it hasn't happened yet. My floating loss is now $1,710, but worse than that my free margin is down to $7 from a balance of $4,241. It may have even gone into negative margin while I was sleeping. Is there a way to check? The GBP/USD, AUD/USD, AUD/CHF seems to be ones causing the most trouble. The S&amp;R (attached) seems to above the S1 line. I think it might be time to sell everything and cut our losses, before I get a margin call? Bob, can you please explain how I could have avoided this by looking at the charts. Thanks, Anthony

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Are u doing this live ?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
no...just a demo. If this were a real account, I would have taken my small profit out yesterday before the US close. I had banked a lot of profit by then, but I also had a large floating balance. In the interest of learning how the EA (and the markets) work, I let it ride into the JPY and waited for a retrace. However, waiting has caused my free margin to be used up! I suppose it's one of the dangers...unless I did something wrong or have the wrong setup.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hope that u will post the new thread on the same forum section with this thread. I find that the "Trading Systems" section has a lot of unnecessary noise and sometimes the people there pissed the thread owner off and end up closing the thread. Looking forward to ur other EA this weekend. Thnx for everything u had given to us.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I hope this unfortunate situation will be avoided here somehow.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Frostcall, I'm confused as to what the numbers on the sprteadsheet mean. Under the last column, the MAX column, where you show floating loss of -1628.80, I assume that's in dollars? Is that what the drawdown would be for buying and selling just one pair? Would it be twice that for each pair added? I'm demoing at .05 using the 100X80 on 6 pairs, and have a drawdown of $5,000.00 with only two pairs going to the fourth level. Based on this, I guess it's possible to have a drawdown of $1,628.80 and a stop loss of $3,674.80 just going .01 on just one pair. Is this a correct assumption?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Unfortunately there will always be trolls that just want to upset everyone. I suggest we simply ignore them if they come to nanningbob's thread.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi All, It appears that I am having the same luck as acosta and not getting the same results as most people seem to be in the thread. I opened a fresh demo and starting trading last night at 7pm (GMT+2) and let it run through the night. This morning when I woke up I was pretty bummed to see that my floating loss was way past when I actually would've been margin called had it been a live account. Anyways, I thought it may have been cos I traded in the US session, so at 7am this morning (GMT+2) I started afresh. Sad to say that I just checked and my DD was about 70% and I would've already been margin called. The smallest account Alpari demo offers is 3000, but in the back of my mind I have had the 500 buck figure as discussed numerous times, and sorry to say that I would've been margin called twice in the last 24 hours. I'm trading the standard 0.01 settings. Anybody else experienceing this??

--- 帖子 #370 ---
The thing is Alpari does not allow nano lots like Interbank fx so .01 lot is really ten times larger equivalent to .10 lots. In other words you were effectively trading a $300 account. A $500 account would still probably have margined out. I think you really need a much larger starting balance to safely handle the large moves that a currently happening.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
That may make sense, Alpari's 0.01 lots = 10c. At IBFX does 0.01 lots = 1c? If that is the case, then I should open a 5000 account and trade 0.01 lots with alpari to compare apples for apples. Would this be correct?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
My demo is with IBFX so I think .01 lot is really .01. I Started with $3,000 and .02 lots and 14 pairs.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I'm trading .01 lots and on USDCAD, USDJPY, EURUSD, AUDUSD, EURJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF and AUDJPY

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Yes, that would be correct.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
OK, just to make 100% sure, let's take an example here. If I close a USD trade for the 100 pip profit it's worth 10 bucks. Are you telling me that 100 pip profit for you at 0.01 on IBFX is only $1?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I am also in the same boat, but I have a seperate US Dollar account with my bank. This way you can convert the currency whenever the rates are favourable to you. Just check with your bank if they allow this. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
You got it. (1c per pip, 100c per 100 pips).

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Right, well I'll restart with a 5000 account then trading 0.01 lots and let you guys know how it goes. Thanks for all the help!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Trading 6 pairs at .05 and letting my account run all week has brought me a drawdown of a little over $5,000.00, and caused some trades to be closed out. Quite an eye opener to see what a heavily trending market can do, and just how big of a difference there is between .01, .03, and .05. Before the start of the US session, I was down about $3,000.00 and the drawdown magnified after that. On my demo account using .03, the biggest drawdown to date has been only $300.00 with two pairs now at level 5 (CHF/JPY and AUD/USD). The other pairs on this demo are EUR/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/CHF, USD/CHF, NZD/USD, and USD/JPY for a total of 8 pairs. A $5,000.00 plus drawdown on 6 pairs at .05 versus a $300.00 drawdown on 8 pairs at .03

Hi All, I have been studying &amp; running the original 100*80 EA since end Oct. My original demo account has grown from $2000 (29 Oct) to $3942 (now) starting with 0.01 as trade size. It includes a few big ones, like $399-50 (level = 5.12) today on USDCAD. Yes, I know Bob said to drop this one, but I have not done that just yet. Note - this account has been run "continuously" from starting around 6h00 GMT on a Monday until some time on a Friday. As for DD, this was around -$1300 somewhere in the first week or two, and the worst I saw today was around -$800!! Current DD = -$78!! I started 3 more demo accounts with the same settings, but at different start times this week. Results thus far are - Acc 1 - started on Sundaye eve - now at $2462 and DD = -$42!! Acc 2 - Started Mon at +-03h00 GMT - now at $2398 and DD = -$70 Acc 3 - Started Mon at +- 08h00 GMT - now at $2147 and DD = -$58 - note for some reason on this account only the Buy EA is triggering!!! If anyone is interested, I'd gladly make the detailed trade history available as far as I have saved it, especially for the demo account running since 29 Oct. Regards Suzette

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi, it would be helpful to know the pairs that you're using in each demo account. I am using some pretty safe pairs in both demo accounts, and had a huge drawdown in the .05 account using only 6 pairs.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
That IBFX account is a "Mini" Account. If it were a "Standard" IBFX account it would be $10. (trading 0.01 lots on an IBFX Standard account is .10 (ten cents) a pip The same 0.01 lots on a "Mini" account is .01 (1 cent ) a pip. You must be using a "standard" Lot size account at 0.01 or you are trading 0.10 on a mini.:nerd:

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi there, I'm still using the original 12 pairs / 0.01 starting position on IBFX mini demo accounts - AUDJPY &amp; AUDUSD CHFJPY EURCHF &amp; EURJPY &amp; EURUSD GBPUSD NZDCHF &amp; NZDJPY USDCAD &amp; USDCHF &amp; USDJPY As I was not constantly watching the accounts today, I only know the rough DDs indicated in my previous post. Suzette

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I'm thinking my problem may have been caused by the way I set up my IBFX account to only use 1:100 leverage instead of 1:200. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
You are right, higher the leverage better it can handle the large DD. IBfx offers 1:400 leverage for mini account.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I have let the 100X80 run from 2100 est Sunday until now. Today I have a balance of 2107 from a starting balance of 1000. The most drawdown has been from today -1134.00 66.30%. I used the following pairs usdchf, eurusd,usdjpy,chfjpy and audusd. I must say closing out everyday would seem to be better than just letting it run on it's own.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I also don't have the "m" suffix on my charts. Should the charts have an "m"?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
... your on a standard account you need to switch over to a mini one.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Assuming you have a stoploss set at 1000 (so the very first lot purchased will close at negative 1000 pips), yes, IF one pip move at .01 = $0.01 like it does with the EURUSDm on IBFX. Most currency pairs are not like that, so on most, 0.01 lots at 1 pip do not = $0.01 Some, like the EURJPYm are MUCH larger. Most are pretty close to the $0.01 figure on IBFX micro anyway. Perhaps in a future version of the settings finder, I will have it adjust to the currency pair but for now, think of it not as $0.01 but as 1 pip movement at 1 lot. So, if you were to multiply 0.01 lots by 100 pips, you get the equivalent of 1 pip movement on 1 lot (whatever that may be for your broker and currency pair). Obviously, 100 pip movements for the EURUSD is quite different than 100 pip movements for the EURJPY. See attached picture and sort the numbers to see what I mean. on the eurusdm, if you subtract 1.2498 (purchased price) from 1.2523 (current price), you get .25 which fits perfectly with -$0.25. the EURUSD is a 1:1 using the Settings Finder. But if you look at another, like the EURCADm, subtract 1.6122 (purchase) from 1.6067 (current) you get 0.0055. Since the loss is currently at -$0.43, that means it's obviously not a 1:1. ======= On a different note, if you have $500 in your account, real or demo, then it's probably not a great idea to run the 100x80 on 6 pairs. Your account is not big enough. Nanningbob is testing and perfecting some settings on certain pairs that will work better at smaller coverages, hence being better suited for smaller accounts like many people use.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
THIS is what I like to see, up and down, up and down. That's pure money right there.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I think IBfx mini account should have suffix 'm'. If you don't have that means you probably have a standard account.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
thankyou

--- 帖子 #394 ---
im currently running 3 demos on ibfx with starting balance of $3000 and im using 0.01 on a standard or 0.1 on a mini for lot size. Running on 8,10 and 12 currencies for each demo... max drawdown has been like 11% for all demos. Am i just lucky? is the lot size a bit risky? might be something to do with the fact im not trading during the US session.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I am not sure what you are referring to here. The gbp/usd trade only moved 175 points during the day. Well withing the EAs range. If you came from yesterdays action there were plenty of retracements?? The aud/usd shows 111 for the day and 256 the day before. The Aud/Chf and 124 and 225. All easily within the range of the EA and all have retracements for taking profit or getting out with a small loss. You are using the .02 which means lots by the way not pennies. If you are using a micro account with IBFX your figures dont make any sense. If you are using a regular or mini and .02 = .20 cents then you are way overplaying the market with only a 4000 dollar account. Again guys, you got to know what your are trading, is your account a penny account or a dime account ???????????????

--- 帖子 #396 ---
NO if your account is a penny account you are fine. If you are playing dimes which you indicate then that depends on how many currencies and which ones you are running. When you are .01 on a standard account and .10 on a mini I think you are trading the same amount. Again what are you trading dimes or pennies? It makes all the difference in the world !!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
The US session has been very bad the past few days. With the bailout talk, and now the failure of the auto bailout today, I think that's made for market extremes. My drawdown on an account I am using .03 as the starting amnount has only seen a $300.00 drawdown. In this kind of market, that's very good as far as I'm concerned. On my other demo account where I set it at .05, I just discovered that was not a mini account, and it got blown up. Looking forward to nanningbobs report next week on his testing.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I opened a new account from scratch using $3,000 and 1:200 leverage. Opening 28 trades (14 pairs) with .02 lots used up only $14 of margin. Does that sound right? In my previous account with 1:100 leverage it would use up close to $300 for the same pairs.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
yeh they are the same, im using dimes... too risky? ill post my results tonight when US market closes...

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Very risky... you go from .01-.02 to .10? That is 5x the amount of risk and margin.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
problem is the smallest i can trade on GO markets is 0.01 on standard which means dimes.... in my testing the drawdown has only been 10% at worst, keep in mind i dont trade the US session.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I don't know white... I'd test it in demo and see how the account is when it is near/in a death trade. On another note.... nanning what happen to your aud/nzd live account? I don't see it in the top 100s even though you were 20th yesterday. Did you get a death trade? I've had a stellar past two days.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I took a loss yesterday so I asked for my 500 dollars in profit and exited the contest. I knew I had gotten beat and wasnt going to place high. The AUD/NZD did not cause the problem, I was also trading the EUR/CAD and it never retraced. So I took my loss of 300 dollars and took my profit for the month. I also took 400 from my other account so I am getting 900 dollars for the month. I was looking at a 1000 and 500 until last night but 900 is ok since I only started with 500 in one account in late OCT. I will start a new thread this weekend and write about it, probably start it tonight. I am also testing the AUD/NZD on just 200 dollars just to see if it can be done. I think I can. I will started with that today.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Getting near death trade is something that everyone should get used to. If u never got a death trade in demo account, don't trade live becoz u don't see what's coming in death trade. Especially in live trades, when u are 1 - 2 level away from death trade, the psychological will kick in hard into u. U don't know whether to cut loss or stick till the last level until it blow up. For those who is new to this should really learn how the EA behaviors and try to baby sit the EA from the moment u turn on the EA. U will learn a lot by observing how the EA take the trade. Like nanningbob said before, try to blow up several demo account and u will learn from it.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
hmmm surely if i run pennies on an account with 5 grand it cant get blow up easily??

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Good times. I only have been using Aud/nzd and am up a pretty good amount. About 20% on my account. I've actually been using the built in MM/risk percentage for the smoother equity curve. You can totally do it on a smaller account with higher lots, but since my account is larger I like it.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
It isn't pennies though you said it was dimes. Pennies and dimes are a big difference with this system.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
sorry my mind runs a bit quick, that was a follow up question, jsut looked on fxcm , they run micros and can have the defulat account in aussie dollars $5000 on pennies or 0.02 would be fairly safe considering i dont play the US session??

--- 帖子 #409 ---
IMO, in longer term, it's not about blowing up live account, it's about blowing up the trades. If the trades reaches last level and it hit another level, all trade will be close will a loss, we are talking about a loss which clear out most/all of ur profit u previously earn slowly everyday.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I think so... to be perfectly honest I don't use 100x80 on the different pairs. I only trade Aud/nzd. I have been around the thread though and have demoed it. On that note, I think you would be 'fairly safe' as far as margin requirments go. As far as how many pairs, times, and lot sized under .05 as your max I think it is something you need to decide. I reccomend demoing different lot sizes, etc treating it live for at least a month. I know it seems like a long time, but it gives you the chance to experience some of the different ways the market can react and how the EA reacts as well as how it works.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
this is true, im not going live for a bit, im jsut trying to get organised so to speak so when i do itll jsut be flicking on the switch... dont thing fxcm is mt4 hmm my search for someone who does micros and has the account balance in Australian dollars continues.. EDIT: oh wait it does, it has two platforms, silly me EDIT EDIT: damnit they dont run micros for mt4 only there other platform, damnit

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Would an EA that closes out all trades at the equity value you set protect you against this death trade? If you go a small amount such as .02 or .03 on 6 to 8 safest pairs, and make maybe 3-5% a week, how about attaching a separate EA that will close out all trades at a 20% loss? That way, you don't blow an account, and can trade another day when the market isn't heavily trending. At this point, I don't don't know whether 20% or some other number would be best. I need to see more history on the demo. Just how often would this death scenario pop up?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
One thing to take note for everyone. Demo and live trade have slightly different results. Sometimes, ur trades in demo account TP and ur live account don't TP (both switch on EA at the same time). If u have success doing demo, use cents to further live trade demo before u use dollar.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I run an ibfx demo and an ibfx live account together and I have noticed a very 'slight' difference in tp/sl orders. By slight I mean there is about a 15$ balance different for a month of trading. That isn't horrible in my mind, althought it would suck if say the one trade your live account misses that your demo makes happens to be the death trade one.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yeah, that's bound to happen simply due to process priority, timing and other factors. It's kind of like if you dial a radio station to be the 100th caller from two cell phones on the same service at the same time. You can't both be caller #100, but you should be rather close. $15 is pretty darn close for a month.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
damnit that close all positions thing doesnt work for me.... i put it into experts&gt;scripts. Then i relaunched mt4 and then double clicked it and keeps coming up with an annoying failed to close bell... any tips? now ive added a new one and i double click to add to chart then it does nothing? am i missing something?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Have u tick the "Allow live trade" ?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
ok heres one week testing... all account started off with $3000 and was dime lot size with 8 levels, standard 100 x 80 settings in the original EA. Also note I switch on right at the start of the Sydney session (i live in Sydney and go to work at 7.30ish) and close before i go to bed bout 30min or so before or right on the US session start. However on tuesday i let it run through the night as at worst it was only 2 levels deep on all accounts, which can be seen in the spike upwards on all charts on the second day. Demo 1 - 12 currencies - more aggressive Pairs: EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, EURJPY, EURCHF, GBPCHF, AUDCAD, CHFJPY, AUDJPY End Total: $3346.73 MAX DD: approx $800ish (not at computer all day) Graph 1... Demo 2 - 10 currencies - medium Pairs: EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, EURJPY, EURCHF, CHFJPY, AUDJPY End Total: $3480.67 MAX DD: approx $500ish (not at computer all day) Graph 2... Demo 3 - 8 currencies - safer Pairs: AUDCAD, EURUSD, CHFJPY, EURCHF, USDCHF, AUDUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD End Total: $3189.97 MAX DD: approx $250ish (not at computer all day) Graph 3...

Hi all Here's my results for the week. Started at 05.16 GMT 17/11 Ended 12.35 GMT 21/11 Ran 100x80 6 safest currencies as per Bob lots start 0.05 x2 every 80 pips Profit $553.30 largest DD $235.88 - chfjpy - it went 7 levels before retracing - lot size by then was 3.2 and when hit profit = $333 just for that trade alone - the whole group in theory at 7 levels should close out for a net gain of $163, but due to speed of price change the actual figure was $123 - that's the large hump in the graph below. Not quite sure how I feel about such a large DD - demo is definitely diff. from Live..... as this happened whilst a healthy amount had been banked then it was much easier to watch than if it had started the week that way! Obviously there is much potential here..... I am also running 3 variations of the AUDNZD pair and am waiting for a retrace as they are all carrying hefty DD at the moment...... will post results later. Jim PS whitegoodman - attached is the CloseAll script as recommended by Bob - works well for me.

Pairs I am testing are: USD/CHF, EUR/USD, CHF/JPY, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, EUR/CHF, NZD/USD, starting on 11-14. I've let them run continuously from Sunday evening at market open. I started at .01, and that was too slow, and went to .02, and .03 for the past two days. Have closed out all and profit is $358.00 for the week. The AUD/USD went to the 6th level before reversing. Largest drawdown was about $325.00. Looking forward to next week for additional tests on different pairs and different amounts.

Just found this thread a few days ago. Great work Nanningbob in developing this strategy and sharing. I saw you post where you were testing 20 pairs with .1 lot each. Thought I'd try a similar approach. Here are my results. IBFX demo $5000 mini account with 400:1 leverage 22 pairs including GBP/JPN and EUR/AUS .1 lot on each pair Started 11/19/2008 and let it run continously. Will close before end of day Friday. Max drawdown observered was about -$2500.00 Current balance as of this post: $8560.00 Current open trades: -$160.00 Net Equity: $8400.00 Not sure if I've just hit a lucky streak or if this will continue. I'm sure this might be considered too risky with too much drawdown. Appreciate hearing more about your results with this many pairs Nanningbob. Thanks again to all for sharing. Field UPDATE: Thanks for the feedback Paradoxical. The account started with $5000, so it was a 50% drawdown. Not sure I could take that in a real account. I've closed all trades for the week. The EA ran continuously for 46 hours from Wedneday afternoon to Friday afternoon. Second chart below is after closing all trades. Probably should reduce the risk. Maybe I'll cut lot size in half and start with .05. Beginning with .1 brings it to 51.2 lots on the 10th level. Not sure IBFX will even allow more than 50 lots per trade. Really anxious to hear of Nanningbob's results. Will restart my test on Sunday evening. Thanks, Field

Newera, with a $2,500.00 drawdown on a $4,000.00, I think that's far too much to consider on a live account. Maybe if the account were $20,000. to $40,000.00, it would be OK. Interesting to know, though, that you traded all of those pairs with the high spreads , and had only a $2,500.00 drawdown verus a gain of $3,600.00 for just one week. At a tenth of that, it would be a gain of $360.00 versus a drawdown of $250.00. I'd take that kind of risk to return any day.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Disable EA master switch, then trigger script CloseAll. Then you have two panels - Common and Inputs. In common, untick enable alerts, tick allow live trading. In Inputs, I also change Option from 0 to 1 (dunno really why, I always do that). Trades must start to close within 10 seconds. There is a possibility, that process will stop in the middle before all trades are closed, probably cause one trade failed to close and that disabled whole process. In this case just start CloseAll again as described.

One of my audnzd live accounts for the week. Max equity drawdown was 205$.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Can you post your settings on this?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yup. I've posted it a few times but here it is anyway. 50x20 MM on 10% risk 10 levels. 250 stoploss I use a few different risk % settings for my different accounts a 12, 10, 6, 2. edit: forgot to add stoploss...

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Have you tried Bob's latest settings on this pair? 50/15, mult. 1.4, 10 levels, SL 180, trading .05 I traded it thur. am to fri. am and ended up almost $100.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
If you are not able to watch the charts all day long, how can you track the maximum drawdown of open trades? It would be interesting to know when trading multiple pairs.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I back tested and demoed it and didn't find it to my liking at all. I use the attached indicator on a 15 or 30 min chart to track the max drawdown.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Easy! Use MT4's built in publisher to auto-publish your trades and current stats to your website. I have mine updating every 5 minutes while live trading. It looks like this: http://www.frostcall.com/mt4 So, I can look at my trades no matter where I am as long as I have an internet connection. Granted, I can't really do much about them while away, but I can watch them. STEALTH EDIT- You will need to go to your templates folder and rename StatementDetailed.htm to statement.htm (after making backup copies of them both of course). Then use your favorite text editor to remove your account and name info. Then set your ftp settings for your website and BAM, you're rocking and rolling. I may offer up some free MT4 ftp hosting for folks in the future, but I will have to locking some things down first so people don't get all crazy at my expense.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Does AccountEquityAnalyzer send an email if you have email notifications enabled? I noticed there was a setting for MinutesScreenshotShoot Interval. I could publish like you recommend Frostcall, but that won't give me any historical data during the day if I cannot get to the Internet. If it could fire an email every hour, then I'd have some historical data to track. Thanks to both of you, Field

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Drawdown is my number ONE consideration using this system. How big of a drawdown there might be, and how often. As everyone is using different pairs, different settings and different lot sizes, I don't see a way to get a handle on it other than demoing it for quite awhile. My thought is to stay with the safer pairs and same settings of 100X80 and see what the results are at .01, 02, .03, etc. But, if you're gone from the computer, and the graph doesn't show the drawdown there was while you were gone, it's difficult to test.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
What didn't you like about the 50/15? Did you see more drawdown compared to the 50/20? I'm going to run both for the next month and decide which i like best. How would you back test that EA. Run the buy then the sell and then add the two? I run the same indicator to watch my drawdown. I'm still searching for an indicator that tracks maximum margin used. Have you seen anything like that? Thanks

--- 帖子 #435 ---
backtest always seems to margin call or not be profitable with 50/15. I don't know why... I haven't done a ton of testing, but I have for 50/20 and I find it to be profitable for me so that is what I use. I haven't seen any software like that, but I can tell you from experience a level 9 trade uses about 60$ in margin for me on 400:1 leverage. Edit: I must add that I actually keep my 50/20 running all the time while, I believe, bob closes his EA during normal times so that always is a factor in the differences of setting choices.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Putting current DD, potential DD and margin in use in the EA is a neat idea. I'll work on it.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Sorry to bother you again, what about lot size and multiplication?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
1.2x as far as lot size goes I have it set to 0.20, but it shouldn't matter because with MM enabled as your balance grows so does the amount of traded lots. That is the major difference between bob and I. He trades very small accounts with VERY high risk realtive to their size while I take on the more smooth equity curve approach taking out some money now and then, but mainly growing my account size. Both ways have their merits and I'm actually thinking about breaking down my high risk account into two small accounts using fixed lots and those will be my income accounts while I try to grow the other two. Haha, sorry to drag your answer out with my ramblings. edit: I've been thinking up more after every post lately... I don't want anyone here to think that they can just use the same settings as bob, me or anyone else live and expect the same results as us. I hate to say it, but we have some experience with this system and know when to close down trades and when not to trade moreso than someone who hasn't demoed. I'm not discouraging anyone away from the system/ea I'm just trying to say that with your luck you will go live with our setting and take a big hit thus wanting to put the blame on us. In trading we hate to admit our own faults. I, for one, know from personal experience what it feels like to want to blame others, but you are only going to take your trading to the next level when you can look yourself in the mirror and realize the real reason your trade didn't work out.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Here are my results trading 20 pairs at .10 lots, thats 10 cents a trade with IBFX. Made over 1000 dollars.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I agree with Verto. I talk with Bob a bit and I think we all agree that the system put forward here takes time to learn and master. However, I honestly feel that this system is the best one out there. Try not to get too confused about settings. Also, make sure you understand what your leverage is and what margin is. It's important to know what your lot sizes are and what they represent to you for each pip tick. Before you get too concerned with tweaking the system, learn the system and understand it (and the death trade). Once it all clicks and you 'get it', the tweaks make perfect sense. ForEx is not a get rich quick scheme. Take the time and effort to really understand what's going on, and always remember: Any profit is better than any loss. Any small loss is better than any large loss. Be happy with your wins and learn from your mistakes. Be honest with yourself.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I would like to ask for some pointers: - at what time/session do you guys start the 100/80? Always at fixed time? - do you close at fixed time each day or do you sometimes let it run longer? Im asking because I had very different results during demo testing; some pairs did not move outside 100 and some crazed over 300 (EURJPY), so did not know what to do.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
This would be a nice addition to these EA's. Can you program something that would show what the max. margin used was? Thank you FrostCall.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Good question but it has a major problem. If we knew when the market was going to move and how far and when we wouldnt need an EA and we all would get rich. The market moves when it moves. However, to give you the best answer I can. You start before a major session and there are 3. The JPY session, Euro session and the USA session. I live in China so I use the JPY session to open and many days close before the USA session. I do this not because of strategy but because those are my hours. The EA is designed to handle all but the most extreme moves of the market. But if you want to play the USA session it would be best to start the session with the full protection of the range of the EA and then if it runs all day in one direction, you can look to the JPY or EURO session for your retracement. If the USA session moves in one direction and then retraces during the afternoon then you close around the close of the USA session. However, after saying all that I design this EA to last all day within a 800 pip range. It is rare for any currency to go more than that.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
OK guys, my new EA I took home 900 dollars on in 4 weeks is posted here. See ya later. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post2369387

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi all, Been trading this for a few days now and everything is going great, except for one thing I've noticed. For some or other reason the EA seems to arbitrarily close some trades in the middle of nowhere, some for a small profit ro small loss. Can't really seem to find a pattern to it. Anybody else getting this?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
ive seen a little bit of this, who knows.... also eurjpy hit me hard during the sleep last night during the US session

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yes, I'm getting the same thing. I have stock settings of 100x80, but some trades are closed out at minus 50 pips, 57 pips, 35 pips. Glad you brought it up. Must be some sort of glitch in the EA.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
The EA is designed to close ALL trades when any of the other trades close. So, if one of the trades hit's a TakeProfit, it closes ALL trades. If one of the trades hits a Stop Loss, it closes ALL trades. So, in the example below, if the 100x80 was stretched to it's max of 10 trades, and the 10th trade made the retrace and hit the TakeProfit of 100 pips, you would have the following: Trade 0.01 -6.2 Trade 0.02 -10.8 Trade 0.04 -18.4 Trade 0.08 -30.4 etc... (See attached Image for the full count). The idea is that you are still making a profit when the largest one closes. Again, whenever any trade is closed, they all close. So, if YOU close a trade, the EA will automatically close all of the rest (so be careful with your interventions). Does this explain it?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Just to add more from the last post: The way this EA is designed, if you are 3 trades or more deep, then there will be at least 1 trade that closes in the negative. This is why the EA is designed to multiply each trade. As you can see from the Settings Finder, each new trade (level) is great enough to cover all of the negative trades and still make a profit. Try this out for yourself by changing the 'MaxTrades' setting from 1, to 2, to 3, to 4, to 5, to 6, to 7, to 8, to 9, then to 10. You will see that at each level, the final trade (or two or three trades) make up for all of the losses and you come out ahead. But whenever they close, there will always be negative trades if you are more than 3 trades (levels) deep. This is due to new trades opening every 80 pips. Simple math.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
It isn't a bug, its a feature. Sorry, I've always wanted to say that. haha, anyway... the EA is designed to close out all trades whenever one of the trades it closed. If you are more than 3 trades deep some will close in negative, that is the way it was designed.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Just thought I would let you know I tried a demo at 2000 dollars at .10 lots and it could not provide enough margin to handle 20 trades at once. I will be testing .05 next. I did successfully use 3000 dollars at .10 but 2000 doesnt have enough. If I drop the gbp/jpy it probably would have handled it but I love trading that beast. It is a great winner ........... er and loser too. I am off to Hong Kong this week so I wont be submitting any comments this week.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
my demo starting with $3000 trading dimes intially blew up this morning. The EURJPY ruined me overnight during the US session... got to like 6.4 mini lots deep.... im gonna try $1000 at pennies to replicate what i may start with live, then go to 0.02 once i hit $3000 then up 1cent every $1000

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Same here. As I reported in my thread, I got OWNED by the EURJPY. I'm down to around $70 in the account now. I'll probably keep this account going and testing it with some smaller settings and open a new one with a few grand to run the larger movers on.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thanks for your answer(s) Frost. Very impressed with this EA. Currently going .03 using 7 of the safer pairs. The account up almost $200.00 today with a $300.00 drawdown earlier. There was quite a bit of trending earlier, too, so the drawdown not that bad at all, considering. Thinking of going live, and putting a global stop of about $600.00 That way I won't get margined out even if there was a major trend going on.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
So far so good; EA with 12 pairs at lot=0.01 as specified in post 1 started on 6 Nov 2008 with $3K equity running continuously; Profit $1674 with Max DD 4.27%

--- 帖子 #456 ---
i hope thats live

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi all... This is a good system, but I think is only good with 12 pairs running... I tried 4 pairs and it was always on a lose... I tried 6 pairs the same. I tried 8 pairs the same. very interersting... no settings were changed... Cheers

--- 帖子 #458 ---
what 12 are they? im running 10.. cant remember them off the top of my head tho..

--- 帖子 #459 ---
each pair has its own EA n are independent ; its just how volatile the pair is ie whether it runs more than 800 pips range in a day

--- 帖子 #460 ---
each pair has a diferent EA? Is that right? Did not know that... I have only seen 1 EA for all pairs.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Yes, it is the same EA being used to attach to each pair, so each pair is running on its own; the behaviour of one pair does not affect the other; the only thing being affected is the account margin - the more pairs one use, and depending on the lot size chosen, the more equity you will need

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Oh ok... thats what I thought so... Cheers Fxseer

--- 帖子 #463 ---
This is an update from my weekly results reported last week. I was mistaken before. I thought I had 22 pairs but it was actually 17. Excluded all Canadian crosses. I'm running this 100x80 EA continously between Sunday and Friday and shut down over the weekends. Started with $5000 demo account at IBFX on 11/19. Results as of 11/28. Beginning Lot Size: .1 Multiplication Factor: 2 825 Pip SL According to the Account Equity Analyzer, maximum drawdown for the week was: $-1213.44 Ending Balance for the week: $11400.79 Attached is my graph.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
do you have to keep your comp on the whole time? electricity costs?

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Yes, the PC stays on 24/7. Not worried about electricity costs that will just be a cost of doing business. I want to push this EA to the limits and see what it can do. Then adjust accordingly with a real account. If we can manage the downsides, then I think we can make money with this EA. And like Bob does on his accounts, withdraw weekly amounts from the account to control risk. Get your initial deposit back asap. Then you are working with house money.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
yeh thats what im gonna do, get your intial money out asap, gives you plenty of peace of mind. Im jsut curious how you keep the comp 'alive' if say for example theres a storm and you get a blackout or if you ever get a dreaded 'bluescreen of death'

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I have battery backup but if you lose your internet connection the orders are placed with TP and stop loss so every time it hits a TP it will close the trade. However, since the EA is not operating the trades it will no longer reenter any more positions and it only closes the trades it hits the TP on. I had this happen one time and it made quite a bit of money for me because: 1. It did not hit any stop losses. 2. When it hits a TP it only closes that one trade not all of them like the EA does. 3. Every level hit the 100 TP so it was always making the maximum profit and on that day it did it both ways and on many pairs. 4. It was one of my better days.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
i see, i was curious if it hit one TP if they would all close like the EA. Atleast with the SL and good risk managment we will know a worst case scenario.... whats it like for a battery power backup?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
The other option is to get a dedicated server at a hosting company that provides access to the console through Remote Desktop Connection (or Terminal Services). Costs run from $75 per month and up depending on the specs of the machine. You don't need a lot of hard drive storage space, just a nice amount of RAM and a good processor. That will give you 99.999 % guaranteed uptime.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
It's just too bad that Windows can't promise that...

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Have anyone experienced launching as per post #1 12 pairs (24 charts) and seeing metatrader freeze up? Any idea what is the reason? I have to kill the program, relaunch it many times before it finally works. I am using the latest build and the EA has been compiled with the latest build.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
You need a newer and better computer is all. I finally found that out myself.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Ok, here's an update on trading 17 pairs with a starting lot of .1, 12 levels multiplyer of 2. Running continously from Sunday evening. The GBP/JPN reached 9 levels which put it at 25.60 lots. The price continued down but because the multiplication factor was set at 2, that was more than 50 lots which IBFX has a limit at 50. So, when the 10th level trade could not be entered, seems that all the lots closed. The Stop Loss for the first trade was 138.15 and the price had not yet reached that point so, I don't that that's what triggered all the trades to close. The GBP/CHF had reached 8 levels, so maybe it was a combination of both that caused a margin call. Anyhow, we see what can happen with too much risk. After trading the GBP/JPN for over a year, you think you know how it's going to behave and you believe it's going to retrace at least 100 pips which would have put me in profit. Today was one of those days that it moved over 800 pips. Going to cut # of lots to .05 and limit to 8 levels deep and start over to see what happens. Anybody else trying this many pairs on a 100x80 EA? What are your settings/results?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Yes I have been testing the same thing and I have decided to drop the GBP pairs before I go live trading. They have death traded this system 3 times now in the last 6 weeks and I feel the risk is too great to use them. Other than that I found the 100/80 profitable. I am doing one more test without the GBP and if it successfull I will do 1-2000 anywhere from .02-.05 depending on how my final tests go. I may also tweak the numbers a little first.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Yeah, that's pretty bad. I'm running MT4 in a virtual computer using VMWare on an iMac and I can easily run much more than that. Remember, a new computer is an investment!

--- 帖子 #476 ---
and tax deductible and gets depreciated

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Have used the 100X80 for the past two weeks at .03 with minimal drawdown, even on days the market goes down 600 points, so going live using 8 of the safer pairs.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Why you dont buy some hosting ? ? ? I have and its best solution. 20 USD monthly and im not worried i blow up my Pc or have huge electricity bills.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi, could someone point me to the safest pairs please, I have used this on GBP/USD with some success (demo) however I would like to try more pairs, maybe 5 ? thanks, Steve.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Which one do you use at $20.00 a month? Is it easy to set up?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
where or how do you get such hosting?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
have a look at bobs 7 year fact sheet (its an attachment) it shows you how big the moves have been in different currencies and the amount of times it occurs

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Steve, whitegoodman is correct. On my demo account, I've been trading .03 for the past few weeks with very little drawdown on 7 pairs, and thgere have been some fairly wild swings in the market since then. The pairs are: CHF/JPY, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, EUR/CHF, NZD/USD, EUR/USD, USD/CHF. As of a few moments ago, I went live with these pairs at .03 each.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
thanks both, I will demo those, do they all use the same settings? I will find the factsheet, must have missed it earlier. Steve.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Arnold, at the top right, click on the list of attatchments and the 7 year fact sheet is there. As far as them using the same settings, yes they do, if you're talking about the 100X80 EA. One thing you should know is that one of the SELL EAs doesn't work. It's the one that trades .01, and I recommend you use the EA that trades .02, and just change it to .01 or whatever amount you want to demo trade. Also, if you haven't you should study the entire thread.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I have read the whole thread, and have used the EA's on GBP/USD, never really had any probs, only when using several currencies, so I wanted to try the "safest" ones. I've now looked at the factsheet, thanks for your help. Steve.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
seems strange however, that they will all use the same settings,as they must have different characteristics. EUR/GBP will not retrace as far as the least safe one will. we could do with a way to work out average retracement values and adjust the EA accordingly, I will see if that is possible to do in Excel. Steve.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
That would be a good question for nanningbob or Frostcall.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
well how did the 7 year fact sheet get done? (manually?)... im thinking someones gonna have to do it manually to see what we can get on different pairs in terms of range and avg retracement etc...

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi Bob, I've been having mixed results with this EA the past week or so. It started off great (up over 35% in the 1st 2 weeks). The past week or so has been around break-even. I discovered I was using a Standard account, so I opened a new mini demo account and began trading it the past week or so. So far it has a net loss for the week. I've been trading 5 pairs (AUD/NZD, CHF/JPY, EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY) in the both of these demo accounts . Meanwhile my 35x20 AUD/NZD EA is doing great. From what I'm reading, some others have had much better results the past week with the 100x80. Is there something wrong with my setup or the pairs I'm trading? Obviously somethings wrong. Thanks for your help. Anthony

--- 帖子 #491 ---
theres a lot of variables such as how long do you let it run? do you let it go in the US session? currency pairs and lot size are the major ones i think... experiment with more oir different currency pairs perhaps

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I like trading as many pairs as possible because I seem to get the best results over the long term that way. I have so far had steady results as long as I stay away from the pairs I mentioned in the first post. I also like to wait for the retracement and close out almost every day. Some currencies wont retrace the full 100 points but will retrace enough to make a small profit. I go strictly by overall + - for the entire group not individual pairs. So today I see my balance is up 228 dollars and my negative carry is 58. I take the 170 profit and start he EA over again. This way I keep the full range of the EA in play. Slower pairs can go over 800 points with out a retracement of 100 but it takes several days for them to do it. If you just keep it running you will eventually run into this problem. The other side of the equation is there are no real set rules. There is no indicator or time frame that says "market retraces every day at 3" The market goes in some direction every day and sometime during the day it will retrace. Very very rarely will it just go in one direction all day. Even if 1 or 2 currencies do the others wont. Now the most common times for retracement are the afternoon USA session or the JPY session. Sometimes the middle of the Euro session will retrace. You just never know. I try to take whatever the market gives me that day. The one thought that kills traders and makes them lose money is: I have got to make xx.xx amount of money every day or I made 500 yesterday I want to do it again today. That is very bad thinking. Some days this EA has given me 30 dollars and some days 900. You have to be satisfied with what the market gives you on a day by day basis. What you want is long term steady growth. You see your balance bigger than the carrying deficit and check the time of day, (do you think there maybe more). I tend to close most often before the USA session but if I dont have my retracement I will wait all the way through to the next day on others. I like to play the JPY session because it goes one way and the Euro session usually changes and goes the other. Does it always do that, no but many days it will. Those that have been around my posts know that is my favorite way to trade. I also have been testing starting the USA session and close during the JPY retracement. That is also proving profitable. So test an idea out and let it ride.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I don't mind if I don't make a certain profit EVERY day. Even if I have an entire week of small losses, like I just did. My concern is that my results are different that everyone elses, so I'm thinking I have something wrong with my setup or the pairs I'm using. I'm in the US EST, so I typically open the EA when I get to work (around the US open), close it out when I leave work (around the US close), reopen it when I get home (around the JPY open) and let it run all night. I close everything when I leave for work (before the US open). I haven't had any one session have a huge loss. Although considering that the AUD/NZD EA is performing well (using the same start and closing times I mentioned above), it means that the other pairs are losing significant money, since my overall result for the week is a loss. It just seems that all sessions have had very little activity for me during the past week and each session it trades, it losses small amounts of money. Perhaps it's the pairs I'm using. Would you mind sharing the pairs you are currently using with the EA? Thanks for you help. Anthony

I am trading 17 pairs, from AUD crosses jpy, usd, nzd, cad, chf from CHF/JPY from EUR crosses chf,usd,jpy,gbp,cad from NZD crosses jpy,chf,usd from GBP/USD from USD crosses jpy, chf From the above group the ones that could give you trouble are the Eur/jpy, GBP/USD and maybe aud/jpy. I do not trade GBP/JPY, GBP/CHF, GBP/NZD, USD/CAD, EUR/AUD these have all gotten me into trouble too often. At present I am only going 8 levels deep or 6-700 points. Going deeper is using numbers I would never trade with, meaning I would not use enough money to cover that kind of depth. When I demo trade I trade like I would live. However, to learn how an EA or system works I will use large money accounts to see how deep the negatives will go. I notice you are closing twice a day as a set schedule. That may not work best because the market does not neccesarily move or retrace in those time frames. The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have the full range of the EA at the USA market open but other times it should handle any moves of the market. Try to learn to close at the retracements not a set time every day. If you are not deep in the hole keep the EA running or just close out and restart the currencies that are 3-4 or more levels deep. I had one day in which all the currencies were 1 or 2 levels deep and two others were at level 5. Instead of taking the whole loss I just closed out the 2 currrencies that were deep and minimized my loss for that period. I went on to have a good day. Closing those 2 kept me from facing any big losses for the day.

I have noticed that mostly what bob and I talk about here as well as the other thread is closing out trades. I notice alot of people asking about settings and etc. but it seems like almost everyday or at least once a week I come back to posting 'closing out blah blah' keeps your from trouble. I really can't stress this enough I guess. With this system/ea it is all about the EXITS. A good example is one that puts you behind the wheel of a car on the freeway. When you first started driving you got into the exit lane MILES from the exit because you were stressed out about missing it. As you become a more experience driver you start to relax and drive more natrually. Trading any system is all about the experience.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thank you for your insight, Bob. Basically I open and close the EA according to when I go to and come from work (I'm using a work laptop). I opened and closed the US session in an effort to try to isolate how the EA reacts during that time period. I'm also opening and closing the 35x20 during the same times, but so far, it's been working great. I'm up over 11% in a week. Do you think closing twice a day is a problem for that EA as well?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
No I just do it once a day. I will normally avoid the USA session with that one but not always.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
arnold49 brought up the point that different pairs have different characteristics. For instance, the 35X20 EA works better for the AUD/NZD than 100X80 would. He was going to try to do a spreadsheet. Is there any easy way to determine what might be better for eah pair?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I've looked into doing this in excel but it is a bit daunting, so I will try simply running the two EAs, one at a time thru the strategy tester and try to find optimal settings for each, I'll look into this when I get home tonight. Steve.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Thanks, Steve. I'm not real sure it could be done, except maybe for some broad results, since the market changes. I know that nanningbob had other threads with differing settings, and that he has done lots of testing and research.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
might be an idea to just test the last six month of data, and reoptimise every month, that way you can keep on top of market changes? Steve.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
perhaps when nanningbob has some time, he can shed more light on this? What I'm now doing is using both EAs on one account. I use the 35X20 EA for the AUD/NZD at .10, and the 100X80 on seven other of the safer pairs at .03 each. So far, the AUD/NZD has been a stellar performer. The other pairs have been slow, but also a slight increase in the account, which I don't complain about. If there were more optimal settings on a certain pair, I could simply change the EA settings for that pair.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Remember you are testing one at .03 and the other at .10 so the .10 has an advantage. Try both at .03 and the profitability would be much closer. My philosophy on this is this. An EA needs to cover the possible range of a currency. For instance the Eur/GBP biggest day ever was around 350 points. An EA that can cover 400 points has the odds of never wiping out in theory The gbp/jpy biggest day is around 1800, however, making a practical EA of 1800 range is not reasonable, unless you have 20,000 or more to play with. So now you do a risk and reward study. If you take my 7 year currency fact sheet, you can see there are only 4 or 5 currencies that will travel over 700 points in one day more than once a year. That leaves you with 15 that you could play with and be reasonably sure your safe with an EA that covers 6-700 pip moves. There are 8 currencies that almost never go over 400 in one day so you can write up an EA for them. The 7 year fact sheet and Frostcall's excel program you can get very good at coming up with settings for an EA and what currencies to use them on. What I love about this system is brokers and banks cant really defeat it easily. If the ranges on your EA is right they would need a record day to defeat it. The 100x80 and the 35x20 are the same EA and system just the numbers are different. The 35x20 has a range of less than 200 points, the only reason it works is because of the unique bouncing of the AUD/NZD. Its usage with other currencies is limited. The 100x80 can be used with a lot of currencies but the amount of funds to run it is a lot more. Take 5000 dollars, set the 100x80 on dimes and OH BOY. You could make a living on it but the 35x20 is just nice PT income. Since most of us dont have 5000 to lose but 500 is more comfortable we like the 35x20. The 100x80 hmmmmmmmm I am getting tempted to try it if I think I can run it with certain pairs and 2000. I am in my final weeks of testing on a demo with those figures at .05 lots. It would make more than the 35x20.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
That was a GREAT explanation of your EA and philosophy, and the time you tool to explain is greatly appreciated. Someone with a large enough account could make a great income using the either of these EAs. I'm not rich, but I have bee3n thinking of exactly what you were saying....going .10 on several pairs or more. Right now, am going .03, and on a live account, and want to see what happens. VERRRRYYY slow day today. But, I've seen when it heats up what just .03 can do. And, i know that going a "dime" makes it exponentially more, so I won't go there until I see more. It's real easy to increase in stages. I can go .04, then .05, etc. The EA is great!

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Thanks, I am doing very well for the contest. I think when the first results come out I should be in the top 10. My other live account is doing well also and I exspect to take another 3-500 check depending how I do in the next two days.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I hope you WIN the contest! In thinking of what you posted, I was stopped on the EUR/GBP when I used it on the 35X20 EA with a 200 pip stop, when a few days ago, it went 291 pips with hardly any retrace. If someone really wants to optimize an EA for each pair, they would have to set a stop on this pair of about 400. On the other pairs, it would be something higher than say maybe the last several highs. Certainly no expert on this system, but the higher the stop you set, the more risk entailed on each pair, because getting stopped at such high levels would be a killer. So, perhaps using an average like you do, such as 100X80 kind of evens things out. I suppose if someone wanted to REALLY get down to the nitty gritty, maybe 109X76 might be the optimum? (Just kidding!)

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I should proofread my posts before submitting them. I meant to say that for each pair, you'd have to set separate stops, and your stop of 800 as an average is probably a very good stop on "most" pairs as an average.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I enjoyed reading that, stop losses in my system are only for account salvage. We hope that the SL never gets hit but we know that occasionally that will happen. In reality you want to step in and end a bad long before that or close out everyday and not face the death trade or stop loss. I try to find a retracement that minimizes my losses and get out rather than wait for a stop loss. Once you get the feel or knowledge of when to close out a bad trade that is when these EAs really become profitable. That takes some time to learn however.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Nanningbob, I notice you mention the largest daily range for a currency being 800 pips(for example) over a 7 year period. What happens if the currency continues in the same direction the next day without a pull back? When a currency has one of these big days wouldn't you have to look at the next day to see just how far it went. And regarding the size of the pullback. If the orders are 80 pips apart with a 100 take profit its possible that with a pull back of 170 pips still no take profit would be achieved, it just depends where the pull back starts relative to your last order. If the price was 75 pips below your last buy and then started to retrace it would have to go 175 pips to take profit, I think a lot of people don't realise this. Regardless I am checking your posts everyday and running my own demo, thanks very much!

--- 帖子 #510 ---
this is true quite often it retraces 100 pips but if your 80 pip renetry wasnt on the very top of the retracement you wont acheive it.... thats why its a semi automatic system so to speak..

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Yes this is true. I have stated in the past that fact. I have said that some currencies will take several days to reach the death trade. I have recommended several times closing at a profit at the retrace stating some currencies will not do a full retrace. You restart to get the full protection of the EA especially before the USA open.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
The 100x80 using it on 17 pairs at .05 lots. Started with 2000 opening balance with no trade going over 5 levels all week. I did close my EA 2 times during the week, thats all the trades at once. I also am experimenting with closing only those currencies level 3 or higher at the USA open so I dont take as big of a deficit bite then. So far that strategy has worked out very well.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Many Thanks for this great system, Bob. I never realised some great system developer showing the magic in this Rookie section. hoho. I hope that I can contribute something to your system. My thought is on the exits, if it is a concern. I'd make such a systematic StopLoss. Your system assumes "range trading", so we could go back history to find some ranging days, say eurusd in 2006? (i'm at work, can't go into data/history precisely now)...... just a rough thought: run backtest, then MT4 present an equity chart, the chart should show a stable rising curve (because of your ranging trading), visually measure the increasing balance curve's slope, or carefully calculate the slope [ easy, (delta Profit) / (delta time) ]. This is job 1. Job 2 is to find during 2008 Sept ~ Nov, these days, how often approximately your EA run into a terrible drawdown or those 'death' days. say roughly, every 5 days (1 week), or every 10 days. let's assume it is 5 days. then the stoploss works like this: if the equity curve's slope for previous 5 days drops for 50% (the number of 50% needs to be optimized/sensitivity analyzed), then now it is bad for the EA ---- time to stoploss. I could expect more loss, more smaller drawdown, slower equity increase, but less trader's pain to inspect/mental SixFlag/manually stoploss. again, I'm still studying your system in early stage. hopefully you are not upset after reading my potentially useless post. I have not read the end of these threads. I am reading posts during Oct/Nov. Maybe you guys already have a very good StopLoss method. so just ignore mine.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Very nice gain Bob. Thanks again for sharing your work.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Thank you for your research. I find backtesting of very little value. Since we often close out the EA and restart it and also you never want to run the EA over the weekend (price gaps too much and ruins the reentry) you cant do those type of things with a backtest. So the results you get from backtesting simply are not that accurate. There is no way to know how many people have actually developed good EAs but they throw them out because of backtesting results. They dont realize how inaccurate the information you get back is. To prove my statement look at how many companies sell their EAs because of great back test information but when you put them live they turn out to be dogs. I use back testing to see if my EA works but Frost Calls excel program and my 7 year currency facts will give you a much better idea of how a currency pair will act in an EA than a back test will.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Nice graph Bob - Do you know what your biggest DD was? Last week I ran 100x80 6 safest pairs starting .05 24/5 - made $355 largest DD $310. I want to go-live with this one, but currently find $300+ DD too much to bear, so this week I ran it 24/5 starting with 0.02 - it made $53 with largest DD $61 I guess some weeks are gonna be big and others small.....just need to find a happy risk threshold..... Next week I will demo both 17 pairs and 6 pairs, both starting at 0.02 and see what that brings.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
To me having enough money to cover a DD is more important to me than the DD. I dont mind DD because the bigger the DD the bigger the profit when the market retraces. What I find important is how many levels deep does it go. If I play an EA that can go 8 levels deep but it never goes there, then I never hit my stop loss. I want to use currencies that dont test the limits of the EA. If I have that, then it is just figuring out how deep can I go with my account and not get into trouble with margin. If I can trade 1000 with .02 lots then that is ideal. If my DD hits 3-400 I know my profits will be good. My whole theory is based that almost all currencies will retrace every single day. The one or two that dont are offset by the profits of the others. Maybe some days I will take a loss but it wont damage my account too severly. You will never have a perfect world but you want to make money, get your original investment out and then the DD doesnt bother me. The only real problem I see with any of my EAs is that market conditions right now can change drastically and suddenly. All it takes is for Bernanke or Trichet to say something and the market will go bonkers moving 500-1500 pips with some of these currencies. Those two scare me more than anything else that happens in the market.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
How can you tell what is a safe currency to trade? Here is a 80 MA with lines + - every 100 pips. If my EA will cover a 600 pip range and from red line to red line is 600 pips then if price stays inside the red lines you are always safe. This is a good way to measure which currencies are safest to trade with the 100x80. You can put this on a 1H chart to see how safe a currency is to trade day by day. You can put it on a 4H chart to see which currencies are safe to trade week by week. In other words which currencies can I turn this on on Monday and never turn the EA off and what currencies do I need to monitor every day and possibly restart the EA during a 24 hour period. IF your DD looks bad you can use this to see if certain currencies are out of range or not. I hope this new tool helps you. Put the template in your templates folder and attach it to any screen pair.I have replaced my sell screen EA with this one. I think it is a better tool than the one I had. The pick below is the usd sgd which I am adding to my list of tradeable currencies with this system. Notice that this is a 4H chart and the distance from each dotted line is 1W. I could turn this EA on and let it run all week on this pair and it stays inside the red lines. Also attached is the template. MA 80 blank, no EA is attached to this template. If you want to use it you must drag the EA on and then save it to a new template.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Here is a pic of the aud/chf. On a 4H chart it is not safe to trade all week with out resetting the EA. If you restart your EA every day you can see the from the 1H chart it will push the EA to its limit. If you wanted to trade this pair you know you have to have a restart sometime during any 24 hour period to keep your account safe. The 4H is first the 1H is second. Hope this improves your trading decisions.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Thank you very much, This will indeed help.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
This leaves me somewhat baffled: isnt 100*80 hardwired to daily TF like 100*40 d1? Or it uses TF of the chart it is attached to? Thnx

--- 帖子 #522 ---
100x80 is meant to trade both directions at the same time. It isn't hardwired to any one direction. At any time it should have buys and sells open because you run the buy EA on one chart and sell EA on the other.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
This is the first sentence of my post: How can you tell what is a safe currency to trade? I dont understand your question?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Thnx, I re-read the thread and found answer, sorry for confusion.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Please anyone!!! And Thanks to Bob. I have been using 100x80 on real account since last month, I have an idea if we could have buy limit and sell limit with "Grid Size" setting, I mean , for example we only open a sell limit position above 100 pips each grid size, not when we just start the EA there will be 2 open sell and buy position almost at the same time. I have PM Bob, since he is busy I hope anyone could have coded this attched EA to become a Grid Style 100x80 I attach here is the Grid Monster EA, I think we just need to Add some code and make it Martingle/Pyramid/Double lot function enable!!! It could be good EA. Hope Bod could do me a favor how to code it. Thanks alot

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Checking your account and currency history is vital to your success. It is often I will close sometime everyday so as to prevent this problem. I am working on a trade theory that has been very successful for two weeks and is a variation of this. It works great with the 100x80, at least so far, and addresses some of this. BIG NOTE: Being profitable with this system does not always mean you wait for it to hit the 100 pip profit. If it has banked 200 dollars and the market retraces so your deficit is 75 dollars you close all for 125 dollar profit. That is how I originally set this EA up. (I am trading 18 pairs) You take every day or 2 days what the market gives you. This is how I trade this. Because we have had a slower week I have only closed all once this week. The currencies are ranging so there has been no need to do daily closes. I have not had one currency go over 4 levels deep. I will write more this weekend on how I am doing that.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
NanningBob, would like to know your assessment of increasing trade sizes with increasing account equity. I mean, with 100*40, I successfully took demo 5000 standard account to 10000, then increased to 0.02 and I am taking it to 20000 (rising steadily). Then I plan to put in 0.03 and take it to 40000. -What is your assessment of this strategy? -If I do this live, how do you think broker would react? You think its safer to keep below 25000 threshold (this is IBFX limit for mini accounts, as far as I know)? -Would you rather manage more small &lt;5000 accounts and extract money on a constant basis and so keep a low profile? thnx

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I have never had problems with IBFX but I have not used these sums of money either. I think that sounds good but the best way to check is to use Frost Calls excel program.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Just want to be sure of what you're saying. As you're on a standard demo account, you're going the equivalent of twenty cents on a mini account? Also, what pairs are you using? Thanks. I'm using .03 on a $4,000.00 live account on 7 of the safest pairs. Highest drawdown about $300.00.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Paradox, basically the answer is yes; just to be safe i explain: On mini: - demo mini account with 500$ starts with 0.01 start position (value 1 cent) if i want same risk proportions on standard, I multiply base capital *10, start lot size stays 0.01, and because of standard account this it is automatically multiplied by 10 and so: - demo standard account starts with 5000$ with 0.01 start position (value 10 cents) If I do like that, risk and probabilities are the same, only money numbers are ten times greater. My basic question basically revolved around keeping low profile with my accounts, so I can milk the broker and not reach a certain threshold, where large lots and postitions would attract attention. That is also why I little modified EA code to delete comments from sent orders. Am not familiar with FrostCall Excel, will look and study, thank you for pointer. If I understand this matter, EA user must balance margin usage against equity and so be careful with rising lot sizes. EDIT: 100*40 live running on AUDCAD, AUDUSD, AUDJPY, EURCHF, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD, NZDUSD, USDCHF, USDJPY, CHFJPY The big winners with hitting the TP in last 4 weeks are GBPUSD, AUDUSD and AUDCAD, runner-ups are EURCHF, EURUSD and EURJPY. The worst pairs performed are NZDUSD (no TP hits) and USDJPY (one TP hit). Will ditch two worst pairs if performance in next weeks is not improved.

finder 3 was posted nov. 20 and someone updated it and posted it in the aud/nzd in the last 24 hours

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Looking forward to learn how u would trade 100x80. I got burn several times on trading AUDNZD alone. I'll switch to 100x80 next week and hope i could make a recovery. What's ur profit trading 100x80 this week ?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Up 1400 in two weeks trading .05 lots on 2000 dollars. In a bit of a jam right now but we will see how this news will run and how the EA handles it. The account has gone 780 in the whole which is the biggest DD so far. The market is retracing so I will look for an exit. Actually the only trade that is in trouble is the EUR/USD. It is in its 4th day without a retracement and has hit level 7. I am only playing 8 levels so I need any kind of retracement to lessen my loss. I will bail out of it and see how the others will run.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
0.05 lot is a bit of a big leverage for a $2000 account and there is potential of getting a margin call. But now ur account is up to $3000+, it shouldn't be a problem. I think it's better to trade 0.03 lot on $2000 and change to 0.05 lot when reach $3000.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I agree, when I go live I will start at .02 or .03 but I like using a bigger number when I demo to see if it will overwhelm the amount used. If it survives .05 at 2000 then I feel good about using .02 or .03 with 2000. I always test with my demo what I want to do live just to see if it feasible. I also try to trade it like it is live. I want the real feel before the real thing.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
So the account which up +1400 from 2000 is demo account ?

--- 帖子 #537 ---
The DD for level 7 is around $400 and level 8 is double $800 [for 0.02 lot]. Since there is no enough money to go level 10 which need around $3000, maybe we should change the setting of 100x80 to be max trade level 7 and set SL to 800 which will bring the loss to $1000. The SL is there only to give us time to exit ourselves. The advantage of changing max trade level 7 SL 800 is that we can afford to use more lot thus increase our profit since most of the time trades are level 5 and below. I don't see a point having max trade @ level 10 since we can't affort level 10 DD and we don't intend to go there. It's like telling the EA "hey, stop adding money when level 7. I'll take it from there" I was think of max trade 5 using 0.1 lot for $2000 account SL @ 800 (For emergency). When max trade is reached, we will look for exit. What do u think about this 2 other method of trading 100x80 ? Both of them is trying to increase lot size so as to earn more from lower level and not having to blow up account.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Ok I think I have a successful way of trading the 100x80 for almost any market. Does not mean you will profit every single day but it will keep you out of disaster trades and keeps the losses under a manageable control. For those of you that have followed me I thank you. Some of you have written me personal notes and I hope to make not only my life a little better but yours also. I think this will work under any market conditions and with 1500-2000 minimum this will work. First let me show you the chart and then I will tell you how I did it.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
already getting excited i shall call this account 4

--- 帖子 #540 ---
First you notice that the two weeks were slow steady and smooth. Not much up and down action. Then you see Thursday night and Friday's excitement. Yet we kept the account under control. The settings first: 100TP, reenter 80, Levels 8, stop loss set at 650, lots .05. Started the account at 2000 dollars and closed with a 1143 profit. That is 57% increase over 2 weeks or around 570 week. I could deal with that. Here is the basic philosophy. 1. pairs traded. From my 7 year currency fact sheet I only traded pairs that went over 700 points less than 5 times. Those were AUD-CAD,CHF,USD, NZD, CHF/JPY EUR-CAD,USD,CHF,GBP GBP/USD NZD-USD,JPY,CHF USD-CAD,CHF,JPY,SGD 17 pairs plus I decided to choose one risk pair from aud/jpy, gbp/chf, eur/jpy and I chose eur/jpy first week, aud/jpy second week. Dont ask me why I just did :nerd: Total 18 pairs. Of this group the ones that could give the most trouble if ever would be: gbp/usd, aud/chf, aud/jpy The rest will pretty much behave them selves under all market conditions. I donot recommend under any conditions the following pairs: eur/aud, gbp/jpy, gbp/nzd, or more than one risk pair.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
2. I decided to go the full 2.0 multiplication level so the levels would be easy to read and understand what was happening. The levels are LEVEL 1-.05, L2-.10, L3-.20, L4-.40, L5-.80, L6-1.6, L7-3.2, L8-6.4 3. I also decided I was not going to do daily shutdowns but individual shutdowns instead based on certain criteria. However, in week 1 when it was advantageous I closed all twice and the second week twice. Once in the middle of the week and of course always on Friday. 4. HERE ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT RULES You dont give a rip what currencies are doing the first 4 levels but when one hits level 5 .80 you go into action. A. THE NAME OF THIS GAME IS TO NEVER LET A CURRENCY GO TO LEVEL 7. You will do your best to get a good exit out of the trade for a profit or a minimal loss. YOU LOOK FOR THE BEST SMALL LOSS SCENARIO AND TAKE IT. B. NEVER LET ANY CURRENCY GO INTO THE USA SESSION AT LEVEL 4 OR HIGHER unless it was an extremely low risk pair. Close that baby before the USA open and be safe. The gbp/usd, aud/jpy, eur/jpy, aud/chf, I didnt care what loss I took I was not going into the USA session without my full 6-700 cushion. During this 2 week test of this method I tried and succeeded in never taking a loss bigger than 100 dollars. From the time a currency hits level 4 until it goes to level 7 you have 240 pips to find this solution. I actually looked at this like playing a computer game and started having fun with it.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
5. Why does this work?? Because I am only dealing with 1-3 currencies at any time. The others were too busy bouncing around their normal 3-400 pip range and would be making money for me. Almost every currency moves at least a 100 points every day meaning I was almost guarenteed 18 or more profit trades plus any retracements when they happened. Now the only thing I had to do was protect them from the big hit. As I began taking out potential lethal trades the rest of them just kept making me money. I wasnt afraid to take the loss. What it lead to was a nice continuous ride up and no sweating the deep level trades or DD. Going out to dinner, two currencies at level 4. BYE BYE. Nothing over 2 or 3, no problem be back in a couple of hours and check in on how you are doing. Come back, had one at level 5 and two at 4 but had pocketed 75 dollars while I was out. Looked out for my best exit for those two and then went to bed.

Here is my play on the EUR/USD that went 6 levels deep. It had a nice run up during the USA session so I wanted out before the euro session opened. That gave me about 8 hours to deal with it. Notice the pic below. LETTER A was the start of a 600+ run without a major retracement for the next 4 days. LETTER B-I did my all close, at that time I did not realize it but I cut off 150 pips of that run and made my Friday easier. The red arrow is where the Euro started its run on my dime. LETTER C-After a big Thursday run up I wake up to a fairly big DD (22% of my account) but only the Aud/jpy and Eur/usd look troublesome. The Aud/jpy made a nice retrace and profit during the jpy session. The Eur did not so I look to bail out. Letter D- You can see the blue support line it had hit 4 or 5 times. I realized it may not break that line so when it gets close. I close for a 60 dollar loss and am free and clear from that trade.

USDSGD ? I think it can be a good choice since Singapore government keep their currency in a trading band. That's their money policy lvl 8 cover 640 pips and it will hit SL very quickly since 650 include spread.max trade lvl 7 seem more reasonable ?

--- 帖子 #545 ---
As you probably already know Friday was a difficult day to trade. I made a total of 7 dollars today. You can see where I was trying to close bad trades and make a profit but it ended up breaking even. With the big news of the failed auto bailout I did not want to play the USA market so I bailed out as best as I could. Here is my pic of Friday so you can see my taking losses but keeping the account safe and no big loss at all. Just a teeny profit.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
So in conclusion, I add this for your thoughts. Lets avoid the big loss altogether and have a point where we are going to bail out with a minimum loss and trade to lose. We control the losers the winners will take care of themselves. I hope you can understand what I am trying to show.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
nanningbob, in addition. I think a rule of thumb for this trading method could be to close all trade on Wed before GMT+0 22:00 and reopen after GMT+0 22:00 (maybe reopen on Thur GMT+0 0:00) to prevent getting charge triple swap rate. Having so many trade could result in paying a lot of money into the swap rate.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Nice work Bob, and well thought. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Yeah your right, no need to have level 8, will just add to your losses. Actually level 8 hits at 560 level1 starts at 0. level2 at 80 and so on. I dont want to get to level 8 ever.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Good idea, check with your broker on their swap rate policy and act accordingly.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
yeah. DD of lvl 8 is $1000 more than lvl 7, paying $1000 for 1 level is expensive.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
IBFX is GMT+0 22:00. I always close my trade an hour before triple swap rate when i was using AUDNZD system. But 100x80 is not possible to close within 1 h without losing more money. I think on Wed should start to look for chance to close on start of USA session.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
i'll go live next week with the things u recommended here. Will practice with 0.02 lot before going for 0.05 lot. I'll stay with this system until AUDNZD goes back to 11 spread [go back to trade AUDNZD system] or i blow up my account.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
your so wise Bob your like a miniature buddha covered in hair... btw those moving average lines are they the same as the ones for the audnzd charts?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
NO, moving average lines are 150 pips apart for 100x80 and 50 pips apart for the aud/nzd.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I may keep level 8 because when I go live I will start at .01 or .02, by the time I have experienced this enough to try .05 I probably wont need level 8. I dont want to go there either.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
When do u plan to go live on this ?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I am putting 1000 into one of my live accounts to trade it so when it deposits Monday I will go live. I already have 500 there. I also am not going to enter the market Monday until I see what news stories happen. The last time a bailout got turned down the next Monday went nutso so I will be more cautious this time. I am going to start with .01 and see what happens. I know the profit wont be much but I want to get a live feel of this thing.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thanks Bob, yourSELF doing wonderful job! I am sure I will be benefited by your work. Is it possible to trade this with $500 if I start with 0.01 lot and just 10 pairs? Is it possible for you to pick best 10 from the 18 you mentioned earlier?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Only if you have 400:1 leverage. I think it will work. The only problem I have had with 500 or lower sums is if you hit a loss right away you dont have enough margin. you have to come out of the box with some winners.

How about the 10 safest pairs so lets do this by elimination Aud/jpy and Eur/jpy because they are risk pairs Eur/gbp because it has high margin usage Aud/nzd because of high spreads Gbp/Usd because of recent volatility Aud/chf because it is a new pair and has shown volatility during its short time of being used. NZD/USD because twice it has done spikes of over 1500 pips That leaves us with 12 pairs left from my list. I will let you choose which 2 you dont want to use from the 12 left. AUD-CAD,USD, CHF/JPY EUR-CAD,USD,CHF NZD-JPY,CHF USD-CAD,CHF,JPY,SGD I decided I will start with these same 12 pairs and .02 to start at 1000 @ 400:1. I will be conservative and trade the same risk as your 500 @ .01

GBPUSD looks good because of recent volatility. It's ranging very well if u look at the past months. If u compare EURUSD and GBPUSD which one is worst ? Aud/nzd and Aud/chf also range very well for the past months. IMO, EURGBP shouldn't be added into any list because it's moving slow and nowadays it tend to trend. Which means becoz of the slow movement it doesn't have enough pips when retrench for TP and it goes back to trend another day. USDSGD might also have the same problem with EURGBP. USDSGD also has the potential problem of not enough retrench for TP. One point we must take note is that we shouldn't take those pair which has too little volatility becoz it will not move enough for TP and u end up waiting for it to trend

--- 帖子 #565 ---
The last time I used the GBP/USD live it kicked my butt. I will wait yet longer before using that pair. I want to see some economic recovery there so we dont get any more sudden dives.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
IMO, there is no such thing as safest pair to trade. It could be safe now but the next day it's not. The problem with safest pair is that u don't know when it will happen that it's not longer safe. The strategy here is to earn TP as much as possible for coming trades that u wanna close with a loss. Hopefully, ur TP is much more than the loss and u end up in profit. Sometimes is the safest pair that give u the loss and u have to use the profit from the "not" safest pair to cover it up. If u are really safe with trading the safest pair, than what's the point of trading the non safest pair since it increase ur risk ? If trading more pairs decrease ur risk, than why trade less pair and increase ur risk ?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
So here's my graph for the week...... it's rather unusual..... On thursday night I was going to bed with about $70 banked so far for the week, but about $300 DD.... I guessed there might be a retracement in the night, and of course I would be asleep and miss it.... so I attached an account protect EA to an additional chart and set it to close all trades when DD reached -$40..... what I failed to consider, was that the 100x80 ea's would then start opening fresh positions, and as the account protect was set at -$40 it would immediately close them again...... thus the long slow downward slope after the big peak.... eventually MT4 couldn't cope with this activity and I woke to find terminal frozen...... Demo accounts - what would we do without them?! I am now going to look for some kind of account protector that when triggered disallows all EA's from starting up again....... I wonder if there is such a thing? PS I have also attached total activity graph for past 5 weeks..... the steep upward slope in the middle is 0.05 starting lots - I began with 0.01.... and changed to 0.05 but then decided the large DD was too intimidating so switched to 0.02. I'm probably going to try something like 60x48 this week as backtesting looks very favourable for these numbers

--- 帖子 #572 ---
nanningbob Can I confirmed that the EA signal for buy and sell is based on a daily moving average and not stochastics?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
I am running this in demo mode, I have a $2500 mini going with default settings, from post 1, and just started $400 mini with default settings - UCad and - GU, the $2500 default seems to be gaining 40 - 70 a day so far, only ran it last week, I will post results of the other mini as i get data.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
It is not based on anything. I use MA only as a starting point not as an indicator. The code says if price is higher than the low--buy for the buy EA and if price is lower than the high--sell on the sell EA. As soon as you turn it on it does a buy and a sell. We are trading a price range not indicators.

the GU seems to be the money maker, the account that I dropped it is considerably less.

Hi all the demo acount that I started since 6 Nov 08 using the original 12 paris from post #1 at lot size 0.01 had grown to a nice balance of about $6400 from $3000. The EAs were run continuously. Well, it had crashed today casued by eurusd and usdchf leaving a balance of $2300.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Yup gotta stay away from the news, especially interest rate statement unless you went in with a clean slate. In other words you close all your trades so you have the full protection of the range of the EA. It is better just to stay out though.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi Bob, What is the best source for relevant news? Is it the just the Calendar at the home page of Forex Factory or a combination of a few things. What news events do we typically want to stay away from (high impact)? Also, on a day like today with the US announcing the Fed Rate cut, what hours do you typically stay out of the market? Is it the entire US session or different times?

Anything that has to do with interest rates, Bernanke speaking, Trichet and any other super news story. Most of the stories posted on the calendar will not affect the 100x80 as a rule but the bailout votes have caused major havoc on the markets. Beware of any story dealing with the auto makers. If a big story hits I would find a quick exit. The day GM files for bankruptcy I would pack it in and be glad you got out of the forex market alive. The truth is the only place I have really gotten burnt is during the US market time.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Yeah I read that yesterday. Obviously that would affect my EA you would have to use twice as much margin to trade and that may or may not be worth it.

I am going to close out my accounts this week for the year. My wife and I have 2 weeks off for Christmas and I decided that I am not going to trade during this time. I need some time off from trading and traditionally Christmas time is not a great time to trade anyway. I will check in occasionally to posts but I need a break. I went 7 straight weeks of winning and then the last 10 days have not been so good. So take a break, walk away and come back in 2009.

Happy Christmas Bob and have a nice time. I have managed to keep afloat with my audnzd live account. Though I made just $74 on $300 account in about 20 days, the feeling is good and still lot to be learnt. I will be looking forward to you in 2009.

From what I heard the Treasury is bailing out the big 3 so I do not think we will have to worry about GM filing bankruptcy.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Well the treasury is having second thoughts. Chrysler is paying everyone to the end of December and then is out of money. They are closing all their factories for 30 days and are hoping to sell enough inventory to open back up again. If not they maybe finished. GM is not far behind, the problem they are facing and it is a practice that was going to bite them sooner or later but people can no longer finance cars and be upside down in them. Banks, etc. will not take those type of loans anymore. So there are millions of cars out there people can no longer trade in because they owe more than what they are worth. With banks etc under a tighter lending leash people cant get loans so they have to keep their cars. You must have some money now to get a car and that is going to take time to shake out. Most people are going to have to pay down their cars to trade again and if we have deflation they never will until they are paid off. This is very serious and why the car companies are in trouble. Years and Years of taking car loans for greater value than the car. ITS PAYDAY TIME. Unless us wonderful taxpayers bail them out. nice huh.

Here are my settings: Trading only the EUR/USD ,.01 or .02 lots, mult. 1.5, max. trades 15, no stoploss, letting EA run all week, shutting down usually by thur. night. Beginning balance-$3000 Balance after week 1-$3130 (.01) lots, Deepest trade level (9) week 2-$3239 (.01) (10) week 3-$3409 (.02) (10) week 4-$3484 (.02) (9) week 5-$3543 (.02) (6) week 6-$3595 (.05) (4) week 7-$3771 (.05) (11)- Won't trade this big of a lot with this kind of balance again. Was two trades away from a margin call. What a roller coaster ride of a week. Would have been up $466 if I closed thur. pm. but left run and had to take a big hit fri. am. Still up $120 for the week. Will go back to smaller lots.

week 8- $3793 (.02) (4) -only traded one day with the holiday. So I've averaged about $100 a week for two months. At this rate it would take about 8 months to double a $3000 account.

Happy new year, I hope it will be a good one but I have my doubts. For the economy and business it doesnt look good. Because I run a school I will ok for 2nd semester but if business does not pick up by summer I could be looking at a very tough fall. I am not an expert by any means but I thought I would share some thoughts over what I see coming. Even though traders think they run the markets that is simply not true. The Forex was created so that businesses could trade currencies and do business with one another around the globe. Since businesses will be slowing down for the forseeable future I expect the following to happen: 1. Since there will be less money being exchanged market swings will be bigger than normal. This may not make sense but with fewer exchanges there will be more gaps between trades. This will cause bigger swings because when a big exchange does happen there will be fewer buyers and sellers out there so price has to go deeper to find enough buyer/sellers to handle the exchange. 2. If #1 is true then brokers/banks will have to enlarge the spread to cover their butts on trades. We are really seeing this during the Christmas season right now. I just saw the EUR/GBP at 12 pips. I wanted to do a buy but backed off with the wider spread. 3. With bigger swings and wider spreads it will be more difficult for my EAs because they are based on prices staying within a certain range and the spacing of the reentries will be affected by the wider spreads. I am going to continue to sit on the sidelines and demo the first week of January to test out my out look for the new year. If I am wrong then maybe the 2nd or 3rd week I will jump back in live. If not I will try to just manually trade for a while and see if I can catch a couple of these big moves. I wish you all the best, I have always tried to be honest with my EAs and report what I think. I hope I am wrong. nanningbob

As instructed, I put "100x80 ma 80 blank.tpl" in the Template folder with my FXDD demo account. However, the cahrt looks different from the one posted at #519, no MA green , orange, red lines, etc. What am I missing here? I just discovred this EA and am much exited about the potentials. Thanks a lot!

Would you recommend using the new 100x60 with 600 S/L or the original 100x80 with 825 S/L method, please? I've downloaded and installed templates and EAs and everything. Now, I am all ready to demo on my FXDD account. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Depends on how many levels and what currencies. You look at my 7 year currency facts and see what currencies stay in the 600 pip range and stay with those. The problem right now with these trade two ways is prices are fluctuating wildly and are going farther than ever before. Makes it tough with such a system. It really depends on how much money you have to play with.

How can I set up a number of different screen profiles, and then save/import the profiles as Bob has done with the 100x80 folder? Last night I saved a couple of my own profiles (because FXDD didn’t have a couple of pairs missing from Bob’s profile), but the profiles I saved are all gone. On checking I discovered that my profiles are not saved as “chart01.chr - chart25.chr, etc. Am I missing something, or my MT4 platform has a problem?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Save each kind of profile with a different name. I have found when I make changes I also must save the profile. MT4 supposedly saves changes automatically when you close but I have found that is not always true. So when you set up a profile, save it first then run it. That is what I do. If that doesnt solve the problem I dont have any idea. Maybe some of these other guys can help.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
As always, thanks Bob! I forgot to mention that I was running MT4 on Vista Business 32-bit installed laptop. After posting the message, I discovered that my profiles had been saved properly on my XP desktop. It looks as if there were some compatibility issue between Vista and MT4. Anyway, I found my MT4 settings were corrupted after I downloaded/installed multiple MT4 platforms on my laptop, not because I needed them, but I was just killing time and experimenting with this and that, so to speak. I think I read somewhere that Bob installed 8 instances of MT4 on his computer and live trading on two platforms and demo trading on a few other platforms, though. I was wondering up to how many MT4 platforms I could successfully run on my computer. My laptop is a fairly new model with 2.53 GHz Core 2 processor and 3 GB RAM.

No you dont need to change the magic number with each pair. The magic number will be attached with each currency pair and that will distinguish the difference with each order. The different currency pair orders will not be mixed together, they will be treated separately.

Interesting topic...I've thought of this kind of stuff before but I'd love to do some number crunching in Excel to get an idea as to the distribution of directional moves before trading it.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Dighi, How do you get the distribution of directional move in Excel ? Regards

--- 帖子 #611 ---
1. Choose your time period 2. Download the candle data into an Excel spreadsheet 3. Find percent change between open and high or open and low (for up candles/down candle respectively) 4. Graph a distribution of these returns using Excel's analysis toolpack 5. Choose a percentile (top 5%, lower 5%) and isolate these candles 6. Find the percent change from low to close/high to close (for down and up candles respectively) 7. Now you can say with moderate confidence if your system has a statistical edge...use statistics to determine confidence. Good book - Trading Systems that Work http://www.amazon.com/Trading-System...7741974&amp;sr=8-1

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Dighi, Many thanks. You have a screenshot of a example ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Here's a distribution of the S&amp;P 500 weekly returns for the past 18 years. This shows you that huge events, like what your strategy is trying to capture, happen at the "tail end" of the distribution. The height of the distribution shows frequency and the axis shows the size...notice how +- 10% weeks rarely happen, but they do happen. I then did a study to see what the difference between the high and close and low and close was for those candles to see if profit exists. My question is: when price goes one way strongly, does it retrace or does it close at its highs/lows? After doing some quick Excel work I found that in the S&amp;P 500, on days in which price is outside of the normal distribution, there is a profit potential of 13% should you trade counter-trend. Basically what I'm suggesting is make a distribution of returns for the forex markets - use Excel data analysis toolpack and click 'histogram'. -When you have a distribution, then find the events at the tail ends, which is what your strategy is - trying to trade against the trend at the tail ends. -Then study those days where it moves like this and create a trading strategy based on it -No indicators here - pure statistics and history http://tinyurl.com/3mbb5tm

I have tested this method and it is completely and utterly useless ! A complete waste of time. What was NanniBoob thinking? Oh wELL back to the drawing board !

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Interesting stuff, Dighi I am currently trying to implement this on an excel sheet. I have noticed that the most important factor in this strategy is retracement - not so much the volatility of a pair as previously posted. A highly volatile pair such as GBPJPY could make daily movements as big as 1200 pips (6.may.2010), as long as that price moves back enough for you to close you higher level trades you are in the game. And by saying "in the game" you could see what I mean by that in my next post...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Bluesteele, could you please explain why this strategy is "utterly useless" by adding screen shots or showing us what went wrong, so that we could all benefit from your experience. I'm asking for this because so far the strategy is working pretty well and I'm trying to analyse what must happen in order for the system to fail (nothing so far).

I've just found this awesome nanningbob's thread. The concept is just brilliant, and the help and contribution other guys provided to the thread is definitely an example to be followed. I have not yet tested the method because I want to finish reading the whole thread before I start demoing it, but I do have a question for those of you who are trading this method nowadays. Due to the low volatility in past months/years (compared to when the thread started, in the eye of the hurricane in 2008), how's the method doing with the original settings ? =)
