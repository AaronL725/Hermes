Hi again all, ok, here we go again. Based on major S/R, market structure and trend (higher highs, lower lows etc) to get direction of price. Draw in minor S/R and wait for price to break that point and retrace back to the level before entering. Could wait until price actually closes below the line after going above it (for a short) as it's confirmation as per Russ Horn's Rejection Spike (thanks to that poster!) Cheers Pharley

Glad you (re)started the thread! Keep up the great work ...

HI mate - yes I was just waiting for the mods to do 1 or 2 things, then I'd start again. I learned a lesson from the last one - and also how to use the ignore as I'd not used it before. Anyway, I'm hanging out for UK open! Cheers Pharley

Hi again, If you want to supercharge your account, enter multiple times. The last pic I posted above of the USDCAD shows 2 entries taken. THe target was taken by looking at the daily chart for a support level where I think price will get to. I target some pips in front of this. Once the second trade is in, teh SL for the first trade is moved to where the SL for the second trade is, thereby locking in pips. and profit. When price moves in your favour again, move both SL's to a breakeven + a few pips in front of trade 2. This is only 2 trades - look for larger runs (weekly and daily charts between major S/R levels) where you could get 3 or 4 trades in and move SL up or down when you can. It give a huge boost to your profits. Cheers Pharley

Hello Pharley and everyone on this thread. I've been trend trading for a while now and during this time I've learned how to let my profits run, however my entries where just plain awful. Due to my poor entries i would be stuck in a position for days until it turned in my favor or even worse I would liquidate a position with a pretty big SL. This system might just be what i need to improve my entry points. Here are 3 screen shots just to see if i'm understanding how one should enter a position using this simple and clear system. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Saruhn, Those are spot on! There are a couple of ways to enter. 1) enter at the line or just before it as price comes back, or 2) Wait until price crosses the line but then retreats to finish the other side - eg in the third pic at point 1, price crosses it but then finishes above it. You could enter long at that point. Either way, watch the risk side of things. BUt yes, well spotted - I hope it can give you a method to get in more accurate trade entries. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Understood, i'll practice my eyes to spot these entries and see where I go from there. Cheers mate,

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I believe this is the simplest way to trade, No Indicators nothing just some horizontal lines indicating Major SR on Higher TF ( Which one You prefer?) then go down to lower TF see what happen around those lines and wait for a rejection or reaction on the other direction, if it is on the way up wait for a rejection on the way down once the price comes back and breaks the way up You can enter the long trade and vice versa. Or did I get all wrong? If not are You going to wait to enter the trade once the candle closes or You enter the trade immediately as soon as the horizontal line is broken? By the way I see a small indicator and a MA as well on some of your charts. Do you really need them? Thanks for Your answer and of course as many Pips You can get. Ralfy

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Was going to ask the same thing about the MA. Pharley, are you using the MA to give direction to the entries? Only long above, only short below? If so, what values are you using for the MA? Thanks Vlad

--- 帖子 #10 ---
​Hi Pharley, Good to see you've re-opened and thank God you didn't let that complete stump from the other thread put you off! I've just noticed this one which triggered overnight so I'm not on it, but I thought it was interesting as an example of where it would be prudent to use a conservative target, in this case around 1.5R, in anticipation of a support turned resistance zone holding.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Vlad and ralfy, I generally don't use the SMA50 too much, although it's there for reference - sometimes it reminds me to look at the wider picture. Yes Ralfy, I start by looking at major S/R area on a weekly and daily chart and where price is in relation to those - e.g it may have bounced off a major support and is travelling up. Then I'm only looking to go long using these minor S/R areas to get in. I'd target the major resistance area further up, or look to the left of chart to see the next logical place where price may stall. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #12 ---
HI Jack - yeah,not going to be put off! Anyway you could be right with that - even target the next minor S/R area. As long you keep risk at no less than 1:1. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Man , You are awesome. Personally I don't recommend involvement of MAs. I marked the support-resistance from daily. I trade between these two lines. I wait for the news. And after the news when the dust settled down, When my first trade triggered. Then i switch to lower TFs like M30. And trade aggressively between the two lines.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Sajid, No not awesome, although I'll tell the wife! She'll only laugh! Yep,I too am not very keen on MA's - I prefer to see higher highs, higher lows etc to see things trending. Your approach sounds good Sajid - take the S/R levels from the daily and trade on the lower timeframes - I use hourly with this, but it can work on the lower ones like 15m and even 5m I think. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks after all it is so simple and yet We try always to make it complicated I believe the only way to succeed in this business is this very simple rule I consider number 1 Follow the rule and be Patient, Patient and again Patient As for Indicators I gave up long time ago and will never use them again. The only one I would use I do not know if You can call it an Indicator is the one that would show me a candle formation as a Pin Bar, Engulfing, IB etc. not just anyone but only those patterns forming at KEY Support and Resistance on Daily, Weekly and Monthly maybe could consider a 4H Time Frame. There are some out there and free as well but they show to many of these patterns most of them misleading. Is anyone out there who can suggest a good one that makes this Indicator? I say again only the one that appears at KEY SR of Major TF

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Whatever, But I will appreciate your efforts. Take the examples of AUDUSD, AUDJPY consolidation on daily. Perhaps the Daily, H4, H1 trader may not be in position to get much benefit of it. But in the absence of any major news, Trading them on lower TF may have give you thousand of pips. Alas i have not traded them because i was not around.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanks for the kind words Sajid. Happy to help out of I can.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Perhaps the attached matterial(template+indicators) will serve your purpose. I have an EA which trades Pinbars/Engulfing on any TF you want when are formed at (a) Supply Demand Zone (b) Double Top and Bottoms (c) Weekly/Monthly Lows and Highs (d) Round Numbers (e) Channel Boundaries You can select and deselect any of the above to be traded or not. But anyhow, this is not the topic of this thread. Hopefully the attached template will serve your purpose.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Pharley: Can you please list the rules for entry and exit. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) My levels are the highest/lowest H1 open for the day.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let me explain. Trading at the extremes is my preference. Price usually gets "beaten" down at the high by sellers and back up at the low by buyers. The hardest part is waiting for the setup. The wait is usually worth it. Please do not take this the wrong way. When I look at the charts posted by others, see their entries and read their explanations, my entries, in the same direction , have triggered before theirs. My stop loss at the extreme is more likely tighter. There is nothing to learn about trading the highest/lowest H1 open. Just wait for the setup, enter, set you stop loss and manage the trade. No candle reading, no determining the trend, or any other technical analysis. This is just how I trade. Maybe this helps another trader. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Brother to avoid confusion, You please limit this stuff to your amazing thread. It already has a dedicated thread for. This will mix things.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
This is amazing stuff... I looked over a few daily charts and my mind is just blown. Trading can really be this simple. Thanks for sharing!

Nice work Pharley TSD

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi all, No trades for me yesterday (Monday) as the UK was closed for a public holiday. I normally give it a miss during those days. Rules - Not too many really Entry - 1 of 2 things: 1) Aggressive - After I've got my minor S/R drawn, and price breaks through the area, I place a limit order a couple of pips before that line. 2) Conservative - Wait for price to reach or pass the line, then close below it. Then I enter. (This requires more watching). Sometimes you can set up an alert for when price reaches a level - good way to not watch the charts all the time. SL - If I'm entering on 1) aggressive, my SL will be above/below the last swing. But as price (assuming!) moves in my favour I'll move it closer to BE and to BE + a couple of pips when I can. Use discretion here. SL - If I'm entering on 2) conservative, my SL will go a few of pips above a candle that hit or crossed the line, but closed below it. TP - 1) Aggressive - I'll target them all at the same place, which would be based on daily or weekly major S/R areas. Typically I'd target several pips in front of that. Actually I try and take 80% to 90% of a move between major S/R which can be found on daily/weekly charts. TP 2) Conservative - I'd be targeting the next minor S/R level. To be honest how you enter with this and exit and manage trades is really up to the individual. I'm just pointing out the potential trades as I see them on the charts. Here I put down how I go about entering this sort of trade and target - please feel free to use that or invent your own method. I do manage the trade/s when I'm in - I'm always looking for multiple entries. But I don't enter a second trade until I can move SL to BE + 2 or 3 pips on the first trade. Same with the 3rd trade - I must be able to get trades 1 and 2 safe with a SL in front of entry. If I'm entering a 3rd trade, both exiting SL's from trades 1 and 2 move together to the same place to lock in profit. Hope that helps. Cheers Pharley

Hi ya Pharley BIG thanks for all the great info you've put out there on FF really appreciated I had a few questions if you could please help with?.. Is this your trading plan still or you have made changes of certain points? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...88#post8413188 On point 2 you say you look for PA candles, other than the Pin Bar what other candle patterns are you looking for at the key levels?..Is it the candle patterns Nial teaches or other candle patterns? At the start of this thread you are using 1Hr TF's in some of the charts is that now a major part of managing and entering a trade now? Sorry for all the questions and would appreciate any help you could offer please.. Cheers, Adrian

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi TS - your method looks interesting mate! I took that first pic of eurusd 15m charts and drew a few potential trades on it - see below. Not many pips at this timeframe - probably because UK not open, but still they would have worked out. Target is taken from a S/R area to the left of chart. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for that mate - It does look interesting. I encourage those who are looking for a way to trade to go look at it. Read around and see if something clicks with you and how you prefer to trade. It's like an eternal learning process! But don't fall in to the trap of switching methods time and time again - choose a strategy or method you're happy with and stick with it. Master it, use it all the time before learning another. It could be just trading pin bars off the daily or 4hr chart, Or just 50% retraces. Or this one of mine or TS's great one. There are heaps, but do't get confused by switching between loads of them. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Steve, and thanks. Yes it's amazing how many you see when you start looking across different pairs, commodities and timeframes. All the best Pharley

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Oh thanks for that TSD! Much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Wise words

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thanks. My question is regarding the minor S/R. Is that discretionary or is it more rule based.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Ramjet, The more questions the better! Yes I still trade as per my first thread. Actually this current thread could be looked on as a development of the first. In the first I'm looking at weekly/daily major S?R areas and targeting them. The entries were based off a few things (I still use those), but this thread is dealing in seeing really easy simple entry positions utilising minor S/R areas when something is trending. Whether you target the major S/R areas or the next minor S/R area is up to you. Some are really happy getting 10 to 20 pips, others want to ride the waves to score max pips possible. Either is valid as long as you watch your risk. To answer your questions - My trading plan covers quite a few set ups. I use this one on this thread, but I also look for 50% retracements a lot - they happen many times too. In terms of PA type bars - yes for sure pins are important. The reason? Take a railroad 2 bar setp - if you combine the 2 candles, you get a pin. If you use a shooting start 3 candle set up and combine those 3, you get a pin bar again. But I also look for thrusting and piercing candles. I'm also looking at momentum, market structure etc etc. Many thing, but I don't want to confuse things here. Here it's all about seeing 1 simple set up and the opportunities that arise from that. Perhaps you can add it to your own method. Niall Fuller, Nick Benecino, The Forex Guy etc - all good sites and can take you through PA trading. Well worth a look and read. YEs I would trade the same sort of patterns as those guys. Re 1hr candles - If I've got the time, yes I'll trade the 1 hr charts, as long as it's in line with daily/weekly market structure, direction and trend. The 4hr candles are great too if you haven't got too much time. It all depends on the time you have and how you want to trade. I generally don't go below 1 hour, but whatever timeframe I'm using, I always refer upwards to the daily and weekly. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi TS and thanks for the question. I'm just waiting for a retrace in a trend. Many times during a 1 hour candle you can see price start to retrace and it's tempting to enter during that hour. But a far better way is just to wait until that candle closes. (it's also less effort just looking at just once per hour or every 4 hours if trading 4hr charts). If you wait until candles close, you can then start to see those S/R areas - I'm talking minor ones here - and draw a line at the appropriate area. Then you're waiting until price breaks and closes above/below it. As you're waiting for the candle to close, you do get a definite signal - it has close above or below the area. Then you can set your trade. In terms of direction - get the major S/R identified, then the trend. If I see higher highs and higher lows, it's trending up, the reverse is down. If there were a rule for this bit, it would be something like - there must be a trend and the trend is higher highs and higher lows for uptrend, and lower highs and lower lows for a downtrend. If you look at the charts we've posted and other charts, you can see the best trades form this method are taken when this HH/HL or LH/LL is in place. The trick is to recognise that is happening (easier to see if you zoom out), and only take these trades during trending periods. Don't forget to look for rising or falling channels too - this works well inside of those. I really like channels!! Channels with this method of entry plus looking for pin bar set ups and 50% retracements is a good combination of things to look for. But keep it simple - identify one thing at a time before trying to look for others - it's just confusing at first. Hope that helps mate! Cheers Pharley

Brilliant!! thank you so much for the detailed answers Pharley, really appreciated!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
nice thread pharley, use it all the time esp the Russ Horn setup if you dont mind me asking, how much do you risk per trade? and what is you typical risk : reward?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi ya Danzka Not sure if this will help with the answers in some way until Pharley gets back to you but these were 2 posts of his about his MM back a few months ago..not sure if he is still using the same but a great MM concept that I've never seen or heard of before.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...55#post8411155 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...55#post8412455

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Danzka, Yes I think it's a good simple way to look at things too. R:R I never go less than 1:1. If I'm doing this 1 hr stuff, I prefer around 1:1.5 or 1:2 If I'm trading 4hr going towards weekly/daily S/R targets then it varies. That's because I'm entering multiple times, so the first trade might be targeting say 1:8 the second 1:7, etc. How much do I risk - Typically I would keep risk at around 3% to 6% no matter how many trades I'm in. But it's tricky looking at risk as a %. Say you've got $10,000 in your account and risk 5% = $500. But say you've got another $40,000 tucked away somewhere. That $500 risk now becomes 1% of your total funds. If that's the case, I'd be happy to up the $ risk I use in the account. I much prefer looking at risk as $ than % as I can live off $ but not %. If your account is say $2,000 you may feel comfortable risking $200. With a $50,000 account you might be ok with $2,000 risk. Different percentages all around. I just prefer to think about how much I'm risking in $ When I'm entering multiple times, I do try to get the first trade to BE + some pips as I enter the second and just keep doing that to reduce the risk until I'm risk free. That's a great position to be in! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks Ramjet, I'll look into it

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks Pharley, I'm still working on entering D1 swing with small risk, this method fits right in

--- 帖子 #42 ---
hi last evening i was tested this method with demoring ..got some gud results so i like to sharing it..

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thanks Ramjet - yes still going along that MM route. Works well. Cheers

--- 帖子 #44 ---
No worries Danzka - go have a read on my other thread, as it deals with more swing-like trading taking the longer term view using major S/R from daily and weekly charts. Cheers

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi US, Hey that's great! Perhaps it does work on the shorter timeframes?! Ah well, keep at it and get those $ rolling in! Cheers

--- 帖子 #46 ---
​@pharley,do you enter when the candle 'crosses the line' or do you enter on the next candle? cheers :]

--- 帖子 #47 ---
pharley why there entries? U play breakout without retests? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Took GBPJPY trade. Solid entry i guess, will see how it develops.. Ill exit at BE+ some worst case

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi Nozzer - see post 25 on page 2

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Kubiasty, Break and retrace entries. You've missed a few in your diagram. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi - how did it go? I can see G/Y went back down. I just had a quick look across the charts. Not too much in terms of a good set up so far today, i.e. trending.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hey Pharley, Yup, its going back down, most likely I'll be stoped @ BE + a few pips. I also took a EURCAD short yesterday and its been very sluggish. Maybe its better to not take trades until something starts happening

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I reckon you're right mate. Not impressed with the PA on the charts right now. I'll probably sit out until things start moving properly again. If you're in profit, take it off the table - I would. Let's wait until some trending starts happening and we can cherry pick the good ones. Choosing not to trade is a valid choice and often can save your account. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Very true, sometimes not trading is the best thing one can do.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi, Took the following trade on NU, is my entry correct? Hope it goes to to TP, set my SL at previous low 2 candles back. Moved SL to BE at 50% of TP. Vlad

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Looking at the Daily GBPJPY I noticed a very nice area where price either resists breaking or just blows through the area. And if I'm using your entry correctly there was a very nice opening for a long pos @~158.439 24.05.2016 Red arrows show resisting and X marks show where it moves strongly through it taking all the Buy/Sell stops?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Pharley Â Good stuff Â Could you please show some set-ups that you wouldnt take and explain why. Â when do you prefer a more conservative entry vs a more aggressive entry. Â I am allso curious to know if you have changed the way you trade since youre first thread or if you still trade that way. Â Â Kind regards

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Great to see you back Pharley! I followed your 4H thread with 50%Fibo entries and I was very interested. Im sure I can learn from you Best of luck with the thread! Regards,

--- 帖子 #59 ---
HI Vlad yes that look ok. I had a good look at the chart on my platform and can see the hour candle did close above the area, so well spotted and good entry. Looking at the chart this morning I can see your TP should have been hit. How did it go? Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Saruhn, Yes looks goof the an entry on the 1 day chart. I took a look at where you had crosses, but on the 1 hour chart - I post these pictures below. As you can see, there was a definite break, retrace and the possibility to get in at those levels. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi Alaska and thanks for your question. Yes there are quite a few I wouldn't take - I attach a couple of pics below. The first one shows a 1hr G/Y chart. On this you can see price closed above a S/R area then fell back down rapidly. Now why wouldn't have I take a long trade after it crossed over? Look at the second pic, which is a daily chart showing the PA leading up to it. Price had recently fallen through a rising trend/support line and could possibly be on the way down again to the lower Support area. (In fact it did, but that's only known with hindsight). Looking at the daily chart gives me an idea of when to avoid taking a long or short - I'm only interested in going with the flow and trend. So what to do? Look for opportunities to short the pair, not go long. On the hour chart again, you can see price again crosses that line, then produces a wonderful (small) bear candle, closing both beneath the line and beneath the low of the bull candle that closed above the line. This is a good strong signal to enter short. The target area could be the daily chart low, or on the hourly chart, there is a swing low just to the left of the action - target just above that. It's amazing how many time price will return to the same swing point. Look for multiple entries too, not just the one. I can several opportunities to short that pair at that point. Oh I forgot - conservative vs aggressive. For me, the aggressive entry can be taken when everything is spot on. That means a trend in place on the daily, 4 hr and 1 hr chart, a clear consolidation area before a clean break through, then price if coming back to that break area with not too much momentum. If price is really hurrying to get back there, I'd wait to see what happens. If price is meandering it's way back, it shows a lack of commitment from traders to push the price in that direction again. That's the sort of thing I'm looking at - hope it helps a bit. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hey, hi there Tib. Good to see you on here again! Yes those 50% fibo entries are still valid and still traded by me. Cheers mate Pharley

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes, went to TP. Could have gone even more I guess. I need to work on the best option for SL and TP. But otherwise the method looks good! Thanks Pharley! Vlad

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi mate - well done on the win! Don't forget to look at a higher timeframe to see what the potential TP could be - below are a 4hr chart with a possible TP (S/R) area shaded and another of the 1 hr chart with 3 possible trades. Cheers Pharley

Break out

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Gee I was hoping Sajid would post something. He sent me an email saying he had won a lot yesterday. I asked if he would post charts on here so people could see entries etc. Next thing I know, he's unsubscribed. Oh dear.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
He found the "holy grail" and ran away haha xD

--- 帖子 #71 ---
oppsss hope he will post something here..

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Ah well, hope he makes a motza - all of us too !!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
today my trade.. only this one took.. gud setups missed in the early morning

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Terrific mate! Really only need a win a day or so to make good. Keep it going. It's really good to see some positive results. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #75 ---
​This one might be setting up.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Let me add few cents of mine. The main idea of marking support resistance levels is same as pharley. but i trade with following two additions. (i) I take my initial support resistance from daily. This servers as my starting and ending point. (ii) I use highs and lows for marking SR levels but my my entry is based on "Where candles where closing " BEFORE SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE GOT BROKEN ". This way i manage few pips early entry as compare to other support resistance traders. This few pips have excellent advantages in regard of setting a Safe BE. The entry can be further refined by considering round numbers, SL hunt in mind and the spike. The thick Green line is daily resistance. The thick Red line daily support. the thin green lines are levels marked on lower timeframe H1. the yellow lines are Pending order Entry points. This is not a hand picked. The rules can be applied to any swing/range/trend. Yesterday i have almost 1000 pips trading CAD/AUD pairs in NY.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
​Flippin' heck, how did I manage to miss this one earlier?! DOW continuation trade at 50% retracement.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Dear pharley, I wonder how it happened that i got un-subscribed. It also happen with one of my subscriber two days ago that he un-knowingly got un-subscribed from me. I am subscribed to you again with Love. I posted with details that how i trade your system. Next time, I will try to post my trades if possible, i will make a video of it.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
its a great way to trade there a links from chanya he explain this way to trade http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...38#post5876538

--- 帖子 #80 ---
great work sajid

--- 帖子 #81 ---
HI Jack, That 4hr chart looks interesting in terms of a retrace to level. If price gets above that daily chart resistance things could get interesting. Either look to short around there or if a breakthrough, look for the retrace. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Sajid, Great to have you here again! Not sure what happened - the wonders of modern tech! Thanks so much for posting your method - it looks great and based on some sound principles. I think you could take a basic break and retrace type method and tweak certain aspects of it to suit how you like to trade and it would still be good. It goes to show how important Support and Resistance are in trading! Thanks again Pharley

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Oh Jack don't worry - heaps of them about but yes it's frustrating at times. I also miss loads of them - e.g. one of our kids is sick at the moment. If it were me, I'd have man flu and be bedridden for days! But what that means is I didn't have much time last night to look at charts or do much of anything. Wife is busy with the sick one while I'm seeing to the other 2. Ah well, real life! Hopefully I can get something done today Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Free and thanks for that link. I'll have a good read of it today - I just had a quick look and it seems like good stuff. Again it's a tweak around break through and retrace I think. That type of PA happens so much that many people see it and develop something around it to get in to a trade and set SL and TP. All terrific stuff. Thanks Pharley

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Like the color scheme. Easy on the eyes. Please post blank template. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
​I'm pondering on this entry on the 60 min from daily resistance, any views?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi Jack, As I write this it's already moved south by about 13 to 15 pips and is now down near a minor support. Interesting if it tries the break southwards further then retrace. Keep an eye on it and don't do anything hasty. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Just remember to be careful - we've got non-farm employment and unemployment claims news out in a while. Always red flag items. Things can get a little slow re volatility leading up to these. Cheer Pharley

Sir, It will be tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
​Thanks Pharley, I'd forgotten about the news, I thought ADP was normally on the Wednesday before Non Farm. I've moved my stop on AUDUSD to breakeven.

HI Sajid - yes the non farm and unemployment rate are tomorrow (Friday). Today is ADP NF employment change and unemployment claims. All red flag items the lot of them! Cheers

​Just spotted this one from yesterday. There was no obvious setup at the high from daily resistance but there was a nice continuation entry on the 11 am bar after price had closed below both support from the previous evening and the 240 min 20 ema which had peaked and was now turning down.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
​Saying that, I've just looked again and when price closed below the low of the small bearish pinbar at the high, price did then retrace to within 1 pip of the low of the pinbar so I guess that could have been an aggressive entry.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Caught this one yesterday. Could've entered at a better spot (109.63) but saw it too late. and i exited position because of all the news incoming.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Really enjoying this thread. Thanks for posting charts. Just finished reading "Price Breaks Through" .

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi fxtrader, Thanks for the comment. Yes there are quite a few good threads related to this sort of thing. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi all, Remember to always take in to account the longer timeframes. It's worth looking at weekly, daily and 4hr charts to see strong levels. Here's an example - Pic 1 is a 1hr chart of gold. Trade taken on retrace and the target is way off. Pic 2 shows where the target comes from. It's a 4hr chart and you can see the target area off to the left which was a nice swing low. It's not too far really and well within current price ranges. Pic 3 is that trade taken from statement. Oh and it's not my trade! Otherwise there would be stop loss in there. Sure I think more could have been gained, but stick to your targets and trade plan - there are always a lot more to be had. Cheers Pharley

Dear, Basically are u suggesting to use trend only and no indicator.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Brother, Kindly find the attached. There is only one indicator which i use for Pin Pointing my entry.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thank you very much for sharing.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
hi i want to know this system.who help me to start tnx

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I would also be interested in learning more about this method of trading and adding some more value to the group.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
you can begin with this http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...82#post6882782

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Below are my EURUSD and NZDUSD Longs based on the rules posted earlier and basic rules of pharley. My entries running in excellent profit. But i made few mistakes also in the process. I am sharing here so that others can learn from it. (i) Don't add when your last added position running in loss. Add only when your at least one level up from last added position level. Even if you are in overall profit. Otherwise it will quickly eat up your profits and most probably you will have a quick B.E or huge loss. I did it on EURUSD when i was almost 100 pips up on EURUSD but when i add up by ignoring the fact that my last added position is running in loss. Luckily i survived with the last two added position but its to danger to add if your last added position is running negative. (ii) Don't set up your target behind strong consolidations. Wishing you all a happy and prosperous life. EDIT: Please ignore the current SL position in pics. I just placed the SL temporarily there to get a clear picture of my entries for the forum.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Eco, Yeah I prefer no indicators, just using major and minor S/R areas to identify trend and entries with this method. Simple. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi all, Well this has got scrappy pretty quickly. There are a couple of questions above wanting to learn more about this system, but as another system has been posted in this thread, I don't know if people are referring to this other system or not? I think that's why things can get confusing really quickly for people. If you've got another system you'd like to share, happy for a link to be put on the page, but please don't post details/charts of it here as it just confuses people - especially me! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Sajid, thanks for that! Can you mark you entries on the graphs please? I struggle to find your entries to check how to apply the rules. - still learning so not so easy to spot all the time Thanks! Vlad

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Are we always using the 15min time frame?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi fx - I use the daily, 4hr and 1hr only. Daily to get major S/R, 4hr and 1hr for the minor S/R. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Really enjoying this method! Thanks Pharley! I took this trade on NZDUSD H1. I set my target at the upper blue level, which was a resistance point on the D1. I closed it early as I am getting a bit nervous ahead of NFP. Vlad

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Brother I don't understand what you mean exactly by Graphs? . All my trades hit the TP. Regarding EURUSD TP hitting, It was just because of NPF and luck. If it was a normal day, I was not suppose to keep my trades. Next time, I am not repeat this mistake to add positions when my last added position running in lose.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
nice to heard that sajid... he asking to mark ur entry and exit areas... simply u can drag and drop ur closed trades from history tab.. then others may know where u enter ..

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Terrific Vlad - glad that one worked. Nothing wrong in taking profits off the table or moving SL when big news is due. Great stuff!

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thought I'd just post some pics - someone wanted some help so I drew these up as an explanation. It's about as simple as I can make it. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #116 ---
HI all, I just looked at NZDUSD for the last 1 week - Mon to Fri - and looked for any of these simple setups on the 1hr chart. I counted 26. Using a risk:reward of 1:1, 22 of them won and 4 lost. I may have missed a few. So what does that mean in $? Assume you risk $100 on a trade - with 1:1 you make $100 if it wins and lose the $100 if it loses. That's (22 x $100) = $2,200 wins less losses of (4 x $100) = $400. Total for the week = $1800. Ok that's all of them - if I could only take a third of them - let's say 8 trades less a couple of losers still nets $600. And that's on 1 pair, trading 1 timeframe, with just a risk:reward of 1:1 risking $100. It's hard to make it simpler than that. Just 1 of these a day would do. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #117 ---
but r r ration should be 1:1.5 atleast then only if 4 loss means 4x1 and win means 4X1.5=6 so equal trades loss and win also will give net 2 in hand consider this .. never be equal rr.. always 1:1.5 or 1:2

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Ramzam, Yes for sure a greater R:R is better. I'm just pointing out what happens with a simple approach. This could probably be improved with a larger than 1:1. But don't get stuck too much on R:R of 1:2, 1:3 - just get the basics right in terms of a set up that works. There is no hard and fast written rule about using R:R - if you can make 1:1.2 then that's good. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Pharley! Thanks for this, it helps a lot with my understanding! Just to check, please look at this S/R you have drawn in the line below. Should the line not be drawn at the Red line? This is because the close of the next candle, closed above the close of the previous candle. Regards

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Pharley, I try to understand more of your pre-decission about which pair you are going to trade. Can you please share some of your thoughs for the upcomming week on H4 basis? I think this would help a lot. Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Somewhere I read think in terms of zones rather than one price point.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
​There was also a very nice entry on NZDUSD on the 240 min chart from daily support.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Really nice explanations Pharley. Since I've started using this technique I've been boosting my results considerably. As you noted on the NZDUSD there are just so many nice setups regularly. Now i just have to limit myself to 4 pairs max that i choose and patiently wait for price to come to the areas of interest, so I avoid overtrading. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Yea, I would assume that looking at zones instead of just one price point is more objective.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Graph = chart.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Objective or Subjective? Maybe fuzzy rather than precise? Example: Precise would be at the open, high, low, close, midpoint, pivot, fib numbers, etc. Fuzzy would be within N pips +/- of those levels. Placing stop loss levels requires precision. Entry levels not so much. Entries require precise timing. Get the timing right, the level will not matter, only the direction matters.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi Vlad, That's interesting! Actually you could sneak another one in there where you said. Keep spotting them mate! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Maddin, I generally don't think too much about which pair I'm going to trade - I just stick to looking at majors and quite a few of the major/minor crosses. When I look at charts over the weekend (when I get chance), I'm looking to make sure major S/R are marked at the very least. Then as markets move in the week, looking to take trades with minor S/R areas popping up. That's with this particular method - I also am looking for other things such as daily pin bars, 50% retracements etc. Everyone has to do their own analysis - I can point people in a direction with what to look for, how I analyse charts, but the actual effort, analysis and review has to come form the individual. Otherwise there's not much learning going on, and the learning is crucial to future success in this game. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi TS, yes that's right - S/R are areas or zones. For this method I use a line. Many times it's right at the high or low of a bar, or the open or close (body) of the bar, or somewhere inbetween. This is one of the things that's hard about trading. There is no 100% absolutely correct level to mark on charts. The "getting your levels right" really comes form screen time - by that I mean looking at charts and drawing them in, seeing what happen when price comes back to them. Did I draw the line at the right place - if not, why not. Is it because it's an "area" and not a line - most often yes that's the reason why. Practice drawing these areas of S/R (or supply/demand) - like anything, the more you practice, the better you become. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Jack - yes and there were a few more as well (see the others?). Some of these would be duplicates of those taken on the 1hr charts, but if chart time is an issue, go with the 4hr charts instead or daily. Cheers

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Terrific Saruhn! Good to see it's working. Could you let us know what pairs you're looking at? Yes the NZDUSD is a good one, probably AUDUSD as well, plus the AUD crosses - perhaps euraud and gbpaud. Anyone got some good ideas on pairs you can share? Good idea to keep it to 4 pairs - nice on screen and it doesn't become confusing trying to look at 20+ pairs! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I've been having a crack at this in a simulator over the weekend. I can see the potential, and i can see what people are talking about when they're posting the charts they're posting. Just can't seem to quite get it in "real" time. Today I've been sticking to trying to put lines only on the most recent swing, but still not a great deal of success.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Where are you trading? In the middle of the chart? Near the high or low? Both? What direction are you trading? Towards the open? Away from the open? Both? Could you narrow your choices to one of each?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Rub, Yes it can be a tricky spotting anything in real time. Here's something I look for that may help. See pic below - it's a 1 hour, but if you look at that chart on the daily you will see gbpaud has come away from a resistance area and is falling. Now when to enter? Well I know from the daily and 4 hr charts that it's in a bear trend. Looking at the picture we have a nice retrace upwards, then price reverses. Look at the bear bar I marked and drew a minor support at the bottom of it. Not long after price makes a new low and closes below there - that's my signal that says - price has now returned to the bear market after the retrace. Then I place a short limit order just before the minor support (now resistance) - and wait. Look to the price action to the left to decide where to take profit. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Haven't decided which pairs yet, however i just want to limit myself so i dont get lost in 20+ pairs. I sometimes enter a bunch of different pairs and when the P/L starts to fluctuate i get lost. I make mistakes that I wouldn't normally make due to over burdening myself. Last week i was making a profit however i was entering trades too late. The red arrows on the USDJPY shows where i should've entered. 230 pips usdjpy 2 trades; and 160 on gbpaud, however i dont really know if the gbpaud entry qualifies as this technique. But it was a really clear cut trade with no stress .

--- 帖子 #136 ---
amazing trade..... please explain it with some more details of chart..

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi What is the edge here, the trend i think and we find it by a 50sma ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I just "try" to follow Pharley's examples. It usually is a lot sloppier in real time tho. Check out his screenshots and study it. I did the same, no magic.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Practice makes a man perfect. In real time, The key is to not hurry, not panic, stick to the plan. Ultimately, you will be paid most of the times. Most of the times, we make the mistake of chasing price. We thought that we will miss the move so we enter. That's not right. Price don't move straight. It moves like a spiral. So you will get many execution opportunities. No Need to hurry.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Agreed, just by having that type of trading approach you will be able to reduce the number of impulsive, hurried up entries that usually turn out bad. Being patient and letting price come to you instead of chasing it will also reduce the level of stress throughout trading which will for sure have a positive impact on the P/L.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Saruhn, That's terrific mate - well done. I like that it was clear cut and no stress trade! Don't worry too much about entering a bit late - you're getting the hang of it and the more you do, the better you will be at it. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi jgadefelth, The edge is in taking simple, uncomplicated price action trades. Yes you can use the 50SMA if you wish - most of the time I don't. I use my eyes to tell me if it's an uptrend or downtrend. (higher highs, higher lows etc). A horizontal line is all that's needed. I know that sounds too simple, but it's true. Remember, many people overcomplicate their charts - some so bad I can't even see the price, which is crazy. We're trading the price - we make profits from the price movement. If I can't see price for indicators stuck all over the place, I don't even look at the chart. Drives me crazy. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi all, I've received quite a few good emails about success using this method. I'm not really surprised as when you look at the charts, you can see it working more times than not. One point that's been raised a couple of times is being able to see these real time as they form and some peoples difficulty with that. This is one of the most common problems - being able to see stuff real time, and I have a theory as to why that happens. I suspect the main reason why people can't see these things develop in real time is because they're sat in front of the charts all the time looking for them. I know that sounds a bit crazy, but bear with me. When you sit in front of charts looking for set ups all the time, you'll change between timeframes, change between pairs, get distracted by the dog, cat, going to make coffee/tea, going to the toilet, shops, whatever. Here's what to do to get rid of that problem and start seeing set ups as they form - Stop looking at the charts all the time. What I mean by that is do the following - If you're trading off the 1 hour charts, set your mobile/watch/online alarm to go off 5 minutes before the close of the hourly candle. When it goes off, then open your charts and look for the close and potential set up when the new candle opens. Don't be distracted by what happens during the hour of the candle - you're ONLY interested where it closes. Go do something else during that time and don't look at charts. Draw any lines/areas required, set any limit orders required, reset the alarm clock, then shut it down and walk away for 1 hour. (If you trade 4 hr charts, then set everything for the 4 hr candle close). If you're not having success, do the above - plus only look at a maximum of 4 charts (actually, preferably 1 or 2 charts to start). This cuts down the confusion, cuts down the chance of missing a trade and helps you focus. If you do this, you get in to the habit of 1) not sitting in front of charts all day; 2) will be able to see many more set ups; 3) become a more balanced trader - life/work balance. The method I describe here should be VERY easy to see. E.g Once you gave that candle/bar in a down trend that doesn't produce a new low, draw that line in as minor support. Are they easy to spot with hindsight? Yes of course - but if they are so easy to spot, why not spot them real time? It's because of overlooking at charts. Just give it a go - set the alarm for 5 mins before closing and just look at the closing time. You will see set ups as they happen. This will work on any set up - remember you've read a thousand times - wait for the close of the candle. Terrific - so why sit in front of charts waiting for that? If you do sit and wait, you'll get distracted and miss the close, you'll miss the trades. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

Here is a 5 min chart from nzdusd this morning. I don't trade 5 min charts, but someone probably does! Also a 15 min audusd chart Cheers Pharley

Another quick 15 min chart trade.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hello pharley, I have read thro' your posts a couple of times and I am impressed with your approach ! I have used your idea's to polish my own, which are a very close parallel. I have been searching for clues on setting SR's for some time now and have tried testing levels selected from MN, W, D, for the major levels, even use different colours for each TF. I had to conclude that levels on MN were a waste of time ( for me anyway ). I now use W for major levels drawn full length and white ( for W ) and short blue levels in D and H4 charts for the "local" or minor levels. I have yet to decide on using the H/L's for levels or the candle CLOSE. I tend to favor the CLOSE. Example pic attached. As a 78 yo I don't get into posting very much but I do read a great deal. I think that makes me a "lurker" ? I have to congratulate you also for the magnificent thread dealing with the SR levels and for sharing your trading system so clearly, no confusing pics or dialog, so nice to read. Marvelous clarity and thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Dear Pharley, thank you very much for you effort, totally subscribied. Is it possible to show more trades and pics from 4H TF because there are people like me that haven´t much time during day to watch cahrts every hour. I guess these S/R levels appears on this TF too. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Is this about where you're talking about? A sell stop where I've marked with the yellow lines with a stop about 1.9935.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi Fairwind, Many thanks for your kind words. I'm glad you're getting something out of it and yes, I've tried to be as simple as possible with it (the wife tells me I'm simple!). Your approach seems sound - anything to do with identifying these important levels and trading off them tends to work well as long as sounds money mgt and risk mgt are employed. A lurker?? Oh, I don't mind a few lurkers mate. Besides, you're in WA which so that's good! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Mhons, Actually I just took a trade off the 4hr timeframe, but it's not this method. Happy to show it anyway. First pic - audusd 4hr. I too the long on the break of the nice looking pin-ish looking bar. Trend is up. TP is just a placeholder - looking at the daily chart, I may revise that TP level upwards. I'll see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Some other 4hr charts - 2nd one down is interesting - the gbpjpy. The red arrow trade would probably have lost. The same could be said of the trade at the yellow arrow. However, as pound/yen moves so much, price actually went up at this point by 60+pips. If I'm up 60 pips I can tell you that for sure I move my stop to BE + a few pips! (sorry - had to edit as I'd put the wrong chart in) Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Oh my apologies mate - I forgot to attach a pic of what I was looking at - here it is below.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Trade taken earlier this month - USDJPY. I think Ramjet is interested to see this one. Breakthrough and retrace again. Nice and simple. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #154 ---
LOL, can you stop teasing us with these simple clean trades I'm starting to dream of too much money in my account

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi ya Pharley.. With the stops for these trades how would you place them? I'm thinking the normal idea you would do would be at the swing low but being a 4Hr TF could be a ways away or is it a case of your dropping to the 1Hr TF and finding a swing low for a tighter stop??

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I draw few lines at AUD/USD H1 TF, I guess for newbies is really good to use direction EMA 50 and enter after break, close and retest of broke minor S/R zones, also is good to consider S/R zones from bigger TF like D1 W1 and trend on these timeframes, right? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi there, Yes you're more or less right with those SL placements. The first one is a no brainer - easy to spot. The others - yes I like the stop under the bar that actually crosses the S/R area. Go for at least 1:1 and preferably more (I do like 1:2 and 1:3 despite what's said earlier in the thread - trying to keep this simple, but it depends on the type of set up I'm using). Sometimes PA lends itself to a good placement of a SL. Sometimes you have to guess, say 40 pips or 50 pips on a good moving pair and less with less volatility (use ATR? I never do but others might do). The key thing is the money and risk mgt. Get that right with each trade -risk mgt is the key to longevity in trading. The charts and PA are always tempting mate - just got to know when to say no as well as yes, when to pile in, when to hold back. One good trade like that a month/week is all you need! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Mhons, Yes your description is correct, but don't get hung up too much on the SMA50. It can be an ok indicator of direction, but also trust your eyes to see the higher highs, higher lows etc to get the trend. Drawing in the weekly/daily major S/R is a key element because you can see where price is and what it's doing in relation to that market structure. Also, don't draw too many lines on there from the 1 hr - try keeping it as clean as possible and just concentrate on the minor SR areas that are within the immediate vicinity of current price. You want one minor S/R the price is creating and another as a target (or major S/R). So just a couple of lines should be fine to work with. Draw your major lines/areas with a different colour or different line type, but be consistent across all your charts with it. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #159 ---
cheers thanks for that yes, I know what you mean can get a bit to excited about a flow of good trades ego goes to your head and bam! there goes the account!.. Yes the potential of 1 or 2 good trades a week compounded over a month can be great!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hey Pharley, I read thru all 8 pages and got rid of most indicators and work only on lines and i would like to say, it is much better. Throw in some demo trades and got 3 out of 4 trades in the blue, the one that was red was a mistake. Oh yeah! This looks like how it should be traded, with confidence. Thank you bro, for once i can see clearly and no indicators to lag the systems. Cheers mate!

Pending set on AU, hopefully it triggers. Vlad

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi Vlad, I am on the same trade. (y)

--- 帖子 #163 ---
may i ask you if you could explain the SL to me, i don´t understand why you set you´re SL there?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I just placed my SL at most recent swing low. It's a bit scew because I moved the entry point around. Trade hit stop loss unfortunately... You win some and you lose some. Vlad

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi Pharley How do you select the pairs you trade with this method? trending pairs or results with manual backtest. And do you ever exit a trade manually deciding the trade is no longer valid or is the trade always valid until SL or TP is hit? Regards

--- 帖子 #166 ---
just wondered that the SL was so tight regarding to the News (speech of yellen). Maybe just the timing was bad - shit happens

--- 帖子 #167 ---
how did you decide to enter long there? the fibo wasn´t formed at that point

--- 帖子 #168 ---
My GBPJPY Long entries. Because of the start of Holly month of Ramadan, I was not able to manage time for trading. But this evening I caught this entry. It was straight in profit as whistle. I placed the Pending Long after Yellen was not able to create great impact. Opened two positions, Will close half of the position on the Blue line shown in pic. So i will be automatically on B.E. Brothers, It's not the only thing to see only Support , Resistance. Because Support, Resistance is not a fixed price , Its in fact a zone. Try to investigate where exactly the sensitive price is. Brother fairwind has rightly highlighted the point of "CLOSE of CANDLE" rather the high Low of candle. There is always been a confusion whether to consider close of candle or high/close of candle. I always resolve this confusion with help of round numbers. I will try to explain this with help of an example. Let's say I am interested in going long on a Support. But as we know SNR are zones rather fixed prices. So i will see What's the round number / key number between Support and Close of candle. There will always be a round number for you. Next is to see "Once after touching the support" where candles were closing exactly. It should be somewhere around that round number. For long entries , you are required to set your entry few pips below this number. If round number is close to support level(the lowest been made) then set your entry at that low price. viewing support/resistance in terms of round numbers will always help you to have the lowest possible DD.

Arrrggggh. That was staring me right in the face when I got home from work. I guess it just come down to chart time to recognize this stuff. Thanks for the chart BTW, confirmed to me I'm on the right track.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
That's too funny.. but true ...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
due to this thread i can decide where to short where to long ..... really thank you all

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi Vlad - just watch out for entering long in to any potential resistance areas. I just had a quick look and could see this (below) on a 4hr chart. Sometimes though, no matter what you do trades don't work out.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Alaska, For selecting pairs, I just look at charts and see how much a pair respects the S/R areas and what seems to win a lot. Being price action it would work on most TF and pairs - have a look yourself. The AUD tends to move predictably so I like that one, and if you want big pip moves when trading AUD, go for euraud or gbpaud rather than audusd. But by all means take a look around the charts at various pairs on different time frames and you'll find something that suits. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Max, Ah I see what you mean. I'll explain - I don't use the fib tool as a fib tool. I just use it as a measuring tool and only really when I'm looking for 50% retracements trades. I just happen to have had it open when looking at that chart and used it to measure a 1:1 R:R. You're right in saying price hadn't gone up to use the fib on. For this method, that's not what I'm doing. I put the fib line at the top of the 1 hr candle which was followed by a couple of inside bars before one closed higher than the line. Then a trade is taken on retrace back to that point. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Actually - I hope not to confuse things, but thought I'd show a quick pic of a couple of 50% entries. I don't want to go in to too much detail here as this thread is about breakout and retrace back to S/R areas. Think of this as a variation - I use this a lot especially on 4hr charts for continuation trades. If anyone wants further explanation I can post something about it - the pic should give you an idea of what I'm doing. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi ya Pharley Is it like so or I've made some mistakes?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
HI mate - yes it looks right. If anyone wants to know more I can start a different thread for that one as I want to keep this one for the method described on page 1. Then eventually I may create a thread to bring everything together! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Thanks Pharley That's working out a treat.. being a chicken n all I took a quick 19pip scalp on that.. cheers

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Great thread, Pharley! That last chart by Ramjet is actually a great SR area as well. So the 50% entry + at SR area should be the best combo for this. Would love to hear more about your opinion on 50% entries.

ah ok, thanks

Good point, thanks Pharley!

Hi Pharley, I guess it will be very valuable if you will put all together. You said earlier that we always have to consider trend and major S/R areas on daily TF. So it means that you enter on position on H1 only to direction with trend? I saw few pics from you where you entered countertrends position also. Could you explain it a little bit more? THank you.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I'm keeping an eye on USD/CAD.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
[quote=pharley;8965708]Actually - I hope not to confuse things, but thought I'd show a quick pic of a couple of 50% entries. I don't want to go in to too much detail here as this thread is about breakout and retrace back to S/R areas. Think of this as a variation - I use this a lot especially on 4hr charts for continuation trades. If anyone wants further explanation I can post something about it - the pic should give you an idea of what I'm doing. Cheers Pharley {image}[/quote ​Thank You this is excellent especially for inexperienced traders like me and most probably for the experienced one as well. One can only be grateful for that.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Thanks Sajid for sharing your thoughs around your trade and also for giving insides to your approach regarding the round numbers, very interesting, I will consider this in my plannings.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
​Not a pair I normally look at, I might change my stance having seen this.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Mhons - yes counter trend trading is a bit tricky. I won't go in to it here - just trying to keep this one for this break and retrace method of getting entries. It does tie in with other methods I've mentioned on here - but I can't stress enough to learn just one good method and stick with it at first. Master it, get good at it, make money from it. Then look around at something else later. That goes for 50% retracements as well - do't worry too much about it just now. You can learn it a bit later and add it to your trading tool box. In a nut shell, when you pull it all together you get this:- 1) Take major S/R areas off weekly and daily charts; 2) Look for PA candles/set ups coming off those major S/R areas to get you in an initial trade with clear SL and target areas for profit; 3) Look for a method of entering continuation trades (this minor S/R break retrace, or 50% retrace, or inside bars etc); 4) Look for a method that maintains minimal risk and works towards zero risk as you enter those multiple trades. All these concepts are in my first thread and some within this one. Yes indeed - perhaps I need another thread pulling everything together. When I've got time perhaps. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #188 ---
HI Rub, How did you go with the USDCAD? There was a slightly earlier trade that could have been had on the 1 hr chart. I can see a retrace on the current PA on a 15 min chart but not the 1 hour. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes thanks for that Sajid - it's an interesting approach. I hope you have lots of success with it! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi Jack - yes it's a pair I trade as well. As the AUD tends to move well, then so do things like EURAUD and GBPAUD - the bonus being price moves a lot more pips with these pairs that say AUDUSD. For sure you'll find heaps of set ups on these. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Pharley, 2nd day using your method, :-) happy to share the success with EJ. Set for GU but did not trigger else would have made more pips (demo at this moment but still am glad). A question i have is, is there a diff where you mark the close or high as S/R? The way i see it, is that there is a group out there who prefer the close and another who prefers the high and one of these groups win and they takes turn. So i subjectively use the close or the high depending on the chart at that point, am i right to say that?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
It hasn't triggered yet, got the order in at 1.2795 with a 30 pip stop.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
NU pair . 30 pips taken .. im using 21 simple moving average line in 1hr time frame

--- 帖子 #194 ---
HI Firefires, and well done! Close or high? Well as nothing is clear cut - quite often it can be the top, other times it can be the close. Many times it's somewhere inbetween. This is something that you either have a hard rule for or leave it for individuals to decide. On this method I'm using the high, but to be honest I'm looking at price action prior to the candle in question to see if I can get further clues as to where I'll get that SR line in. This is where the concept of an area rather than strict line comes in. You'll see on the chart you post that the trend is up, but price retraces way past the high of each wave - then clearly it's good to move that entry lower than the high as you're expecting it to go down near the close of the candle. See how price is giving you hints as to how far it will retrace? That doesn't happen every time, but many times it does. It's all about looking at that price action leading up to where you want to trade. I'd say you did exactly the right thing by lowering your entry point! This is one of the reason trading is hard - I can't give you a hard rule for where as shown in this very example. But people look for 0 or 1, black or white entries. In truth, it's all shades of grey. The best thing to do is learn to analyse the PA and pick the best looking entries. It's another reason I'm not too keen on EA's - they work with yes/no instead of a nod to discretionary trading where you're using your skill and experience. Hope that helps and thanks for the question! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yea man, I am so sad i didn't put a sell limit for that gbpaud move. the worst thing is i have been monitoring that pair because it works so well with the way pharley is showing us. Never thought it would retrace so much during Asia.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
???? why don´t you thought that. Rate decision!

--- 帖子 #197 ---
had a look at it, why are you so sure that you want to make this trade?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi US - terrific! Always nice to take 30 pips. Hey if that 21SMA on the 1hr works for you that's great! It's always worth noting that any method can be adapted to suit your own style of trading - take the best bits of a method and make it better/different/suitable for you. Don't believe the traders who tell you that you MUST trade like this. That's just BS. If you have a solid method, perhaps incorporating other methods and you tweak it to suit yourself and it works, there is nothing wrong with that! Keep going mate - doing well! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #199 ---
True, but it didn't move because of the aud news, the GBP was wilding out last night lol.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi there Pharley, very interesting method Im keen to look into it more closely.For now i dont really have time to test it but Im wondering how you doing with it? Can you provide some stats for Your trades? Im interested in hit rate and avarage win/loss? Statement from meta trader 4 will provide you with this stats automaticly users of this method are welcome to provide stats as well

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi! I have attempted to write an indicator to draw the S/R levels for this method. Red = Higher TimeFrame S/R Level Orange = Medium TimeFrame S/R Level Green = Lower TimeFrame S/R Level Please let me know if you agree with the way the levels are set up? Cheers Vlad

--- 帖子 #202 ---
​ Hi, Is it possible to have such indicator for MQ4? I am not able to open or download ex.4 on my MT4 Platform, or if You know how to do it please would You be so kind to tell me ?

Well done mate!!!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi Songok, I can't really give a stat for just this method as I use a variety of methods to trade such as this one, 50% retracements (a couple of different ways), using pin bars, inside bars, first touches off major S/R. So the stats I have cover all my trades - I generally use cTrader as well rather than mt4 or mt5. Having said that, over the past 12 months my win rate is about 71% for longs and 68% for shorts over some 270 trades using all the methods I like to trade. I'm trying to improve that all the time of course, but happy to be winning more than losing. Cheers Pharley

Pending long on AUDUSD

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi Vlad ☺ What made u take the upper breakout level instead of the lower on this trade, just curious. Im not saying its wrong or right, i just like to hear youre thoughts behind this trade. eur/aud and nzd/usd has similar levels now Cheers all

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes I have a pending on the NZDUSD as well. I am still trying to get used to picking up on the trend. So in the meanwhile I am using the 50 SMA (red line) as the a guide. So only taking longs above the 50, and shorts below it. That's why I didnt take the earlier short. Vlad

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi ya Vlad, Alaska, Both areas actually look real good from what I understand of Pharley's method.. The top S/R has a solid S/R as the 2 local candles have almost no wicks so solid points for reaction The lower S/R is also in confluence with the 50% retrace Target would be maybe a 1:2RR as strong trouble area it's running into.. Cheers, Adrian

I have to say that this method is so powerful just go with trend a jump into trend in retracements, add to positions till end and enjoy pips, that´s all what you need with this system. Thanks to all contributors especially pharley. It is Wednesday and I have 10% account Attached Image (click to enlarge) gain with this system. Enough for this week. Green pips to all.

Hi US, That's great news - again! Keep watching that pair - could be more room to move yet. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #232 ---
HI Mhons, Nice chart mate - and well done on your trades. It's great to see so many good trades with this method. And it's also terrific to see that people are seeing what I saw when I was originally looking at this simple method. It's ok describing a nice looking, simple method, but it's another thing altogether to actually get decent trades and profits from it. You're correct in looking at the multiple entries - manage that risk, move the stops when you're placing the next trade and watch your account get a huge boost. I'm truly happy for you mate - I hope this can make your trading (and others) trading really profitable. If anyone has been really struggling with being profitable, this could the very simple method to turn things around. It would be great to hear form anyone else who is having success with this. Cheers Pharley

hi pharley in this .... how come i take trade? can you explain? please

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi ramzam, Hard to tell from that 1 pic. I don't have access to copper charts and never traded it. I can see where a short would be but with the PA on the left so close, it's not worth it. But I can't tell from the picture if that's major S/R or not. You'd have to zoom out to 4hr, daily and weekly to see the big picture (market structure) to see what's happening. Try looking at that first before deciding on any trade. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #247 ---
do you see the big red candle left, are you willing to fight against this strong candle? I dont think so had a look at it, heres a picture, just my view hope that is ok for the OP, i know that this is not regarding to the thread

--- 帖子 #248 ---
ok understand pharley... oh is it means further down ? maximumguita

--- 帖子 #249 ---
if you look at the weekly chart, yes there is a little room for a down till Friday use pullbacks as entries and be aware of the lows in the monthly chart! As i said, a little!!! room and this is just my view. Dont trade it blind, the price is very low could be a nice long in the next time

Hi Max - that's fine mate. We're all here to help one another. You're right in pointing out (for any trade) look to the major S/R areas and where price is now - does it have room to move a goodly amount of pips before perhaps getting stuck or rebounding. Cheers Pharley

Hello pharley , super, super job !!! Thank you so much! my first trade , with different eyes . Please tell me if something is wrong . sorry for my bad English GBP/YEN short 154.50

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Schrupper and welcome. While that setup seems valid, when you look at the daily chart, you can see price is down near some major support. Price is currently ranging between about 153 and 162.50. Yes that's a big range, but as price is at the lower of these extreme, I'd be hanging out for a signal to buy. If price falls to below the low at 151.64, then I'd be looking to short. Always look at the larger timeframes to see where the current price is in relation to market structure. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Try it for yourself, I'm enjoying mine. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi there, Re Vlad's indicator - it's not bad. Some of the levels might be missing, but by all means give it a go. I prefer to use my eye with these levels. Sideways markets - Well it depends. If there is a clear range and the volume is there to move it up and down, then you can try to trade between the range. If there is no volume clearly pushing price up to the high of the range and down to the low, you've got 2 choices - you can try to trade, or just stay out. Trading a range where there is no trend requires a different method, one which I won't cover here. Don't forget, when you look at the charts and decide that it's a messy day, deciding to stay out of the market and go do something else is a valid decision - it is a trading decision. It can often save your account. Why risk it? Save your trading pot for another day as there are always other days to trade. Look for the best set ups in trending markets - any half decent trading method will work in a good trending market. Yes things might pick up in a bit, but to be honest, I don't want to be sat in front of a screen just waiting. Remember, it's Friday as well. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #265 ---
your picture was from H4 there is also a big candle. If you know that you just trade a possible Pullback than it is ok and with a little luck maybe you catch the old downtrend. But even for a Pullback the entry right now would be the worst thing that you could do. Just my opinion

Hi there Pharley I Have been recently interested in minor S/R myself and would like to suggest, in order to see the levels easier, I use the zigzag indicator with the inputs changed to 3 2 1 It just makes it easier to see those recent S/R levels. Here is a chart as an example of what I mean... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chris

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Chris, Thanks for your input mate. I'm not that keen on using indicators, but if it works for you, that's great. I had a quick look at the ZZ with those settings on daily, 4hr and 1hr charts and I can see it misses quite a few, especially on the lower TF. When you've got used to seeing these levels on the charts, there's no substitute for the old eyeballs! But like I say, if something you've found works, then use it. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Re: Cad News on Friday. I do not think it was luck since the trends on the higher time frame eg weekly was bearish. My entry Sell before the news was 1.2749 and the rest is history.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi Pharley, Here the analysis of my trades from last week (6.6.-10.6.16). In general I made +281 pips using your method (9 win trades, 5 loss trades, 3 BE) all done on H1 chart. Due to my daily work I can only determine entries before London session. Analyzing my 17 trade I recognized 2 reasons for wins / losses: there must be space enough to the next D1 level always win trades if 200 EMA on H1 and H4 (for confirmation) have a clear slope and are pointing to the same direction and the trades are in the direction of the slope I feel very comfortable with your method and will continue next week improving the entry / exit decisions. Thank you very much for sharing this.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
hi maddin do you trade on pair GBPUSD?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Putrimawarfx, Generally I am also looking for GBPUSD but last week I had no trades on this pair.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi Maddin, Many thanks for your analysis. Always nice to get upwards of 300 pips for a week. Very nice. Yes I absolutely agree that there must be space on the daily chart for a trade to play out, otherwise you're just trading in to a S/R area and odds are that it may lose. That's why I always say, get the major S/R areas in on the weekly and daily BEFORE moving to lower timeframes to trade. I've been asked if I draw the major S/R any different - yes I do, only in terms of this - for me they are a solid line with minor ones being dotted. You could use different colours if you want. I took a look at the 200 EMA on the charts and that seems to be nice and useful. It may keep people from entering iffy trades (not great set ups) and can be used as a good filter. Many thanks for the analysis and suggestions. Again if anyone finds the 200 EMA useful and it works for you, by all means use it or anything else. The 200 EMA is a good standard one to use that many more advanced/experienced traders use as well, so there's no harm in being in synch with those guys. Cheers Pharley

Hi Albert, Thanks for your post. You'll probably find that the stochastic, although useful in some aspects of trading, doesn't really deliver what it promises. Looking at your chart, I flicked open my chart on the NZDCAD (not a pair I trade) and can see you're buying into a resistance area. If you look at a daily chart you'll see why. If you make your charts really clean and zoom out, starting with weekly charts and then going to daily charts, you can easily identify the major S/R or supply/demand areas that can be drawn on the chart. Then when you go to lower timeframes, you can easily see these major areas and be ready for when price gets to them. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Well appreciated Pharley. Thanks for pointing that out. Its a pity that I don't look to higher TF. All my analysis and decisions are based on the current TF "live". I want to stick to the set rules. Only two things can happen; it either hits my SL or puts me in profits.. Regards.. Al

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi all - thought I'd do a quick post on what I"m doing on weekly, daily and 1 hour charts. I've just done this for someone else, but it may be useful here. I look at the weekly chart first - see pic 1 which is GBPJPY. I draw a couple of S/R areas around where price currently is. I'm not interested in drawing heaps of lines all over the place. Just a couple above and below current price. Pic 2 shows the daily chart - I do the same again. I'm looking for a couple of levels above and below the current price action. Solid lines are weekly levels, dotted lines are daily. Pic 3 shows a 1 hr charts. The yellow lines are the current (I'm looking at last week here), swing highs and lows - the S/R areas I can easily spot. Trend is bearish so I'm only looking to short. All my short trades will target either the yellow swing low I see there, or daily S/R dotted level. The red lines mark the minor S/R on the hourly chart that I can see and trade. I hope that makes sense - I keep charts clean of clutter so I can easily see when price is approaching major S/R levels. By having one type of line for weekly and another for daily (or different colours) I can tell instantly what level price is approaching. Keeping charts simple like this and drawing in major S/R areas is key to seeing where price could get to and will help enormously with trading. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #286 ---
No worries Albert - try to check the higher TF from weekly down - you can really see what's happening and it can save your bacon!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Took this one. I am comfortable with the risk.....

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Albert - can you let us know what makes you buy at that point? Just trying to understand your system. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #290 ---
​This is a pretty strong bearish trend you're trying to fight. If you do want to trade the 5 min, why not try and pick a with trend entry like this one earlier?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Jack - that's a good example of this method with a 5m chart! I'm pretty sure it works with all timeframes so if someone is partial to a bit of 1m or 5m scalping, it could be pretty successful for that as well. Thanks Pharley

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Great stuff! Im on standby with trading. I tend to have losing trades on monday usually D: just watching market for now.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Let me attempt an explanation to what I am doing. I stick with one TF, other time frames do not influence my analysis of the current TF. My entries are per the thread rules; -Identify a S/R level - Place a pending order after it has been broken. I use the stockastic to identify those levels. I'll illustrate with my current trades.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
That's good Saruhn - any time we're not comfortable trading we should leave it for the day and pick up again when we see good trades. A valid stance to take. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Albert - ah now I understand. I hope it work well for you mate - personally I'd take off the stochs and just trade the PA, but I'm not here to tell anyone "should do this, do that". If something works for you, then terrific and go for it! If this method can fit in with what anyone is doing now, or you can tweak things, or just get something out of it, that's all good! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Agreed. But I want price to lead the way. This current picture shows another level broken and setup for another entry. Some use moving averages etc to determine trends but trends develop from these simple setups. Again I agree that I may be going against the trend and the buy trade may not go far and same applies to the reverse. I appreciate the concerns, but let me try this out. Lets see how it goes.......

--- 帖子 #297 ---
. Thanks Pharley.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
You go for it Albert - the very best way to test these things is to do it live with small lot sizes - minimal loss if things don't work out. There's millions of different ways to trade - it's finding something that works for you and mastering it that matters!

While waiting to pick a trade on 1hr, do you mean that whenever you spot any higher timeframes level close you your 1hr entry, you ignore the trade? I don't really understand the essence of the higher timeframe level.Thanks

Hi Pharley/Fellow members, Is the first few posts explaining the analysis still the one you all are using? Regards. S

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi dbest, I use the higher timeframes for a couple of things. When you're looking at higher TF's, you can more easily see the direction of the current price action. It gives me the direction bias I"m after. When I draw the major SR areas in around the current price, I use these as targets - minor SR areas are used for entries with targets at major levels or at least 1:1 risk reward or better. If price is close to a major level and I see a entry set up, I might not take it if there is no room to get a good profit before price hits the major level. In that case I would just leave it, wait and see what happens at the major level. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Specul8r, Yes - just using higher levels timeframes to set major SR areas then moving down to 1hr charts (or 30m, 15m) to look for entries. Some have even shown 5m entries! Cheers Pharley

hi Pharley,according to your analysis on post 285 how do you determine the week trend on euraud i think its buy now but its in a range on 4hr,or better can you analyse this pair based on you approach as it is now.thanks

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Timilehin and thanks for your question. See charts below for week,day, 4hr and 1hr. All I can say is the type of PA that the pair is currently in - a range - I keep well away from. I need to see it trending before I'll take a trade on this one. You have a much better chance of success in entering when things are moving in an overall direction. Of course you could play the range up and down - different strategy and I tend not to range trade. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi - at the moment I'm a bit wary of trading fx due to the impending Brexit vote. I did take a speculative gold long trade the other day which I'm hanging on to for now. Rumours are that if the UK votes to leave, gold may shoot up to $1350 or even $1400 so I bought a small amount just in case. Plus gold has been trending up. I'm also working on something else which is a longer term swing trading method that looks very interesting. I'll see how it goes. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I agree. I've been phasing out of trading the GBP, EUR, CHF pairs - the increased volatility will present opportunities for some, but it's too risky for me - I'll be well out of the market by the time the vote comes. Good brokers are starting to increase their margin level requirements (if yours isn't then be very careful - and consider changing them - whether it is another Black Wednesday or not, if your broker isn't actively managing the risk then they are playing fast and loose). Pharley - thanks for all your input here - it's a solid thread and your generous input and patience is to be commended. Using your approach has now helped increase my account by 101% in a couple of weeks (using approx 5% risk per trade). You've helped provide a renewed clarity and focus for me and I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Yes I agree - we all must be careful for now. I think the vote is next week - June 23 - so go easy on trading for now. Hey - GREAT results mate! It's good you're keeping the risk low and it shows that terrific returns can be had while maintaining control over any losses. I spent a fair but of time on my other thread talking about entering multiple times and keeping risk to a minimum and still getting good results. Well done mate - keep it up! And don't forget me when you're a squillionaire! Pharley

--- 帖子 #330 ---

Hi Pharley, Â Can I ask a question? Â Attached is UJ H1, it's been in a range box and it's really 'dirty', chopping around, looks so much like a centipede. Â In this scenario, do you wait until the box broken with momentum and take a trade at the retest, or will you buy the low and sell the top inside the box? Thanks in advance for your time!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
HI LinFX - at the moment we're in a very special set of circumstances which is why much of the price action has reduced enormously. The vote for Britain to leave the EU (or not) is next week, and the outcome will have a fairly major impact economically. So you find that people and institutions are trading as much - hence the lack of trending action. Yes you can trade the range - sell at the top, buy at the bottom. But I tend not to trade ranges and stick with trending action. I this particular case withe UJ, I wont be trading it until it shows a clear trend again or any pair for that matter, until we're over this Brexit period. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi Pharley, I have a question regarding this. How do you identify trend? How do you know that a pair is trending? Do you look at higher time frame and only take positions based on higher time frame context?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Great thread, Pharley! Thank you so much for your time and effort. One question I have, when you stack orders to trade from one to the next daily SR level, what will you do if a order gets stopped out? I.E. you are 3 orders deep, and all your orders get taken out with the stoploss of the last order, as you always put all your SLs in one place - will you try to get in again, or is the run dead for you? Also, do you need any price action confirmation on the D1 like Pinbars or sth like that? Or do you watch price approach SR on H1, and see if you get a rejection, break, and simply enter on retrace? Thank you mate!

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Sorry, and when you stack your orders - are the 3% in relation to the floating P&amp;L or do you always relate to the balance before you entered your first order? Thank you so much.

I would say, look for higher highs/lower lows, but worth checking higher time frames to see if its ranging there.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi Jun, Yes I look at the higher timeframes, draw in the S/R areas, then look at where price is in relation to those. If it's hit a resistance at the top and is travelling downwards towards support, then it's a downtrend - typically it shows lower highs and lower lows with the swings. THe reverse for an upwards trend. If you zoom out on a high time frame it's easier to see the overall market structure and trend. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi King, Yes I will try to get in again when I see price starting to move in the trend direction again - IF there is room available before price gets to major S/R areas. Regarding certain bars on daily TF - yes I do look for those as well and will trade them. The method described here is only 1 facet of how I trade. Things like pin bars (or other PA candle set ups) at S/R areas are things I'm always looking for. If you think about it, when price is at a S/R area, there has to be a setup (for me anyway) that I can see before I enter. Many times at major S/R I will use a 50% retracement set up to get in the first trade, then add to it with other trades based on other set ups, one of them being the method described here. You have to develop a toolbox that contains different ways to trade, of set ups. Not many - only 2 to 4 will do - keep it simple. Regarding the 1 hour chart - typically I like watching the 4hr chart when price gets t major S/R areas. It's a better measure of what may happen with price. If I'm entering (adding to already taken positions) after the first one, then I'll use this method. Most often my first position will be taken using a 4hr chart and many times it's a 50% retrace of PA minor swings. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I always try to keep risk around the 3% to 6% area, no matter how many trades I'm in. But that's only a guide - I'm much more comfortable thinking about $ risk rather than %. That's because of this - I have an amount of money in my trading pot, but that's not all the money I have. Lets make the maths easy for me - If I have $100,000 in the bank and $10,000 in my trading pot, I'm only trading with 10% of my funds. Now if I risk 20% of that pot - $2,000, that seems a lot, but it's only 2% of my total funds so I'm happy to risk that amount. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thank you so much, mate! Helps a lot. I am intrigued by stacking orders in order to get shitloads of dope out of one move. Will try my best to see what I can do. Got some loss orders yday, my mistake.. see whether it goes better today. Have to get used to drawing those levels.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Schrupper - for all your trades, try to make sure you're getting at least 1:1 risk rewards or better. Also, remember to look at the higher daily timeframes and draw in major levels of S/R first. I can see the eurcad short was shorting into a support area. From the look of it, it may have worked out, but it's always better to have plenty of room between major S/R levels. I'll post some more pics later today to explain a bit. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Pyramiding is a valid way of really boosting your account, but you have to know what you're doing as it's all about risk management. Actually I was doing that on gold the last few days and it went very well. Gold price came down last night a bit and hit stops, but they were in front of where I'd bought - only the last trade lost, but the winners gave an overall profit of about 10% of the pot which I'm happy with. I go in to this multiple entry area in great detail in my other thread - it shows how to mange the risk, ow to move stops up etc. The trick is to look at weekly and daily charts - draw in the major S/R areas and trade from one to the the other, entering multiple times as you ride the price up or down. Take 90% of the move as a profit target. To do this tye of pyramiding, you need to have clear in your mind how you're going to enter (what set ups you're going to enter on). The method described here is one such method you can use. Hope that helps - yes for sure, practice seeing those major and minor S/R levels! Cheers Pharley P.S I prefer to think of it as heaps of $ rather than sh!t loads of dope!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Yes i am pouring over your other thread at the moment! Such interesting stuff, so powerful. Will post my pyramiding attempts here to make heaps of $ . Can you share your watchlist for today? You posted it one time and that really helped to see what you are looking for !

--- 帖子 #347 ---
this is what i did and where i take wrong entry... because i take resistance area as breakout area.. so thought to buy and loss holding

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi Ramzam, I took a look at the copper charts and this is what I see for that price action. Pic 1 is a daily chart with a couple of S/R areas marked on it. You can see you bought at or near the major turning level at resistance. After price bounces off that and southwards, we should only be looking to take shorts. Pic 2 is a 4 hour chart of the same with resistance and support marked. What I do is measure the last movement between these major support and resistance and take 90% of that move as my target for all entries. That target is marked as a thin black line. I'm now only looking for short entries as I'm expecting price to move to the major support. There are no guarantees of course, but PA is powerful. Pic 3 shows a 1 hour chart of same with potential entries using this method of break and retrace to minor S/R In effect you're looking to do the following: 1) Weekly or daily chart - draw major S/R areas - the most recent; 2) Price reaches one of these. Look at where price would go to - where is the next target? Take this off the major S/R areas you've drawn. Measue 90% of that move and draw a line - that's your target for all entries. (As a side note - if price has already moved away from major S/R area, still do the analysis, and wait for the next break/retrace of minor S/R set up to enter. You may have missed some of the move but at least you'll get some); 3) Now look at how to enter your first trade. If I'm on the 4hr chart I'm looking for pins, railroads, 50% retracement etc. If I'm on the 1 hr I can use this method of break and retrace to minor S/R; 4) In this example I can see a break and retrace as the first entry. Don't go all in - take a small position. You'll make money later from multiple entries. Remember - no guarantees, so keep the lot size small in case price decides to go the other way; 5) As price moves in your favour, look for further entries - there are quite a few on this chart. Every trade has a target at the 90% line/target level; 6) As you enter another trade, move SL to the last swing high above the PA; 7) Keep entering - either same size lots or slowly increase it. Watch the risk level all the way. By the time you've entered trade 3, you're normally home free - what I mean by that is you can't lose. That's because if trade 3 loses, the gains from trade 1 and 2 outweigh the loss from trade 3. As you move in to trade 4 and trade 5, your profits really being to grow. Move ALL the stop losses you have for all trades down to the new stop loss for the new trade. I did this live in my other thread and gained about 60% of the pot in 3 days. 8) Remember to keep entering as long as the risk reward is good - at least 1:1 or more - anything less, don't enter. So that's how you could play this one. How many of these do you need to get in 1 month? Probably 1. But you could probably find at least 1 of these a week. You want to be looking for good trending action between major S/R areas. It's SO IMPORTANT to get the major S/R drawn and target those - well, 90% of the move (or 80% - whatever you're comfortable with). The gains are huge and risks minimal. Have a read of my other thread if you want to see more of that type of thing. Hope that helps, Cheers Pharley

oh god.... really you are opening my eyes to how see the chart.... really i will follow this way and now only i got understand... and do minimal risk trades with max reward hearty thanks....

--- 帖子 #351 ---
based on this read i drawn .. is this right please tell

--- 帖子 #352 ---
So to double check if i am correct. You use Weekly and Daily to draw major support and resistance lines. If recently price has been rejected on that level and is starting to produce higher high or lower lows which indicates changes in trend you start to look to entering the trade. From my understanding you use weekly and daily support as area to look into entering. And once it has started to form a change in direction on 1H chart you start to enter until the next resistance or support line?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Dear pharley, thank you for another clear explanation of this system. Do you think its okay to make entries on 4H TF because H1 is too fast and I cant be at screen whole day. So approach to enter on 50% retraces of swing or after close 4H candle above yesterday high or enter after retracement to this yesteraday close?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
HI - yes that's right. But I do look at 4hr as well as 1 hr charts for entries. Particularly the 4hr for the first entry - I tends to give a clearer signal. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #355 ---
HI Mhon - yes absolutely - I also use the 4hr. The 4hr is also terrific for 50% retracement entries - see below a couple of images.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Like I mentioned earlier, you have to have a toolbox with a few different things - 1) a few different ways to enter, whether that be by continuation or reversal PA candles, retracements etc; 2) how you identify major and minor S/R areas; 3) how you will manage risk on a single trade; 4) how you will manage risk on multiple entries 5) how/where you will exit at target or exit due to PA going against you. 6) Your daily routine (checking calendar, checking S/R, checking market structure etc) 7) Trading plan - write all this stuff down when you have it sorted and refer to it; 8) Find the perfect set ups on charts and take a copy of the chart - put this in your best set ups library and refer to it often. Just a bit of food for thought! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Great input pharley! I assume you check your SR once peer week MAX. as on the daily and weekly well it takes some time for new SR to develop..

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi mate - yes, I normally check the major S/R areas on a Sunday and draw/redraw ready for the week. Doesn't take too long. Cheers

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Pharley! Thanks for your previous reply. I just consumed your latest food of thought and got some questions again. I wonder if there is a possibility for me to know your daily trading routine? how it looks like? Also, do you use any special software (edgewonk, etc), blog or website to record your trading? something like a private journal? Or you actually just store it in a folder consist of charts with marking? Cheers Lin

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi LinFX, My daily trading routine - it gets interrupted quite often - a consequence of having 3 kids! But it's nothing special - I've already done my analysis on a Sunday concerning major S/R areas and market structure. Before I do anything, I open up the fx calendar - I want to know what's coming up today, especially if it's red flag stuff. Generally I ted to avoid trading when those are happening. If I'm in a trade, I'll tighten up any SL for the news coming out. The I'll open the charts and start looking what's happened - particularly interested in yesterday daily candle - pins, inside bars, railroads, piercing etc etc. Anything happening near major S/R, anything happening near a minor S/R? If I've got trades open, of course I'll check those to see if SL can be moved or i they're still running. Then check every 4hrs if I'm on the 4hr charts, or every hours for the hourly charts - assuming I can. Sometimes it's difficult to check every hour. That's it really - I don't spend time on fxdaily or any other fx news site. I've found they can be as wrong as often as I can. Besides, I want to analyse the charts and come to my own conclusions. I generally use good old excel - good as anything else. I have used mxfxbook in the past as it does some good analysis on your trades. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hey pharley, I would like to ask you, how many currencies do you trade or watch on a regular Basis? Thx. D.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi - all of the majors and most of their crosses - so there's about 22 pairs on my platform currently, plus gold, dax30, ft100, F40 and US30. However, I'd say that most of my trades are on AUDUSD, GBPAUD, GBPJPY, USDCHF and Gold. Oh, and Dax30. Dax30 and gold can provide some huge moves and gains, and much can be said for gbpjpy as well. The AUDUSD, NZDUSD and a few others move less, but are fairly reliable in what they do, i.e. respect price action. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Ok, I see. one last question. What would you say, how many trades on averages you do every week? Just a number! Thx. D.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hello , you can please look at what is wrong here . There should only be one instance where I last Sunday the S / R lines would have to draw . Had the entrances to the S / R lines H4 in H1 been correct or wait for S / R in the Daily ?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hi Dirk, It does really vary - sometimes I can see a few trades in 1 day that I want to enter and other times it's just a couple of times in a week. Let's say 1 a day on average. Cheers

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Schrupper, I think what I see is there's too much stuff on your charts. Try and get rid of most of that - zigzags, period separators etc. Just concentrate on the price and the turning points. If you're happy with all those things on the your charts, that's fine - you'll probably be able to concentrate more on price if they're not there though. See day chart of mine below as an example - I try to keep it as simple as possible. The AUDUSD wasn't much of a pair to trade this last week.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I only had 2 trades last week, both on audusd. At the end they gave me +0 pips (1 loss 1 win). I most likely wont trade next week either due to all the news regarding gbp. There were some other trades i wanted to take and luckily enough i didn't..it would've resulted in losses because the PA was not good at all, and the market would just range and act weird. Not taking a position IS a position imo . When the dust settles it will hopefully be time to make some trades.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Definitely mate - play it safe. Taking no position due to PA is taking a position! Cheers

Hi mate would it be possible for you to show on some of the pairs you trade how do determen if it is trending in realtime and how it is done ? Still struggling with this i guess. Thanks best regards

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Jgadefelth, The only way I determine if it's trending is to look at the larger timeframes like weekly or daily. I can determine form those charts which way the market is going, and where price is in the market structure. Attached is a pic which is way more messy (too many things on it for me) that shows 3 different ways to show a downtrend. 1. An uptrend channel is broken to the downside 2. Lower highs and lower lows registered 3. EMA50 sloping down. Once you've got overall direction on the high timeframe, then if you want to move to 4hr or 1hr chart (or 5m, 15m - whatever), you're only concerned with taking in this example, shorts. Of course price will go up during a down trend and down during an uptrend. These are pullbacks, retraces. Use them to enter in the direction of the trend or add to positions. It's difficult for me to explain it an easier than that. You must be able to see on a daily chart if price is going up or down or sideways? Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi pharley, hope you had a good weekend! Been backtesting the strategy and having some ok results with my limited experience. A question i have is trade management: when you stack, you move your first SL to breakeven / at the SL of the 2nd order. So until then, you dont touch the stoploss of the first order? You only move it to breakeven when you see a stacking opportunity, or are there other times when you move your SL to BE without the possibility of a 2nd order? Thanks man

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Eu weekly sideways ? and daily in a uptrend ? Thanks for your explenation.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi King, When entering a 2nd trade, I move SL from the first trade to the SL location of the second. Sometimes that means the SL on the first trade is in front of entry (I can't lose on that trade), sometimes at BE, sometimes it isn't fully safe yet. No, I don't touch the SL on the first trade until I'm able to enter a second. Note that when I'm looking at trying to get on a good run, my first trade is taken at half my usual risk to minimise losses. If I'm trading what I think is the potential for 6 trade entries, then I move all SL up/down to the same location when I enter the next trade. If I'm trading just say, a 4hr 50% retracement that can get me 1:3 risk reward, I will more than likely move SL to BE + 5 pips once price is at 1:2 RR level. I would re-analyse my target location in line with major/minor SR areas to make sure my analysis is correct. Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #375 ---
HI - see below. I can see eurusd in a rising channel at the moment. But I don't think I'll be trading anything this week. The slightest rumour on the Brexit front may send prices crazy. I prefer to wait until things have calmed down. Cheers

HI - for those wanting to have a look at how I enter multiple trades using minimal risk and moving stops, have a look at my other thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=551541 which shows everything there on the first few posts. Oh I forgot to say - you can flick through the thread to follow the live trades I took as I was writing the thread. Someone though it wasn't possible to trade that way and get good results - I do love a challenge! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #377 ---
That helps heaps, yes, thank you!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Yes rising channel on daily or 4h. This is basic but i find it hard the trend is also how mutch you zoom in or out and you see things differently so perhapps you have to have rules about how far back you go or zoom out to see the trend. below 4h am not sure weekly play a big role. In a weekly uptrend there is still big retraces that are tradeble on timeframes below 4h, do you agree ? What is a big trend on 15 minutes is just a small retrace on weekly chart or even in 15 minutes if you zoom out more. Best regards

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi - yes of course there are minor trends within larger trends. It all comes down to what you want to trade. E.G if you want to trade the 15m chart, you probably want to take the trend from the 4hr charts. If 1m, then probably a 1 hour chart trend. I take daily and weekly as I generally trade daily, 4hr charts and sometimes 1 hour. Even with 1 hour charts I want to be on the side of the larger trend and market structure. That's because most of my trades are targeting major SR areas. Cheers Pharley

SL hit

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I don't think it was a correct entry as per the rules posted by Pharley. Neither the SL seems to be logical. It was very exposed to be hit. You need to set your SL few pips below/above the previous swing low/high. And i suggest you should set your TP as per the bar close price on previous swing high/low. My USDCAD shorts taken last week. Two trades of lot 0.02 size were initiated. Trade#1 TP was set at target 1 slightly few pips more than the SL and Trade# 2 TP was set at previous swing low above the consolidation at the level. SL for both of the trades were above previous minor high and consolidation at the level.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
You exactly took the opposite trade at the level. This level already broken, so its no more a support. It will now act as resistance. And by looking it your chart, the level has proven its worth as resistance. Therefore are enough evidences that the level is now resistance not a support. So you took the wrong trade my brother and SL hit was obvious. Always remember that once a level broken then it will change its role. And new consolidation below/above that level is confirmation that the role is changed.

Dear pharley, I made few analysis on charts, with your method, could you check if I am right, in pics below on W1 we are on ressistance, D1 short-term uptrend, notable wicks on blue rectangle, at H4 we are in uptrend channel, now we will wait what price will do bounce down from resistance, after that signal would be close of 4h candle below yesterday low or maybe after that wait for retrace to this level. Or broke above rezistance and then wait for retrace to start opening longs. Of course there is problem with Brexit but I think AUD/CAD pair is not so vulnereable.

Hi Mhons - yes that seems reasonable. I've been having a little break away from fx for the last coupe of days. This week will probably give some nice opportunities but I'm sort of staying out of it. Mainly the GBP pairs could be very volatile with others not as much. But it's nice to have a break every now and again! Some of the price action is tempting, but I can wait. Cheers Ph

Hi, Someone has asked me how do I know a S/R level is significant or not. I thought I'd post something on it here. Generally, the longer the timeframe charts you're looking at, the better. If I take a weekly chart of gbpjpy (see below) and draw the significant SR area on, they're pretty easy to spot. Now how do I know these are significant? Well it's because price has turned at these points in the past, or has flipped around them. It's important to get these weekly levels in, then when price approaches them you're aware that these are significant levels. I would encourage you to pick any chart, go to the weekly setting, draw in significant SR levels from the past, then go to daily or 4hr charts in a more recent time and see what price does when it reaches them. You'll see that price does something significant - it will bounce off them, or it will go through and retrace back to the line. Many times this happens - if the line is just blasted through and price doesn't retrace to it, take it as a sign that the level isn't valid as a significant level anymore. The chart attached shows major SR areas from the past in blocks with a line through them to carry it forward. The circles are where price comes back to that line. Go have a look yourself at price action at that point - you'll see pin bars, engulfing bars, flip trade set ups etc etc. Price always does SOMETHING at these levels, which is an opportunity to be taken advantage of. I attach a second pic of just 1 recent area on the 4hr chart - these happen all the time at these levels. These are what I consider to be significant SR levels. The ones inbetween are minor SR levels only - useful for getting in or adding to positions. Take a look across just a few pairs at weekly levels, then go to daily or 4hr and look at the trade opportunities that exist. There are heaps of them. That's why I tend not to trade short timeframes - there are so many opportunities at higher TF levels with huge pip potential. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #394 ---
On the 4hr chart above, here is one entry you could take after a pin bar appears bouncing down from the resistance. Target is at the next SR major level which is 1,418 pips away. Now have a look how many short trades you could have taken on that run using pin bars, break, break and retrace, inside bars etc. Heaps - you only need 1 of these runs every month, 3 months, 6 months or year to make a huge difference to your account. This is what I try to do - get on a big run using weekly SR areas as targets, then enter multiple times on that trend. It makes a massive difference. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #395 ---
HI again - ok I'll share something that I do sometimes. Especially if I just want to do a bit of set and forget on multiple trades. Attached is a 4hr pic of the gbpjpy action as per previous post. On it I've put my modified fib - I use this purely as a measuring tool and not as a fib per se. After the first entry and target has been established, I can set limit orders all the way down at the levels shown. With this one, I can measure and say I want 10 trade entries before hitting target (T1, T2, T3 etc). I put a stop at the level above where I enter. So if I enter T3, I put a stop at T2. When price gets to T4, I move the stop for T3 to breakeven plus a couple of pips, i.e. T3 entry + 3 pips. I'll do that for every trade I enter. You can see price retraced halfway down and took out the SL of T7. T6 was also hit but SL for that one is already at BE. Same for T5. Then I wait - if price resumes it's downward trend (which it does in this case), I enter at those points again - now T8 and T9. Same thing happens again around T12. Eventually all get cashed out at the target. So how many pips do I get? (I'll count a BE trade as 0 pips in this case): T1 = 1,412 T2 = 1,274 T3 = 1,126 T4 = 985 T5 = 0 T6 = 0 T7 = -140 T8 = 709 T9 = 558 T10 = 427 T11 = 280 T12 = -140 T13 = 140 That makes a grand total of 6,631 pips on a pip run (Resistance down to support) of about 1,500 pips. Work out $ per pip and see what the potential is. Some will say - it's impossible, blah blah - I've just shown how it can be done. The other way is to use price action - retracements, pins, breaks etc. Another thing I do is move stops down for each trade thereby locking in profits. That's great and I do that a lot. However, you wouldn't have got as much from this run. Remember the old saying - let your profits run? Well if you can stand just moving your stop to BE and letting them all run with a defined target at a major support level, that's the sort of pips you can get. Interesting stuff?! Cheers Pharley

Hi Pharley. I have been reading your thread for a few weeks now. Thanks for all the helpful tips. I would like to ask a couple of questions if thats ok. 1 Is it easier to see the levels using a line chart, or does this give a false reading. I have tried both and ended up a bit confused. 2 Does the heiken ashi candles give a more balanced, smoother view of the trend. hope you don't mind these questions as I seem to be going round in circles with the different advice. Kind regards Kevin

--- 帖子 #397 ---
With line chart you are missing part of the move ... as it shows you only the close price for each candle ... without the wicks movement which is also important to define more precise levels/zones.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Kevin and thanks for your questions. I suppose everybody uses different things for their own method - what works for them and what's comfortable and useful. I tend to swap between candles and OHLC bars - I find when I use the OHLC bars I can see levels better. If I want to see more clearly the price action in a single candle, I will use candles - I can spot Pins, inside bars etc more easily using candles. As for Line charts - I don't really use them at all. That's because I want to see the full range of a candle or OHLC bar and the lines don't show that. But I'm sure there are trading methods out there that utilise the lines. HA bars - yes these do smooth out some PA as they're calculated differently. I've had these on my charts some times ago, but I find I still want to see OHLC or candles. It's because I want to see a particular SR area or line. Again, they can be useful for certain trading methods. What I hear from your question is this (and please forgive me if I'm wrong!) - I think you're trying different methods, reading advice about which is the best way, trying different things. That's fine and it's something we all do. However it can lead in to trying one method then swapping to another as soon as it loses, and on and on. My advice to you would be to do this - don't listen to others and minimise reading lots of different methods. It's so confusing! Find and choose a method that looks promising and initially use the basic candles. See what you can see. Try the OHLC bars on it if you want. It's the same information on candles as on OHLC bars after all. But pick a good method and stick to it. Do some analysis on charts using that one method. Usually the best methods (IMHO) are the price action strategies. Nice and simple charts, easy to see major and minor SR levels and things like rising or falling channels. One of the biggest things is to keep things as simple as you can. Don't fall for complicated charts with all the whistles and bells on them. Honestly they're not required. Take off everything from a chart, use candles, put it on a weekly or daily or 4hr timeframes, zoom out and draw horizontal lines where price turns. Do that for several months ago, then look at price when it gets back to it more recently. Then look at the price action when it does - is there a pin? 50% retracement? break and retrace? inside bars? Railroads? - many ways to trade this price action, and no indicators in sight! Hope that helps Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi Pharley. Thanks for your detailed explanation, and yes you are right about swapping and changing. Has it got me anywhere.? No it has'nt. one of my problems is I subscribed for around three years with a monthly subscription ( £2000 ) and this system used the 1 minute chart with line graphs. I am not saying the system did'nt work, it was simply that I was working when the markets were at their busiest. I am half way through your other thread support and resistance which is also very informative. Thanks again , and thanks for all the hard work that you do to keep this thread alive. Regards Kevin

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi Kevin and thanks, There's a great list on FF somewhere of the typical stages a trader goes through. I've read through it previously and it's pretty much spot on. At first (and for some, quite a while) it seems like 1 step forward, 2 backwards. But stick with it, find a decent method that's simple and easy to understand, learn it, trade it and stick with it. It's not just about the system itself either - it's one that fits in with your lifestyle and how much time you have. For people who are working, it's really worthwhile trading the 4 hr and daily charts because of minimal checking during the day. For those who can sit at the charts for most of the day, it's worth trading the 4hr and daily - because they cancel out market noise a lot more. 1 hr charts - sure, but sometimes I find these too much to look at and revert back to higher timeframes. Glad you're finding my other thread informative too. Let me know if you need anything. CHeers Pharley

Thanks Pharley. I have finished your support and resistance thread, it was well worth reading, for me anyway. Looking forward to moving on using your methods only. Kind regards Kevin

--- 帖子 #406 ---
HI Kevin, It's great you've read through the other thread. It's just a way of getting in multiple trades in 1 direction, following the trend, using weekly timeframes to see the big picture etc. If you can spot a good looking (potential) run coming up, plan how you're going to enter multiple times and stick with it. ENtries can be taken from a variety of things - pins, inside bars, break and retrace, breaks, etc. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thanks Pharley. I will let the dust settle a bit with the brexit news and have a go. I'll try and post a chart or two of what I'm thinking if thats ok. Regards kev

back in 2008/2009 when i was a fresh noob in forex i met a guy complaining about a broker on some forum. the broker didn't want to let him withdraw his profit. we realized why after he showed us his account statement. he turned $100 into slightly over 100k in 9 days ! as you may guess everyone in the forum couldn't believe their eyes, we literally begged him to show us his holy grail but he never did. but after some stalking, i found out that the guy open multiple small accounts with many broker at once, and trade like a madman he used compounding, something like that http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=444377 . he get between 25% and 100% roi in each trade. he doesn't care about blowing up his accounts because he only need one successful one to cover the losses by a large margin. i kept working for days trying to reverse engineer his system, i found that all his entry points were based on S/R, and that he had very little to no DD. i tried to emulate his strategy and end up blowing half of my account, like i said i was a newbie back then. i'm pretty sure that S/R are part of the solution, but not alone.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
volume + Price action + Context alongwith SR will give almost 95% result to you.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
don't know what you're trading, but there is no volume on forex.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
SR works..but I would say wait for the fakeout first..Seems like big money always fakesout levels before going for the real move.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
For me, candles size is volume, It indicates institutional interest. If you are having bigger bearish candles(during a move) on chart then better to go short on resistance levels. and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Yes there is no volume in forex. Sorry, I don't agree my brother. The pic is my last week traded levels. Below 1.005 , the upward volume disappeared and the downward volume started appearing. It's a clear message, Look for shorts. Institutes are short. As the moves go on, Bearish candles getting bigger and bigger and bullish candles getting smaller and smaller. Enough evidence to go short on appropriate levels.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
one more example, definitely candle sizes indicates institutional interest for taking price somewhere. The read line was strong daily support. How it was broken? The support getting soften and soften with increasing bearish volume and decreasing bullish volume and finally broken when price attacked it from an establish daily resistance with a greater continuous volume.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Wouldn't it be smart to turn $100 into $1000, take out $500 open account with another broker? Turn both $500 into, $5000 each, take out $2500 each, open a $5000 account. Turn $5000 into $50000 and take out $25,000 and so on???

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi all, Long time no write. I hope people have been looking at SR levels, waiting for a decent candle (pin, 2-bar reversal etc) and getting in with some wins. Remember - keep it simple. Cheers Pharley

Hi Pharley, Thanks for this system. Because of this entry technique i caught a lot of pips on the giant GU drop on Oct 6th. I think using any other technique i would have missed it. This is the easiest way to find S/R!

Hi - here are some flip trades on the GJ for the last week on the 1 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Here is one of the days with target shown

--- 帖子 #434 ---
For flip trades I'm looking to take trades on weekly, daily, 4 hr and 1 hr charts. There are heaps of them on 1 hour charts. The moving average is just an indicator to me to see if price is rising or falling - it's a SMA50. Try looking on EURAUD, AUDUSD, GBPAUD, GBPUSD as well. Heaps of them. Perhaps try to get 3 or 4 per week although there are loads more. I'm looking for a candle that is going with the trend, then a next candle or two that doesn't finish any higher (if long). Now we have a small resistance. Wait for a candle to finish above that area and place a trade back at that area - most time, price will come back to the resistance turned support area. Target is a logical previous swing high or most often, just before the high of the candle that broke through. Quite often its 30 to 50 pips. Repeat several time per week. Variation? Wait until price has come back to the S/R and place order 10 pips away on the direction of the trend. Stops at last swing low or an amount of pips - either way manage the risk.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Here's a few on GBPAUD 1hr

--- 帖子 #436 ---
A few on USDJPY 4 hr. Once you start spotting these, you'll see 1) how well they work, 2) how often they happen

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Here's a daily chart of USDJPY and the same time on the 1 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
And just for fun a few on the 15min UJ chart

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I often look at these types of trades across multiple pairs and ask myself, does it need to be any harder than that? Remember to keep things as simple as you can. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Very good approach

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Pharley. Thanks for your graphs with explanations. In your GBP/AUD (1hr graph) It shows the first trade as a sell trade. I can see how you got your minor support, but a bit confused with the sma 50 being in a steep upwards slope, and price is above it. The second trade also a sell I think I understand it as price at minor support, price below the sma 50 and sloping down, price breaks through support and sell on the retest. not sure about the third trade which is a buy. price is below the sma and pointing down, the bar before the buy trade opened below, but closed above minor support. Was the buy trade taken at the bottom of the bar where the arrow is or was a buy placed above the support line as the bar opened above support but closed below ? The fourth, fifth, and sixth trades are all buy. The sma 50 is pointing up, price is above. The buy arrows are all under minor resistance which would be the wicks on a candle chart. Do we wait for price to move above the resistance line before placing a buy or a pending order? Seventh and eighth trade both buy trades with the sma 50 pointing up and price above, also resistance has turned to support. Would you buy just above the price where the seventh buy trade opened or where the arrow shows ? Same question for the eighth bar but this one opened higher than the seventh buy trade and lower than the previous bar. The ninth trade opened just above minor resistance would we buy this there or give it time to see if minor resistance turns to support. Sorry about all the questions, I don't know how to post charts yet but I will have a go later. Regards Kevin

--- 帖子 #442 ---
How do you define FLIP TRADES?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hi Kevin and thanks for your questions. I also look at Daily and weekly charts and if you look at that timeframe with a 50SMA it shows a different picture to the 4 hr chart of course. Price had previously seen a huge drop thanks to Brexit and had bottomed out and returning upwards. On the daily chart you'll see price reacting to the 50SMA when it reached it, falling for a couple of days. It fell in to an area of support/demand. It resumed an upward trend, crossing the daily sma50 with a strong bull candle. Yes, it's better to wait until the minor S/R has been crossed and the candle closes above or below it. Then place a limit order at that area, expecting price to return to it. The arrows are only an indication of when/where to place the trade - they're not exact levels of where to buy/sell. On the 9th trade, if you look closely it closes just above the area, so I can place a limit trade at that point - the next candle dropped price and picked up the trade before going northwards again. Hope that helps a bit - I try to always look at the bigger picture first on weekly and daily charts, then move to 4 hour - sometimes even lower if I thinkI'm going to get a double bounce off minor/major S/R areas. (that's for another time I think). Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi Earlroy - flip trades are where (for example) a support has been established. Price moves back to this support area and moves through it. As we know, once support is broken it becomes resistance. Price will MANY times move back to this point of crossing - hence the flip. It's at this point you enter short or long - perhaps with confirmation. Attached is a quick screen grab of gold daily wiht a couple of flip trade areas shown. These are very powerful - heaps of them on weekly, daily, 4hr 1hr 30min 15 min 5 min charts - although I prefer the longer timeframes. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Here's 3 on a 15min GBPNZD chart, then the same pair showing one on the 1hr chart (I've left the writing in from the 15 min chart) There are tons of these everywhere and every timeframe.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Ok, also look for ranging markets. These are very tradeable - lot's of opporunities, not so much for flip trades, but off the support and resistance area. See attached and look at the pips available. Obviously good on GBPJPY, EURNZD, GBPNZD and other bigger movers, but smaller pip totals can be had. Yes this is different to straight flip trades, but this is also something I look for. For sure i try to take advantage of a trend, but where there is none (which happens a lot) I try to make the most of a ranging pair.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Some may be wondering how this relates to entering multiple times to build a large account as I discuss in my other thread. It's all related - all to do with S/R areas. The examples I show above are just a technique for entering either as a stand alone trade or for entering multiple times on a good run. As long as you can spot these levels as they occur, have patience and wait for price to break through and retrace, you can make $ just using these SR areas. I hardly use anything else except a horizontal line, so the charts are kept nice and clean and I find these levels easier to spot. Hope that helps a bit. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #448 ---

Some nice flip trade areas on GBPAUD yesterday - lots of these over the last few weeks.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I thought I'd post something that I look for when price is trending, but then retraces for a while. If you look at the pic below, you can see quite a few 1hr flip trades. But the bit I'm interested is the yellow trend line. When price retraces for a while like this in an uptrend, I draw a trend line downwards - what I'm looking for is the first candle to close above that trend line. This gives me a hint that the retrace may be over. Then I draw a horizontal line at the top of that one and wait for price to break it, retrace and enter again. The trend has returned to the upside. Looking for these things gives a chance to enter multiple times to really build the pips and $. I should point out that more often than not, price can break a falling trend line like this one, then retrace to it. I'm picking the high of that movement and waiting for the break of that and retrace.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Pharley. With the four flip trades you are showing do you stay in all the trades as they progress down, or do you come out of your first sell trade before entering your second sell trade. I have got GBP/AUD as a sell trade this morning but waiting for an entry. I'm waiting for a retrace up to 166.00 / 166.50 to sell. Does this sound OK ? Still trying to get images on to your thread, I'll try again when I get home Regards Kev

--- 帖子 #478 ---
LP Hi that trade would have got me stopped out possibly twice once above 166.00 and 166.50. I would be tempted to try and sell again at 167.50ish as the weekly trend is down and it looks to be somewhere near a 50% retrace. Or I could be totally wrong, and have a lot more to learn lol Regards Kev

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Master Pharley, what do you think with below mu current GBPJPY, still counting..where do you think it would retrace? Do i missed to put 2nd position on the 50% fib?? Where would i put my TP??

--- 帖子 #480 ---
HI there, Looks like you got a good trade in. I would have taken profit before the top of the previous swing high - see pic below. The pic shows the daily chart and where price has moved up to a previous swing high back in July. That's where I would have a target for all trades entered. We don't know what's going to happen when price gets to these levels, but for sure there will be some turbulence. So better to take the profits, especially after gaining 200+ pips and more if multiple entries were made. This is why it's important to look at the bigger picture for targets - use the weekly and daily charts to see where price can go before it hits a problem/resistance area. You'll see on the chart that the last time price was at this level, it eventually fell over 1000 pips, so I'd be out and then wait to see what happens. Cheers Pharley

You da man pharley (or something like that)! Simple and inspirational as ever.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Thanks Master Pharley, I've just take profit about 203pips last nyt.. now I see an improvement on my trading..specially enter and exits..thank you again.. I guess this really fits my trading style..

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi Kevin, Thanks for your question. Do I stay in or take profit and get out? It depends on a couple of things. First I look at the weekly and daily charts to see where the next level of support or resistance is. If there is potential to for a move of a fair amount of pips (more than 100 for example), I'll probably stay in and try to enter multiple times, especially if the move potential is several hundred pips. Important to look at weekly and daily charts and map those levels. The other influencing factor is real life - wife, kids, going somewhere etc etc. No planning some of that! If I know I have to leave trading for a while, I'll just take what I can - I'll look for a minor S/R area and take profits just before that. You don't have to go for massive pips all the time. Regular smaller amounts are just as good - as long as you base entries and targets the same way but just target a minor SR area instead of a larger one. We generally don't go broke taking profits - as long as your targets are bigger than your risk. The 2 pics below show that area on a 4hr - to show the minor support area, and a 1hr chart with 2 entries targeting that minor support. Pretty good gains from 2 trades. As I say, you don't have to get zillions of pips every time. Just one of these trades rather than 2 would be great. Not sure what happened with GA after your post - I think it went up. Anyway, keep going and I hope you get some decent pips!

Wiz! Mate! Long time or what?! THanks for your comments mate - hope you're doing well!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hey mlperlas - that's terrific! Can't complain about 200+ pips any time! Keep practising spotting these types if they fit with your trading style and what you like. There is a type/style of trading for everyone - finding it is a key thing. Some people like scalping (I'm pretty hopeless at it), some enjoy several month long swing trades. But if SR are used in any type of trading, you can normally make some decent $ and pips. Good luck with it and keep posting any feel free to post charts etc. Cheers Pharley

Hi Pharley. Sorry about my last post I was practicing. regards Kev

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi Pharley. Thanks for the reply and the graphs. Yes GBP/ AUD went up I was to eager. To be honest I am only paper trading at the moment as I have lost quite a lot of money over the years. What I based the sell trade on was that the weakly and daily are both in a downtrend, and I thought that it had reached the 50% retrace. Looking at it now the 50% retrace is I think around 1.700 so I would have tried another sell at 1.702. Now I can post graphs I'm hoping to explain my thoughts more clearly. Thanks again Regards Kev

Happy chappy today - got my levels in on GJ yesterday and took this trade. Not a perfect entry but I wasn't in front of screen when price came back to retest. Still, it worked out very well. Had a TP set before a major resistance level - check the daily chart for that level. Risk: reward was just over 1:3 which I'm ok with.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Wow...what a profit?? me also, i just take profit 203pips previous nyt, then yesterday additional 177pips.. I only trade this week with GBPJPY.. Thanks Master Pharley..learn a lot from you.. What would be your next plan for GBPJPY??

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hi mlperlas, Not sure really - it's up around an important level and that's when I sit back and watch to see what happens. Anyway, the wife wants me to get painting indoors so I reckon I'll be busy most of today! I'll have a look later when the Eurozone and UK opens to see what's happening. It's Friday, so I'm cautious, plus the USA unemployment figures are out later today and non farm employment change, plus some other red flag items. So it may be I sit on my hands and not do anything. Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hey mlperlas - those are great pips you're getting! Keep it up! Be selective ad only go for the real good looking trades. You only need 1 of those every now and again to really make a difference!

--- 帖子 #493 ---
that was my worst mistake waiting until the price recover back the original price for at least finish even

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Seems like everyone's waiting on pound or USD news. Currently in a couple of trades that haven't gone anywhere in a day or so, bouncing around breakeven.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi all - a nice little trade overnight on the GJ. News helps sometimes! This one I took off a 4 hr pin bar at channel support. Looks like it will go higher but I'm out of it as I have something else to do today and I don't want to mess around with it.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi all, Someone has asked me about 50% entries. Below I post a pic which shows both a couple of 50% entries and ordinary break and retrace trades. For the 50% entries I'm looking for price to retrace to that point, i.e. 50% and place a pending order there. It works on trending pairs (same as everything else) and it's worth having a look at it. It's surprising how many times price will retrace to 50% of the move before continuing on its way. 50% retraces work on most timeframes. Draw a fib (mine are modified) from the bottom of a move (if the trend is upwards) to the top. Then you can see the 50% level easily and place a limit trade. T1 and T2 are ordinary break and retrace trades and T2 and T4 are 50% entries.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Alrighty, got in on GBP/USD on a 50% retrace on the hourly. Targeting 1.2000ish, looking to add a position and move this one to break even on a close lower than the last low on 4hr. EDIT: 2nd entry, closed below the last low on 4hr.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
And now I'm entering EUR/AUD, on the 4 hr pinbar targeting 1.46ish. aiming to add on the way.

Thank you very much ramzam for your great Christmas wishes. May the Lord God bless us all. - Having found Pharley and this excellent thread is already a great blessing for us prospective forex traders. His S/R methods described in his two threads are rather straightforward, and work well in a trending market. - Pharley, I'd like to thank You for all your hard work you've put in this year. Your inputs are greatly appreciated. You've opened a new horizon for us. The simplicity of your methods give us a real potential so that almost anyone may become a part or full time forex trader. Thanks again. God bless.

Hey guys! I am new to this forum but I have read this thread and I just love it. I know this is might not be the right tread for this question but please bare with me, when you have a trade open for several days you have to pay for it or you make more money depending which currency have higher interest. I have tried to understand how much it costs but my broker didn't really get thru to me. Lets say I choose to go short and I take a position with 1$ /pip with a pair where I have to pay interest, How much does it cost per day?? I hope I make sense Best regards Peter

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hello Ramzam, compliments of the season. please i need your help with an indicator that help change the candlestick color (e.g. Green) when the MACD crosses the signal line upward and also change the candlestick color to (e.g. red) when the MACD crosses the signal line downward. the grey color is when the MACD line is in conflict with the histogram. SEE THE ATTACHED SCREEN SHOT: I COUNT ON YOUR SWIFT RESPONSE, GOD BLESS. Regards.

nice idea .. i will try my best.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've been looking for best trending pairs on weekly, daily and 4 hour charts. My favorite is the NZDJPY pair, but I think CADJPY and AUDJPY also look promising. - I wish you all the best of luck for the next trading year.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I'm up about 10% using a risk of 2.5% on the cable in the last couple of weeks. Haven't locked the last position in yet though. Mix of 4hr and 1hr trades, all still open targeting about 1.215ish. Reckon that's pretty good for this time of year.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
My chart looks completely different from yours, is that because we are on different time zones?? I find pin bars on yours that does not show on mine for example. I know carts can diffe somewhat but I never realized they could look like this

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi PeterSWE. My broker uses New York close candles. Your broker obviously uses a different one. A New York close price feed is basically now the industry standard. Still, I cannot recommend those guys who got me out of an NZDJPY trade lately using a 38 pips spread at NY open. The mentioned trade would have yielded me over 100 pips. They've only reimbursed my initial loss when I warned them about the possible consequences an FCA investigation would mean for them. - I've set up a NZDJPY 4h sell limit order @ 81.00 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Seatec, I never set a sell order, so I missed the entry. But it seems you got it right on the highest pip Nicely played Sir!!!

--- 帖子 #509 ---
I don't know if anyone is interested in FTSE 100 but it is closing in on it's all time high. Might be good for reversals or breaks.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi Ramzam, Please any update on the said indicator? please reply. Warm regards.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks Seatac - hope everyone enjoys a good break and has a terrific 2017! I haven't traded for a bit now - I normally take a break from it during this period and get going again come the new year. Trust those SR areas - the majority work and work well. For sure there will be some losses, so keep risk to a minimum where you can. But what are we looking for? A good solid SR area then a good signal - pin bar, 2 bar reversal, 50 % retracement inside and outside bars. Not too complex - just keep it nice and simple! CHeers Pharley

Hi guys, I've been following Pharleys threads for some time, although I do not comment on it. I must say that I'm very impressed with his method of trading and have had a very nice run using it. I hope you, Pharley, is ok with the following suggestion Would there be an interest among you guys in creating a LIVE group that gets together every day, or however it suits each and every individual. A group where we point out opportunities to each other and possible pairs that are in our liking to trade Pharleys method as well as discussion and increase our understanding. We would support each other and make us better at what we are doing. We could set up a dedicated chat room which we could use for it if interested. We could also use Facebook if that is more desirable. One thing that needs to be absolutely clear that this group would ONLY be for those that follow his method as he describes it. Clear and simple. I'm based in the UK and most days I trade the Europe hours, 0700 – 1200 GMT, although I do on occasion trade other hours I can see this kind of group being active almost 24/5 as some of you are based in Asia and USA. Even though there are only 2 or 3 online at the same time it would be nice to have someone that has the same mindset and is trading by the same method sitting next to you, on the screen Let me know what you think about it. Time to make some dollars

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi Viking and thanks for your comments. Sure if you want to set up any group etc, just go for it. I'm in Asia so my availability time might not be as good as some. Could always post any ideas on here - screen shot of a potential set up/trade. It's often beneficial to have multiple sets of eyes looking across multiple pairs! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi Ramzam, Compliment of the season. i trust you are well and doing great. Please can you help point me to the right direction where i can get the said indicator. The indicator paint the price bar with the MACD readings (see attached screen shot once again)

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hi Pharley, I totally agree to the benefit of multiple sets of eyes. We could use this thread but the thinking behind my idea of doing it in a group chat is we could make sure only those who follow your great method are participating. No trolls or different ideas, as sometimes happens in open forums. It could also be done through Facebook group. And although I'm located in UK there are some that are trading Asia hours as you and I'm sure even more will do if you are posting ideas during Asia hours Cheers...

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hi Pharley, I really like your way of trading and finding levels. I suggest that we have levels to watch for different pairs on weekly basis. Can it be done? I can try to start. It would be good for learning

--- 帖子 #517 ---
This going to be interesting . Thank you for your effort. What time do you want to do the SNR Level ? Arjun

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Like in this Live Trade Level I've marked This is very profitable level to trade from with Zero Float ( Zero Drawdown) Please share your thought. Sincerely Arjun

--- 帖子 #520 ---
U look for lower lows and higher highs on daily but recently there were weekly engulfings on gj and also on cadjpy -actually it was recently testing recent extremes. anyway all im saying that for me perfect start is weekly engulfing. then wait few days for a pullback with 30 pip sl. And after a day set sl to be and close trade if it is not in profit or around zero profit at the end of the session.

I am looking at the current AUDUSD levels. WOuld like to short it but not sure on the entry point. Can someone help? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #340 ---
From my point of view AUDUSD is at very interesting place and if we get a sign of bearish move we could see some nice set-ups over the coming days/weeks. But going short at this point in time is more of a gamble of it bouncing from the resistance line (although it is very likely to do so), so I'm waiting and watching. On the other hand it could break up and give us run long USDCAD is another pair that shoot of Pin Bar last week and I'm waiting to see long USDJPY is forming Pin Bar at support level at the moment NZDUSD might be forming Bearish Engulfing bar at a great level. ...so there are definitely some interesting things going on

Hi Ramzam, please this is a kind reminder. kindly assist. God bless. Regards.

what happened with this thread? why it just died a natural death?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
My observation for what it's worth is that threads that focus on a simple, non-indicator approach tend to be short lived. People come, some learn and apply, many can't cope with the lack of indicators and leave. But IMHO some of the best threads in FF are short and overlooked. There's gold in some of those hills. It's not dead, but perhaps all that there is to say has been said - it's now over to traders to apply. Just my thoughts...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
95% of the traders want automation and they want EAs to perform the decision making for them. they rely too much on indicators (indicators which also rely on the price). that's why the 95% : 5% ratio still exist!!!

I think Pharley's threads are of great value to us, - especially the one called Support and Resistance Method. However, for immediate and greater success I think we should find a way to combine it with Timon Weller's "Secret Tip To Detecting Trend Changes As Early As Possible In Forex"- as described in his video. The combination of these two methods which are greatly compatible and complementary could easily result in unbeatable lucrative money making system for many of us. Pharley is a genius, and so is Timon Weller.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Bump. Took this with a pending order, moved to BE after 25 pips, going to let it run to 110ish area.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Its a pity my timing is a bit off......I discovered this thread after Pharley's participation ended. I, unfortunately, am still at the point where the drawing of Support and Resistance levels off higher TF charts, is a challenge. I searched and read quite a bit about it from material I found on the net. It range from the very simplistic approaches to some that are very precise and exact in their rules and application. Must say for me the most helpful was the free stuff that is posted by a guy by the name of Nick Bencin0. At the end of the day I think its more important to start drawing the levels and learn from my application and improve with experience. Rather than to try to find the best instructions/ method for drawing S&amp;R levels. I have 10 pairs which I will be monitoring and draw S&amp;R levels. I will mostly draw the levels using the Weekly chart with some fine tuning on the Daily if its needed. I will explain my thinking behind my levels with the hope that more experienced members will comment and guide me to accelerate my learning. The 10 pairs are: EURAUD, EURJPY, AUDJPY, EURNZD, EURUSD, GBPAUD, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, USDJPY One other thought I have but which I have not applied to my higher TF charts yet: Could one draw major S&amp;R levels using the same concept as what Pharley uses to draw minor S&amp;R levels? EURAUD Looking at this pair it is stuck in a range, even more so if viewed on the D1 chart, so it does not look like a good on to trade now Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURJPY Way to many levels shown on the chart. If I remember correctly Pharley said to only draw levels in the immediate vicinity of where price is now. According to my assessment. price is overall in a up trend but is pulling back this week and is nearing a support level. So its time to watch on the lower Tf's for a possible bounce and a continuation of the up trend Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDJPY This where my inexperience is showing up: This is where I drew the latest Resistance level after the previous week's close. But maybe the dark orange line is the better level? My assessment when looking at the daily and H4 charts is that the DeepSkyBlue line is the better one as we have a railway track on the D1 and a retrace back to the 50% level, which Pharley always say is a good 1st entry in a new trend. So, I think this is a missed opportunity. But also its counter trend cos the general trend is UP? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will post more pairs later when I have time. Thanks

Is this method still valid today? I read in one of the threads that not all trading methods are tradable forever.. Would like to give this method a try as its simple to apply. Thanks Lyn

--- 帖子 #349 ---
HI all - been busy and not on here for ages and ages. Hope you've found something useful on here. Hollowhead is right - when things are simple, it doesnt' need a massive thread, just simple ideas, simple diagrams. This is all about support, resistance, reversals, continuations. Nothing difficult to grasp. Again I advise you to just open a weekly and daily chart, draw in major SR areas, go to 4hr and daily charts to look for reversal candles (pins, engulfing) and continuation patterns like inside bars. Either take a single trade or if it look like a swing is going to last a while, add to positions to really boost your account. BE a swing trader and less of a day trader. Swing traders get those nice swings and stay in trades for a day or a few days - adding to positions as they go. HUGE boosts to account are possible. Less stress, less trades, less fee's, more accurate entries, more successful trades, bigger profits. That's how I look at it. My most important advice is to get your levels right - SR levels that is. They're so important I can't emphasise them enough. That's the bread and butter and where you're going to get the majority of your trades from. Risk mgt/money mgt - get that right and don't risk too much. Boring I know, but if you lose all you trading money in a few trades, what are you going to do for the rest of the month? Stay in the game. Add to your pot when you can. Trade small if you don't know how to yet and don't worry about the $ you make or lose. Learn how to trade first. So what if you win or lose $5? You want to learn how to win, how to trade, how to manage your money, how to look for class A trades. When you've done that, you can go bigger. When they say don't put so much at risk that you can't sleep it means this - if you left a trade on overnight and you went to sleep and you lose $5, does that bother you? If it does, you're in the wrong game. If it doesn't, then that's exactly the same feeling you want with all your trades. For some that will be $50, or $500, or $1000 or whatever. If you have a small account, then for sure the risk will be small. But if you're working you can replace it. So don't sweat small losses and risks - them's the dues you pay to learn it. Major SR levels, reversal patterns, continuation patterns, risk mgt. That's it. Got get it! Cheers Pharl

Another awesome thread. A gem for traders. You making trading great again.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Wow, after an absence from FF for 2 to 3 years, it's interesting to come back for a brief time. I still see the same type of forum threads. I saw somewhere, someone had asked why this thread and my other one sort of died out. It's simple really - I'd put the strategy information up with lots of examples including a live one. Not much more to say. Hope you're all doing well and being sensible with trading. Remember - trading is hard. Don't make it harder with an overly complicated system. Make it as simple as you can. Candles, horizontal lines, daily charts, support and resistance, risk management, flip trades, pin bars, inside bars. Don't need much else. Good luck all.
