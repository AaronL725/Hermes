Hello,

I want to trade for a living. I can only do this if I can consistently take 10 pips a day for 1year compounding of course. My projections with 10 pips a day starting with $100 for 1year gives me $40,000. This can only happen if i can confidently take 10 pips a day.

Now, I will need the help of all of you. I use xixi's TZ indicator for this purpopse. All credit to him and all the others who contributed to the similarity thread. I only trade in the direction of the middle TZ forming. I use the 1hr TF, but the same principle can be applied to any timeframe.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
The middle TZs as shown on the picture above only identifies high momentum opportunities. I am only intrested in how the middle TZs are formed. This principle can be applied to any market.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
wish u the best

I do not know much about indicator you use now.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Albert wish you good luck! I have the same goal to earn consistent 10 pip a day. I will follow your thread with interest. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
10 Pips a day consistently is achievable provided you are disciplined enough. That's the toughest part. 10 pips gain few days in a row, inadvertently makes one to push luck or skill until that one big mistake sets you back to square one.

If you can manage to be disciplined to stay away from the charts after you make your 10 pips, then you might have something by the end of a year.

P.S: Suggest you try using Renko charts. Price action is more clear and with the brick size set to 10P you could probably focus on achieving this better.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I Albert

can you explain to me how you trade  with this indicator?

you go long when...

you go short when...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This is to illustrate how i trade.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Now the candle 1 just closed. it was a momentum candle. The middle TZ fomed is occupying empty space, meaning price on the right side has not been there yet. As soon as this happens you take your position and in this case a sell. I only target 10 pips and almost surely it take my profit. So I only trade when a middle TZ occurs.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
So you wait for price to pass the middle forming TZ by 10 pips before entering back towards it trading into the potential recurrent prices? So you are looking into trading just one of these per day? SO what is your plan of action if the forming TZ or the recurring area above is not returned to in a strong move? Stop loss??

The transient zone basic thread is getting some energy today. Maybe this topic will pick up steam once more...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Ok, I see

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I did not trade this. Am done for the day.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
So whats your plan when price decides not to act right?

You see the m TZ forming with momentum. You enter and price takes you for a spin in the wrong direction. Are you 1:1 with stop loss or what?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Well Bill, Money management is a very tricky thing. I can't say use 1:1 or a fixed stoploss or the last swing high or low. The TZ's may present as turning points in themselves.

I will exit the trade with a reversal M TZ thats for sure. Meaning an oposite entry signals I should be out of the trade.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Good morning

This is my second entry for the day.

Lets see how it ends.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Your indicators do not show up on screen even though they do show up on the indicator list after applying it to the chart.  Does a setting need to be changed for it to show?  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Can you point out he first entry and result?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Bill, you will have to plot it on your chart. H is 6 for the Left and Right. You will see that the MTZ formed on the breakthrough candle but was later cleared by one of the remaining H 6.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Ok, I see it.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Closed trade for a loss of -23 pips.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
If this current candle closes as it is, a MTZ is very likely to form and my entry for a buy will be on the close of the candle

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Am in. Entered Buy. Lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Entered buy for 10 pips

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks Albertdpllh. just wondering is it possible to create email and popup alert when we get a valid signal?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
No please. I have no coding skills.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #25 ---
My EJ closed +10 pips, and provided another opportunity. Did not take it. Just realised my GJ also just closed +10 pips. Done for the day.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Another opportunity gone

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Beautiful day. Lots of opportunities for this pair today, however I trade in only one direction once.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Where can I read the discription of the indicator?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh

Is this indicator repainting?
Because this morning I (demo)trade NzdCad. After closing the candle got valid signal I took the trade then after 2 candles I can’t the valid signal gone and new signal plot top of the 3rd candle.
I don’t have screen shot. Next time I will take a scree shot.

If you don’t mind shear your template.

You will get a better understanding of the indicator here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=509195

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Tricky question. I'm going to try answer this question. The indicator helps expose areas of great importance and interest. It is used in different ways by different people. It attempts to mark out zones that price has not visited for a certain number of bars(H) for the left and right of the breakout bar, after which we say the zone is transient or recurrent.

The pdf above throws some light on the concept. Now i try to use that to my advantage.

You will observe that the TZ indi marks the highs and lows of price that actually become turning points provided the zone becomes transient.

Now taking H to be 6 (I use 6 because it gives me many entry opportunities but more risky, a bigger H makes it more stable), When a zone appears e.g for a low, it means the bar at the center is trying to be the lowest low and if for the next future 6 bars none goes lower than the zone, it becomes transient very often a turning point for price.

Now if any of the future 6 price goes lower than the bar of interest that price will become the new bar of interest, of course it will clear the initial zone and form a new one, and this will keep happening until it becomes transient. Not the same as repainting.

So to answer your question about repainting, No it does not repaint because price does not repaint relative to time. If the zone disappears it only means the area is recurrent. All this stuff you will find here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=509195

But i am only interested in the middle TZs.

I will explain how to pick them out in real time soon. Better still let me know when you have a potential setup on one of the pairs that you will want me to monitor with you.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
To be clear your interest is in middle potential transient zones PTZs  right?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Albert Simple and easy system,

Trying to understand system took 10 pips on GBPNZD just want to ask is this a correct entry.

thanks

regards

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Good morning, my 1st trade for the day

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thank you for sharing. Did you change the settings of the indicator ?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Good morning Albertdkpllh,

Thank you for sharing this simple and nice trading system.

I trade off the M15 timeframe, what setting can you recommend for H (as you used 6 for H1 timeframe).

Thanking you in advance.

Try 18 for H

--- 帖子 #40 ---
took me out at -28 pips. Took another entry opportunity but with a H = 8, to filter more of the weak trades.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
+ 20 pips

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Entered.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
What do you mean by middle zone? How do you know when a zone appears it wil be a middle zone?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Me too, eurjpy +20pips.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh and all the old timers of similarity,

So we start again from scratch, don`t we? If you exit on a reversal MTZ that could be 50 or even 100 pips. So if you will be profitable with this method that would be thanks to discretion and money management not because of the method or transient zones itself.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Daily Target reached with another shot at eurusd for +20pips total +40pips.

thank you Albertdkpllh for sharing.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thank you for your respond, but don't you think that I will miss a lot of trading opportunities, because I trade off of M15 timeframe, but I'm testing 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 to see the best that will give valid setup. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Fxrabbi,

I noticed that you trade the 15min TF with an H of 6. You will have more stable opportunities if your H was bigger, sey, 18.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi Kore2, I will attempt explaining my trade management. Lets bare in mind that this style of trading aims at securing my 10 pips at all cost.

1. The picture explains one method of managing your loss.

2. I was using H=6, I have adjusted H to 8 for more convincing entries.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Referring to this picture for my management of trades. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
"I will explain how to pick them out in real time soon. Better still let me know when you have a potential setup on one of the pairs that you will want me to monitor with you".

We are still looking forward to your promise to explain how to pick potential setup.

Thanking you in advance.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Potential setup for a sell. My H is 8.    12min to the close of the candle.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Now if the candle closes below the line we will have MTZ formed and i will sell there. However if the candle close above the line then it will be a regular TZ.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
MTZ formed.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
My today's trades up to now. Not bad.

I use a Trade Manager with SL = TP = 20 pips, after 10 pips profit BE, then TS 10 pips.

see you on monday.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thank you...

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Very clear now...hope to hear more from you. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Fxrabbi,

If you don't mind could you please share your template and indicator.

thanks

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Done. +10 pips.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Pls, kindly pm me, I like to keep this thread clean for Albertdkpllh to manage as a sign of respect for him. Thank you for your understanding.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh.

I want to ask you something, what % do you take from one transaction?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
5% per transaction.

That is for now may change in future.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Tnx i guessed that 5%

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Do you watch the news? Because it seems like there are many MiddleTZs forming after news releases.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Albert,

Do I get it right that your trigger for entry is a)waiting for a MTZ (brown zone) to appear and b) enter on the open of the next candle?

Thanks.

P.S. (I am reading other threads on TZs but since they are rather lengthy I am asking this question by way of taking a "shortcut" as I feel something important still escapes me in the method).

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hello Albert, is there an indicator that also shows the failed middle tz  ? I'd like to see how often they occur. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Are you using an EA for that trade manager? I'm doing something similar manually, but it would be great if I could have an EA for that

--- 帖子 #69 ---
No I don't watch the news. Its happening on the chart and i think 1hr candles is enough time to absorb the effects of the news

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I don't know about that.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Looks promising, suscribed.

Thanks for sharing.

I´m not a coder but I think an EA for this system would be easy to do, any interested coder here?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Albert hi! may i ask whether the MTZ will repaint or not? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi Mario, there is no issue of repainting with this indicator/Tool. It just shows where price has been and where it hasnt been. When the zone changes colour red/yellow the it means price has not been in that zone for the H number of bars. In the formation stages however the MTZ forming could fail.

I am interested in the first bar forming the zone. That is where i take my opportunities

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
If the zones become h-transient they will leave a red and yellow box that will not repaint. zones that are not yet h-transient will have a light brown color box that will vanish if the box becomes h- recurrent (price returned to the zone before +h bars.)

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh

I want to ask one more question, if you make first transaction -23 pips in one of day what you will do ? Will you do more transaction for make 10 pips in profit?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Albert! What's parameters of MA you use on yours screens? thanks beforehand.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi, Fortunately I had more opportunities in other markets. I closed the day +30pips net.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
21 EMA. I have taken it off my chart.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Good morning. Did anyone trade these.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
My first trades for the day

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I finded nothing about stop-loss, this topic. Are You the stop?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Albert What settings u r using apart from H-8, b,cuz i don't have signal on my GU chart.

thanks

regards

--- 帖子 #84 ---
No other settings. Just H=8. You will notice that the current candle went down enough to clear the zone.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Yes I use a stop loss. I set mine to the low or high of the latest 8 candles

--- 帖子 #86 ---
EJ +10 Done for the day

--- 帖子 #87 ---
EJ +10. waiting for GU

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Isn't every incomplete zone brown? If so, the zone can be both recurrent as well as transient. And if that is so couldn't you just go long as well as short?

But I'm missing something here. Could you you please explain what it is that I'm missing? (And don't say intelligence because that's apparent.)

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Zone can only be incomplete (PTZ), h-transient or h-recurrent(h-zone will disappear)

--- 帖子 #90 ---
+10 from GU

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hmmm as much as possible i want to avoid the use of the words Transient and Recurrent.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Now lets take a look at this pair. I can tell that an MTZ will be formed or not even without the indicator. Assuming the current candle closes well above the line a MTZ will be formed. Thats when i take the buy trade and manage it. The line here is drawn above the high of the latest H (8) candles.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Since it's more probable that the "MTZ" will be cleared than becoming a true TZ, would it not be a better choice to trade back towards the forming zone if a candle closes above/below?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
This looks pretty good thread. Thanks to OP for sharing this. I think I will start backtesting anytime soon. Good luck to you all. I'm gonna backtest in 4h chart and with 1% risk and 3:1 RR

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I know my daily target is 10 pips but i can't see such sweet entries and pretend to be blind.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
One sure trick i look out for is the size of the MTZ formed.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Meaning the wider the MTZ is, the better are the chances the move will continue?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
wouldn't it be more logical to place your stop right behind the zone? Because if price goes there the zone will disappear and wouldn't that mean the window for the trade is closed?

--- 帖子 #99 ---

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Noted

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Give us the size or shape for better understanding, thank you.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Another +10 pips from both EJ &GU. should be done for the day.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Just took this one, lets see how it goes

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Target reached. This is where greed sets in. I hope am actuall done for the day

--- 帖子 #105 ---
The MTZ forming jsut point the direction to which i should trade. The MTZ forming could fail because price could have cleared the zone before it remained permanent. you will definately get a reversal if price went above/below the high/low of the last 8 candles. thats where i will place my stop loss.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi fxrabbi, I like to see a big candle creating a big MTZ, say, 15 pips or more

--- 帖子 #107 ---
The risk:reward setting of that setup is hard to sustain. One loser could wipe 5 or more winners...

That's like trading transient & recurrent zone 97% vs 3% (no SL but 97%+ win rate).

I'm wondering how long have you been trading this concept?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
All credit to Basch312, Kprsa and others for the development of the indi. Am adding this indi to to help see the levels for my stop loss. Your stop loss goes on the channel.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
hey albert,

thx for sharing this way of trading!

I have one simple question. How "big" is your drawdown/pullback in pips aprox. on every trade to get your 10 pips win?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Approxmately 12 with spread. But you have seen me close some losing trades.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I see a potential set up. Depends where it close

--- 帖子 #113 ---
so just to get this one right:

if the price closes above the channel, a MTZ is forming and your are buying into the opening of the next H1 candle with a TP of 10 pips and a SL at the bottom of the channel?!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Yep, then again i hope the zone will be high enough

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Am not trading it though, am done for the day

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I should have taken this last trade for the day. Anyway, I hope you see this would have hit my target real quick.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I have a question.  How do you scan for these?  Do you check specific currencies every hour?  Do you have an alert?  I am trying to follow along but how simple it is, is there a way you can anticipate an entry tz therefore put it in a "watchlist" for closer observation.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
yep thanks, it's clear now.

I am also interested in this what singha asked.

And how many pairs do you watch ?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I have about six markets opened. I check 5min to every hour for a porential break out like this.

Wooow you remember this chart

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Potential MTZ in the making. it bean entry opportunity only when it closes above the line. The further away it is closes from the line the higher the potential MTZ will be the better my chances of taking 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
NO trade, right?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Its a good trade. Perfect entry, the type i look for. The zone has a height of about 18 pips. Then you manage it the best possible way.

. I see its struggling though.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
last for the day

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Do you mind giving your settings for the %B channel?  The one provided on the template doesn't match up to your charts.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thank you! I have not traded yet with your strategy but I have been paying attention to this thread and will give it a shot in a day or two. I actually been taking "mental trades" and I think U/J fits the criteria right now. Seeing how it goes.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Sorry pal but over a 5:1 risk:reward will set you back severely sooner or later. A single loss wipes 5 (or more) days of trading. Some of your other screenshots I've seen have an even worse risk to reward. If your strategy is working, why not tweak it to get more out of the trade to even your risk/reward up.

As it stands, not only will a few losses in a row damage the account, but it will screw with your psychology and mindset which is just as important, if not more, when trading (I know I'd be all over the place if I just lost 2 trades in a row setting me back 10 days of trading, which is why I don't put myself in that position).

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Goodmorning

--- 帖子 #134 ---
GM! and also same situation in EurGbp.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Possible MZ in AudJpy ?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I think its better to wait for London open.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Yes, listen to brokers advice. Don't forget your tight stops!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hardly any brokers advice. Every single successful trader will tell you money management is key in trading. This includes having a positive risk to reward ratio (is it not just common sense?).

Anusragger, unfortunately if something so simple as to have a positive risk to reward (AKA sound MONEY MANAGEMENT) is beyond your comprehension, then you'll continue taking one step forward and two steps backwards and eventually blow your account (more like inevitably blow your account).

You'd have to win almost 84% of the time to just to get over the breakeven mark (and that's only at 5:1 R:R). If it were that easy picking 10 pips with a stop of 50+ (with absolutely no losing streaks) then we'd all be laughing our way to the bank.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Psychology is key. MM is very important. R:R is a BS myth which 95% (according brokers) of traders use. R:R on itself doesn't mean anything does it.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
R:R ties in with your edge in trading, along with your psychology and everything else that matters in achieving to trade successfully. I never said that R:R on its on was the the end all be all of the matter.

What I did say was having a R:R of 5:1 (or worse) is a bad idea to begin with. Like I mentioned before, if OP has a tried and working strategy, there shouldn't be any reason why it can't be tweaked to yield a positive risk reward. Not doing so will cause major set backs (or blow the account). With any successful strategy still comes losses, and when those losses are FAR greater then your reward you're not going to get anywhere. One step forward two steps backwards. Don't know a better way to put it. I'm unsure why you're trying to argue otherwise?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Okay, I agree with you.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
It's a matter of time when you get those days where all setups fail, 3-4 losses in a row. Now imagine how you feel after those 3-4 losses with 5:1 RR. Now pulling the trigger is damn hard when you see that you need 20 winning trades to make that up...

This strategy could work, by tweaking the risk reward ratio. Eventually you will end up with 65%-70% win rate on 1:1 RR at best. That's what my experiments with the TZ concept showed me... But maybe you can do better, I could be wrong.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
If this closes this high, it increases my chances for a sure 10 pips.

Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #144 ---

Mine as well so far.

A strong sentiment indy may filter strings of losing trades.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I know that, but see the results. I think it works, because my wins are most only some pips (risk 5%). I'll try it still for a while.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
EJ done. waiting for GU.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
gbpusd too will come down, its only doing a little pullback.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I think as time goes on we will collectively agree on MM, R:R and the psychology of our trades. I agree that systems will fail, infact i failed here twice and am in GU that seems to be dangling for now, but i will manage it to the end.

With time you will realise some tricks about this system for yourselves. e.g. the hight of the potential zone being created must be considered.

I hinted that the bigger the high of the zone the better your chances of  taking 10 pips.

Am sorry that unfortunately the further away my stop loss is from my initial entry the better my chances of securing 10 pips.

Lets test the system. Move your stop loss with the channel accordingly till we are skilled with choosing our trades, for instance I go for markets with a good daily range like the Pound pairs, Yen pairs etc. Lets keep testing and see whats best.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
No doubt, this system is very good and simple, but trading H1 timeframe can not give me my tested MM, which is RR 1:2(SL@10pips and TP@20pips) even when I have 3 loss and 2 winners (10pips *3 =30pips and 20pips *2winners =40pips, therfore 40pips - 30pips =10pips for the day) and I believe this system can give a better win rate. That is why I trade off M15 timeframe for a better stop loss placing and with a better understanding of PA. Thank you, that's my little contribution.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I make NO interference post trigger - stop or target; its a do or die thing for me in this department....the trick is, it allows me to be PATIENCE.

" Am sorry that unfortunately the further away my stop loss is from my initial entry the better my chances of securing 10 pips. "

There's no doubt about that. But you need about 5 winners for 1 loser, and this only for BreakEven! I'm sure you'll lose in the long run, if you don't change your R:R

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I guess GU try to break the last support (From last friday) you can see within posted char.

BTW, I am sure GU will go down. You may have green pips with higher stoploss.

Let's see what happen .

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I'm sorry about that one, that's part of the business, is the cost of doing business. Look for reasons NOT to take all the MTZ's , if you cannot find one, you have found a low risk entry.... and you only need 2 of those per day...

....stack all the reasons to take a MTZ's in your favor and many things nice begin to happen.

*PA

*S+R

*DPP

*BRN

*move to lower TF for better SL placement

*good MM

*etc, etc....

Cheers.

Am trying to figure out my MM....especially for the H1 TF. Any ideas.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I have be expecting to hear from you since, MM is the key...best wishes

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Try with constant dollar risk for each setup. Depending on SL distance calculate your position size, so that each setup have the same weight regardless of time frame. And as already said by others using a risk reward of 10:1 or 5:1 is suicide... At least 2:1... Better 1.5:1 risk reward (yes risk still bigger than reward). Give it a try. The win rate will go down but who cares about a win rate of 90% when 1 losers kills 9 profitable trades?...

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I don't know how you want to go about it, but for me, my TP has to be greater than my SL (TP>SL)

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Yeah. This makes sense.

I am agree my friend. I think this is dangerous enough.  I traded like this before, but i got my entry at the second/third candle (after it has retraced, and made the Mid Zone smaller). My SL is some pips outside the other side of the zone. Lets say the big bear candle is forming, the mid TZ is forming (big enough), then i wait for the next/second next candle, hope it will retrace. If it retrace, and the mid zone will become smaller, then i do a sell .... my SL is some pips above the upper side of forming mid TZ. But as you said, without SL (even with good MM) , this is still dangerous.  May be i need another filter ....

Thank you for this great information, added to what you observed, take this:

I did some discovery on how to know which one will retrace back or which one will go straight to your TP. Look at the candle that pass through the mid TZ, You will be able to use it to determine your entry point and SL point.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
You can say that again, Sir

--- 帖子 #228 ---
This type will not retrace, you can but your SL at the back of the mid TZ, for better or tight SL (5-10pips). I will show the one that will likely to retrace so that you wait for the pullback before your entry for a better SL.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Usually the first MTZ yeah......

Hi can help me see my entry? I having SL, is that i go in wrong entry?

This type will likely retrace, wait after the correction, to find your entry for a better or tight SL(5-10pips).

NB: (look far left of the chart).

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Yes, Boss, but importantly the way it cross, let say whether down, up, half of the TZ . I'm only trying to guide us on how to place a tight SL, the entry is as you put it in your post1.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
You need to wait for the candle that cross the mid TZ  to closed at the top or bottow of the TZ, before you place your order. Maybe Albertdkpllh will have a better view.

Cheers.

EU +10

In this trade there was MTZ formed which is now taken off by price action in this trade my TP is 10 pips and SL is 20 pips which is for safety  actuly i use mental SL watch price action. After entry price went against my entry but  i was expecting price to come round no then if it bounce from it, it will go up so i was watching it it did the same bounced from RN made inside pinbar on next bar it hit the TP.

Weldone Trading around the red news hour?.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hello Albert,

Your method looks good and I think if you change a little bit on your R:R, then you will be more profitable. When you take a trade, you should set your SL at the end of PTZ candle which means as soon as the PTZ is invalidated, you are out. You don't have to wait until price retraces to the end of your H candles. If the price didn't move your way before the last H candle, then also you can come out of the trade. Also, try to trail the stop with 10 pips so that you could earn more pips per trade. I am talking about 1 Hour time frame. Just sharing my thoughts, my friend

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thank you Tradeforlife. I'll simulate that and see how it goes.

Good morning. Just taken trades, lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
No its not an MA, its the kijen sen, and the %B works but not good for placing my stop loss. The only change to the rule is to trade with the trend. I don't take signals against the trend. This thread is about the Potential MTZ opportunities, and we want the best entries. Its okay to use any system or indicators that keep you with the trend so that you take your entries with the trend when the potential MTZ is forming.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
This is a great idea my friend. Thanks. Will try to look at mid-TZ candle behavior. I am not so sure that the first one will not retrace , but may be this is depend on the 'h' value we are choosing .....

Edit: comparing both images, i think i got your point.    Thanks

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Good to know that a compatriot is here. I really like the fixed R:R of 1:2 and it keeps you ahead often even if loss trades morethan wining trades.

looking forward to your more of your entries

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Albert,

I just scanned the 15 min charts and saw there were a lot of chances today during the asian session. especially the EUR pairs.

I think you could try using the correlation here as well. If there is a chance in one of the EUR pair, then check for other EUR pairs as well.

Also one more tip. When you take a trade once MPTZ happens and if that PTZ candle is a long one, then better wait for a few minutes of next candle (15 min) so that you can catch that retrace as well as there is always a small retrace after a big candle.

I would say, don't settle for a fixed TP. once the trade is in profit of more than 15 or 20 pips then set the trail stop to 10 pips. In that way, you could catch more pips.

Happy green pips today.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I absolutely agree with you. I thought I could get myself to take just 10 pips a day. Now i find myself taking more than that. I have started trailing my trades.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
You're welcome, let kill it together.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yes, we are here to work together, that R:R makes me comfortable even when I have a bad day. I like to see yours charts too and learn one or two things from you.

Good morning friends. Hope all is well with you. Just looking at this.

Now this weekend was very hectic for me. I tried to strike a good balance for R:R other ways of trading this indi came up which were very very profitable but managing my R:R was still an issue. I believe its the psycholgical part thats drawing me back. For the sake of this thread i will dwell on what we have already started here. lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
For this trade and others that i will take, I set a fixed stop of 30 pips. I stay and trail the trade so long as price remains above the kijen sen. I target at least 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
GJ +10 Now this trade is interesting from the SL point of view when i entered in this trade price came back as u can see my SL was below RN but that is just for emergency i was watching the price action if the GJ close below the 179.00 i will close this trade and take the loss but as u can see it didn't close below the 179.00 and pin bar also add my confidence that it will go up. Price action did the same.

Did anybody notice previous Zones act as Supply and Demand also.

Regards

Today total +15

--- 帖子 #277 ---
You trade only when the price breakout  from the MTZ or you trade reverse also?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I trade only when the potential MTZ forms.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
May you share your Tz setting so I can test as well?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I tried to do a trade and I got confused with this system.  Hopefully you folks can explain.

There was a MTZ forming and I was thinking once a new candle shows up above it, I was ready to open a long but the zone completely disappeared.

There was another instance where the zone disappeared but only to show up again when the following candle bouncr d away from it (support).

So I just want to ask for a clarification of how exactly are we suppose to enter a trade, how to handle the two situations above and why did they appear/disappear?

Much thanks!

I like this approach, but...

despite the fancy TZ indicators, this strategy is nothing more then really simply buying the cross-close over the Donchian channel bands.

I see some logic here... in realy old Donchian theory the buy signal is created when the price action breaks through and closes above the upper band and vice versa.

Really basic system, which is known for dozens of years (maybe from 50ties) and not tradable in the long run.

I think more sophisticated filter will be needed to survive.

He is right to an extent. Others use the TZ tool completely differently, which ever way you it is used must be based on the probabilities associated with the TZs. The probality that the MTZ will be revisited by price is a lot higher than otherwise. I chose the opposite because I realized the tendency for price to continue in the its original path was much greater than it turning around once it started creating an MTZ. U really don't need a strong filter like he said to succeed with this method. You need good money management. Anyway add the this indi to any trading system and tell me if you can't trade it successfully with good MM.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
what other system do i need or filters for this ? like EMA for trend ?

What is good money management risking  small like 2 percent  pertrade and a stop of 10 and a target for 20 for example ?

Best regards

--- 帖子 #315 ---
well we could agree that TZ zone is ploted every time the candle closes over the donchian band, where TZ h=donchian lenght.

just plot donchian channel with lenght 8 over the chart with TZ with h=8

signals are equal

this way you can make quick visual backtesting as much in history as much you want - buy every time the candle closes over the up band and vice versa

with forwardtesting the H1 or 15min timeframe, you would need many months to say if this method is tradable in the long run or not, 10 days is realy not enough,

with donchian channel you can make your own judgment in couple of minutes or hours... and as I see.. if we would take everysingle signal we would end up in loss, no matter how the MM will be set up

anyway i agree that according to the donchian theory the Alberts approach is more rational, then the opposite use of TZ zones (hoping that the price will come back to the zone)

Is the TZ indicator repainting/recalculating?

Because when I setup yesterdays M15 GU chart I don't see your entry signal...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Tricky question. I'm going to try answer this question. The indicator helps expose areas of great importance and interest. It is used in different ways by different people. It attempts to mark out zones that price has not visited for a certain number of bars(H) for the left and right of the breakout bar, after which we say the zone is transient or recurrent.

The pdf above throws some light on the concept. Now i try to use that to my advantage.

You will observe that the TZ indi marks the highs and lows of price that actually become turning points provided the zone becomes transient.

Now taking H to be 6 (I use 6 because it gives me many entry opportunities but more risky, a bigger H makes it more stable), When a zone appears e.g for a low, it means the bar at the center is trying to be the lowest low and if for the next future 6 bars none goes lower than the zone, it becomes transient very often a turning point for price.

Now if any of the future 6 price goes lower than the bar of interest that price will become the new bar of interest, of course it will clear the initial zone and form a new one, and this will keep happening until it becomes transient. Not the same as repainting.

So to answer your question about repainting, No it does not repaint because price does not repaint relative to time. If the zone disappears it only means the area is recurrent. All this stuff you will find here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=509195

But i am only interested in the middle TZs.

I will explain how to pick them out in real time soon. Better still let me know when you have a potential setup on one of the pairs that you will want me to monitor with you.

Hi Albert I try to take 1:2 from every trade. I have some set of rules for entry now.

1. Trade only during EU, LO and NY open.

2. Time Frame 15 Mins.

3. Keep eye on currency strength meter Trade only High and Low currency's. like in today's trade usd and cad at high against Jpy.

4. Entry should be at 50% of the MTZ or u can say at pullback. For better MM.

5. Its better to enter at 1st MTZ.

6. Observation of charts also works.

Our strong point in forex market is our stop loss and  entry. I think this the only two thing we can control in the Forex rest is all depend on the market.

Now i am not using stop loss more than 10 pips.

MTZ give me direction for the market, I try to enter at 50% of the MTZ candle this give us better MM. IF you look at CADJPY chart posted above there are two MTZ formed today and on both  next candle  retrace almost upto 50% then price went up.

hope it helps

Looks good Late entry  trying to get 10 pips

--- 帖子 #364 ---
update on EJ hit my TP while posting above chart.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
nice!

Two more questions:

Fixed SL and TP of 10 pips?

And do you just trade weak against strong currency or also strong against middle strenght currency (e.g. eur8.0 and jpy 4.0?)

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi,

Max SL is 10 Pips or other side of the MTZ (Which ever is low)  I try to get 1:2 RR from Trade.

Its better if we use Strong Against Week Currency. like in the case of AUD CHF. I was waiting for price to retrace before going down but it didn't and went down this is best trade to get 1:2 RR if i took it bcuz my risk in this is around 4 pips and reward is 10 pips.

regards

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hello Albertdkpllh please can you enplane how to use the currency indicator that you posted

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I think this should be directed at Jeetvirk. I have very little knowledge of the currency strenght indicator.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Example of bad entry, if I entered entered at 50% of MTZ candle its easy 1:2 RR. want to kick myself

--- 帖子 #370 ---
SL hit -10

Happy trading this week to all.

Happy trading to u also.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
missed this beautiful MTZ price move 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
+17 good start for the week 1:2 RR i risked 8 pips for this one.

If we look at this chart it produce 3 MTZ all r winners.    combine this with the CSM, Best RR. I think this is pure gold. Because I am again saying in forex the things only we can Chose is our Stop loss and price at which we want to enter, apart from this we retail traders don't have control on any thing.

sorry for english.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I will not trade this. Waiting for confirmation that we can sell......

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Nicely formed MTZ.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Wooow am just seeing this in 15min. Jeetvirk could'nt have missed this.....

--- 帖子 #383 ---
This pairs spread is very high moves to fast. better is put pending order at 50% of the candle. there is a red news also for GBP so it might be GBP go into range mode.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
You right.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I try to trade the pair with the RED on top and blue below on CSM. on this the risk is more than 10 pips even at 50%, and NZD is boss during Euro session CHF is slave so best pair is NZD/CHF at that time. which give me 17 pips.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Would you mind posting your indicators and template?  Mines doesn't display the TMZ even though indicator is attached (I can't figure out why?). Thanks in advanced!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Would you be tempted to trade this, if the candle closes the way it is. You have ADX momentum on your side, daily down trend..... What do you think.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
here u go my friend

--- 帖子 #389 ---
No, because the CSM is not agree at that time, 2. RR is not good this MTZ is too near to Round no 1.0900 it is almost selling at the buying position, EJ is good option than EU.

hope it help

--- 帖子 #390 ---
AU close half position SL move to BE. MTZ on 5 mins can be traded after news also.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
UPdate AU hit 20 pips. Done for the day.

But very bad entry i should enter at 50%.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I have observed whenever there is clear cut move during the news, with the help of 5min or 15 min MTZ and CSM we can easily make good pips but stop loss should be in mind for emergency we can put SL of 20 or 25 pips. Looks what happens on usdcad yesterday after usd news.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
This not MTZ trade but looks good

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Missed this one while writing post  what a beautiful 61.8% pullback entry.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Now this EU signal of MTZ on 15 min is not safe to trade because of the Wick of 15 min candle. look at CSM also everything is quite

Friends try to find the reasons not to take the trade will help u in long run.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
AU trade after news, just took 5 pips on one min. if i let it run can fetch more pips.  but profit is profit.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I am a bit lost on how exactly do you decide to enter a trade.  Would you mind showing the moment you would enter a trade.  It's just the TMZ is constantly changing in size (due to PA) so I a bit lost.  For some reason, the first few posts where to enter a trade is not "clicking" in my head. Thank in advance.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
AU +5

EU+15, miss the whole move not infront of laptop but manage to take the last move movement is very good so i took it.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi Singha,

Entry is the issue on which i am working there are two options for us to enter one is set pending order at 50% of the candle on which MTZ formed  stop loss on the other side of the  MTZ 2nd option is market order for this wait for pull back and look for the market momentum  and also CSM for pairs to look which one is week and which one is strong.

I hope this helps.

Close at +5 pips.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Why i close it .

But in forex when u r done for the day, greed is not good.

I am happy for 25 pips.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
True. I had a total of 122pips from AJ, AU, GA and greedily held on for more till it reduced to 50 pips, even that i kept hoping it will bounce back. guess what i ended up -70 pips this morning.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
EJ 5 min chart Close half position, using CSM with MTZ

--- 帖子 #405 ---
+20

Total for the day +45.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I try to go for 1:2 RR. Max stop loss 10 pips. that is the only thing we can control in this market is placement of our SL.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Nice trades, any alarm for TZ's break out?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Thanks,

No not yet but i think it is not required. we can trade whithout alarm also. u have to be focused when candle is going to finish and its better if u go with the CSM, trade the pair which is strong and week with MTZ.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thank you, yes is not difficult to check every 15 minutes.

Hi Albert. Please help me to understand something.. So you are taking trades when xixi_tz box form on the candle not on the candle wick? Like in the image attached?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #417 ---
how  could identify the entry for long with using TZ indicator ,then how could u set a SL & TP for short trade wht are the conditions ,let me explain ?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
You could most probably do better with a plain forward gap finder type indicator.I'm not alluding to weekend gaps.. the in between stuff.

1min and 5 min charts.

Do investigate.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
UJ +10, 5PIP RISK AND 10 PIP PROFIT.

Why i took this one b,cuz dollar is below in CSM + MTZ i knew that price will touch round no.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Yes. we areonly interested in the middle zones created.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
EJ close half position SL move to BE

--- 帖子 #422 ---
AJ look what it did took me out and then hit the TP level.

But it happens cant win them all. but my SL is 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Will it make or not ???

but my SL is 5 pips only

--- 帖子 #424 ---
AU +10

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Where is exactly your entry point? it's clear that you wait for a retracement after the middle TZ. But are you waiting for a 50% retrace or do you enter when it 'feels' right? and you are aiming always for a 2:1 RR?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Am loving your trading style. Very impressive. in fact am convinced now about the combination of the Currency strenght metre. Am taking trades with the CS and the MTZ's. It gives you confidence in the market.  Thanks Jeetvirk.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
jeetvirk, what broker are you using? Im using GlobalPrime but my TZ indi doesnt appear on some pairs and if it appears, only on daily TF.Thanks!

--- 帖子 #428 ---
This is the area i need to work on my friend, but best is 50%, at the moment i am entrying when i feel right.

thanks

regards.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Mario chk your message box.

regards

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Thanks jeetvirk. I use the  h-8 as settings. Its strange as it appears on some pairs but not on the others and even on some timeframes. Will try another broker.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Yes, even Fx-Jay mentioned in one of his posts that he is using TZ with CSM. Im not sure if its  middle TZ.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
H=8 is one of my favorite h, especially for big TF. But i use h=8 on M15, try scalp using TZ. Still do not know the result, i must check it in real time for some weeks ...  Thanks for the ideas, this is a nice thread.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Albert i don't like the wick on top and moreover this pair is already moved 100 pips so don't think it will move further.

my views only.

USD is slave today and EUR is boss Since london open.

Hi Mario can u provide me link if possiable

--- 帖子 #437 ---
How we can correlate the CSM with MTZ, in this GU chart the Good MTZ but on the other hand On CSM Pound and USD both are at same place so not a good idea to trade this MTZ.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hey Albert look at this i think it hit ur tp..

Perfect example of 50% entry.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
What do you think about a strictly rule based entry:

Drawind Fibonacci to the last M15 Candle.

Short Sell Limit on 38.2 with a SL on 76.4 and a Target of 2:1

Long Buy Limit on 61.8 with a SL on 23.6 and a Target of 2:1.

Of course always based on CSM!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Well Hoffi i think entry should be always at 50%, and SL on the other side of the MTZ or 10 pips. But when there is a good momentam  in the market we need to act fast.

The other way is we can enter half lot at market order and other half by pending order at 5o%. with the same stop loss.

what do u think.

regards

jeet

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Yaaay. That was sweet.

--- 帖子 #442 ---

No more trades for today. I think  am done. hmmmmm soo many pips all over.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
No, This pair also moves more than 200 pips and there is a Triple bottom now and from last 3 days it is in range of 200 pips, so be carefull about it and if ur daily target reaches just close the moniter and enjoy ur day.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
How do we control the edge not to trade. I have been battling with that forever.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Too late Jeet. Saw just saw your post. Bad habits.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Move to demo account once u r done with live account. its like doing practice for big match.

Do some yoga and drink atleast 15 lts of water every day.

Think other way, like try to find reasons not to trade.

keep ur losses small. small SL big TP key to sucess in forex.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
There are problems on both sides:

When entering on 50% you have a very good RR. But the following candle often goes further and doesn't come to 50 %. With the market order and a SL at the top (when trading in short direction) of the MTZ candle it is very hard to get a RR of 2:1.

Regards

Btw.: I think it is a very good method to catch the momentum. We just have to find the right entry for a good RR!

--- 帖子 #451 ---
jeetvirk, here  http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...57#post8135957

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thanks mario i will see to it.

but one thing more i would like to share if anybody wants to best trader he or she should make his own trading style its good to learn from the FF but to be successful one has to trade in own style use the available resources but try to find own style then only u will be a successful and that only comes with the practice and chart reading. and last don't look for diff systems that is just time wast.  sorry for English.

thanks

regards

--- 帖子 #455 ---
had the same GU trade +20

and there was a pendin order on GA but wasn't hit!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
its better to be not in the trade than a losing trade. best time to trade this system is london open or NY open.

i dont know how this CSM is working i think if CSM takes the data from tick we can improve our results.

what u think.

regards.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I think it is based on tick data. There is also a excel CSM available here on FF. The strenghts are almost the same.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
This is 2 pip risk to get 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
very nice, wasn't at my desk otherwise I would have taken this one, too!

NU +15 on 1 hour risk is 7 pips. done for today. close below big round no.

CSM, MTZ and london open is pure gold.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
AT london open take ur desk with u where ever u r going.

just kidding.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
looks like there were many good opportunities in 1 hour timeframe in the ongoing hour for GA, AU, EN, EA, UC, etc with a potential to earn atleast 250 to 300 pips...

by the way... jeetvirk@ may i know you daily target and your goal and how you have decided this please? this would help us to have some discipline...

--- 帖子 #463 ---
jeetvirk, are you using default settings for CSM?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hello,

I am new in this thread, seems interesting, and would be helpful for those who wants to take forex as a living.........i dont understand one thing....in first post deposit 100$ making profit and compuding turns 40000$ at the end of the year, How is it possible.

I will try this system from this week

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Try this Tareghasan. compounding does the trick and securing those 10pips

i love this trading

--- 帖子 #467 ---
My first trade for the day

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I use the parabolic to place my stop loss. Tp is +11 stoploss is 11

--- 帖子 #469 ---
For those struggling to identify a potential MTZ, I will take it one step at a time.

1. The currency strength indicator helps us to choose the most liquid markets to trade, preferably I want a pair in the red and blue zones of the indicator.

2. My stop loss is with the parabolic sar. I leave the take profit to you. My daily target is 20pips and i am on the 15min TF

--- 帖子 #470 ---
hi Albertdkpllh,

i have downloaded the CSM indicator but the problem is that i have weak currency on top and strong at the bottom...could u please help me so that i can have it like urs..strong on top and weak at the bottom.

hi guys

its working now

Thanks

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi albert,

I try your system yesterday, able to catch +12 pips. Thanks a lot. Now i am little busy, thats why not be able to attached the image.

another point i dont have time to test it on demo. i made +12 pips in real account. ............lol

But one question to you. As i service man i saw that 30 min and 15 min gives me some sort of mental pressure during my working hour. I prefer to trade 1H. What do you think about it.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
If that candle closes like that we will have a potential MTZ.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Thats how the candle closed. but this may not be a good example for the CSM.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi friends,

EA late entry i was thinking should i go for it or not because of round no at 1.46000, but took it because of momentum now close the half trade stop loss at BE.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Tradeforlife sorry for late answer i was not at home, well i try to take 20 pips every day but some time i have to manage with 15 pips i think it all depends on person to person how much they want from market or one is willing to lose in the market. but once i reach my target i just watch price action no trading. this helps me building patience in me.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi Mario yes it is default no changes i think it is working fine with this.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hello Albertdkpllh and thank you for all your work!

Can I ask you 3 things:

1. What is your Parabolic settings (for SL)?

2. Which pairs do you trade?

3. Is your H=8 for any one pair?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi, my H is 10, parabolic is default settings, I trade all the major pairs but especially the pairs that the CSM give me but the spread must be good.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Keep it up. Remember, set your targets, don't over trade. Entries with precision like a sniper and you need to get a fixed stop loss.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
10 pips a day It's simple and almost mechanical.

When a new daily Bar shows up, set a Buy Stop Order in the High of the previous Candle and a Sell Stop Order in the Low of that Candle.

TP: 10 Pips.

SL: The Low of the previous candle for the Buy and the High of the previous candle for the Sell.

​Even so, you may not be comfortable with the R:R ratio. I recommend attach this parameter (SL) to a relative value, such as the 40% of the ATR(10), for example.

Or an intelligent Trailing Stop, which behaves different depending if you are above or below the Break-Even value.

For the purpose, you will need to code an EA .

Works well in EUR/USD, but have a look at other low-spread charts.

Great job Albert, let me add one point here whenever u set TP level near round no always set at  .100 when u sell and when buy set at .900 if u look back at history price always hit .100 and .900 mark reverse.

I dont have it on this screen but have you seen the ADX, it had room to go thats why I entered. I also use the same CSM on another system its always good to get on the right side of some decent liquidity. As for the news yes I was concious of that.

Thanks for your input dude you know better than me how this system works I will look forward to discussing it further with you

Hey Albert, nice application of the transient zone principle. Though not perfect but great. I also trade the transient zone principle but differently. Why not create a trade explorer to track your progess.

Sure thanks anyway

Alright, who is now going to program a TZ/CSM combination dashboard?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
For those trading the middle tz i had a signal to long usdcad at 1.2143 lows but missed it. Long usdcad anywhere below 1.2249 thats suits you. Preferably when you get your middle ptz or tz signal. Profit target is 100pips or more. You can check my thread to follow up this trade. Pls note that your entry is 100pips late so expect some drawdown

usdjpy. long usdjpy at the open of the next 4hr candle or on your middle bar ptz signal. Profit potential is 150pips or more. Follow i up on my thread

thank me later

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I don't see how you can make money.  It seems to me that price bounces off as many or more than it goes through.  If you are taking the trade after price actually goes through the box I can see the trade.  Is that how you trade?  I see some entries made while price is still inside the box.  What am I missing?

Nice!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Such beauty, waiting for the effects of the Cad high profile news in 45min....

Not in any of these. Was being mindful of the pending news.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I hope some off you took this trades. Slowly but surely we will get to the destination. If cad news is bad a crazy usdcad rally expect

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Just to bring to your notice what I have observed. Normally when we have two TZ's following each other in series without an opposite TZ seperating them it usually indicates a turn around or the end of that direction. see pics below.

You realise we have a TZ and a potential one forming in both cases, should they confirm TZ's then we will have two TZ's in a row, the hint is to be looking for opportunities in the opposite.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Another example of what i mean. However this is not to derail us from the Potential MTZ's that we are trading.

In this example I will be looking for buy opportunities.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Another example.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Great! You've observed some of the regular behaviours of equal sided TZs. Keep it going! Great trades!

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Good TZ student. More work to be done keep it up.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hes a good similarity student.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hope am not the only one looking at this. I think it has everything we need.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Not only Middle?

Dear friends,

please correct me if I understand the rules wrong.

We buy if the focus candle forms middle TZ and closes higher then it. SL = parabolic's point under the focus candle. TP = what I want

But. Can we formalize the vice versa rule?

------------ We sell if the focus candle forms top TZ and closes lower then it ----------------

As I can see at history of your screenshots, it can be rule.

Please, correct, me.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
I think that what you'll find is that certain timeframes will display certain types of alternating patterns. Not all pairs are the same.

Let me know if you start experimenting with Uneven TZs, eg. one side greater than the other.  You'll find these at tops and bottoms.  Middle ones are constant.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Not the only one

Am I right with this parameters of entry and sl tp?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
. Thanks Vlady.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Lets see how it goes

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Can you please explain what you mean. Trying to understand what you mean.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Remember what i said earlier, they also fail.they runaway trend is the drawback . They are like a ticking time bomb, that can blow up the unskilled tz user. But youre on the right track

--- 帖子 #560 ---
what is your TP?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
closed for +27pips. Done for the day.

--- 帖子 #562 ---

--- 帖子 #563 ---
You should be done by now.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Good job

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Your boxes still show after the price has penetrated them.  Mine dissapear before I can place trade.  I am using the last template provided.  Am I doing something wrong?

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I mean to sell if the candle closed lower then topTZ (it's not middleTZ).

I think I saw lots of examples of this situation at other users screenshots.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Add:

But I see Parabolic still says "Buy"

Hm

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Please that is wrong and very much against our rules. We take trades in the direction of the potential MTZ's, hoping that they will remain confirmed MTZ's. Now with that in mind we have confidence that we are in the right direction. Trading against the potential is for another thread. We always trade in the direction of the Potential MTZ.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
That's how the Double bottom turned out.

Interesting

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Sure!

I just ask, is it right idea that comes from and vice versa general MTZ? It's not a proble m for me to start a new thread, but I just try to get know before - basing at your experience - is this vice-versa-strategy still works at 97%?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Am not sure if it works, but i know others trade like that.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi,  Albertdkpllh

I am new in this thread ....

This system does not use the level of Psychology ----> to see and prepare planning before prices move in future prices.

and oscalator to look over sell, or over buy.

this is example :

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hi Dingdong, Hope you good. This system has everything you want except of course how to manage your trades, that, i belief comes with individual skill and experience.

You mentioned " does not use the level of Psychology ----> to see and prepare planning before prices move in future prices". I do not underdtsnd what you mean by that, but I know it builds your patients and calms your emotions especially when it comes to triggering the entry button. It gives you most of the hints to you need to know where you will get your 10 pips for sure.

We could go on and on with the psychology of this system, but i am however more interested in the "oscalator to look over sell, or over buy," .......that you mentioned.

Hmmmmm the system again presents or puts before you one of the sweetest, in fact, two indicators am sure you will love. I love those indicators.

1. The stockastic

2. Zigzag.

For your oversold/overbought situations you usually look to e.g the stockastic indicator. Hi Dingdong, can you please tell me, what do you do when the oscillator gets to the overbought zone. Do you close your trade if you were in a buy?, or do you sell once you reach overbought zone,........ Take the zigzag for instance, in my experince trading i thougt when a zigzag leg appeared it indicated trading in the opposite direction, how many of us did'nt get burned doing that.

The picture below show us what happens when the zigzag moves into overbought/ oversold zones, all the lines show is the stockastic at the overbought zone

and how price reacts to that..........that is where we find most of our MTZs........ to be cont.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Again Dingdong......I think we should be able to tell when we can sell that overbought situation too. Cheers .

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I'm not sure, but you can see the chart, with little explanation. Brother Albertdkpllh

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I think this picture is a little too complex for me oo.

Why don't we look at the pic below. Sister Dingdong, maybe am not understanding your earlier statement.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
yes ... yes ......

no problem, Brother. just an idea ...

I forgot, it only took 10 pip ...

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Am interested in what you were driving at please, am sure am not understanding your idea, please share.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Dingdong could you take the concept and indicator and make a dash from it? So we can see MTZ forming on multiple pairs with the rest of our filters you are well aware of the CSM as ive followed your dashboard thread.

--- 帖子 #580 ---

Hello!

Sorry, but

what's the problem here? If your SL is at the Parabolic's circle? It's far from current price (at the moment of screenshot).

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Sure would be nice if someone could make a PDF file containing entire system with all rules, indicators and template.

Sorry, it did not happen.

This is an example of a double bottom TZ in formation, I expect price to move upward, and not go below the zones. Now a potential MTZ shows below the zone am will expect a heavy drop. Price usually goes up.

Dear fathers of this trading technic

How do you think,

what is the maximum spread for this strategy? (for TP=20 and SL~10)

I had this problem too.  Set your "bar limit" in the xixi's input to "300."   Should fix the issue.

Hello friends, this is EA chart after the Aus trade balance news after new as u can see on 5 min chart i draw two lines and left it actually i want to see what happens at these lines my point is that For entry we can use Support and Resistance also which is very effective also u can back test it.

As u can see in the chart these lines become Support after news give very good entry point first one (Upper one) is week support price did react to it and went 10 pips up and as u can see the second support (Lower one) is at very strong level price react to it and went up for 35 pips.

@jeet, at how many pips in profit do you start to set your stop to BE?

--- 帖子 #694 ---
From next week set and forget Rule.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
+5

--- 帖子 #696 ---
I'm doin quiet the same...

When my TP is set at 10 pip I move to BE at +5

When I have a TP set at 20 pip I move to BE at around 12 - 15 Pips of profit.

Sometimes I decide to handle it different, especially with some pairs with higher volatility like EA or GA.

They can shot to +15 and on the next minute they pull back to catch your BE stop and then they hit your TP in the very next minute...

Hi Albert, im new here and i want to thank you first for your help.

my question is do you still use H 18 for the 15m time frame?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
H=18?

I saw H=8 at the start of the thread and H=10 for now. Am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
When you have a smaller H you will have more Potential MTZs forming. The bigger the H, the more quality your entries, of course with good MM.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I think you need to enter a pair as soon as one of the currency move to the top in the CSM. If you enter after a long time it is at top, then most of the movement is done by that time. Jeetvirk@ please correct me if i'm wrong.

I too caught EURJPY today for two 20 pips and AUDJPY one 5 pip...

it is actually not repainting... It excists a decent possibility that price action deletes the MTZs.

Hi Rox regarding your first entry it cross the RN 1.4800 what  i suggest u whenever the price cross RN try to enter after price retrace  because there are chances that it will touch RN and then move on.

just my view

regards

--- 帖子 #755 ---
hey guys i really like the thread. the signals the system provides are really amazing. there is just one thing i am struggling with. the round numbers. it dont really know how to handle them. should i just see them just as support and resistance areas? should i wait for PA at this lvls? what do they indicate?:nerd:

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Woow, this is quite simple.

- Look for a potential MTZ

- Once you notice one, you look at CSM......and CSM should be strong.

- Then, the break of S/R levels.

Thanks Jeet.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Do chart reading watch the price action near RN's then develop your own style.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
This is looking interesting.

Potential MTZ, almost there.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Yeah thanks for your suggestion jeet..I didn't notice that until you pointed it out..Seems I should re-add my levels indicator!

Haha.......well am now in.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
hahaaaah...cool..!

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Look what happens at red line right entry would easly give u 15 pips

--- 帖子 #764 ---
better move ur SL to BE because price is right at 50% fib of day before yesterdays up move.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Broken support and Retrace..!

--- 帖子 #766 ---
So what is better:

to wait for 50% pullback of MTZ candle

or enter immediatly?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
And still can't understand,

how H can be the same for different  TF

--- 帖子 #768 ---
That's just the setting of the indicator.  If you manually change tf and not the indicator, then it H would stay the same.

If you wanted different H for different tf then you would have to change it each time or get someone to amend that code to do it dynamically based on parameters you set.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Sure! I mean

is it ok to analise H1 and M15 whith the same H?

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Why not?

It's just a filter.

Timeframe 1H

h=8

You're saying for every 8 hours check to see if price has returned here or not. If not display box

Switch to 15M

For ever 8 x 15M (or 2 hours) check to see if price has returned here or not. If not display box

etc.....

Nothing wrong with that.

The question is.... how/what does it mean for you? Does it fit with how you trade?

--- 帖子 #771 ---
You are right. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #772 ---
so multiply 15m for 8 to get the H for 15m? or what is the H for 15m? please

--- 帖子 #773 ---
H is nothing but the number of bars at the left and right. If the H is set as 8, then when the price is at a new level which it didn't visit within those left 8 bars, then potential TZ appears and if the price again didn't revisit that price for the next 8 bars (right), then that will price or zone will become completed transient zone. You are looking for a potential TZ and then taking the trade assuming that the price is not going to revisit that price within the next 8 bars. setting H is upto you. You can set any number as you wish.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
The question is that, will you pull the trigger when you see one forming????? Keep in mind that there is no guarantee a potential MTZ will become MTZ. But then again when you look at your historical data you will see all the places you could have taken that chance.

Our friend Jeet, added some strong filters, CSM and S/R.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I took my chance with this one expecting that it will give me some pips at least before dancing around. It went 10pips at least could have taken the 10 pips or at least pulled to break even, suggested by Jeet, however, i decided to take my chances further and manage the trade, moving the stoploss from -75pips to -54pips as shown in the pic below. I am still optimistic that price will go down.

It may not go all the way down, but managing the trade is very critical here.

Thank you

Hi Albert,

What currency pairs have you been focusing on?  And from those pairs, do you pick the ones with most volitily or because there is a setup at that moment?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Great weekend to all.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi Fxchaser, I trade all pairs provided CSM is good and there is a setup.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
I just want to give this wonderfull thread my contribution!

Here are my 2 templates Iam using.

The first one is my main info chart with a news calendar, profit info, all pair spread info and the CSM

and here is my trading chart with all necessary infos like daily range, lot size calculator CSM etc.

plus I added another CSM with slopes for a better visualisation of the strength! actually, this indicator is a bit CPU consuming, so I recoomend you to use it on max 4 pairs. and when you change the pair, give it a bit time!

Gooood morning guys!

started the day with my first loss with this system...

and the reason was impatience, not looking at the CSM plus the wrong timeframe I wanted to look on...

So GU -10

GCAD with +6 (would have made it to +14)

for now Iam down by -4 pips...

So Iam done for the day

everyone some nice green pips, see ya's later

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Lol!!!! Ma, sorry about the loss, but are you sure you want to spy on the US session......don't be tempted oo. Congrats

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Again my emotions played a part today. I was in +50 today morning but I was not able to close those trades as my emotions told they are still moving in my way and then lost all those pips... this is what happening for me for last few days. my target was to achieve only 30 pips a day but i am not able to stop trading after achieving that... so i decided to start a journal here and post my progress daily so that i should feel some responsibility... just a try...

--- 帖子 #796 ---
This is an excellent idea.  I think with this particular strategy, you need a fixed exit point. Exit points are more important than Entry.  Entry creates risk. Exit stops risk.

For Middle TZ strategy, from what I have seen, you are relying on a move to confirm TZ.  This means a move could be any range that is acceptable to your parameter of 30 pips.  In your situation this morning, you should have moved your SL to +30 as soon as price was at least 10 pips above it because it is never guaranteed that price will move in a straight line.  Especially with no news.

I also suggest you create a separate journal and not crowd someone else's. This creates ownership and responsibility for you which means you'll end up picking better trades.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
may i assist to control ur emotional trades .. ? pls watch this pdf if u like ...

gud luck...

--- 帖子 #798 ---
You are right Vlady... Owning a journal creates responsibility to not to screw up things... I was in GBPJPY, AUDUSD and NZDJPY long today morning and combining all three, i was at more than +50, but the next Supply zone was not yet achieved, so I waited but they started retracing even before that....

I am very much grateful to Albert and Jeetvirk who actually helped me to find this route for me...

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Thanks us_fantasy.... I will definitely go through it...

--- 帖子 #800 ---
As a plan, this is great. The only caveat is that you need to incorporate being wrong into the plan.  The PDF shows a growing account with no losses.

It does not show RISK.  I would suggest that if you can maintain 20 working days off a plan that trades 2R or 3R, then increase your lot size.

This means that for your account's MAX risk, eg. 5%.... if this is 25 pips for example. Then you must consistently make 2R = 50 pips or 3R = 75 pips for 20 trading days before you increase lot size, otherwise you are not increasing your Trade Expectancy.

Risk games relate to money management based on strategy AND performance.... you can't just assume a strategy will increase to "account increasing" plan without yourself backtesting the strategy and working out its win/loss ratio.  In the absence of that, your entire money management goal is not to target pips but to reduce or manage risk.

To me, 30 pip goal implies 10 pip SL.... is this too tight or too big?  What is the average win range of MTZ?

--- 帖子 #801 ---
To be frank just yesterday I was deliberating on the meaning of trading. I thought through and deep, my realization was amazing.

What does a pip mean to us?.........

Can I take a pip daily?

Hmmmm If I started with a 1000$ account and traded daily 1 pip 10$ you will be risking all the 100 pips. The question still remains, can you take 1 pip a day, we see one pip everyday but we don't believe in it. if you can guarantee taking one pip per trade, consistently and compounding we will make it. I saw 80 pips on friday and like you I took it for granted. If I had taken even 20 pips I would have been very happy this weekend, guess what, I lost it and more.

We have to believe in the PIP, then gaining confidence we may add another pip. Jeet has been a great role model to me and I believe he inspires us all....... When he says he is done for the day he is done and he means it .

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Exactly Albert.

My insight is that trading is 3 things:

1) Confidence of Self Expression (via Strategy Implementation & Money/Risk Management)

2) Continuity of a Trading Business

3) Reward of Lifestyle Objectives

A pip is only worth it if you know how much you risked to earn it.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Thanks Vlady... As you told, I am going to keep the lot size constant for 20 working days without introducing the compounding now. After this, the next step would be to use compounding as well for next 20 days and see how it goes.... As you told, first we need to be confident in our trading plan.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
You were right Albert... Jeet is a great inspiration to me too and from him only i decided to target a constant pip on a daily basis without going for everything..(but still can't control it...)

--- 帖子 #805 ---
This should be inscribed in Marble and displayed on FF homepage!

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Nice trading guys!!!

Just went long on ECAD after pullbacl to the RN...

EDIT: out with plus 4

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Because indicator doesn't paint top and bottom zones, we trade middle zone breakout (on Your first image are two middle zones).

"Backtest" feature is forward backtest (it's impossible to paint previously dissapeared middle zones), so You need to run it and go back after few hours.

It seems, that good entry is always first appearance of PMTZ. I spend on it whole weekend and still finding edge. I trade only pairs with spread < 1.5. Red and green dots are potential exit points, it's my Exitcandlefinder indicator (download here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...66#post8382966).

Todays situation on EURUSD, You can't loss, yellow lines are entry points, 1. SL on BE, 2. profit +~30, 3. SL, 4. profit +~50-60.

Edit: 1. should be exited in profit on red dot and 3. should not be taken, but we need mathematical rule for it, because i want to automate it.

Edit2: Oh and if You mean candles I use Heiken Ashi candles, they are better for good entry recognition - entry only on candle without opposite wick.

Also Iam very curious what the US boys have in paln with the EURUSD.

my plan #1 is, they smash it really hard to the downside...

plan #2 is, at least they will retest the previous high and let it go in a range for the rest of the day...

but when I look on the chart and see the slowly downward move after the big push, I will look for a nice short entry.

Hi redfan, I think the H value in your indicator is different from mine. yours is 10 whiles mine is 18

--- 帖子 #938 ---
OK no ONE is interested, here is updated version, variable "FirstOpOnly" You get only one alert in long or short direction, mostly good probability. I don't posted template, because I'm still testing, TDI based on RSI is messy. Probably no one is interested here, I can post high probability rules... Just share Your success, TF and pair... On M5 be satisfied with 2 - 10 pips only! ((Huuh middle zone breakout is always better then fractal breakout what many traders use - middle zone is like middle fractal))

BTW I plan to run any entry on live account with aggressive trade manager.

BTW2: better then Nihilist Holy Grail is "xSuperTrend Tape.mq4" for entries...

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Higher h mean latter entry, You need other filter, I tested h=8 vs h=12 on M5 and h=8 is giving better entry. You need other filter.

Please, just post Your requests here, because, You loss, I am ready to improve indicator, my friend posted me His opinion... Its 100% sure, that You will be succes...

BTW I am trader, I don't earn money on users!

--- 帖子 #940 ---
I am sorry, set "FirstOpOnly" to true and You will get one alert per direction only, if You are still not satisfied, set "BacktestArrows" to false (default is true).

Edit: Its hard to say H1 is better then M15, on H1 You get alert 20 pips latter, You need proof, that pair is trending...

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Targeting 120 pips.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
ok. thanks.

if possible, can you explain the rule that you use.... for entry?

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Hi Albert! Nice to see your results!

I see you use two ways of research:
http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1438784694
http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1438757223

What is the reason of using 2 templates and can you share them?

What is your TP and SL at M5 and M15?

Thank you for your support! More green pips to you!

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Almost there....

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Hi,

Its the same principle for the two except that, the stockastic for one is more responsive to the activities of the price. I aim at the round numbers for my TP

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Target Hit, 120 pips gain

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Thanks!

How do you use Parabolic now?

--- 帖子 #978 ---
I was using it to trrail my stops but it was getting me out of good trades so i have dropped it. Instead I use the swing lows for my stops.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
EURGBP (detected by Currence Strenght)

Sell (MTZ, AO, Stoch)

SL - 0.69867 (swing high)

Target - 0.69500

"Am I doing right?"

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Reverse and SL. Again and again

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Why sell since80808, the nihilist adx is all green.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Target. 50pips

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Sorry Since80808, i'll furnish you with a template and entry set up soon.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
out for +12 pips.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
when when when when???

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Hi, okay this thread is still work in progress, I may have changed my templates a lot but the core substance is intact in all of them which is to use the MTZ's to our advantage. In my most recent trades i try to follow the trend. I will explain.

--- 帖子 #987 ---
In this picture, the major indicators in play are the AO, the stockastics and the MTZ.

1. I have two Stockastics overlying each other. The slow one shows me the trend direction and the fast one for entries.

2. The most important here are the stockastics. I watch them closely.

3. AO indi must be in agreement for all my entries, PMTZ indi tells me to relax and sleep, am in the right direction.

Lets pay attention to the AO and Stock. The purple line shows where the AO moved into a position, BUT my slow stock (white stock) is still in the buy position, thus above the zero line. NO trade entries yet.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Now by the time price gets to the yellow line, the slow stock has moved to the sell zone. This tells me we are in a sell trend now. I dont look to higher time frames.

Now i need the fast stock to pull up, VERY important. I still don't have an entry yet.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
The green line shows my entry point. At the close of the candle the fast stock must cross the slow stock. Never assume that the stock will cross when it has'nt crossed and confirmed.

The level of the price corresponding with the pull back in the fast stock gives us where to place the stop loss.

Very ofthen the PMTZ is seen around these areas. Its always relieving to see a PMTZ forming, it gives you that edge.

ALL SETUPS MUST HAVE THE AWESOME INDI IN AGREEMENT.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
This is looking like a potential set up. You have to be patient and wait for the fast stock to cross the slow stock and the candle must close. lets see how this develops.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Waiting for the candle to close. If the fast stock crosses as shown in the pic I will take the trade.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Trying to get 35 pips.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Is this the exact spot one would make an entry to go short?

--- 帖子 #994 ---
closed for 10 pips.... Price is reacting too much on the round number.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Yep

--- 帖子 #996 ---
This is looking good.

But the fast stock must cross the slow one for a confirmed entry.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Targeting 20 each

--- 帖子 #998 ---
First target hit one more to go.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
target hit...+42 pips

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Hi Albert!

I realy thank you for your explanation of your technic!

So, at this indicators combination you don't use MTZ (and Currency Strength), right?

Also I'd like to ask, which pairs do you trade?

Thank you again for your time and attention.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
Hello ALbertdkpllh can you shear the same stochastic with SAM combined that you are using.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
I trade the Pound pairs mainly especially GA, GJ, GN, GC, GCad.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
The template has the setup

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
The pull backs in the fast stock gives us the levels for our SL. Best of luck trading this week.

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Again before you enter the trade you can always check what your SL will be, if it is acceptable then you can go ahead to trade otherwise you move on to other opportunities.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
And also for trailing your stop

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Good morning. targeting 20 pips

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Target 35 pips. SL -14

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Closed for +17 pips.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Good entry point.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Hello Albert!

Researching your charts I can see that you trade all pairs combinations from the Currency Strenght Indicator, right? Have you noticed that some of them are not good for your rules (need another parameters of indicators)? So you use GBP pairs, EURAUD and which more?

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
I do not trade markets based on the CSI anymore, the setup can be found on every market. Very ofthen the setup comes before the CSI, the setup even leads the MTZ sometimes. The setup actually stands alone without supporting indicators.

I decided not to trade the EURAU because i was in another trade, but you will see that currently my stop would have been at about 25pips targeting +30 pips. That setup was perfect. CSI will always show what is happening in the markets. Again MTZ showed up which is good.

The picture below shows the setup again with entry and SL.  Damn!!!!!!...... should have taken this trade

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Pulled to BE with this one. You will notice CSI is not exactly in  agreement.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
If I were to take this trade am sure to have my 30pips but the initial SL level is -77pis away.

Notice that this setup has MTZ supporting but where is CSI?

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Should have taken this trade. good luck to you

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Missed this one entirely.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Can't believe I had just +23pips today.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Another example of a perfect entry

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
hey albert i want to ask you? how do u notice that the mtz is forming? do it has some kind of alert?

then how many pips u target everyday?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Hello Albert!

Thank you again for all your ideas!

Now I test them + real time MTZ signals at demo account.

I mentioned that several (GBP and not only) medium (yellow) news are actual for this strategy because of low TF. So have to analise the calendar before opening the trade.

Good luck and green pips!

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Hey Albert and jeet,

Iam sorry for not posting in the near past, but unfortunately I feel not really confident to trade...

I will be back with alot of pips when everything has settled down

so long, a lot of greens to all of you!

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Targeting +67

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Closed for +46pips

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
New experience: not to trade right near the "round numbers" levels - strong support|resistance

(vertical lines show setup appearance)

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
You are right. Also i look for pullbacks to the 50 line at least.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Do you mean middle between round numbers or Fibo50?

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
I mean the 50 line on the oscillators.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Could you please illustrate such situation with your firm images texts?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
GJ +20

its easy to trade MTZ after news on 5 min chart

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
GA +7

Close manual

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
hey jeetvirk, do you ever have losing days ? You seem very good.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Hi guys,

--- 帖子 #1034 ---

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Hey guys, what is a good setting for 4h and 1D

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
hello friends, I am new at this thread and confused about top tz, bottom tz and middle tz. Should we always trade with only mtz?

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Hey guys, I find this method interesting. If the key is to have price close above the MTZ for a buy... Any chance to request some good heart coders to help add an alert to the indicator(attached)? My thanks humbly!

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
look for post 210.. you will get this indi with alert

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
