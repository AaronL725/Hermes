Trading made possible with EsikeA+++ Trading made possible with EsikeA+++ is a very simple, robust, effective and trend following system with confirmations and enhancements to ensure and increase the profitability. This trading system is high performing system and focus on trend identification and how to join the trend. The 3 main components/structures: 1. 5ema - main chart. 2. Welles WeldersDMI - window 1. 3. TrendMirror - window 2. The Entrance: 1. 5ema - the trigger: - Main chart: - Arrow - 5 ema with a 2 shift. * Red Arrow - Short/Sell. * Lime/Green Arrow - Long/Buy. 2. Trend: Price vs the Daily Open &amp; DPP: - Main chart: a.) Price above the daily open line (white dotted line) &amp; DPP = Buy. b.) Price below the daily open line (white dotted line) &amp; DPP = Sell. 3. DMI: - Window 1: i.) DMI's crossing. ii.) ADX must be above one of the DMI's. iii.) ADXr must be above 20 level. DMI Color: 1. Red line: DMI - (sell). 2. Green line: DMI+ (buy). 3. Red dotted line: ADX. 4. Yellow line: ADXr. 4. TrendMirror: - Window 2: Level 1 Entry 1.The Price To Open (1440) color must be established first, and then the ASH change to match it. 2. The Price To Open (60) color must be established first, and then the ASH change to match it. 3. AbsoluteStrengthHisto2 - (ASH). 6. WUKAR News: - Window 3: i.) Lime bars : When it is safe according to the rules. ii.) Red bars : When between 1 hour before and 30 minutes after news. iii.) DarkGray bars : For the next 30 minutes as a warning to be careful as news may still have an impact yet. Trading Pairs: I trade EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, and USDJPY, but it will work on any pairs. Timeframe: This trading system works on all time frames, but I trade off M30 TF. My Charts: I use 5 charts: i.) Chart with data and News - load with EsikeCalender.tpl. ii.) EURUSD M30. iii.) GBPUSD M30. iv.) AUDUSD M30. v.) USDJPY M30. Trading Hours: London open to London close - ( target/focus hours: 1st 3 hours of London open and 1st 3 hours of NY open). Trading Rules: 1. No trading H1 before Red news and M30 after Red news. 2. Do not enter trades when the size of the last candle is more than double the ATR of that pairs for that day. 3. Do not enter trade in the first M15 of a new market open. 4. Don't regard all triggers as trade setups. 5. Maximum of 4 trades per day (1 trade per day will do you). 6. Always take a look at the ABR/ATR status, 10ema dashboard, Strength meter and Ichimoku status before taking your trade. 7. Always go by the way of the Daily Open and the DPP - price above =buy / price below =sell. 8. Use Fibonacci Retracement and do not take the signals which are beyond 78.6%. 9. Make PDF &amp; BCC your guide. Money/Trade Management: 1. MM =2%. 2. TP = 40pips. 3. SL = 20pips. 4. BE/Lock-in-pips = 20pips 5. Daily Target = 40pips. 6. Stop trading after reaching daily target. 7. Stop trading after 2 consecutive losses. When not to trade: 1. When ADX is below both DMI lines or ADXr is below 20 level. 2. When the shadow/wick of candle is bigger than candle body of that candle that cross the 5ema. 3. When we see "Porcupine" candles. 4. When we see Support/Resistance Ahead. Checklist: 1. 5ema - (the trigger) – maximum of 2 candles after the trigger and must correspond/line- up with level 1 entry . 2. DMI - both the ADX &amp; ADXr must be inside the DMI's. 3. TrendMirror - level 1 entry. 4. + Others: a.) Price vs the Daily Open/DPP. b.) Strength meter - single/double effect. c.) 10ema dashboard. d.) Ichimoku status - Sync in pairs. e.) ABR/ATR status. Happy trading, Yomi. Setups:

Thanks for sharing your system. Trying to set it up on my terminal to analyse possible setups. Though I am having trouble finding the correct settings... 1) When does the arrow plot ? At directional change of 5EMA ? 2) Which are the ADX settings and which MA did you add to it ? 3) Which timeframe can it be used ? Thanks a lot and merry christmas, sjust2fast

Hi, if i uderstand correctly the "Price EMA Breakout" arrow is the trigger when the rest of all conditions are met: - for buy blue stochs above the red (climbing) and for sell blue stochs below the red (falling) - DMI cross - ADXr above 20 level What for are kingpips arrows? Some kind of reentry? Regards

Hi, I tried to run the EA, however, the Journal listed that two files could not be opened - EsikeM15Bomb.ex4 and #PricetoOpen 1440.ex4. Are those missing or my setting is wrong? Please advise. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
The EA has nothing to do with this thread, it was made specifically for another system in another thread, that is the reason why I turned it off. I'm only making use of it here to takes all my trades and to manage all my trades here, period. Happy trading, Yomi.

Thanks fxrabbi, Very interesting. I will try to post trades as i see them but i am not sure if I am able to adhere to the time frame you have specified due to the timezone I live in and daily obligations. As for the chart I see a solid arrow when MA crosses over which is sometimes followed by a hollow, unfilled arrow. What is the meaning of this unfilled arrow? Regards, 2UP

GBPJPY +14.4pips. Trade Ideas: 1.The talking Stochs all the way - Rope, Rope, Rope..... 2. Price under the 2 MA's. 3. Cross of the DMI's Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hello Yomi, Thank you for this. Question: from the files i used i do not see the open arrows. I do see the filled arrows. Second question: i do not see the currency strength like your screenshot. "above the buy sell buttons" How can i get these? Thanks, Jef

--- 帖子 #46 ---
No problem, take it here: The second arrow you asked about is there in the 1st post, it name is kingpips01 - it works like CCI indicators. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Yomi, I am new to this but i believe this trade is showing as per your rules. Could you please comment at your leisure 2uP EURJPY M15 ( Entry trigger As i have interpreted them (novice) 5 EMA crossing Solid Arrow indicating that price has crossed the 5 ema. At that time the stoch is topping and the blue stoch line has merged with the red stoch line. Two candles later a second hollow arrow appears. Don't quite understand the relevance of this second arrow. Comments are welcome. Talki ng Stoch Fishnet slowly disappearing and merging in rope with one colour showing. Lines of the stoch all merge by the time the lines crosses the 50 line Wilder's DMI DMI crossed a few candles back but the lines were converging ADXR above 20 and ADR below one of the DMI lines MA Fast MA(72) above slow moving MA(24) Entered @ first 00/50 level TP(30)/SL(15) Sorry for this lengthy post but I am just trying to grasp the rules as Yomi has presented them 2uP

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Yomi, My chart and your chart differ in the position of the ADXR when your trade was taken. In my chart the position of the ADXR was well below the 20-line while in your chart it is slightly above it. What could make up this difference and how relevant is this. Also should all the rules be met before the trigger is entered or can one be substituted for another ie. MA crossing for the 20 level of the ADXR? 2uP

The red line is below 20, you should not have made the trade if i am not mistaken. Good though that you got your pips.

Hi, By the way, as far as this ADX....indicator is concerned, anyone can tell me : What is the Red line ? and what is the dotted red line ? Thanks in advance. Best regards. BBF

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi fxrabbi, thanks for sharing. I have two questions. For the EMA trigger do we need to have the price above both EMA for buy and below EMAs for selling? I think yes but want to make sure... What is the strenght indicator that you are using on your template? Thanks a lot.

Please check post 16. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi, Please don't miss up the 5ema with the 2 MA's. The 5ema is the trigger and it's in the form of an arrow. The other 2 MA's are the 24 and 72 MA's, so if the price is above these 2 MA's you go long and if below you go short. I have share the strength indicator that I use in post 46. Happy trading, Yomi.

I dont understand please fxrabbi how to enter position? When sell when buy ?

Delete the EA

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Got it. But why are some arrows full and others empty?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Oganla, thank you for your presence here. We use the talking Stochs in the 3 following ways: 1. Rope - sell &amp; buy. 2. DodgerBlue (Blue) lines inside climbing FireBrick (Red) wall, will always result in price rising/climbing - Buy. 3. DodgerBlue (Blue) lines inside falling FireBrick wall, will always result in price falling - Sell. See the attached charts for better understanding. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I have been using this system since 2013 with some little modification to it. As for the skype, I don't have that time to go on skype. I believe this avenue is enough for us to teach and learn this system. Happy trading, Yomi

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Yomi, I'm sorry I missed this 16's post. Thanks a lot for your quick answer... I take advantage of the time to wish you an Happy new year and lots of green pips ! Best regards BBF

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Delete the EA.... I believe you did not know the work of the EA, because if you know you will not delete it. The benefits of the EA is as follows: 1. It serves as Script for placing trade: Inthe form of buttons. i.) Pending order. ii.) Market price order. 2. It serves as Script for closing your trades: i.) in profit. ii.) All - both winning and losing trades. 3. It serves as EA for trade/money management: i.) MM - adjustable. ii.) TP, SL &amp; BE - pre- determined. So, please don't delete!!! Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
The other arrow that's not full is called kigpips01 and it works like CCI indicator. The full arrow is the 5ema - our trigger. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thank you and wish you the same here. Seeing you at our threads is always my delight. Happy trading, Yomi.

So if price is below 2 emas we only search for sell right? If above buy only?

AUDJPY (M15) + 39,9 pipsy.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Yomi, A question if I may. You mentioned somewhere in this great thread that when 5ema cross (momentum change) shows up on top of the Kingspip (trend direction) it represents a very powerful signal. In this case (GJ M15) there was a strong rejection to take the price higher, prior to the candle that printed with the two signal arrows. Price was still above DO, BRN and DP. Under these circumstances where the ASH turns red just at the close of that candle but price is obviously above DO, would you take the trade based on those powerful signals? In other words are those signals on its own, strong enough to change bias, strong enough to breach SAR? Would you consider trading this and change the trading plan by maybe reducing your risk or TP or would you just walk away? Thanks edit: red line is 10sma (not part of this system)

Hey Kubiasty, I am no expert to this system myself (noob stage) but the rules as explained by the OP are IMO quite clear. I suggest to re-read Post#1 once again and compare them against the charts you have posted. What I see when I have a look at your chart is that trading took place without taking into consideration the Welles WeldersDMI entry rules. 2uP

Yomi. I wonder...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Fxrabbi, Nice see you sharing your experience here. Was indeed nice. I wish to ask you question regarding entry. Please clarify my doubt. For example, If 5 EMA entry Arrow is painted upside and at that time price was below both MAs. THis indicates we can't take long trade. While we wait for price to cross both MAs, and we found that from Arrow Price to entry price is almost 60 Pips plus, do you still take trade that away from Arrow? Please suggest. Thanks

am I correct in saying you enter on the next 15m bar after the solid red arrow, because the solid arrow doesn't appear until the bar is closed, so you must enter after this arrow and if the two lines cross - cost me a bit today trying to get this right so far :/

Hi Fxrabbi I am requesting one explanation please. When ever the solid arrow appaears (up or down), either price is not supported by 2 MA rule or ADXr above 20 Level rule.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi guys, First of all I have to thanks to fxrabbi for sharing with us this system / strategy ... is really good and intelligent. In the beginning of this week when testing the system I lost a lot of PIPs because I was not really understand how the whole system worked. At the end of Wednesday I reviewed the rules again and began to recover very quickly all PIP's he had lost. So, I quickly realized that if I follow the rules in order and if Im not a greedy bastard (earning about 5 to 10 Pips per trade with 2% risk) very easily I make 50-100 pips in all day. We'll see if I will continue to have good results as I got this week Next week I will try to show some trades. Cheers

Once the 5ema appear, we are to enter immediately on the next candle to the candle with the 5ema, but we need to confirm with the rest rules, if they are not ready, we wait, but our waiting should not be more that particular candle - entry candle. Yomi.

Okay cheers, I may have a few go's on it next week, I have been trying to upload screenshots but for some reason it wont do anything when I upload screenshot and control + v :/ so you view the H1 timeframe, see a green arrow, then go into the 15m timeframe and if there is a green arrow you then wait for the DMI's to cross then trade is valid? also I don't have the stoch rope indicator

Hi Friends, This looks like a very good strategy. But really hard to find setups without sitting the whole day in front of pc. I'm a programmer. If you want I can help you with ea for free. Its a bit difficult to program the whole ea because of talking stochs, but it it's no problem for be to write you an EA which checks the main rules, like 5ema cross, wilders dmi rules, moving averages, currency strength and so on and only send you a email alert. So you get alarm when all rules are net and you only have to check pivot points, sort and resistance and talking stochs. If you want and if it helps I can make such ea. Kind regards Ben

Hi Yomi Awaiting for your reply on my chart. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I did not bother to comment on your chart because I did not see your entry and exit points on the chart. It seem there was no single trade on your chart because your pips counter is showing 0. There is an indicator that come with the package, which will show your trade, see post 133. Happy trading, Yomi.

Arise and repeat I noticed that you are not using the latest template, check post 1 for latest indicators and template. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I did not use your EA to take trade. I do manual entry as soon as system confirms. You can see white Lines of Sell Entry and Stopped out also mentioned as white line. That was from my real account trade and hence I need your guidance. Thanks

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Use the full package, check post 140 for what I expect to see from your charts. Read post 1 very well, and try it in demo account first. And post your charts from there I will give you the necessary assistance/guidance. Happy trading, Yomi.

Hi AllHappy, Happy new year, long time. I normally filter my selection of trades with: 1. M15 level 1 entry. 2. M15 level 2 entry. Please check post 1 for better understanding of M15 level 1 &amp; 2. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
FxRabbi, First let me say that this is a fine piece of work and I wanted to thank you for your efforts. I have a few additional questions about the EA. Let's say that you use it to place a pending order. If the order is not triggered and you want to cancel it later, which button will eliminate the order? Is the 'close Profit' only for trades that are in profit or will it close all orders? I'm also unclear about the 'Close All' button. Is it just for open trades or will it also close the pending orders? Thank you for your time and efforts.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Dear Yomi, Thanks for your quick response. ''WISH YOU A HAPPY NEW YEAR TOO + GREENER PIPS ALL THE WAY'' Best regards AllHappy. P.S. I believe with this System, I will be turning into Green from RED Account.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Yomi May I ask a question I downloaded and loaded the files in the post #1, and notice that the wukar_news indicator: There is an input on GMTOffset 3 default. But my broker time is GMT+2,must I have to change it to 2? And same thing to the EA,change too? Thanks a lot! Best wishes!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Yes, very well. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi daytrade5, How are you doing, long time. If you want to cancel pending order that was not triggered, use the script that is in the script folder that come with the trading tools in post 1, it's name is cancelPending, this will do the work for you. The "close profit" will only close all your open position in profit (green) while the "close All" will close all your open position both in negative and positive. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #162 ---

Thanks for giving out this system! I have a question about the EA: is there a way of letting it act only on its "own" trades - magic number - ? And where can one read up about this "level 1/2 entry" and its differences?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
You can read about Level 1 and 2 entry in post 1. On the EA, please leave it like that. Happy trading, Yomi.

Yomi, In Post 148 you introduce the Ichimoku. But I don't see that in your charts. Where do I have to look at the Ichimoku to give it an ok. And in your last chart you use the M5. Better than M15? Bert

--- 帖子 #185 ---
For your Ichimoku to be ok, your Ichimoku need to be green in both M15 &amp; M30 for you to go long (Buy), same thing goes with short (sell). I also look at M5 TF for my pin-point entry. Please read post 1. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #186 ---

Nice one Yomi. Thanks for sharing. Something is wrong with my chat. For example: 1. I see 2MA 2. I see DMI 3. No Trend Mirror 4. No Strength Meter 5. No 10 ema dashboard 6. No Ichimoku Kindly point me in the right direction. Thank you. JT

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I was too scared to take that one: next S1 was only 15p away and large wicks on the signal candle although not when you switch to normal candles; maybe that rule needs to be adjusted? BTW, the S/R indi has a bug: it removes any vertical line you try to put on the chart...

Please read post 1 very well, I can not see your trades on the charts. But meanwhile where you want to enter is wrong. Please don't just post any thing here. Please see attached chart for better understanding. Happy trading, Yomi.

fxrabbi, Here is my interpretation based on your rules from page 1. Moonie. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Please see attached chart for better understanding. Please read post 1 very well and study my charts. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
fxrabbi, All your chart says is "3. 5EMA and DMI Not ok". Please can you explain why. Does the green DMI have to be above the ADX like in example 1&amp;2? Moonie.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Yes, like 1 &amp; 2, but that means you did not read post 1 on DMI. please and please read post 1 if you have not done that. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I'll delete it now Yomi, but I think the instructions on page one should say "for longs, the green DMI should be above the ADX and ADXr, the opposite for shorts." Perhaps I'm the only one who finds it confusing Moonie.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
we are saying the same thing. Long: 1. DMI+ should be above 20 level. 2. DMI- should be below 20 level. 3. ADX should be between DMI+ &amp; DMI-. 4. ADXr should be above 20 level. Short: 1. DMI- should be above 20 level. 2. DMI+ should be below 20 level. 3. ADX should be between DMI- &amp; DMI+. 4. ADXr should be above 20 level. Happy trading, Yomi.

Hi Fxrabbi This is the first time I have attempted to do a reply on Forex Factory Thank you for such a well thought out system. I have success in the last week using it I do have one problem with the template on my lap top. It is fine on my desktop but I cannot take it with me when I go to my other house. Everything is jumbled on p4lClock and Ichimoku is hidden behind the AbsoluteStrengthHisto2. Also the section with close profit/buy/sell/close all is reduced in size. Hope this post works Kind regards Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
What if we see this situation on M5 but not at M15?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Yes, take it. But make sure your H1 DMI is ok, with this you are good to go. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Glad it works for you, all you need to do is to do a re-arrangement by adjusting the setting of the affected indicators. All the best. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Dear FXRabbi, do you mean DMI cross only or all DMI parametres (ADX, ADXr, 20 level)? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Not DMI cross, but all DMI parameters (DMI+, DMI-, ADX &amp; ADXr) should be ok, like your questions, shows you will do well with this trading system. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hello FXRabbi. Thank you for sharing this system. I have a question. I loaded the template from the first post but I seem to be missing one of the windows. I also keep getting a error message that cannot open file FFCal-WUKAR.ex4 Any suggestions? If is something that has already been explained, I apologize, I am still working my way through the thread. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi, you need to adjust the "x" and "y" values for those indicators to suitable values, depending on your screen resulution. Just "try and error"... edit: already answered..

First +15 on GU Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Go5, you have a very nice chart layout. Do you mind sharing the TPL? I see the EA is different also, is it something custom by you? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
A minor doubt about the ADX: since that indi only gives a value of strength to the actual trend, why would it have to be inbetween both DMI's ? One could argue that it better be in a rising slope and not too low?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Are indicators of this template repainting? I mean: can we analise past signals and make a backtest?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I use a combination of two different EA's (on 2 charts) because they permit working with a custum magic number and hence do not interfere with other trades on the same pair. Otherwise, the original one is a better solution. EA : Iv1.2 and ManualTraderv1.4 - these are on this forum. TPL: with Yomi's permission I' ll post it or send me a pm.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
ADXr has taken up that job of showing the volume of traders in the market. So ADXr must be above 20level. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thanks, yes, I see, but I was referring to the position- check of the ADX.

Good morning, Was there any special reason for waiting 4 candles after the trigger to enter the trade?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
It was when I was waiting for the strength meter to give me a go-ahead sign, it was not until the 4 candle that I got the go-ahead. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hmm, I just got stopped out on GU. Everything was aligned though. My only reasoning is that the market is too volatile right now. Looking back now I can see the "Porcupine Candles". I wont post my screenshot since it is not conforming to FXRabbi's template and he has specifically asked to not post non conforming screenshots but you should be able to see what I am talking about on the charts.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I see, so how many strenghth-points of difference do you want to see normally or do you just wait for "G =red, U=green"..?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Pleas share your system

--- 帖子 #261 ---
See post 124 to see "porcupine candles. Always make H1 DMI to be your cover over your trades. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
It could be both or one to show green/sell. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks! And on to the next question Both pairs have now breached yesterday's range (gone beyond the 100 fib-levels). So, do you treat this as a breakout if it develops nicely and keep on trading?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Second trades of the day on EURUSD total +29.7pips. Happy trading, Yomi.

Thank you FXRabbi. According to my analysis, the trade was good to go on all time frames, but I failed to recognize the porcupine candles. The market is having one of those days

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Good afternoon! Can I ask about this entry - why so late? Why not 8 M5 candles earlier? As I can see indicators at H1, M15, M5 were showing the same 1-8 candles earlier. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
You are right, you may called it change of trend/direction. Happy trading, Yomi.

FX Rabbi thanks for your system, Is there any way to set an alarm?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
hey Yomi do u offer 1-on-1 teaching Busola

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi Yomi. I don't understand why that wasn't a porcupine trade? Does it not look like the picture on post 124? Is it because there was downwards movement on the buy candle? I'm sorry for my simple questions...

--- 帖子 #275 ---
could someone pls post the current version of wellsDMI? the one at post 1 uses colors that bear no consistent relationship to the color scheme outlined in the pdf or to the ones used by most of the posters, near as i can tell; fer instance, i've got two dotted lines but i dont see that in anybody else's setup, and only one of the lines is red, etc. in the alternate, maybe update the pdf. also, since imho almost everybody uses a laptop with a 15" screen, maybe the Ichy settings (x, y) could be set up to work properly for 15" once overlayed on top of the histogram; i fiddled with it for an hour today and still can't get it to show up, so i have it as a window on its own right now. also, while i'm at it, i take it the whole stoch ribbon thing is no longer being used? and that fibs are now being used? and i notice that sometime fxrabbi makes reference to the 10 MA indicator and other times not. is that somewhat optional? somebody who has a good grasp on what's current and what's not should maybe update the pdf file. (and while there maybe give a definition for DPP and ASH, since I have no clue what they mean and you can't search on three-letter words in the thread to try to find a definition.)

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi floydd, All you need to do is use only my template and then adjust the position of the affected indicators on the screen. The pdf is the latest update, I normally update it when there is addition to the post 1. The 10ema indicator is not optional, because this makes your trades to go easily to your TP. The DPP is the Daily Pivot-Points, while the ASH is the AsoluteStrengthHisto - this is one of the indicator that make up the TrendMirror. Happy trading, Yomi.

Help yourself with updated trading tools posted in post 1, this is as a result of new settings to some indicators and introduction of trendline indicator. To your success, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
regarding a post above that you gave a thumbs up to and that i've appended below, let me ask you this. i thought the DMI+ (green) had to be above the ADX (red dotted) for a long trade to be valid. for the two trades in the pic, such is not the case. what am i missing? here's one of your earlier responses on this matter: Quoting Moonie {quote} I'll delete it now Yomi, but I think the instructions on page one should say "for longs, the green DMI should be above the ADX and ADXr, the opposite for shorts." Perhaps I'm the only one who finds it confusing Moonie. we are saying the same thing. xxxxxxxx

Hi floydd, Those trades you mentioned above were the advance method of trading this beautiful system/tool - DMI, but as soon as every body is comfortable with the basic method I will roll out the advance method, so please watch out for the advance method soon. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Trading Ideas for Trendline: I will determine how I enter trade with trendline based on momentum. i.) If I feel we have great momentum I will enter on break of the trendline. ii.) If low momentum, I will enter on close. iii.) If it's a trade I just don't like I'll wait for a pullback and then see if it has gained momentum. Above all, watch-out for where 5ema appear on the candle that break the trendline, that is where the edge is. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks for news! Do you use it at H1 (signal) only or at entry TFs?

Can someone please tell me how this works? 4. BE/Lock-in-pips = 15pips As far as I understand, when you are 15pips in black, you bring SL to BE. If that's the case, then the question is: When do you lock-in 15pips profit? I see many posters including thread owner taking profits constantly at or around 15pips and sometimes at 30pips. If your SL is at BE when you are 15pips in profit and wait for 30TP, howcome do you take profit at 15pips? Thanks in advance. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #297 ---
As I understod, simply close half of position and rest half stop lose take to BE.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
If you use the included files FXRabbi provided, and you use his template, you will see that it includes his EA that he uses to manage the trades. The EA is only used to manually open trades with the button coded into the EA, and the EA sets SL, TP, and trail levels according to the settings. The settings in the EA included in the template have the settings "Lock in points: 150" and "Activate Lock in Points after X points in Profit: 170" This means that the EA will essentially move the SL to 15 pips after the trade reaches 17 pips profit, and keep TP at 30 pips. So if trade reaches 17 pips, then retraces only 2 pips to 15, the trade is closed at +15 pips. This is why most of the trades you will see here are 15 pips TP, and only some are at 30 pips. Hope I was able to answer your question. Happy weekend guys!

btw / what's supposed to show up when you use fxR's template? all i get are the HA bars, the two MAs, and his EA. that the way it's supposed to be?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
No

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Yes, correct.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
All TF's.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Use my template, all my settings are there. And be careful so that I will not put you on my ignore list, so follow simple instructions. Yomi.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
ah, just realized what my malfunction was. i'd put all your indicators in a folder under the indicators folder, which made it so your template couldn't find the indicators, eventhough you can find em through navigator. so, i moved em all to the indicators folder and all is well. sorry to have cluttered up the thread so badly. i will remove myself to the penalty box for a while, in penance.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks mate. Appreciate it. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Yomi, I've been reading this thread with great interest. Thanks for sharing. I have a question re. your second trade on above chart. You said " ADX must be above one of the DMI's" and to explain it better you later said "ADX should be between DMI+ &amp; DMI-" Your second trade on above chart shows ADX is above both DMIs, not between them. Isn't it more correct to restate ADX rule as: "ADX should be either between DMI+ and DMI- OR above both" Thanks in advance. Regards, Blackeagle

5 questions to ask yourself before opening a live/real forex account: 1. Have you been trading on a regular basis for six months or longer. 2. Have you experimented with trading different styles. 3. Are your winning trades outweighing your losing trades over a long term. 4. Do you have a process for recording and reviewing your trades to improve performance. 5. Have you developed a trading plan and process that works for you. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Yomi, Thanks for the reply. Just another question. You said we needed to check H1 DMI before taking a trade. Do we need to look at only DMI on H1 to see everything in place or do you also check price on H1 being above/below 2 MAs and DPP? Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Both, I will give out the checklist very soon. I always like your questions, they are good for everybody here. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
CHECKLIST: 1. H1 - Direction: i.) Price vs the 2 MA's/DPP. ii.) DMI - DMI's vs ADX &amp; ADXr. iii.) TrendMirror - the 2 indicators must be in agreement up to 1 bar. 2. M15 &amp; M5 - Entry: i.) 5ema - the trigger. ii.) Price vs the 2 MA's/DPP. a.) 24/72 MA = Buy. b.) 72/24 MA = Sell. iii.) 10ema dashboard - minimum of M15 - H1. iv.) Strength meter. v.) Ichimoku - minimum of M15 - M30. vi.) DMI - should be ok. vii.) TrendMirror. a.) Level 1 entry. b.) Level 2 entry. viii.) News indicator - should give you go ahead. Happy trading, Yomi.

1st trade of the week: EURUSD (M5) +14.4pips. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thank you for new rules resume. No word about trend lines on main screen?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Congrats! I have been waiting for a setup but did not get one . ADXR was (is) under water all morning on M15 and the Strength meter never got into any color... Would you mind go through your criteria for this trade? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
A couple of objections re. validity of that trade. 1- ADXr was below 20 2- ADX was below both DMIs Please correct me if I'm wrong Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Very busy right now, but will do that later in the day, always like your questions too, this will help every body here. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Will do that later, my friend, busy right now. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I think the trade is correct becoz there was a 5ema trigger, currency meter and histogram was color red, DMI- was above the ADX, and the PA came from between the 2 MAs. So there were 4 confluences of events to have a high probability trade. Am I correct in my observation....

--- 帖子 #320 ---
No, you are not correct if you read post #1. It clearly states that; 2. DMI: - Window 1 iii.) ADXr must be above 20 level. and When not to trade: 1. When ADX is below both DMI lines or ADXr is below 20 level. But since Yomi said he/she would explain it later, we need to wait for the explanation. As Go5 noticed, too, (he/she is more experienced on this strategy than me), the above trade is not valid with CURRENT rules. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Will be back soon. Happy trading, Yomi.

There is a script that comes with this trading system, check post 1, it name is 111_ObjectsDeleteAll. Drag it into your chart or double click it on your chart, then save it into your template, it will do the work. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Sorry for the late reply to your request. This is it: This trade was back up with H1. The H1 was back up with the advance method of trading DMI which I will try to teach next week, but I want every one to get on well with the basic method. Normally when H1 is fine, I can do anything in lower TF especially M5, if the following are ok: i.) 5ema - the trigger. ii.) 72/24 MA - sell. iii.) Strength. iv.) TrendMirror. Hope this help, Yomi. NB: I'm still very busy to do a details write-up on the topic, but I will do more on the advance method of this trading method by next week. Go5, please take note.

First trade today: GU +15 I entered when price cut through the ichimoku cloud on M15 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Took that one too Go5, but I was able to get in a little earlier. Nice trade.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
The learning never stops! Thank you fxrabbi

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Go5: Looks to me like when you took your trade, DMI- was below ADXr and possibly ADX. I thought it had to be above both? If this is an advanced-method trade, it might be good to label it as such, so novices like myself don't get confused. OTOH, if you had waited, the trade would not have worked.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Note taken, Thanks.!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
We don't have a rule about DMI to ADXr position here, as far as I know at least. All was OK, except for the ichimoku value (not red yet just before the trade) and it was also a bit late regarding the time-window (after 12:00GMT), but since we had some red news before I tought I use some of the "afterglow" of the market movements... ...and the "trade" would still be on so far

--- 帖子 #342 ---
thanks for the speedy response. thought DMI had to be greater than ADXr but maybe I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
You might need to study the rules carefully - this has not been mentioned anywhere .

at the risk of incuring yomi's wrath, here's his response to an earlier post: Quoting Moonie {quote} I'll delete it now Yomi, but I think the instructions on page one should say "for longs, the green DMI should be above the ADX and ADXr, the opposite for shorts." Perhaps I'm the only one who finds it confusing Moonie. we are saying the same thing. ----------------------------- it would seem i am not the only one who is confused.

Your strength histogram was still "half" red..??

Hi Go5, I put more emphasis on the position of the DMI's and the upturned ADX rather than the histogram. Just my personal preference. Moonie.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hmmm... SL Ichimoku and arjun were red and all other parameters were to sell, but...

--- 帖子 #361 ---
BUT.... H1 was not supporting your buy decision, the price was below DPP on M5, ADX was below both DMIs on M5 etc. etc. Looks like you need to reread all the rules. Hope this was demo. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Whenever you want to do your sell, make sure your 24 MA is under 72 MA and also make sure you are guided with H1, please check my write-up on checklist. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Ok, thanks. But what's the problem now?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Where is your trigger - 5ema (arrow). There are so many wrongs in your trade. Your H1 is not ready. Happy trading, Yomi.

I was able to load it. I have two questions: which is the DPP on the chart ... the purple bell? Also, I have a Oanda demo account and just to see if the buttons worked I tried to press the EA buttons and nothing happened...

--- 帖子 #367 ---
You are right on the DPP and the EA is off, check the attached chart on how to put it ON. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thank You Yomi! The buttons don't work but I haven't placed an order on this version of mt4 before. Maybe that's why? Like... how would I control the amount and leverage and stuff? Thank you so much for your help!

Moonie, no offense intended, but your kind of posts are what make me so reluctant to share strategies on FF. With all the trouble Yomi has gone to explaining and detailing conditions needed to be satisfied before taking any trade, why on earth would you still take that SELL trade ON AU??? It will be frustrating to the thread starter if you keep posting these type of setups that are not according to clearly laid down rules.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
LiteChild, Kindly point out why the AU was not a good setup. Before you mention ichimoku and the dashboard, these were all red when I took the trade. Moonie.

VERY nice late morning today! Thanks fxRabbi!

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hello FXRabbi. would you consider also posting any failed trades that you have personally taken? I ask because I think its important to get a whole picture of what this system can and can't do. Nothing is perfect, we all know that. It will help those that are taking bad trades see what a trade gone wrong looks like as well when taken by the system. Just a humble request. Thanks and pips for all!!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Yomi let me ask you this quick question. Do you normally just monitor a 5m chart for your trades or do you use EMA crosses on H1 to get your attention as to a trade?

--- 帖子 #386 ---

Once the H1 is ok, I then look forward to M5 &amp; M15 for trigger + other conditions. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I can't get the EA to work, but maybe because I havent traded on my mq4 yet. How does the EA know how big to make the trade etc. Because I'm thinking if I'd make a trade before then the EA would just do that? Or are there defaults? I think if I answer that question I'll be able to figure out why it won't trade. Thanks everyone!

Maybe the error is on my side, but it looks like your wukar-news is no set correctly: red news at 17:00 CET so that was red when you put the trade..??

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Go5, When I took the trade, the TrendMirror was red and I don't think there was anything on the wukar-news. Can I just ask, what is the difference between red and green on the wukar-news? Moonie.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
At the first red bar, you' re 1 hour away from red news. ...but only if you set your broker offset right...

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Ah right, my MT4 is 2 hrs ahead of me (i'm in the UK). I watch the red news on FF home page so not too worried about that. Thanks Go5. Moonie.

I got stoped out 3 times this morning at London Open. Not sure if its part of your rules, but I think its a time that should be avoided. On hindsight, I could have avoided a loss on EU by heeding the Trend Mirror. Other then that and avoiding LO, what can I learn from these bad trades? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #415 ---
You traded the Frankfurt Fakes, better wait 30 min or so...

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Your EURUSD trade is against the rules as ADXr was below 20 and the price was above DPP when you took the short trade. The lesson you should learn is that you should not trade without knowing the rules by heart. You state " Not sure if its part of your rules ". The question is: why do you trade a system before learning it. Hope this helps. Regards, Blackeagle

Your DMI is not looking good at all, look at your ADX.... Happy trading, Yomi.

Afraid not Neo, I played around with the settings and changed the order of the indicators but no luck. I've reverted back to the old template until a solution is found. Cheers Moonie.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
See, thank you!!!!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yes, I agree that the EU was a bad call, but what about the rest of the trades? Can you point out what was wrong with them? When I say "Not sure" is because he hasnt mentioned it until now. It was a statement meant more along the lines of "Im going to avoid LO".

--- 帖子 #428 ---
2 things that might help. First use HA candles. They help a lot with this system. Second you weren't trading LO. You traded BEFORE LO in which you learned a valuable lesson about when to trade this system. I personally never trade during Frankfurt because they do stop hunts a lot like this morning. Price shot up at LO and then continued its original direction.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Neo, thank you for your answer. I really did take away from these trades in reference to the Frankfurt time. Avoid it as you do. Thank you. I dont have the HA on my charts simply because I like to see the exact closing and opening prices of the candles the signals are given on. HA can sometimes be a little deceiving in that regard. Either way, price flows the same way. But why do you think HA is such a great benefit to the system? Is it the less stress inducing aspect of HA? Thanks again Neo

--- 帖子 #430 ---
This is the way mine is set moonie and it works fine. http://screencast.com/t/LFt7XXh7HYV4

--- 帖子 #431 ---
When using HA, set the candles to bar-type with good contrast color - you'll see most of the open &amp; close..

--- 帖子 #432 ---
hello, i have downloaded the templates&amp;indicators, but so far i miss the talking stochs and the DMI . my charts look like this. does anybody know how i can fix this problem? thx in advance!

Some indicators are missing, check very well, and do the needful. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
i got it. thx yomi, and all a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I have always like HA for smoothing out PA and it seems to lend well with this system. I believe that's why Yomi added it back when. One tip I have found. Don't trade Guppy from M5. It just has way too much movement and too many false signals. 15m works much better with that pair.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
are talking stochs still part of the plan? it seemed to me they'd hit the dust bin.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I want a simple and effective system, so the stochs has no part to play again. Happy weekend, Yomi.

ok, so riddle me this? are you trading off the 5 min chart and using no higher time frames? that's the only way i can see deciding to take the trade. from what i can tell, once you go up the TFs even to 15m, DMI is not at all in proper orientation to back up the trade. what am i missing here?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
What are the TF for the 10ema dashboard And I just want to make sure... they all have to be pointing in the direction of the trade, right?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Check post 1 for updated pdf. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
THanks. It says "iii.) 10ema dashboard - minimum of M15 - H1." The first arrow is m1 and the second is m5 or the first is m5 and the secon is m15?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
The idea Floyyd is to use H1 first for an alert from the MA breakout indi then make sure the MA's are in correct alignment, that DMI is showing a good trend and that trendmirror is correct. Then you go to either m5 or m15 to find entry based upon rules.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
M15 to H1 and yes. You want them pointing the direction of the trade.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
What I meant was what are the values for the five arrows and do we need each of the five arrows pionting up or just m15 and h1? Thanks neo.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I think m15, m30, and h1 must be all pointing in the direction of the trade.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
maybe that's what he did and certainly price was below the two on-screen MAs and trendmirror was correct on the H1, but the ADX part of the DMI was well below the 20 line, never mind also being below *both* DMIs, so I think I can say DMI was *not* showing a good trend (eventhough ADXr was in a good place). i dunno but i sure would like someone to post a trade in real time, so we can see just how one example unfolds in real time. i mean, i can always find some kind of logic for a trade in hindsight but at the moment, in the moment -- well, i for one would like to see it.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Floydd , Yomi takes trades based upon advanced ADX strategies that he hasn't shown you yet. You should be focusing on following the checklist for trades until it is second nature. The system is very easy to follow and the rules really make it so you cant make a mistake if you follow them.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Yes, you are right

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #453 ---
For your H1 to be ok, means: Sell: 1. DMI- should be above 20level. 2. DMI+ should be below 20level. 3. ADX should be in-between one of the DMI's. 4. ADXr should be above 20level. 5. Price should be below the 2 MA's/DPP. 6. TrendMirror: ok - minimum of 1 bar should be in agreement. Buy: 1. DMI+ should be above 20level. 2. DMI- should be below 20level. 3. ADX should be in-between one of the DMI's. 4. ADXr should be above 20level. 5. Price should be above the 2 MA's/DPP. 6. TrendMirror: ok - minimum of 1 bar should be in agreement. Then after you can start looking for trades on M5 TF &amp; M15 TF. Please, make the checklist your second nature if you are to be successful with this simple and effective trading system. Happy trading, Yomi.

agreed, of course, but it would be *very* helpful is when folks post charts, they also post whether it's an advanced trade or a basic one -- either an A trade or a B trade. without that, how is one to know? if charts are posted to help others learn from, how can we learn if we don't know whether the trade follows the checklist, as stated, or some other checklist as yet unstated? certainly, the trade i originally referred to does not follow the rules above.

Hey Yomi and Moonie I see you guys clicked "Sell" on the EA to take the trade. What happens if you guys had clicked "Sell .50/.100" on the EA instead ? Thank you for your anticipated answer.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
That mean you are entry the market via a pending order - sell stop. This will place your trades at .50/.100 level, e.g 1.42150 and 1.42200. Happy trading, Yomi.

I think that the indicator is not working properly,, because it is assumed that the arrows appear when the bar closes above or below the average of 5, and many times that is true right cross but the indicator does not put the arrow.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
No, the arrow will only appear when its crosses any candle. You can cross-check this by applying moving average 5 - shift 2- exponential- close. Do this and give me feedback later. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Sorry Yomi, my English is disastrous, and there are some concepts that just do not understand .. in this example, I put the 5 EMA Shift 2 close. A red arrow should appear not ?. Regards

Hi, nice system and nice thread, congratulations! As I was studying the rules of the system, I noticed that the "Price MA Breakout" indicator seems to miss some crossovers and doesn't show an arrow. See the example in the attached image, where the yellow circle is (EMA 5 of close with shift 2 in orange). Attached Image I looked at the mq4 code and made some changes that correct the issue.

My first trade with this system. EU to TP (+11.9 pip). I reduced the TP to gain confidence... it was supposed to be 15 pips but I messed up the EA configs. Any comments appreciated to help me correct errors. One question: Sometimes the EMA gives the trigger signal but the DMI is not ready. How many bars can we wait for the DMI to be ready after the EMA signal? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #530 ---
This is an excellent trade, arise and repeat, hope you are aware that you should use H1 as your guide for direction Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Thanks. Yes, I printed the instructions and checklist and have it nearby

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Yomi Thank you for sharing this excellent method. I have attached a EU H1 chart. Can you please point out which is the entry candle. To determine the H1 direction the ADX should be between -DMI &amp; +DMI on the close of H1 candle. I have attached the values of ADX etc. In your recent GU chart the ADX value is higher and do not fall between the -DMI &amp; +DMI Is it complusory or can be avoided. Thank you &amp; God bless

--- 帖子 #534 ---
EJ to TP (15M) : +15.6 pips I think it wasn't a perfect entry because I was too early. Didn't let the bar close to confirm the EMA crossing. Also the ASH and maybe the DMI were not ready... Still I got lucky. Must be more careful. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Cheers Yomi, me too.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I mean ADX should be between -DMI &amp; +DMI on hourly What about that?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
New update pdf posted in post 1. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
There is no particular candle that determine my entry in H1 TF, All I look for in H1 TF is the followings: 1. Where is the price in relationship to: i.) The 2 MA's. ii.) DPP. 2. DMI - DMI's vs ADX &amp; ADXr - must be in proper orientation to back up the trade. 3. TrendMirror - the 2 indicators must be in agreement up to minimum of 1 bar. After I am satisfied with the above 3 factors, I now start to expect 5ema - the trigger in M5 or M15 TFs..... Please check post 1, where I wrote the full details on checklist . Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Yes, that ADX rule is a bit of a puzzle to me and I mentioned that earlier in the thread: if you have a strong trend, the ADX(r) can stay above both DMI's for hours, like 2 days ago when I posted a +21 on EU, it stayed there for 5 hours or so and you could have entered a couple of times down the hill. On the other hand, if the ADX goes over 50 or so a retrace might be close... Maybe Jomi can say a little bit more on this.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Yes this is the second stage - advance stage of trading this system, but I am not yet ready to let it out until the majority of the followers of this system get used to the basic method, but for the fact that you are one of the good traders of this system I will only say few things here. When ADX is above the two DMI ( DMI- &amp; DMI+ ) and is above ADXr too or cross ADXr from below and stay above the ADXr you are good to go as well - take it to be ok, but when ADX cross ADXr from above and stay below ADXr, this is the time not to trade. The crossing of ADX and ADXr is a trading signal on its own. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks, makes sense! In the meantime, I'll try to only post standard trades.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
For the third point, did you mean we must open at the second bar of TrendMirror? I have 2 quetions, please help me: 1. I still don't understand how to use the ichimoku, sometimes it shows negative/positive numeral sometimes no. What it means? 2. Are we still be able to open postion if we late of the trend? if yes, what are the conditions based?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Like you, I'm still learning the system. However looking at your chart, I would have waited for ADXr (red dots) to move above the 20level. Also, I can't see any Fibonacci Retracement on your chart (Yomi says on pg.1 - not to take the signals which are beyond 78.6) See trading rules and checklist from Yomi on pg.1

Hi Yomi; I have a doubt; When all the checklist is OK, your entry in M5 / M15 .... Do you wait at close the bar, a market order, or the next level of 05/10? Cheers

Last trade of yesterday: GBPJPY to SL (15M) with half the risk (1%) Errors made: probably the entry was too low relative to the last pivot high. The stop loss was too narrow... must find a way to adapt the SL and PT to the pair volatility, especially when trading other pairs. Also I had already 2 winning trades and should have stopped for the day. Still, very happy to have ended the first day with around 2.5% profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) first trade of today: GBPCAD to PT (15M) : +33.8 pips closed manually since the EA wasn't closing at PT.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I don't save a pic at oppening, only after the trade is closed... But you can see how the DMI window was at the oppening bar. Basicaly you want to see a strong trend measured by the ADX (red dotted) and ADXR (yellow) and you also want the DMI+ (red) and DMI-(green) crossed in the correct way. All systems are discretionary to some degree, where you understand the logic of the system and choose only the best trade candidates. This system looks for strong trends in the higher time-frame (1H) and trades the corrections against that trend. It's necessary to gain experience and learn from the mistakes in order to be able to identify the best opportunities and let the not so good ones pass (something I'm trying to learn just now). Jaime

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi Moonie, I'll give you my prespective on your trade. Besides following all the rules, you must also understand what the system tries to accomplish, it's philosophy. And this system trades corrections against the main trend. So you must look for a clear correction in the main trend, looking at the 15M chart. That's the situation where the best opportunities occur. If you look at your chart there is no clear correction. When you don't have a correction against the main trend, price can still continue to go in the direction of the trend but, a reversal is much more likely, as was the case in your trade. You must put all the factors in your favor: strong trend + mild correction + probable resume of trend + no news + no support/resistence levels ahead + etc. Jaime

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Excellent advice Jaime, I'll add this to my checklist. Many thanks Moonie.

Yes, I trade only this system. The 00 level trading system (EsikeM30Bomb) is a system that gives you the desired discipline required to survival this market. But, EsikeA+++ is the most simple and effective system that I can recommend to any serious traders. Happy trading, Yomi.

I don't trade this pair, but when I check the H1 of this pair, the DMI is not ok. 1. Basic: ADX should be in between the DMI's. 2 . Advance: ADX should be above ADXr or cross ADXr from below. Please, and please if your H1 - DMI is not ok and Price in relationship to the 2 MA's/DPP are not ok, Please don't trade that pair, and don't bother to post it to this thread, otherwise, I will put that trader on my ignore lists. See the attached chart, you will discover that EURCAD H1 did not support your trade. Please follow the trading rules of this system if you want to continue to post to this thread. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Well in my opinion you should remove the statement where you say it will work on any pair, state clearly that this method is only to be traded on EUR/USD and GBP/USD

--- 帖子 #572 ---
But, if you read my post 570 very well, I never say you should not trade EURCAD. I only recommend that he should follow H1 DMI as guide for his trade, and that me, don't trade EURCAD, doesn't mean I said he shouldn't trade EURCAD. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi Yomi, I'm making many mistakes so I reread all the rules, checklists and took another look at the charts. I'm also doing my personal checklist to help me improve. I know it's a pain to keep explaining things but I'm going to ask some questions about some points that are not clear to me. When you have some free time please give me your feedback. 1) As I understood, in Level 1 entry, the PriceToOpen is already good and then ASH aligns. We must wait for the close of that bar where the ASH changes and enter in the open of the next bar. Correct? 2) As for Level 2 entry, both PriceToOpen and ASH are already aligned (it's a small pullback so they don't change color). Then there is a pullback bar (15M) which must close with a different color. In the next bar we would enter on the break of the low/high of the pullback bar? Another doubt: if we have more than 1 pullback bars without ASH changing color, is the Level 2 entry still valid? and where should we enter? 3) In the H1 graph you say the TrendMirror indicators must agree up to 1 bar. Does that mean that they can't agree for more than 1 bar? Sometimes the pullback is weak and there is no color change in the H1 graph. 4) This system has 2 triggers, the EMA5 and the Entry levels 1&amp;2 and sometimes they don't trigger in the same bar. How should we manage the two? Usually the EMA triggers first. For example, should we enter in the bar after the EMA signal if ASH changes in the middle of the bar (not closed)? And if ASH doesn't change in the following bar, do we keep waiting? Sorry for all the questions. I'm sure the anwsers will help other too. Thanks. Jaime

Hi Sandico68, When you took this trade the value of ADXR in H1 was only 17.9 Is it ok ??? I was also watching this trade and did not take it because of low ADXR value. Maybe Yomi can be more specific. Thanks

Correct Fistus. Moonie.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
1. yes. 2. (a): Yes. (b): Yes, still valid. (c): 5ema should be able to show you where to enter. 3. Minimum of 1 bar, which mean it can be more than 1 bar. 4. This system has only one (1) trigger, which is the 5ema. The trendmirror (level 1&amp;2) only act as filter to this trading system. I hope this answer all your questions, if not, please let me know.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
OK, I wish you a happy weekend! Jaime

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I thought that in the "later edition of the rules" the trigger is auto-ploted trend line break after 5ema cross. Isn't it so? Like in this your trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trendline is not a filter here, right? Because you didn't filter triggers (MAcross) signal above it and didn't wait for new trigger below it. As I can see, you: 1. waited for arrow 2. waited for breaking local trendline 3. took the trade

--- 帖子 #590 ---
The only trigger to this trading system is 5ema - AKA - the trigger. Trendline is a plus to this system especially if the candle that break the trendline happen to be the candle that has the 5ema - the trigger. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Dear Yomi, I did change to the latest edition as per post 1. I checked my Wilders settings and it shows 1,14,14,8 But to my surprise it is still showing 17.9 Could it be because of different broker. My GMT offset is set to +8. This will surely affect my trade entry. Can something be done. Thank you

5 ways to persevere in your trading: "Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is courage to continue that counts" - Sir Winston Churchill. 1. Identify your "compelling reason" or purpose for trading. 2. Remember that successful traders are not born, they are developed. 3. Cultivate curiosity. 4. Develop joy in doing the "right thing" in your trading. 5. Never give up and never give in: don't quit. Happy trading, Yomi.

1st trade of the week/day: EURUSD +14.6pips. Trade Idea: 1. 5ema - the trigger. 2. Price below the 2 MA's. 3. Strength - weak EUR. 4. 10ema dashboard - ok. 5. DMI - advance method. 6. TrendMirror - ok. 7. Ichimoku - ok. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Took the same! Thanks again for your ideas! fxRabbi, may I ask as a non-mql-programmer? Can you upgrade dash with some trailing stop options? Or do you think it's not compatible with your system? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Good for you too You are right to some extend, but you see, I'm a discipline trader, I always go for my daily target, and once I reached my daily target, I normally stop for the day, so I don't believe in trailing stop. I knew 15pips should be ok for the day. I don't mind/care leaving some pips on the table. Happy trading, Yomi.

Now That was an entry

--- 帖子 #605 ---
okay, i think i'm beginning to get it. you follow the rules unless you don't follow the rules (like never mind adx isn't b/ dmi+, dmi-) and then you call it advanced. plus, you can draw trendlines that make it all make sense in hindsight. my only question is, why don't you post only real time trades, like for a week straight, so that we can see how this unfolds in real time?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Thank you for the anwsers, Yomi! Green Pips!

iTS NOT BAD BEGINNING FOR THE WEEK EURUSD-M5 +7.3PIPS Happy trading fxbiddy

--- 帖子 #608 ---
I take it you closed this trade manually ​

--- 帖子 #609 ---
yes , you are correct, it was manually operated with my little experience tanks fxbiddy

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Thank you, my Brother Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I can not post real time trades here because I don't do " trades call " here and I don't " spoon feed " here. I gained my experience here through studying of experienced traders for many years via their entry and exit points on their post, day and night, it seem you are not ready to learn, and I think this is your last post here, bye. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Please I don't like people posting different indicators here on my thread, this confused the newbies. Any traders that post his/her trades here with template/indicators that is different from my template/indicators in post 1, will be put on my ignore list. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
OK Yomi, sorry about that. I deleted my post. My previous post with an indicator I believe cannot be deleted anymore. Jaime.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Thank you

Hi All, I created an expert advisor that gives you an alert when adxr, adx, mi+, mi- are ok on chosen times on a given list of symbols according to the rules. If you read the rules, it does not check for all of them. Just those which are related adxr, adx, mi, mi. It can used a prefilter. It also uses another way to calculate adxr, adx, mi, mi which may be similar or different to the way it is calculated by the official template. That needs to be verified. You attach it to a chart, then you will see.. The naming of the parameters should be clear. [removed advisor, fxrabbi did not find it useful enough]

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Please read post 613. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
So do you find it different?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I did not even bother to check it, because I don't trade more than 2 currency pairs, and the DMI has a lot of trading signals/ideas which no EA can ever cover, is like you are short changing yourself. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Well, let me try last time. It is a prefilter which means it could reduce the amount of work one has to do to notice something is happening. It is not instead of your indicators, it is next to them. It contains the two rules you mentioned, that I found it in this thread. You can still look at the indicators you provided. Let us assume you have two symbols. and you check m15,m30,h1. So you keep checking every 15 minutes. That is 3*2*4= 24 looks are spared per hour. (if it works properly). I have another practical problem the charts below 1h, freeze extremely. The response rate goes down 30s per click. The frustation in itself. If you do not fix that, using the method is not practical for me. Your word is last.. After hearing this, so should I remove it?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
My position is that I want this system to be very simple with minimal indicators and The DMI contains a lots of trading signals which no EA can replace. I will prefer we trade with the basic files on post 1 in order not to confused the newbies, and to make the system simple and unique. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
HI All, I have repeated problem that the template provided has locked up my Metatrader. I found that it is caused wuker news indicator, after its removal, everything is fast.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Why great traders specialize: * In any field, whether it's business, athletics or the arts, the person that masters his or her specialized craft is usually looked upon as the "best" as one of the best at what they do. * In the world of trading financial markets this especially holds true. I see too many new traders continuously searching for the Holy Grail in different technical indicators, asset classes and strategies, which is fine when one is starting out. However, there comes a time when one must declare a major. * One of the hallmarks of highly successful traders is that they have a specialty. These folks have a specific strategy or set of strategies that they have mastered and apply consistently, day in and day out. *There are two schools of thought on this: + One is mastering a technique and scanning the entire universe of asset classes specific setups; + The other is focusing on a specific sector, asset class or market. * I encourage everyone to find a specialty in the markets, whether it be a certain type of market or trading style suited for daily, weekly, or monthly income. Once that's established, create a simple set of trading rules to achieve those goals that make you feel successful. *This is what trading made possible with EsikeA+++ has done or covered. Happy trading, Yomi.

Hi Traders, Just trying out this method,hope im on the right track, if not pls kindly advice me, GBP pairs triggers during news. TIA

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Weldone for the effort! I have not seen any trade in GBPUSD today according to H1 TF. H1 has not given any signal to go yet. Always use your H1 as a guide before taking any trade, if H1 is not good, that's mean no trade. Please read post 1 every well , it seem you have not yet read post 1 very well. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Dear Yomi ... Do you mean that you look at the H1 trend to enter trades? If H1 downtrend you will only enter trade on 15M Sell trade? If 15M give Buy trade wont you enter trade as oppose to H1 trend? Thanks

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Sir, This is great sharing with trading manual, hwever installation is missing and newbie like us could mistaken in installation on both H1 and M15, M5, etc. Hence please kindly share the step by step installation as manual would be very helpful. In addition, I can see 4 component here as EA, Indicators, Scripts, template. Since this is manual trading style do we still need to attach the EA as well? Please kindly guide steps. Really appreciate ...

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hi mmswe, 1. Yes, you need to look at H1 before you takes your trades. 2. Yes, if H1 is showing downtrend, you only enter sell in M5/M15 TF. 3. If M5/M15 gives buy setup while H1 is showing downtrend, I will NOT enter the trade. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Ok, I will see to that. But, you need to attach the EA as well. Please read through the whole thread and read about the EA and how its works, there was a post I wrote about the EA. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Thanks very much for clarification. In this case do I have to set chart template to both timeframe? What is the EA and script do with trades in this system? When I attach the EA to chart it just appearing some buy sell close all of button on chart? Please elaborate further. Sorry ..

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I may not be able to attend to you now, because I am very busy right now, I will get back to you later, but meanwhile you can read the whole thread, your answer may likely be there. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Sure thanks I understand this is your trading hour .. Good luck with your trading...

--- 帖子 #637 ---
First trade I moved my SL too soon, feared a fake move, second went to +15. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I didnt take it because ADX was descending under ADXr on H1. Seemed risky.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Weldone, good observation and very vital too.

Could you please screen capture of the WIndow to see example and understand from you?

GBPUSD (M5) +14.4pips. Trade Idea: 1. 5ema - the trigger. 2. Price above the 2 MA's/DPP. 3.10ema dashboard - ok. 4. Strength meter - very ok. 5. DMI - dancing to my music. 6. DMI's H1 - ok 7. Ichimoku - ok. 8. Trendmirror - ok. 9. MACD - ok. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
...Wait, what's that with the MACD, new rule?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Is an old stuff which I thought will compliment this trading system, because it let you see: 1. good/strong trend. 2. pullback/retracement period. 3. continuation of the main trend. And that is also the main thrust of this beautiful trading system. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
New update in post 1. This contains: 1. new pdf. 2. MACD - check post 641 - 643 for details. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi Yomi, Good to see that you are still teaching. Lost you for a while, did not realize you started a new thread but glad I found it. Will be learning . Thank you very much. Cheers

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Macd What for? Just an oscilator showing right the same as your MAs show. Giving less info about trend then DMI. FXRabbi, if I can "ask" in your trend, please, keep your system easy. I still think and work with you.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
My good old friend from 00 level trading, very long time, how are you doing with your trading. Nice hearing from you again, this thread is for traders like you, who are ready to learn and make money from forex trading. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
This addition is optional, that is why I did not update the template in post 1, but trust me I will never add any addition to the system if it does not add value/edge to it. It unlock the key to this great system. Check post 1 on MACD (this is not an ordinary MACD, it's a special MACD), you will enjoy it. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
May I know the link from where to download the macd...? Tnx

Fibonacci Retracements: The Talking Points: * Why Fibonacci retracement: i.) This system (trading made possible with EsikeA+++) is a trend following system. ii.) Trend is your friend. iii.) Trend following is the best way to make money in the market. iv.) Follow the trend and never look back. v.) Fibonacci works great on the trending markets. * Fibonacci ratios/standard levels: i.) 23.6%. ii.) 38.2%. iii.) 50.0%. iv.) 61.8%. v.) 78.6%. vi.) 100.0% vii.) 1.382%. viii.) 1.618%. * The Fibonacci Retracement tool shows four common retracements: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50.0%, and 61.8%. It is clear that 23.6%, 38.2%, and 61.8% stem from ratios found within the Fibonacci sequence. The 50.0% retracement is not based on Fibonacci number. Instead, this number stems from Dow Theory's assertion that the averages often retrace half their prior move. * Based on depth, we can consider a 23.6% retracement to be relatively shallow. such retracements would be appropriate for flags or short pullbacks. * Retracements in the 38.2% - 50.0% range would be considered moderate. * Even through deeper, the 61.8% retracement can be referred to as the golden retracement. It is, after all, based on the Golden Ratio. * Fibonacci retracements are often used to identify the end of a correction or a counter-trend bounce. Corrections and counter-trend bounces often retrace a portion of the prior move. While 23.6% retracements do occur, the 38.2% - 61.8% covers the more possibilities (with 50.0% in the middle). This z one may seem big, but it is just a reversal alert z one. * The 3 most important Fibonacci levels: i.) 38.2%. ii.) 50.0%. iii.) 61.8%. * 38.2%, 50.0%, and 61.8% retracements form the primary pullback levels. * Fibonacci ratio describe the interaction between trend and count-trend markets. * So, remember our trading rule No.5, which says: " Use Fibonacci Retracement and do not take the signals which are beyond 78.6%". Happy trading week ahead, Yomi.

Money Management: The Talking Points: 1. MM =2%. 2. TP = 30pips. 3. SL = 15pips. 4. BE/Lock-in-pips = 15pips. 5. Daily Target = 30pips. 6. Stop trading after reaching daily target. 7. Stop trading after 3 consecutive losses. * Without good money management you cannot be successful in trading. Your money management plan does not have to be very complicated, but you should follow some basic rules. * Money management is very important. In my opinion, it is as important as your trading system. You may be a great trader, but without good money management, you are still going to fail. What does good money management mean. It means that you do not risk too much of your money and even after a lost trade you still have money to trade and build your wealth/capital/balance. * It is not enough to decide that you are not going to take riskly trades. You are not able to switch off emotions completely. And where there are emotions, there are also mistakes. That is why you need a good plan. The best way is to write it down and correct when necessary. This plan should contain several positions: i.) Your trading account size. ii.) Maximum risk. iii.) Where you place stops. iv.) When you take profit. v.) Number of lost trades you stop trading after. * I have done the above for you, check my post 1 on money/trade management. Happy trading week ahead, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi Fxrabbi, I would be interested in the following number: (the sum of all your profits using this method/ the sum of all losses usign this method) What do you get if you calculate it? and over what period?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
I am not selling anything here and I don't intend to do that in the future, All I do here is free. Do that for yourself and then decide if you want to follow this great system or you want to move on. After all I post my trades here on daily basis. Happy trading week ahead, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Bless you Yomi I'm loving the system so far. The H1 filter will really keep me from taking trades before trend really starts which is one of the major problem I was having. I've been back testing the criterias you've set and they are working out well so far. One question is Pivots, do you still respect them when entering your trades? Thank you as usual

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Dear Yomi, Hope you had a good weekend. I would like to request those 9 points criteria which give you entry be label on the chart so we beginners could understand how to enter and exit efficiently. Thanks ...

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Bless you too. " The H1 filter will really keep me from taking trades before trend really starts which is one of the major problem I was having" . - Thank God you know this. Yes, this system will take of that problem. * Pivot - points - Yes, I still observes them. i.) price below DPP = sell. ii.) Price above DPP = buy. iii.) S1 &amp; R1 = caution, when price is less 10pips to reach them. iv.) S3 &amp; R3 = caution, no more trades near them for the day. NB: All you need for this system is in post 1. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hope this will help, if you need further help, pls let me know. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
hi, i have trouble understanding this condition: " 3. ADX should be in-between one of the DMI's. " i think it means " +DI &gt; ADX &gt; -DI " for bullish trade &amp; " +DI &lt; ADX &lt; -DI " for bearish trade. Right? please someone correct me if i'm wrong. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Read, sleep, and run some errand for my wife.... Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Great addition to the system Yomi. To those just starting with this system the greatest thing about it is that it will keep you from trading low probability trades. If everything doesn't match up on H1 don't GO LOOKING for trades. Even if nothing matches all day.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Are you referring to the macd......?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Correct.

Hi Yomi. Thank you for sharing your trading ideas and great systems. Can you state that this one is the best you have elaborated? Does it have better performance than you traded in "as simple ... 00 level" topic or other your your threads 00 Level Trading: EsikeM30Bomb and fxrabbiM15Bomb: PA Around Breakout &amp; Pullback Trading Can you please make brief comparison of them.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
This is my best trading system (trading made possible with EsikeA+++) for now. Happy weekend, Yomi.

Hi fxrabbi! Thanks for a very good thread. Just one question. I went for a sell got to bed. When a woke up and the EA hade run all the way to a profit of 100 pips then closed the trade. Same thing happend on two pairs. Aren´t it suposed run to maximum profit of 30?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
After a long wait, finally got my pips in double portion. GBPUSD (M5) +31.2pips. Trade Idea: 1. 5ema - the trigger. 2. Price below the 2 MA"s 3. Strength - weaker GBP. 4. 10ema dashboard - ok. 5. DMI - dancing to my music. 6. TrendMirror - ok. 7. Ichimoku - ok. 8. MACD - all the way. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Beautiful trade Yomi . I didn't get home in time to catch it. There was another 5MA cross at 12:05 after your trade but it was going into the pivot. Would you have taken that one too? Thank you.

GU +14.4 Happy trading

Look at your first trade, the MACD is ok, but for the second trades the MACD is NOT ok, but above all, you don't need that second trades since you have meet your daily target with this trading system, this is over-trading my friend. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thanks for your observations. The thing with MACD is, that it was ok when I entered shortly after the close of the previous bar. When I took the trade I was up some 13 pips, not 30.

Hi Sir, I tried trading GBPJPY with this strategy and I lost 60 pips. I learned my lesson to trade only GBPUSD and EURUSD with this system wherein I earned 130 pips.

Haa! This is a late entry..........Your trigger (5ema -arrow) is paramount here and your entry should be the next candle after the trigger or not more than 2 candles after the trigger. Please see the attached chart. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Thanks for pointing that out! Makes sense of course although I did not find this to be a hard rule so far...

As a matter of fact, when the trigger appeared, the CSM was not ok, so I waited till it was as per your post #256, but I shurely waited too long...

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Yes, you waited too long considering the present situation of the market now compared to what happened then as my post 256. To be on a safer side, if the CSM is not giving you a go ahead to takes the trade, please don't wait more than two candles, otherwise let the trade go, another good setup will surely come. Happy trading, Yomi.

What's the rationale for entering the trade?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I can't see the rationale for taking this trade, because your H1 - (DMI) is not ready for this trade at the time you took the trade. See, this is what I do everyday: " I just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime. Even people who lose money in the market say, "I just lost my money, now I have to do something to make it back." No, you don't. You should sit there until you find something." - PDF (Patience, Discipline, and Focus). Happy trading, Yomi.

Csm ok, 5ema ok, Dashboard ok, Ichimoku ok, ADX/R ok, ADR ok, Abs.strength/DO ok, MACD ok, TL break on H1... Must have overlooked something though...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Thanks, I saw the DMI on H1 but there was the TL break - so you don't use that bit?

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Please, take your H1 - DMI very important, it's the key/cover for your winning trades. If your H1 (DMI) is not ok, don't take that trade. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Yes, I use the TL break, but the H1 (DMI) supersede any breakout/breakdown at the TL. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Ok, got it. Talking about TL, a quote from #293: ============ " Trading Ideas for Trendline: I will determine how I enter trade with trendline based on momentum. i.) If I feel we have great momentum I will enter on break of the trendline. ii.) If low momentum, I will enter on close. {?} iii.) If it's a trade I just don't like I'll wait for a pullback and then see if it has gained momentum. Above all, watch-out for where 5ema appear on the candle that break the trendline, that is where the edge is." ============ Would you mind explaining point ii, Thanks again

--- 帖子 #744 ---
good afternoon FXrabbi, my trade today... EURUSD +32.4

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Nice to see your trade here, Brother. This is my takes on your 3 trades: Trade 1: You have no business to takes this trade because your H1 (DMI) is not even giving short/sell direction as at the time you took that trade. Trade 2: That trade has no trigger but, it's ok, and that should have given you, your minimum 15pips. Trade 3: Please read our trading rule No. 2 very well. You don't need that trade again, even if you want more pips, the next trigger should have been your perfect entry. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Please see the attached chart for better understanding, if you are still not clear, please let me know. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Thanks Yomi, I think I now see what you meant in that post - entering either direct when crossing the TL or at the close of the candle that crosses (i &amp; ii); The example you just posted however seems to be a 3rd option - waiting one more candle.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Absolute Strength Histogram and Price to Open indicators repaint like crazy! Has anyone nonrepainting versions?

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Type 1: I will enter at the candle that break the TL. Type 2: I will enter at the close of that candle that break the TL (that is the next candle after the close). Type 3: I will wait for the candle to close above/below the TL and also await for it to do some retracement/pullback, and then get/see a trigger toward the main/original trend and enter. NB : the example I gave in post 746 is type 2. Hope this helps, Yomi. This is Type 3:

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Thanks, that has helped! Amazing, btw, how much sitting on your hands is required for that one good setup....

--- 帖子 #751 ---
SYSTEM UPDATE: This is a one chart trading method NOW. A complete stand alone system on any timeframe, this make it easier to make correct decisions. So, I prefer only M15 TF, and I strongly recommend M15 TF, but it will work on any TF. GBPUSD (M15) +15pips. Trade Idea: 1. Price below the 2 MA's - note the position of the MA's (72/24), very important. 2. Price break the TL. 3. DMI - note how the ADX break ADXr up, inside the DMI's. 4. TrendMirror - ok. 5. MACD - ok. 6. Strength meter - weaker GBP. 7. 10ema dashboard - ok. 8. Ichimoku - ok. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Will the rules in post #1 still apply or will there be updates?

--- 帖子 #753 ---
There is update to post 1 already, please take a look. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Hi fxrabbi A very good trading systems,Since I trade for many years. Thank you for sharing this You want to develop a system for a more simple and to the point. Safety together with respect

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Weldone , the only reservation I have for this trade is the 2 MA's, they are not position well. The 24 (blue) is suppose to be above 72 (red) for buy. This will take care of H1 that we are not watching again for direction. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
May I know what made you take the trade, i.e., criteria in entering the trade?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
EURUSD (M15) +15.8pips. Trade Idea: 1. 5ema trigger - I did not wait for the close of the trigger candle because of the momentum that break the TL. 2. Price below the 2 MA's &amp; DPP. 3. DMI - ok. 4. TrendMirror - ok. 5. MACD - ok. 6. Strength meter - weaker EUR. 7. 10ema dashboard - ok. 8. Ichimoku - ok. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Hi Yomi Well done I found something I am not sure 3. DMI - ok? But I see ADX and ADXr were both below 20 Please THX Honey

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi honeytob, Thank you for your observation and comment. ADX don't necessary need to be above 20 level, all ADX need to do is to be in between DMI - &amp; DMI + , only ADXr need to be above 20 level. In that trade all I did is that I add the power of PA to that trade, in forex once you have the knowledge of PA, you can even trade without them. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
What I observed in this system is if there's momentum, this supersedes an indicator. In this case, although ADXr is below 20, the trade is still good.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
As I said in post 1, this system is a trend following system, as you know trend is a friend to momentum. And sometimes ADXr is a bit slow in its respond, and that is why I use 20 level instead of 25 level, so please add PA to your decision making when it come to taking up a setup. Please also note that when ADXr is rising up below 20 level, it can also give a good signal. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
THX Yomi I am clear now and the rule is more simple than before So where could I acquire the knowledge of PA? Honey

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Screen time is the holy grail and golden goose . Happy trading, Yomi.

SYSTEM UPDATE: Timeframe: This is a one chart trading method. A complete stand alone system on any time-frame, this make it easier to make correct decisions. EsikeA+++ uses the M15/M5 to take primary trades and I use either M15 or M5 according to market conditions. I strongly recommend M15 or M5 TF's depending on your experience. But NOT both. Mind you, it will work on any TF. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Will the rules on M5 be the same as M15, and can we still use H1 as confirmation to give us confidence to enter trade in M5/M15?

--- 帖子 #785 ---
The rules are the same on all timeframes, and we don't need to look at H1 again, the system is a complete stand alone system on any time-frame. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Thank you, Yomi

How did you came here?

--- 帖子 #788 ---

Missed it by distraction, I should lock myself up lol.. Why did you close it manually? - it went +19

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Don't worry many more will come, yes you are right, I close it manually because I was seeing some kind of resistance up there. Happy trading, Yomi.

And, please, do I remember right: TP was 15 in the previous version and SL was 15 too ?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
I'm planning to do system update in respect to TF's, Pairs, and MM. But I'm very busy for the past two weeks: trading with some newbies at home, but will try to do the update before the weekend. Happy trading, Yomi.

Dear Yomi, Great, eagerly awaiting your System. AllHappy

--- 帖子 #803 ---
System Update: 1. Timeframes: I use H1 &amp; M5 TF's, but it will work in any TF. H1 - Direction. M5 - Entry. 2. Pairs: I trade EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, and EURJPY, but it will work on any pairs. 3. Money Management: 1. MM =2%. 2. TP = 20pips. 3. SL = 10pips. 4. BE/Lock-in-pips = 15pips 4. Daily Target = 30pips. 5. Stop trading after reaching daily target. 6. Stop trading after 3 consecutive losses. New PDF in post 1 and post 1 also updated. Happy weekend, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Thanks Yomi. So, basically you reverted back to H1 for direction and added 2 pairs, rest is the same?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Yes

Hi dear fxRabbi! It's nice for me to see you with new work here! But let me ask you, as always Do you realy think, that 1. GU has the same volatility and other characteristics as EJ to use THE SAME indicators parameters and SLs for them??? 2. SL=10 is not to small at all? And is it not to small for EJ?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Tnx

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Dear fxRabbi, When doing the back test, there is nothing to come out. The journal stated that unmatched data error, please advise how to solve it. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #812 ---
GU (M5) +14.8 Happy pips!

--- 帖子 #813 ---
My trade for today:

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Look at this losing trade with all right at all indies. Attached Image (click to enlarge) SL=15 is not enough, I think. We need to add a spread as minimum. Any ideas? Why shoud not I take this trade? Or what was the right SL here? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #815 ---
If you have a perfect entry, the SL of 10pips will be enough. Looking at your entry, the ADX suppose to be in between the DMI+ and DMI -, and yours is outside hence you have a bad trade, always make sure your ADX is between the 2 DMI's when you want to takes your entry. See post post 812 &amp; 813 for examples. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Between ONLY? Or between or higher bots DMI+ and DMI- ???

--- 帖子 #819 ---
When you have a perfect setup/entry the SL of 10pips will be enough for the 4 pairs. But, not to worry I will soon share my other method of trading this system with M30 TF, where I also have a greater success, but with SL of 20pips and TP of 30pips. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Even without spread?

--- 帖子 #821 ---
This I don't understand what you mean here...... But the ADX - which is the dotted red line MUST always be in between the green line (DMI+) and the red line (DMI-) by the time you want to take your trade. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
plus spread. The EA has taken consideration of the spread (spread of 2 pips). Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Hello Sir, how can I make the signal arrows nearer to the price, and how can I alter the EA settings so that the pips counter will be 2 decimal places..... as in the chart, I gained 22 pips but it is reflected as 2.2....

--- 帖子 #824 ---
My new way of trading this beautiful system now: GBPUSD (M30) +31pips. Trade Idea - Level 1 entry: 1. 5ema - the trigger. 2. DMI. 3. TrendMirror - Level 1 entry. 4. + others: i.) price vs the 2 MA's. ii.) Strength meter. iii.) 10ema dashboard. iv.) Ichimoku. v.) MACD. NB: TP = 30pips. SL = 20pips. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Signal arrows: see the attached if you want the signal arrow. Pips counter: Check the attached settings, otherwise and likely cause is that you have made some losses before that trade. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Nice one Yomi. Kindly share the EA setting and template for your M30 system on #Post 1 Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
No problem

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Dear Yommi, please look at this H1 chart, 25.04.2016-27.04.2016: Attached Image (click to enlarge) These 3 days are up trend and ADX is above both DMI+ and DMI-. Do you think it's not an up-trend signal/marker? Thank you for your ideas!

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Thanks, Yomi, I'll alter my settings corresponding to the illustration...

--- 帖子 #830 ---
The ADX was inside the DMI's on the 25-04-2016 hence there was strong up trend and good setups there also, but the rest days although good up trend, but not strong enough to produce good setups. Please watch out for my M30Bomb TF trading system. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Welcome to EsikeA+++ with M30Bomb. Post 1 updated with complete indicators + templates + trading rules + MM and new PDF. To your success and happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Why did you decide to remove H1 as a trend direction detector?

--- 帖子 #833 ---
With M30 TF you will not need H1 TF again. This M30 TF works like a charm and very simple. Happy trading, Yomi.

10 reasons you're not making money trading: 1. You're over-trading. 2. You are not managing risk properly. 3. You aren't preserving trading capital for good trades. 4. You trade the news. 5. You read too many websites and opinions. 6. You're trading with too small of an account. 7. You aren't placing stop losses properly. 8. You aren't disciplined enough. 9. You aren't patient enough. 10. You don't know what you're doing. Happy trading, Yomi.

Thanks Yomi for the system update. May I know what are the 2 MAs in the chart? I'm going to install them manually because when I installed the new system to my chart, the 2 MAs are missing.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
I have replaced the 2 MA's with Daily Open Line, please read my update on post 1. NB: Don't load it manually, try to load my template. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Please download the file again, may be you have the old file on your system.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Hello Yomi, Pls post sample image with Daily Open Line. Your level 1 entry setup image on #Post 1 is not showing what the Daily Open Line (white dotted line) should look like. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hello Yomi Q1. How do we read the ABR status? Q2. How do we apply the Average Daily Range? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
1. ABR status take care of our trading rules No. 2, which says that "Do not enter trades when the size of the last candle is more than double the ATR of that pairs for that day". So if the ABR (ATR) is 17pips, that means if the "last" is over 34pips (which is double the ABR (ATR) of 17pips) in this type of situation your pass over this trade and wait for another set-up. 2. If you see that ADR has reached potential value it can give you attention to say out of that pairs as this pair may stop move further that day. If for example, Average Daily Range for GBPUSD is 132pips which is for average of 5days and for Today (ATR) is 75pips, this means that we still have enough room for our trade. But in a way where Today (ATR) is 145pips, which has reached the the Average Daily Range for GBPUUSD and even passed it, this mean no trade for me on GBPUSD today. If the ATR has been reached, there is a bigger chance the price might reverse on you, so why take the risk and enter a trade. Finally, it's set like that to keep you out of trouble, more often than not price won't exceed the ADR. It's all about taking the high probability setups. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Very helpful explanation Many thanks Yomi.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Thank you so much YOMI.........!!! I have n't had such a good knowledge about - ATR / ABR and how to use it.... this is so clear..... very helpful!!! cheer... wish u more PIPS...............

--- 帖子 #859 ---
EsikeA+++ EA: 1. Serve as a script for placing trade @ market order &amp; pending order@.50/.100 level. 2. Serve as trade manager - taking care of my trades, this includes MM/SL/TP etc etc. NB: You can find this in the expert folder. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Thank you !!!

--- 帖子 #862 ---
fxrabbi... for some reasons it doesn't put trades on. I marked "allow live trading" and activated auto trading (got smile) but nothing happens when I press any button. Do you have any idea how to fix it? thanks. EDIT : fxrabbi, EA can close the trade that I opened manually but still, it can not put a trade when I press buy/sell.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
It could be any of the followings: 1. Low capital balance on the account. 2. Maybe your broker uses "prefix" or "suffix" symbol. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Hello Yomi.Please explain these checklists . 1.Ichimoku status(If negative then we will take only short trades or if positive then we will take long only trades.The more the negative/positive the more it's better to trade) 2.Trend Mirror level 1/2 entry(Level 1 means-The Price To Open (1440) color must be established first, and then the ASH change to match it.) 3.maximum of 2 candles after the trigger and must correspond/line- up with level 1 entry. Kind regards Saad

--- 帖子 #865 ---
1. Ichimoku - Yes, you are right, negative for sell and positive for buy, on all TF - M15 to H1. 2. TrendMirror - yes, you are right - ( the main entry for this system, but there are other entries). 3. If the next (second) candle after the trigger match-up with level 1 entry take it, and if it's the next, next (third) candle after the trigger that match-up with level 1 entry take it also, but don't take any more after this , otherwise it will be come late entry. So let your level 1 entry have the final say here. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Thanks Yomi.Please check this chart.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
YES. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
What dord ASH stand for?

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Also, is there such a thing as level 2? Also is there still an advanced entry?

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Hello Yomi thx for sharing your trading ideas\thoughts\indicators\templates and so on I liked your previous system "00 Level Trading: EsikeM30Bomb" 'cos it's actually VERY similar to my own trading system,I mainly trade M15 TimeFrame why did you stop trading the original system? not a big deal,as I can see the system explained in this new thread has got some similarities with the previous one but I'd like to know your opinion I really appreciate your posts bye

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Dear Yommi Could you tell us, why did you move from the classical understanding of ADX (as more as stronger trend) to your own vision (right between DMI's)? I have read many times ADX's specification (for example http://www.investopedia.com/articles...-indicator.asp ) but found no link with your version. Could you share any document or link about it? Thank you for all your ideas!

--- 帖子 #872 ---
The link you shared is only about ADX. This trading system is about DMI, While ADX is just part of it. Do your research very well, I don't encourage spoonfeeding here. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
AbsoluteStrengthHistogram. There are level 1 entry, level 2 entry, level 3 entry, and level 4 entry. But for the purpose of this thread, I will only limit myself to Level 1 entry, because is the best and most reliable of the four levels. Happy trading, Yomi.

--- 帖子 #874 ---

Strength meter. c.) 10ema dashboard. d.) Ichimoku status. e.) ABR/ATR status. Happy trading, Yomi.

I will update post 1 very soon with the indicators file and new template that contain esikeStochs. Please read post 1 very well, everything is there. Yes, you are right, but when both the ADX and ADXr are in-between the DMI's, the trend is usually fantastically strong. Happy trading, Yomi

Hello Yomi good idea to take back some good indicators from the previous system I've been watching DMI besides my usual manual trading system I think it could be good,but I need to watch more charts, do u use DMI as a reference only at M30 candle closure? about DMI,here is a good idea for some coders around this Forum: a simple Dashboard= signals when ADX and ADXr are between DMI's and ADXr is above 20 level. bye

Yomi today I had some free time to watch your indicators especially DMI I've been watching your charts\templates beside my usual chart\templates please watch my example suppose all the others indicators were aligned,and you were waiting for DMI only would have you entered at vertical bar 1,2 or 3? I'm just curious about this indi,'cos I've had a lot of good trades today,and this indicator was never in agreement thx

This your trade example is not the Basic entry ( which I like to limit myself to). This is an advance trade where you will need level 1 entry and the trigger (5ema) of this system to enter this trade. Why this is not the basic entry: i.) Not level 1 entry. ii.) esikeStochs - already in oversold area, so it need the trigger (5ema). ps: read the checklist for entry in post 1, and always make sure you filter your trade with level 1 entry (trendmirror). Happy trading, Yomi.

thx Yomi for your quick reply but my question is not about level 1,Ema trigger or esike Stochs my question is about DMI only please read carefully my question again : "...... please watch my example suppose all the others indicators were aligned ,and you were waiting for DMI only would have you entered at vertical bar 1,2 or 3?.." many thx

--- 帖子 #891 ---
I understood your question very well, what I am saying is that no matter the position of the DMI always filter/enter your trade with level 1 entry. Back to your question, vertical line 2 &amp; 3 should be ok to enter trade if other things are in place. Happy trading, Yomi.
