Hi All, I am opening up a System 2(with irony) to trade the AUD on 5 mins during Asia as I cannot trade the EUR in London and NYC session. This thread is notfor new people to System2 , if you want to know what System 2 is then read the whole System 2 thread and get familar with what FCR's 123S 123D FCR2 and their respected exits before asking what they are in this thread please also make sure you read the system2 primary thread to ensure you keep up to date with whats happening. System 2 can be found here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=80290

Sorry, deleted the previous post as I uploaded a wrong pic Anyways, AUD traded long at 0.9306 Waiting for an FCR to form to move my stops

--- 帖子 #3 ---
moved SL to under FCR

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Broke it and went straight back in. Lets see if the candle will close above the HH line before I make any decisionss. Maybe a runner for the day? Maybe nothing. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Price spiked up through the HH but I didnt close it and was stopped out at BE. Short now based on the FCR.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Moevd SL to .09313

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Chris, I will join u time to time as i have the same problem with trading london and NY session.It is look funny bcz i live in London but my bloody full time job at this sessions ,so I just can only watch. Happy trading today .

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This trade is sitting at +22 at the moment, waiting for a pullback and will close if it does and the test of the LL fails. OR. I could just close at +21 and be done with it for a 1:1.25 trade... I chose to control my emotions and see what the market will give me, playing number 1 all the way and see if it will give me anything

--- 帖子 #9 ---
en0x, thanks for opening this aussie trade i'll watch and learn.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hey FX , yeah I live in Sydney and work a full time job so trading NYC was just impossible for me. The method works well on any major I believe, just make sure we get to know its behavior and when the market is trading it.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Chart so far. I will flip between Oanda and MT4 charts. I use oanda to enter my accounts but find it harder to mark fo posting. So if you see me post an Oanda chart its just I dont have time to open up MT4 and draw things so I just use my live chart.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Ben, I take it you are a system2 trader? If so feel free to post charts and trade with me. Its kinda lonely here Paul M from System 2 will also join us sometimes as well as a few others. I am hoping Froggy10 comes on board as he is a audusd trader too (as far as I know he uses System2)

--- 帖子 #13 ---
9280 seems to be the daddy of all daddy levels to break here. Now, should I give away all my profits to hold for a test of the LL again if it happens? Fark yeah, its only money and there is another day out there tomorrow. Lets see if price will reverse right back to BE to get me out or go down to test the LL again. Might be a foolish decision but time will tell.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Moved SL to 9298 above the FCR.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi chris I will also join you from time to time. I just need to watch for a little while to get used to the Aussie.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Attempted at LL, lets se what she is doing, if it fails I am out..

--- 帖子 #17 ---
its just broken but can it sustain it? If candle doesnt close below line I am out.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thing has stupidly slowed down. Closed for +26. So two for today, +26 and breakeven. The breakeevn one could have been at least +20 but I failed to close on the failed HH break. Such is life, tomorrow is another day. Oh and there goes price after me getting out... BAH. I got to stop doing that annoying thing...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Watching for long. break of this FCR and I will be playing it as an FCR2 and play #2g+ exit. unless ,of course, an fcr forms between now and if the fcr breaks then I will adjust accordingly.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I am leaving for the day, got stuff to do. See you guys tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
no im not there yet ! still reading and learning how you scalp with the naked chart and im loving it especially the chart/s you post, keep them coming buddy, i'll visit here often thats for sure!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Good Morning AUD traders. Lets see what AUd wants to do today. Just a reminder its chinese news today in about 5 hours or so. Not sure what it will do but no harm in noting it.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Good Morning I have been having the same issues as enox, not being able to trade the euro for NYC. Missing runners while often sustaining losses in the london session. I won't be here every day as I still need to work to pay the mortgage but often work from my home office so will be trading then ..... OK got trades set at 9310 and 9283

--- 帖子 #24 ---
good day chris - could use some mojo today, after the New York market a little movement would be nice. Will stand with you since my afternoon meeting was canceled.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
OK.. Long from 9310. Calling it a 123s and playing #2 but will be watching closely and not giving it much room as close to major HH

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Out of the long for -10. In hindsight waited to long could have got out at -5. ... blah blah blah

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I am still hanging in there. blah

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Yeah with you Sedona, still holding my stop is 9292 (hard stop) . Very slow at the moment :-/

--- 帖子 #29 ---
my mental stop is a close below 9300

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Sedona and Chris well done for hanging on. Unfortunatley i moved my hard stop to 9300, when i had to pop out. Should have moved it away when i got back but didn't blah blah blah. Lets hope it breaks north

--- 帖子 #31 ---
too early for us to crow - have a couple of hurdles in front of us

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I'm not a system 2 trader, however just reading your posts from yesterday my set-ups were pretty similiar to yours. nice thread.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
out at -10 which means the market is going to take off - stuck to my plan though I feel like I was being a little tight on my expectations.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I am short at 9295 off the fcr

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I am calling it a bracket. Short order at 9293

--- 帖子 #36 ---
yep didn't go back far enough and am out - 10

--- 帖子 #37 ---
This market needs some prunes

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Guys, we have chinese data out soon, maybe market is waiting on that? I am still long ...

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Right, I ended up being stopped out for -20 and taking the short. That was bad bad bad on my part. Poor form, I moved my SL down with hope the news would actually do what it was thought to be done. See, get clever, get your ass wipped , that is what the prof traders want, us to be clever so they can take our cash. anyways, short now. lets see if we going to get SOME movement for the day. wow, slow slow day.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I took another -10 on the fakeout long. Short now from 9291.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Closed short at -12. Reminder to myself...... DONT trade chinese news

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Double down today 2 for 2 losses. -40 Both my fuck ups, most I should have lost was -10 over both of them.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Late start for me today... I am sitting out until after unemployment news....

--- 帖子 #44 ---
OK big news spike. I wasn't willing to trade it after being faked out twice on yesterdays news. Long order set at 9372 on a 123s. Lets see if there is any momentum left in this.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Short now from 9345. Off the FCR at 9348. Back to snail pace.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Out -10. Might have been a bit hasty. Could have been played as a number two and held on.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Long from 0.9240

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Moved stop loss to Break Even. After large pull back playing #1. Will exit for max profit or let it run if the god of Fx deems it so

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Exited the long for +8 Pips after failed to break HH.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
out for +1 What do you think of hte idea of targetting our trades paul?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I think its a fine idea. Long runs in asia session seem pretty rare.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
thanks for the chart en0x , love the entry and i save it ! http://img39.imagefra.me/img/img39/1...2m_956a5f0.png

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hey Chris, didn't know you set this thread up, I will be joining in too now. Had a dose of the flu in recent weeks, so have been out of communication. cheers.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Short at .9262

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi folks, en0x just pointed me in this direction, hope to contribute a little to the discussion. 1 trade for today - IN - 0.9295 OUT - 0.9276 + 19 Happy to field questions if you have them.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
And a long order about 9290? cheers

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Took a long at .9279, above the fractal shown on my chart, currently +7 pips, looking to bank +10

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Maybe this ones got some legs on it?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Yes, lets do this

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Good entry. There is some good advice on the System II thread regarding taking profits too early, might be worth a look if you haven't done so already.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Do you target or play the plan (let price take you out?) This is directly related to 5min AUD during ASIA only. NOT EUR. I find the runners iN AUD quite weak.. want to know your opinion.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Still holding atm John, yes, still have to read thru the whole thread, taking me a while still, just browsing through this one quickly though, seems the general consensus is that runners are'nt overly common with the aussie? Or is the aussie traded exactly the same as the euro, as shown on the other system thread?Thats why i wasn't looking for too much, couple big bear candles on my chart atm however. cheers

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I think we need to explore this, how much is a good run for Aussie during asia without massive news moving it? Lets play and look together , I am glad we got some people. I am long with you on this since 9281, HH has formed which was higher then the previous pullback, we are not in any danger yet which is good. Bearish candles are also having smaller bodies so we might see another attempt at the HH. watching HH to play number 1 to preserve. If it fails I will bail and set new entry above.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
AUD in the general rising against the USD and it is best to trade long after large retracements. Now is the time for long.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Have to go out for a bit. Will answer in detail later tonight.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
A key aspect of this method, for the Euro, is the offset between profitable runners, and a low success rate on each trade. The runners are critical to balance out the high rate of losing/BE trades, and if profits are taken early, the runners will be missed. To use a target profit level requires a higher success rate on each trade. So what will the success rate be on AUD using SystemII? Should it be any different from the Euro.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi John888, This is exactly my point. The problem I have been seeing the last few weeks is the runners are very rare. so will it work? Not sure. The question is shall we try target method 1 first and if so what target shall we attempt? Or should we check out the runners and see how they perform and play the plan.? only trading live will get use stats.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
What basis have you come to this conclusion?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
we on a free ride now gents.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
New fcr at 9284

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Shodd, I just read your post on AUD times in the other thread. All I can say is I like it I do often see movement at 10:30am Sydney time though, which is around 9:30TKY time, so I will start my morning around 10am Sydney and trade AUD to 11pm at night Lets do this gents, as a famous person onces said, lets kick ass and chew bubblegum... and I am all outta bubblegum...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
That would be a disaster, lol, if there are fewer/smaller runners than the Euro ! I guess some forward testing is called for, as you say. Looking at today, the 11.50 am 3 hour "runner" was 20 - 25 pips, but the exchange rate difference means this equates to 30 - 38 pips on the Euro.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Exactly, so lets drop the load and test test test.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Basically we are in uncharted territory , so lets chart it and find out what expectation should be for AUD

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Enox mate, so where's your stop now? Around the .9284 region the new fcr, as pointed out by John, that's where i got out for about 6 pips, and needless to say am regretting it. I'm settled, no more targets for me. Some bubblegum for me too please sir

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Stop is under the FCR at 9285 (so you are right). So my actual stop is at 9282 (9285 -3)

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Closed the long for +12 ont he failure to break the HH, reentry above that to not miss trade. Although we do have london coming to an open soon.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Re-entered the long at 9301. Hlding , new HH has formed.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Was delt a fakeout therefor played number 2 and closed at -1. Not hoping and preying. London has 30 mins till open

--- 帖子 #80 ---
My long update. Closed for -1, played number 2

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I have been mucking around with oanda charts. They are very crap charting. Not this has to do with anything but their Fib tool is shocking. It just makes more FUD then anything :/ No i dont use fib btw, you see it on the chart as I was playing around being bored

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Maybe I should have played number 2 better , I think I fluffed that trade , waht do you think guys?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Anyawys, back in the trade. Poor form En0x, poor form on that trade. Testing 9318 , will see how it goes. Will play #2 properly this time/ Entry was 9313.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
OK, I am in 2 minds about posting the below, as it may confuse or cloud the issue for some. But I'll post it anyway and if people find it not appropriate I'll remove it.... en0x asked earlier whether I target or exit based on price action. The answer is a mix of both. There's a fair amount of discretion involved in my trading, which I will try and describe over the coming weeks. I am a full time scalper (operating off second charts) so I am very much used to reading the ticks as they come in. This reading of ticks is what I based my decision to go for a target or exit on PA. Although excellent, I don't really use fxachilies' defensive strat on trade management as I trust my own ability to make the correct decision the majority of the time. We have to trade in a way that is comfortable to ourselves after all. As for the merits of AUDUSD itself - I believe it to be a worthwhile pair to trade, but I don't believe you can apply the exact same trade parameters that are used for the EURUSD. The Aussie is appealing because it doesn't suffer those difficult to trade through spikes that you see particularly on Sterling pairs, and the swings as a result are "nice and smooth". Don't discount this characteristic off hand - smooth movers make it a lot easier to sit in a position through the heat of battle (much easier to relax). Off course I'm talking about this in the context of suitable trade times (ie non news and appropriate market hours). So, many have noted that the runners are small in comparison to the Euro. This is an accurate assessment. This is where the altering of certain parameters comes into play. History has shown that the average volatility of the Aussie is about 65-75% of the Euro. Knowing this we can alter our maximum stop loss position (and increase load to compensate if you wish) to more closely match the average volatility of the Aussie. What I have done is alter my max SL to on average 16 pips and have increased load accordingly. Of course I am speaking in general terms; sometimes my SL will be larger if I don't like where it's positioned etc. By the way, don't take any of the above as gospel - you all need to do the necessary amount of backforward testing so that you can have confidence in what I am talking about. A very successful trader I know once told me to always "trust but verify" information given. Let me know if any of the above is unclear.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Shodd, seems like you and AUD are long time lovers yeah, its damn slower but more predictble. I will try stick to it without going mad.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
LOL not quite I like AUD for this approach, but there's no way I would scalp her... Do some backtesting with smaller SL and increased load. You might be surprised.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Its pay day this Friday and the first thing on my pay day list is forextester 2 that is my fun time for the next few weeks while forward testing, is to back test AUD trading this ideology I can trade one bar a time manually so it is perfect during those down times (aka at home ;P )

--- 帖子 #88 ---
hi, i wonder if it is possible to trade the audusd ´with the system II rules like we used from the very beginning of the system II thread. I took this short after 38 Pips swing and a retracement less 50% My SL is 0,9315 and i will trail it by chance EDIT: SL trigert

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Morning folks. Pending order in short @ 0.9282

--- 帖子 #90 ---
short .9282 the swing is only 16 pips, retrace 11 pips so target would not be much more than 10 pips

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Morning, looks like we're both short now at 9282.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Trade I am in now.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Good morning from the blessed land down under Another wonderful day in Sydney here. Lets see if AUD wants to let up and lets see what we can do with her. Tomorrow I am getting the Forextester software, going to spend the weekend backtesting AUD during our trading time (10am Sydney - 11pm Sydney) and see how she plays out over the last 3 months.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
morning, was busy writing , missed ure post

--- 帖子 #95 ---
hi, en0x very interisting with the last short, u play #2 or #G+?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
This is a great question... Honestly, I was thinking of playing #2g+ and this is what we need to test here and what we are doing. I actually played it with a hard stop above the HH (as shown with the red line) , price came through the break but I decided to see if a pullback was going to form. we need to figure out, shall we play the exit rules as they stand ? they where very well tested and proven in EUR or shall we use the standard #2 exits? I honestly dont know , I think we need to test this. I am going to do some serious testing this weekend (manual backtesting)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Example of another play. So now we have another example of I dont know how AUD reacts. With EUR you would discoun this level 9270 (support) and trade it as #1 or jus take profits at targets such as this. we really need some testing. right now I am playing just these, #2 for fakeouts (remember #2 says that when price comes back to the breakeven point, you asses back at that level in case it breaks, this time the bear candle was SOLID and hard so break was very much possible, hence why I didnt close at break even) and number 1 for all trades. Now the question, normally we would consider trades above oh,, say around 12 for EUR as a semi fakeout and play a #1 to preserve and to take max profits. I dont know what we should judge in AUD, because 10 pip candle is pretty damn big in AUD This is why I was hopign to take in some of Shodds experiance with AUD in general./

Yen and Euro down after Tokyo open which suggests that USD is driving this move (as per usual really). Euro is at 50 at the moment, which is causing the other 2 pairs to stutter. Be nimble...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Euro holding below 50 atm which is good. Aussie just broke the low of the 11:10 bar so also positive. Hang tight but be nimble. I'll be out on a breach of 76, so 6 in the can guaranteed

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Eish, everything is made to be broken but no harm in watching it closely.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Out @ 62 for a neat 20. Next...

--- 帖子 #103 ---
9270 was my tp, 12 pips maybe too early

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Dont like that big candle, closed +17

--- 帖子 #105 ---
What was your reason for 62? Was it based on a target or some other reason?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Got out at 9270, maybe early but ....

--- 帖子 #107 ---
very nice

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Buyers started hitting the ask with more force.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
thats it for me for tonight, c u later

--- 帖子 #110 ---
No, this is wrong wrong wrong.... we play number 1 if price goes over 10 pips, simple. I played this WRONG . Order set for 09258 for reentry. This is never going to work(testing) unless I play number 1 properly. Sorry guys, bad exit on my half. I am to test playing number 1, not targets or anything else.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
The failure of the previous candle to close below the LL and the next candle going up was the correct exit for number 1 play if anybody is interested. I didnt play that correctly, 0.9275

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I decided not to hang on for #1, due to RBA talking head at 12, and breach of halfway point in the big bear candle. For me it comes down to what is the reason is for the exit, what emotions drive the decision. cheers

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I am a little concerned that reporting my trades here will cloud the view of others. Like I said, I handle trade management slightly differently - so for the time being I might keep quiet on this front. Will still be around to talk concepts though.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
An interesting question, as it might be a different trade mgmt that leads us to an evolution of System II for AUD. Who knows? As long as we keep it simple, and repeatable. Wash rinse repeat.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Chris and the gang, I finally made it to here.. nice going Chris.. i skipped through the pages and one thing that stand out to me was the slower pace of this pair and lack of long rides (runners) issue and the system II runner mentality may not be suitable.. my humble answer here would be.. who cares.. lol.. sure runners are important but so is PRESERVING. with the new development of what we do in system II inregards to the PLAN.. we got this thing called #1 play.. its a offenseive play.. its purpose is to keep u in the ride to take max advantage.. now, this does not mean that every one of your #1 situation has to turn into a runner.. the fact is that it does only about 1/3 of the times.. if u look at most of the true system II follwers, their signature is called "Survive and Preserve".. there is a reason for that and we can not deviate ourselves from the "preserve " part not with trading this pair or any other pair or any other system IMO.. and i think this could be the saviour here for you, a to how deal best with this beast.. be alittle more keen on preserving with #1 play with this pair.. so, for example when u fall into a 20pips profit and a retrace, then a price resumes back to your direction at this point go to work and really watch the price speed and rhythm.. if any price hesitation to break the LL/HH or anywhere near it go ahead and preserve pips right there due to slow pace nature of this pair.. now, Chris.. u were on live trade with me yesterday with the gang.. show'em how just like what I/we did yesterday. so #1play is offence and preserve.. this is how we get saved on the slow days in system II E/U pair aswell.. good examlple of it, its been pretty much the whole present week up to now.. we have had 100-130pips total movment for the day but its been rough rides.. but with offense/preserve tag team we have been able to still stick to our plan and squeez pips out of the market and maintain the level of consistency that we are used too. anyways.. I hope this helps u guys.. i am a humble observer.. and Chris is my pal.. keep on plugging buddy. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Thanks for your words, fx. Much appreciated. AUD has been good today, may not be tomorrow, but we shall see.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
As a spanish guy we know says , jejejeje Thanks for that FX, lets keep plugging away.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looking back at todays chart now, it seems obvious that we should have stayed in the trade for a lot longer. I have to just follow the plan.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
A re-entry @58 would have been perfectly valid.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Fx thank you. It is when I think "what would Fx say here" that I am most successful, and most relaxed.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Yes, hindsight is great , but we should really play number 1 with renentry. Anywyas, you know what they say about hindsight I did renter on the 58 break

--- 帖子 #122 ---
hi.. I got some free time this monring so i decided to look at AUD for u and help out maybe a bit.. now i understand this is good day for this pair 80 pips run.. but it don't matter good days bad days, do what i suggest and you lose less on bad days.. trust me.. and thats always a plus.. if u entered on the 1st opporutnity u really should be hanging on to this baby to close to very end for a good 50 pips gain.. as u see price parted well away from the trigger point and put u in the driversit and never attempted to break a fcr.. if u missed the 1st opp then u got a 2nd and 3rd chance to preserve some pips out of this run, since it got a little rough.. guys I understand hindsight.. and i am a nonbeliver on it.. but i attempt to bring the hindsight to reality for myself.. and i do it everyday by sticking to plan.. easier said than done, trust me I know all about that, but hey keep on plugging.. practise makes perfect.. I hope it helps.. Good luck.. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/attach/gif.gif

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yes, I see. Sometimes I take "mini" FCRs which is stupid. A FCR is a FCR, there are no "mini" FCRs , they dont exist , maybe as point to preserve. Try again tomorrow, at least I can stay awake for AUD I am going to do some serious homework this weekend. To get myself used to seeing the proper FCRs.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Yesterday was sweet as chocolate cake. I hope everyone got that drop on aussie on the double bottom break?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I will be able to trade with you for a couple of hours today.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Short order at 76, lets see what AUD wants to do.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Guys, I am battling to screenshot here , so I will just type it I have my short entered at 9176, on 123S break, therefore I will play defensive number 2 should it be a fakeout, which is looking likely. hard Stop is 9196

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I am thinking about this - quite often it seems that price moves after the open and then does either a retrace or goes to the other end of the bracket. So I am thinking it may might be better if I don't take the first BB trade after the market opens but wait for a 123 to develop after the opening or take the first trade that breaks the bracket to the other side of the first bracket break - gives the market time to develop a direction. open to your thoughts on this

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Looks like our first fakeout for the morning, playing number 2 to preserve my capital. but IF we start getting back to LL watch it , in case it breaks and we still riding the down. If not we close close to breakeven as possible and place a reentry order in.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Good point BUT, if you choosy like this then yesterday you would have missed the massive drop that gave us a quick 20 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
relook at the chart - what I see is that the big drop happened after a low was established and then the retrace for a 123 entry

--- 帖子 #132 ---
My frekkin PC is messing up :/ cant open my charts...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Play it like that , maybe you have a point. I took the short on the break. Maybe its a good idea to play breaks like that then. Normally range breakouts come with a pullback to the line in slower times, maybe we play that in AUD instead of just pure bracket breakouts in the opening sessions? I am playing the defensive plans we where given so hey, should be fine, lets see. btw, what you talking about gives you a better MM

--- 帖子 #134 ---
so given what I said - my short is 9171 - only 5 pips difference and the market has time to figures itself out

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Closed it -10. Sedona, certainly look at that idea of yours. Might be an idea

--- 帖子 #136 ---
now do I wait for the break of the other side - if it happens or take the fcr2 trade at 9190? 9 pips can be a lot on this pair -

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I have my order at 97.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I am going to wait for the break of the upper bracket - may cost me a few pips but I like the more conservative play this early in the session.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Might have been a winner Sedona, looks like a choppy smelly monster forming

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Maybe - nice strong candle forming shall see it it can keep its momentum

--- 帖子 #141 ---
So am in with a long - see what happens - will be playing a G2 for my deense and a #1 for my offense

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Been in since 97 so lets see...

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Playing number 1 milk the crap out of this now, MOVE IT AUD.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
gotr some hurdles, 9211 then 9220 We at the first hurdle.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Tesd of 9211, had a small pullback but seems we testing it and bulls are in front at the moment. I have my SL to break even as that is 9197, below the 00 and below the previous HH so at least away from the heat.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Next hurdle

--- 帖子 #147 ---
9220 here we come. Come on bulls, bust them bears a bit, it that is cleared I can only see the 9235 and 9250 as next hurdles. Correct me if I am wrong. Playing number 1 still.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Nice trading guys

--- 帖子 #150 ---
time to see if 9211 holds as support

--- 帖子 #151 ---
out at BE - reload - Chris the advantage of taking the first FCR gives you more room to breath

--- 帖子 #152 ---
That is one big ass candle...

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Very very whippy isnt it... Closed at break even. 0/2 so far.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
yep - good news for me was I didn't hesitate to exit when it formed

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Yip, take them all in future, I prefer solid ones like 9192 (which is where I entered) as opposed to 9185. Heh, the thing is moving on up isnt it, just to tease us

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Good point -

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Short @0.9183

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Move S/L at BE.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
My Pc keeps messing up, was busy rebooting when 83 was hit, my short order at 9171 is in though. SL above 9183 :/ My stupid work PC keeps fecking up....

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I am out of here - have a meeting - good lessons tonight. Good job chris

--- 帖子 #161 ---
S/L hit.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Re-enter @9165

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Still short, I didnt stop myself out as price wasnt moving past 9185.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yes, putting S?L at B/E is always tricky but tempting. Like beach trades

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Guys, I have to run to lunch, setting tp at 9150 (+21) and setting SL at break even. See you briefly

--- 帖子 #166 ---
TP removed. SL still at brake even.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hmm, I got in very late , missed and mised again (been busy) 9204 was my entry but playing it tight as a continuation. Damn good work. I think we could trade AUD and make some cash, what you think TGH?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I like AUDUSD. Also NZDUSD looks HOT. It's time to try to push couple of futures

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Also FEB mentioned GBPJPY with pivot points. Let's make an Asian session a little private ATM.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Stopped @0.9194. +22 pips

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Another very good Asian session for the AUD today folks. Hope you all caught a few.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Morning folks. Just a quick note to remind the rest of you AUD tragics that it's a bank holiday in Japan today and to be extra nimble.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
hey guys il try trading the a/u today, what are your thoughts on this pair for those who have tried it out for awhile now?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Potato, normally it's a smooth mover which can make trading it easier on your psych. You do need to (IMO) lower your expectations in terms of pips lost and won however as it does not have the range that the Euro has.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
If anyone else getting higher spreads this morning? I'm consistently getting 3 pips, or higher.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi John - on most platforms you will and it's a direct result of lower than normal liquidity slash volume today. On my setup it's not that much different however, so it does depend on your broker.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
long at .9184, not looking too good atm

--- 帖子 #188 ---
out -7, short at .9162....long maybe at .9194??

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Potatoe, I have just completed two weeks worth of backtesting, while this is no where near complete the intrim results are that AUD is very whippy, and so far the runners are rare. I wont post the results yet, I will post montly backtesting results as I finish them. However I am still forward testing it My trade from today so far.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
The nice thing about backtesting aud is adjusting my expectation on the pair. Its an odd one, but certainly can make money off it, so far the two weeks netted 20% return(btw, EUR can return this in a week using this method so that is how whippy and slow AUD can be) I want to see what the results are month in month out to get an average.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Have you reduced your stop size (and therefore increased your load) en0x? This will of course change your % return.....

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Its a doubled edged sword, reducing your stops to basically a random number with no meaning(stops not outside heat) then you will get stopped more often... No, also what I have been doing in the test is testing another target method. Will explain when i post the results of the targetted method and the full chase the runner method(so I can compare them myself)

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Being delt a fake out here, Long from 81.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
yeh i was planning to trade the a/u today, but ive watched it for a few days and realised that it moves quite similarly to the e/u. so instead ive traded the e/u. but itll be interesting to see how u guys go in a few more months. il keep watchin this thread

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Stalling at 9190

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Closed it +5(ytes, its going up, poor call by myself but tough, I am out) 3 trades today -8 (this was atrade that wasnt supposed to be, pressed market order intead of limit order... dont trade when you doing 10 other things) +27 +5 Now to get back to work, might not post for a little while, very busy at work. Potatoe go for it sir , EUR is the rocking pair, especially Ldn and NYc, you will make a killing if you can trade those two sessions.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
too cautious there En0x , tsk tsk tsk anyways hope you are still riding it, good to at least the psych 00 level. [quote=en0x;3252284]Closed it +5(ytes, its going up, poor call by myself but tough, I am out)

--- 帖子 #198 ---
There shouldn't be anything random about it. I've said before that the AUD moves approx 65-75% of the Euro. Below is an example (my 2nd trade for the day) - 16 pip risk on this one.....

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Shodd, are you adding spread +3 on your price? 16 pips = 20 pips for me, not sure how I am going to lessen this... my position size is based on a median of 20 pips for hard stop. I dont ever hard set it but some trades are riskier (greater then 20 pips) and some are less. AUD is an expensive pair for me on Oanda . BTW, I am not questioning you , just trying to figure out how you are making the SL less because I dont see how this is possible.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I see how I have confused you now sorry mate. My spread on the aussie is usually around 1-2. In the example I gave my max risk was 16 pips including spread, so again sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Dont apologise , just trying to understand. Are you using any pips on the break? like 3+ because my downside of that break was 9162 and the top side is 9176. That = 14 pips, +3 = 17 spread = 18-19, and this is a cheap trader. But seriously, love your ideas and value you them that is why I am asking

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Just remember that in System II stops are almost never hit, they exist mainly in case of extreme moves or loss of comms or trading platform. Exits are taken before hard stop is hit. Is the AUD move of 65-75% of EUR measured in pips? If so that would be equivalent to an equal percentage move in the EUR.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Yeah, it does hit full Sl a few times actually but still the method works wonderfully to make money overall. Hard stops are there to protect you from nasty fakeouts, which happen believe it or not. Especially on whippy days.. Sometimes you just cannot play number 2 no matter what you do... There is no point to this, my question to shodd is where he placed his stops in that instance, just trying to get his insight. Btw, I do think trading AUD is worth while, not nearly as nice as EUR but certainly not something to trash during our session

--- 帖子 #204 ---
[quote=en0x;3252442]Yeah, it does hit full Sl a few times actually but still the method works wonderfully to make money overall. Hard stops are there to protect you from nasty fakeouts, which happen believe it or not. Especially on whippy days.. Sometimes you just cannot play number 2 no matter what you do... quote] AUD is numerically such that 16 pip stop equates to 16*(1.49/.92) = 26 pips on EUR, and the smaller moves we are talking about on AUD are equivalent in percentage terms to the moves on EUR. This is important in the discussion on the viability of AUD trading with System II (which I do not doubt either). If AUD hard SL is being hit more than EUR, then this needs to be understood in trading AUD with System II

--- 帖子 #205 ---
That is why I am backtesting during my off times/down times. To get more of an understanding how AUD moves. Take for exampe this recent bull run on AUD, the runner, if you caught it from the bottom would have netted you around 10 pips i played number 1 properly (stopping out under the FCR or failure of HH breaking on second attempt), I dont trust AUD to save my life so I closed at +27 on this one. Now take a look at your runners in EUR and how they move, they not as whippy, just my humble observance. So what do we really need to do? We need to adjust our expectations and get a better feel for AUD, something backtesting is showing me (as well as forward testing). Nothing beats experiance . right, lets see if she wants to move on up again. [quote=John888;3252517]

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi en0x and John, Very true about stops - I have never taken a full loss nor do I intend to in the future But you have to have a max stop in order to put the correct size on. In that trade I posted before my entry was at 0.9177 (1 pip plus spread past prev high) with max SL set at 0.9161. Let me say this about the AUD and the way I trade it - I don't like putting on trades that have a max stop of more than approx 16 pips. If the swing high or low is greater than that I'll either take the trade and aggressively cut or sit on the side. We know it doesn't move as much as EUR, so all I am trying to do is turn that fact into an advantage.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Interesting Shodd Lets just make money guys, and kick ass and chew gum later. Do you have a perticular daily goal in mind?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Not really. I left behind daily goals some time ago as it interferred with my decision making process. These days I simply take what the market is willing to give (a well worn cliche I know).

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi, May I know what make you guys choose TF5M instead of TF1M/TF15M/TF1HR?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi, Because we learnt the 5 min time frame. We stick to 1 time to get a "feeling" for the market. You can trade it on the 15 if you want , and if your personality suits it trade it on the 1hour or 4 hour or daily really up to you, 5min is nice for my concentration level to be honest..

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Trade from today A) -1, this was a mistake trade. early monday ??? entered a market order instead of a limit order, closed as soon as I noticed it. stupid mistake B) traded this and got out above +21 when it started turning. Closed for +26 C) traded long again, for +14, I thought price stalled but I missread it and anyways... D)-1 price was moving too slow on the downside break for my liking E)entered the trade then wife wanted me to go watch the new twilight, instead of targetting +21 i set to the .50 mark, price missed it by 2 pips and came back down. By the time I came home it was +8 so I just closed it. Night all, until tomorrow total pips today +44 I think

--- 帖子 #212 ---
save yourself the pain, if your wife/girlfriend/partner asks you to take them to see twilight,just say no. trust me, you will save yourself 2 hours of pain

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi man! Just find your thread.. it's cool!!! As I can see - you make profits on solid base! Good job! Ps) Do you stiil need to have 9-5 job??? lol... You have a solid firma here in my opinion!!! Keep it going, man!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Morning folks. Lets see what the Aussie serves up today. A few thoughts for the day - Fear....discard it. You don't need it. If you have it you will lose. Grow a pair and get on with things. Do you know what you need to do to squash your fears? Overtrading.....saw a lot of it on the EUR thread last night. Lots of people getting chopped up by the chop, when all they had to do was wait for a qualified swing. Seems that it takes some a while to learn when to stay on the sidelines. Backslapping....see a lot of this too after each positive trade. I'm all for encouragement, but I don't believe it's healthy to be cheering every winner. All it's doing is making you more emotional (need I explain why this is bad?). Anyway, rant over....let's get on with it.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
No more squigglies just price action I like it!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Nice Rant.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
News in 3 mins. Shodd, good point about the backslap, but sometimes its needed for the newbies just like the rant fx gives when you complain about the losers. Both are needed to keep you on track. So I have no problems in encouraging someone. Sure , not ever 10 pip trade, but if catch a good runner then there whould be no problem in receiving a well done. Especially from those who count (eg. fx or feb). This is a means you are on the right track. The rest of your rant is good but that takes time, when to sit on the sideline, when to say enough is enough. I know you haev been trading a few years so its natural for you. Also, remember, EUR is not something to be picky about, FX takes nearly every setup and yet makes a tonnes because you just dont know when that runner will hit.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
You also should be backslapped if you do well at a loser, this is as equally important. Exiting correctly..

--- 帖子 #219 ---
We are long from 9245 chart attached

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Just wanted to talk about this for a min. I'm not saying people should scrutinise every setup, as that would be counter productive. What I am saying is use a little common sense when applying the rules. Last night was a good example. I saw lots of people trying to short a breakout of that bracket, when there had been no qualified swing low . Price had swung high into that bracket, so in my opinion the only valid entry was a long outside it. Seems to me that the practice of qualifying a swing has been forgotten a little in the rush to be in on everything. Febs method works because it is formulated from an understanding of the most basic of market mechanics (and the most important) - supply and demand. Ask yourself this: why does price make new highs or new lows? By the way, if my comments are unwelcome, please let me know. I don't want to confuse people - all I'm trying to do is float some knowledge out there to make people think and hopefully become better traders because of it.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Nice entry I waited till 92528 after retrace from 92507 broken by spread plus 1.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
BTW en0x - backslapping fuels your ego. Ego is a naughtly little thing most of the time.....it wants to personally own all of your winners (your winners become a reflection of yourself ie "how good am I") and none of your losers (it is the market that is wrong, not me). Practicing detachment from ego is very important if you want to do this job day in day out.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Shodd, Comments are always welcomed as long as they are not "if you add this EMA or this indicator" then why not discuss. I guess you are taking more the pure Feb method then the altered more aggressive FX method. FX will take the bracket breakouts and the key is limiting if it comes back into the bracket. He will never take more then a 10 pip loss on these but he has gained many more pips then lost on bracket breakouts on the reversal. arguments both ways are valid and its up to you on how to play them, end of the day I do not argue with what FX does and trust him fully, why? because I have traded live with him many times on chat those perticular braket breakouts you mentioned in your post(opposite to the swing) and watched him manage his loss effecticly and also watched him and been on runners on the reversal myself. However, by you saying waiting for the swing, is also valid but a slightly subdued method of what was taught.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
The post I made after the one I said this said it is equally important to get appluaded for exiting on a loss correctly. This therefore enforces that losses are not bad but part of the game. But like I said , you do have valid points.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
NMot sure if htese are nasty candles in AUD, still cant get my eyesight right with candle lengths, in AUD they appear huge for very little, however this retracement scared me to close at break even.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I am mad at myself already - I didn't trust my observation about waiting for the pull back from a bracket breakout at the start of the day. Still testing the observation though it seems right to me at the moment.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Put SL at swing low of AUD/USD and got taken out rats!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
en0x - re candle length......it's all relative.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I thought I'd enter beyond 9257 and 9230 levels. Any views welcome. cheers.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I have taken 0 trades as yet. I wait for the first pullback from the first qualified swing (I use min of 16 pips on the AUD). The entry some took around the 50 mark was not ideal as price had only swung up 10-15 at the time. Give the market a little time to show you want it wants to do.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Sound rationale John.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I take you you dont follow FX teachings? The bracket breakout is a very valid trade that I took. I played it accordingly to my plan with a very aggressive stop. Unless you completely ignoring what FX is teaching/taught then rather not say its not valid.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Which is fine btw , you dont have to trade the FCR1 BB FCR2 stuff if you dont want to and just trade the swings.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Shodd, we would have a qualified swing down now from 9255 to 9234? cheers

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Swing 1 so wait for pullback and break if it happens..

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Entered short at 9227.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
What is the next target, where should i put the stop??

--- 帖子 #238 ---
This is not a signal service. Go read system 2 thread please. As I stated in the first post , we are not a thread for newbies, if you dont understand what FCR1, FCR2 Bracketbreakouts are then I urge you to go read system2 otherwise you will just lose money. Please dont take offence, but this is not a signal service

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Taa942, I'm using a 16 pip stop from my entry, based on the play of watching the price, and exiting if it moves too far past my initial entry, as per System II. Target is whatever the market will give me, a double bottom will see me out, and looking left on my chart I will be wary around previous support level of 9214-9217. Right now price is stalling above 9218. cheers

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Sleepy AUD ... snooozzzee.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
And back on to system II trading. Sorry for the missed posts folks, had to do my real job for a bit..... John - what made you enter @ 27 rather than @33-34?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Got some good pips today. Market now in siesta mode!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Did you short at 9235 on the bracket brakeout? I sadly didnt which is not my normal case of trading so a little annoyed with myself. but good on you.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I set my sights on the earlier levels of 9257 and 9230, and anything in between was possibly going to be noise. The bracket between 9241 and 9237 was in the low market participation timezone and very narrow, so I viewed it as a lack of buyers and sellers, rather than a meaningful battle that leads to a proper bracket. So the break of 9230 was my entry. The was a swing down to 9233 prior to the narrow bracket, but it was too close to 9230 to warrant changing the entry level. All just my opinion of course! cheers

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Excellent.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Short @9198. Go bear down.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Very sleepy now isnt it , TKY is on lunch. Shodd, why dont you post trades when you hit them or post a chart? You seem to give advice but never put yourself n the firing line with your trades. are you trolling or trading this method?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I am also with you on this, from 9206 though..

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Stopped at 0.9209. -11 pips.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Me -6

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Should close trade on hammer candle at 5:05 GMT. Buy stop @ 218.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Trolling?? Hardly! I started to the other day if you remember, but that seemed to cause some confusion as I manage trades slightly differently (entry is the same). I'll happily post up my entries from now on......

--- 帖子 #253 ---
took it at 9213

--- 帖子 #254 ---
That would be great, post it . I knew that would get you to post

-12 stop hit.

--- 帖子 #264 ---

Another stab at this short @ 9205

--- 帖子 #266 ---
9170 is the baby to beat(yesterdays low) COMEON AUD make us proud Sl moved to break even.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Moved S/L at +1.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
S/L at +10.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Guys, I have closed this for +_35 as I am going home now, so see you later on this evening. Just a note here guys, some of you are saying to not play the BB, because you are scared basically of losing. Listen to this, we have a defensive play tested by FX called #2g+, play BB and PLAY THAT DEFENSIVE play. We missed a great oppurtunity for trading the short on the BB break at 9235 this morning. That was good for at least +21. Just think how your account would be if you grabbed it? So what, if you lose the occasional, just play the plan. It works and we can work it Seeya guys, will speak when I get home. This runner was a nice loss clearer(also will post my trades on a chart when I am at home) See you in about 2 hours.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Just add how much did we lose cause didn't played ping-pong.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
its quite funny, FX and I are pretty much the same mind about ping pong. Every time I damn try Ping pong it breaks on me..&gt; EVERY TIME. Tried it about 8 times... Even when its bounced like 3-4 times on a level , it then breaks as soon as I enter... No ping pong for me ever thanks I just cannot get into range trading..

--- 帖子 #272 ---
So how does Feb play it?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Set trailing stop to 50 pips and going to sleep. Hope to see couple of golden nuggets in the morning.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Good trading folks. Missed that last runner as I was out.....just the reality of real life getting in the way. Still ended positive for the day after capturing this mornings runner. Now on to the Euro...

--- 帖子 #275 ---
total 4 trades trade 1 : BE trade 2: -6 trade 3: -2 trade 4: +1 trade 5: +37 Total for the day: 30, slack ass work day to be honest. Attached is my chart, green is when I started trading, red is when I stopped. I stopped early tonight as I had to finish off things at work before going out with wife to dinner. i dont like leaving trades open , they cause me too much grief by constantly looking at my blackberry at fxstreet's mobile site to get price updates... not fun. Just a reminder, a BIG +21 I missed, stupid mistake ,take every trade. That was a risk of around 6 pips..... stupid mistake.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Not bad en0x. In fact I would say that's pretty good given you've finished the day nicely positive even after a less than optimal performance. Pat yourself on the back (LOL) and move on.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
So the market turned on a dime. He he.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Morning folks. Let's see what that AUD has to dish up today.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
"RBA Deputy Gov Battellino Speaks" Has given a little push to start with.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Morning all.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Looking for long above 08

--- 帖子 #282 ---
nice trades yesterday enox, i like how u summarise up all ur trades for the day, very easy to read and analyze

--- 帖子 #283 ---
More importantly, it gives me a reference to go back to. trendy days are easy to trade however its even more important to capture our end of day trades on bad whipsaw days. Its these days that sticking to plan is most important. It also allows me to share with FXachillies and get his views on them, something that to me is the most important and as he is a very busy man and I respect his time and EOD summary is far easier for his eyes to criticize . If you trading this method then go for it and do the same, use something like Jing project(a free screen capture tool) , works well for me.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Got filled at 075. A few hitting the bid at 14 and a few hitting the ask at 04-05. Content to let time pass some more before deciding to bail.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi chris - I am long at 9212 and will be playing a 2G+ on this one which will include a reentry order at the same level. I saw the swing price so I took the BB - today I will play by the book and spend a full session - I am developing my commitment to trade for a full session instead of a few hours. Of course price hits my entry and stops - I hate that -doesn't even give me a sense of success. and then stops right on the level line - ARGHHHHHHHHHHH LOL

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I didnt get filled, my fill is for 9214(9209 +3 +2spread = 9214)

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Again 04-05 level held, so this one is looking OK. Shouldn't say things like this though lol.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I took the more aggressive 9206 which was really a 123 entry instead of a BB.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Yeah I saw that, you should be okay still, your stops are now around 9200 level mark. Dont sweat the losses michael, end of the day this will work out but the important thing is to trade until you either loss your allocated trading amount for the day, or you get the runner. This is vital, to clear the losses. They happen most days. Typical trend following system (even in a 5 min ) Michael, ever watched and listend to Ed Sekoyta's song "whipsaw song"? Youtube it and listen to the lyrics .

I love that song and I watch it quite often to drill in his message into my head.

AU is going up but USDIX is going up too....so I think AU is going to fall sooner or later...

We reversed our roles here, I was in from 9220..

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Absolutely In a months time no-one is going to know what we're talking about lol. BTW have not re-entered, I need to focus on my primary system for now and don't have time to babysit another position. Good luck to those who are still holding.

See in your profile you live in Canberra? I guess there is not much else to do there but trade I still have yet to sneek a peak at the old capital

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Very true But Syd is not too far away if you want to do something. Berra is the best place to raise children in Aus in my humble opinion, so pretty happy here at the moment. I've always said to interstaters that it's worth a visit at least once, some of the national buildings are fantastic.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
We have no children yet. But if we start we will go to my wife's home country and have them there,(norway)so I best be a full time trader before then

--- 帖子 #305 ---
My SL is set to BE and I am still long, price didnt hit my intented "watch out" target of 21 so therefore I am waiting for an attempt at HH (if that happens) to decide on the exit.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
HH broken, watching 9250 psych level to see what she does.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Sed my friend, are yous till in this? This will clear out your loss if you did play the #2g+ properly So you dig it, as fx would say CAN YOU DIG IT? What you do? You PLAY THE MUTTA FUKKIN PLAN Sorry for swearing but FX rubs off on me

--- 帖子 #308 ---
break 50, break , it would be nice if 50 breaks we should make some good pips then

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Enox wich sysytem you trade and wich 50 you wait ?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Petar, Welcome to the thread. The thread is called System2(aud) and is based around what Feb layed out in the main system 2 thread and then what FX took and perfected and gave us a holy grail. Read the first post and there is a link to the thread. If you really want to get involved in this my advice is to read the whole of system2 thread (lots of posts but you will get the idea) and practice ont he EUR if you can. If you cannot be around for the LDN and NYC session then learn about it on the main thread and join us in AUD here We trade naked here, no indicators and on the 5 min. The 50 I am talking about is the 9250 psych mark, Not something I am targetting but 50 and 00 marks generally offer a possible turning point. Therefore I see it as a hurdle to break.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
PS. love the avatar Crazy pic.

Pats right back at ya en0x. Would have liked to have been back in at 36, but have to put food on the table and this method won't do that for me yet

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Closed for +24 , I am going to grab lunch. I didnt like it stalling that long at 51, I wanted it to move on some orders and get a clean break, but it didnt. so lunch time

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I got out at the 30 - I played the first entry as a 123 instead of the BB so I didn't play the 2G+ so all and all everything worked out. I got interupted for an hour cooking dinner and being with the wife so I can't watch the market. So much for my desire to trade a full session. Oh well wife is on my priority list. Will get back at it in a few.

--- 帖子 #315 ---

Morning folks. Short @ 12.

Unconventional trade, news went my way except got teachy and closed for +21. Will wait for a pullback if it happens

--- 帖子 #329 ---
higher low - reversal coming!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Still in. Stop moved to B/E. Am up a fair bit this week, so prepared to provide more breathing room over the next couple of days.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Still in.......recent swing fail to break previous high which is a bearish sign. Stop now moved to 90, so +22 locked in. Will consider closing early if this current swing down fails to break 62.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
And out at 48. Buyers started hitting the ask so knew it was time to book the profit. +64 for this one.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Short again from 42....

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Got one thing for you amte *pat pat* Heck, locked in +21, closed half at +38 and just leaving it Yesterday was a nightmare, I should post my trades, lost a total of -30 yesterday. I hate wednesday's. really i do , its my pay back to the market. Anyways, end of week matters. Wednesday is just my pay day back to the market for letting me trade

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Good to hear you're clawing it back today mate! Pats right back at ya. Short @ 42 now moved to B/E

--- 帖子 #336 ---
And out at 12 after the buyers stepped in again. +30 to make a total of +94 for today. That will do me, see you all tomorrow. Hopefully a few more will crawl out of the woodwork to share. Might start calling some of you trolls, as that seems to work

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Shodd, Would you be able to share some more light on what you mean by buyers hitting the market?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I expect two additional posters tomorrow , Paul M and Sedonapiper. We slowly building it, if its just me and you

--- 帖子 #339 ---
en0x - will respond to your question later this evening once things have settled down in the house

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Well the AUD has delivered nicely while the Euro is chopping up veges Anyway, I can tell through my broker on which side of the spread the last trade was transacted. By that I mean I can see when buyers are hitting the offer(ask) or when sellers are hitting the bid. When price reaches a level I believe to be important (previous area of S/R or round number) I watch the ticker monitor very closely to see if a stream of buyingselling starts in one direction. This can be a very early indication of pending reversal. It is an essential tool for my scalping. At present I like using it for this swing trading style because it often allows me to close at near the topbottom of a swing; meaning I am out of the market when a retrace happens. I find this advantageous for a number of reasons with little downside as I will usually be able to re-enter close to my previous exit if the trend continues. I'm reluctant to talk more about my exit strategytrade management as it differs from what is being taught by FebFX..... so I don't want to pollute this thread (or the main one for that matter). It also takes a really long time to get a good enough feel for the ticker such that you could base consistently good decisions off of. Happy to field specific questions via PM mate.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Good morning my fellow AUD traders. Lets see if today gives us some good green pips. Today I shall post my charts again , in real time. Im summary (not counting pips as I dont have time at the moment), this is what the week has looked like Monday Positive end of day Tuesday Positive end of Day Wednesday negative end of day Thursday Postivie end of day Friday??? Let seee Wednesdays are my bugbear with AUD it seems....

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Morning folks. Lets see where the AUD wants to take us today.

Greetings. Looking forward to your company - good to know others trade Asian market!

Oh yeah, short since 9122. Will explain later. p Price sitting on the 9100 mark

Stopped out at BE - but that was fun!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Back in @ 70

--- 帖子 #356 ---
And out again @ 06 for a very quick +64 LOL

--- 帖子 #357 ---
OK it's a little crazy right now. Might go out for a bit to let things settle down. See you in an hour or so.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Just broke low of 5 days ago. took a quick scalp. Nice 78 pips. That's it for me I'm off for a surf!! See you all next week. What a day.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Closed +124 . Done trading for the day already. now that was awesome trade , 1 trade 1 runner

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Crazy all right ! I got out when it bounced off .9000 +98 pips. I am off for a bit too. see whats happening in an hour or two

--- 帖子 #361 ---
On a side note, the credit crisis could be finally hitting us? http://www.reuters.com/article/newsO...5AP1L120091126 Our brokerage floor is very busy today(making HUGE amount of money mind you) because of dubai defaulting on a few bonds...

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I am back in short from 9049.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
In the same trade Paul. Good to see you're still looking for opportunities. This sort of thing is what it takes to make it in the business.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Yes i am regretting not getting some of the upswing. Can't complain though

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I wouldn't beat yourself up too much about that. The upswing was quite erratic and certainly not ideal trading conditions. Let's just worry about managing the current trade.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
A few buyers hitting the ask around 22-24, but not enough for me to bail on the position just yet. Will let it run for a couple more bars.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I prefer feb's statement on this matter. The market is a Saint Whore... it will take your pips as fast as you make them So I am out, made way more then what I wanted/need to make for the day. No point in being excessivly greedy.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
22 has been breached, now setting stop at BE even though @ 49 it's a bit of a sitting duck level. I think we'll get close to 00 before 49....

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I am looking to see how it reacts to the 9000 mark

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Fair enough En0x. I prefer however to make the proverbial hay while the sun shines - market is nicely trending today and it's very very easy to make pips. On these types of days I prefer extracting as much as possible out of them as it helps make up for the choppy or consolidating days.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Are you still in shodd. what do you make of this retrace ?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hmm.. stopped out at 9045. +4. I think i could have manged that better.... Thats me for the day. Have a good weekend

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hello guys what you think about AUDUSD now ? i am long but i dont know maybe that is not good idea ?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi Mate, Can you post a chart and the reason you are long? If you have a valid reason then sure, its fine to go long. You know the plan , trade it. I am out as I made more then enough today. Will fight another day on Monday

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I'm still in. The retrace is probably just the usual lunchtime reversal. Don't like where my stop is at, but will leave it go. Earlier thought about bailing at 14 while watching the ticker, but got distracted and didn't follow through. So will leave this one to either stop me out or bail when I see faster buying activity as per usual.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I will keep an eye on the tokyo clock next time. Nice tip thanks.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Yea i took trade based on M1 and M5

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Aaaand I'm out at breakeven. Did not manage this trade optimally at all. Not too much you can do when your 4 year old comes in wanting to play footy.... Hindsight will also demonstrate that the stop placement was poor also. Anyway, next....

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Not even going to comment

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Damn hi9ndsight enjoy footy ,one day I will hopefully be a full time trader and then I can get me some children

I have 5 children - do you want one?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi Petar, This post is no way intended to offend you. So please dont take it as such. Why do you have all these indicators and why do you trade the 1min? We trade in this forum what is taught in the main system 2 thread. If by using those indicators you are profitble consistently then carry on but if you trying to get there then my advise is this. Ditch all your indicators (except the time and news one, those might help). Leave your time frame on 5 mins, read the thread system2 so you know how we trade and come join us on our quest then. Just a suggestion. I trade purely on 5 mins without indicators other then marking massive points of danger(previous daily highs etc) which are there to watch and observe.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Geez you're keen!! I have 3 and that is more than enough! By the way Petar - I am not sure why you were posting your question in this thread, as it is clear you are not trading the methodology we do in this thread. I will give you one piece of advice however - asking others their opinion on your trades, especially mid flight is quite dangerous for your pysch and account balance. What if I responded with "well you must be a loony to be going long here"??? What would that do to your thoughts?? Nothing positive if you're the type that seeks external validation that's for sure (even if your position was valid based on your plan).

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Well folks, I'm done for the week. Have a good weekend and see you on the other side

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Guys I got another trip away next week.... so good luck with the trading. I hope to get back into it monday week. See you all then.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
What will this week give us?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Big gap up - could be a down move to fill that empty space but spread is still a bit wide for me!

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yup, higher than normal spread is a red flag for me. Sitting on the sidelines for a bit longer

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Spread with oandai s still 4 wide. Should tighten soon. Good morning all

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Good Job brother!! I quietly check your thread occasionally... Whenever my girlfriend is not buggin' I might join you in a couple of trades!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I have made several attempts at saying something important and all that seems to come out is crap - I am going to wait for the Toyko open and then set my orders - more than likely long at 9150 and short at 9107. Would like the spreads to tighten. I expect the market to attempt to fill the gap though 20 tics is not that large a gap. The first trade of the week is so interesting. My feelings are magnified because there is so much expectation for a good week to follow.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Morning mate (and everyone else ) This statement interests me. I love my job, it's a dream come true for me really. When I first started trading full time I used to find Mondays were the most challenging days. I would sit down at my desk so keen to get underway I would quite often make a bad decision or two before settling back to my plan. My emotive side would have control and it would take a couple of slaps in the face for my rational side to get back in the drivers seat! I've since rectified this problem but I just found it interesting to read that others may be facing a similar dilemma. Not sure what else I wanted to say now really LOL.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi Feb, I hope you had a great thanksgiving. Yes, woman , mine loves to talk to me about things like gossip when I am slap bang watching price.. still love her to bits though Lets see if Monday will do something, Friday was just wonderful , except the actual real news about Dubai was a little scary.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Thanks shodd - over time I have found that there are no new feelings when it comes to trading - yes I also go through the process of getting slapped a few times before I get in gear. My first decisions of the week seem wired from an old thought process and it takes a while for my updated brain to get involved. Example - I am short and all the old fears and thoughts came rushing to the forefront when the PA runs back up a few tics. My spreads are still larger than I like and I am curious how price is going to react to 9100. Because of this curiosity, I will have a trigger happy finger which will of course cut me short or I will choose to be tough and then watch price go against me as it bounces off the 9100 - oh how the mind works. Wicked.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Short at 91098 out at 91005.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
This is my dream , to do what you ghuys do (Feb,FX shodd etc) , tade full time. Not that I care about money, i just love trading a lot and have been. My goal is to become a full time trader, and then pay it all forward what I have been taught by Feb and FX and help others out too. Its been 2 years and few months since I first heard of the concept of trading FX and its been a journey (personal discorvery). I just find it amazing how much one learns about oneself through this journey. Obviously I am far from there but wow.. what I have learnt in the last few months .. Just a note, I wanted to speed up my "expectation" learning for AUD so I bought a backtesting software last saturday. I have tested 3 weeks worth of data from the 5th of Jan to end of Jan (and will test every down time I have) This was a manual backtesting btw, so I had to take the traders and exit them as I would normally. Good results so far (although backtesting is no indication of future performance ) but gives me an idea of how AUD performs. Starting account was 10K trading 1 lot, in 3 weeks the accounti s 14 460.. so, I do believe we can easily make AUD work, although noticing the runs are smaller but hey, I wouldnt complain if I could do that performance live. Will complete the month tonight and get another month out this week(and update this thread each "month" I complete.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Wicked indeed! It's funny what the mind does. Leaving aside the wider than normal spread (which is actually a real issue as you know that liquidity is down....but forget about this for a min!) this mornings setup is really no different to all the others we take and should be treated as such. But because we have built up expectation that we're going to have a good week, we place extra importance on getting away to a good start. Even though this trade should be treated on it's merits only (and not your expectations). So fear creeps up slowly to start, but when you get a few pips in the green you think "well here is the good start that I expected, can't afford to blow it now" and fear really sets in when price starts running against you. "Must not let this winner lose, must get a good start" See where I'm going with this? The way I deal with the Monday morning itches is to read a few choice words that I have written to myself over the years after going through exactly what I described above for the 1100th time. It's a great way to remind you of the importance of staying rational, especially when your enthusiasm to trade is at it's highest.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hey en0x. Keep up the good work! I have 5 charts running on my screen and focus on AUD as it suits this time zone but will take others that suit also. Just noticed that the trade I took on AUD was exactly half that which was available on Eur/USD in same time period but I wasn't concentrating - haven't had coffee yet! .. Pays to keep an eye open.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Spread has tightened up nicely now, so I'm looking to get in. I like short @ 93, but I'll take long @ 51 if I can get it too...

--- 帖子 #400 ---

Your insight helps alot and we shall see. By the way My first trade was for (-1 ) - price bounced off fridays high to hard and I went into survivial mode. I now have orders - long at 9138 off the FCR and test of it and low is 9090. I thought about putting it back at 9107. That is part of my "getting my head in gear" process - I like to cheat which of course gets me in trouble more than it rewards me.

this is a nice candle to see - was concerned after last candle had such a wick to it. Now looking for a #1 exit trouble at the next hurdle which I have at 9175.

But depends on if this breaks here, still stuck. No break yet

Why at 62 if you don't mind me asking please? THe big bear candle i assume?

Back in @ 715

I can tell you why, he got scared of leaving money on the table and bailed Sedona is still learning to control that emotion. As we all are

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Over it messing around at this level, closed for +37, not really like it sitting at this hurdle and farting around. Gave it enough time on the second attempt to break it. Going to get some lunch.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I watched candle action and was antsy - didn't play a #1 exit properly. I am satisfied and not at the same time - one of the aspects of trading - hindsight shows up immediately.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Ah so nice to have someone in my head - I am not sure you want to spend much time in there - and yes you are correct on what was going on in my mind. To give you some insight as to how tough this emotion really is. If you take a group of 5-6 year olds put them in a room with a marshmellow and tell them that if the marshmellow is still there when you come back in 15 minutes they will get two. Only 1 or 2 out of 10 kids will be able to not eat that marshmellow and wait for the unkown of two. This emotional dynamic is why it is so hard to trade at a high level day after day. At our core, we are really hunters and hunters take what they can get never knowing if tommorrow will bring them another meal or not. Takes great faith to overcome this emotion which only comes from experience.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Good post and too true. I feel like marshmellows now lol!! Short at .9151, long at .9178

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Out at 72 (pretty much breakeven). Last push up could not break through wall at 74-75 and I am mindful of the potential for a lunchtime reversal.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I only knew you did this because I have done it many many man times before, so has FX , so has pretty much everyone , and I still do it sometimes. Screen time comes into play, trusting yourself and expectation get dem marhmellows out your head.

.91750 seem to be a tough nut to break!

I used to trade futures. But now only forex with Gomarkets , all I see is their volume, a change from less than 90 to over 200 tells me something is happening. Don't know whether opening gap is a feed issue or not but I can see it on charts from 4hr down.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
No gap in Oanda (and that is excluding weekend data) , Shodd, you got a gap? Not that I am a gap trader.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Should have taken quick short my hunch was correct! Ah well. still learning!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
ok.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I'm with Go too, no gap on my charts.., stil holding from .9178

--- 帖子 #446 ---
If you want to trade with volume then trade currency futures. Otherwise its just guessing, really. Volume in OTC FX is tick based, but I am sure you know that and what indication is go markets? Are they primarily retail brokers or do they actually deal with the big instituional traders? Even if it was pure volume unless they deal with the people who move the market then I would judge what the "volume" in spot FX has to say. Have you tried an ECN broker? You can view the ladder on their or try Shodd's method (PM him and maybe he can help you if he wants to) but honestly, do you really need to? Closed my long for -1, will look for another trade in TKY lunch finish.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
There is a gap , I can see it on your charts. Big blooming opening gap. Nothing here on Oanda though

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Out for -8, failed to break the HH (probably should of waited for the candle to close, pre-emptive close)

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Oh yeah haha the big one i'm aware of, i thought there was a new gap just recently but yes definately this morning!!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
1 quick thing to add this, I dont do it because FX achillies knows what he is doing and makes enough dough to make most people look stupid and he doesnt use it. I want to be where FX is , not where the rest of the people that DO use things like "volume" in OTC providers and other indicators. That is not a dig, that is just my personal view.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
HAHAHA&lt; I was just about to applaud you for holding onto it , still testing there HH there. I bailed to early, at worst we should have bailed at BE or a little profit.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Thanks no problems.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hey people. Been a busy day today and haven't had as much time to focus in on the AUD. Someone was talking earlier about volume - in spot I wouldn't bother with it. The longs above 74-75 are looking OK now.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Guys, I have to run, need to clear up stuff before I leave work, got a lot of stuff to clear. Quick on though, promise to update with a graph later 4 trades +38 -1 -15 +12(had to close this early, need to do work for the big big boss: ( ) Total = 34

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Well that long should have been stopped out for breakeven. Who's short with me?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Finished for the day session, will look at trading the LDN swing, i need to get some work out , busy overflowing here

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Need to go be a Dad now. See u tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Morning all. Should be an interesting day ahead with lots of announcements that affect AUD.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Indeed

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Morning.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Shodd, Waiting around for Interest rates? See Tony abbot is lib leader.. agggh.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Market waiting for announcement? Todays range 25 pip so far. Could be sell below 9160. Thinking out loud to kill boredom.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
So tempting to take the short. perfect setup, except for 1 thing.. that interest rate in a little over an hour away...

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I was thinking the same thing - sometimes the best trade is to not trade at all.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
True but I'm in with tight stop.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Morning folks. Was long at 72 which got stopped out at breakeven. Now short at 59 (stop is only at 71). Rate announcements can do silly things to the market, so be nimble people.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I'm out for -5.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Ho Hum that cost me a few pips.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Long this time?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Yup am ready to go

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Man oh man, even the RBA news did bugger all to move the market so far.... SLLOOOOOOOW day. 1 trade for -3.. lol, I played ping pong then got scared.. I hate ping pong...

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I am down 8 and short at 9148 - lets see if it can get down to the 9120 area again

--- 帖子 #473 ---
in your back tests - have you noticed how price responds to a large single candle like the one we have?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Market has been on a crawl today, still have yet to see a trade. If it pulls backs and tries the LL I will jump in...

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Shorted at 9128... went to +16 now sitting at +3 and will close if it breaks here... SOOOOOOOOOOOO slow today.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
This short is seriously giving me the shits, will close at break even if it gets back there, otherwise closed. UPDATE, closed at BE. Market is crap today.. hope someone made money out of it..

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Fuck, this is annoying -20 and now in a short from 9119 FARKING AUD IS SHITE today

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I got bitten on the bum too! Tomorrow another day. Will take on the euro tonight to see if I can get ahead. Peace

--- 帖子 #479 ---
yeah tomorrow, I clawed my way back to break even after being down 50+

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Time to re-focus and re-load today mate.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Waking up to a bracket this morning

--- 帖子 #482 ---
That is too true , too true. Time to trade with a fresh head, thanks for that.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
That is some mighty fine trading on your part.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Actually not, I was trading completely scared... I wouldnt applaud it, I was ashamed of myself. Ended up closing the last AUD trade at midnight with a sigh of relief.. Tomorrow is a new day to sort my head out... I need to be where shodd is, cool , calm and just work focused.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
It's one of the most important things you can do. Today we should be aiming for nice clean breaks. Get ruthless and be nimble. I'm looking for longs above 60 and shorts below 36.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
By the way, ANYTHING in between does not get my business.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Long from the arrow, first hurdle the big red blob...

--- 帖子 #489 ---
In @ 60 on a nice clean break. Bit of momentum in this move, lets see if it continues....

--- 帖子 #490 ---
lets see if 9270 becomes the new area of support

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Out at BE. Next.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
That was disappointing - got out BE.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Out at BE too, but today is a tough one for me, staff xmas party tonight and was taken to lunch by a supplier (and two bottles of red later...) sooooo....... fark it, xmas comes around once a year and I hate wednesdays....

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Down 6 on the last break of the high - up 4 for the session -

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Market looks constipated , still short at 9264, see what happens.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
to pass the boredom - is this a fcr2 or a 123S set up? I have the same entry and am playing it as a 123s because the FCR2 had no momentum - comments?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
123s stop 9275

--- 帖子 #498 ---
thank you - I am getting bored with the slowness of this market starting to look at doing other set ups - not a good thing for me to even look at. Oh well.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Far out, this is painful.... market dead for NFP, what do you think Shodd?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
I am about out of patience -

--- 帖子 #501 ---
AUD needs some Metamucil I think Not sure whether the employment announcement is having an effect, as it is a fair way off yet. Just one of those days that demand is meeting supply (not much on either side having said that). Best strategy for days like today is to go do something else for the day. The key is to recognise these conditions ASAP.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I am getting into hope which is not a good place to be. So I am going to close out and quit for the day

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Are you in the short from 61 mate? If you are then your reason for exiting is not valid. Leave aside hope and stick to the plan you had before you entered.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Check out London session, might be some movement. today seems pretty dead. Maybe waiting for london like yesterday...

--- 帖子 #505 ---
short at 64 thanks for the reminder still in though its not meeting my expectancy very well

--- 帖子 #506 ---
out at -1 - when unable to breakthorugh 9262 took my #1 exit chance and said next

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Awesome! Massive slap on the back to you mate! That's about all the praise you'll get from me because really when you break it down, you simply stuck to your plan. Time to move on. Be nimble.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Thank you. I will gratefully take it - I wrote in my trading jounal this was a trade where with the help of shodd, I stuck to the plan which is worth a beer. With a suds in hand, I am going to stop and come back for the New York session. My hours for trading really suck sometimes. May miss out on the runner for the evening and if so - that's life.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Enjoy the brew mate. I'm off to ride my bike up a hill (so that I can go down it really fast). Might just have a beer myself when I get back.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Morning, lets see if AUD wants to do something this asia session or sit on its ass again.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Morning folks. Let's see what the AUD will serve up today. There's a mini series that has started airing on Aus TV in the last couple of weeks called "Band of Brothers". I know it's been out for a while now (I was in the States when it premiered in 2001) and I'm pretty sure it aired here in Oz some years ago. But I have not seen it before and after the first couple of episodes I am hooked. Perspective. The last couple of days has been challenging for some. I can feel it coming through in the posts. While watching Band of Brothers last night I was reminded quite brutally that we as traders should really keep the challenges we face in perspective. I'm not belittling the challenges that trading throws at you, for some they are great and others they will be insurmountable......but we're hardly jumping out of planes into a night sky so full of enemy fire that what should be black is orange and red. These soldiers not only managed to get on the ground through tremendous adversity and huge losses, they ended up claiming their objective and winning the day! The only way they were able to achieve their objective was by having a sound plan to start with. Then being sharp of mind to make the necessary on-the-fly decisions required to carry the plan out successfully. So, we're all here, about to start another day with an objective to achieve. It's nowhere near as hard as what those soldiers (or any others that have fought in battle) had, but we still need to have a plan, stick to it and use our heads.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Good post and yes, keeping it in perspective is a good idea. Thanks for the post.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Long @ 74

--- 帖子 #514 ---
already long on a morning bracket

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I am in with Shodd at 9274

--- 帖子 #516 ---
out + 8 oh well reload. This exit was because I didn't get in at the best level so when the news came out I was trigger happy and when price came back towards my entry I pulled the trigger. I am also remember FEB saying "if price goes in your direction for 10 to 20 pips and then retraces fast just get out and reload. So I did.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Closed +24, mucking around at this level to , closed.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
the value of a good entry my 8 and your 24. Your entry gave you more room to work than mine.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Closed at 92 after sellers really stepped in at 95-96. The 00 level might be hard to break.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
First time posting on this thread, but have followed it with great interest. Band of brothers is a favorite of mine also. The immense and atrocious situations these men were put through is unimaginable. I respect them wholeheartedly. War is the the worst side of mankind, but unfortunately sometimes necessary. Ennox, I have followed feb's thread from the beginning and read all of your post. I am in the same situation as you being on the east coast, going into work at 5:00am and off at 3:30pm. I cannot stay up 24 hrs a day and have no access to a computer at work but will somehow work it out. FX has changed my thinking about trading for the better. Will participate in this thread if you will allow me. by the way, I was long at 1.9242, out at 9282. Tks

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Welcome aboard mate. Can I ask why you went long at 42?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi and welcome, lets do it

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I have an order at 9299 for a long. Yes 9300 is a tough one to break but everything must break eventually...., will play a very hard #2g+ on the trade though.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
9300 is not breaking it seams.... hoo hum....

--- 帖子 #525 ---
AUS/USD chart

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Ok this is what I hate price closed iside the level and then the next candle sits just at the level line - this time I closed for a -2 feel like I ripped myself of though with a possibility of a runner but the plan is the plan for a reason - I am trying to remember the last time price actually took off after it closed inside the level line. No where is the reenter 3 above the last candl high?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hey Sedona, On my chart the level line is at 9294, giving an entry price of 9299. The bar closed on the entry line after dipping only one pip below it. As FX points out to us, the market knows the level line, not where we enter. We should watch carefully as the price goes below the level line, and give it 3 pips room to move under this line. Is that you saw on your chart? cheers

--- 帖子 #528 ---
You did well, i didnt close it as wasnt at my desk. Important part of #2g+ is yo be there to trigger it

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Thanks for getting back to me Sorry for the delay - wife had to see me at the moment I was going through my angst - and it couldn't wait - It could have been any time but the universe liked it to be at that time. - murphy's law. I am also not in this short trade - my level line was 9296 - I took the higher high. Thank you for the 3 pip room, I usually give it room but it's nice to have a number for reference. The real question is the reentry part of the #2G - where do you reenter - new high or previous entry?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Anyways, closed this trade for -10 total today so far... 2 trades : +24 and -10 Running tally is well +14 but there is still an awefully large time left to trade

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Afternoon folks. Second trade for today - short @ 82

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Closed the short for a whopping -10...

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I had a long in at 09296 ,. which triggered and hit TP of 21 while I was on the bus. Who says things arnt supposed to break

--- 帖子 #534 ---
price has been bumping at this level for 2 days lets see if it will break through today.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Morning my friends, Remember tonight it NFP night, lets see if we can some cash before the big event Paul, you gonna trade NFP tonight again mate?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Good Morning All Back early from my latest trip away. Looks like a nice 123 forming short

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Yes indeed !

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Morning folks. Having platform issues this morning, so may not be trading today.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
you will be missed

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Make that a bracket

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Long at .92433

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Out at BE

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I got in long off the break of 9244. Held through the small retrace but got out for -3 when it failed to break the HH

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I am in short off the FCR at 9243. A bit risky but paid off this time. Will exit if it bounces off 9231 (recent bracket bottom)

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I was with you my friend, entry was 9238 for me

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I am in as well at 38 -

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Closed for +18, price dicking around at this LL, reentry at 9208 in case it continues.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Out +19, Time for lunch

--- 帖子 #549 ---
out plus 17 -

--- 帖子 #550 ---
I am a lazy bastard need to post my charts more often. Chart from the two trades so far,.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Good Morning A choppy start to the day. My spread is currently at 6 pips ( go markets ) so i will be sitting back until we get a bit more liquidity in the market

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Morning all, ready to go after having Fri off. BTW Paul - what is your normal spread?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Between 2 and 3 for AUD. It has come down now to 3.5

--- 帖子 #554 ---
That's not too bad. Short @ 47 btw

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I am out for an hour or two. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Back now..... still choppy

--- 帖子 #557 ---
That spike up and down might have been news induced. I am going to set orders above/ below the new bracket at 9145 and 9163. Shodd, Enox what do you think

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Long now from 9169. A little late (making my son a honey sandwich). Could be a fakeout, we shall see.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Dumped it -8 (2g+)

--- 帖子 #560 ---
In short now from 9154 off FCR at 9157. Small RR, lets see. Update... out at BE appears to have bounced off bracket bottom. Worth a shot due to low risk (tight stop). I am out for today.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Morning folks. Decided to forgo a lot of the session yesterday after my first trade was stopped out at breakeven as nothing was happening. Feeling pretty tired; this has been my first year of full time trading and I'm starting to feel like I need a break. So, will power on through this week but will probably stop for several weeks after this. I'm the boss after all

--- 帖子 #562 ---
We have a boss in the house - how cool is that!

--- 帖子 #563 ---
LOL, well maybe not your boss, but definately mine!

--- 帖子 #564 ---
BTW long from 32.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Mate, I am envious of you. Hopefully with your gauidance I can dot his one year

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I'm around for the long haul, to help where I can mate BTW the long @ 32 is doing OK.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Its been a struggle the last two weeks during the day.. Feb did warn us about Dec.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
short at .9147, BB

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Out at .9137, +10, i know i shouldn't have exited by like this, but have to do a few other things today. cheers

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I am in the long at 0.9050

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Stopped out -12

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Nothing wrong with the pattern mate, just a touch early in the day. Probability of a sustained move is not great right when you entered, as NY is almost closed and Syd hasn't opened.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
will hold my horses until Syd open then.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
wonder if the market will be listless until after the news in an hour and a half.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
short at 9043 playing #2

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Was the entry at 9043 based on a break of the halfway point of the big green candle at 9.05 AESST? cheers

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Short at 9028. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Low of this level, plus spread plus 2 pips.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
stopped out with +5 for the house, now long at 9040

--- 帖子 #580 ---
stopped out breakeven on last trade. Looks like range time now.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Just an observation, looks like the asia has been quite the last week until the close then picks up nicely on ldn start... anybody noticing this?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Asia is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.Sometimes it breaks hard, but most of the time it sets a range and London breaks out of it.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
mumma used to say...

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Finally, long....9061

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Fakeout, -10.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
sweet - was in on the 123S break at 9109.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Where did everybody go, what happened Ennox, Shodd?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hey mate, I'm on holidays now until mid Jan. So no trades for me. I'll be around the boards for a little while longer until some much needed "no screen time" at xmas. Have a good xmas and ny everyone.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I am on my way to Hawaii for the holidays - will get a rare chance to trade the london market at a decent hour. Expect to be back at it after the new year. I was short from 42 today and just closed.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Stopped trading AUD until Jan. XMAS here we come

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Yea I guess it is time to do something else, market seems thin. Hawaii, you are lucky, always wanted to go there one day. Take care, Merryxmas!

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Short..... 0.8859 entry.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Most annoying&lt; i cannot seem to overwrite my charts :-/ Anyways, short on the BB @ 8860...

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Going to try post this chart. Closed +38.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
AS promised, the chart.. Hope it explains it a little.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Guys, I have been off trading UJ the last couple of weeks. I seem to flip between the two when movement is slow on one of them , it moves on the other normally. if you trade UJ just make sure you position size accordingly. 10 pip move in UJ is pretty large so you can make 1:1 around 14 pips(take into account spread). Hope that helps those who have been trying to squeeze blood outta AUD the last two weeks. UJ has been making me pips during this constipated AUD early Asia session.. except today , both made me good pippage.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Long on BB, playing no #1, looks like it wants to test the level line currently

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Good morning all, Welcome to the new year. Spread is still wide on AUD to trade. Will wait until its tighter.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Here is to a profitable year to all. I have been rereading the irony thread over the holidays. It was fun to read FX's first post and to see his development as a trader over the past year. Very encouraging to say the least. I still have a lot of pages to work through and am looking forward to the completing the task I set for myself. I will be posting my trades on my trading journal. Right now my first order is long 8903 and short 8984. The short is being aggressive.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
BUMP! Would be good to see this thread stay alive for 2010. I'm still having a crack at the aussie dollar during the day anyways, bracket for now..

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I have pending orders at 9321 and 9305

--- 帖子 #602 ---
See you all on Monday ready for action. Refreshed after a nice break and keen to get back into it

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Good Morning All, Shodd, are you still around?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Morning, Long at 0.8634 SL now at 0.8625 Attached is graph.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Enox good to see you back

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi and thanks, been a busy January , got back last night from New Zealand. Man oh man, that is god's country isnt it? I see Shodd is around , lets get some of his mad insight into AUD and see if he can assist us in taming this beast.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Still on the long, moved SL to break even. Updated chart attached

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi Enox, I only found Feb's System 1 &amp; 2 a few days ago so I haven't been able to read it all yet. Obviously i'm not ready to be of any use for your thread as yet, but I'm working on it. I am trading the basic Feb idea of 20/21 at the moment and so far so good.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Closed for +9, Short set to 0.8640.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
chart.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Shorted and got stopped out at -20.. I am outta practise on pulling the trigger here... Chart attached, arrow is where the short was, red is where I closed out...

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I never updated this but by the time I stopped trading AUD and moved into EUR I was up for the day after a trade in AUD that cleared my losess and put me in front. Will try keep with the program of showing this. Got a bracket top at 8795. I have a long order above that to play g+ defensive on a bracket breakout. Blue square is the pending long order. Seems like everyone who started trading AUD with me has not come back? still enjoying the lovely sunshine we are having down under? Coffee time

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hey Chris, yesterday was a nice ride on AUD, only problem was I had to pull out at 5.30 pm to go do school things. Watching now to short below 774. Or above 794. cheers

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hello John Good to see you back, yes it wasnt bad. Lets see if she wants to move, its news time soon so maybe that will push it over the edge. My orders are pretty much the same as yours. Top side of the bracket is certainly confirmed.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Short entered but not looking good. Filled at 8772 and playing g+ here.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Chart

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Short at 771, out 780, let's see what happens next.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Closed at 79, reentry placed at 8766. Oh hum.. slow day today..

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I want to change this topic. I trade UJ too, not sure if you want me to start posting charts on UJ, let me know what you think. UJ can be quick tricky, also remember if you trade UJ to position size accordingly, 10 pips in UJ is quite a lot of pips..

--- 帖子 #620 ---
FARK FARK FARK.... I forgot to pull he order for the AUD long before the news, with the spread widnening to some silly amount it clipped me in... Ouch... now down -24 straight off the bat.. Farker . Hmm , now to clean this up somehow.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Just been looking at U/J, looks like has good structure today, have you been trading it much during our session?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
It can be tricky. Very good at reversing and going hard and fast in the other direction. can catch you off guard. Trying to figure out how to get out this bloody AUD deal, the top end is holding and I am still -12 down from that fucking long at 8800........

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Didn't see your note on 8800, how are you playing it?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Its called the kneel and pray method.. I am kneel and praying this fucker will let me close down with as little as loss possible, seems like I am gonna have to bite the bullet and take the whoop ass for my mistake any minute now. But right now, the market has stalled, yet again... Damn asia is boring as feck.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
H chris, I am rereading the irony thread and just ran accross your posts on feeling like giving up - been there. I have chosen to stop trading until I finish the thread for the 3rd time, keep picking up little things I missed that I needed to understand. In the mean time I am not trading until I finish the thread and my trading manual is updated. Not sure when I will get back to trading because the trading hours here suck big time. Will find a solution to the time of day problem soon.

I feel your pain. Trading times here suck big time too, we are on the opposide sides of the world maybe I should make a move to Europe.

I trade the UJ sometimes, hard to go for runner due to its spiky nature imo. Thats what's good about the AUD, because of its low volatility when it does run, it usually does so smoothly, as evidenced by yesterdays pa, it's a shame those days are rare tho

bracket orders for now

Hi Skris, Yes thanks for your input, UJ is quite a weird one and AUD runners are rare.. oh hum.. always said that Monday and Tuesdays are great for Asia trading, do you find that was well?

Hey enox, Couldn't give an accurate answer on that one, i know i have been murdered on fridays quite a few times Current shorts are looking good now though, i probably should have went short on the fractal at .8776, but played it safe and when at 8762 Edit: closed short for -3, looked like a weak break, gonna duck out for a while, will be back to trade e/u for london

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I couldn't participate with you guys, lost power for 3 hours. Lets see if I can get into this downward move somewhere, Otherwise will look into E/U prior to London session. cheers

Today was definatly a target day in Asia.... SOOOO BORRING..

Closed for +25 on this trade. Waiting for LDN open for EUR trading. Would have been a good day except that WTF mistake I made earlier on.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Chart from the winning trade. I am not going to include a chart from the fuck up trade. It was a mistake and one which I wasnt careful of. MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE YOUR ORDERS WHEN HIGH VOLATILE NEWS COMES OUT. Whats worse, this is not the 1st time I have made a simple error like that before. Anyways, tomorrow is another day, I have lost all my gains I made yesterday.. could ave been worse.
