iHarvest Renko Strategy Hello campers Here is my way of trading RENKO small trends during the morning hours of Europe market and during NY open. This system is very profitable and can be traded by most people that have the required discipline. The rules: Check that you have a established trend using visual confirmation. This can be done on the H1 and the 6pip renko chart. See Post 13 Look for entries close to the hour (8 am 9 am 10 am...13,14,15,16) Always place a SL below the last swing and make sure the TP is bigger or equal to the SL Try to trade live micro lots so that you actually learn something.... Never ever ever pay for an EA as the only person making consistent money is the owner! Overview of trading RENKO using start of European session Here a summary for this year using a small live account. Still testing lots.... see below the latest and last update. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Some videos from my Youtube .... Two sell trades .... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Renko Symbols and brick size EURUSD 2 pip GPYJPY 3 pip AUDCHF 3 pip MA's 12,24,36 all exponential Heiken_Ashi 8,5 Trend MA 130 Guppies (standard settings) To download all tools and indicators go to my renko tool thread . or here the link to my google drive . Don't be confused by the name Titan trader. I am trading with a friend of mine (Stefan... he is a swiss trader.. real swiss, not an import like me :-) . Great guy and he trades reversals using some automated tool that I developed for him. All of the stuff is in the install plus a clean MT4 that can be use optionally) Posting to thread is restricted due to the enormous amount of highly intellectual entries.... it confuses me and also threatens my (in)sanity. Discussing actual trades taken can be done using the link below and is open to all that have a brain and have decided to use it :-) https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=743756 BELOW is WORK in PROGRESS Patterns that will display alarms in the GuppyCandlePattern Indicator WorldChange: When the price moves form one side of the Guppies to the other side Hook: Three down and one up (It is valid only if turn around candles stay within the Guppies Sprint (3 fast candles with very little volume) Attached Image (click to enlarge) =================== LAST UPDATE DUE TO MY ACCOUNT BEING HACKED BY SOME WANKER !!!!! ======== This month was a good test with a medium size account. 50K was the starting balance. It went up to 85K but as we all know, the market can suck up earnings in minutes... My last advice to all: Stick to a plan for your money management. Let winners run. Look at the stats. only 50% of all trades are winner BUT the average winning amount is 4 times higher than my loss. Trade with the trend..... I am out of this for now Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here the latest renko chart with colour candles. Attached Image (click to enlarge) See below for entries in purple Attached Image (click to enlarge) Remember that after the full hour it becomes interesting to trade for us scalpers. Small microlots give you experience in every aspect of trading and the losses are good lessons... once you learn to win, then increase trade size. Now some of you will laugh... microlots... what a "Depp" (means moron in German), but there is a saying: People who think they are too big for small things sometimes are too small for big things.

Gday bill After 15 years of working in the liquidity programming for various banks and funds, I can not explain all this in 30 lines but I have this to say: I am building a small trading platform to trade my own funds using renko as a basis. (Initially on MT4, in the long run must have FIXAPI access) I will have a cockpit for closing losers, winners, shorts and longs etc etc The cockpit will connect to multiple slaves (Renko charts with an EA that actually takes order entries) My main time to take the entries is during high liquidity. ( remember that my old job was mainly to fill orders, therefore my knowledge on spikes and slippage is second to none :-) ) Entries will be executed simultaneously on several pairs that show a short term trend. (bucket concept even so my EU and GU pairs are so correlated..) Total lots open at anyone time will never exceed 160 lots or 16 orders, that is the plan (order cluster is the plan but need to investigate over then next week. My live test account is 50K and am not sure what liquidity pool I am attached to. I flew over to meet with my broker ( GoMarkets ) and they actually are connected to SAXO for their LP... home territory . Currently my entries all are based on following the trend or getting in on a trend reversal. The reversals are clear to me as I can tell if a reversal point makes sense or not. Sounds arrogant... I know, but I really know where the orders are there and why. I love trading when markets move from xx.80 to xx.00 in an uptrend or from xx.20 to xx.00 on downtrend When pivots and round numbers (00,20,50,80) match, they are to be taken seriously. I never ever ever trade news I never ever ever trade without a opinion of the market During the morning, I will only trade when the market does what I expect. I look back on the last 3-5 trading days to make up my mind what happens during London open. Most of the time NY is purely technical trading. Currently I focus on EU,GU,UJ and UC due to spread. ... and I like dark charts :-) My eyes are quite sensitive and I prefer the dark to bright lights...sorry. I am using this FF mostly for a guy called Stefan, so he will be my first guinea pig. Jokers aside, he is a mate and he will run the trading center when I am not around. The threads from SonicR and HMAOUI are very good and can be taken as "food for thought". Most of the other threads are total utter garbage... but many good intentions. Hope this helps... need to go to bed. 2 am in Switzerland. Not sure where you are .. .but good night. PS: Nice to see that there are people with a high impact rating being able to post :-) And where did I get the initial idea... 2 ideas: One was by watching traffic (on the highway and after lunch ..toilet traffic) plus one of the guys I worked for traded trend follow and reversal points. Up to 6 trades in a setup, 50 Mio each... 8% of his account. I saved him 10s of thousands as I improved the fills (less slippage). Unfortunatly I was not so interested in the actual strategy. My job was to fill as close to market price on entry and exit....and in these circles asking questions is not the way to keep a job.

Thank God it is Monday.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Clean and straight forward. Had some help from some tools under development. iHarvest "take first trade after the hour". Worked out well... not always the case but often. Please note the distance the obvious resistance and supports and the lower lows higher high patterns. I have received many PMs... thanks but it is too time consuming. I will post the final version as I said once I am 100% sure. Download from links in post 1, watch youtube and practice 0.01 lot size live. It can be done with the right tools. Also I have been asked to join some education communities... WTF? Answer: NFW There are lots of sites selling education such as https://theforextradingcoach.com/ , expert4x,com etc etc... I made the mistake of giving my email once to see what they are all about and I am getting daily "updates.. win for sure... "my biggest secret" "Five years ago I was a farmer!!! the one with the farm(er) is one of my favourites... I bet he had a sheep farm... and now he is still farming sheep. DON'T fall for this. All these guys are nice and look like they have what it takes. Very few of them do, sorry to say so. If some of the people that I have mentioned are rich and sell their education to finance an animal sanctuary, then accept my apologies. Trading is a combination of psychology, knowledge and tools. Reading some books is cheaper and better. Reading is a way of learning, much better than youtube or FF ... one remembers it better. But I am old guy believing in the knowledge of books rather than instagram etc ... When I was young, I listened to the Pistols....Never mind the Bullocks! Great album! Now my oldest daughter is embarrassed as she thinks I am old fashioned. Sid Vicious is long gone....

Really!!!!! Almost free... You must be kidding me... Is really anyone dumb enough to click this link? To me it would be like sticking a shower hose somewhere where it does not belong. If you are even tempted to click, go and look in the mirror long and hard. Whoever you see tell him: Stupid is what stupid does! Good old Forrest Gump... he would have made a good trader.

Buy the EA for 300 USD and you will be sooooooo rich....only for you... so great Attached Image (click to enlarge) THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH. The below link is IMO a good way to start. Serious and honest. I am not involved in any shape or form and get no kickbacks whatsoever.... but that is a serious approach. https://cmtassociation.org/chartered-market-technician/ Even what I am doing here is no way to get to know real trading, it is more of a documentation of what I am doing. It would be naive to think that you will be a millionaire after 6 weeks starting with 50 bucks...

18:00... and I find 3 good setups. EURUSD: The first one is a clear break of the 20 price line going towards 50.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD Quick entry... went better than expected. Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDJPY I entered this one at a risky level.. and during the pullback I got scared. Still dont have my emotions under control Attached Image (click to enlarge) Last but not least. The reason I use GoMarkets: Look at my latency times.... 3.16 milliseconds is not bad....Please note that fills over a certain size will still experience crappy delays due to the nature of the LP from the backend provider. When working as a FX caterpillar, I was very very happy with under 5 milliseconds trade execution. For that to happen, one needs a good connection. Mind you, the EA delay on MT4 is about 50-80 ms based on my experience. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Below is an example of a liquidity pool of 10 million from the FIX API backend. When placing orders with over 20 to 40 lots, one needs to be an expert as otherwise the shower hose ends up up your xxx. Below shows a trader taking 45 lots in two separate trades on a Liquidity pool of 100 lots showing the refill rate of 10 lots per 30 seconds..... most of you will not understand this, but that information will show to some people why FX can only be made into a multimillion dollar business when all the factors match.

How to prepare for your trading day Open the hourly chart and look at the market sessions for the last 7 trading days. Determine if there is a up trend, down trend or neutral by using an 21 EMA. Look at the patterns for the last 3-4 days of the European session and see if there is some commonality. Note down your impression for EU,GU,UJ and UCAD on a piece of paper using 3 columns (instrument, H1 Direction, Renko) Now confirm this by using a renko chart using a box size of 6 pips. Note this in the 3rd column Last but not least: Check for news or any speeches by FOMC members Example EU, Down, DN GU, Undecided, UP etc etc Assuming that the 2 columns agree, then trade in that direction and only in that direction from 8 am until max 12:15 (lunch time Central European Time) And the most important rule of all: If the market does not agree with your analysis, don't take a trade. The above is essential and should be taken as gospel. If you can't do the above, you lack discipline and direction. I talked today to a smart german trader working for a investment firm. He confirmed that when educating new traders, most will not prepare properly for the day and when they are wrong, start chasing trades instead of not trading. Don't make it more complicated than you have to. Round numbers are the tension points in the market and nothing else really is needed. Looking at the left structure will show you the rest. Stick to your plan and give yourself a pad on the back for not trading when the market and you don't agree. Can you make money trading this way... that is actually up to you as you must execute the trades, decide what to do, how to manage risk and how well you know your tools. Without good tools, no money honey

Today a trader from one of my favourite cities "Berlin" took the following trade(he gave me permission to publish this trade): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at the perfect discipline of this trader: He did his daily analysis (he does it his own way) and was GU short. At 8 am GMT he was ready and saw a clear break to the down side There were also lower lows over the previous hour The 80 level was broken and did not act as support any longer. The price was on the way to the 50 level.... Look at the perfect entry - German skill and precision! Well done! 15 pips means 1% for the day. Can you do this? You bet you can but only if you adhere to the P's theory of the army: Preparation prevents piss poor performance... PS: Just got another feed-back:

Hi, where can I download the latest Renko IHarvest strategy. In the strategy author's first post there is a link to Google Drive, but you must have permission to download it. Thank you in advance for advice

Reversals are easy to see using the attached half trend indicator (without the channel). Renko is best for sure. This chart shows $1 Renko bricks

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Hutch, I really like Renko bricks, but they are cpu intensive and I find I can only run 3 or 4 Renko charts before it locks up my vps. tks, cdk

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I have used a commercial one from Ovo which is cheap @ US $45....I have used this one for a long time and no problems running multiple brokers on dual monitors per computer...I have tried most Renko EA,s in Cyber space....Just my own experience.. I have been using Renko for approximately 18 years ,however I continue to run Candle charts as well......Starting to wonder where the time has gone A nice 102 pips last night on this pair.We all know the markets have been slow during these trying times but shows some sign that things may improve but that is just my humble opinion...If scalping then there is always money to be made but as we all know the risk is higher.

Trade with renko bricks. Have fun with trading and reduce stress... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
No stress trading Renko for sure it's easier than baking a pie You can even trade with only 1 indicators the MACD; above the zero line buy below sell. The arrows are from the EMA crossover 3,4 and are not essential but give a nice signal. The attached chart shows the trades for the last 2 days for GBPJPY .

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Good to see people succeeding with their own variation of Renko charts. R

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi, how are renko bricks calibrated?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Best is to try different Renko brick sizes for the asset you are trading picking the best for your style of trading. If you want to use a MACD as the trade trigger you also have to try different settings to see what is best with the Renko brick size you chose. The GBPJPY chart I posted yesterday had a Renko brick size of 10 pips and this works well with using the Fx Bay MACD with a setting of (4,3,0) to trigger a trade. This setting works on all currency pairs using a Renko brick size of 10 pips. For low ATR pairs such as the EURUSD it's better to use Renko bricks of 5 pips since the price goes up and down a lot but I don't trade low ATR pairs because there isn't enough good trades. 10 to 15 pips Renko bricks are good for medium ATR pairs, basically all GBP pairs. For high ATR pairs such as the DKK pairs it's best to have 20 pips or higher Renko bricks size.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks for sharing so clean. What would you recommend for a 5 brick set up in terms of MA cross over and MACD settings. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hey Hutch, what renko indicator and pip size were you using in this image? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I was using the STG Renko Chart indicator to create a 10 pips Renko chart. If you choose to also use the STG Renko Chart Remote indicator you can change the number of pips on the chart without going back to the original M1 chart. Here are examples. The first chart is the original 10 pips Renko chart shown above but this time with the STG Renko Chart Remote indicator at the bottom of the chart. The second chart was obtained only by changing the number of pips from 10 to 5 on the STG Renko Chart Remote indicator. The third chart was then obtained by changing the number of pips from 5 to 20 on the STG Renko Chart Remote indicator. Try the STG indicators and I'm sure you will like them.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
The answer is in my post above Basically the settings for the EMA cross and the MACD are the same. Looking at the 5 pips Renko chart you understand why I don't trade low ATR pairs because you get too many lousy trades. The 10 and 20 pips Renko charts produce less trades but they are much better than the trades produced by the 5 pips Renko chart. Out of 10 signals produced by the 5 pips Renko chart 4 trades were good and 6 were lousy

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you very much for explaining I noticed that the indicator "2MA Crossover" repaints and thus not all crossover are valid signal. How do you filter bad and good signal?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I never seen it repaint after candles closed. In any case you have to use the best indicator that you have. It's called your eyes

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Fair enough

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Was it repainting in the middle of an active bar or after one or two bars have closed?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
This one correlates exactly with the MACD...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I am thinking that the 3/4 cross is still so opportunistic a signal on the 5 bricks chart, it only requires a conservative filter to weed out some but alas not all the false signals or "fakeys". I have put some tools together to try and achieve this because sometimes you have to trade the low ADR pairs because you cannot afford the number of pips stop loss you have to risk on the higher ADR pairs. You get more fighting chances even with the higher probability of lossing signals. So I added Trix candles and a sort of MACD both on default settings with the 3/4 cross.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thanks its looks very good what are the other indicators shown on chart if u can share which can show the trend Thanks

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thank you Intrepidpips for your Renko 5 pips system. You are entirely correct about using 3/4 cross with Renko 5 pips bricks along with the xb4d as filter. Attached is a GBPJPY 5 pips Renko chart using the full xb4 system and cross 3/4. With all the 3/4 crosses it's nearly un-tradable. However, if the trader only uses the xb4d filter as entry and exit there are only 2 trades. The first one between the red vertical line and the aqua vertical line generating 99 pips and the second trade from the aqua vertical line generating 85 pips. Please note that I never traded the xb4 system using Renko but it might be something to think about

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I trade Renkos also and you dont need a indicator for entrys with renkos....I use 3 indicators to determend the short term trend and enter first trade at the flip of the indi called "The secret trend reversal" and that the nonrepaint fisher and Woody also agree with direction of trend on the rest of the entrys i enter on second box and dump half the possision after one box "6 Pips" move stop to BE and let the rest run until i get a closed box against me also i use a stop of 1 box again 6 pips....On screenshot you see 6 entrys from 15.30 to 19.30 give and take....This is all you need i post the 3 indis under here..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I just took time out to backtest the xb4 indie on M1 it looks legit no repainting after candle close. I hope to see it live on Renko tomorrow. Keep raising the bar my friend, we will milk this cash cow together.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Just watched the xb4 indie on a 0.1 pip renko chart and it looks like it repaints unfortunately. I think a cross system works well with renko. Just got to play around and find the right settings.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I have been milking the herd of cash cows for years However I got lazy so 85% of my trades are on D1 charts.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
It repainted after the candle closed (deleting the arrow after the next arrow formed in the opposite direction on the next candle), which it looked strange since once the EMAs cross, it crosses...there is no meaning in repainting that. Probably it was just my terminal which stuck and didn't delete the arrow before the close of the candle. I'm observing it now to see how it behaves.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
It repainted on me in real time, think I should just use the MACD colour change instead.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Alas the xb4d indicator repainted on me in real time, so will work on a combination of indicators as filters.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Let's see this one performing in real time.

Normally there are two main reasons: 1. Not enough M1 candles. To get more M1 candles keep pressing "Home" and you will get more M1 candles. 2-3 days of M1 candles is enough to get a good Renko chart; or/and 2. Your choice of Renko bricks is too big for the number of M1 candles that you have. I mainly trade GBP pairs using 10 pips Renko bricks.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
1. On your source M1 chart put the STG Renko Chart indicator. In the input tab write 67 f or "Offline Timeframe start" to get a chart named M67. C hoose False for the "Show the wicks of candles" and no wicks will be shown except when a new candle is forming. 2. The Fx Bay MACD setting of 3,4,0 is good for currency pairs (I prefer GBP pairs), CFD's or stocks. 3. You can have a normal t imeframe chart and a Renko chart for the same currency pair. You can use a H1 chart to produce the STG Renko charts by choosing the timeframe (last option on the input tab). You have to make sure that you choose the template for your timeframe chart before you apply the STG Renko chart. Here is a H1 DAX chart with an Ichimoku template and the STG Renko chart indicator and the produced DAX Renko chart with a value of €5 per brick . This example clearly shows how versatile the STG Renko indicators are. Enjoy

Hello Hutch, Thanks for helping so much for us. I really appreciate your efforts. Can I ask some more? What brick size did you use for Dow ? When you trade the Daily time frame, do you also use Renko ? What brick size ? Thanks Sz

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I made a few DOW trades but I'm not an expert. FXSniper stated in post #66 that he uses 600 points ($6) brick size so with his wealth of experience it's best to follow his advice. By definition Renko has no timeframe only price action so like other day traders I use exclusively D1 charts. Of course you could use Renko to approximate the D1 timeframe candle but I have never seen anybody recommending that.

Using 10 pips Renko only news can really screw up a trade so best is not to enter into a trade before a major news. Normally the MACD will stay above/below zero as the case may be until there are 2 opposite candles as shown in the picture. The trendline indicates entry/exit. As with any system don't expect to win all trades

Nice trades on your four charts they really show the advantage of trading Renko Any MACD will do a good job with Renko; the bigger the EMAs the longer the trade can remain open. Using the half-trend to confirm entry is a good idea. You are very patient leaving a trade open for over 4 days and still going. We all wish all trades would go our way unfortunately this is not the case

Quite a nice strategy but too many days with only a few Renko bricks. On such a low ATR pair (USDCHF) low Renko brick sizes are best but a trader will not get many trades.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
If you use the STG Renko Chart and the STG Renko Chart remote indicators you will often notice that when you open your chart in the morning there seems to be too few Renko bricks. This is because the STG Renko Chart did not update the remote chart. Although the correct price is shown on the remote chart and will keep updating properly the chart is incomplete. To solve this problem all you have to do is to update the chart by changing the size of bricks on the remote chart then put it back to the original brick size. The first chart shows my GBPAUD chart when I first opened it. As you can see there were only 5 Renko bricks for today (2 long and 3 short). After changing the brick size on the STG Renko Chart remote indicator from 10 pips to 9 pips then putting it back to 10 pips the chart is now shown correctly. The first chart shows the chart when I opened it. The second chart shows the updated chart after I changed the brick size to 9 pips then put it back to 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
That is why I do not use STG for real trade. Another disadvantage is the STG will not show the amount of renko bricks you want on the chart. Ok this is not a big problem but there is a better solution. Congratulations, you are the only one who noticed this error.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
What I like the most about STG is that I can easily change the brick size without having to modify the Renko generator EA or indicator on the source M1 chart and open a new Renko chart. This features saves a lot of time when checking different Renko brick settings.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Strategies can be improved so I modified the strategy in post #40 as follows: 1. Changed the 2 MA crossover (4,3) with MA cross Alert (3,2). Although it doesn’t correspond with the FxBayMACD settings it provides an earlier alert. 2. Added a halftrend indicator that also gives an earlier alert. Please note that the FxBayMACD remains the best indicator for this strategy. In the chart below I will not initiate a buy until the halftrend indicator produces an arrow and/or the FxBay MACD histogram is above the zero line.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Here is the chart update. Writing the previous post I missed the entry

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello Hutch ! Thank you very much for your post. I really like the ideas that you share with us. The Fx bay system looks promising to me. I test it. HalfTrend TT [x5v4].ex4 indicator gives us an early signal, but it has no push notification. Do you know a version of it wich produces push notification ? I have a full time job and try to test the signals. Thanks Sz

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Maybe this one

--- 帖子 #134 ---
What are you using for stop loss? I read through the post but not sure I saw this anywhere. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
All halftrends normally work properly with my strategy as long as the factor/period is set to 2.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Me bad … I don't use a stop loss. There are two reasons why I don't use it. First if the trend changes the halftrend will give a signal at which time you must look at the FxBay MACD to see if the histogram changed direction (above or below the zero line). If it did close the trade and see if you should open a new trade. The other reason is that I never have many trades opened at the same time so I see what's happening. Normally the trade as represented by the FxBay MACD will not change direction when you have two consecutive opposite color bricks as you can see in the chart in post #131. If you want to use a stop loss I think it's best is to use the equivalent of three bricks.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Thanks for that. I'll do some testing. "Small bricks are only good with low ATR pairs since a trader would not get many good trades with bigger bricks. But then I only trade high ATR pairs" What do you consider high ATR - over 100, 120, etc.? Thanks in advance for answering my questions!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Let's give a chance. Hutch we will see. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Everybody has an opinion about what a high and a low ATR is. For me a high ATR is above 100. As you can see in my charts I use a 10-day ATR as shown in the Infoboard indicator. Of course you might wish to use another value but a two week average is good enough for me. Please note that ATR values change over time. Prior to the month of March EURUSD had a 10-day ATR below 60. In April-May the 10-day ATR went above 100 and at this moment it's 93 but since the ATR is 123 at this time tomorrow's EURUSD ATR will most likely be closer to 100. The best pairs to trade have a high ATR with a low spread. EURJPY normally has an ATR above 100 every day with a low spread so it's a good pair. In the chart below Friday's ATR was 80 but the ATRs for the other days were above 100.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
This is not repaint.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
This brings do much clarity to Renko trading. Thanks for sharing. I actually applied the template live today on EURUSD 2.5 bricks but found out that the half trend was horribly repainting. The remedy was simply to use the regular half trend indicator but reduced to 1 instead of 2. What I found was that everytime the MA 3 crosses 4, there's a close above or below the half trend sometimes the bars breach the half trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I had been working on the lower brick size approach before now so I applied a filter that I found so reliable, the OBO Trend bars and they smoothed out "fakeys" a bit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It's not entirely loss free but it's the ideal for small brick size, if your daily target is 10 pips you only need to capture 4 bricks net of commissions. My current template is more conservative ( filtering with default MACD settings) but not completely loss free. Losses should not exceed 7.5 pips that is 3 bricks which is a lot less than 30 if you trade with 10 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here's the template let me know what you think.

I woke up late missed the FO moves.

Power was just restored and thought to answer a PM here with a screenshot, and a buy signal came, I went in but delayed data feed, caught me in deficit from entry. I cut the trade the n -0.9 pips but it turned out the real position was -6.4 pips. Some things are out of my control like ISPs

--- 帖子 #150 ---
After all the sulking, I decided to at least get back what my ISP cost me. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I was a candle late but I held on beyond the Pivot line which was the nearest target. There's no doubt about it, there are more wins than losses my confidence is at an all time high.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
The pivot lines are great targets, though sometimes, the Market makers shift the goal post It's all in the rar file. Grab a few and wait for the next signal.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Very nice job Now you also know why I don't trade low ATR pairs since to be effective you also need low brick sizes. The biggest advantage of trading EURUSD is the low spread and, if you can make 10 pips trading that pair every day, you can make a very good living after a trader has steadily grown his account. I know someone that trades only EURUSD using 35 lots at a time. He makes more money every day than an average worker makes in a month.

I always wondered how much the market can take at anytime, does it mean that when my 0.01 lots are being filled, someone else's 70 lots too is being filled or at some times, certain volume of orders cannot be filled?

For me it is not working. How do you make the renko bars? At me the renko bars not formed.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
When you lost the BUY signal, why didn't you open Sall? Scare?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Actually the market is blind so I think that all orders will be filled at the prevailing price. On the other hand brokers are not. This is why they all impose a maximum number of lots that can be traded in one order as you can see below from my two brokers. Many traders don't realize that volume is meaningless when trading forex. Whether you trade 0.01 lot or 100,000 lots in one order the volume is 1.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I was too angry at myself, if I had taken only one lot on the buy, I'd have taken the sell when the buy went into deficit. It's a n emotional error, instead of multiple lots just increase the lot size and scale out of the trade in profit or exit once in loss.

Yes I still use STG Renko but don't forget to refresh the chart every time you open it as seen in post #127. For CFDs with very high ATR such as the DJ, SPY, DAX, etc. I use the attached EA because STG has problems dealing with Renko bricks that are over 100 points.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I used a parallel Renko builder with bricks of $ 5 and here is the result. The second chart is the same but with Renko shift 10%. As you can see the STG remote shows 50 points when in fact it’s 500. This is why I don’t use STG Renko for bricks higher than 100. Maybe I should trade the DJ instead of the FTSE

And I am yet to see the T3 in live action, so still hold on to the 20 Smoothed MA which is closer to it.

Someone might like to give it a go?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
One thing I must say about the T3 and low ADR pairs like EURUSD is that you need to use them on lower pips brick size, I'm guessing he's using 5pios or higher that is why the T3 seems so lagging.

Hi, as I'm new here in the forum as well as in Renko. Can you briefly provide information on how to trade your Renko system and attach all indicators and template of your Renko system. I would be very grateful . Best regards [COLOR=inherit !important] [/color] #s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini { display: none !important; }

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I think that the problem is either that you don't have enough M1 bars or something is wrong with how the broker MT4 platform interprets the data. Also, did you allow DLL on the common tab and put the right starting price? Here is a GBPUSD chart with the MTH indicator and the Renko M3 chart produced by that indicator.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Your solutions works well but you no longer have easy access to the indicators. What I do is to create an Unused folder within the Indicators folder as seen below. This way there is no need to delete or archive indicators and you have easy access to them when needed by moving them to the Indicators folder.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Please take a look at post #130 for the template and indicators and post #127 on how to "update" the STG Renko charts when you first open them every day. Please note that the key to this system is to follow the halftrend arrows and the FX BAY MACD. By adding the halftrend indicator the value of the MA crossover is less important than before I made this change.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hutch, thank you very much, I will see posts you mentioned and maybe I will start trading your Renko System, although it is a total novelty for me, but I have heard that Renko is one of the most profitable strategies

--- 帖子 #191 ---
And if you havent you must change from bars to candlesticks......I know some mt4`s doesnt show renkobricks if set to bars... PM:And really no use for any indicators other than the renkos itself other than the MACD and my favorite MACD Histogram divergence the MA crossover will be at the same brick at every turn so just enter on second ore third box with the overall trend and set the stop just under close against you so if you use 3 pips Bricks the stop will be 7 pips and 8 pips bricks 17 pips and so on and make sure there are atleast two legs with minimum 4 bricks before entering so there is some continuation in the moves so you dont get into choppy cause choppy conditions can drain your account with renkos....I may get out to soon on some trades but i set my TP at the first close against me ore i just scalp one ore two boxes if you look at left on any chart and you have 2 legs with 3-4 boxes before you enter on second box you will see that your winrate with one box scalp and one box stop will be very good...This is my two cents for renkos,but again i just cant be disiplined enough so i have moved over to other tings,but renkos can be very powerful if used systematic the right way..... PM again:lol: when dow first moves in strings from a hour after U.S open to U:S close you can catch a bounch of pips that will take out 8-10 losses using 600 points bricks and 1300 points stop......Often 100 pips ore more just jump in on second box when its two ore tre nice strings before entering and again with the overall trend of course....Often the trade is done in minutes DOW is real beast that is why need a pretty tight stop...... I may have mentioned all this in a earlier post,but i am geting old and senil so bear with me....hehe

Now I have seen the T3 in action, taken a few trades live and I must say it's truly non repainting. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I later tried to see how the Mathtrader7 Renko builder could improve the set-up but seems my system could not handle both the Ovo and Mttader EA as it caused my system to freeze so I had to exit my trade before TP.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I observed that most times when price changes direction and closes on the other side of the Half trend, it coincides with the MACD close above or below the zero line, and on turn coincides with the 3/4 MA cross. So I decided to remove the half trend and stick with it the MA cross. This seemed to have in hindsight avoided a loosing Half trend signal.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
In between power outages I was looking over how the indicators were performing andd taking notes. I found the 2 MA cross indicator repainted, heartbreaking it was for me I don't have the patience to work with repainting indicators as what you get in backtest or review is not what you get live. It seemed that I would have been triggered short by the 2 MA cross indicator where the loosing Half trend signal came, but it would have repainted after price changed it's mind because MACD crossed the middle line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There was a Bullish 2MA cross signal then a Bearish signal immediately after at the end of this screenshot. That Bullish signal conveniently disappeared later. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As a result, I'm trying out another MA Cross indicator to replace it.

I don't know about you but I prefer an early entry with the HalfTrend TT [x5v4] that repaints instead of the HalfTrendT6 that doesn't repaint but gives a signal sometimes when the trend has almost ended.

Here is another but I have not tested it...O.K at a quick glance it appears to be the same as the halftrend6 R

Hello Hutch, What am I doing wrong to not being able to get my blocks in 10 pips? I am new to the whole renko trading. Thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

STG Renko has 2 components. First the STG_RenkoChart that has to be put on the source chart that will be used to produce the Renko chart. The second is the STG_RenkoChart_Remote that can be put on the Renko chart that has been produced by the STG_RenkoChart. The chart that you are showing is a D1 source chart. To solve the proplem: 1. Please make sure that the STG_RenkoChart indicator shows 1 Day in the input tab (picture attached). 2. Please open the M69 offline chart GBPJPY brick size 10 pips as indicated on the STG_RenkoChart indicator. This way you can trade GBPJPY on your D1 chart and also trade GBPJPY on your M69 Renko 10 pips chart.

hi@Hutch !, i have newbie question to ask,is there a way to make the HalfTrend TT [x5v4] shows arrow when the brick is complete?.sorry for asking a noob question.im kinda new in this forex world.still learning and still need to learn a lot of thing.thanks man.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
All you have to do is to set the ShowArrows value to True in the input tab. Never be sorry to ask a question we are all in FF to help each others.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
thanks man.now i can see the arrow.really thanks.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
hi, Hutch. I can't found offline m67 chart. help me.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Youtube and google will have step by step instructions on how to set up renko charts.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
You need to open the offline chart using the MT4 "File" "Open Offline". Locate your M67 chart and click on it.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
You are right they are the same. Here are two charts with half trend TT amplitude 2 and yellow arrows. The first chart also has half trend nrp mladen amplitude 1 and the second chart with half trend nrp mladen amplitude 2. Half trend nrp mladen amplitude 1 gives too many signals. Half trend nrp mladen amplitude 2 gives good signals but 2 bricks after the half trend TT. Conclusion half trend TT amplitude 2 is better

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hey Hutch, I noticed you put up half trend compiled version i do have the source (attached) I'm sure there would be someone perhaps yourself, who would like push notifications and alert on bar close rather than when the renko candle is still forming, I'm no coder but its here for some one to add the code.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Sorry Lewis but I'm not a programmer either. In any case you have the choice to put the alert on current bar or not. If you want changes to the indicator please request it using this thread https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...?goto=lastpost

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hey no worries mate, thought i would put it up if no use to you bud someone will find use for it, i use half trend nrp mladen with renko as it had the push notification when im out and about. Good trading mate

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hey Hutch Thank you for your comparison! It looks like TT gives less noise and is more accurate, i will try it. How do you handle your Exit? Right now im trying to take x2 from my stopp to locate my Exit (temporary) and start trailing if Price moves in higher Trend direction.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I normally exit the trade when: 1. On the first opposite half trend arrow; 2. Wait until the Fx Bay MACD crosses the zero line; 3. After a number of Renko bricks (I normally use a Stop Loss of 3 bricks).

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thankyou! may ask you to show some trade in live position here ? it is beter if it was eurusd!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Sorry but I don't trade EURUSD because of the low ATR (less than 100) that requires low Renko bricks. I will try tomorrow

--- 帖子 #229 ---
EURUSD is crap but I made one trade buying on retracement (first chart) and closing after the first opposite half trend arrow (second chart) making a fantastic profit of $63

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Good result. I see you entered mid brick (4 pips size) based on the half trend arrow that are would have disappeared had the instrument gone South with you on a long position, what would you normally do in such situations?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
My biggest problem is that I'm not a EURUSD trader so I have little experience trading that pair. The only reason I initiated that trade was to answer arya.aryaee . With a small Renko brick size it's best to close the trade on the first opposite arrow. If the bricks had been 10 pips and I would already have made a substantial profit I would have left the trade run until I would have had 3 opposite side bricks (Trailing stop of 30 pips). Unfortunately this is totally impossible with trading EURUSD because of the very low ATR. This was my first EURUSD trade this year and probably the last

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi @Hutch, is there an alert for when a brick closes?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I don't have an indicator that provides an alert when a brick closes but you might want to try these

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Oooooh yes! this will do sir. Very much appreciated. Thanks a bunch

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi @Hutch, thank you for sharing knowledge. I tried your system but it was repainted so badly, could you give some advice how to handle the trade, especially when the arrow keep appear and disappear all the time. Looking forward to hear your advice. Many thanks. CB .

--- 帖子 #236 ---
The half trend TT does repaint but only on the current candle not after it has closed. Also I don't use the MA crossover. Unless you have a VPS it is best to refresh he Renko chart by changing the candle size then go back to the size you want to trade with. Here is the result for EURJPY.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Different Brokers feed can give different results but I guess every one knows this......There are many ways to Skin a Cat so I guess one must find what suits them best.....Congratulations to Hutch for taking the time to present and explain his Renko chart......I trade 4Hr and Renko and usually use a larger brick size...Just a personal preference. R

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Where are your wicks ?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I use a commercial Renko EA which does not have wicks....Just suits me fine....Again just my preference after 19 years using Renko....What works for one person may not work for another. R

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I know a few like you but I wonder what edge does it have over " wicked" renko, how do you know the high or low of each bars etc...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
O.K mate I looked at your history so you do it your way and I will do it my way.....The Target is to win and many people take different paths. Good Luck to you. R

--- 帖子 #242 ---
The question is legitimate though, what edge do wickless renko bars have over those with wicks ? Very simple question. Anyway, good luck to you too.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Wicks are not a Renko standard. This is why most commercial Renko generators don't use them. The advantage of not using wicks is that it makes charts cleaner. Some traders say that the advantage of using wicks is that you see the total price action before the Renko brick closes. For example a 10 pips Renko brick might have had 9 1/2 pips above and below the body of the brick before it closed (29 pips). Does it matter? For me it doesn't because I trade the 10 pips Renko brick not the 29 pips price action candle. Ced74 is right stating: "The Target is to win and many people take different path". It's a matter of choice

--- 帖子 #244 ---
For me it does matter, not everyone exit trades on reversals, some do exit way before and for this we need the wicks both for trading and for visual help. Except for looking clean and nice wickless candles just hide important information.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I agree with you that a wickless candle hides information that could be important but we all trade the body of the Renko brick not the wick

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Well everyone has their own way of trading. I've been using renko since before most people had even heard of them and I wouldn't use them without a wick.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Dear Mr @Hutch senpai &lt;3 Thank you for your replying, it's seem that different renko generator result in different charts ( or may be @Ced74 advice is right but i have not checked other brokers ^^ ), i am totally new but love to analyze renko chart. On the left is chart with STG renkochart and the right with renkolivechart 3.3x2.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello @hutch Just wondering how you use the MACD while trading this system and also at what point do you exit?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I know that different price feed should always produce a different chart but I cannot explain why different Renko chart generators used with the same broker would produce slightly different charts. Maybe other traders have an explanation.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
The key to this strategy is to follow the half trend arrows and check if the Fx Bay MACD line is above or below zero. You can go long when you get a half trend arrow and the Fx Bay MACD line is above zero. The opposite is true for short trades. Entering into a trade is very easy but getting out of it is not. You can get out of the trade: 1. On the first opposite half trend arrow. This is the most conservative option; 2. Wait until the Fx Bay MACD crosses the zero line; 3. After a number of Renko bricks (I normally use 3), or a little more if I’m making a good profit as seen in the charts Below. This is an aggressive option and it doesn't always work. As seen in the last chart. Chart 1 Initial trade take profit not taken on reverse arrow I was hoping for more pips. Chart 2 Stop loss almost hit. Chart 3 Stop loss hit for 37 pips profit. I would have made 13 more pips if I had exited on the reverse arrow. As you can see there are many options for closing trades.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Very well explained, i even see opportunities of re-entering with tight stoploss (10pips)once the halftrend colour is in line with MACD, Thank you very much sir for your kind assistance

Hi, this is a very simple and effective strategy. You observe the price behavior at important price levels. For me, it's 100, 50 and 25 These are the natural resistance support zones for the price. You make swing deals. Whether you catch a of 5, 50 or 100 pips depends only on the market. With Renko candles it is easy to enter into transactions and secure on BE.

Do you prefer some pairs or all pairs with ATR&gt;100?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Best is to trade WTI but I also like DJ30 and GBP pairs. Here is a chart of the WTI for the last 4 days. The Oanda spread is a low 3 cents and the ATR is always above 100. I also attached a chart of the highest ATR currency pairs for popular pairs. I trade while watching Netflix

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Of course there are also false signals. It's part of the business. If you have some experience, you can eliminate some of them.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
i like to use csdash with H4 signal. You have the calendar in a zip package. You can watch H4 and H1 if you want. At first, don't follow 28 pairs. The fewer pairs you observe, the faster you learn and the better your efficiency. P.S. The brick hand must be caught up with volatility. The larger the bricks you use, the better the signal quality.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks jarfx05 for your advice. Yes the calendar was there...my bad. I notice you use this pairs as following Attached Image do you load all this pair in one chart like this Attached Image (click to enlarge) and later you just push the bottom of the pair based on the alarm of Cdash? If yes can you tell me the brick number for every pair that you use? Thanks in advance

By the way trading exclusively WTI Renko 10 pips you have to work real hard to lose money I tried 5 pips Renko but it wasn't that good.

Hey jarfx05 Congratulations that you build up such a nice system i hope it plays out very well ! Do you use Range Bars ? @Hutch your right, 10 Pips are great for middle ATR pairs, i didnt observe WTI but on Gold i use a 5$- 10$ size and it work good for me right now... At the Moment i test some BTC brick size on Demo. My Renko System is at the Moment stable and i hole to get my next tp on the Account.

Dear @Hutch senpai, I only start learning FX for more than 2 months, but i spent a lot of time reading and testing things out, thanks @Hutch for always helping newbie, @Jarfx05 for mysterious knowledge, @Interpidpips for your passion, and @havo maybe you know he is famous for the love of renko, i don't know why he is not participate in this thread. I read previous posts from you @Hutch, and i know you don't like people who complaining about repaint indicator instead of trying to make them work for you. But out of other people, you always stick to your strategy and i like it that way i don't see much change from time to time, which means you have already master your strategy, may i ask what would you do in @since80808 situation?, cuz it happens to me all the time, when the new direction Half Trend TT appears ( candle already closed ), later it disappear and go on to the previous trend, i'm crewed lol. P/S: I manually tested your strategy with non repainted HT version, and the result is not so bad only if the we have a EA to place order after the arrow appear. On the left: risk/reward 1 brick for 1 brick, on the right risk/reward 1 brick for 2 , 10pipbox GBPUSD pair from 30-July to 12-August. 2nd is better, gain 6 brick for almost half month Looking forward to learn your solution, With respect. CB

--- 帖子 #301 ---
All Half Trend indicators give signals and they are never fake since they follow the logic of the Half Trend. The problem is that I haven't found a Half Trend better than the Half Trend TT even if it repaints. As you can see in the second picture posted above the Half Trend 2 normally gives a signal one pip after the Half Trend TT. This normally has no importance if you trade low value pairs such as EURUSD with $10 per pip ($50 for 5 pips Renko brick) but it really matters while trading the Dow Jones 30 since each pips is worth $100 and a Renko 5 pips brick is worth $500. The link below shows the same result with another Half Trend. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/post/13010678#post13010678

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I need the arrows to alert me because I often trade when I'm watching Netflix movies. You are right traders are responsible to make their own decisions but having an alert makes it easier to follow many charts at the same time. I think there is a small correlation between Gold and BTC but yesterday both went down when the USD went up so it looks like that there is a negative correlation for both with the USD.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
My answer is below your post since we posted at the same time I don't mind about traders complaining about repainting indicators since all posts add value even if they are negative. This is the reason why I don't have anyone on my ignore list. We must all respect other traders no matter what. Best is to know your indicators and adapt to repainting indicators. I must admit that when I started trading forex in 2005 I was as confused and lost as you are. Whether you win or lose a trade you are learning and gaining experience and this will make you a better trader. I don't like EAs so even if someone produce one for my system I would not use it. The reason I say this is that I don't trust EAs and sometime their logic are flawed. Mr. Tea in post #299 above is totally right stating that "keep the light on, at the End its your personal decision and not the arrow ones...".

If you are a specialist in 3 currency pairs, you will be a rich man. Watching many pairs only weighs down the mind. The 12 pip versus 3 pip chart are two different worlds. It's like M5 and H4.

These are my 3 Pairs and 1 on/off Pair most of the Time Gold or BTC. In combination with supply/demand zones, Price detection and Open/Close im fine with it. I dont know if i want to use indicators, i still struggle with it. I love to have a clean view on Price. RMI is nice to get some Momentum information or some EMA to ride along. I will test Donchian chanel on one pair, thx for advice. Exit/Greed Faktor is still something i need to handle with. (There are some things i need to adjust on my rules to build up a healthy wealth balance) There is still a lot of Homework to do, i get some Turtle Way books here and will take a closer look into them.

thank you for posting chart like this up. 1/ what is it you use in the lower window? 2/ In Renko you dont apply TL, and expect change in renko's trend when TL is broken? 3/ Could you apply rule like using DOW 3 point principle, similar the quest in determine trend: find Initial new structure INS then when price broken last swing high/low we have new structure high/low (NSH/NSL) and confirm price direction change 4/ could we apply rule of fibo retracement/extension on renko 5/ if fibo is applicable, pullback seems rarely follow rule (not going to the expect 38.2%, 50%, 70%) how do we explain? 6/ in your renko chart, do you always apply renko brick builder script on base chart M1, or you apply it also on base chart higher TF( and which high TF) 7/ if I use keltner channel together with renko and argue each time renko breaks out of channel line and channel direction changed, I expect renko chart will move to the opposite channel line. what your opinion on it... Nonsense and what argument? 8/ MA/EMA often used in normal chart as dynamic S and R zone, if use EMA50 with renko and follow rule like stay in the price until EMA broken again; trend is up/down if EMA12 cross up/down EMA36; or renko trend up/down if it is above/under EMA200 etc. would it be safe, or just coincident? 9/ if I draw up a rule: Use MA price band length 50 apply on close and on open on renko chart and setup rule, when cross up and STOCH heads to OB area, I buy and stay until broken; if renko cross down and STOCH points down to OS area until broken, SL is one brick.... would you say it is sane? or phantasie? 10/ what are you using to create your offline chart? I just found a bug in the commercial MeanRenkoBar.ex4 renko chart generator: Generated Brick size is double what you want in the setup!... Very shocking to the bone.

@Hutch Thank you for all your input, as well as all members here. I am an experienced price action trader but am new to renko and boy is it cool to me! I have a couple of questions for you particularly if you don't mind: 1. why is it important to have a m67 TF if renko doesn't take into account time at all? 2. to be more clear on your entry requirements, do you wait for all three to occur before you enter (arrow, half trend color change, and zero cross), or just one to? 3. I am having the same problem as a previous post with not enough bricks when the chart is initially set up (see below). Your solution mentioned clicking "home" but I'm not sure what you are referencing Thank you very much. Trying to trade as similarly as an experienced renko trader such as yourself for now until I get the hang of it

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hmm its hard for me to answer your questions because it looks like you dont have done enought research by your own... It looks like you are sitting on a table and want that i have to serve you dish by dish and you are only eating. There is no afford to read the hole thread or look for some other renko threads, otherwise you would know how to set up Renko. Im old and i teached a lot of people in other things but i was only teaching guys who wants to get knowledge. Im new to MT4,i spend one week to check how everything works and even how to creat Renko. So if you can play with a Smartphone i would mind you will get into MT4 too. Again this is maybe a bad Answer to all your questions but for me it feels like you dont have done your Homework and this is subjektiv. To your Questions 1: read the howl thread, i explained what it is. 2: i use TL for other reasons but i think it should work with it, need some test. 3: - 4+5: cant tell you im not using it. 6: read about Renko 7: i use most most of the time clean clean charts 8: i dont use ema cross, testing Something else 9: i dont use stoch 10: there are a few nice Renko offline builder in this Forum, Hutch give you a hint. Would be nice if you setup your MT4 and test your questions and give us some advice if it work or not that would be nice, keep it up! No, i dont publish my work. Do you follow a Strategy? Mr.T

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi NTK, I would echo some of Mr.Teas comments, I think with Renko you can keep it simple, just own a process that you are comfortable with and refine it until it is consistent. I you don't make it your own it will not work for you. I took 20 pips earlier this morning on the DAX, I'll probably take another 20 later. I use this Renko EA shown in the following chart, 10 pip bricks (20 pip reversal bricks), SL is the yellow dash, green line is the entry. I also use a 5 pip chart to examine the granularity of the potential trade before I commit to it. Cheers, dave

Tradingview has the Standard Renko chart, the only options to choose are ATR based or traditional to setup manuel brick size. So my view to MT4 Renko is that every coder has his own math for creating renko, could someone confirm it? N ext week i will try the trial from ovo to run some tests and compare to the common Renko from FF. ( Maybe i get it done this week). @David simple S/R Lines on your chart or Pivot Points ?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi Mr Tea, simple S/R lines, no pivots. I mark up the big numbers on the DAX because there can be a fair amount of choppy swings around these levels, but not always I just tend to avoid them. Other than that its simple S/R and occasional trend line. Cheers, Dave

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Round Numbers works pretty good! Yeah your right^^ do you switch from Renko to Candlestick or stay at one chart? Renko is fascinating, there is so much to test and learn to get a nice solid system.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi Mate, i can answer a couple of those questions for you, leave the trade entries questions for Hutch 1, As for the M67 it is essentially just a name for the template, so TF has nothing to do with it. 3, When you create a new chart to trade on make sure to download history for that asset before creating the Renko chart, this can be done by going to Tools - History, look for the asset you want to get history for and download it... or you can first open a standard M1 chart for that particular pair and scroll back manually with the arrow button on key board, takes a bit longer this way... maybe a minute for about a month worth of data, zoom in 100% on the chart before you scroll. I usually load about a month of M1 data for a Renko chart as it's usually enough for a full chart. the pic below is my Master Template for the Pairs I trade, make a Master and save it for easy loading each day etc. also shown is the STG RenkoChart indi settings for EURUSD, on the 3rd line is 'Offline Timeframe start' (in other words Name for the chart). 66 is the starting number, each subsequent indi loaded will make a new chart with the next number in the sequence M67, M68 etc. you can change the starting number if you want something different. the EURUSD chart was the first one made, for any following copies of STG RenkoChart indi loaded make sure to insert Symbol Name in the 'Use other price feed symbol' line so that a new 'M' chart will be made for that symbol. make sure to put a Template name in the indi settings for the Renko chart that you want to trade on to open when the 'M' button is clicked on the Master chart. Mine is 'Renko Trade' saved as a template i have 4 loaded as you can see, M67 - M70 After opening the Renko Trade chart for EURUSD by clicking on the M67 button at bottom right of screen is to increase the brick size on the Renko Trade chart using the Up/Down buttons, then put it back to the setting i want, ex: 10 pips up to 11 pips then back to 10 pips, this insures correct bricks and price displayed. You need to have the STG Remote indi on the trading chart for this. hope you don't mind me jumping in to explain this cheers Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi MrTea, I just work from the Renko charts, no candles other than the M1 chart to generate the offline Renko chart, but I don't use the M1 chart for trading. I also find Renko fascinating, it has taken me a while to really understand how to use it - a lot of mistakes! Now I don't use anything else, and I only trade on the DAX because I can get something out of it most days using the 5 pip and 10 pip charts. I also think you have to be very comfortable with the "flavour" of Renko that you use, personally I have got used to this style of non gap Renko which is MathTrader7's EA. Cheers, Dave

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Oh yes after a few years of education/ practicing in normal TA charting i was quiet happy to see something different! Without mistakes we have no improvement, so its quiet necessary to burn Fingers, to get better and better. I get burned too xD Cool, nice to hear. At the beginning i observed both renko and candles, to get a better understanding. After this process i start to watch Renko only and add some S/R, Zones etc. I tried Math Renko for two weeks but personal i dont like it...

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi, I too am new to Renko and am trialing some ideas alongside my normal trading. below is my chart set up with Hutch's settings and some of jarfx05's ideas. it's a work in progress, definitely not an expert Renko trader Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I agree the flavour of Renko you adopt is very personal. I think I have tried a variety of FF freebies and commercial offerings before I finally settled on this EA. I also started with both candles and Renko, but I got confused so stuck to the Renko only! I like things simple, less is more.. Just taken +12 on the DAX, again green line is entry, yellow dash SL. I guess I should have let it run but I would be breaking my own rules!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Everyone draw his own picture that we see, so a bit personal is allowed at the end i think we talk about the same system with diffrent rules. Some trader need a christmas tree on chart others love it clean, it doesnt matter. You enter a trade after 10 pips and close on hitting S/R or on brick change ? Do you only trade Dax ? What if you hit a good trend?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I struggle with Christmas tree charts Once I've opened a trade at the reverse brick I close it at the completion of the first 10 pip brick, I'll do this two or three times, then maybe let the next run a bit more, so I end up with at least 30 pips per day which is generally possible most days on the DAX (yes I only trade the DAX now) although I only managed +10 yesterday because I don't like Monday mornings, and the afternoon was rubbish for my rules! The first trade today for +20 wasn't really intended; the market jumped +25 in a few seconds, the target was +10 so I was happy to take the +20 from it

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks so much helped a lot. For the template name I am using Hutchs system so I just apply it after the chart is created. Thanks for the help

--- 帖子 #332 ---
big round number (BRN) quarter (25,50,75) and psycho level, limit levels (daily/weekly/monthly) work very well in Renko, and also time based chart. Levels are levels

--- 帖子 #333 ---
thank you for your great effort to answer. Your reply helps me a lot. Shame, you dont publish your trading chart or analyse chart, I would be a big follower.fan of your library of knowledge Before using trading view subscription to use Renko lower then daily, worth to study review of many trader about tradingview's renko design. I would recommend all renko users to check the brick size and quality quantity of bricks in your offline chart, dont assume Renko flatten out isse of time based chart. In Renko or time based chart the accuracy, your aim is important, like you remote control a great dart arrow, but if you say one renko gives you two, and you hit target, it is just more luck then ability. and the recommendation is for Meanrenkobasechart Doublemeanrenkobasechart STG_renko Tipu_Renko RenkoLifechart i test V600 upwards RenkoChartSuite i test V.3.3 renkolivecharts_pimped_v4_13 Renko_mod RenkoFXbuilder

--- 帖子 #334 ---
thank you for your help. "I also use a 5 pip chart to examine the granularity of the potential trade before I commit to it." thank for the idea. For my part, I am not experienced in using Renko, so when it looks good on Renko, for trading I still go back to time based chart checking down 3 time frames to confirm my decision to wait or to trade ... mistrust of new technology and old habit never died ... a sign of pld age ... I guess.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi ntk, The brick sizes I use on the DAX in general work OK because there is usually quite a lot of movement on an average day, these sizes may not be so useful on other instruments. On some currency pairs you might be waiting all day for a 20 pip reversal brick (if you are using this non gap Renko EA) to complete! Ok that's a bit of an exageration but I think you have to experiment to find the best brick size - one size definitely does not fit all. Cheers, Dave

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Very useful advise davidh061. I just subscribe. to check quickly Renko_brick_size I would recommend from FXGenial. What I found also helpful is use a renko with ATR for it to calculate the optimal brick size a few times, then I use that average down, to get close but not too granulate chart (what we dont want) .... again very subjective I need to ask you all experienced Renko users a question Reko , but in relation to time based chart, back there on TF chart to determine there is a continuation/BO, you can use EMA12, EMA24 so see a proper consolidation area before the decisive move; here in Renko if you can not use EMA nor trend line what behaviour would tell you in front of you is continuation or a BO, or a fake breakout to be expected? PS: One more question david, when ppl trading DAX DOW where is it? On ICM I see De30 is it DAX!? I see also US30, US100, US500 what is what ? where is DOW?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Please note that all brokers don't use the same name for the assets they offer for trading. For your information De30 is the DAX 30, US30 is the DOW 30, US100 is the NASDAQ 100 and US500 is the S&amp;P 500.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Choosing the right brick size for currency trading is quite easy but it's not exactly the same for CFDs. Here are examples for the DOW30. First chart Renko $5 bricks, second chart Renko $10 bricks and the last chart Renko $20 bricks. It's only a matter of choice and risk factors

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I went through all your posts with and without attachment. before I asked. I saw you developed from using time based chart to renko now, but you have not mentioned the indicator you use in the low window of that post. it functions like STOCH, but not. Looks like a combined shaff ind. or a cycle indi , but not ... Apropos thank you to you all, loads of very invaluable insights and advises here to learn in one day, I am sure other traders after me will valuable your support and advise very much.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Looks interesting on DOW. I have implemented your system successfully and will begin some testing soon. Starting with 4 GBP pairs with ATR over 100, $10 bricks. Going to stay true to entry and exit rules. I am usually asleep during London session but don't necessarily want to use an EA at first so the GBP pairs may not be best for me, might try DOW for NY session as I am in the States. I may look at creating a dashboard however. Thanks for the loads of info, seems like a really interesting way of trading and I'm excited!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Could you show me, pls.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I have done the ATR valuation and the optimal it get is 556 for DAX @ 12863.4 when you say your first chart for 5$, second for 10$ and third for 20$ depend on appetise of risk, how can I convert the $ it back to pips/point for the renko setting? If it is possible could you please use the renko_brick_size on those chart to show the brick size so that I got a feel how far I possibly went wrong on my setting

--- 帖子 #343 ---
in the Renko Remote window it says what size brick is being used on the far right, you can change it to whatever you want

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Sorry, i tought i posted it, nevermind: RMI

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Thank you to clear it out of the way. I use different method, but interesting to know RMI can be used this way. I only know RMI from time based chart and from this thread "Giving Back! My Best Expert Advisor EA Free for Everyone"

--- 帖子 #346 ---
What kind of method do you use?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
You are entirely correct for currency trading but not for CFD trading. For example the source file for the DOW 30 $20 per Renko brick needs to be set to 200 to cater to the number after the period as seen in the picture. Changing the brick size on the remote indicator will not produce the desired result only changing the brick size on the source file will work as intended.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
So using STG_Renko_remot 5pips setting is for 5$, 10 pips for 10$ for DAX renko, is the same rule for DOW, S%P500 why is this coincidence?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I use levels similar to half trend, but from FX_eagle ad nanotradersignal (possibly renamed and sold system from other author, but could not see orginal author) For cycle I use MACD divergence, 88 indicator to show increasing buyers present (can not post it is partly decomopiled), renkoMaker_confirm (I guess decompiled and renamed too) PS sorry spelling mistake, the 88 indictor is decomp and re-coded from Mr.X

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I used your indicator and it shows brick size of 20. That 20 brick size is the same as 20 ticks/pips or $20 per brick. In any case it shows a price move of the DOW 30 by $20. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
The STG Remote indicator shows the number of pips but not the currency so 10 pips for the DOW and S&amp;P 500 means $10 per brick but not for the DAX since the DAX is priced in EUR so 10 pips for the DAX is 10 EUR.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
hey Hutch, just curious but I know you said you like to trade on D1 so why do you trade GBP with 10 renko charts? seems pretty involving since renko needs to be monitored. cheers

--- 帖子 #353 ---
@Hutch, I am finalizing my trading strategy with your system using hard rules so I can learn and test it more effectively. This is what I have so far. - Only looking at a few GBP pairs over 100 ATR for now with $10 bricks, will probably change in the future. Entry: Only enter when all 3 are shown simultaneously - arrow signal upon closure of a brick - FXBay MACD crosses zero - half trend indicator is appropriate color/changed Exit: - once an opposite arrow has been formed on the closure of a brick (for more conservative and consistent results) - only thing I am still deciding on are the rules for the SL For example, below I attached a screenshot that shows all entry requirements being fulfilled and am about to enter. My only concern with this is how it will fair with consolidation. Any tips on how to fine tune the above rules to sit out on potential losses due to consolidation? Also, is it wise to turn around and re-enter on every opposite arrow that you exited on? ... since its a new signal Thanks again, anyone else feel free to add input and ideas, great things going on here.

Hi ntk, thank you for subscribing, although my posting is a bit erratic, I haven't posted this much for a while! On my broker the DAX index is listed as GER30, can't comment on the DOW. Cheers, Dave

--- 帖子 #356 ---
This is definitely an issue if you want to enter with confidence. I thought the arrows would not be removed if the brick they were indicating closed? Bottom is before

--- 帖子 #357 ---
There is nothing more boring than trading on D1 charts because even if you trade 20 currency pairs all you need is to spend 15 minutes a day to open a new trade, close a trade, see that a stop loss was hit or adjust the trailing stop. So when I'm not busy I trade with Renko during the day. I was busy yesterday morning here is the proof

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Hutch! As you saw on my screenshots I love your renko style and almost copy it May I ask your strategy on D1? Maybe you already wrote about it somewhere on FF? Thank you anyway

--- 帖子 #359 ---
It repaints after candle close, repainting indicators are worthless. Now you got to wonder why would a pro trader since 2005 advise people to use one and pretends that he has never seen it repaint after close ? See post 289. I have my own answer.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Im a trusting guy so I assume Hutch has a way around it, or maybe his setting are different. Not sure. Would be great to figure this out, its the only problem with this system and preventing it from being a very powerful tool that could also make for an excellent EA. It might be worth just using renko with fxbay Macd and trading with daily trend only. seems to produce good results

--- 帖子 #361 ---
My D1 strategy is a simple EMA crossover 10/21. Please note that both SS2009 repaint. It's a good strategy but like all strategies it sometime fails as seen on the AUDNZD chart. You can use the FX Bay MACD to indicate the crossover 10/21 but it's not necessary. You can use a MA crossover alert instead of the FPM entry arrow.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hutch could you please look over my strategy and also address how to deal with repainting halftrend and arrow during trading throughout the day? thank you

--- 帖子 #363 ---
You are using the strategy correctly but don't forget that the HalfTrend TT repaints. I normally use a 3 bricks SL but sometime if I have a good trade I'm more aggressive. Consolidation periods are lousy for any strategy. Here is an example. Since I don't leave trades opened overnight it was lousy.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
thanks for the reply. Any tips on getting around the repainting though? for example, would it be best to wait to enter a few bricks after the arrow, because I dont think it repaints if a few bricks have past. Or why not just enter when macd crosses after a confirmation brick and trade with the daily trend? just throwing ideas out. That repainting would seem to mess with my hard set rules ya know

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I now believe that the HalfTrend TT repaints but I'm not lying when I stated that I haven't seen it repaint on me after the close of a candle. In any case I prefer the HalfTrend TT indicator because it gives signals one or two candles earlier than HalfTrend indicators that don't repaint so repainting is a small price to pay to get better trades. Metta87, in my opinion you are entirely wrong stating that repainting indicators are worthless. I think you say that because you don't know how to handle repainting indicators and there are hundreds of them that traders use successfully every day. Since there are many non repainting HalfTrend indicators that have been posted in this thread please feel free to use the one that you feel is best. An alternative is to use the original strategy at post #40 that did not have the HalfTrend TT but you gain one brick by using the HalfTrend TT. Here is the chart at post #40.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
looks good. Just curious but why do you prefer an early entry indi that repaints over a sound one that may get you in slightly later? it seems like the repainting indi would get you in unnecessary losses from time to time.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
First of all, thank you! You wrote earlier, you spend 15 min a day to set trades and move SLs. Can you share your ideas? + How do you use repainting oscilators? Just look for the signals that 15 mins\day?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Repainting indicators look good only in hindsight, all the bad signals are erased and only the good ones are kept. So which early signals are you talking about, when you have multiple late ones that just disappear and make the indi look more sexy than it really is ? It took me less than 20 minutes to see it repaints yet you pretend you never saw it do so, so how long have you been using it then? If you suggest a repainting indi, especially to new traders, just mention that it redraws and dont make it look like what it is not. That's not the 1st time you're at it.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Have you looked at the old strategy that does not repaint? I backtersted it with a few pairs and the results were still extraordinary. Sure there are some losses during consolidation but they are vastly offset with the huge wins. I just hope these arrows dont actually repaint but I will monitor, if they dont then this is a winner

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Get rid of the repainting and you ll see that this it is just ordinary, test it for yourself and you'll see.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I did. Assuming the old arrows dont in fact repaint as stated earlier, which i dont think they do. I backtested two GBP pairs over 1 weeks time with $10 bricks and they netted 800 pips in that one week collectively

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hutch, if you have the time please explain how to set up the renko charts like yours from MT4 time based charts. Do you have a step-by step? I have never used renko charts and they look interesting.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I feel sure that Hutch has already explained this, either in here or other renko threads, but if you use google or youtube you will surely find step by step instructions of how to set up the charts.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
download his renko chart indicator, open a chart you want to turn into renko, go to the m1 timeframe, scroll back a couple weeks to load the history, insert the renko chart indicator, pick the pip amount per brick (usually 10) and remove wicks if you want, I also have to check box allow dll inputs, click ok, small window should appear on m1 chart, click the small box next to the pips per brick number (m67,68,etc), new renko chart will form, apply hutch’s template, keep original m1 chart running. You can add the renko remote indicator on the renko chart so you can change pip per brick on the fly

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Please take a look at post #206 Half Trend TT vs Half Trend 6 and post #297 Half Trend TT vs Half Trend 2. These two Half Trends don't repaint but sometimes gives signals when the trend has almost ended. Post #207 shows Half Trend NRP Mladen you might want to test it and show us the results. If Half Trend TT always repainted I would not use it since it probably would not produce substantial profits.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
He is more backward than the bollinger bands 10 with deviation 1.0, sometimes, does not give false signals because it is delayed, but BB I think they give more visual assistance. I prefer BB.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Been messing around with some renko strategies and decided to keep it really simple. I went with 10 pip bricks and works best on higher ATR pairs. Super simple, basically just a 10 EMA with a 20 SMMA, sell when EMA crosses the 20 and buy when opposite. There are arrows to show and alert this cross as well. Exit strategy was annoying me so I decided to go with profit based exits. Noticed its rare for the chart to not go at least another brick after an alert, so decided a low RR could still work. - SL is 30 pips but remove half position when 15 pip drawdown - take 80% profit after 10 pip brick and SL at BE - after 20 total pips use a trailing stop to capture bigger moves I like to get in with a big lot and get out so this works for me. Please anyone let me know any input or if there are better settings, I don't have much experience with renko strategies. My main concern is having a bad RR meaning one loss would hurt, but it seems like a very high win rate especially when I'm risk free after just 10 pips, and over 10 or more pairs, this could turn out to be profitable. Thanks

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Your money management is quite conservative so it is very sound. Trading 10 pairs at the same time is quite difficult so you need to be careful when you have something like half a dozen opened.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
thanks and thanks for the advice. I thought that initially but noticed that there are really only 1 or 2 crosses per pair per day, and London open for me is 3am lol. Do you mean to be careful because it’s a lot to track that many crosses, or be careful to have potentially 10 trades open at one time. Also do you see that RR becoming a problem long term?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Unless you trade on a daily chart monitoring 10 charts can be difficult and lack of attention can kill your account. Here is the kind of cross that I like. Only one EMA cross that occurred on May 5

--- 帖子 #381 ---
That seems like a great system to have in the background as a secondary system but thats a little too boring for me I wouldn't mind pulling up a chart every time I get a MA cross alert but you do bring up a good point about how missing opportunities could kill an account, if you only happen to catch the bad ones and miss out on the good ones. Maybe thats why I would want to monitor many pairs during my hours to get more opportunity, then only trade during my hours, not sure ps: Are you still in that trade? crazy patience for that. I know you've listed your exit strategy for that daily system but where did you exit that trade if you did?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
As I said before there is nothing more boring than trading D1 chart. I closed the initial trade on June 19th when the price closed below the 21 EMA. I re-entered the trade on July 1st when the two SS indicators gave a signal being the same color. That trade is now up 570 pips but as you can see with the arrows I almost closed the trade last Friday and maybe I will have to close it tonight but I hope not. I never trade low ATR pairs using Renko but they are great on D1 charts because there is very rarely a gap and as you know gaps can kill a trade.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Yesterday I was thinking that my EURUSD trade was over with the price closing below the 21 EMA but instead it went up 80 pips. Looks like that the bull is still hungry for the USD.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Very nice trade Hutch, milking it! With this D1 trading, I would assume you monitor many pairs right? I would also assume it doesn't result an many substantial losses since the confirmation is strong.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I closed that EURUSD trade yesterday because the pair was too strong and I'm sure that it will retrace Monday. Best is to monitor the 28 major pairs that's the mix of AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, NZD and USD.

The latest version of the STG_RenkoChart indicator is from 2017. Unfortunately Lawrence stopped providing new updates to his indicators for free. I'm curious to know what made you change your mind. He seemed so excited to contribute. Even the youtube videos he deleted. The Telegram channel has also been abandoned.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I sent him a pm a while ago and he replied that he would look into providing an update when he's not busy but in any case his Renko chart indicator works fine except that it needs refreshing while trading stocks and CFDs because it was made to trade currency pairs and not these somewhat exotic investment instruments. We all need to respect his decision and thank him for his great work that benefits us all.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yes. Lawrence's indicator seems to work well today. Does this site belong to Lawrence? https://ovo.cz/products/offline-char...t4/renko-bars/ The indicator that is sold on this site is very similar to that of Lawrence.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Sorry but I don't know.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
No, it doesn't. As you've written, OVO's is paid, Lawrence's is free but it needs refreshing - it's not so big deal, I live with that already from the beginning of STG.

New Version of RENKO charts uploaded.. enjoy.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
For those who are not familiar with STG Renko here is the link. The STG indicators have been renamed STS Renko. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...erator-for-mt4 ?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thanks very kindly. I like the renko charts. But my problem is being available when my entry is about to trigger. It can take a lot of time, sitting, watching and waiting for the box to close can be intimidating. Wish u can build alarm to box close, it could help. And i wish to ask if could make a range bar chart just like renko chart too .. Range bars looks more like candle stick timeframe but are range bound.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Thanks Lawrence for your work and the time you have devoted to helping. Perfect tool. It made my life easier, because it allowed me first, to get close and then to use the Renko charts on the MT4, with a certainty of the displayed result. I can say it, after having dedicated a few hundred hours to the study of Renko charts and tests on all indicators and EAs available on the Internet, for its creation. Your tool was and remains - currently - the most reliable. Ps: I would have preferred to write on the wire https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...erator-for-mt4 where it was more logical to leave this review, but I don't have permission to do so. Thanks anyway.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Thanks for your contribution of this new version of renko, there are many new features that have added to this new version I've downloaded and tried, things work very well with the Standard RENKO chart, but then switching to the option of Mean RENKO, I see the late updated problem (whenever it has finished a new brick) and it seems like the prediction for mean RENKO candles is not in the right price. And could it be faster to execute the STS renko indicator when drop it on the chart! (It takes me a while to really open it) Wish for your success and hopefully the next version could be more and more enjoyable ^^ Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good evening friend, I think that you have many many bars loaded... very slow indeed. What broker are you using. I am using GoMarkets and it seems fast enough. Will post a short video Inserted Video Good luck

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thank you for replying to me. For a while of testing, it shows that the STANDARD RENKO is perfect, the price movement in both Online and Offline Chart is the same, very nice to use. I have used the MEAN Renko but it seems like whenever the current bar is finished, it causes some delay to create the Next ones while the price keeps moving away. I've screenshotted that moment of lagging on the MEAN RENKO chart, it has the current bar finished, and the price keeps moving down in the Online chart, but the Mean Renko chart seems slow to create a new bar I tested in both type of chart, the Standard Renko work perfect but Mean Renko is as I demonstrated above, a little bit slow in loading the new bar ah, I'm using ICmarket broker https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...3&amp;d=1603870553

Now I understand... must say that I have never used mean renko. Therefore it is more likely to contain fundamental errors. Sorry. Will check it out sometime in the future. Otherwise use the OVO product. Very good and stable. ps: no, I am not OVO.

So this is a reversal trade... even so I hate them. Indicators HMA 81 ,HMA 9, Envelop bands, OsMA, TDI Why reversal - Strong uptrend during the day, touch the 50 line, 9 HMA entering back into the 81, end of London coming up, risking 60 USD and could make 190 USD Attached Image (click to enlarge) And on the 1 MIN it is not moving.... bastard Attached Image (click to enlarge) And the result was a loss......

No problem. Renko maker tested and used (in the past) also on de30 - us500 - us2000 - hk50 - jp225. Also great on XAUUSD (not an index, I know ). I don't know specifically, but I believe @hutch mostly uses this. After all, it is truly the most reliable

Actually STS works in points not pips. Please take a look at the source chart and the Renko chart. 100 points = 10 pips.

VALUE OF THE PIP IN XAUUSD. This post is very long, but I ask everyone to read it and (above all) to reread it well, so that it is correctly understood. Please, do not extrapolate a word or phrase from the total context as usual. Try to have an open mind. I have around 950 hours of trading done exclusively with XAUUSD, in manual mode ... with my eyes constantly on the chart. I believe I can speak with some certainty on this issue. So, I have been trying to NOT address this topic for years. Now I think I can have my say. I know ... it's a losing battle. Another of the many. It is difficult for a person who has a conviction to admit that he is wrong, and here I speak in general without referring to anyone in particular. There is always a lot of confusion about the spread size, daily range and pip value in XAUUSD. Confusion mainly caused by an unregulated market and some brokers who: - or they don't know the difference (I've seen this too) - or provide incorrect information for their own benefit. In many cases, the gold (xauusd) is (wrongly) associated with Forex. This happens - often - when the Broker offers the classic 28 currency pairs + XAUUSD . In order not to scare and distract traders from this 29th asset, they prefer to say for example "xausd has a spread of 2 pips", instead of 20 as it actually is. On the other hand, to think that an instrument like XAUUSD - which is HIGHLY VOLATILE, more than any other pair - has a 10 day ADR of 364 pips, with a value of over $ 1872, is absurd and not comparable (GBPJPY, a of the most volatile Forex pairs, has a 10 day ADR of 119 and a value of 137 ). XAUUSD has ONLY 2 decimal places and must be calculated differently from Forex. There are no fractions of pips. It's like in Futures. As a result of this general confusion, pip calculators are also set up differently. Attached two in my favor. Of course there are others against me, but so much is. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This - as I said - is an endless discussion. Also because there is no official source that defines the standard. But that the Broker has 4 or 5 decimal digits ..... that has fixed or variable spreads .... that it is MM or ECN etc. etc. etc. -for me- does not change the substance. The last decimal place (in a two-decimal instrument) is not the fraction of a pip . It is the pip . Currently - Asian Market open for an hour and a half - I have a 10 day ADR of 3643 pips ..... a current daily range of 563 pips and a spread of 18 pips (latest data post attached image). I conclude with this note: you, whoever you are, who ask yourself or have asked yourself this info in the past, you have only two possibilities. And now you know them both. Whatever your idea/decision is, I respect it. You respect mine. And let's not stray this thread too far from the main theme Ps: @hutch, I'm serious. You are one of my teachers. I think I have read all your FF posts on trading with the Renko. Thanks for your past and future interventions. Pss: in the image there are all the data you need ... and even more.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I specify further: for example, a move from 1870 to 1871.25 (125 whatever you call them ), they are worth $125 minus commission (if any ) and spread . On the other hand in case of a move of 100 ( whatever you define them ) they will be $100 minus commission (if any ) and that's it .

--- 帖子 #355 ---
You are 100% correct the value of a XAUUSD pip is $1 but some forex dealers use 3 digits instead of 2. For me the third digit is useless.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Thanks for the information. When I started in Forex (2012) after a period on equities (2003) I had been looking for a (reliable) Broker with 3 decimal places on XAUUSD, but I had not found it. At that time I was younger and an "extreme" scalper. For me, the more decimal places there are, the more detailed and accurate I find the chart. However, I understand that for a non-scalper trader, this can only mean more "noise" and can be annoying. Over the years (and with the search for less stress) I have progressively switched to looking for trades with more pips. The road is still long, but being able to work with the Renko helped me for sure . I wish you a good job.

The second tool, I think is for sure an old acquaintance for some. Used mainly for the 00 level strategy, it is also excellent for Renko and has several possible uses. - to view the exact level of each past and future candle and - as in this case for the XAUUSD, for the subdivision into eighths of the full price Attached Image (click to enlarge) - for the subdivision into quarters and - identification/response at the main levels Attached Image (click to enlarge) - decimal subdivision (greater precision and level control around the full price .90 and .10) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Play with colors (more visible - less visible) and division%. Adapt everything to the instrument you want to work on. At least 5 possible uses for the "price" of 1. Maybe you can find others.

Im interested, is this inspired by the "heiken ashi" guy with the renko/macd combo for entry exits?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Not really a big fan of Heiken Ashi, however, I'm a huge fan of combining Mean Renko bars and a Super Guppy setup. For me, the trade entries and exits are loud and clear. BTW. Love all the information being provided here... thanks, everyone.

No probs For the EU pairs, I use a 20 brick size Mean Renko, then overlay with the Guppy GMMA indicator. In my case, I have complied a Super Guppy setup.

Sorry, Trader-IT my mistake. Another strategy I really like to share with you guys which I use with the Mean Renkos is with two 5 period MA's channel. One 1st applied to High and the 2nd applied to low. I also like a 5,3,3, Stochastic as seen in the screenshot Trade entries, as shown with blue vertical line. Hopefully, the rest will be self-explanatory

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Billy. Yes it qualifies as interesting As you can see the two SS2009 indicators give earlier signals than the EMA crossover 10/21. The reason I posted this strategy is that someone asked me to. I just posted a EURUSD D1 chart at post #121,431 in EURUSD Only | Page 3036 | Forex Factory

Mr Hutch, Would you mind sharing the the MLQ version of this indicator with yellow arrows that gives early signal. or may be point me to the site where i can get this (HalfTrend TT [x5v4] ). Would be grateful for response. Thank you

Here it is along with the indicator it was based on. Since it was originally in the Russian language comments are now in gibberish

--- 帖子 #446 ---
You will find that many indicators with the same name don't perform the same way. I tried the Russian one I provided you since I have the source file but, unfortunately, it works more like the HalfTrend 2. HalfTrend 2 always gives signals 1 or 2 bricks after the HalfTrend TT does as seen in your picture. Sorry but I don't have other HalfTrend source files. Best is to get a programmer to look at the .mq4 file to see how exactly it works.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
We are all trading with a broker and we are part of that brokers batch of traders. If we were in one big batch all together, we would all have the same data, but we don't. That is one reason why an indicator acts a little different between traders. I will not exclude other good reasons - just my humble thought.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Mr Hutch, You are so kind and truthful that you replied to my request. Its a good trait to have, humble in your Quote and very honest to say how you see it. I will try to search more on this indicator and hope to find my solution. Many Thanks to you friend.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I trade renkos and theese two divergence indis are nonrepaint and gives a lot of good signals do not take the all,but with pressure/trend and if you get arrow on both you have a even stronger signal....It helps me filtering out a lot of bad signals the arrows apear at open of second box and enter at once....But for renkos only i use 3 pips box...

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi Hutch, Thanks so much for sharing your ideas. It is always very helpful. Hope you are doing well and wishing you all the best for the new year. Can you tell me if there is a need for refresh on stocks and indices with the latest update of sts renko from November 2020? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I still refresh my charts upon opening each day because its an habit but also because the Renko charts are in points not pips so to get a 10 pips Renko chart you need to input 100 points even for currency pairs.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
sibianaga: the .mq4 file is correct but some of the settings are different than in the .ex4 file you mentioned. Specifically, other than colours and sizes, the MA_shift should be -2, the MA_period should be 1, the Factor should be 1 and the ATRdelta should be 0.57. I'll attach another copy of the .mq4 file here, with these changes made, so the .ex4 file, when compiled, will be identical to the previously posted .ex4 file. In addition, try using Mean Renko bricks. I think you'll find they allow for earlier entries and exits.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hay Buddy, Very much appreciated for enormous efforts and help. Will check out the revised file and press on with my project. I use OVO package for Renko Flex and set all my charts to 11.60 pips/Brick with no mean reversion 1:1 chart I also use RSI/13 for entries that match 30/70 scale for OS/OB levels When both match it gives 99% confirmed signal for entry. I am working on regentrating the Half trend to current MT4 build to include On calculate and inits. Thank you so much for your great work.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
thank you Do you use the standard or mean Renko? And which bricksize do you recommend for Forex - DAX &amp; Dow - WTI and XAUUSD?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi,sibianaga.i'm interested in your method.please tell me detail. share chart screenshot bestregards.thanks.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I use standard Renko but mean is also quite popular. For Forex if the ATR is below 100 it's best to trade with brick size 5 or even less and brick size 10 if above 100. These are mostly GBP pairs. WTI is best with 10 but you get more trades with 5. Dow is best with brick size 20 but you need a an account that has a good leverage. I tried the DAX with brick size 20 but 10 is better. The first chart is for trading DOW with its full value while the second chart is for e-mini. There are big differences in leverage and the tick value. Both charts use Renko brick size 20.

Yes it repaints also with Ma at 1 and shift at -2 the signal will appear after 2 forward bars are formed. The turn should be treated as Early indication that price has stabled and reversal is possible. Most if not all Half trend indicators are done to show fake revesals on past formations.

Hi,Pantera1. The halftrend indicator can't appear popup massage of buy alert. please check mq file.and please share. bestregards. thanks.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
You're right cycle indicators do repaint that being said they should. A cycle indicator uses goertzel alego that identifies previous peaks (phase shifts) and based on the intensity it predicts whether the current peak is a phase shift or not with some level of accuracy. To backrest a repainting cycle indicator you need to set a setting which bar to count from which is time consuming.

Here you go!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
In a range market the Renko bricks do not move much so you could think that you cannot lose but this is false since sometimes the Half Trend TT will give you a bad signal. Bad signals can easily be identified because they usually don't correlate with the direction of the FxBay MACD. GBPUSD is often in a range as you can see in the chart covering the last 2 days below but there were no bad signals. If Renko bricks change direction after 3 bricks you break even or lose a little depending on how fast you entered and closed the trade. With 2 bricks there is a chance to lose a trade because the Half Trend TT sometimes oscillate between giving an arrow or not. Best is to wait until the brick has been totally completed.

I am talking regarding HalfTrend indie - as you stated it is a grail. No it is not.....otherwise everybody here in this forum is millionaire...... Pantera1 wrote the MA_shift should be -2, which means arrow appears after 2 bricks in real - on history pictures it is nice, try to set it to 0 and you will see the reality. Trading only with this one indicator is not leading to victory.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I've seen in repainting yesterday on USD/JPY so yes it can get you in a trade and than the arrow disappears. This is mentioned in the info.txt you can use the NRP version that will paint the arrows one bar late. Nothing is a holly grail, the key is the filter the signals. The cycle identifier seems to help, I can't find a use for the FX Bay MACD, it's almost never below zero when the half trend signals a sell or above when buy

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Could kindly better explain how do you filter signals with FxBay MACD ? Thank you

--- 帖子 #478 ---
my post above about the holy grail was just sarcasm. I already know that it repaints and those arrows look good just in hindsight, i told this many time to hutch early on in this very thread.. Hutch is the one fooling noobs here pretending he is trading those arrows live when he himself wasnt aware that his HT is repainting. I hope it is clear now.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Aren't you the clever one for saving all the "noobs" from sure bankruptcy! Once again, you completely miss the point of this thread.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I seem this indicator works like zig-zag, so it repaints on every new high/low.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Bad trades normally occurred when I didn't follow my own rules and this is rare. Bad trades also occurred when I entered into trades when I got a bad signal and this is also rare. Even after having traded since 2005 I'm still learning.

I use STS Renko and it's an indicator made by the creator of this thread.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
That's fine with me, when you backtest such an indicator you should do tick replay.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
No, it does not produce an arrow on every new high/low. If you try it out for a while, you'll see how it works. Read this: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post13219524

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I see the indicator repaints, take a look at these screenshoots on today EURCAD

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I doesn't really matter that it repaints, I could show you how to generate a non repainting range bound cycle index but I need some tick data for that can someone share a week worth of tick data of any pair?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
It allways matter if an indicator repaints. One thing is that the signals moves forward and repaint on the next bars. That is unpleasent, but much worse is when it paints a signal to trade and after a while the trend goes in the opposite direction and then sudently the signal has gone - like if it was never there. In my experiance - never use repainting indicators. Some people have other experiances and I don't want to be judging - just what I have seen over time at many years of tradin.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
It depends if you backtest plotting it on a chart than yes it does. When you do tick reply you need to see if the filtered entries perform better than the non filtered ones that's all I'm in this to make money not for having a perfect non repainting indicator. does the repainting indicator improves the win/loss ratio? if it does than that's all that matters

--- 帖子 #489 ---

I want run a tick replay on a renko chart with various filters, Can someone share some tick data on any pair? my broker provides 1s data but not tick by tick

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I do not talk about test. This is manual trading with real money. You had a fine setup, you traded it and suddently the setup disapear - backwards. The arrow that told you to get into a trade is gone. Vanished! Next thing you know is that the trend does the exact opposite as expected and you are in a loosing trade.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
And you cannot trust back test. Well I run lots of back tests anyway, because they can give a good clue. But take a look at this test. The periode is the whole 2020. Gain on a 10.000$ demo account is 304,625$ Will I win that in 2021?? Never, not a chance. This test is optimized and it would be as if you could buy a Lotto and you knew the winning numbers when buying it. But I have found some interesting settings and I will try them just for the fun of it. Then some people will look at the draw down on 74%. Yea that is dangeruos, but I will not invest 10.000$. Maybe 500$ and I don't give a dam if I lose them. And that really is a possibility - blowing the account big time. Just for the fun :-) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #493 ---
The test is optimized only when you optimize it and can it can always be walk forward tested to have a clue about a future performance, I ran hundreds of tests in the past mechanical entries without discretion are not a good way to trade imo.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Best to avoid the cycle identifier as a confirmation indicator. Stick to Hutch's FX Bay MACD or something similar like a BB MACD (this is a good one: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13340415 )

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I don't see a use for the MACD it's not filtering the signals. It's always in the direction of the renko candle

obviously not users are making profitable trades with it including me

--- 帖子 #498 ---
If you open a trade on an uncompleted Renko brick you're taking a risk. Sometimes the trade works and sometimes it doesn't. Opening a Renko trade always has to be after the current signal brick has closed. I should have emphasized this but I thought that traders using Renko knew this. Please take a look at my answer here: https://www.energyexch.com/thread/po...0#post13350420 and you will see how the FxBay MACD is filtering signals.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Thank you for the explanation. So FxBay MACD positive confirms long trades and FxBay MACD negative confirms short trades, is it correct?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hi Alberto, yes it's correct. As stated above the mistake that some traders make is to enter into a trade on the same brick as the arrow from the Half Trend TT so it's obvious that the brick hasn't closed. A problem is that you might see an arrow on the last brick of a session, like a Friday, and it will not be there when the market opens on Monday since the brick that was started on Friday has now closed on Monday. In that case you might say that the Trend TT repaints. Please take a look at this post and you will see why the Half Trend TT is better than non-repainting Half Trends. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13162815

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I seem it's not possible to place pending stop orders but only market execution orders, do you agree? We need to verify the arrow presence on the previous bar and FX MACD confirmation when we place the order on the next bar.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Does the arrows come with the indicator?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
You could place pending stop orders but the problem is that you don't know if the next brick will be long or short. Invisible wicks increase difficulty. Best it to wait for the FxBay MACD confirmation.

The Half Trend TT comes with the arrows if you configured it to provide arrows. All half trend indicators can show arrows but the problem is knowing how the logic of these indicators work.

Hi, I use pending stop orders. Thanks to this, you can avoid a few traps a day. regards Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Just to clarify, if there is a buy arrow on previous brick, the FX MACD must be immediatly positive at the new bar opening, or can we wait it turns from negative to positive during the bar? In this last case we will have some slippage from previous bar close. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
The FX Bay MACD must be immediately positive otherwise there is a possibility that the arrow was a bad signal. Entering into a trade with slippage is never good because we don't know how far the trade will go before reversing. Sometimes you get an arrow and the next Renko brick goes in the direction of the arrow but the Fx Bay MACD doesn't agree. In that case I just don't initiate a trade. As indicated in post #498 above the FX Bay MACD filters the arrow signals. My system is good but not perfect. If all systems were perfect we would not be talking here because all brokers would already be broke

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Ok, since I can't check the monitor all day long I'll write an expert to open a trade only when there is an arrow on previous bar and previous FX BAY is in accordance.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Please note that the Half Trend TT can provide an alert so there is no need to check the monitor all the time. I'm not a programmer and I wish you luck with producing a good EA.

If you like to use MACD, Range Bars would be the better choice. It has a better PA feeling. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Looks like you're going long or short on the second brick to close above/below the MA, with Stoch confirmation. Am I missing anything else? I like it! What are your re-entry and stop rules? Is this pure stop and reverse?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Has anybody coded this to the point where it can be backtested? I've got to think that one of the best and easiest ways to optimize a system like this comes from adjusting the renko brick sizes. A self-adjusting brick size that reacts to market conditions would be something I'd like to test. Has anybody considered that? What would you base the adjustment on? ADR, or avg measured move between pivots?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Not glorious at all my broker lowered my leverage from 100:1 to 30:1 and this month banned me from trading Bitcoin although it's available for trading for everybody else. This is because of a stupid ESMA rule Bitcoin is no longer available for trading for people living in Europe even if their accounts is in a non-European country. The biggest problem trading my system is the relationship between the Half Trend TT and the FxBay MACD. They must coincide in order to take a trade. Relying only on a Half Trend TT arrows guarantees a loss. Here is a good example the first and third arrows are false signals since the FxBay MACD was positive. No system is perfect but applying the rules helps.

Hello Hutch, I can explain the logic of how the signal is generated in half trend indicator if you wish.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Half trend indicators are normally based on ATR and work the same way as super trend indicators but with a different logic to compute the trend. Some repaint like the Half Trend TT that I use but it has the advantage of providing an early signal of a change in the trend. Some don't repaint but they normally need a few candles more before identifying the trend and, as a result, produce more bad signals. Please see how the Half Trend TT indicator compares with 3 non-repainting Half Trends indicators in this post: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13162815

A while ago I stated that choosing the right brick size was important but like a good priest I don't do everything that I preach I trade Natural Gas using a Renko brick size of 1 pip and it's so frustrating at times that I don't trade. I just checked what would happen if I traded it using bricks of half a pip. The chart looks a lot better. Today the first 2 trades were break even trades so the profit was 4 pips excluding the last arrow signal as seen in the first chart. Had I used bricks of half a pip there would have been the same number of trades but with a better result (second chart). The 2 break even trades in the first chart would have resulted in a profit of 4 half pips each while the 4 pips winning trade would have resulted in a profit of 13 half pips. The result using brick size of half pips would have been 21 half pips or 10 1/2 pips; more than double the result using 1 pip brick size. In addition losing trades would be smaller. I guess that I'm still learning from my mistakes

If your still not convinced that algo trading with renko on mt5 is a decent way to make profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Id say otherwise. I attached the full report in the new thread. Sorry i wont spam this spread anymore

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Here is my 2¢ The spread is 0.6 pip or $60 so to make a profit you need at least a 1 brick profit ($100). If you find a broker with a lower spread please tell us. Yesterday I switched from bricks of 1 pip to bricks of 0.5 pip and although it looks so good while looking at the chart at the end of the day it's much more difficult to trade using bricks of 0.5 pip than trading using bricks of 1 pip. This is because the half trend gives too many signals that later disappeared and this can lead to losses. Don't forget that the maximum ATR for Natural Gas is rarely in excess of 10 pips so it really limits your potential profits. Trading oil is much better since the ATR is more than 250 these days. This is much better than trading currency pairs such as the EURUSD that only has an ATR of 80.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
No matter the platform that you use it's easier to make good profits with Renko than trading on timeframe charts.

That i completely agree. Renko or Range bars is much better than candlesticks

FIRST PART: Bar Data: Trend Down This indicator calculates Ilow of each bar with in which Ilowest is used from array of look back from current bar the look back is determined by Factor setting in the inputs ilow and ilowest are compared to obtain the max value of the two this is called "maximumlowprice" Bar Data: Trend up This indicator calculates IHigh of each bar with in which IHighest is used from array of look back from current bar the look back is determined by Factor setting in the inputs iHigh and iHighest are compared to obtain the max value of the two this is called "minimum highprice" SECOND PART: Trend up Lowma Moving average LOW &amp; high is used to calculate if the price(ma) is above the Bar data Trend down Highma Moving average HIGH &amp; low is used to calculate if the price(ma) is below the Bar data To generate the trend color and direction arrow a logical calculation is made at current bar (0) with if statement: for Up Trend: if(lowma&gt;minhighprice &amp;&amp; Close[i]&gt;High[i+1]) for Down trend: if(highma&lt;maxlowprice &amp;&amp; Close[i]&lt;Low[i+1]) iAtr is used to calculate the position of the direction arrows it is not used in the logic of Trend creation or math Variables and constants are placed in the Inputs tab as extern values Values of both Half trend are at default

Hi Hutch. I like simplicity of this approch. I look at DAX this morning and have one question. If it is a new arrow, MACD cross 0 line , do you wait for renko bar and Halftrend cross? Below are my entries.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
The Half Trend TT gives the signal using the arrow but the trade is always at the beginning of the next Renko brick. At that time you have to make sure that the arrow signal corresponds with the FxBay MACD. It looks like that both pictures show a late entry. Normally the signal should be on the previous brick but if your Renko bricks have wicks it's normal to have late entries. By the way even the best signals will not guarantee a good trade. I just lost $300 trading the S&amp;P 500 because the trend reversed. Oh well ... next

Thanks for the strategy...I'm using it now...curious how do you decide TP and SL? And how do you decide when you trade after a series of up/down half trend signals in a short time span?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I don't have a fixed TP since the exit is after the next valid signal. I use a SL of 1 brick after a new valid signal so the SL is visual. This is exactly what happened yesterday (see post 560). Since I trade the S&amp;P 500 using brick size of 3 ticks I lost $300. Using a lower brick size is too fast while using a higher brick size is too big considering the 10-day ATR is only 52.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Have you tried to use pending stop orders? It happens that the market opens such an order and also returns, but this is a completely different story.

It sure is a different story and I wish I could use pending orders but because I need the Half Trend and the FxBay MACD to match it's not possible.

Please try the old versions they work fine. The STG_RenkoChart is to be put on your source chart while the STG_RenkoChart_Remote is to be put on the Renko chart. By changing the brick size on the STG_RenkoChart_Remote it will automatically change the brick size of the STG_RenkoChart. This is very useful if you want to try different brick size without having to open new charts.

How does one change the brick size? I've downloaded your files and template, but can't figure out where I can choose the brick size. Also, in your info you state it seems to be best to have bricks without wicks. What does a person do to get wickless bricks? thanks for all you do!

Please forgive my ignorance, but are the 2 files attached to this message placed in the indicators folder in mt4? Again, thank-you.

Brick size is the first variable in the STG_RenkoChart indicator; wicks is the fourth variable. To get a 10 pips Renko chart you have to use 10 pips for currency pairs and 100 pips for CFDs such as the one I use for WTI.

The source chart is a 1 minute chart (M1) where you put the STG_RenkoChart indicator. After you have filled the input tab (post #585 above) and Allow DLL Imports (first picture) just click Ok and the offline chart will be created and the STG_RenkoChart indicator will appear at the bottom of the M1 chart and will show the number of pips per Renko brick and the name of the offline chart (second picture). Since the "Offline Timeframe Start" on my input tab is 9 (post #585 above) the name of the offline chart is one digit more M10 (third picture). The command to open the offline chart is "File" "Open Offline Chart" and you will see the chart name that was indicated at the bottom of the source chart. FF put the pictures in the wrong order but you can easily find the right ones.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I have never seen arrow disappearing after 3 bricks but it's possible with 2. Trading only with arrows is totally useless this is why the trade is triggered on the brick following the brick with the arrow and only if it's the same color as the brick with the arrow and the FxBay MACD points in the same direction as the arrow.

M2 does not mean anything by itself for an offline Renko chart; it's just to differentiate it from the others. An offline Renko chart cannot perfectly resemble a classic chart because it is the time it takes to break out of the predefined box in pips or points, to form another candle which will be the common thread; This can take from a few seconds to several hours.

Simple Renko...

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hey guys i'am also back to renko. I traded renko some years ago (like 2years) but i didn't understand market behavior so i thought was shit. After a while using ICT/SMC concepts i had the ideia to see if i could apply to renko. After 3 days of observation and demo account. I started a challange on MFF and I managed to pass in 2 days. The lines are round numbers for gold i use 5$ range and for GU i use 0.25 ranges. XU Today GU Today

Reading this thread I need to make this comment. I am the greatest fan of Hutch and his wisdom there is and his methode is perfect. In that case a robot is a wonderfull tool. Look at the trade at the chart. There are 4 confluences telling that this will be a great trade. An MA cross MACD positive The other indicator positive A Halftrend arrow https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...l?d=1598556348 Sorry it became a link. I tried to copy the chart. The perfect setup. And 4 very firm rules that cannot be mistaken. If I made a robot on that system, then I could go swimming or whatever and I would get all the fine trades. I know people are tired of listning to this robot talk. And people start call me names when writing a post like this. But it is so obvious that robots can do things for you and I have to keep telling you guys. Am I then a lazy man? I use minimum 10 hours before my charts every day and have done that for minimum 10 years. I burn for this and I am not lazy. Will I make this robot for you? No, I will tell you of the opportunity, then you guys should learn to programme EA's if you find it interesting. Manual trading is still very fullfilling, and I do that also. It is part of the excitment of trading.

nozzer, I have attached my fav EA's that allow the offline Renko charts. Be aware that you must collect the currency data before you can add the EA and make an offline chart. cpfleger

nozzer, Add this Script to the MT4 Script Folder and then follow its instructions to capture the currency data before you add any EA / Offline Chart or you will be unhappy. cpfleger

Better indicator for RENKO (Time Frame M4 renko)

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I know - this is a 4 year old post. But have anybody any experiance with XB4? It is obviously repainting, but how bad is it? (See post 54 on page 2) When you look into the MT4 code, it is clearly a theft. And it is hard to say how it works. I will try to dicipher it if the repainting is not too bad. And the property link is: #property copyright "xbox forex" #property link "http://community.strangled.net" I am not trying to open that page!

--- 帖子 #677 ---
It's a noted repainting indicator all right, but I have found some people trade with repainting indicators but use it in agreement with other indicators not as a stand alone. I'm jut taking a second look at it now and hope it combine well wit some other indicators.

Hello everyone, I’d like to share my Renko trading system that I use for prop firms. My system is simple yet effective, utilizing only two indicators: Supertrend and Stochastic. Additionally, I use round numbers and Fibonacci retracement levels (50% and 61%) as confluence factors. Here’s a detailed explanation of my trading approach. Timeframes: I generally use two to three timeframes, but for this explanation, I will focus on two: Higher Timeframe Analysis: Identify impulsive moves and mark the Fibonacci retracement levels. If the price is above the 50% retracement level, I trade counter-trend until it reaches this level. If the price is between the 50% and 61% levels, I look for an entry point for the next impulsive move. Indicators Setup: Two Supertrend indicators. Stochastic oscillator. Pro-Trend Position: Fibonacci Zone: Price should be in the 50% to 61% Fibonacci retracement zone. Stochastic Confirmation: Stochastic should touch or cross below the 20 level for a buy position or above the 80 level for a sell position. Candle Confirmation: The current candle should be in the direction of the anticipated move, and the previous candle should be against it. Wick Condition: The wick of the current candle must exceed the end of the previous candle. Target: The target for this position is the 127% Fibonacci extension level. Counter-Trend Position: Stochastic Divergence: There must be divergence on the Stochastic oscillator, preferably visible on both the higher and lower timeframes. Proximity to Round Numbers: The price should be near a round number for additional confluence. Target: The initial target is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. If the price is making a strong retracement (characterized by many consecutive candles), I close the position at the first candle that moves against the position, below the 50% level. Example with EURUSD: Smaller Timeframe: 2 pips. Higher Timeframe: 4 pips. This system leverages the simplicity of Renko charts to filter out market noise and focuses on key confluence areas to make informed trading decisions. By combining higher timeframe analysis with precise entries on lower timeframes, it aims to maximize profit while minimizing risk. Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback!

Nicely devised and presented. What are they stochastic settings you are using? Thank you for clearly outlining your approach to trading

I forgot to mention in my previous post that I always follow the direction of the Supertrend on the higher timeframe. Here’s how it works: If the 6-period multiplier Supertrend on the higher timeframe is indicating a downtrend, I only look for sell opportunities. If the 6-period multiplier Supertrend is indicating an uptrend, I only look for buy opportunities. The smaller Supertrend on the higher timeframe also helps in identifying good entry points at the beginning of new impulsive moves, which in turn gives me a better risk-reward ratio. Following this approach ensures that I am trading with the overall trend direction, increasing the likelihood of successful trades. Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts!

I like Renko charts....how long you been trading this Goncalo008?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I've been using this system for the past 3 months. A couple of years ago (2 or 3), I also traded with mean Renko and was a student of ZenFx (you can find them on YouTube). But back then, I was a bit of a newbie and didn't understand much about market behavior and structure. Now, after spending a lot of time focused on it, I've realized that market structure with Renko is quite simple. With this system, I've already made some good profits on prop firms, and I've recovered the money I spent last year and in the first few months of this year. I went from a 5k account to a 25k account on FundinPips in 4 challenges. I lost one due to greed and overtrading, but now I'm back on the right track. I usually trade only EUR/USD or XAU/USD. Try using a Renko size similar to M5/M15 for small time frames and M30/H1 for bigger time frames. I usually determine my trade direction on H4 at the beginning of the week. With Renko, I don't experience the FOMO (fear of missing out) that I usually had with candlesticks.

I'll share the custom indicators I use with this system. AKS Risk Reward Long Short - This is the tool that shows the RR positions. Renko Wicks - Since the built-in Renko on cTrader doesn't have wicks, this indicator adds the wicks to the candles. SuperTrend Experto - This is the SuperTrend indicator I use, but there's also a built-in one. Round Levels - it's the indicator that i use for round numbers Stochastic - I use the built-in version. Risk On Trade - This is a cBot (though I know the creator also has an indicator version of it) that works like a position size calculator on MT4. It's paid, but worth the money since it was around $30. Since i can't upload the files here. I created this shared folder. Shared folder Risk on trade page

Hello, I see that there are active comments about renko, I am interested in meeting someone who is passionate about Renko charts to operate with an EA and search for effective configurations automatically. Here I show two EAs that I have currently working on and that their explorers are in my profile in case you want to give them a review.

GN everyone! Today i took this late trades: XAUUSD BUY High timeframe: Bigger supertrend is green Stochastic gave us a v touch on 20 lvl (i can explain this theory) we had a reverse candle (price manipulate the last bearish candle and went up Smaller timeframe: Price have swiped previous lows and retraced right way from the OB. Stochastic was comming from 20 level Price reacted on 2320 level. Missing confluence: Fib retracement
