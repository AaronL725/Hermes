Hi Everyone, I have been trying for the last 4-5 years to find the perfect system. That is the perfect system for me - every trader has his/her own special way of trading or analysing the same peice of information. I want to trade on 1 hr charts as I work from home and I want to be able to decide whether to excute a trade quickly. I can do this with this system in about a minute befroe the new candle opens. I have tried using just price action and also every indicator ever coded but there are two indicators that I keep coming back to. I have gone back over the last year on G/J and I have an 80% success rate. I have concluded on average that in a normal week there will be 5 trades - 4 will win or break even and one will be an outright loser. The avergae loser will be 50 to 60 pips. This means as long as I lock in 60 pips per week I should not have negative week on average. Indicators will follow. This is a screen shot of the places where I executed trades for the week. The buy and sell happened at the close of these candles. I do not have a solid exit as yet - I simply use the average approach - so any comments are welcome for this. In the chart 6 trades I made ended up making a profit (or breaking even) whilst one was a simple loser. Can anyone guess which 2 indicators I used? I will post them if anyone shows and interest. I look forward to peoples thoughts. Al

Since you named the thread "Directional Movement", I'll guess you're using the ADX. It looks interesting. Let us know what you're doing. Thanks

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I tried to come up with soem weird and wonderful name like others have proceeded but I thought lets name what it says on the tin. Quite a clever name which I thought may have tricked people by it's simplicity - obviously not. You are right it is ADX (period 14) combined with another popular indicator. This system is so simple to execute - any ideas on the second indi?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Only one trade this week so far. I personally made 150 pips. This system does work on other pairs on the same average win/loss ratio. You do however have to alter your breakeven/ take profit strategy accordingly. The settings for the indicator can remain the same.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Here it is: I sold on the close of the candle with arrow above it.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Looks good. Tell us how you do it. As far as guessing the other indicator, since it's simple, I'll guess a MA.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Only one person guessing. Well it is simple but also exponential in another kinda way. It is using MACD setting 12,26,9. And these two indis are all you need.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This looks interesting... Do tell us the rules of the system!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
hi there i use this method for over 3 month,,, 6 gmt candle in GBP/GPY and gbp/usd have this behavior if this method use with pivot and psy... points very profitable..U R not first one who discoverd that!!!!!!!.. .. and its better using in gbp/usd...............

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Rules: The rules are as follows: Buy Buy when the following occurs. 1. +DMI is greater than the -DMI -The +DMI has to be greater than a level of 20 2. The ADX has risen since the last bar and is over 20. The only time you can trade when the ADX is under 20 is if it has moved 3 points of it's low 3. No trades when ADX above 40 4. MACD agrees with the move - i.e. MACD is above signal line. Sell Sell when the following occurs. 1. -DMI is greater than the +DMI -The -DMI has to be greater than a level of 20 2. The ADX has risen since the last bar and is over 20. The only time you can trade when the ADX is under 20 is if it has moved 3 points off it's low 3. No trades when ADX above 40 4. MACD agrees with the move - i.e. MACD is above signal line. Exit - I normally use standard s/r or movement in the DMI. Stop loss - Low/High of indicating candle + spread Get to break even around 30 - 40 pips. Like I said this has a good win/loss ratio.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I never cliamed to be the one who discovered it. So many others are crowding their screens with indicators which pretty much tell the same story. All you need are two.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
by the way this is a good system ...i can say thank u for sharin

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Rules: Sorry people I forgot an important item on entry. MACD is only used as a confirmation indicator. If the MACD is not correct at the time you get a signal of DMI/ADX you should leave the trade alone completely until the next set up on DMI. It is tempting to go in after MACD is correct also but in the long run more trades will fail.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
GBP/CHF so far this week 3 trades. Open trade on close of candles marked with arrows.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I have now exited the gbp/chf trade for a 40 pip profit. Onto tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
hey there i used to use DMI, but could never figure it out to reap consistent profits with a high % success. any possibility you could post some screenshots with the indicators and perfect trade examples? interested in this thread...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Do you only use this on hourly charts. I am used to trading shorter timeframes. How do get your trade signals? Do you just check your charts every hour? Thanx

--- 帖子 #18 ---
i am interest with this thread.. hope to get screenprint of chart include indicators..

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi ACartwright, I don't understand your exit rule. Could you explain whtat do you mean with "standard s/r or movement in the DMI"? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Pipping, I will get soem screenshots over shortly. DMI works as the indi that gets you in - rising adx shows the net directional movement in one way or the other. The MACD on the other hand shows the overall trend. In conjunction they compliment each other really well.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I prefer to use this on hourly charts. This is due to wanting maybe 1 to 2 trades a day. This strategy also works on lower time frames with the same sort of % success rate but you iwll have to change your take profit/break even part of the strategy. You will probably get 4-5 trades as result of reducing the time frame.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Jazz, I will get a screenshot of the exits I use over later today. These are discretionary but I do use the indicators to provide a rough idea.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi guys, Screenshot of trade that I am in from this morning. Currently up 156 pips. I have moved my stop so I get at least a 75 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Now it's around 350pips. Great work!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
TX. This system also works effectively on other pairs. You just have to adjust your take profit and break even accordingly. Today it would have worked on a lot of others also. I am confident of its winning %.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi AC, The Label on the chart should read "Buy", as the +DMI and price show? Thanks for a nice and simple system. Herty

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks Herty - Well spotted.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi AC, Please can you post your MACD, mine looks different, Also, that trade you took seems valid for one or two bars previous, to where you took it, any reasons? thanks for posting your system Steve.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Steve, You are correct the trade would have been valid two bars earlier. I trade from 7am GMT to around6pm GMT. If I had taken the trade before I would have to have been up at 4am. No thank you!!!! These trades could be covered with those people cvoering different time zones. I have however found the best times are the ones above. I have attached my MACD also which is differetn to the standard one in MT4. I prefer this one as you have a histogram of the macd and signal line difference which I someitmes use for exits.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
thanks, AC I guessed that might be the reason! Steve.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi guys, These are the cad/jpy trades for this week. 5 trades so far - 2 outright losers. However the other 3 have made some pretty good gains. It is also good to look at basic candlstick formations with this system. This is due to the DMI taking the highs and lows into account and cannot necessarily distinguish candlestick patterns. A candlestick showing a hammer could be shown on the DMI as a good candle - i.e. on a down trend it may have a lower low and a lower high. However it is still hammer and any trade should be taken with caution. Especially if it is this candle that causes the ADX to rise. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I've been demoing this and have done really well. I made a tub of money on the GBP/USD and the EUR/JPY. The USD/CHF gave me a small loss. The EUR/USD also made good money, although I didn't trade it. The SLs and exits need to be firmed up. I'll have to part company on the candle formations. I've found them to be about like reading tea leaves. All-in-all, this looks really good- one of the better ones I've seen. Good work!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Billbss, Glad you had some success. I have posted the usd/chf trade that you may have taken. It is worth noting that if you got in at the right time your position should have been up 33 pips (not inc spread). As this pair does not move as much as some others I would say to have gone to break even after 25-30 pips. Also the indicating candle was rather a large one and these trades are prone to some form of pull back. As for candlesticks and tea leaves - well some people like them and some dont. The good thing about this strategy is the if you get a signal after a large run down it may be best to stay out and play another day. Just like the large indicating candle scenario.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Billbss, I have used a couple of (what seem to be good) exit strategies using DMI and MACD in the past but do not have time to post them today. Maybe tomorrow. Al

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi guys, This is an exit I have been using. The exit strategy relates to the histogram made by the macd and it's signal line. i.e. difference between the two. When there is a down movement (long) or an up movement (short) in the histogram place your take profits on the low of the corresponding candle. I have attached a screenshot. This signals that a reversal (or temporary pull back) is on the cards. This movment normally proceedes a downturn in the ADX - so when you should be getting out of a trade anyway. But it is normally one candle quicker which is always a good thing. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Just to add to the exit strategy. If you do not get taken out on the low of the indicating candle and MACD histogram makes another low simply move the take profit up to the low o fthe next candle and keeping doing so until it is hit. You may find the histogram starts to widen again. Simply follow the same process as before. Hope thats clear as mud.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hey thanks for posting up some examples, the reason why this system wasn't working for me was because i wouldn't let my profits run but always take a certain take profit. so even IF the failure rate was high (not saying it is) because of the high Reward/Risk ratio it works out, i'll b backtesting this....it looks like the 1 hour timeframe is good for it too.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
1hr timeframe is to keep the amount of trades down and to keep the "noise" to a minimum. It also allows you to look over the last 4 days so you can get a visual of the overall trend and any s/r that may crop up.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
For a long position do u wait for both lines to cross above on the MACD histogram or just the yellow? and vice versa for a short

--- 帖子 #40 ---
ACartwright please send a temlate of your system , it will help me Thank you

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Pipping, The MACD has to be above signal for long and below for short. The histogram will be positive for long and negative for short. I do not take into account if MACD line is above/below the zero line. Hope that answered your question.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi gav, I will post template tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Gav, Please find template. You will need to install the macd on one of the earlier posts and also this indicator for it to work. Any problems let me know. Al

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Everyone ok on the exit strategy that I use?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This is another expamle of taking profit and moving stop based on MACD. This pair was eur/chf which showed a valid trade on 19th Feb. I was on this page discussing a trade with my dad so thought I woudl post it - even though I dont actively trade this pair. Hope it helps. Any probs let me know.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi guys, Live trade at moment. Eur/Usd - sold on close of last candle. All conditions met.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Dont worry keep on .trading direction of the trend is the ideal way to trade forex.u are on ur way to doing well. i have the most powerful of this system strategy with a method and the time for it trade offers. the right pair is GBP/YEN.Imade over 800pips from ending of last week to this week monday.and the efficiency is 95% i 9 to 11 offers a month ,4 could neutralise (i.e no loss in that trade and no profit) and 7 could turn the profit. i loss rarely.so still keep on u will get a more powerful strategy of the system.yes the indicators are just two but mine are not same as urs .one of mine is MA and i uses scale.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks - I think I understnad what you are trying to say.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
It's been a good day today. The best news was usd/jpy in which the MACd made sure we did no enter the two trades indicated by DMI. Gbp/usd went for 50 pips (which I did not trade) I did have a trade on eur/usd which went to b/e. I always have a habit of picking the wrong ones.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
GBP/USD trade today

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I don't see a trade, according to your rules. The ADX did not rise all day on that pair.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Bill, My stream from FXDD showed the ADX rising on this bar compared to the last. I think there are times when it shows and sometimes when it doesn't depending on peoples data coming in. On my charts the this was the case. It was not the best trade to get into in the end - however it wouldnot pose too much trouble either. Al

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks Baz.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Good enough. I had been watching it on an IBFX platform and it stayed flat.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
To ACartwright: Did you ever think about turning this indicator into an expert advisor ? Pretty straightforward entry and exit criteria's make this an excellent candidate for an EA. Just thinking of people that would like to trade your system but do not have the time to watch the markets during the day. Let me know your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Billbss It may be best for the rise in adx to be clear on peoples data feed. My ADX rose by 0.108 which is a nominal rise. Something to look out for. The positive thing is that if you had of got in long you would not have been in too much trouble.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi Caputoe, I have thought about turing this into an ea but have not done so for a couple of reasons: 1. I trade this manually - like I said on previous posts I look at the charts at 10 minutes before the hour ends and then I place my trade dependent on the criteria. 2. I use a combination of exit strategies that coud be hard to program into an EA. These include standard s/r and pivot points. However that being said the use of MACD or DMI could potentially be programmed. 3. Sometimes I exit on a potential candlestick pattern (Billbss will like this! - lol!) If you want to start to look at this as an option please feel free to do so. I started this thread as none of the other discussions looked at the DMI. I wanted people to see that when it is used with another trend indicator how effective it could be. DMI has been a favourite of mine since the start. Hiope that answers your question.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Baz, I have just used your indicator and thought that it would signal the ADX rising over 20 or 3 off the bottom. Instead it shows the DMI crossing. This is not to be confused with ADX. The arrows in themselves do not show the best time to buy/sell.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Sorry Mate Please all other traders who foolow this method,ignore that indicator.....really sorry baz

--- 帖子 #61 ---
This is the best laugh I have had all week. "I'll have to part company on the candle formations. I've found them to be about like reading tea leaves". Really, tickled me for some reason, perhaps because I am British and my grandmother read tea leaves occasionally.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Only one trade today on eur/usd. I personally missed this one due to doing something else at the time. It is best to stay out if you have missed the signal originally.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
aud/usd was a good trade today. Not normally a pair that I trade but the system gave antoher solid signal to sell on the close of the candle that I have highlighted.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
valid signal on gbp/usd. Will be interesting to see how this one pans out. I would be a little dubious of entering as price has made a long charge with no real pull back. Also it is late in the day of uk trading. We shall see. It should have got to break even at the worst.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
my trade is all manually done. i want u to tell me how i can get the arrow in my platform in accordance with my strategy.i am not a computer programmer ,how do i do this? i know that u have made some money this time on sell the sell trade ....lol lucky

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks for posting the details of your system, ACartwright. I haven't seen anything so far about the initial stop placement, or movement of stops as the trade progresses. I am making the logical assumption of placing the initial stop behind the latest swing high/low. (See the attached chart) I understand your exit rule "When there is a down movement (long) or an up movement (short) in the histogram place your take profits on the low of the corresponding candle." In the mean time it might be wise to trail the stop behind 2 or 3 closed bars to guard against any explosive move against your position while waiting for the exit condition to occur. What do you think? By the way, I am (temporarily) in profit 103 pips on that trade as I write.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Dave, The exit strategy is a little rough as I do not have any hard and fast rules. I simply move my position on feeling. Often I reduce the stop in line with the following candles high/lows and try to get to b/e when it is possible (without compromising my position. As for the initial stop loss this can be either be in relation to the last swing high/low or I use the high/low of the indicating candle. In theory a downtrend is a series of lower highs and lower lows - a stop should not be hit when you are in the trend - I do however leave a little room just in case of the pip hunters. I am glad that you have had early success so far and look forward to your commetns going forward.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
GBP/JPY - Trade I just got into. Sold on indicating candle with a take profit at first support level at 146.00. In and out for approx 60 pips.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Results today so far from the more "major" pairs. Cad/jpy - -53 outright loss Gbp/chf - +118 max (still live) Gbp/chf - +80 max Gbp/usd - +44 max Eur/jpy - +210 max Eur/usd - +48 max It would have been very difficult not have made pips today.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Just calculated other pairs as follows: usd/jpy - +41 max chf/jpy - +135 max eur/gbp - +81 max

--- 帖子 #71 ---
hi acartwright, great system you have there. may i know how long have you been using this system (no offense)? and what do you mean when you said breakeven is 30-40 pips (under your rules)? and upon entry, you will take the high or low of that entry bar as your initial stop levels? tks....

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi there, In answer to your questions: 1. Once trade is up 30-40 pips try to move stop loss to b/e. 2. Stoploss goes on high of indicating candle for short and low of indcating candle for long. 3. I have been playing around with the DMI for around 4 years and have demoed using confirming indicators. The MACD is the best one I have found. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
This is a very simple yet powerful trading system that I will try it for sure! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
The best way to look at it is to scroll the prices off your screen completely. Then mark where you would get into the trades based on the strategy. When this is done reveal the price - you will see a positive result.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
thanks v much for swift reply. been using adx to trade euro for sometime as well but not as consistent as compared to your system. and one last question, do you just look at one time frame ie the 1 hour time frame? tks

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I use this strategy on hourly due to the reasons in my first post. This does work on any time frame and any pair. You just have to alter your exit strategy accordingly dependent on pair as some move further than others.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
tks acartwright. hopefully am able to can post some results using your system soon. tks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Is the ADX indicator posted in the thread? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Can you show a screen shot of how you trade this? Thanks

--- 帖子 #81 ---
No problem wasnt trying to get sidetracked just curious if you two trade it the same way. I marked 2 entries on here, is this what your looking for? Thanks alot for sharing!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
No problem todder. The first one is correct but the second is a bar late. Also it is worth pointing out again that if you get a signal on DMI and MACD is not right you leave the trade completely and wait for a new set up on DMI.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
hi AC.. wat a nice n simple system u have put and looks very profitable..i have noticed on your chart during 9 to 21 time or your broker chart you have a vertical line and a yellow horizontel line,can u elaborate more bout that..definately gonna try this system.. many thank in advance

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I had a profitable day yesterday. For someone with experience with this system it could have been great. Here is a short entry on the USDJPY today about an hour before the London session open. It looks a little risky sitting right on top of S1, but it did break through later, so it may work out. We will see. I'm attaching a "MTF_MACD_inColor" indicator I'm using that makes it easier to see when the MACD histogram is above or below the zero line. It's the same as the standard one except it colors the histo bars as they appear above or below. It doesn't change the system any, it just makes it easier on the eyes.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Bexter, That just indicates the London open time to London close. The yellow line shows the open price. It's just for a visual.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Dave, Thanks for posting that indi - hopefully it will allow other to clearly see when MACD confirms. I am glad that you had a profitable day yesterday and hope that you locked some profit. In reference to s/r pivot points I have noticed that this system does not really take much notice of the support and resistance. This is due to it being more on momentum - i.e. rising adx showing momentum in price. What I do look out for is price action s/r. This is a lot more signifcant and often use it come out of positions.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Anyone in usd/jpy should be at b/e - this trade has already gone for 38 pips.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Al, I just spotted your new thread...it looks VERY promising. BTW, anytime you see Billbss finding success with a system, ya just KNOW it'll be worthwhile! Thanks for sharing...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Bobcat, No problem sharing and yes I saw him lurking a couple of times!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Sorry if this has been answered before, but I don't understand what you mean by "3 points off its low". Please elaborate and thanks.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
hi acartwright....just wondering for instance, say there's a bullish crossover (+dmi&gt;-dmi and +dmi&gt;20), macd also above signal. and adx fell initially say from 31 to 29 but then later at end of next bar, it jumps up to 30....do we still take the long trade (even if adx is trading in the highs of 20s or in the region of 30s)? tks.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
For me, I wouldnt take because forex is full of RISK

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi Todder, Sorry to take so long ot reply - DMI can be found in MT4 standard indis.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi bobcat, To answer your question. 3 off its low means that you can trade if the adx is below 20. As long as it has moved 3 off of its low point. Ie. ADX goes from 15.8 to 17.4 to 19.1 - the 19.1 candle becomes the signal candle and a trade should be executed in the direction of the DMI. Likewise the adx can go 18.2 to 20.2 - this then is a trade straightaway on the 20.2 candle as adx is now over 20. HOpe that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi sholmes, Yes that would be a trade as adx has risen. You have to be careful with these trades as the adx has a finite way to travel. In theory adx travelling from a lower level has a "potential" to travel further. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank you for your seemingly irrelevant post.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
yes acartwright....understood what you mean. and tks very much again.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Sholmes, I have found a recent trade example in answer to your question.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I used my platform's assisted programming to write a program to illustrate and follow the rules by your system. I'm not a programmer but if there is a programmer there that can use this or possibly write a an ea for it then I hope this should help. I have also backtested this system over the last 3 months and it came with a profit where setting this on a 40 pip stop loss MAX and exit on MACD crossing. with a 1% of capital management on lot size. The script below is only for long's but I guess this could also be done for SHORT's The system I used is IT-finance ProBuilder REM Buy indicator1 = DIplus[14](close) indicator2 = DIminus[14](close) c1 = (indicator1 &gt; indicator2) indicator3 = ADX[14] c2 = (indicator3 &gt; 20.0) indicator4 = ADX[14] c3 = (indicator4 &lt; 40.0) indicator5 = MACDline[12,26,9](close) indicator6 = ExponentialAverage[9](MACDline[12,26,9](close)) c4 = (indicator5 &gt; indicator6) IF c1 AND c2 AND c3 AND c4 THEN BUY 1 %CAPITAL AT MARKET THISBARONCLOSE ENDIF REM Sell indicator7 = MACDline[12,26,9](close) indicator8 = ExponentialAverage[9](MACDline[12,26,9](close)) c5 = (indicator7 &lt;= indicator8) IF c5 THEN SELL AT MARKET THISBARONCLOSE ENDIF

Hi Deltaworld, Thanks for the post and the interest in this thread. EA and Proram is like a 747 going over my head. I will get my dad to look at the programming side - he is a dab hand and is also into forex trading. Glad you have had some positive results.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
The best exit strategy that I have found is stil using the subtle changes in the macd histogram. This is due to it showing the closes moving back to the 9 period ma.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
hi acartwright, yes your usdcad attachment reflects the similar situation which i encountered. i did take the trade but it a an emotional ride as price came just 2 pips off my stop before recovering to enable me to take a modest 30 pips profit. was trading euro. also would like your advice say if there's a bearish crossover, +dmi is 15, -dmi is 25 but adx declined say from 20 to 19 but at end of next bar adx went up from 19 to 21.5 but -dmi has shrunk from -25 to -23 while +dmi from 15 to 13. with the -dmi value declining from -25 to -23, is it still a valid short trade to take? tks

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I would always wait until I got a +DMI reading over 20 for long and -DMI reading over 20 for short. When DMI is below 20 the price action is often choppy. Also when DMI goes above and then below 20 you should be tightening stops.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
ok, so as long as +dmi or -dmi stays above 20, we can still take trade even if +dmi/-dmi values have decreased from prev bar. tks

--- 帖子 #105 ---
When you get a decrease in DMI it simply means that the current bar failed to make a higher highs or lower lows. OR it has made a higher high or a lower low but not in proportion with the last candles low/high. Hope that makes sense. Sometimes the changes in DMI reflect swing highs and swing lows. Clear as mud?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
yes understood. but tks once again for your clarifications. anyway, was watching euro 1h chart &amp; saw the bullish crossover with indicating bar's +dmi&gt;20 &amp; its adx increased to 21 from 18. was wondering if i am right to enter long here? tks. 1.3315 entry &amp; after that, it made low at 1.3277....still awaiting trade to develop.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
me too... get caught at BUY 1.3315.... EUR/USD 1H

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I have just looked at the trade you have taken and it is a valid trade based on the criteria. I mentioned in the early posts that you have to be careful with the signal candles. This includes the actual size of the candle. The indicating candle in this instance had a range of 62 pips - which is quite large for an hourly eur/usd bar. With such large bars it is likely that there is a retracement. In this case there was a pull back but your original stop should not have been hit until you were at least 20 pips in profit. At this point with this type of trade it may have been best to move to breakeven as the trend had temporarily ceased as per the "rounding off" of the macd and the +DMI falling back to the 20 area. On the flip side - the stop loss has not yet been hit - the lows have become static at 13275 - it might be best to keep the original stop loss in place. Hope that helps.

I entered a Live trade using your strategy. According to the closed candle indicated by the 2 vertical red bars, this was the indicating candle As the ADX was above 20, +DI&gt;-DI and +DI&gt;20 and ADX was rising since last candle Also the MACD confrimed the trade.. the trade was then entered at 148.753 The Stop Loss was set at the low of the indicating candle + Spread at 148.401 I was meant to set it to BE when it had reached +40 pips but it had never reached that. It had since hit the Stop Loss I just wanted to check that these are the correct parameters and this was just one of those losing trades. OR I should have set a larger stop loss due to the volatility of this pair. P.S. I had a winning trade this morning with USD/CAD at +28 pips This trade was a -36pip Trade So far Live Balance Strategy is at -8 pip trade Any suggestions on how of avoided this trade to being a losing trade if possible. P.S. I use the THV System Indicator by CobraForex to assist me on entering the trade within the hour for fine tuning entry trades by scaling down to 5M or even 1M charts. That is what the bottom indicator is on chart

Hi Deltaworld, The gbp/jpy trade that you took was not a valid trade as far as the system goes. I am able to see why you took it and I did not however. The settings on your MACD are not the default 12,26,9. If you had used these parameters you may have stayed out of the trade completely. And all in all could be up 28 pips from your other trade . Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi ACartWright Yes I can see now that my settings for the MACD were not the default ones. I don't know why they were set at the previous settings. I guess I didnt change them when I installed the custom colour indicator. I have now changed them. I have also entered EUR/JPY trade at 131.504 SHORT according to this strategy. I have also set SL. to BE when it hit +40 pips. For more volatile pairs (cross Yen pairs especially) do you still set BE at +40 pips? P.S.: Potential Trade Entry for EUR/AUD Long to strategy rules over the next 1-2 hours

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi Delta, Moving to b/e after 40 pips is normally a good move on the more volatile pairs - not necessarily the yen pairs as usd/jpy an chf/jpy do not move as much as pound/yen eur/yen etc. I also sometimes take profit after 40 pips if price has hit s/r for example or it looks like the trade wil lturn back. I have also exited after 40 pips if I am down for the day if it brings me to break even for the day. So all in all there are a lot of factors involved. What I like about these two indicators is that they based on different inputs. MACD is based on closing prices and DMI is the high/lows and net directional movement. Also in regard to your eur/yen trade you have to be careful of large candles that become signal candles - pound/yen eur/yen I would not enter on a cnadle that showed a signal if its range was say over 100 pips. You could be putting your self in a compromised position resulting in a pull back. Hope that the above helps.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi ACartWright I have posted the chart for the BE trade for Eur/JPY 1. There was a big candle that was validated by the strategy 2. Entry SHORT at 131.508 at close of indicating Candle 3. Stop Loss Initially set to High + Spread of Indicating Candle 4. The Price moves to 131.045 setting the trade to +42.3 Pip 5. The SL is now moved to BE 6. Price Action moves and bounces back up to BE and the trade is closed at 0pips P.S. I have since monitored the pair since posting the chart and the price is now 131.218 and would have been +25pips had the SL not moved to BE. Any suggestions on how to manage the movement of the Stop Loss from its initial point to BE on this trade or other similar trades?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi ACartwright I have noticed you have answered a lot of my queries from the last post that I had posted. Thank you very much. I have another question in regards to moving the stop loss to BE. Is that normally done during the hour of the +40 pip trade or is that done at the end of the forming candle. e.g. Enter trade at 17:00 at 17:25 +40 pips 18:00 now at +25 pips SL not moved 19:00 now at +54 pips SL moved to BE OR Enter trade at 17:00 at 17:25 +40 pips SL moved to BE 18:00 now at +25 pips 19:00 now at +54 pips

Hi Delta, I would go to break even when ever the price gets to its target mid bar.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Delta, It is a tricky thing to move stop losses to break even at the correct time. I think it is best to look at the indicators overall and when the price gets to break even. I.E if it gets to break even at the end of the candle you can look at what the indicators are suggesting. If it is at the beginning you may want to lock in straightaway and hope for a continued move. The exit is always the problem as you will never know how far price will go. In an ideal world I would close 50% of the trade off when a s/r target is made and then move to b/e on the rest. Unfortunately I am in the process of building my account so I take profit as and when. Sorry to be so vague. I have attached a chart to try and explain.

I left it running overnight with a trailing stop loss and I exited the trade this morning at .57865 I entered another trade this morning but I got caught out again by the GBP/JPY, I might stay clear of this pair (too volatile for me) One thing that I had noted.. Is I have added another indicator (I know the idea of this thread is to keep things simple and not overcomplicate with too many indicators). But I noticed the RSI was oversold (after I had entered the trade. so.. In future it might be a good idea to avoid trades where the RSI is at overbought/oversold point. I have attached the THV RSI indicator I am eyeing entry on the hour for GBP/CHF. It meets all the criteria for a valid trade to the strategy rules edit: According to the last Indicator posted. THV RSI v2.ex4 This pair looks overbought. I have decided not to enter the trade. Edit: I have SHORT EUR/GBP 0.88695

Hi Delta, I did not have a trade on gbp/jpy - can you post a screen shot?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Delta, On my screens the eur/gbp is not valid as the MACD is not below the signal line. Does your data feed show different?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I noticed that as soon as I entered the trade.. oops.. need to pay more attention to reading the signals. I have attached the GBP/JPY chart. I have rechecked the signals on this chart.. they all seem to follow the strategy's rules.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Delta, I trade from 7 am gmt which is translated to 9 am on my charting software. I would not have taken the gbp/jpy trade as there was not a continuous increase in the adx - it had a little blip which was not in line with the rest of the move. Also when I trade from 7.00 am I look to see how far the pair has moved and if there is any s/r or likely retracement. This would have been at discretion however.

--- 帖子 #125 ---

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Should have stayed in Like I say you never know!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Yep you are right.. in my demo account I left it open.. but my live account I closed it. I'll probably re-enter again if the conditions are right at the end of this hour.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
The current candle has a range of 50 pips so be careful. It is also coming upto support at 8828.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I've re-entered the trade Live at 8837 with +14pips so far. I have set the limit to a resistance level measured at 8794 with stop at 8883.4 ACartwright, I notice that you are a UK resident like myself, what platform do you use for trading, and why? if you don't mind me asking. I use IGIndex as a spread betting platform, they have tight margins and I can trade from 50pence per pip which is an acceptable size for myself.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Delta, I use IG index also - like you mention I find it very flexible.

eur/gbp stops should be tightened. Just a feeling.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello, AC. Interesting system you have here. Thanks for sharing it. I just plopped your template on a EUR/USD chart to take a look and found what appear to be several sell signals (perhaps too many). So I'm wondering if I am interpreting your rules correctly. Please take a look at the attached chart and see what you think. White boxes surround what appear to be valid signals to me. The first would have been a clear loss. The second would have been a nice trade. The third would have been a loss. And the fourth would be in progress yet (though the signal was a hammer candle so maybe you would have avoided it). Would these be trades you would have taken, or am I missing something? Thanks for your time. Scott

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Eur/GBP ended with a very tidy profit of +68.8 pips I have my eye on Cable LONG on the hour. Could you please let us know if this is a trade you would consider entering.. and if not.. why not. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I was looking at that one as well.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I've entered that now at 1.49804 with tight stop loss at 1.49528 I have set my target to 1.503 Also the fundamental's agree with it as the dollar is weak now after the production values and normally this carries on till day end or sometimes the following day. Technical analysis views below too. Trading Central Quotes GBP/USD intraday: the bias remains bullish. Pivot: 1.483 Our preference: Long positions above 1.483 with targets @ 1.503 &amp; 1.511 in extension. Alternative scenario: Below 1.483 look for further downside with 1.4775 &amp; 1.4725 as targets. Comment: the pair has broken above its resistance and is pulling back on its new support ahead of a rebound.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I'm in at 1.4985, including spread. SL set to 1.4949. I have no TP set but will move to BE if trade goes positive by 25 pips. Looks a bit dicey at the moment as to which way it will go. Scott

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Potential setup on euro/chf? Strong s/r region.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I believe this pair is not a valid setup but it would be best to check with the ACartwright. The reasoning for this setup not being valid is the ADX has decreased since the last candle and looks like it will carry on decreasing. Which means that the trend is winding down to a flat non-trend or is due to reverse. If it starts to rise again and as long as it is below 40 and above 20 then this should be valid. Also on my charts the MACD is still signaling a BUY.. not a SELL but this looks like it may change by hour end.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
So if on the close of this candle, if the Macd has crossed over, it would still not be a valid entry unless the adx line has turned north?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Delta, This trade would have signalled at 16.00. Sorry taken a while to come back to you.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Henry, They look fine as signals - but try and remember we are trading london session so from 8 am ish to 6pm is GMT. One of your losing signals was early in the morning.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Plasma, Delta is correct. The ADX needs to be rising and above 20 with the MACD in agreement. Currently neither indicator is giving a proper signal.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi Henry, Fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Guys, I believe that you got into the gbp/usd trade a candle to late. It may have been dependent on you data feed. Mine showed the sginal at 16.00. Do you have anything different? Al

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Ok, thanks AC. I am in the US and am sleeping during the London, but 6PM GMT is early afternoon here, so I can at least trade this during the entire NY session. You ever tried this on the 4H timeframe? Just curious. Scott

--- 帖子 #146 ---
For that bar, my ADX was showing 18.65, and it had not increased 3 from its low, thus I waited until the next bar. I am on IBFX, by the way. I have two positions open, one set for a TP of 25 (which it came within 2 pips of) and the other set to be taken out by MACD. We'll see... Scott

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Henry, I have only looked at possible trades on the 4hr charts not taken any live. The reason for this is based on the system the sl goes at low/high of indicating candle. 4H candles can be very large. Also I have settled on the 1 hour charts as they often provide regular (not too many) singals which means if you miss one you can get on the next. This strategy works on any time frame and on any pair but as I mentioned in earlier post b/e and tp have to be adjusted accordingly.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Henry, IBFX can give slightly different digits as experienced by another member on here. I have actually looked at the figures since and the long signal on my charts came from the massive down candle.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hit TP on first position and doing well on second. A great first live trade with your system. Scott

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi ACartwright Yes you are right. I just was not able to enter the trade due to being in a trade already.. I like to money manage my live account to have only 1 trade running at a time. (unless I am BE or in +sl) with other trade. But is it right that with this strategy, it is still ok to enter a trade a candle late?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Delta, I just posted to henryfam that the actual inicating candle was the large down candle according to my charts. It was this one that moved the adx to above 20. Here is a screenshot on another entry set up. If ADX is right but the MACD and DMI (Not above 20) are not correct wait for the DMI to go above 20 and then check the MACD. If it is good enter the trade. Hope that makes sense. Al

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Delta, Sorry I did not answer your question - I went on about MACD not agreeing etc. Your question was about entering late even when indis are correct even in the begining. As a normal rule of thumb you can take the trade but you may want to adjust tp and sl as a result. It is always bes to get in on the signal candle.

I have set my cable now to B/E and entered USD/CAD and exited USD/CAD.. with a -27.6 pip loss my cable hit B/E even too.. it's just not my day. lol

Hi Delta, When did you get in on usd/cad? I went shot at 12078. Ended up makinig 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I entered USD/CAD late as I was in the Cable. I entered USD/CAD 2 candles late at close of Green Vertical Bar. Should have entered at close of Purple Vertical Bar (ADX has risen by 3 from low) In regards to entering a trade 1 or 2 candles late from the signal.. Do you set the Stop loss to the high+spread of signalling candle e.g. the purple vertical Bar? I have attached the usd/cad image Entered cad at S12025.8 exited at 53.4

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi Scott I hope AC doesn't mind me responding to this post as I think AC might have missed it as I have missed it. And AC, If I am wrong about what I recommend or say please correct me. In accordance to the strategy rules and the signals that you have, they all seem to be valid. All of them would have got you a +pip movement depending on your SL movement and money management techniques (which I still need to refine)

--- 帖子 #157 ---
[quote=deltaworld;2671365]I entered USD/CAD late as I was in the Cable. I entered USD/CAD 2 candles late at close of Green Vertical Bar.

This strategy is designed to get you in as quick as posibble and to b/e as soon as possible. Then giving you the freedom to tp at s/r levels or whenever you choose. I would say to stay out of a trade if you have missed the original signal. If you do ge tin late the sl shoudl be on the indicating candle low/high which at that point could be a few pips away.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Delta, I did repsond to Scott in one of the previous posts. Your comments are correct.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Just so if anyone is wondering I can spell It's just that most of the day I am writing documents with automatic spelling. Hope that is okay.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
AC, is this something that must always be considered before taking a trade, i.e. that a candle in the opposite direction may have been what caused the ADX to tick up? If that is the case, do you leave such trades alone? The G/U trade worked out ok for me (took profit on one position and B/E on second), but I just wanted to know going forward. Cheers, Scott

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Scott, Its a good question. In my opinion if a down candle has a high higher and a higher low in an uptrend it is still a valid signal - (obviously reverse in down trend). This is because this is what defines a trend. I normally put the stop loss in the same position. i.e. low or high of indicating candle but often look to see if the low or high has come back to a s/r line. I then put my stop there. These normally result in a high reward to risk. If the down candle is one of the candlestick formations (hammer or hanging man) I sometimes wait for the break of the high or low for entry. Hope that helps. With so many pairs you can be very selective.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
3 pairs to keep your eyes peeled over the next 1hr-2hrs, that could develop into qualifying trades. The First pair is the good old dragon,GBP/JPY The +DI is over 20 and ADX is 17.14 at the moment.. its lowest was 14.99.. so as long as this candle or the next candle finishes at 17.99 or higher then this qualifies as a signal EUR/JPY is also looking promising as a LONG entry with ADX low of 15.04, again as long as the candle finishes with ADX of 18.04 or higher and all the other indicators are valid then this should be promising. CHF/JPY is at ADX 15.18 LONG

--- 帖子 #163 ---
If there is a break of 149.25 on the current candle it could be explosive north gbp/jpy Well spotted Delta. Just for everyones info my ADX read 15.50 at the low so please be advised. Also it is not within London session so there is discretion on this trade.

Parabolic SAR Stop Loss Strategy I have been doing a lot of backtesting on previous trades that I have entered live or demo traded that I have either exited the trade at Break Even or I have exited the trade at a loss and looking at ways of fine tuning these trades to maximise profits and at the same time minimise the exposure to risk over time. I have toyed with the use of Parabolic SAR before and have used it as exit strategies but this indicator as shown in the many diagrams that I have below becomes very effective with a trending pair. The Parabolic SAR becomes ineffective when there is no trend. So tie this in with the use of this strategy and the ADX indicator with the +DI and -DI then you have a winning formula. The default values for the Parabolic SAR work fine but these may need to be fined tuned, depending on the TF you are using and the pair that you are using, but in most cases the default values work. The default settings of Parabolic SAR are: Minimum Acceleration: 0.02 Acceleration Step: 0.02 Maximum Acceleration: 0.2 Let me clarify, I'll walk you through each of the charts to explain fully. CADJPY Chart As you can see there is a rising trend and you would have got into it about half way with this indicator. With the original stop loss method on my demo trade I was stopped out at the candle indicated. Instead if a Parabolic SAR was setup then you can move the stop loss with the SAR and you would have stayed in the trade and have a larger profit margin. EURAUD Chart Another Example as above, in my demo trade I got stopped out early, with SAR I would have stayed in. and there was a further move down. Even using a standard trend line you can see that one of the candles had opened outside of the trend line drawn but yet it still moved down, with the SAR in place it kept us in the trade. EURJPY Chart There are 2 arrows here Arrow 1: In Arrow one you can see that this is where I had exited a live trade at Break-Even. With Parabolic SAR the trade would still be in and you would have gained a great drop in price action, as indicating by the large candle formation straight after I was stopped out. Arrow 2: This is where Parabolic is not perfect and the settings mentioned above can be fined tuned for the pair as the Parabolic SAR got us out early when the down trend had remained. But it is always better to be safe than sorry. USDCAD Chart In this example I was in a live trade but I got stopped out early with a -pips, again with the use of SAR I can see that I would have still been in the trade but a strong support has formed round about point of entry and the bottom wicks of the candles have lined up. This gives me a strong indication to get out at the bottom wick of the current candle, which would have been Break Even or a 2-5 pips in profit depending on entry and risk take. EURGBP Chart Now in this chart, The Parabolic doesn't work in our favour and keeps us in a trade that is now moving sideways, whilst with the original stop loss method we would have gotten out earlier. There are two ways we can manage this. 1. The first way, is when we do realise that we are in a sideways moving pair we can determine the support and resistance of the moving channel and exit the trade (on a SHORT) at the bottom wicks of the candles to maximise profit 2. Using other indicators and other methods to determine end of trend or reversal. A : ADX Breakout: We can see that I have drawn a red trend line just below the smooth up trending ADX we can see that this has broken on the following candle which is an indicator to get out. B : Courtesy of CobraForex I have the THVTrix 4.0 indicator which is a very useful indicator and the fast trix as you can see has turned green which is an indication that it the trend has ended or is due to reverse. C : THV RSI V2, courtesy of the THV team. (or any RSI indicator will do) again we have an RSI breakout and this is another indication that the trend has broken from the red trend line that I have drawn on the RSI GBPJPY If you notice the downtrend in this trade. I had entered a live trade on this account and thank god for the effective Stop Loss management because about an hour into the trade, the pair had suddenly reversed and I was stopped out with a -36 pip loss. Which I understand, you can't win them all. Now if I had used the Parabolic SAR technique I would have suffered a -28 pip loss, not much in it, but what I am trying to show here, is that the use of the Parabolic is not riskier than the original technique. If you have noticed a trend reversal due to fundamental's or was expecting one from another strategy or indicator.. then this is a point where you can SAR (Stop And Reverse) and where you exited the trade, if you had entered the trade as a LONG.. you would have profited from a trending range and have many pips in your account. Of course, there is a more of a risk element here as the Parabolic Stops are more distant from entry and price than the previous technique but as the name suggests Parabolic, is that they do tighten up as the trend runs out of steam, If used effectively I believe that this can definately maximise your profits but at the same time keep the losses to a minimum. I have yet to test this with hard fact figures, but from what I have seen on previous trades, this would have been a winner. Again, comments or suggestions or even ideas on how this can be improved would be great.

Good Morning Al. Any good trades you are in or developing on this strategy? I entered AUD/USD live trade at 2am UK 7309.4 and closed at 7263.4 at the Parabolic SAR with a -46pip loss. I've been looking to see why the sudden change in trend and it looks like a news event that I was not aware of: Quoted from DailyFX "af ter China's GDP at 6.1% fell short of expectations, reflecting the slowest growth in ten-years. AUD-USD, which had fallen just short of re-testing recent highs at 0.7316, dropped back to 0.7248" I'm in a demotrade of SHORT eur/jpy and that is doing very well at the moment with a +125pip movement. I seem to be doing greatly on my demo account whilst my live account is suffering. I think I know what it is, I seem to be taking profits too early on my live account afraid of the trend reversing. I should just have faith in the system and let it run, plus I guess a bit of bad luck as with that last trade, I couldn't see how I would have foresaw the release of the news event. It wasn't even on forex factory as a scheduled event release.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi Delta, I am currently in a chf/jpy trade which is +32. I put the stop loss slightly higher than the indicating candles high so am fortunate to be still in it. As for some comments to your last post I would never consider trading outside London session and on the hours where New York is ending it's day. The reason is that it goes very flat. ADX DMI and MACD can be affected by very small candles as a result. I would stick to London session as this is where "the money" trades. Moves are bigger which means we can get to break even asap. This will stop you potentially overtrading and buying into false moves. In repsonse to news events you are never going to have a trade where there is no news announced. What you need to be careful of is major news and understand how any "good" or "bad" news will affect the trade. Also you will never know when a big institution will cash a cheque in foreign courrency for a few billion - all affecting price. In regard to coming out of a trade early - well exiting a trade is the hardest thing of all. You never know when price will retrace or do you? I try to get to b/e when it is sensible to do so - this would be when the indicators are still confirming the move up or down whether it is mid candle or at the end. I will then look for notable s/r and draw a line on my chart. I TP when this line is hit. Before I look at a trade I look at the s/r and see if I can get to b/e with say 30 - 40 pips in the bag. Hope those comments help.

Hi Al The reasoning behind the entrance of AUD/USD outside of London times, is that during that time, that was the active time for Australia hence I suspected that there is enough trade to maintain a trend. I'm also in the [live] CHF/JPY but in the opposite direction, (currently at -66pips)I have a BUY on the pair as there is a very strong resistance at 8570. (entered the trade not using this strategy). It was set overnight as a stop order that got triggered. Be careful of 8570. Yes your comments are very helpful, I'm still learning and yet to get to the point where I am consistent week in/week out with +pips profit by end of week. So far, like most noob forex traders i have more weeks ending with -pips than +pips, but I just need discipline and an effective strategy to keep the +pips constant. Good Luck Delta

Well done on both of those trades, congratulations In regards to me LONG on chf/jpy, I had read this article http://www.dailyfx.com/story/trading...816684913.html I normally don't trust trade signals or reviews like these, but I believed that one, and did my own analysis and the review made sense so i entered a stop order to go long. In hinesight, I can see what i should have done: After being stopped out the AUD/USD with a loss, I should have researched what news release had caused this at the time the stop loss was hit. Then I would have made a judgement on the impact of this news release on the currencies as a whole (I'm not very good at judging how much the news impacts what currencies). But obviously this news release has had such a big impact on the asian/australasian currencies that I should have cancelled the stop order on the CHF/JPY. I guess for next time, If I get stopped (when I shouldnt have) due to a sudden release. 1. Find out why? Fundamental? News Release? 2. Study the impact this would have on the currencies 3. If there is an impact on orders to open currencies. 4. Delete Any orders that may be affected by the news release. I guess that is the key to using Fundamental &amp; Technical Analysis. This has been a very expensive week for me.

Hi Al This meets the strategy's valid signals but the candle is way too big, is it best to keep out of this one? Or wait for a pull back to about 50% of the candle then re-enter?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
sir, pls send me the details on vasu.iworld@gmail.com regards, vasudevan

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Delta, Sorry taken so long to get back to you on this post. From your picture it looks like the large bar was not the signal bar - it would be the down candle in your picture. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Yes you were correct but this pair did not develop. I have now entered another one that met the rules of the strategy at EUR/AUD, I hope this is successful.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
If you are still in this trade I would bring your sl to 18300 unless you are at b/e already.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Delta, eur/aud has some resistancee at 18363. Might be good to bank some pips. DMI and MACD weakening also

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hey what do I know. Looks like you will be bagging a few extra pips Delta!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hey Al I've set the Stop Loss to the Parabolic SAR at the 30min set at 0.005, 0.008, 0.2 (on the quick chart IGIndex) and I am moving the stop loss up every 30 mins. I have set a few parameters that will get me out of the trade 1. I have set a trend line on the ADX if it breaks it, 2. RSI (if it falls below 50) 3. If the Trix Crosses Entry at 18321.4 My Limit is set for 19000 and Stop loss is at 18283 Also set the Trailing to move at Distance:112.2, Step:10pip (Shown on the chart as green thumbs) And thanks for your support Regards Tareq

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Delta, I don't think over the long run that the SAR will provide good exit points. The problem with any indicator and this includes MACD and DMI is that they lag. It is normally good to use them to get in but getting out you need something twice as dynamic. Saying that I still like using th MACD histogram as this show the convergence of 2 emas. I still think the best way is to plot s/r (including use of trenlines) reversal points because price action is the quickest indicator. Also use pivot points. I hope that you bagged a few pips from the eur/aud trade.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Still in the trade!!! at +40 pips The Parabolic SAR is there only to keep you in the trade for as long as possible and is there just to protect you from any sudden movements in the markets or sudden sentiment change, it's like an insurance blanket. From analysing trends, they either suddenly change and reverse, or they run out of steam. With the trends that run out of steam the Para SAR is your friend as it stays with you till the trend goes flat, but with sudden sentiment change, not so much but it does protect you from sudden drops but at the same time iron out any minor retracements to the overall trend. From looking at trends, most trends actually run out of steam, in regards to maximising the profit margin for sudden changes then you need a leading indicator, there is not that many about and reading them is not that easy as some of them are inauspicous. One that I have found easy to read is the Trix, as soon as the Fast trix changes to red then it may be a sign to get out. I have set the TP point to 161.8% Fib retracement of high-low of last down trend. which is calculated at 18732.1 (see attached) Another way is reading divergences in the RSI, this is a good article http://www.guppytraders.com/gup342.shtml as with these signals it can get you out of trouble before it happens.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Out of trade at -5.6pips. Maybe I should have listened to you. I'll watch this trade and see where it goes. ((kicking myself in the shins))

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Ok - we will agree to disagree on the SAR ! I have never provided an exit strategy as aprt of this thread - only suggestions of what I use. At the end of the day each trader is different. What we do have howeve ris a great way to enter trades. This in itself should be enough (whatever peoples exit strategies are) to mkae profit.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Definately is a great way to get in to a trade, and maybe I was being over-zealous with attempting alternative exit strategies with the use of SAR's and other indicators. I think these are fine if you are in a multi-lot trade where you can close part of the trade at s/r and let the other half run or get stopped by a trailing SAR stop. I'll learn to be more conservative with the 1 lot trades that I have. _______________________________________________ **One day, I'll get there, just hoping it's tomorrow**

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I have looked over last 4-5 years on ways to exit a trade. S/R is one if the best.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
ok thanks.. I'll stick to your rules like glue tomorrow!!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi Delta, No probs. It's a shame that you did not get anything from the last trade - but hey sometimes this is how they go. Look for s/r for exits or slowing down in macd/dmi in the future. When you enter a trade let me know and I will try and offer some asistance.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Good night and much appreciated. I'll be up by the crack of dawn hunting for a new entry. Food for thought: Chart below. I'm still convinced that there is room for refinement on the exit strategy, but that will have to be trialled out on a few runs on a demo account before I try it out on a live one. I have attached a screenshot on the last trade of the EURAUD and I narrowed it down to the 15min chart and we see a divergence from the Trix to the price where the trix has made lower highs but the price has made higher highs, which is a strong indication of a reversal. I'll try and pick up on that on the next trade, but I'll only experiment with this strategy on a demo account, will of course keep you updated on its progress and a comparison between this and the live trade and I'll probably test it on 10 trades compare avg pip difference between these two techniques

--- 帖子 #191 ---
There are loads of trades ready for setup according to this strategy. I have chosen CHF/JPY, as I seem to like this pair as they have strong long trends. Entered at 8616.9 stop at 8644.7 strong resistance at 8605. if 1h candle opens below that then 85.55 i've set tp at that

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Good work Delta. It was a case this morning of take your pick. chf/jpy has moved well - along with soem other pairs. It would have been very difficult to have not made pips.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I made 61.9 pips on that. it went even lower than my tp and it look like it might still go lower further. I have left my demo trade open

--- 帖子 #194 ---
You had a good and realistic TP level to start with so many congrats. The next level is prob around 84.00 ish so it is good to ocme out of this one and wait for the next that takes us down to that level. Using s/r is a very good way of TP. It is pure market dynamics that cause s/r levels. Most of the time price bounces a few time off these areas before it goes through. Why wait to get on a monster - just take the profit and wait for the next set up. Well done again.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
On a slightly different topic than this strategy, I am looking at a channel breakout on GBPJPY attachement shown.. with their take profit levels.. I just wanted your opinion on what you think about this potential breakout trade?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Entered this trade here live. (a small pip gain) CADJPY Short 8182.3 Entry Sell Limit 8150 Stop 8203.3 I was thinking, is that stop a bit too tight, should I give the pair a bit more freedom, due to the volatility of this trend?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
This pair for me did not show the ADX above 20 - so this on my chart would be a no trade

--- 帖子 #198 ---
wierd.. on the signaling candle shows ADX: 20.54 on my chart.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Just one of those things I guess.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
closed the order with a small loss

--- 帖子 #201 ---
The signal was validated ADX rose from low of 14.57 to 19.97 -DI&gt;20 -DI&gt;+DI Entered Trade at: 0.5694 stop at .5717 TP at 0.56391

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Good spot! I have not had time yet to trade today. Missed out on some crackers!

--- 帖子 #203 ---
The demo trade for CHF/JPY is still open on the SAR strategy. 86.16 entry price now 84.908 Up 125 pips!!!! But as I mentioned before, to fully test the most effective techniques between the 2 exit strategies, I'll do 10 Live trades with the exit strategy that you recommend and the same 10 trades on the demo account using the SAR exit strategy. When entering a trade the initial stop will be set as you had suggested (high of signalling candle + spread) but from there on will follow the SAR. I'll be posting the comparative analysis and pip difference between all 10 trades and with all the parabolic settings for each pair.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Ok sounds good. The nzd/usd is getting there - not the most explosive move I have ever seen! Signals looked good though for the short

--- 帖子 #205 ---
nzd/usd is always a slow mover, same as eur/gbp

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi Delta, My exit strategy includes goign to b/e after 20-40 pips (dependent on pair) and taking profit based on MACD or s/r. Is this what you will be using for the live? I would suggest as this is a test to run both strategies on demo until you ge the hang of the exit strategies.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Delta, I have just checked the chf/jpy trade and you would still be in this one with the MACD histogram exit strategy

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Yes I am using your exit strategies exactly as you had mentioned on the live account for 10 trades whilst testing the other method on demo. The exit I am using is set to: (on live) 1. Stop Loss to High+Spread of signal Candle 2. TP to 1st s/r 3. When +40pip, set to B/E 4. Move SL to High of Candle with a receding MACD Histo. Delta

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I closed on the demo, as the exit strategy is if any one of the 3 methods show a signal.. you get out. 3 signals are: 1. Fast trix turns Green 2. ADX breaks trend line 3. RSI breaks trend line The CHF/JPY signalled from exit number 1. But then it signalled the other 2 as well but I had exited the trade by then. The Fast trix is a leading indicator and can get you out of sharp reversal trends.. This trend just ran out of steam. details below: 1: 17/4/08 S.CHF/JPY SAR (30min 0.15, 0.07, 0.08) Enter: 8616.9 +61.9 Live: Exit 1st TP: 8555 +61.9 +118.4 Demo: Exit Fast Trix Green: 8498.5

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Just looking at the price action you can see that it has stalled.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Delta, Can you post the trix indi. I will have a look at it over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I closed the NZD/USD on Live, and closed half on demo In accordance to the systematic comparison, I'll consider this one closed on the demo too as it crossed the RSI trend line. I have also uploaded the indicators requested. THV3 Trix v4.01 is the one I use THV3 Trix for MTFHisto is version 5 (beta) customised and THV RSI which is the flashy RSI indicator with nice colours. original Files can be downloaded from here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=127271 Template can be found at: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...27271&amp;page=642

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Delta, I have breifly looked at the Trix and I am yet to be convinced that it will be as good as the MACD histogram. However we shall see. How did you end up on the week - up or down?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I ended the week with -pip. on live and +pip on demo. I've been trading forex now for about 3 years on and off, and really didnt follow a system, didn't and couldn't find a system that I liked or was confident in, but this one seems great. Thanks Al. I'll work on being a stickler to these rules, and I hopefully next week bring my account's arrears back to +ve with next week's gains. Had a great week the week before, but seem to have lost it all and more this week. Just need to be consistent, but I guess that's the same with all noobs (I still consider myself a noob), till I can consistently make a profit. Have a great weekend. Delta

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Have a good weekend too. Look at the charts over the weekend and look where you could have made better exits using s/r and the indicators. That eur/aud hit you pretty hard - there is no reason why you should not have taken away at least 50 pips from that one. This system is very reliable and it is case of defending your position as soon as it is possible and then cream off the pips. Speak soon.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I have been thinking of another way of maximising the profits on a longer term trend. Let's say we get a signal on a currency, and we enter as a trend is happening on the 1h hour chart. We are in the trade and the trade is going well, we then look at the 2hour chart and we notice that we are also within the confines of a valid trade adx&gt;20 +di&gt;-di and +di&gt;20 for long. and macd is valid too for the 2h. My question is: As we are in the trade on the 1h could we use this to scale our trade to the 2h and as long as we set our stops at minimum of break-even but this gives us the potential for trends that carry through on the 2h scale, we could carry this through to 4h, and 1 day and scale our trades accordingly. And I guess to determine the exit, we can also scale down in the opposite direction if we notice a reverse in price action we can then have a look from 1d to 4h if price is shifting and look down in further detail. This is an idea and i'm only thinking out of the box and I don't know if this would actually work in practice. After I conclude the current test I am doing with the possible SAR and 3 different signals on exit for maximising profits, I might have a look at this one later. I have also decided that 10 trades is a bit short sighted in regards to the effectiveness of the SAR/3 Exit strategy and will trial this out till the end of this week (with a minimum of 10 trades) and post the outcome here to see what the result difference is.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
hi to maximise the returns for any trade you are looking for whats not possible only the big few who control the whole thing can tell you that the market manipulators: but for us mere mortals try using bollinger bands and the williams ind its like rsi but faster it depends on your time frame but basically using candles in an uptrend away from the lower band when a candle spike touchesor goes near a band and as it does the williams reverses then get out it wont work for anything over an hourly chart cos you have to sit there and watch it looking for that sudden spike but for skimmers its ideal especially when the bollinger is in a channel and your just running side to side but you should never trade against the longer term trend i.e if youir using 5min charts and the hourly says up wait for the bounceoff alower band with the williams or rsi in same direction as the bounce and in till williams bounces off a resistance and out simple skimming parabolic sars are good for bounces as well especially when they are inside the bolliger band you have to look at the overall picture of a chart whats in the way of the next target will it get past thats where the williams comes in it weakens out for now dont see the profit go

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hello Al and all, I have backtested your system in the weekend a little bit and I was happy with the result obtained. I noticed that you place your sl at the entry candle high/low. Have you ever considered placing the sl at the previous swing high/low instead? Ramon

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi Volvo, Thanks for your input. Using s/r is the most effectie way of coming out of a trade. Exit half at the first s/r and then bring the remainder to b/e. Price 9 times out of ten bounce of s/r so it is my opinion that gettign out at these points are best.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Oblo, This point was raised by Deltaworld at the beginning of the thread. I use the high/low of the indicating candle - this is just personal preference and the SL should be down to the individual.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Good Morning and welcome to a new week. I wish the best pips for everyone. I received a valid signal entry for AUD/USD. I have entered the trade live at 7094.1 S I missed a trade this morning about an hour ago at the GBP/JPY(s) I was trying to scalp a few pips from entry point, but it just carried on going down.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
As per the rules I entered this trade and out for few pips because of the two long preceding candles and worried of retracement.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi guys, Looks like a good trade to get into but be aware of large two candles proceeding with no retracement. Also there is strong support at 7075 to 7050 - (4h chart) so be careful.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi guys, I am currently in this eur/chf trade. Target 15147.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Delta, Looks like you made the right choice on which pair to go with. Mine is getting there slowly. If I was you I would be getting to b/e now or closing out 1/2 of your position and bring rest to b/e. There could be a temp retracement as price has moved a fair way.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I've been looking at a way of strategizing a technique for setting the breakeven dependant on the volatility of the pair, as each pair reacts differently. With the indicator attached, this calculates the ATR (Average Trading Range) and x 3 then it gives you a figure of recommended Stop Loss. From looking at past trades and with high volitility pairs e.g. eur/jpy and gbp/jpy they may need to have a higher b/e trading range. =(ATR*3)/Factor gives you the recommended B/E point. Where Factor is 2.948113208 e.g. for AUD/USD Indicator shows 75 for ATR*3 75/Factor = 25.5 pip till B/E A few more examples EURJPY 125/Factor= 42.4 pip till B/E NZDUSD 66/Factor= 22.4 pip till B/E GBP/JPY 171/Factor= 58 pip till B/E USD/JPY 75/Factor= 25.2 pip till B/E Now the reasoning behind dividing by this factor is that from looking at previous trades (especially the more volatile ones) setting at 40 pips b/e might occasionally get you stopped out at B/e when the trend continues down again on a minor retracement due to volatility of the pair. But, if you want to be extra conservative and stick to the original 20-40 b/e pip rule, then a minimum and maximum can be set. e.g. A minimum b/e even pip point will never be less than 20 and maximum b/e pip is 40. I hope this is helpful. This would then make the b/e rule easier to program if needed for automation through an EA. This will then be scalable to any timeframe and any currency. This will also scale to the current conditions affected by the average trading range e.g. news/other currency movmenents/stock movements/etc etc. p.s. I received another valid signal for EUR/JPY which was entered at 12770 for a target of 12700 AUD/USD was closed for a +30pip

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi Delta, I am in the ej trade too now. Not doing very well... So, how much have set your sl for this trade according to that indicator? It shows 131 pips to me. Is it right? Thanks, Ramon

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi Ramon no, it's not doing very well, but it looks like it is on its way back down again from analysing the 1m and 5m charts. Hopefully it has had its retracement and carry on with the trend south. I have set the SL at 824.4

--- 帖子 #229 ---
There seems to be a divergence with the low lows and the NO divergence with the High Highs.. as seen here with the Trix levels. This is not a good sign as divergences are not good. on trix for with trend patterns.. i'm still 50/50 about the direction of this pair, need further consolidation for the down trend to account for this being a safe trade.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
It looks like eur/jpy has consolidated and is non-trend ranging between 38.2 and 0.00 fib levels as seen here with the bollinger bands narrowed to a horizontal channel.. Till we get a breakout of this channel, I can't say which direction it is yet to go.. My stop is 1 pip above the 50.00 retracement (next resistance line) but if it breaks south, there will be a big move on this pair.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
The good news is.. that the EUR/JPY opened a candle below the support of the BB and it opened a candle below the 0.0 fib LEVel.. 2 Indications that that has broken the consolidation and has continued its development south.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I am already out of EJ. I am still not confident with the sl. As per rules the sl for this trade was around 60 pips. And is difficult to go and get a RR 1:1 in this case. So, I preferred to exit at half atr14. How have you done guys?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I have ended up even for the day so far. The good news was that 12 pairs showed signals during today. Even good more news was that 10 made healthy profits - either now closed or still live. The bad news is 2 pairs have failed yet to make a profit - both of which were traded by myself and others on the thread. eur.chf - was a loser eur/jpy - I broke even after price had bounced around a little It just seems to the case of choosing the wrong pair - my account does nto let me trade more that 3-4 pairs.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I'm still in the eur/jpy at the moment. I've also just calculated the R:R for the trade im in which is at 1:1.29 SL at 54 pips TP at 70 pips. The move is still on a down trend but moving slowly, so I don't see a need to exit the trade as of yet. The pair is making lower lows and is still in within its ranging trading channel as shown. Also the USD/JPY is expected to reach a very strong resistance level of 98.00 which will dynamically affect this currency, If USD/JPY reaches 98 before EJ reaches my 1st TP level, then I'll be exiting the trade. The rate of progression for this channel is about -7.27 pips per hour. Edit 1: According to my calculations, this trade should reach B/E point within the hour. Edit 2: Now set to BE

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I got a lil loss on E/C too. Have you re-entered short later after the retracement? Good job delta. You were right on E/J, still going down. Ramon

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Live Trade: +70.1 pip trade at 1st Profit level Demo Trade: Left Open (Testing alt. exit strat.) Thank you Ramon, for the end of this candle hour, i'll be looking for more potential pairs, will post here which ones I am looking at. No, I didn't re-enter short again, as I didnt exit the e/j on the retracement. My account size unfortunately can't open 2 simultaneous trades, so I was just in the one trade. and another short was not opened. But yes, that seems like a valid strategy if you have the funds within the correct money management techniques to use as with that technique you are averaging your R:R to better odds.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
A potential setup is LONG USD/CHF. According to the rules this pair is not valid yet, but over the next 1-2H this could develop into a valid signal, where the ADX is &gt;20 and the ADX has risen since its last candle +DI is still at 18 and rising.. MACD is not confirming the signal.. One to watch. Wait of the close of current candle or next candle.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi oblo, No I did not get back in on eur/chf as I saw the signal late. Wish I had as this would have wiped out my earlier loss on this pair.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I can't seem to find any valid signals appearing or are yet to happen. There are a few signals that have happened, which you could enter late, but that just increases the chances of a reversal or retracement putting you in -pipland. So as the best traders do, its best to wait for a good setup than go in hastely.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Don't worry Delta there will be some signals coming along soon. Sounds like you had a good start to the week!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Yes, this week has got a promising start. I finished at -196 pips last week, so I am really hoping for a good pip week. +100.1 for the week and it's only Monday!!!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
For those of you without your own, attached are a couple of scripts to help get in quickly. You can set your stopstp's as either pips or price.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Steve, What do these scripts allow you to do?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I think these are metatrader scripts that for setting the Stop Loss and Take Profit, instead of typing in the price of where you want the TP/SL to be you can type them in as pip value or as a currency value, which I am guessing would be useful for money management techniques. I have tried installing them, but I can't seem to get them to work. I placed them in C rogram Files (x86)MetaTrader 4expertsscripts and restarted MT4 then went to place an order and I didnt get any extra boxes or dialog boxes showing the price/pip entry for SL/TP.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Oops. Sorry. Like all coders, I expect you to read my mind. They place either a long or a short trade for you. Drag them onto the chart you want to trade, alter the lot size and enter sl and tp as appropriate.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Here are some useful indicators. Fxsnipers adx - Adx line changes colour to indicate slope. Adx bars - colours your bars when adx and dminus dplus above 20. Adx signal - gives alert when di/dp crosses adx (its useful although entry using this ac's method usually comes in 1 hour before).

The potential LONG USD/CHF never formed and now it looks like at the end of this hour a short USD/CHF is forming. Watch this pair as it looks like the long LONG trend, seem to now have decided to reverse.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
This pair never did decide to go short after all. Still flat as an Ikea Flat-Pak I was just about to go into GBP/JPY LONG.. as a signal had formed, but I remembered one of the things that you had said AC about if there is a divergence with the dominant DI then it is best to stay out of the trade. So I did stay out the trade and a good thing that was. If I had gone into the trade and placing the stop at the signal candle, would have got me stopped out within 10 minutes. Any pairs forming on the Horizon? or is anyone in a trade at the moment? AUD/NZD.. Looks like a winner, I'll probably enter this on the hour

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Got a -16 pips on uc this morning on opening Eurozone market + news release. The market was consolidating and I entered on a valid signal.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi oblo. I got stung a couple of times by news releases. Sometimes they can go in your favour and other times they just stop you out. I'm in AUD/NZD at the moment but this pair has got a very high spread of 20. Although the pair is at about the same point as entry i'm -21 pips already. entered at 12600.5

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I was analysing the yesterday losses. The e/c pair made a retracement and I exited too early. Looking to the rsi trend line I would have stayed in up to the final consolidation at 1.51 level. Not bad...

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I had a look at eurchf too and I could see that the were was a valid entry point (shown as purple line for signal) then the reentry will happen on open of next candle (shown as red arrow). This would have netted you a -24.1 pip loss (inclusive of spread). Waited for retracement to complete and another signal to re-occur and enter on open of candle after signal (as shown). The TP level would be set at either of RSI trend line breaking (as you have shown) OR. at Strong Support (shown in yellow) from previous trend lows.. and this was also a larger time frame key fib level of 0.5 TP at that level would have netted you +49 pip (inclusive of spread) A total balance of trading that pair for the day would have given you a +24.9 pip win.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I have not had any vaild signals so far today. Not sure on u/c - this shows as a no trade on my system - could be again down to the feed. Not surprising little going on after yesterdays moves.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I closed the AUDNZD, didn't feel safe with the trade as it was touching a longer term trend support line (shown on graph). I made a small profit of +4pips.

Pips are pips. Price had come down to yesterday support also.

Hi guys, After yesterdays big moves I would be selective in which trades you take as there is likely to be some retracement. Sometimes retracements after big moves causes the system to give signals - as they are defining a trend agianst the overall trend. It would be prudent if any trades are taken that they are watched closely and profits locked in at every opportunity.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Some set up are creating on different pairs. All of these uj, eu, ej are countertrend signal with shooting star. Maybe a sign to stay out.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I am in on e/u and have kept my stop tight at 25 pips below open of indicating candle - thisis due to it being a down cnadle with very little wick. It is also at the low of the candle previous to the indicating one. I think it will come back and test high of previous bar where I will be potnetially taking profit. Sometimes these trade offer low capital risk and high reward - as the stop can be placed tightly. We will see.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
There is very little directionality in the market today, the market not sure which way to go. So, as this strategy is called "Directional Movement" I'll probably stay out until I see a trend in at least one of the pairs. There is a strategy somewhere here on FF about correlation with pairs and when you spot a trend with one pair, is an early sign of a trend on another pair. Again, look out for a developing trend on any pair, even if you miss out on that one, its an early bird indication of a trend yet to come. IMHO: I think the trend is bearish on majors GU EU EJ but the market is just having a breather before further drops come along. It's also best to trade on the 1H with the direction of the longer term trend in progress or developing, rather than against it as this then increases your % wins.

Hi AC I have a question in regards to the rules of the strategy. Say you have entered a trade as was indicated by the signal candle and you have set your SL and your TP to 1st s/r. (as shown on diagram). But then the PA has decided to reverse on the direction that you were taking and it looks like it is to hit the SL that was set. We can see on the chart that the Histogram is narrowing, and is showing signs of reversal. And the +DI, and -DI are also showing signs of reversal. As you had mentioned before that when the trade is in profit and the histograms start receding then set the SL to the H/L of that candle, to lock in profits on a tighter stop. But in this case we are still at -pip and there is no room to lock in profits but we are seeing the histo start to recede. Another situation is: we are not in profit on the trade and the PA is between entry and SL and at least one of the following has occurred. 1. Histo has reversed 2. MACD has reversed 3. DI has reversed. A Do you then exit the trade at a smaller loss than if the PA had hit SL OR B Let the price continue, allowing it to maneuver between Entry and SL to then continue towards it's initial trend direction from the signal provided? and keeping the SL there to minimise any further losses. Thanks in advance Tareq

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi Tareq, Good questions. My own style would be very similar to answer A. Take a smaller loss as the sl is now reduced. But sometimes dependent on how small /bigthe loss would be I would keep the original stop loss. If say the sl was moved to take a smaller loss but it was onyl say 5-10 pips away from the original I would keep the original one in place. If the move of the SL saved me +30 pips (of potnetial loss) I would ignore the first SL and move it accordingly. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
So the stop loss would be moved tighter and the position not closed when the histo/macd reversed and/or +di/-di reversed? when in negative territory. p.s. forgot to upload chart from last post.. chart added now.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
If all or one of the indcators started to go against me I would move my stop loss to the low of this candle. If by moving the stop loss it only moved the stop loss by 10 pips I would keep the SL in the orignal place. If the move was greater than 10 pips I would then move the sl to the low of the canlde that showed a potential reversal. The histogram shows a narrowing of the emas well before the DMI. However by placing a stop above this candle it is pretty much around the same level as the original stop loss. I would hterfroe not move the SL.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Delta, I have added my interpretation of your chart. As attached. There are a couple of things you can do. However bottom line the trade got to +42 pips - you should be at least at break even after making this amount or taking part profit at the first support level.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
AudCHF is forming nicely.. Looks like it has just come out of its retracement.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi Delta, i do not have this pair on my charts. Let me know how it goes.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Thanks for the chart interpretation, thats a great help. Thanks. I have now entered the aud/chf short at 8168.6

--- 帖子 #270 ---
An update of the chart with the entry, SL and TP levels TP is at Green thumb. 8119.3

--- 帖子 #271 ---
That was the quickest -19.9 pips i ever lost. It suddenly reversed on me so fast and hit the stop loss, that I didnt have time to analyse whether I should have reduced the SL. so far I am -16.9 pips for the day

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi Delta, It looks like the DMI&gt;20 and ADX had turned around before the MACD was correct

--- 帖子 #273 ---
A lot of false signals today. These have been countertrend or in the consolidation area. Delta, on my Alpari chart the trade on aud/chf was not validated by the macd. Yesterday is already far...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
What do you mean by that? The signal i got as shown by the brown vertical bar is -DMI&gt;20 ADX&gt;20 ADX rose from last bar MACD confirming Short I entered long Dragon 14357.4

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Delta, The bar previous to the one indicated by the brown line showed the adx increasing. It might have been the one before but I can not see that from the chart. If the MACD does not confirm at the same time as the ADX turns (over 20 or 3 off bottom) with DMI&gt;20 then you should leave the trade alone completely. It looks like the trade was confirme dby MACD a candle after the original signal from the DMI/ADX.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yes you are right but the one preceding the brown line was not a valid signal as the MACD was not confirming the trade.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes there have been a few false signals. MACD has worked well however in stopping the false signals from DMI.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi delta, Hope I was clear in my description. Just going forward. 1. A trade can be taken late (with caution) if the signal candle had all indicators confirming at the same time. 2. A trade is not to be taken when the correctly positioned DMI/ADX is waiting for the MACD to confirm. If the MACD does not confirm at the same time wait for the next signal given by DMI/ADX. gbp/jpy is a great one to be on currently.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi AC Thanks for the rules clarification, I have a better understanding of that, and in hinesight, that would have kept me out of that previously losing trade. I went into gbp/jpy and exited with 41.7 profit, as one of you money management techniques discussed previously on this thread that if you are down for the day you may bank at 40 pip, which I did so. I have left the demo account for the pair running. You will see that the market suddenly moved and alot of the pairs have trended with large moves. The JPY currency has weakened. So when exited the trade I wanted to get back in on the jpy rally so, I researched trying to find the strongest currency that I can pitch against the JPY. The best pair I could see a further move is the AUDJPY which I have since entered at 7003

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Good move on exiting gbp/jpy - it had moved a good distance. all ways a smart idea to get to break even for the day. Try the exit method we discussed yesterday on the demo account.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
cad/jpy trade that I am currently in. PA now at some support so thinking about locking in some profit.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi AC If at 0700 GMT, you notice that the signals for the system were all generated pre 0700 GMT and getting in at 0700 would be getting into the signal late, do you still go in or do you wait for another fresh signal start? In any trades this morning?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hi Delta, Good question. Yes I tend to go in on a trade at 7 a.m if the indicators are correct. I am currently in eur/usd.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I got a signal for g/u as noted by the brown line.. Entered at 0800gmt and the euro news had impacted in a weaker dollar. This got me stopped out with a -42pips It looks like you are on the right side of the news for e/u, congrats!! On the same topic as the question this morning, I am looking at the e.u trade and the signal candle finished at 0600 GMT, does that mean at 0700, you go in one signal late?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
There was a signal on e/u at 0600 GMT - I entered on the close of this candle (i.e. start of 0700 GMT) Sometimes I start the day a little later - I just then wait for the signals from there. I would be cautious of joining a trade that had already moved a good distance. i.e. if at 0700 GMT the e/u had already moved 300 pips in the early hours even if the indis remained good I would be a little wary. I always try to get in on the trade at earliest possible stage as from this point b/e can happen a lot quicker. On the g/u there was divergence on the -DMI. - DMI was not getting greater whilst price was making new lows.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Good Morning &amp; Good week I have just entered long USD/CHF. it looks like a good setup.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Anyone else take this trade...my entry was timed using my M1 and M2 systems. I always watch this pair. Hung with trade most of day while at work....as long as price stayed below 8MA. Closed just above 126, although I should still be in the trade as price still below the 8MA. Exit strategy was to stay in the trade as long as price did not close above the 8MA for two consecutive candles. The best entry was on the first or second candle of the day...but it's hard for me to enter a trade that early in the week. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Well done on a good spot on that trade, no I missed the whole euro thing today. I just stuck with one trade the usd/chf. I banked a few pips just before the big candle on usd/chf. Should have been patient.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Stop move to BE.....and looking for a big move down. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #290 ---
It Looks like the Euro/USD has been oversold over the last few days and has now consolidated over a key support level of 1.3 with a potential of a rebound over the next few hours. Also looking at the USD/CAD. There is potential move to the upside, weakening the loonie. From looking at those 2 charts and that the signal was generated for Eur/CAD, long, but for how long, I don't know I guess look out for any point of reversal on any of the 2 charts above. Happy Trading and good luck Edit: I was looking through my past RSS feeds and I found this article, which aids my hypothesis on the long move of eur/cad http://www.dailyfx.com/story/trading...872281850.html

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hi acartwright....i entered a long in euro at 1.3077 as +dmi (up from 19.7 to 24) is greater than -dmi &amp; adx rose from prev 28 to 28.3...watching stop 1 pip below low at 1.3048. is this entry correct? tks

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Sholmes At the brown line indicated is the signal, normally you would place the stop at the low of the signal candle +/- spread The low of the signal candle on my chart says 1.30477 but looking at that candle it does not have a wick and entry is so close to stop that it doesn't give the pair to breathe. So taking the previous candle's wick low at 1.30355 and I have a 2pip spread on my a/c so I would set the stop to 1.30335 As soon as you are +31.6 pips then set it to b/e (This is my personal opinion, I may be wrong.) I hope this helps

--- 帖子 #293 ---
tks very much deltaworld! appreciate you responded so soon, it doesnt matter if it's right or wrong. i was a little concerned abt my entry as i'm still new to this system &amp; not sure i have entered correctly. what you said about stops is quite true, will adjust it according. thanks heaps!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
hi acartwright and deltaworld, what's your common strategy for tp? do you look at sup &amp; res levels to decide? cos in current euro trade, i've moved sl to b/e initially but as price went higher, have trailed stop to 1.3107 just in case it retraces. also tempted to get out here cos want to enjoy the champs league game in abt an hour's time without any position. can advise? tks.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
yes s/r is a good place to get out of trade at the moment €/$ is at resistance of 13135 which it reached and is now consolidating at that point.. Or you can trail stop loss and leave it running. I had a position with nzd/usd last week that was on an uptrend but it was getting late and I needed to go to bed it was already on b/e so I just set it on trailing stop and in the morning I had closed the position with a +62 pip gain. if you have time to monitor it, a FF trader on this thread had a great exit strategy, so simple on the MA at 8 candles and if it closes twice consecutively below then you get out, but whatever you feel is appropriate.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
tks deltaworld! tks very much for your help. you mentioned abt MA at 8 candles, do you know where i can find the thread....would like to learn more abt it. tks.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi SHolmes. The exit strategy relating to 8MA is the one attached here from CanuckCT, which he demonstrated on eur/jpy (chart shown). This I have quickly back tested this on a few trends and when you have long trends it can keep you in them to the very end, but when there are quick reversal you may be caught out, especially on news releases or big sudden changes in market sentiment.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi guys, My interpretation of eur/usd. In 13076 and SL 13045. Also in answer to Holmes post - be careful you do not get mixed up between ADX and DMI. It is the ADX that needs to rise 3 off bottom and not necessarily the DMI. Delta - you may have got confused as you seem to mention the down candle as the one you get in on as you mention the entry is close to the stop. Al

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Exactly Delta....the use of the 8SMA is when you catch a trade that starts to trend. It's one way to keep you in a trade that really starts to move in your favor. The way I use it is if there are 2 consecutive candles that close on the other side of the 8SMA, you close the trade. So basically you check it every couple of hours when price is near the moving average.. The other thing I look at is significant points of support and resistance using H4 and up and the hourly MACD cross. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #300 ---
tks once again for your help deltaworld! really appreciate for posting attachment. and hi to acartwright &amp; tks for replying too. noted on the dmi &amp; adx. one quick question, if adx is falling say from 35 to 30 &amp; during this time a dmi crossover happens (with crossover dmi value &gt;20), thereafter adx rebounds from 30 to 30.1....we can still take trade even though the adx are of fairly high value &amp; the jump is a small 0.1, yes? tks sorry if question sounds illogical but really like your system &amp; still new with it.

Hi, I was silent follwer of your thread. my first post. The system is very profitable if caught at first available signal. Is there any alert signal available for this system. Thanks in advance. Harry

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi Holmes, I would sya yes you can still take the trade in this instance. When this happens be careful however and look for any s/r that could hinder the trade. Note - ADX moving from 30 upwards has less room to move than say ADX rising from 20. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi Harry, I do not have an alert system as such but I have added soemthing that might help. It shows a green bar when ADX is rising - you will have to manually calculate 3 off the bottom however. You can use it to eyeball potentials before the hour ends. Al

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thanks from the core of my heart. Can you explain what do u mean by 3 off the bottom.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Are we going towards valid buy signal Thanks Harry

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Balle, 3 off the bottom means that you can take a trade when ADX is not over 20 as long as it has increased by 3. I.E. ADX 12.4 to 14.6 to 15.6 would be a valid signal on ADX.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
tks acartwright for your reply.... watching euro 1 hr &amp; there's a crossover of dmi with -dmi abt 31 vs +dmi 16. and adx has also started to rise from 29 to 30 after falling from highs of 40. macd line also below signal line. adx not so ideal as it is still quite high but think probably will take this trade again at the close of bar.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
as at end of bar, adx just improved from 29.75 to 29.95....very small increase. entry was 1.3287 but stop was just 1.3294 (hi was 1.3293). entered trade &amp; thinking of moving stop higher to prev bar's high of 1.3322.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Sholmes, Looks like a a good trade well taken. The good thing about the adx in this instance is that it has made a nice round bottom. Also MACD is moving well away from it's signal line. These trades can be high reward to low risk due to the nature of the signal candle. This one was a hammer but it had made a lower low and a lower high so no reason not to take it. It would be wary of any s/r however.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hi acartwright....tks once again for your new tip: round bottom adx. you mentioned abt hammer that had a lower lo, lower hi....in this instance, it's most likely not a valid reversal hammer? was concerned too but seeing momentum skewed more to the downside, so just followed your system &amp; took the trade. and a very big thank you for your help! very lucky indeed to find your system in this forum. been using dmi for a while but didnt have consistent results as the way you're using it. you have been trading like this for 4-5 yrs? just out of curiosity....

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi shomes, I have been working on strategies based on the dmi/adx for over 4 years now and I beleive that using it with the MACD gives the best results.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
got it....thanks once again.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Are we going towards buy at the candle end. Thanks

--- 帖子 #315 ---
1 hr euro chart, -dmi&gt;+dmi....-21.9 vs +10.6, dmi also went from prev 29.9 to current 30.5 (after decling from high of 43), macd also below signal line. entry 1.3289 stop 1.3314 (hi was 1.3313). again dmi still at fairly high value. trade entered, watching stop now.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Just entred long on usd chf. My first trade according to this system. Let us see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
hi acartwright....in one trade 2 weeks earlier, used the entry bar low minus 1 pip as stop for a buy entry, +1.2959, stop 1.2920. however, was stopped out as price traded to a low exactly at stop level, 1.2920 &amp; then it reversed to trade higher. in your opinion, how do you re-enter long again? or do we just sit out altogether &amp; wait for next signal? tks.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
hi balle, tks for heads up. thinking abt entering that chf now too but have euro position....still deciding.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
have bot back 1 lot at 1.3259 &amp; moved stop loss for the other balance 1 lot to 1.3289 entry.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi Holmes, In answer to your question I would wait for another valid signal before I would enter again. Also in regard to stops it is always good to look at other s/r as potential stop points as long as they are int he vacinity of the low of the indicating candle.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Balle, That looks like a good entrance in hindsight. I would be looking for TP around 11423 area.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Good work.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
ok noted on that. tks once again.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
hi acartwright, just a general question. when looking for s&amp;r, what's the best time frame chart to look at? cos am still not confident in own s&amp;r levels. tks.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I tend to use 1 hour time frame. I simply zoom out so I can get a clearer picture of where the s/r points are likely to be. This is in conjunction with also using trendlines.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
tks....will give it a try.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
hi acartwright. just seeking your opinion in euro. on 1 hr euro, there is dmi crossover with macd line above signal line....just awaiting adx to increase from previous bar to signal entry. adx has declined from high of 44 to now abt 34 &amp; euro traded today to low of 1.3212 &amp; recovered to trade near 1.3400. from your experience, if adx does increase afterwards to say 35 (high value) ....would you be hesitant to enter trade? or look at entry bar to see what kind of range it has? tks &amp; sorry for the trouble. am not good with s&amp;r but from glance on 1 hr chart, do see several r at 1.3390/1.3430/1.3470.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi holmes, I am always careful when ADX turns from a high position - this is due to the ADX only having a certian amount of room to increase. In regard to the eur/usd it is currently at what I would call a resistance point at 13385. Also ADX has not turned round as yet.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
thanks acartwright. think if adx turns around in 1 hr euro, it shld still be somewhere in the 35 region. so that might be a deterrent to take trade.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
just fyi....on euro 1 hr bar, -dmi&gt;+dmi 23 vs 14.3, adx rose just modestly to 22.11 from 21.91 after declining from highs of 30s. entry short 1.3338 stop 1.3357 (1 pip above entry bar high). was stopped out within half an hour. maybe shld have placed stop higher near res level 1.3388-93? or maybe shldnt have entered cos euro ppi looming.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi holmes, It is hard to say whether or not to enter on this set up. There is support around the 13325 area - also the overall trend is up so it could have been a retracement of notable value that changed the indicators to show a sell signal. It is just one of those that loses unfortunately. Keep an eye out for a long set up on this pair.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
ok noted tks. yes was waiting for the long set up. unfortunately for personal 1 hr chart, dmi &amp; adx conditions met (+dmi&gt;-dmi, adx jumped above 20 as well) but macd line was still below signal at that point. so no long there. other charts with different price feeds might be showing macd line above signal?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
1 hr euro, dmi crossover....+dmi&gt;-dmi, 27.6 v 15.5. adx also increased but just modestly from 27.5 to 27.6 (after declining from 43). macd line also above signal. entry 1.3359 stop 1.3309. however, range of bar is almost 65 pips. so not taking trade yet. maybe if it retraces to 1.3335/40 level.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi holmes, I looked at this one but stayed out as price was coming to the 13375 area and noticed some resistance at thispoint..

--- 帖子 #335 ---
hi acartwright, stayed out too cos decided to rather wait for fresh signal instead.... what currencies do you trade too? tks....

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hello Acartwright, Thank you for sharing your trading strategy. I am currently looking at the GBPUSD chart and there seems to be a valid sell signal. Please confirm. This will allow me to see if I understand your strategy. Thank you. fxpilot

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi fxpilot, There did seem to be a signal generated on the GBPUSD. However the candle that gave the signal had a higher high and a higher low so I would be staying away from that one.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
hi acartwright, does a higher hi &amp; higher lo means buying momentum still strong? most of the time, with your method, it's buying in a rally for further strengthening &amp; selling in a sell-off for further exhaustion....is observation correct? tks....

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi holmes, This comment was in a response to the system showing a sell on GBPUSD. The indicating candle has a higher high and a higher low which would represent the start of a move long. As a result I would not have taken the sell signal the system produced.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
ok got it.... the 1 hr euro chart is developing a bullish crossover....do see some res at 1.3440/50 level. in your opinion, do you think can take long trade if dmi, adx &amp; macd signals confirmed long? tks.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi holmes, THe DMI signalled at 6.00 am GMT. However the MACD was not correct. I would therefore leave this pair alone until there is a new signal on the DMI and the MACD confirms.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
1 hr euro, just went short at 1.3590 with stop at 1.3607. adx rose to 28.5 from 27.9 &amp; macd below signal. but price action has gone really quiet....

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi holmes, This was a viald signal and you should not be in too much trouble with it. The only thing that I can add for futre is that you are now trading outside the London session. Euro and GBP pairs tend to lose their volatility after 5pm GMT. Most of the moves happen when the London session is alive. Also price has just moved thorugha round number. If I were you I would set your trade to b/e as there is support at 13575 ish.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
ok got it....tks. yes not much volatility as you said....got out b/e in the end. and looks like eur 1 hr signalling long soon.... +dmi&gt;-dmi, adx also increasing from prev bar, macd just above signal....

--- 帖子 #345 ---
went long euro at 1.3650 with stop at 1.3604 as conditions met. but seeing res at 1.3665/70 area. it tested there once but has retraced, tempted to just get out. what's your opinion acartwright? tks....

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi holmes, I think this trade has a chance if it gets beyond 13670. Next area to look at then would be 13735. There is quite strong resistance at its current level.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
tks for swift reply.... will keep watching stop &amp; see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi Cartwright! I was about to enter in u/chf. But I saw support at 1041. Decided to wait for next signal. Thanks

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Acartwright I have seen that your strategy also works very well on 1 m charts for getting small pips. What do you say about this. Thanks

--- 帖子 #350 ---
quite strong res here in euro.... hi acartwright, do you think shld move stop to b/e level? tks....

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I would move to b/e.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
ok....tks. stop at b/e now....

--- 帖子 #353 ---
broke 1.3650 &amp; got out there b/e....

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi holmes, Nevermind there are plenty more trades to come. If you had traded the system with g/u you would be up 35 pips. soemtimes it is aobut picking the wrong pair but if you get the break even that is still as good as a winner.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
tks for the encouraging words. been trading euro all this while....am exploring other currencies but would like to get more knowledge of your system first.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
hi acartwright, on macd, are there any specific things to take note of? like bullish crossover when below zero line &amp; bullish crossover when above zero line? is there any significance from your experience? say when macd crosses signal line up from below &amp; both are below zero line and quite far away from zero line, the trend tend to be stronger? as compared to a bullish crossover just below zero line? tks....

Hi holmes, There are no real specific things on the MACD that I can mention apart from the normal way to trade MACD. In this strategy it is only a confirming indicator. I would point out the following though: 1. MACD above signal line and above zero - strong upward potential 2. MACD above signal line and below zero - upward potential but could be a pull back - I normally check price action to see if it has strong upward potential or if it is going sideways. 3. MACD below signal line and below zero - strong downward potential 4. MACD below signal line and above zero - possible sideways or retracement. Look at PA to confirm. Hope that helps.

Hey there AC, Here is a situation where ADX and -DMI lined up, but MACD did not confirm until a bar later. The first vertical has ADX and -DMI but no MACD...the second vertical has all three. Is this a trade setup that you would pass on? I took 60 pips on this so it did work out nicely....but I'm thinking it's outside your rules as indicated on the thread. Cheers CanuckCT

Hi Balle, Sorry to tkae such a long time to repsond - I have only just seen your post. This strategy works on all time frames. The reaosn I use hourly is due to the spread I trade on. If you can get a big move on the 1m it is worth it but sometimes the moves can be 10-15 pips which means most of the profit is lost.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi Canuck, Well I cannot tell you off if you make a profit now can I . I try to trade when all 3 line up - this is just for being in a comfort zone. I can then tell myself if I have a loser that I traded on the best set up. If I go in late and do not stay with the strategy rules and lose it would be a case of well what if. I think the more you get used to the signals from the DMI you can go in one bar later if MACD then confirms or one bar earlier if the MACD is close to a cross. This is due to the DMI providing the more concrete signal. What I would try to do is probably get to break even slightly earlier in the move if I am taking the signal a bar late. As long as MACD is pointing in the correct direction I do not think it is too much of an issue - all the cross is is a cross past a 9 MA signal line. Obviuosly what you have done with this trade works out so congrats. Al

hi acartwright, just a general question. in trying to access whether price has any potential move upward/downward or going sideways, what can one look at (indicators?)? how do you normally access such situations? by looking at pure price action? tks....[/quote] Hi homes, Good question. The reason we trade a rise in the adx over 20 or 3 off its bottom is to make sure we are going with the overall direction. Normally if price is going sideways adx will be flat, under 20 or decreasing from a high level. ADX and DMI is based on directional movement from bar to bar. You can always draw a few trendlines through swing lows and highs also to get an overall picture.

Heres a trade I am currently in. ADX had just creepd over 20 but it had come from 17.5 so was happy to take it. Currently at b/e.

great job!

Hi guys, gbp/usd got out for 15 pips - turned around pretty quick and I was a bit slow. Did however have 40 pips of success with cad/jpy which I opened before going to the gym. I had put a limit order on the next bit of support I could find. When I got back it had made 42 pips. I have attached a screenshot.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
superb!

--- 帖子 #369 ---
hi acartwright, just need your opinion.... when trading gbp/usd, shld we also apply indicating bar hi/lo as stops? or shld one use swing hi/lo as stops? cos thot that gbp/usd is quite volatile &amp; better to use a bigger buffer for stops? tks....

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi holmes, You can put your stops where you feel comfortable. I place them at the high or low of the indicating candle. A trend is determined by lower lows and lower highs for short and vice versa for long. If you place your stop at the high or low in theory you should not be stopped out if you have entered on a trend. Hope that makes sense but it is really down to you.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
ok tks....

--- 帖子 #372 ---
hi acartwright....just a question. when there's dmi crossover, do we need to observe the 'extreme point rule'? tks....

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi holmes, The extreme point rule is kind of disregarded as 99% of the time with a rising adx the price goes past the extreme point of the dmi cross. Wilder introduced this for those persons just trading the dmi cross to cut down on whip saws. ADX was alter added. If you want to include it in this strategy please do so.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
ok....tks.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
anyone try this EA based on this strategy

--- 帖子 #376 ---
never....is it just based purely on dmi crossovers? tks....

--- 帖子 #377 ---
on eur 1 hr....bullish dmi crossover (+dmi 24, -dmi 12.5), adx went to 31.1 from 29.9 after falling from highs of 60. entry was 1.3496 with stop at 1.3462. trade hasnt developed over the last 40 mins or so....thinking of liquidating soon.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi holmes, Are you still in this trade? Entry at 1.3496 is only 4 away from a round number so you have to be careful. If you are still in you could be up.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
yes still in trade....but was tempted to get out cos of low volatility. however, when thinking abt it, price went down quickly but luckily just short of stop level 1.3462. squared off 1 lot at 1.3526 &amp; has moved bal 1 lot to 1.3526 stop. and now just entered another long (1 lot only this time as it is before ldn open and nearing res)....bullish dmi crossover, +dmi 21.6 v -dmi 12.1, however, adx just inched higher from 27.51 to 27.56 after declining from near 39. macd also above signal line....entry 1.3569 stop 1.3551.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
unfortunately got stopped out at 1.3551....

I have an indicator for this method...it's still a bit rough, but identifies most of the trades. I post it here so that someone may help to finish it. The indicator draws a line on the bar after the trade triggers and a price tag for the open of that bar. It has the rule per AC, except for the 3 off the bottom where ADX is below 20. So look at the bar prior to the vertical line...that is where the trigger was met. Any and all comments are welcome. Thanks, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi Canuck, That's great. Thanks for the input.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Canuck, I have just done some eyeballing and it seems on a few of occasions that it trades a couple of times during one smooth move on the adx. Adx has not decreased and then increased. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Please post screen shot

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi Canuck, Actualy looking at it I think the dmi has gone through 20 and then pulled back lower and then gone through. This is where the addtional trade has come from. I have attached a screenshot.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
AC, Have a look at attached...I believe it meets your rules. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Canuck, You are correct.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
hi acartwright, nothing abt dmi but just want to seek your opinion abt trading as a profession. a lot of my friends are telling me in order to trade correctly &amp; professionally, i have to go to the trading arcade, rent a place &amp; get the system there and trade from there. from your experience, can trading from home be possible in the long term? i'm fairly new &amp; joining the trading arcade is like a huge overhead for me. it costs like gbp 2.5k-3k a month. tks....

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi holmes, Only you can decide what to do. First you need experience in watching the markets so you can trad ethe right signals. There is no quick fix for this - it just takes time. Always demo trade new strategies and then take implementaiton from there. Sorry to be so vague.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
thanks so much for your reply....appreciate that. may know are you trading full time from home as well at the moment? tks....

--- 帖子 #391 ---
1 hr euro, went short 1.3970 bearish crossover with -dmi 25 &amp; +dmi 16....adx also went up from 22.7 to 23....after falling from 50 level. macd line also below signal. stop is at 1.3986, 1 tick above high of indicating bar. but thinking of moving stop higher to ard 1.4030-35 level (just above res).

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I liked your adx system and was wondering if you still trade with this method? I've been experimenting with the macd settings and possibly a 5 13 1 setting works better. We are only long if histo is above zero and histo must have increased at close. The adx conditions ( your rules) must have already been met. (opp for short) If you have time I would be interested in your thoughts on this and any help is appreciated. Cheers Iamfx

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi Iamfx, Thnaks for you post. Yes I am still currently trading this method but the interest in the thread has died down a little so I have not posted for a while. I have been constnaly refinign the system to make sure I trade the very best of set ups. I will have a look at your MACD settings to see how well they work. In addition I have been thinking to myself why are some moves bigger than others. After a lot of manual backtesting I believe the best set ups occur when price has broken out of s/r or trendlines. The ADX if in the correct position adds to the move as the breakout is also a strong directional move also. I have pretty much cancelled the signals where the trade onyl moves a few pips. Try drawing trendlines and you will see when you get a signal from the system the move is larger than a non breakout. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Impressed reading this thread. I hope you continue to post your findings as you continue to learn. I will be following along learning. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #395 ---
G'day ACartwright Thanks for your reply. Could you suggest any method for avoiding these short trades? Hope I have your method right. Cheers

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Iamfx, I have provided a screenshot that shows other factors that can be used before initializing a trade. This includes s/r and trendlines.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Forgot to add--has anyone noticed that the signal is more reliable when the adx turns up from close to the baseline?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
This is true but you have to remember that the indicator follows price and not the other way around. A large move on the ADX is only so due to the large move in price. When we can identify a strong breakout in price this means that the ADX will travel further. If in a range and the price is near a resistance point there will only be a small movement in the adx. What we are trying to do is to trade a breakout which has directional movement behind it (i.e dmi correct and ADX increasing). This is in contrast to trading a spike going thorugh a resistance point with no strength. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
G'day ACartwright Thanks for your replies I know I should be trading with the trend its just that the signals come through infrequently with this system and some retracements are good winners so I tend to take these signals as well.(incidentally I didnt take those gbp/jpy shorts) Being in front of the screen when a good signal comes through is the hard thing---this is why ea's are so popular. Cheers

--- 帖子 #400 ---
You are correct some retracement are good winners. This is also the reason why I use MACD crossing signal line without worying to much if the cross was above or below zero. What you need to look for in any direction is if price has broken through any s/r. This often leads to a larger move. If price has not broken through look to see where possible reversals will be. You can then calcualte your risk to potential win.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
It seems the macd line being above the zero line denotes a good solid long trend and vise versa. The zero line seems to act as a 50 ma. The signal and macd line seem to act as a 10 and 20 ma.
