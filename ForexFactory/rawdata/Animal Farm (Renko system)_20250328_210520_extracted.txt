Animal Farm. Read the book and figure out who the pigs are. Let’s make some pork chops. Please note that there is an error on post # 264 on page 14. Here is how it should read: "The first rule is: A new LH cannot be identified until price moves past the previous low. A new HL cannot be identified until price moves past the previous high. To make charts easier to interpret this, I use Bill Williams Fractals to identify the LL LH HH LH turns in the market." ******************************************************************************************************************************* This thread is a place where we can try to develop some new ideas for trading Renko, particularly Median Renko Charts. I have read over the other Renko Threads on Forex Factory and as I like to give credit where it is due I suggest that anyone who has little or no knowledge of Renko gives those threads a visit and studies the materials there. I will cite sources for any tools that I use here, particularly the various eas that can be used to draw Renko Charts on MT4. In doing so, I thank the programmers who have labored over these and salute them for sharing so generously. I am not a person who particularly likes indicators. I would rather develop my own understanding of price action to the point where I don’t need a lagging indicator or, worse yet, many of them. Price is what I use to make my decisions with. Having said that I do have indicators on my chart for two reasons: 1. I like an indicator that helps me determine if I am in a trend or a counter-trend move. For this, I use a 5 34 5 MACD, with a 5 period EMA superimposed on it. I like the 5 34 5 MACD because I can use it to count Elliott Waves. More simply it is used to easily identify trend and counter trend moves. I am a big fan of Elliott Wave Theory but I will really simplify that, just as Renko simplifies a lot of things. If you have Elliott Wave issues I sympathize. I see so much Elliott Wave Analysis by people who are just bull artists, and the whole subject gets a bad name. I use Elliott Wave analysis; it is not a simple topic. I will try to make it very simple. If you object to Elliott Wave move on. If you have an open mind, let’s see what I can teach you. I will say right now, that I am not here to debate the topic of Elliott Wave with naysayers. It is very useful to me. If you have an issue with that - go somewhere else. 2. The De Mark/Mouteki indicator draws Trend lines that are appropriate. You can soon draw these trend lines properly yourself and the De Mark Indicator is no longer needed. It is nice to keep it around as it does some work for you and it also sounds an alert. It also locates Fractals and some pivots. Fractals are really magical but again, like Elliott Wave, a lot of people don’t understand Fractals. 3. Fractals. Chart decorations or symbols that draw your attention to important places on the chart? You can easily train your eyes to find Fractals and pivots on any chart, including Renko charts. Do you need to have them drawn on the chart? Personally, I am trying to get away from all the tree ornaments that people hang all over their charts. I think that in due course that the fractal indicator will no longer be needed on your charts. Your choice anyway. 4. Renko. Anything on a chart that is not price is superfluous in my opinion. Renko is purely price. I have no doubt that people will turn up with all kinds of indicators. Here is something that I would urge all traders to try. I think of it as the acid test for indicators. It is from page 85 of Bill Williams’ book, “New Trading Dimensions.” “It is possible to trade profitably using only this oscillator and without even knowing what the current price is. … Think about other trader’s reactions when you say that you can trade profitably without even looking at the price chart or asking the current price.” I have been at this for a long time and I have developed a lot of indicators and tested hundreds more. If you have an indicator that meets the above standard it will be of interest, otherwise it is not. Final word on indicators: Later, I will use indicators that give an alert at places or conditions on the chart where I need to pay attention. I am a busy person and I do not want to sit and stare at a computer waiting for something to happen. I like to hear a preliminary alert and then a confirming alert that tells me a trade opportunity has arrived. I think of these more as alert systems than indicators. I will get to those alerts, but not yet; one step at a time. ****************************************************************************************************************************** 5 34 5 MACD with a 5 EMA superimposed for analysis. De Mark Trend Lines and Renko for trading signals. Fractals at turning points. Eventually it will just be the Renko chart, the MACD and a couple of alerts that prove to be useful and your brain. ****************************************************************************************************************************** Indicators, scripts, templates and PDF files will all be posted here: Some good scripts, to help manage the trades: Clean up all objects. Close and reverse. Close all orders specific pair. (Additional scripts will be added later.) Optional: Profit Tracker. To keep track of how we are doing.

Post 2. Getting set up. It is really annoying when someone joins a discussion and demands that everyone stops what they are doing to answer a question that that has already been covered. If you have had a post 2 referral, you need to read through this material and probably the first post above as well. (all the indicators, scripts and PDF files are there.) I believe that a lot of the annoying questions people will ask can be answered with a post 2 referral. (I will try to add a FAQ at bottom of this page if I can access it and edit it.) ***************************************************************************************************************************** Acknowledgements: All of the indicators, scripts and the Renko eas are from Forex Factory sources and as such I believe they are public domain and free for others to use. I would like to thank Fxred for the RenkoLiveChart_Better3.301_fxred ea. I would also like to acknowledge the programmers who wrote the De Mark Trend line indicator and the useful scripts. Additional thanks Bill Williams. "Trading Chaos" is the best book I have ever read about trading. ***************************************************************************************************************************** Renko Basics and setting up the charts: Read the Renko basics and setting up the charts PDF attached to the first post. (Differences: You will have to add the RenkoLiveChart_Better3.301_fxred ea and look for a M6 chart, not the RenkoLiveChart_v3.2 and M4 as the pdf says.) Minimize the M1 chart. Its only purpose is to feed data to the offline M2 chart. You need the M1 chart open to make this all work, but other than having it to host the Renko EA, it will not be used at the present time. ******************************************************************************************************************************* Scripts. Copy the scripts from post 1 into the Experts Scripts folder in MT4. I like to keep the scripts that I use most often in the Favorites. While MT4 is running, go to the Navigator and select Common, then Scripts. Right-click on any script that you want to add to the Favorites menu. I suggest that you add all of these scripts to favorites, as you will use them frequently. Experiment with them and get used to them before you use them in any trades. ***************************************************************************************************************************** Template: If we all use the same template it is really helpful when we discuss a chart. The #RenkoLite template is in post 1. #RenkoLite is Median Renko with De Mark only. MACD will come later. ******************************************************************************************************************************* KISS. Some people have charts with so many indicators on them it is nearly impossible to see the price. Those charts will get a KISS post 2 referral.

Add the RenkoLiveChart_Better3.301_fxred ea to your M1 chart. (God Bless that man.) 4. Right click. Select Expert Advisors Properties. Make sure that it looks like the picture below . 5. Wait a few seconds for the EA to start working. 6. Check the upper right hand corner for a smiley face and then read the upper left hand corner. 7. Go to File, open offline, scroll down until you find the EURUSD M6 chart and open it. 8. Open the #RenkoLite template on your M6 EURUSD chart. 9. Minimize the M1 chart do not close it. It is needed to feed data to the offline chart and is essential. 10. Make sure you are opening the M6 offline EURUSD chart and still have your M1 EURUSD chart running with RenkoLiveChart_Better3.301_fxred ea on it. 11. If you can’t get it working read the PDF again. ******************************************************************************************************************************* FAQ.

OK let’s start with very clean charts. Let’s also keep it polite and positive. (Slagging lawyers is allowed if/when you need to vent any frustrations.) Renko first. I will start with the EURUSD - showing a 4 pip block Median Renko chart. If you have installed the ea and the #renkolite template your chart should be similar. (Your broker's data may cause some differences.) The chart shows a wealth of information, but it is late now and I have to take the dog for his walk.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
It is raining and the dog was not enthusiastic. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have a look at the wicks in the chart and how they relate to fractals. Any observations?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Fractals would be excessively laggy as a trigger indicator for renko charts. They don't form until 2 closed bars after you actually see them...where would you be with an entry? Link .

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hello Magix. Thanks for asking that question and being my first poster on Animal Farm. I agree, fractals are lagging because of the fact that it takes at least five bars to form them. Renko is good in that it removes a lot of the fractals that form on a time based chart. The use of fractals will be a part of my method here and I hope to show some really good ways to use them. I use fractals to help identify the Elliott Wave structure in the chart. They are excellent when it comes to identification of the trend, potential breakouts and stop locations. Bill Williams states that between every opposing pair of fractals there is an Elliott Wave of some degree. They are very powerful in that respect. I don't want to get into EW too heavily here, just touch on the easy useful stuff. If you can make it work you don't have to know why it works - unless sort of thing really intrigues you. Fractals are also used to draw trend lines. (When we add the De Mark indicator to the chart, that use of fractals will become apparent.) If we look at the above EURUSD Median Renko chart, the wicks often form at the middle or peak candle of a fractal, or on the next candle past it. That effectively tells us that a fractal is forming one or two bars ahead of its actual complete formation. Of the twenty five wicks on the chart, only four did not identify fractals. So the wicks are a reasonably good alert that a fractal is forming, before it actually does. That in itself is a heads-up and removes one or two bars of lag. I haven't done a statistical study on that occurrence, maybe someone would like to at some point. Anyhow the use of fractals will be a feature here and at first the lag aspect of the entry may be annoying but it can be improved on as we go.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I look forward to a fresh new market perspective.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Here is one important use of fractals: Identifying the trend. (I am using the USDCAD to illustrate a nice trend here that yielded some good trades today.) HH = Higher High. HL = Higher Low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Forget "trend" indicators, price action alone tells us where the trend really is. Renko, De Mark trend lines and Fractals. We will put them together next, but it is nearly midnight Mountain Standard Time and I am signing off for now.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello WAB, This indicator could help newbies to indentify trend like in your previous picture! Hope it will be of help,if not I will remove it (just say it WAB)! Highest regards!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks Zokynho. I actually have a similar indicator and use it myself. Yours is a bit better actually. However you have to follow the rule that a new LH cannot be verified until price has broken out below the previous LH. The indicator that I have and the one you have posted do not do that. If I could find an indicator that actually did follow that rule, I would absolutely use it. Have a look at the chart to see what I mean. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The black LL LH labels are the ones that I have determined. Your indicator and mine both label the fractals the same way. I put yours on the chart to illustrate the difference between an indicator labeling LL LH or HH HL and doing it yourself. I added horizontal red lines to show where the price breaks below each LL. There are nine that have broken down and one still pending if the down move continues. Eight of them are in profit the ninth is in a small loss position. Stops are moved down on each of the LH fractals as a new LL fractal breaks out. I added vertical lines from the entry levels to the close to see what each trade is currently worth. The stop at the most recent LH is about 40 pips, so if the market decided to go up now, the last opened position would lose about 60 pips the second last one would break even and all the others would end up in a profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) No indicators required. Nine trades, eight with locked in profits, one potential break-even, one small loss if the market turns up and a pending tenth trade if it continues to move down. Renko makes this much easier to do than on a regular chart. Fractals are very useful but the correct HH HL LL LH count is what makes it work. Learn to count the HH HL LL LH properly and you will be miles ahead of most people trying to trade. You will also be half way towards discovering Elliott Wave all by yourself. Soon you don't even need the fractals on the chart to do this. I hope the charts are not too confusing. When you have done this for a while your eye is trained to pick it out easily. It takes practice.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hey Wab, Thanks for great explanation and your time.I understand what you mean and definately agree with you. For renko we don't need indicators as many of them showing the same thing as renko.We need to learn about PA (when is market trending,when is in range periods and support and resistance zones) and all will be good. I also like to use one higher brick size renko for longer term trend and one smaller to go with trend! KISS principles are best, Wish you luck with your thread and many green pips Highest regards!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks Zokynho. There was a FR Scanner indicator, posted on FxRed's thread, that supposedly shows the status of the different block sizes on you chart. I haven't had a chance to really check it out and see if really does what it says it does. When a bigger brick swings into line with a smaller brick breakout it is powerful stuff. I will start into the De Mark lines next. Good luck with your trading.

Looking interesting WAB. I'll follow along. Might be worth letting people unfamiliar with Renko on MT4 that the charts won't load when your broker is closed. The Renko EA needs incoming ticks to work, so if you're loading this up on a weekend, you'll have to wait for the Sunday night open, or use one of those bits of software which sends "fake" ticks to your terminal.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
No-one had a go at this, so here is what I see. Wicks that form AT a fractal - these signify valid fractal. Wicks that form at bar 4 of a fractal - again, these signify a valid fractal. Wicks that form on 3 bar reversal - assuming I understand what you mean by 3 bar reversal - these seems to fail, as far as formation of a fractal goes, and are therefore potentially good indications of continuation......

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hey wab, Good work! I am exciting to read the Entry/Exit rules because i am a renko fan and trade my own system which is also based on renko. Best Regards, PrinceWahaj

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Wab... I must be missing something. (No real surprise there) You mention and marked 25 wicks, yet there seem to be other wicks on the chart. What is the criteria for a "wick". Is it only when it is against the current direction (showing a possible reversal in sentiment)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi spyderman and Gt3Rs I assume that you mean the chart on post 4. My old eyes are not what they once were, and I did miss at least one wick that I noticed on a re-examine. Maybe I missed more?. What I am trying to point out, is that when you get a wick in a median Renko chart and it forms on a brick with a color change, it is often serving notice that a fractal will form there, before the fractal is actually confirmed. This becomes very useful later on. Sometimes the three bar reversal, like a fractal but with only three bars, is also significant. At the moment I am not explaining it that well. Once we get in to some charts I hope I can use actual examples to make things more clear. Meantime if you look over the pdf attached, you may notice that some of the De Mark Trend lines are drawn form fractals and some from ... let's call them three bar patterns. Consider that a lot of De marks points, from which he draws trend lines, are actually part of a fractal anyway. Maybe that helps. I am sure that the charts will provide many examples. Here is a chart where the De mark points are shown as small circles. I have also displayed the MT4 Fractals and you will find three De Mark circles that I have labelled that are not fractals. (There are more than three, I just selected some for examples.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) What we are going to do is anticipate where De Mark lines will be drawn before they are actually drawn. The Median Renko wicks enable us to do this. Fractal breakout trades are good (see post 10) but I think we can get improve on those. Stay tuned.

Looking forward to it.

Well the Renko bar drought that occurs every weekend is over. I was busy working on a set of rings for a couple getting married on New Years Eve, so I was not looking at the EURUSD. Let's see what is happening with the De Mark Tend Lines (DMTL). Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you are familiar with DMTL they are drawn from the most recent fractal (usually) or De Mark point to the previous one. Set "Show Arrows" to "True and the little circles (mostly at fractals) will appear on your chart. An upper line is drawn to the first previous one that is higher. A lower line is drawn to the first previous one that is lower. On the chart we can see that the previous lower fractal was quite some distance back. This occurs in a down trend. The upper line finds a previous higher fractal a lot closer. A subtle clue about trend direction to be aware of. How far away does the DMTL indicator have to look to find the previous qualifying fractal? I am going to get a little lazy her and call all the points that the DMTL uses to construct trend lines fractals, even though some of them are not fractals. I will also leave the MT4 Fractals off the chart so that it does not become cluttered. Now, I am going back to work on those rings and will check in later.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
... later. The chart is cooperating nicely and allowing me to illustrate: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The DMTL has changed. Its previous position is noted with a black line. Price went down and formed a fractal and a supply DTML line formed there. Price then went back upwards to form another up fractal. Now look at the up fractal. At the peak of the fractal (middle block or block three) there is a wick. If you were watching, a block later, the DTML conditions are satisfied and the DMTL is re-drawn to its present position. A short entry below the wick block is good. Two blocks later out fractal is verified. Also an entry if you like, but not as good as the wick entry two blocks earlier. The arrival of the DTML line on the wick is like a confirmation of an entry. We are taking short trades because the overall LL LH trend is intact and we keep a stop loss above the last up fractal.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
And the action continues. THE DMTL adjusts. More wicks form a block before the DMTL forms and up to two blocks before a fractal is verified. Attached Image (click to enlarge) We monitor the last LL and if price moves lower we have a confirmed LH. ( I have to go show rings to my customers. No time to trade right now.) Hopefully you can begin to see the potential here. As soon as I am able, I will enter a trade or two. Meantime monitor that potential LH, which will be confirmed with a break below the last LL. Watch for the wicks and then the DMTL and the fractal following behind them.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Interesting thread. I have one question, how do you enter with a strong move, when price moving fast there is renko candle is popping one buy one ? How do you identify range market, HH and HL in range will be a killer ? I had some experience with renko, it was interesting, but problem was when market was moving to fast. I called one point reversal, you marked it as fractal. It worked in the range, losses was small. You have one candle reversal, wait for the second to close, buy, SL as on the chart. TP or close loss when two candle close against you. Like on the chart

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Sorry for bothering you with a questions, what about this situation ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Looking at your chart, you have a series of HH HL so buying at any of the previous up fractals would get you in. You also have wick signals on three of the first four HL fractals so buying on a retrace and a wick signal is possible, but the swings are small so the advantage is minimal. Entering where you placed your buy line is great. Entering at the previous block, which shows a wick, would be one block better. Again, a minimal advantage in a strong bullish chart. We can't see the chart to the left, maybe a DMTL entry would also have shown up. Your TP is good but I would not label the last up fractal as a LH. Price has to break a previous HL fractal first and form a LL fractal before it can rally to form a HL The new HL fractal can't be confirmed until price then breaks the LL fractal. This is an important concept and I will come back to it repeatedly. It will all come clear in time with more examples. Something else I will get to, is how do we manage trades like this and get that to that TP with out sitting at the monitor? We are just getting going. Thanks to everyone for dropping in. I found out along time ago that the best way to learn something is to try and teach it to someone else.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
monocor, if you look at post 8 it shows the correct way to approach a HH HL LL LH count. If you can post your second chart again, without all the labels, I will show you how I do it. If I can quote myself: "This is an important concept and I will come back to it repeatedly. It will all come clear in time with more examples."

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I didn't market those labels, I just dropped the indicator from first page. I wasn't looking at labels. I am just saying, that I used to trade, in that way, move up, one candle red, two green after that buy, and wait for two red candles one by one to close. But problem was with a speed, as renko doesn't have time for the close. Some times market is moving so fast, that you can't get in the trade.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Here is the chart. Thank you for your help!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Why is it that everyone keeps "looking forward to a fresh new market perspective" when supposedly, they were making great profits with their "same 'ole" perspective. Same shit. Different day. Human nature I suppose.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Old is gold ! For me it's new. I am trading sonic + my own system. And never worked with fractals. If you had experience, you can always share

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Yeah...some people never change...

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Okay - sorry I missed the real question there. A lot of people use that two bar approach on Renko and it works well enough. There is a You Tube Video where the trader tests it over along period and it is interesting. Inserted Video The speed at which a strong move develops is an issue for sure. One solution is using bigger blocks and pending orders if you can figure out where to put them. We will work on that. I am using small blocks to get lots of examples. Part of what I find useful is getting an understanding of the trend by doing the HH HL LL LH analysis. Here is my version of it on your previous chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You will notice a lot less labels. Mastering this type of trend analysis is critical. Once you know how the market is climbing or descending stairs it gets a lot easier to make sense of it.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Whoops I noticed a mistake ... the second to last LL should be one more fractal /circle to the right. (Told you mastering this is critical.)

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Let's see how that EURUSD is doing. I have marked WE (wick entry levels) and FC fractal (confirmation levels) as they have occurred. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now what will happen at the lower DMTL? A wick or a break?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Than you for your help! I get used more to the swings, it is hard with fractals. What would you do in that sircle area, there would be a loss ? And where do you take profit ? Do you wait for Sl, or you cut your losses before price get SL ? May be you can show some trades for better understanding. Thank you! Best regards !

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Question is, why do you feel the need to pollute every thread in ff with your worthless bullshit? Dude is getting a start on his thread, if you have nothing to add, why bother posting? As a fellow Canuck and Albertan...I like to chat with folk close to home, and haven't seen this approach. Ergo, different shit, different day. Now, move along. Wanker.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
monocor I would need to see more of the chart to the left to determine how the market structure was working. At a glance I would say that it is in a wave four and those are where most people give back their profits as the market chops back and forth. If you can determine the HH HL sequence in there it will keep you out of trouble. If you know where it confirms a breakout and wait for it it saves a lot of grief. Thanks for defending a fellow Canuck Magix. What part of Alberta? Slim, maybe I can show you something or maybe not. It is very early in the game here. I hope that you make a million man.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
OK here we go. Price breaks the DMTL and closes below it. No block color change, wick or fractal forming. It also breaks the last LL fractal and confirms the new LH fractal in the process. Trend is still down. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In Calgary. Figured when you said you were MST, you were a little closer. Still a pretty close neighbour.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Half of Calgary is here to ski and the conditions are just ice. My stop was hit. If it breaks above the last LH it is reversing. I should have has the stop there but broke my own rule. In front of an audience too. Doing this live on line, is going to be tough. Now I have to watch it go back towards the LH and look for an entry when it turns - if the LH holds. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Stop is at the LH. Let's see how this does. I will leave a trade manager to trail a stop at each fractal. Way past my bed time.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I managed to get a small profit, getting stopped out at the first fractal while I was asleep. Then the market did a turn around. First it broke above the small red LL LH sequence at the thin red line then it took out the last LH at the thick red line and really that confirms it is now heading up making a series of HH HL as it goes. Each HL has provided and nice wick entry. If I can, between other activities, will try and catch the next one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Having to sleep now and then makes for some missed trades, but more come along all the time.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Think I'm starting to get what you're saying about the correct reading on the HH HL LL LH, etc. Takes a bit of getting used to.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Wab, I appreciate your willingness to share. Is the below set up correct and would you take a short (overlooking the fact that it is a holiday season). thanks again. regards,

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Looks good pappi. I actually took that trade as the HH HL sequence changed to LL LH. I will post the EURUSD chart and it really has some good examples. With New Years and so forth, I have not been able to really sit down to this but that will change once things settle down. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There is a load of information on this chart. I don't have time to go into it all now but will do so later. Meantime have a look and see what makes sense and what doesn't. Happy New Year. May 2014 be the year the pips rain down on us.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hey Wab...thanks for the update. I had marked up this EU chart prior to your post to see if I was getting the idea. No entries though. I thought that last LL would be valid as price just broke the previous LL, which would seem to make that previous fractal a LH. Then that HH which I marked too soon...should wait till price breaks the new LL. So am I missing something. Does price have to close or breech by a certain amount to be a valid new LL. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi spyderman. It takes a bit of head-wrapping-around to get this. (I will have to put together a graphic.) Compare your count to mine. I do not label an LH until price breaks below the previous LL. We can only know that it is an LH after that happens. I have added some more info to the chart showing possible WE bullish trades, that I did not take as I was busy setting rubies. I have also updated the LL LH fractals at the right. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next bullish reversal is confirmed when price breaks back above the last LH that we have confirmed. We may get more so just keep tracking them as they form and are confirmed by a break belwo the last LL. (Another set of LL LH have formed while I write this, so my reversal level is now on a lower confirmed LH as price breaks its last LL.) Once you can see this you will never again believe any of the so-called "trend indicators" which mostly get it wrong. Now look at all of the bearish WE locations that were there for the plucking.

A parable about indicators. A Mafia Godfather finds out that his bookkeeper, Enzo, has cheated him out of 10 million bucks. His bookkeeper is deaf. That was the reason he got the job in the first place. It was assumed that Enzo would hear nothing that he might have to testify about in court. When the Godfather goes to confront Enzo about his missing $10 million, he takes along his lawyer who knows sign language. The Godfather tells the lawyer, "Ask him where the 10 million bucks is that he embezzled from me. The lawyer, using sign language, asks Enzo where the money is. Enzo signs back, "I don't know what you are talking about." The lawyer tells the Godfather, "He says he doesn't know what you are talking about." The Godfather pulls out a pistol, puts it to Enzo's temple and says, "Ask him again!" The lawyer signs to Enzo, "He'll kill you if you don't tell him." Enzo signs back, "OK. You win! The money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed in my Cousin Bruno's backyard! The Godfather asks the lawyer, "What did he say?" The lawyer replies, " He says you don't have the balls to pull the trigger." Indicators are like lawyers. Don’t trust them. They often lie and you have to recognize that as a fact. Learn to read the signs yourself. (Note: Any lawyers reading this are probably doing so on time that they are also billing clients for.)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks Wab for the update. Yeah I think I get most of that. My question is on the fractal I have marked LL on this chart. It just broke the previous LL by a pip. Is that enough to constitute a new LL. If so then would that confirm the new LH circled? Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A break is a break. Very close LL fractals might be a double bottom, but usually it is pretty clear. Sometimes the retrace levels are very close and can cause confusion. I will get to that eventually when I add a bit of Elliott Wave.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I checked the chart and after a more careful look ... sorry I missed that. ( A good student will always excel the teacher.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) There were two situations where the fractals were very close, making it hard to figure out the sequence. I would change time frames in a regular chart to sort that out. Going to a higher time frame often clears up any confusion. I haven't experimented enough with different sized Renko blocks but the same trick would probably work. I know some people keep two or three charts with different size blocks running. Anyone with thoughts/ experience on that please jump in. The DMTL also helps when that second LL swings slightly lower and it adjusts and gets your attention. Another thing I do is use the 5 34 5 MACD to figure out possible Elliott Wave counts. (We haven't got to that yet.) I really don't want to get all EW on everybody at this point. I will try to give ways to get around the dreaded wave four correction which always causes confusion. Here is an EW view for those interested. All kinds of people will now jump up and down and offer their view of my count, but as I said, I will try to avoid that and mostly keep this EW free. Just be suspicious of fractals that are very close to each other in price. Here is an EW view for those that might see how it applies. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Again, I don't want to get this all EW oriented. As the charts evolve the method will become more clear. I appreciate people like spyderman who call my attention to the things that I miss and thereby help me polish this. Now, I am signing off for New Year's Eve in the Rocky Mountains. Where's my party hat?

Anything with pigz in the higher hierarchy amuses me. Next, Ill read and Ill listen carefully..

Welcome aboard 21vs7. At one time in his life, my father in law raised pigs. One day the government inspector came to visit and asked his wife where he was. "He is out in the barn with the pigs,"she replied. "He is the one with the hat on." **************************************************************************************************************************** CRL. I want to take the opportunity to stress an important point. From now on I will try to conscientiously add a line on the charts that I will label as the current reversal level. CRL. I encourage readers to do the same. Will I always get it right? Will it always work? No. But it will work often enough and as you try to add it you will get very good at it and find it becomes part of your price action analysis. The CRL will be the most recent confirmed LH or HL. It marks the level at which a trend of HH HL reverses or a trend of LL LH reverses. (In Elliott Wave it is where wave three is confirmed as it breaks past wave 2 or wave C is confirmed as it breaks past wave A. Not that we need to worry about that too much. I am trying to keep this as Elliott free as I can.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the market breaks above this CRL level a reversal in trend has occurred. If a new LH forms we should move our CRL down to the new LH fractal. The CRL is always at the most recent confirmed LH or HL. Note: There is one place where we will not necessarily have a turn that occurs on a fractal. I mention it now because I don't want you thinking I am making it up a as I go along. I will be sure to point it out when it occurs and will refer back to this note if questions arrive.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Summary: I have tried to lay the groundwork of using fractals to count the HH HL LL LH sequence. I have discussed the importance of wicks on median Renko bars where a color change occurs. I have touched on the significance of where wicks occur in a fractal and how they predict fractal formations. I have pointed out that not all De Mark Trend Line points are fractals but all fractals have the necessary three point patterns that DMTL uses. I have discussed the fractal where a trend reversal can occur. Abbreviations: HH ... Higher High. HL ... Higher Low. LL ... Lower Low. LH ... Lower High. WE ... Wick Entry. FC ... Fractal Confirmation. CRL .. Current Reversal Level. I think I have established the basis for a system and I am ready to take it in some different directions. First of all, I think I will try to catch some trades (as time permits) and field any questions. Time to go play some New Year's Hockey and relax for a bit.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
The LH (CRL in the last chart) was broken as price moved up. It is now dropping and this is what I referred to as a point where a fractal may not form when the price turns back up. (This came up quickly, as I thought it might , so I am glad that I mentioned it in post 53.) I am looking for a fractal or at least DMTL point, a change in the location of the green DMTL and a WE to go long form. Let's see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Wab, why do you over complicating so simple things. Just follow the order flow and that is it. What is the point of Fractal ? Wave counting ? We have been trading this way for years already, it is sonic R system, it is works with candles, bars, renko, you can take any chart, order flow every where is gonna be the same. I don't like renko 4, I prefer renko 10, because it doesn't have so much noise. But here is the entry, from today, every thing simple. Brake of the base, HL, low swing poin, any way, wait for retrace to dragon and two renko candle same colour in the direction of the move, and sell.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
WAB, this doesn't work with trading, there is no such a thing like here this way and there is another way. You should have hard rules, entry, SL, BE, TP. Only in this way you can make profit. You gonna have to make a plan, place everything together, make testing, or at least back testing. And after show it to public. Right now you have a mess with all information that you gave, showing how much pips you could make with a history, and trading live it is a big difference !

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Monocor... Why in the world are you trashing Wad's trading system when he hasn't even finished explaining it. He's delivering it at his own pace which is his prerogative as the thread OP. If you don't like what you see and have a better way, start your own thread. Or go over to sonic R and post there. I just can't understand peoples need to come on these threads and tear everything down. Wad...looking forward to hearing more. It may not end up being right for me, but I'll never know if I don't listen.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I am most interested in learning these concepts, price action is so important and Wab is stressing it.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I am one with spyderman, Wad, we are all interested in your Renko trading research, don't care about the "strangers". I have been "playing" with Renkos for about two years now. And thanks monocor for introducing Sonic R!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Lovely.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Monocor. I guess I find it necessary to explain simple concepts. Often when you try to explain why a simple thing works, that explanation makes it seem complex. I no longer add fractals to my charts but I use them all the time and need to explain that. The wick/fractal relationship is interesting to understand but you can use it without understanding it. The HH HL LL LH analysis is a good one to go through on any chart in my opinion. The place where a trend reversal will occur is always good knowledge to have and or operate from. Of course you don’t know if it will happen until it happens, but knowing where it could happen is very useful. As I mentioned earlier, moving to a higher time frame or bigger block clears up a lot of confusion. I am using small blocks here to illustrate as the price action forms more quickly. If you have several different trading systems that work they will all point to the same places where the trading opportunity happens. I believe that we all trade our understanding of that in many different ways and eventually find one that works for us. Anyhow, we are all here to learn and become better traders, or we wouldn’t be here. And any and all input is valuable if it is meant to be that. I am certainly not in the Sonic R league and can only aspire. Meantime, maybe there is an additional morsel of material, that I will offer, that is of use to others. I will be adding a lot of ideas here and you can pick or chose if any are of use to you. Now, having said all that, what is next? Let’s look at a trade using 8 pips blocks and discuss various ways to manage it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) First of all, I somewhat relied on the DMTL here to convince me to go short. There was no wick bar and two red bars needed to give me a fractal confirmation. Two red bars needed by most people who trade Renko, but I got in a bit earlier because the DMTL had adjusted. So I gained a little bit there and every bit helps. Now, I am in a short trade and I have placed my stop just above the last up fractal. Time to discuss trade management strategy. I can sit and monitor the trade, or have some sort of trade manager do that for me. There are a variety of ways to do this. On the right of my screen you will see a trailing stop program called LOC. It is a commercial product, so please do not ask me for a free copy. Look for "Land of Cash" on Forex Factory and you can find out about LOC. LOC has the ability to trail a stop in a variety of ways. On this chart I have it set to move the stop down when a new up fractal forms. That way, if I get a good move with multiple waves LOC will lock in profits fractal by fractal, until we get a market reversal. So I will let that one run and come back to it later. There are many strategies for managing trades. Another I will use, is designed to just catch the red to green green to red moves in Renko. You will not need a trade manager like LOC to do this if you can watch the trades yourself.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Here is another way to trail a stop. This time on a faster EURUSD 4 pip median Renko. (I jumped in here on the DMTL arrow, wanting to show another stop trailing method.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This time I am trailing the stop two bars back, plus a pip. I can do this manually, or let LOC do it for me. You can see here that the stop has already been moved by LOC. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The stop will be moved down based on two bars back plus a pip - programmed into LOC.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Meanwhile, the AUDJPY 8 block Renko has not broken below the last LL fractal. So I can close the trade or let it form a higher fractal and move the stop down to that level when it does and see what happens. Since we are giving LOC trailing fractals a test run I will stay with that strategy there. If I was using the two bar trail plus a pip as I am in the EURUSD, I would probably be getting stopped out around this point. I have experimented with trailing stops a lot. There are many methods: trailing on a moving average, PSAR, ATR stops and so on. I use them when I cannot sit and watch a trade, which is most of the time. They all work to some extent, some better than others. Sometimes I switch from one to the other, based on what the chart is doing. Sometimes I pick one and the other does better. I have not found a trailing stop method that works perfectly, X bars back (two bars plus a pip) or fractals stops in synch with the trend do well enough. I have pips locked in on the EURUSD now and the jury is out on the AUDJPY. I will update in a while.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I took the dog for a walk and the two bar plus a pip trail made a few dollars while I was out. LOC is a very handy tool that monitors a trade when I can't. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Wab You have been using LOC for a long time and it must have been of good value.. Today I saw that I had looked it up on another thread where you had spoken of it. Your continued use of it tells me that you have used it with more than one system and had good luck with it.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I have a LOC trailing ea as well and like it very much. When I got it I only needed/wanted the MA trailing so I get the less expensive one (19.95). Been very happy with it but would like to get the one you're using WAD, with more functionality. Appreciate the direction of the thread. Had a few questions. If I'm getting ahead just say so. Some were answered in your last post. I've noticed you seem to use a few entries...WE, break of an LL or HH, DTML signal. Do you have a criteria for which one you'll use or does it just depend. Also on the block size. Do you favor a particular size for your day to day trading. Seems like the smaller the block the more you'd be tied to your screen to catch the entries. Especially on WE entries. I guess on LL/HH breaks you would just set up a pending.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yes Blaiserboy, I have been a LOC fan for some time. I also use it when I am trading Bill Williams methods with a trailing stop on one of the Alligator displaced moving averages. Thanks for the support spyderman. If you are in the right place at the right time, the best right time being when you have established which way the trend is going, any and all of the entries are good. The WE gets you in closest to the action. A fractal confirmation is the two bar entry that most Renko traders seem to favor. A DMTL break and a fractal breakout are good for additional entries. All are price based and all good and useful. To me, trading in the same direction as the trend is most important. In my "time" based trading I prefer H1, H4 or daily charts. That way I do not have to check things very often. I can place pending orders and move stops occasionally. As for block size, small blocks will do to illustrate and test the strategies. Bigger blocks are preferred but I have not established a favorite size yet. Maybe someone with more experience can add to that thought. When you use bigger blocks the X bar stop will have to be modified a bit.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
It looks like the AUDJPY 8 trade is about to form an up fractal. We have a wick entry as well. If it does form an up fractal, LOC will move the stop down to it as soon as it breaks below the last down fractal. That would also trigger a DTML signal to go short as the lower trend line would break. It all works together and a lot of it becomes surplus as we gain experience. (I left the fractals turned on to illustrate them. LOC does not need to have them on the chart.) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #70 ---
A benefit of the small blocks is that the trader has to be sharp in order to get satisfactory exits and entries. This is good exercise for learning some concepts.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Here is how the AUDJPY trades worked out with fractal stops. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hold that thought Blaiserboy. There are mixed benefits to having smaller blocks. Think of adding on a trade at every new block. I was at a friend's house tonight and we had a really nice 4 pip block run that started with a 5 pip risk and went to 30 plus pips in a few minutes. Adding on at each new block would have really upped the score there. What you end up with is an arithmetic progression and each new block rapidly gets to be worth a lot of pips while the risk is controlled nicely with an X bars trailing stop. At some point I hope a good programmer is interested in that. I have written an Excel Spreadsheet that shows how the math of that works, but let's hold that thought back for a bit. Too many things at once and we will just have total confusion. How about some useful alert indicators next? A sound alert when a wick forms for example? Coming up soon.

Hello Everybody ! I didn't mean to create a mess in this thread, my apologies for that, I just want more specific information Wab. I would like to make a contribution to this forum. I spend some time to get all information about fractals and see how it works, and how to use it with order flow, I found the way. It is kind of complicated, especially with Renko 4 bar, price is moving fast, you have to be very quick. But it works. I will place some charts. Wab I need your help, can you explain how do you place orders ? And stop loss? Trailing doesn't work well, as I want to follow fractals until we have brake in direction.

Nice trades monocor, what Renko settings are you using, your charts look different to mine? Compare this to your first chart, I'm using settings as Wab shows in post 2

It nice trades, but it is not what I really trade. It was just the main idea of order flow.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I can show you what I am really trade, sorry I don't use MT4 for order placing, I can't show you my trades on the chart. I am trading only patterns. It is really profitable. I want to make a deal, I need 10 vouchers, to get a full access on forex factory. I will show you one pattern, if you will trade it you will be profitable for long time. Try this way, if you like it vouch for me, please. Here is the chart, where I show my way of trading. I am using BB100, Macd 12 26 9 (standard), and round levels 50 and 100. Price has to brake or pin through BB, and pattern has to accrue, with divergence on MACD. One important advise, watch for the levels, if you want to open a trade, and you have a level right in front of you, skip that trade

Hi everybody. I have been battling the elements. We had some minus 35 weather then it warmed up and rained. The rain just froze to the ground and made a barrier of ice a foot thick or more. Then it warmed up and snowed and then rained again. The result was a large pond around one side of my house. I have never had a water problem there before. So I have been breaking ice, pumping water and trying to stay ahead of a potential problem. We are getting a pine-apple express, warm moist air from the Pacific. It hits the Rocky Mountains, cools off and dumps precipitation on us. If it is snow the ski hill rejoices but they are shut down today with high winds and rain. Not all bad though. I did get two fantastic days of skiing in. Thanks to all for keeping the thread going while I was other-wise occupied. Tonight I will post a promised indicator, a wick alert really, and try to answer some questions. I will also show you how I use a second LOC trailing method that I have found good with Renko. Back to the pump as it is raining again. So far so good.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Nice to see you again WAB. Sorry about the weather problems. Seems many are really getting hammered. Look forward to hearing more from you.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Attached, is a semi-useful alert for when a wick occurs on a Median Renko Chart. Use these settings: Attached Image You will have to re-set it if you have closed a Renko Chart just select Edit and then re-open it. It sounds an alert and prints an arrow on the chart and draws your attention to a wick brick. You can't follow it blindly but it is good for an alert. If you want to, you can compare it to fractals. I like to try and enter when the market pulls back and catch an early move on its way to a fractal break out. This helps.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Here is a theoretical diagram that I hope will make the trend analysis a bit easier to understand. Attached Image (click to enlarge) (Note that the HH HL sequence has to be counted carefully when the fractals are close in price. The area in the ellipse illustrates this.) Then we get a LL that breaks that last HL and the trend change is confirmed. The best entry we can get is as close to the first LH as we can. On a median Renko Chart that is the wick entry bar. Our stop will be just above the HH. A new flow of Supply has turned the price down at the HH and when it attempts to go higher again, we are ready for it. That first LL break below the HL red line tells us it likely can't manage to overcome the Supply Zone. Now, the price trends down with a LL LH sequence until a new HH breaks the last LH at the green line and the trend is reversing again. This time off a Demand Level. Lets look at a real time trade where this is applied.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I was a bit late getting in on this one. Still it illustrates the method nicely. I also used LOC set to trail a fractal stop. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see the Wick Alert Arrows and the De Mark Trend lines. I will add labels in a bit. See if you can figure out the best wick entry based on the first LH fractal.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
LOC waits for a fractal to form so that it can move the stop. You can do this yourself of course. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You could also take profit once you get a two bar reversal, but I am letting LOC do the trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
An up fractal forms and LOC moves the stop one pip above it, just as it is programmed to do. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Now will we get more downside action or ... will the trend reverse? Attached Image (click to enlarge) You only know after it happens. However, the green wick alerts might be getting our attention.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
And the run is ... stopped out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) LOC has stopped us out just above the place where a two bar reversal would have done the same thing. I have added labels so that you can see where the best wick entry (WE) was. We had a HH, then a reversal as the price broke the previous HL (red line) to make a LL. It then pulled back to make a HL and that was the Wick Entry I wish I was there for. (That's what happens when you eat desert.) Initial stop just above the HH then trail it down LH by LH (LOC will do that nicely.) A nice trade, even though I got in late and got stopped out. ********************************************************************************************************* I have added a MACD indicator to the bottom of the chart. Like the Wick Alert the MACD is useful when we understand where we are in the HH HL LL LH sequence. When you know that, and only then, the wick alerts and the MACD become extremely helpful. Here are the settings for the MACD. Attached Image Note the MACD Alert has an alarm for when it crosses zero. I generally leave it off. You will see what I mean when it goes off... repeatedly. Note: When you open and close your MT4 the wick alert arrows and the MACD alert will get scrambled up on the Renko Chart. Just open them, select edit, and close them to have them display properly. A lot to digest here before I get into the MACD too much. It told me that I would get another chance to go short - but I was busy writing this. (Should have had another desert.) Then it tells me that we will get a messy long correction. But, I am getting ahead of myself again.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Such a nice teaching chart. Wouldn't you know it, the MACD telling us something, right on cue. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note the bullish divergence on the 5 34 5 MACD. As I explain this wonderful indicator more you will come to know that divergence very well and what it means. (I expected a bit more of a down move after I was stopped out and I have a change in the stop strategy that would have gained another 93 but let's wait until later to see how that works. It is using LOC in X bar mode. Watch for that later.) For now let's look at the MACD divergence. That divergence just about always occurs at the end of a strong run just as a counter-trend, or a reversal arrives. This is where most traders lose their money. (The dreaded wave four in Elliott Wave terms.) I expect the MACD to climb back to zero at least and to also create a triangle full of whipsaws. In a Renko Chart this is somewhat smoothed but still a dangerous area to trade. A break of the De Mark Trend Line that will form the bottom of a triangle will tell us when to go short again. Having said all that, I did enter a long trade to demonstrate how LOC and Fractals work here. I don't expect to get much, but sometimes the correction can go on for a long time and you can gain a little. Normally I don't trade these corrections after a divergence. We may well see why, as this works out. So, not much to do now. These corrections tend to be tedious. Let's see how LOC fractal trailing does with it. I will likely be asleep as it works out. Later.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Just a view of the Renko chart when the Wick Indicator arrows and MACD get messed up. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just reset them to smarten them up.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Chart is back in shape and up a few pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will leave LOC to move stops fractal by fractal. I will not be awake for the London open, 1:00 a.m. my time, so that's it for now. ************************************************************************************************************************* Next, I will talk more about the MACD and its use. Can we do this without the Wick Alert arrows? Yes. Can we do it without the MACD? Yes. They do make it easier, but only if we use them correctly. Knowing how to identify the trend is the most important thing. Go back to the theoretical diagram in post 98 and make sure that it makes sense to you. No matter what method of trading you eventually settle for, that is the most important thing to learn.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
As expected, the counter-trend trade did not do well. It was stopped out by a fractal as the DMTL broke and signaled a short trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I added a black line to show where the DMTL was at the time. A break of that trend line was a good entry for the next down move. Now, I would like to draw your attention to the relationship between the trends and the MACD. When the MACD is below zero then it is best to only trade down moves (LH to LL) and be in synch with the LL LH sequence - until a reversal occurs. Then trade the up trend moves (HL to HH) when the MACD is above zero, and be in synch with the HH HL sequence. The purpose of the DMTL, the Wick Alert Arrows and the MACD is to help with this. In the next chart I will display the MACD trend status on the Renko candles. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The colors of the candles match the status of the MACD. Trend and counter trend above and below the zero of the MACD are now color coded right into the Renko Chart. Here are the settings. ( I leave the MTF display off.) Attached Image So lots to play with. Have a look tinker with it and see what you think. I will try to get some more charts up this evening.

Hey Wab, First i want to say thank you for all your effort and for sharing your experince with us and i have decided to learn your method as i am really frustrated with my self as i have been changing strategies and jumping around thread looking for the magical tactics and the holy grail and i don't need to tell you how that have ended but i am really optimistic with your strategy as it combine price action and simplicity and the real market flow so i will follow and hoping to finally find mu way in this f* market and make some profit . I have read what you posted till now and been practicing on how to determine Trends as you said it's the essence of the markets and i have attached a chart of what i have been doing hoping that you will correct any wrongs or encourage me to keep going . Wish you luck with your thread , Best regards .

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Welcome Kmalex. Your last LH on the top chart. should be one fractal to the right. On the bottom chart there is a missing LH to the right of the last LH. Remember that a new LH is only verified when price breaks below the last LL. (Vice verse with HH HL.) It takes practice then it gets easier. Thanks for posting charts.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thank you for your reply and correction (just to be sure,if we have more than one fractal befor the break do we take the highest fractal or the last one to be our last HL the chart i have attached shows what iam asking about ) I will practice some more and get back to you with more charts . BEST REGARDS

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes, when you get a break below the last LL you select the highest fractal between the LL and the place where it breaks, as the LH. This will be important when we start to use Fibonacci Ratios. In your chart above, you could have a pending order just below each LL and let the market take you into a breakout trade there. You can also try for an entry at the LH in each case, using the wick entry. The retrace level/wick entry is the best entry place. I will put some info together on that and it will hopefully answer questions that have been asked already. Questions that I have not got to yet.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
WAB Wanted to post this trade I took to see if I have the general idea. I got in a little late, but there ya go. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Looks good spyderman. If you are not on the screen all the time late trades happen, but if you know how the structure is forming you can still collect some pips. Now look for a WE at the anticipated LH. A break of the red DMTL will follow and a fractal will also form one or two bars after the wick does. The fractal stops are an easy way to trail a stop but we will do better with a a trailing stop X bars back. I have to go to Calgary tomorrow and will be off line all day. When I am back I will talk more about a second trailing stop strategy and some other things that will help locate the potential LH before it actually happens. I would say that I am about two thirds into the method now. A bit more to add then we can start to fine tune it. Good job. I promise it will get a lot better as one thing builds on the next.

Hey,wab I just wanted to clarify things out here with spyderman's chart the selected LL in the chart below haven't been broken and so we shouldn't mark that selected LH and therefore there will be no new HH until the break of the last(highest) HH so if that correct we can't take that entery so please correct me if i am wrong as i am still learning and these thing gets to my head , thanks.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Actually it did break the LL. By only 6/10 of a pip...but broke nonetheless.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I wouldn't consider it broken until candle close bellow

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Have to see what WAB says. A LL is just that...a lower low. If it was a lower close then it would be LC...

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Just closed a trade +23 pips. Total for a week + 116

--- 帖子 #121 ---
You can't determine LL unless previous fractal is broken, it can be done only by lower close Look at my last chart, before first green line, fractal is broken and it confirms LL

--- 帖子 #122 ---
You can look for a buy after HH (on your chart) is broken, untill that I would be looking only for a short! Here is one of my trades from this week

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I am having errors on setting up a higher Renko box size. MT4 just hangs. I have another Renko setup with box size 10 but its not the median Renko is the standard one. Ideas?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I was able to get the median renkos working on 10 pip boxes on M2 time frame. Size 8 time 6 seems to be working on all but NZD/USD it crashes mt4

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Kmalex. I suspect that you and spyderman have different data feeds. This is often a source of confusion in Forex when peo0ple compare charts. Each broker tends to have their own data feed and minor differences occur. I consider a break of a fractal as a break but when the fractals are very close in price levels is it time for caution. Soon the count will clarify itself. As you get to use the MACD more it will show that confused areas are always in count trends/corrections. Monocor, thanks for your trade charts. You have a good system going. If anything here makes it better please comment. Your input is great. I am going to talk about trailing a stop X bars, back. (Actually two bars back, plus a bit of room.) I am also going to introduce another indicator that works very well with Renko. Let's have a look at how a stop or an entry can be attempted: Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the diagram, the method frequently used for an entry, is to enter is when the Renko Bars have changed color. So if we have green bars going up and we get two red bars we close a trade or go short. That is method 2. As illustrated in the diagram. We know that the wick bar is a reversal signal, so entering at the bottom of the wick bar ( plus a pip ) gets into a trade a bar earlier. That is the equivalent of two green bars plus a pip. I like earlier entries as the little bit you gain often covers the spread etc. I can use LOC to trail a two bar stop, using its X bars back function. LOC will move the stop to the two bars back level as each new bar forms. (Plus a pip or whatever you select as an additional buffer.) I set the initial stop to equal to the number of pips that this would entail. So If I am using 4 block bars the initial stop would be set 4 + 4 + 1 pip = 9 pips back. You will need to adjust the initial stop according to the block size that you use and trail it manually, if you do not have a trade manager, such as LOC, that does it for you. Using the two block trailing stop versus a fractal trailing stop will be something that we can discuss. Each has its merits. The Fractal trailing system is very good at keeping you in longer term trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is an entry at a reversal on a wick bar. Using a fractal trailing approach, the stop is moved down from one LH to the next. Then you run into an area (inside the ellipse) where the MACD shows a counter trend and it becomes tricky to get the LL LH sequence correct. All of the up fractals are so close and then the last one, that is the actual LH shown, pokes just a little bit higher. How do we avoid a premature exit there? The solution is easy, just put a larger buffer on the fractal trailing stop. LOC will keep the stop any distance that you specify above the fractal. A 10 pips buffer keeps you in the trade, safely above the tight, counter-trend fractals, until the trend resumes. (MACD confirms when that happens.) The trailing fractal stop with a 10 pip buffer keeps you in for about 687 on that move. A larger buffer on the fractal trailing stop makes life easier. The X bars back trailing stop does not weather the choppy counter trend fractals but it will manage a trend trade nicely. Which one you use, depends on what you want to do. Note that both trailing stop methods will sacrifice some of the move, that is the nature of a trailing stop. Next I will introduce the last indicator that I use with Renko Charts. After that, some strategy and I think we will be pretty much ready to test, torture and improve the method. Maybe even develop an order ea that will take advantage of certain situations that occur in very fast markets. I will let it sit at that now and field any questions.

Just a note. I like to cite sources for indicators when I know where they originated. The MACD Candles Indicator can be found at http://cjatradingtools.com Thanks to CJA for sharing .

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Here was a bearish trade with an X bar stop. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The trade was trailed and closed by LOC, while I had a Sunday Afternoon nap. The sound of the Wick Arrow alerts woke me up in time to catch the bullish entry, though I was a tad late. The bullish trade is now in progress. Note that I also have pending orders in place at the fractals to catch any break out trades as well. The LL LH count prevails at this time unless that upper buy stop above the LH fractal is broken. (LL LH is not labeled on the chart.) The candles change color depending on the MACD. At this point we have bright green candles because the MACD is above zero. The black line on the chart is the close price line. It interacts nicely and we will use it in future charts, especially when I introduce the next indicator - which it interacts very nicely with. Just got stopped out by LOC, so I went short again. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will let LOC trail the stop and see how it goes. If it breaks the lower fractal, as mentioned I have a pending order there.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
today was a good trade with EJ, 2 orders, in total +80 pips.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
HEY ,WAB Is the divegence the reason of the bullish trade as the LL/LH count wasn't changed there .

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Yes the divergence was the reason. That and the opportunity to show how the X bar stop works. I think I will have to look at the USDJPY as monocor keeps nailing it. So far I have just been using the EURUSD for examples.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thanks for clearing that out and waiting for the upcoming indicator , also we want to sum all the things up as i am starting to get confused a little bit

--- 帖子 #132 ---
thanks for sharing this system wap i like renko bars very much just the best for scalping

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Anyone want to talk about the EU right now?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I like the EU reversal at 3532 and the AU at 8791. Just waiting on signals.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
A picture being worth a thousand words, here is a summary of the various signals and strategies so far. Attached Image (click to enlarge) First of all is the LL LH count. A LH is not confirmed until price breaks below the last LL. There is no indicator that will count the HH HL LL LH sequence properly … you have to learn how to do this yourself. Everything else is secondary to this. When price breaks above a confirmed LH a trend reversal has occurred. (See point 1 on the chart.) This is tells us to look for an opportunity to go long after a correction. The opportunity occurs at point 2 on the chart. A Wick Entry forms on the Median Renko Bar and a long trade is entered just above the wick bar. (WE) An additional entry signal is give as price breaks above the red De Mark Trend Line (DMTL) at 3. Then the DMTL re-sets itself and a further break above it signals another place to go long at 4. A break above the previous HH at point 5, is another long entry place. (This one was taken for a trade.) Each additional WE can be taken if the MACD/candle colors/ HH HL LL LH analysis, shows a suitable trend. Trends are identifiable, at a glance, by looking at the color of the candles. If the MACD is above zero and price is rising, the candles will be bright green. If the MACD is below zero and price is rising, the candles will be dull green. Bright Green candles mean a strong move is underway. Small counter-trend moves, with MACD above zero, will give dull red candles and may present an opportunity to add on new bullish WE trades. Proper trend analysis using HH HL LL LH must match what the MACD is telling us. The red and green arrows are alerts with a sound that is designed to draw your attention to the wick bars. They are produced by the MA crossover signal set to EMA 1 and 2. The circles mark fractals and the pivot points from which the DMTL is calculated. Blue Fractal arrows are shown on the chart but they are redundant –see above. Just use the DMTL circles for fractals. Divergence on the MACD and an understanding of the relationship between the MACD trends and counter trends and the corresponding candle color is necessary. The Close Price is displayed on the chart as a black line. “Chart on foreground,” is turned off in the chart properties to get this displayed properly with the Renko Bars. All of the above indicators are merely aids to help you see what is already there in the Renko Charts. If you can count the HH HL LL LH sequence, locate wick bars and fractals, then draw trend lines, you can do everything the indicators are designed to do. It takes practice and it is worth practicing because then you understand it better. The Signal Line is displayed as a red or a green line on the Renko Bars. I may or may not use all of the above indicators but I do like the Signal Line because it gives me the opportunity to gauge the strength of a move. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note how the black Close Line and the green Signal Line are far apart at the beginning of a move and they converge as the move matures. Then, the Close line drops below the Signal Line and the counter trend or reversal move starts. This works well in conjunction with the MACD and MACD color candles. The Signal Line Close Line relationship gives us a bit of an edge in anticipating changes in direction as they converge and cross and the momentum of a move weakens. (Drop a vertical line anytime the Close Line and Signal Line converge or cross and see how they all line up.) The Signal Line also changes color and that draws our eye to a possible entry along with a Wick Alert Arrow. When a bar pokes through the Signal Line we get another possible entry signal. At this point, I have presented a method for any and all to use, modify, debate, trade and so on. I have used 4 pip blocks on the EURUSD and I am open to trying other size blocks and other pairs. I look forward to seeing how this taken forward.

Wab Hello! First, congratulations for strategy and thank you for sharing knowledge with us. this is very precious and accompanied only today all your posts! forgive me for my English, I am Brazilian and I'm not used to writing in English. I would ask you to send the signal line indicator but can not find the Internet the same as you use! Big hug and thanks again!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Sorry, I thought I had posted it already. Here is the Signal Line Indicator ducka.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Wab Thanks for marking up that chart and the documentation..!! daveM

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thank so much, Wad! the configuration is the same that comes standard, right? I will soon post my contribution to the group!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Yes, the Signal Line settings are already set.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I would like to share with my friends this indicator that shows fractals in high and low lines in the exact places where the fractals arise. see how it works in the image:

--- 帖子 #142 ---
HEY WAB, FIRST, thank you for you continuous effort for helping and contribution . Secondly , i just want to know what is the best solution to handle cases like that (chart below) with choppy breaks or better than handling it how to avoid them if possible according to your experience

--- 帖子 #143 ---
even when we consider the highs and lows? this is your question, kmalex?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I am not sure what you mean because even when we determine high and low it will be difficult to determine what to do and i am asking to clarify things out as i am in learning process. To show what i meant the price breaks the HH so if we have a pending buy as wab suggested we are In for a buy then the market reverse and break through the last HL and supposedly we have a pending sell then, we have another reverse and break through the last HH and in for another buy. I don't know what part of my thinking is right and what's wrong so i 've asked hoping for advise and correction from those with experince so I DON'T understand your tone ????

--- 帖子 #145 ---
forgive me for my English. I believe we should look at how it behaves in relation to the MACD trend. beyond that, I'm using two simple moving average of 25 periods, the first in "low" and the second on "high". when the price crosses these averages there is a likely trend reversal. when the market is lateral, the averages behave differently. look in the picture:

--- 帖子 #146 ---
again, forgive me for English. I'm struggling .. hehe

--- 帖子 #147 ---
which currency pairs you trade with this strategy, WAB?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I had a couple of charts here that I realized were wrong, so I removed them. Does anyone else experience Median Renko charts that hang up and do not show the swings back and forth?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thanks for the Fractal support resistance indicator ducka. I have used it before and it is very useful. I filter choppy markets with the Alligator. When price is in a counter trend (dark red or dark green) the Alligator tends to be tangled. When price is moving strongly it will be bright green and above the Alligator or bright red and below the Alligator. The Alligator and the 5 34 5 MACD are designed to work together. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #150 ---
kmalex, On your chart there is actually a reversal that you can find like this: (I would label it to show you but my Renko Chart will not go back that far.) There is a LL between the last two HL and LL labels. If you locate that LL then there is a LH between your LL and LH labels. When price breaks above that you are back in synch with the bright green trend. Once the choppiness passes it is easy to get the HH HL LL LH count sorted out. Mean time when you see two HL fractals very close together in price or two LL fractals very close together in price you can be cautious. Take the most distant one until it sorts out. In regular charts I go to a higher time frame to solve the choppiness and sort out my HH HL LL LH count. Larger blocks may help. Another thing to consider is that bright green is trending and dark red shows counter trends. Because it is above zero on the MACD the market it trending up overall, even if it it does counter trend temporarily and throw a reversal pattern in there. The HH HL LL LH sequence is tricky at times like that and the MACD in particular helps sort it out. I hope that helps. As you run into that situation again and again,you will recognize it and get good at dealing with it. HH HL LL LH does not lie to us, but we have to listen to it carefully or miss what it is telling us.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks wab for responding and clearing things out . I didn't understood your explanation about the missing LL in the chart i have posted so if you could clear it more or when your renko chart is fixed attach a picture (sorry for bothering you ) . And to sum things out about the choppy market we can/better to : 1-Avoid trading when fractals are very close together in price 2-caution with Breaking the CRL when macd is dull Red/Green as it may be just a pullback 3-A look with a larger block size is preferred to avoid such situation Sorry for repeating what you have just said but i just wanted to make sure i get things right before going ahead and is the alligator setting is default .

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi kmalex. If anyone has a good set of instructions on how to get more M1 data please post it. Thanks. Sorry the explanation doesn’t make sense. My data only scrolls back so far and I could not get back far enough to bring up that part of the chart to show you what I was trying to describe. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let’s move on to a similar situation that is current. Look at the area in the ellipse on the chart. The HH HL count gets difficult to sort out there. I have shown the count with hh? and hl? If you look at the MACD in this area you see that it is in a counter trend. This, combined with very close prices for the hh? hh? and hl? hl? Fractals makes it difficult to do our price analysis. Eventually it becomes clear and we change the last hh? To a HH. It is confusing at first and only gets easier with practice. This particular part of the sequence is what is referred to as a fourth wave in Elliott Wave terms and most losses occur in a fourth wave. Another way to look at that is if you cannot determine the HH HL LL LH count you are likely in a fourth wave and need to stand aside until the count becomes clear again. I have put the Alligator (default settings) on the chart to show how it works. In Impulse, or trend moves, price stays well clear of the Alligator - above it in a bull move. The correction or count trend dips back into the Alligator. This corresponds exactly with the 5 34 5 MACD. Each dip gets a little deeper and then we get a trend reversal as the MACD goes below zero. It does not do it without a fight. The price may cross the Alligator and the MACD may cross zero then pull back up for a re-test, which is possibly the situation we have here. I added a ? to show the idea of the re-test. Of course if goes higher than the last HH … we have to work with that. We can’t predict the future we just try to understand where we are in the present. Our last Green Wick Arrow may be a new HL or the first LL if price rallies then breaks below it. A new bright red bar here will signal a down trend. A new red WE, somewhere around the ? would also be a good short entry that I would take. Finally I want to point out the last down fractal. I extended a violet line to the right from it and labeled that line as the BW (Bill Williams) fractal. This is the first fractal which is broken by a lower price and it is also below the Red Alligator line when it is broken. I will not go into the BW fractal at this point because we have a lot going on here. Watch for it at a future time. When it shows up it is a good indicator of a trend change. I will explain it in due course. Again, if anyone has a good set of instructions on how to get more M1 data please post it. My M1 data goes back to Nov 27th any ideas on how to get more?

Please help me.. I have installed the RenkoLiveChart_Betterv3.301_fxkred.ex4 and it is shown in the custom indicator of Navigator window but unfortunately it won't show up into the chart when i drag it to the chart. I saw the tab Journal which says " Expert 'RenkoLiveChart_Betterv3.301_fxkred' is not custom indicator and will be removed". Anybody has the same problem with me? How to solve it. thanks

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hello Brother, actually you put this renko builder in wrong folder, RenkoLiveChart_Betterv3.301_fxkred.ex4 is EA type of renko builder and not custom indicator, so you must put 'her' in MT4/Expert folder instead of MT4/Expert/Indicator, then activate her just like you use an EA.. Hope it help and happy trading.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi My Friend Wab, I always following your thread with big interest since i'm also renko lover.. About maximize your M1 source data for offline renko chart, do you already change your Tools/Option/Chart for maxbars in history and maxbars in chart ?, also do you use real account for your renko source data ?, if yes then your data will limited to your opening account date. but if you use demo then you can get maximum M1 source data. You can also download historical data from other source to your real account history folder, but this will ruin your original broker tick data, and sometime make 'mismatch' error when you use strategy tester. And, also little suggestion to all of you, most of renko chart builders program with EA, Indicator, or script type, that build with MT4 build 509 compiler, will not work with new MT4 update. even if you have mq4 version, so better not update your MT4 for a while, until some one can change the program structure to create offline chart with the new set of program code from metaquotes, for myself, it is really painful to change hundred of my personal indicators,script and EA.. Hope it help and happy trading..Brickers MTH

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Wab hello, thanks for listening! I have a question at this time. I'm checking some peers and emerged an intriguing moment in GOLD. Ps:. GOLD is a metal that moves and behaves very well with the Renko chart. the image is intuitive, but it would be better to wait for the definition of the trend or trend between LH and LL would enter into a trade? MACD is also in agreement, but I think it would be a risky operation ... what would you tell me?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks for the help kmalex and Kiads. This is how it is supposed to work. We help each other out and it leads to a better world for all of us. I upped the number of candles to 10,000 and I will see if I can get back to the area that you had a question about when I get a chance to do so. Meantime, here is how the chart that I was following last night worked out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I left LOC to manage my trade and it did so nicely, with 16.4 pips. The MACD continued to give some little counter trend information then it decided to go above zero and a combination, or any of the WE, DMTL breaks and Fractal breaks all would have been good entries. Price finally broke above four fractals, confirming a trend reversal. I wasn't at my computer to take any of them, so it is all academic at this point. If I was on line, I would have had a nice run of 59 pips from the first WE. Here is the same chart with the Alligator and the BW fractal. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The bullish BW fractal, is the first fractal which has its price broken above the red Alligator line. (If we had a bearish BW fractal it would be the first fractal to have it price broken below the red Alligator line.) Note how the trend, once again, sees price stay well out of and above the Alligator which opens wide. When price swings back into the Alligator we get a bounce up for another bright green, then MACD divergence and a break below the Alligator tells us it is done.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
kmalex, regards post 142. Your M1 data suggestion worked ... thank you. I was therefore able to scroll back to the area where you had your question about the HH HL LL LH count. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Following our rules for HH HL LL LH there is a reversal inside the ellipse. In Elliott Wave Counting that area is a wave four, always an area of confusion, whipsaws and false signals. The Alligator (Not shown on the chart) closes up there and clear trends do not happen. The 5 34 5 MACD is also called the Elliott Wave oscillator and it helps to identify wave four. The highest or (lowest level of the MACD is usually followed by a small divergence. This is shown in red on the chart. This divergence marks the end of the strongest move (Wave three.) The MACD then heads towards zero, usually touching or penetrating the zero level to confirm a wave four. (In this example it did not get to zero but it usually does at least go down that far.) A wave five impulse follows but it is mostly weaker than the previous wave three impulse wave. A larger divergence (black) is the 3, 4, 5 Elliott Wave divergence. Now I really hoped to avoid detailed Elliott Wave stuff here. So let's not worry about that too much and just focus on the MACD and the brick colors. When the MACD is above zero, we only want to take long, impulse trades, preferably with green bricks. If we know the HH HL LL LH count, so much the better. If we have a confused area, check the MACD and see if it is a counter trend /correction and consider taking entries in the direction of the trend only or just stay out until it becomes more clear. Some people say that an entry at the third fractal (that would be the LL, Wick Entry, just above the "four" label) is a good place to enter. If you can keep all of that in you mind and act on it, then you are really good. You can see how the price finally broke above the LH at green line, the right edge of the ellipse, and resumed the HH HL count until it reversed again below the last HL. I know this is complex to explain and maybe a lot of what I have explained here is not necessary. The Elliott Trader in me gets loose once in a while. Anyhow if you can be aware that the MACD peaks, diverges a bit, then heads for zero that is the area to be cautious. Knowing why is not really necessary. If you like to know why, then I refer you to Bill Williams books on Trading Chaos. ********************************************************************************************* ducka regards post 159. I cant put up a Renko gold chart as the markets are closed. I don't follow gold as much as I should, given that I work with it every day. I stocked up a long time ago and I am glad that I did. The last LH is correctly identified. You can trade using the MACD and keep an eye on that LH. You are correct thinking that the LL label is not verified until price breaks below its fractal. Knowing that, you have a range between the LH an the potential LL to work in. If price moves past either of those there is a trend change. Watch the DMTL for any breaks. Price is in the tight end of a triangle and will break out soon. Check the H4 gold chart Alligator. Very strong move under way. Try a HH HL LL LH analysis on the daily gold chart and see what is happening. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The problem you will have to solve is how do the Renko Bricks and the daily chart relate to each other. Just taking long trades may be the solution. Also look at the weekly gold chart and see what it is saying.

We may be running into some problems with a new MT4 upgrade on Feb 3rd. Some issues may arise and I have found out a bit of information here: http://forex.ovo.cz/en/index.php?sub...635037&amp;ucat=1&amp; I have also been looking at the various Renko options available at that web site and wonder if anyone has tried any of the experts available there. I particularly like the option of having various time frames besides M1 available in the chart where the Renko Ea runs. Have a look at the video for the same link above at you tube. Inserted Video Anyone tried this? Any comments?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi Wab, First congratulation for your thread ! I used renko chart intensively in the past. you do not need to wait until the market opens to build a renko offline chart. just do a backtest with renko EA in TF M1 (untick visual) , use each tick , choose date from xxx to today. set your renko EA options and start BT. when BT is finished, open your offline chart and that's all regards and sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi My Friend Wab, Ovo is experienced coder, especially with any type of MT4 offline charts builder. New MT4 build release, will harm all of offline chart builder EA/Indicators/Script. created with build 509 compiler or older, they change the command code for read/write process of history file that needed to build offline chart. So we must re-write the code entirely. I believe that the new release still bring a lot of bugs and will keep changing as usual for MT4..lol. BTW you can visit my thread here in platform tech: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=454060 you will find indicator type of renko chart builder, similar with ovo. Hope it help and happy week end.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thank you pcca- matrix and Kiads for the help. I have looked over the indicator based Renko from Ovo and like what I see so far. I will also have a look at yours Kiads. I have used FX Reds script based off line because I like the Median Renko. I am always amazed at how many people on ff offer so much to others. You guys are great! With the new update looming, I hope that we are able to carry on without too many issues. I guess that we will know soon enough. This weekend I have played with larger bricks and the method we have evolving here seems to work just as well, if not better. Generally I like to test ideas in shorter time frames and fine-tune them, then trade longer time frames. The same will apply here. Four pip bricks are good to get action and test ideas and teach with. Larger bricks for the real work.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
When I used renko I personally puts brick of 15 , my adpative MA and 2 oscillator just to confirm the trends, and this is what it gives Attached Image (click to enlarge) I just handed quickly the graph because I no longer use renko. I follow your thread carefully, your approach seems interesting. regards

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Just an update. I am waiting to see how the Feb 3rd upgrade to MT4 works out. Meantime, I suggest any Renko Fans read Kiad's material (link in post 166.) Really good stuff there. After the update, I will add a useful indicator that gives visual cues to what we have already discussed above. Then I will suggest some additional strategies that enhance it all. So, until we have a new Renko system to work, with, stay well.

Hi Ducka. I can't do much just now as I am doing jewelry stuff. Later tonight I will make some suggestions in regards to different stop loss strategies and try and post some chart examples . Generally entering on the red or green WE arrows is good if you are in synch with the MACD and the HH HL LL LH trend.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I believe the problem has been the size of the Renko I'm using ... configured for 10 pips per Renko. You usually operate during the opening of the London market? may be stronger than for movements to be interesting to use more pips per renko, however, when the market is less open markets, reduce the size of renkos. I'm talking nonsense? =)

Some thoughts / examples on entries and stops: Always know the HH HL LL LH sequence as best as you can. Always see how that relates to the 5 34 5 MACD. Always identify the potential CRL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) When the MACD is quite deep you might consider a counter trend trade. This is shown by the risky label on the MACD. The CRL is not too far away and a break of that means the trend is reversing so you have to judge this. Experience helps. Once the CRL is broken it will pull back and form a WE. This is the safe entry. It is safe because the trend has reversed and you are getting in on wave two or wave B of the Elliott Wave . The previous entry on the green WE alert is not as risky as the first WE because the MACD is going above zero. Now we can enter at each green WE or as the price breaks above the recent HH fractals. Essentially entering on breakouts and HL, green WE, pullbacks. Stops can be close to the HL pullbacks and you will get some good trades before the price stops you out. As the MACD gets higher you will be wise not to add positions. Now, how long you will stay in a trend depends on how well you read the MACD. It will diverge and head back to zero or lower and give you places to locate stops. I will explain that in a later post. Meanwhile. if you keep a large buffer on the stops below the HL, green WE, fractals, you will weather the corrections and stay in the trend for a long while.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Before I go further, I should mention the new indicator that I have added to draw attention to the MACD trends. The MACD that we are using is a 5 34 5 exponential one so you may find the occasional discrepancy. Set the MACD SMA alerts V4 to 5 34 5 and the line style to 2. and you will have a vertical dotted (red stay short or blue stay long) line on the chart. Indicator and new template are both attached.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
What exactly is the 5 34 5 MACD and what does it show us? I believe most people don't have a clue how a MACD works or what a MACD is. Renko really helps clear that up quickly. In the chart I have placed a 1MA of the high and a 1MA of the low and then I removed the Renko bricks. This gives us a black channel that outlines the bricks. The CRL level is shown. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next I have added one of the MACD moving averages. The 5 EMA of the close is a red line. Note how it stays inside the Renko Channel. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now I have added the other moving average of the MACD, the 34 EMA of the close is the green line. Note the places where the red line dips below the green one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also notice the places where the black Renko Channel has dipped below the green 34 EMA. Now place our Renko bricks back on the chart and also examine the MACD a bit. We have a long term divergence and a short term one as well. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Can you see the good places to have placed your stops in a long term trade? The last Renko Channel dip has been broken and a divergence tells us to step aside now. Look at how the MACD tells you where those good stop loss places are. Now when we go back to our full chart display we have a pretty good idea of what the 5 34 5 MACD does for us. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The 5 34 5 MACD is designed to match the Elliott Waves that are in the chart. We have a system that allows us to be aware of the HH HL LL LH count, the fractal breakouts, the Wick Entries and also the DMTL breakouts. All good potential places to enter trades. We don't need to know too much about Elliott Wave to use this but I do urge anyone really interested to read Bill Williams books to further their understanding of how the 5 34 5 MACD and the Alligator and the Elliott Wave all work together. We can use a variety of trailing stops. (If you want to use LOC you have to purchase a copy to trail the stops for you.) You can scalp between WE alerts or try for long term trades suing the dips as above until you hit a MACD Divergence. If you want to try larger bricks you can use the same strategy to weather small brick corrections. Using a large brick and a small brick chart side by side is very powerful too. (We will discuss that later.) Reading the MACD and getting the HH HL LL LH count takes practice then it becomes more clear.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
If you like pretty charts. Here is another little addition to make the MACD easier to see. The MA ribbon filled Alerts colors in the space between the EMA 5 and the EMA 34 moving averages. It also makes general Buy and Sell recommendations on the bottom right. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I used bigger blocks here, the block size does not affect the analysis, but it does result in a lot less signals to worry about and bigger trades that carry on for longer periods of time. All settings are in the ffrenkoribbon template, which assumes you have all of the previous indicators discussed so far, already installed.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Wab, you're the best, man! I'm linking one thing to another now! but I would ask to explain about the new indicator MACD SMA alerts ... how he could use to further refine the entries? big hug and thank you

--- 帖子 #178 ---
The MACD alerts are the dotted vertical lines that show where the trend or counter trend changes occur according to the MACD. Check the MACD to see where they come from as it changes form green to red and so on. A general rule would be, if the vertical line is blue only consider long trade the right of it. If you have had a green Wick Alert and you enter long and a blue MACD alert follows that is a confirmation. Often the Wick alert will happen just before or even on the same brick as the MACD alert occurs. The opposite of course, red Wick Alert arrow and red dotted vertical MACD alert line for bearish trades. Once we get the new Renko up and running - after the MT4 upgrade -I will start posting charts as they evolve.

Good afternoon, my friends! What would be the best time to work with Renko charts? anyone ever think of that? My question is about the time that the market responds better to the chart Renko ...

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Well it is Feb 3rd and my MT4 has not forced an update yet. I started some 16 pip brick trades last Friday and left them on for a while. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As for the best time to trade? I think the Renko approach makes timing trades different... you can't just check every hour, or every 5 minutes because it is price that is drawing the bars, not time. The trade above stretched over four days, counting the weekend. If you are using smaller bricks then you can of course be in and out a lot more quickly. I live in the MST time zone and that makes it difficult to trade the London markets, which open about 2:a.m. my time. I find with the Japanese open, at 5:00 p.m. my time there is lot to trade with smaller bricks. 4 pip bricks are fast enough and make some good moves. I would appreciate anyone else jumping in here with advice for ducka. Now where is that MT4 upgrade?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I understand, Wab! but I realize that most of the good moves happen during the morning in Brazil ... London in my time zone opens at 4h and goes until 13h and where it all goes! Could you tell me which pair operated in this strategy? thank you very much!!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Wab, What's your alligator settings. OOTB?

Hello Spyderman! the settings are standard, just add the chart...

eurix, regarding post 189-- its unclear which Renko indicator you are using in the chart.

Not that I have any real knowledge but I have just had an email from COMPASSFX warning me not to upgrade to the new 600 MT4.

Wab hello! you made ​​four entries in this operation, ok? I realize that the last one did when útimo HL was broken, confirming the trend reversal. but what intrigues me is what led him to make the first three entries .... the chart before the first entry seems to be coming from a low corrected and fell again. what made ​​you get into this operation? somehow identified the correct wave? I'm learning a lot from your sharing! thank you

--- 帖子 #194 ---
where did I find all thos indi expl DDS.. etx reg

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hello ducka. You have a very sharp eye to spot that. I used a bit if wave counting and then some Fibonacci. The overall high was the start of an EW sequence and I entered at what would be wave 2, or wave B up. I used Fibonacci to pick the entry levels. I will explain it all in a chart soon. Tonight, I worked on refining a possible strategy that I think will make Renko scalping easier to do. Some nice trades, but only about 60% profitable so far. It will be -32 tomorrow morning. I would be about 20 degrees warmer sitting in a deep freeze. Good weather for trading Forex.

Hi wab how are you doing . i have read about the new changes in MT4 but i am still using your renko median indicator you have posted but there is a new directory to place the indicator and expert that's what i have done and it seems to be working i hope it will help , Attached Image (click to enlarge) then you put your indicator ,script and Expert in MQL4/Experts MQL4/Indicators MQL4/Scripts Attached Image then restart your platform and i think it will work .

Hah! I accidentally posted this on the MT4 New build 600 is released thread. Here we go: Go to File Open Data Folder to do this as in the video above. Put the RenkoMeanLiveChart Indi MT45.mq4 in the indicators folder. The other Indicators are also put in the new MT4 600 indicators folder as shown on the video. The template goes in the Temple folder, as shown on the video. Restart MT4 build 600. Open a (M1) chart and drop the RenkoMeanLiveChart Indi MT45.mq4 indicator on the chart. Open the indicator to select the Brick size etc. Open the offline chart as prompted by the RenkoMeanLiveChart Indi MT45.mq4 indicator. Then the MT4600renkotemplate is applied to the offline chart. It should look like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We are back in business. I have lost some indicators that I really like and some other things no longer work, but onwards and upwards. (Thanks to Jeff Glenellis for the helpful video.)

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Wab Hello! I am somewhat confused because my systems updated but did not need to do any of these settings! I hope not to have problems later! going back to trades!

--- 帖子 #207 ---
A few posts back (before the new build distracted us) ducka asked about some entries that I took. To answer his question I will use a chart and show how I combine Fibonacci with the HH HL LL LH count. When the trend changes direction, that gives a chance to catch a third wave of some degree. What is happening at a change in trend, is also known as a 1, 2, 3 trade or an A, B, C, D trade. In Elliott Wave, this would generally be a new 1,2 waiting for a 3 or a new A ,B, waiting for a C. All of the labels used in different ways makes for a lot of confusion. The wave counting, 1,2,3 and A, B, C, D stuff is nice if you understand it, but not essential. Let's look at the chart and relate this to HH HL LL LH. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the left we start off with HH HL count and the last HL level is broken as price drops. Ideally, I will draw a Fib from the last HH to the first LL if I can figure out where the LL is. A good rule of thumb is draw the Fib from the last HH to the first down fractal that forms below the last HL and then adjust, if necessary, it as the LL LH picture becomes clear. Of course we don't know where the LH will form, but it will form at or near a Fibonacci level, generally between 61.8 and 78.6.. This is the Fib Retrace Sweet Spot. I have placed an ellipse over it and very often this is where the next Wick Entry sell signal occurs. Often, that is all you have to do to find a good entry after a reversal in the trend. However, markets are nothing if they are not fickle. Our next chart is a continuation of the above one and shows how we have to dance with the evolving LL LH until it becomes clear. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now we can see how each of the Fib Retrace levels provides a place to be alert for WE trades. Just look at how those WE and Fibonacci levels are right on the mark! I am so confident with this that I can place pending or limit orders at the Fib levels. If price doesn't retrace to one or more of those levels, no harm done. My stop stays just above the last HH and I can let entries run with a minimum target at the 61.8 level, shown below the 0.0 Fib level. Of course there is also the break out trade as the price moves below the 0.0 Fib , which is of course also the LL level. A note on the MT4 Fibonacci tool. If you examine how I use Fibonacci, I am interested in the retrace levels from LL all that way back to the last HH. A 100% retrace means I have to have the 100% label at the last HH. A 61.8% retrace has to follow this logic and therefore level of 0.0 is where I break into a new wave. My 61.8 or 161.8 targets are therefore actually entered into the Fibo properties as negative values ; -0.618 and -1.618. All this takes practice and as I said above, when you get confident with your HH HL LL LH and draw the Fibs on the trend changes, you get very confident that the WE will form at Fib retrace levels. There are other ways to use the Fibs that we will explore later. For those of you who want to set your Fibonacci Tool to match mine, here are the settings that I use. 0.0 0.236 0.382 0.5 0.618 0.786 0.86 1.0 1.618 -0.18 -0.27 -0.618 -1 -1.618 -2.0 -2.618 -4.235 And, here is how you can get the levels and prices to show on the chart. Click on Fibo Properties and set the levels like this for each value. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #208 ---
you are a true master, Wab! my eyes are open enough to Fib after this explanation! thank you very much, I'll keep practicing and watching you ...

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Wab hello! I will bother you again ... haha when the amount of retraction in fibo is below 50, you consider the input or remains out of operation? some analyzes showed me retractions in 38.2 and not know if it's an interesting value to consider the input as good! thanks again master!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
ducka have a look at any info on the Elliott Wave Oscillator. (Same as the 5, 34, 5 MACD.) Some pairs (GBPUSD for example) will favor a 50% retrace on wave two. Others, the sweet spot is at 61.8 to 78.6%. Here is a PDF that explains how to count the waves fairly well in Elliott terms. The HH HL LL LH works with this as well. http://www.esignal.com/support/advan...manual_ch7.pdf

--- 帖子 #211 ---
that excellent tips, Wab! quite interesting and enlightening ... then it would be interesting to wait for the pattern that is formed in wave 4 to wave 5 (divergence) and to monitor the emergence of wave 3? I believe the most obvious sign that the trend will change sign is the same pattern of divergence! thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Wab Thank you for starting this thread, your insights into Elliot wave and Fibonacci are eye opening to me. I am very much indebted to you for lifting the veil. This new build is a bitch and I hope that it doesn't affect your thread inputs to much. Having wakened to a new dawn I am hungry for morsels. All the very best to you

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yes indeed, the new build is a pain. I am sure it will soon settle down and we can get back to trading instead of trying to get our MT4 working.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi Wab, your strategy is awesome, Can you attach the OCL fractal trailing stop EA here because i like it to use for for moveing Stop loss to maximize my profit. ALso, For the renko chart new build 600, when we use 1min chart for EUR/USD, we dont need to hold the HOME button to get the data right? Thank you

--- 帖子 #215 ---
The LOC trailing stop is not mine to attach. It is a commercial product, well worth the price in my opinion. I am not an affiliate, just a satisfied customer. (I hope that is not considered commercial content.) I apologize for the lack of posts. I have had a lot of issues to sort out with the new 600+ builds, along with other things requiring lots of my time. I hope to get back to this soon. Patience is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I will be getting the LOC tool it is well worth it... I am using attached Renko builder modified by Mladen

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Thanks for that Blaiserboy. I have been using Kiads new Renko accelerator offline chart. It doesn't work on build 610 and I think he is working on yet another fix. It will be a while before the MT4 upgrade is more user friendly. I have also been working on a trade manager for Renko, but that all got messed up and requires a lot of sorting out.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Mladen and Mr Tools are really good about trying to keep us running, they have only so much time in a day and they are swamped at this time. Good people.!! I have been using the Hopwood trade manager, I guess I am used to it. Once the Mt4 Transition is complete, I will attempt an EA for Renko, I am hoping that we can backtest easily as it becomes like Mt5 This could be an exciting future with Mt4.

Hello, Netpicks sent me a free Renko system the other day. Possibly because it no longer works with the Metatrader platform upgrade! What is interesting about their Renko system indicators is that Heiken Aishi has been attached to the Renko bars. Here is a link to the webpage that has the downloads and instructional videos. http://forexchanneltrading.com/?page_id=163 I cannot post the indicators myself as the system is stating that I have reached my up load quota with only two attachments. Regards. If anyone would like me to post them, in mq4 format, I can do this one or two attachments at a time.

Hey Wab, nice Thread! I am not through all the Posts but as far as I can see, its all about PA without lagging or repainting indicators. I am a part time trader. Yes, I need to go to work as well So...often when I am infront of my computer I missed nice entry signals. I am wondering if we could make an EA out of this - at least for alerts... looking forward to set up my charts

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I have been experimenting with a way to have an ea open trades and then have LOC manage them. Stay tuned.

I placed a sell limit order right @ broken trendline. SL is above the upper fractal. I hope that trade works out, as I am new to that system.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I have an idea that this trade did not work for you as the pair climbed after you made your entry. I would like to suggest that before you pull the trigger on an entry that you determine all of the reasons to make the trade and also.......... reasons to not make the trade. You can look back through the thread to see the reasons, this will be a terrific exercise for you as it is going to teach you about entries and exits. I suggest that you continue to mark up charts and put your thinking on them, you do not have to post them, just keep them in a folder for future reference, or post them with a couple questions and all the readers can benefit. I also suggest that you prepare yourself by marking support and resistance on some higher time frame charts so that you can get an idea as to where price may bounce or sit in a range. I hope that helps a bit.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
One thing that works Apfelsaft is to only go long when the MACD is above zero and only short when MACD is below zero. The exception being when a divergence occurs.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
GBPJPY I like the Bill Williams approach even though it is old fashioned to some... I am old fashioned LOL I find this chart quite effective and simple and also lucrative. I add positions at the fractals, no complex entries, when price crosses a fractal I add. This is trend following, I have to do no special work, no lines to be drawn, I just have to observe. I do keep a lot of daily charts open and do a bit of analysis on each one so I have an idea as to what may be coming, but for trading I use this and similar. Depending on my 'mood' I will exit a retrace based on the awesome oscillator, the red line and whatever else may come to mind at the time. I like to see the slope of the alligator a bit more steep than this chart shows. reflect momentum and volatility. I have a second simple chart that I use, I trade according to the trend line and the Hama, I use the timing indicator to detect the end of a move approaching(not for entry) Whatever we use, it has to 'talk' to us and once we have one that speaks loudly, then that is the one to use. There ios no perfect chart except for the one that talks to us the loudest at the time and that can vary from week to week. Have a great day, everyone.!!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hello Blaiserboy, thanks for your input. My Trade did not work out your right. I posted my chart to early. The Idea was to discuss the Entry. what was your entry point on the first chart? Thanks also to you wab.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Wab, do you place sell/buy stop orders @ significant levels? like Breakout point DTL, SR,...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I will defer to Wab to reply to your question re entry point...... he has some interesting views that may be much more beneficial than what I would say. Perhaps look back in the thread also as he has some neat tools that he applies.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thanks Blaiserboy. An honor to be deferred to by yourself. Apfelsaft, before you have any success with indicators in my opinion, you need to be able to read the bare chart itself. Learn to identify the support and resistance areas. Once you master this you will throw away most of the indicators as you will no longer need them. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the chart, I have identified waves, steps, zigzags, whatever you chose to call them. I have labelled them HH HL LL LH accordingly. Each label is on a Fractal. You have to master this yourself. There is no indicator that does it properly in MT4. (At least none that I have found anyway.) Once you can do this you will know more about a chart than any of the indicators can tell you. Every single chart has this structure and every single trend ends like this. Once you can spot the structure and identify the components of it, you can find great entries like the ones above and trail your stop down fractal by fractal. You can study Elliott Wave for years and try thousands of indicators and it will not put you very far past this. Having said that, I use a bare minimum indicators. I like the De Mark Trend lines because it identifies the fractals and also draws the current trend lines correctly. It is an indicator that helps identify or confirm structure that I can already see myself. Makes me feel good when it does what I have already anticipated. I use the 5 34 5 MACD for a variety of reasons: The main one is again that it identifies wave structure when you learn how to read it. (That gets into Elliott Wave and Fibonacci and the Alligator and so on. Interesting stuff but all built on HH HL LL LH.) The HH HL LL LH and trend lines alone is most of a very good system of trading. Once I understand that I found that additional indicators that are actually useful are few and far between. I constantly try new things but the essence of what I believe is useful in charting is in the chart above.

Kiads and Wab have studied trading for more than a few weeks even though they are both only in their late teens... and they spend their time mentoring us young guys, hopefully to impart some of what they have learned. Between them they know a lot of stuff. 1.Higher Highs and Lower highs... the first entry after a trend change is after the lower high. I feel it is most important that we trade with trend, I know others will differ. As Wab pointed out. learn this technique until it comes naturally. 2. Trend following is as simple as a moving average. Put a 17 ma on a renko chart and you will have something that indicates trend. An entry has to follow that line and the line has to have a good slope. 'Without slope, there is no hope'. 3. A nice thing that I use is a 30 ema and a 50 ema. if price is near those two or between them.... trade something else I have mentioned three moving averages and reaffirmed the HH LH HL LL, there is not much more you need to trade Renko.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thank you Wab &amp; Blaiserboy for your advice! I really appreciate your efforts! Amazing chart setups and explanations! Its not easy to read the chart correctly... What do you think is the "best" renko bar size for part time trading? I guess for daytrafing its between 5-10 pips

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Wab is a price action trader and he seems to like the faster charts as he is quite skilled at reading them. I prefer them to be a little slower, I use 15 or 20 pips.... just my preference. Best to use a larger block size to start and get used to and then reduce it as you gain confidence. You have to build a chart that 'talks' to you loud and clear... easier to use larger blocks to start. Wab will probably have a couple ideas for you also. Keep in mind that nothing is written in stone, your screen time and experience will give you solutions that may vary from week to week. Notice the Macd in Wab's chart...... that one indicator will tell you so much....

--- 帖子 #244 ---
When I trade regular charts, I prefer to use H4 or even daily. The trades are slow moving and there is no hurry to jump in. Having said that, I do a lot of research in lower time frames because you can see how things work, or don't work more quickly. I think it is the same in Renko. Four pip bricks move fast enough that you can test out your ideas and gain experience. What is important is to have a system that you own. It must be something that you understand as well as you can and have as much confidence in as you can. That only comes with lots and lots of practice, research and so on. If you are reading stuff here and on other threads, you will gather enough ideas and fit them together in a way that suites you and works for you. I know a lady, who drives from the next town (no bank there) several times a week and moves her money back and forth between a Canadian Dollar account and a U.S. Dollar account. That is how she trades Forex. No leverage, no charts, just what she sees on the news. She makes close to a 100 K a year, just doing that. Her daughter asked me to show her mother how charting works and her mother just laughed at the whole idea. She understands what she is doing and is good at it. I know another old fellow (that is getting to be a term I can use less and less often) who trades stocks every day. He just watches the business News Network and is very successful. He has made a million twice. He defies my logical thinking processes but he is amazingly successful. I like charts. I have studied charts for along time, especially Elliott Wave and Bill Williams' ideas. That is what makes sense to me. I look at methods other people use and if it works for them, that is perfect. My interest in Renko has been more to find a short-term method that will compliment the long term ones that I already use. No matter what time frame I work in, the MACD or the AO and AC and the Alligator are the best in my opinion. With Renko the Heiken Ashi Smoothed is also amazing. As Blaiserboy says, work at it until the charts are talking to you, then be patient and wait until they do so clearly. Patience is the most important thing. We cannot take money from the market until it clearly offers it to us. I have been working on an idea that will perhaps help a lot with the box size issue. I will start showing some charts on that soon. As yet, I do not have firm conclusions but I am sure some of the expertise here will help out.

Build 625 has messed up a whole lot of good things again. If your indicators quit working check the build number. MT4 is really starting to be so improved that hardly anyone will be able to use it anymore.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Have you a Renko indicator for new build?

One is attached and you can also look at Kiads Arts thread on the first post for some very interesting varieties of Renko and the indicator that generates them. Have fun.

On the chart a break of a fractal is identified as a trend reversal. I thought it was the break of a LH/HL? (Chart is first chart of post #237)

If you label your chart with the Brick Size that would help me match the chart. I did a 5 pip brick median Renko chart and it shows some useful content so I went ahead and used it to somewhat answer your question. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You will see that there are usually sub waves inside the larger HH HL LL LH waves that we look for. (Sometimes we cannot see then but they exist between every pair fractals. When you go to a lower time frame they are always there.) Between the top HH and the first LL there are in fact five sub waves formed between the fractals. The fifth one is the one that confirms a reversal in trend as it is below the last HL. However the blue De Mark trend line was broken a lot earlier and it is a good early warning of a potential trend reversal. Each break of the blue De Mark Trend lines is a useful signal. The overall trend is down until we get a reversal pattern -where that last LH is broken after a De Mark line is broken The AO or a MACD gives you the direction to trade until a divergence cautions you to expect a trend reversal. If the AO is above zero take long trades. If it is below zero take short trades. If the AO shows divergence watch the De Mark trend lines and the HH HL LL LH for a reversal.

Hello fellow Renko Fans. I have been getting some fresh interest in this topic from various people and I will start posting again in a day or two. The upgrade to version 600 plus derailed many things but that is in the past now and many of the issues have been solved. Stay tuned and we can take the Renko studies forward. I have been experimenting a lot with auto systems and perhaps we can find some good strategies there. Thanks to those of you that have sent me private messages of encouragement.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Interesting to hear from you again. I am still subscribed to your thread. Looking forward.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Reboot of Animal Farm. It is a good idea to read over the thread, prior to this post, as there is a lot of good information in it. Many questions have already been asked and answered and it saves everyone time if you come to the discussion already informed. When MT4 began all of the upgrades to version 600 + a lot of Renko things that I was using stopped working. It took a lot of effort to get back on track and each upgrade offered new challenges. Many of the Renko off-line generators became non-functional or unreliable. I eventually started using a commercial Renko Chart generator (Free demo at forex ovo) and found a more stable Renko Chart generator to work with. Currently I am not up on the latest, free, Renko off-line chart generators. If anyone has a good one that they can share, I am open to using it here, so that we have consistent charts to discuss. It must show the wicks. Wicks are important. When it comes to charts: In a rising market they form a series of higher highs and higher lows. This eventually reverses to form a series of lower lows and lower highs in a falling market. A trader has to be able to recognize this and know how to take advantage of it. Price action alone tells us where the trend really is, right here and now. To me, Indicators either lag or require interpretation, which differs from person to person. Even the best of indicators are often wrong and you dont know until after the fact. If you have an indicator that you really like, give it this test. Cover up the price data and just trade the indicator all on its own. It is an interesting experiment. Some indicators are useful as they help identify structure and momentum in a chart, but again subjective interpretation is required. Even price, the ultimate indicator in my opinion, requires interpretation. The Elliott Wave is the most complex of the price interpretation methods and I have spent countless hours on Elliott Wave. Any two people can strongly disagree on Elliott Wave counts and its use becomes a very personal focussed one. Sometimes I look at what the Elliott Wave experts agree on and sometimes I disagree with their analysis. Sometimes I am right and sometimes they are right. Sometimes we are all wrong. The HH HL LL LH sequence is the basis of Elliott Wave anyway and it does not have to be that difficult to analyze price action. A trader has to learn how to count his sequence of HH HL LL LH. As of yet I have not seen an indicator that does this properly. If you can do this you can use it to trade nicely. If you master it, you will be well on your way to recognizing and using the most useful parts of the Elliott Wave. The first rule is: A new LH cannot be identified until price moves past the previous high. A new HL cannot be identified until price moves past the previous low. To make charts easier to interpret this, I use Bill Williams Fractals to identify the LL LH HH LH turns in the market. Review posts 8 to 11 for more information on the use of fractals and how to identify the sequence of waves in a Renko Chart. Some notes of interest: My charts will usually use a 10 pip Renko Bar. I will use a consistent template and the same broker for each chart. Variations, such as price differences from broker to broker and pip size of bricks make it difficult to compare charts. If you have a question, post your chart and state your question clearly. Post a 10 pip brick chart if you can and state the size of the bricks. As I continue this, I am going to develop a standard template to use. I also hope to discuss some money-management strategies, use of free Virtual Servers and what I think of as semi- automatic trading - using robots that are suitable for Renko charts. I have spent the last few months really studying the potential of trading Renko Charts with robots and I think some of it is pretty good stuff. So why am I sharing all this? Because I can.

I have tested the free Renko ea at http://www.pimpmyea.com/renko-on-build-600-solution/ and I find that it draws charts that are essentially identical to the Fx Ovo Renko charts. I only noticed one wick that was slightly different. There are also instructions and videos at that site that assist in setting up the Renko off-line charts. On the left is the fx ovo Renko and on the right the pimpmyea Renko. The only difference I could find was with one wick. I will therefore use the fx ovo that I have been using for my charts and hope that any differences between posted charts are not significant. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I'm happy for the reboot of this thread. I was waiting for it few long months. It is one of the most knowledge packed threads and that knowledge is on 14 pages not 1000. I'm curious about your semi automatic approach as nature of renko makes it best traded with pending orders. But when the order is pending the second thinking begins (specially if one doesn't fully trusts himself).

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Compare the highest part of your charts - they are different. The right one has big wick and more price action.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Ah yes ... I missed that additional difference between the two charts. Good eye Krystyn. It is good to be aware that here are differences in the various off-line chart generators and these can have unintended consequences. As I said, I will use the ovo Renko generator and hope that the occasional difference between various peoples charts is not to significant. The semi-automatic ideas that I have been working on will have to wait a bit, as I want to establish some basics first. If we all have the same templates and tools to work with it will be a lot easier. Not that my ideas are unique. Mr. Nims (here on FF and also at TSD) has a good Renko system and there is a free version of the Renko HART ea worth looking at. Eventually I will present three or four systems, mostly using free eas already available in the public domain. Stay tuned. I hope it will be worth the ride.

I once took a course in organic chemistry. I had to spend many hours of my own time (over the summer) studying for an exam on chemical nomenclature. I had to pass that exam before I could take the organic chemistry course. The professor expected us to arrive ready to learn and did not have time to teach us the very basic stuff. Consider the next few posts as an opportunity to learn about some useful tools. I wont have an exam to sort you out and see if you have done your homework. I also don't want to answer very basic questions over and over again. Don't come to a gunfight with a knife. *************************************************************************************************************************** Have a good look at the charts on post #265. You will notice a set of pink lines (vertical and horizontal) on the left hand chart and blue ones on the right hand chart. These lines are going to be an important part of our tool kit. The pink ones are generated by a script called Get Cross and the blue ones by a script called SetCross. Here is an exercise to introduce you to these two scripts: Set up any two charts on the same pair, using different time frames. Have your charts displayed side by side. Drop GetCross on one chart and Set Cross on the other chart. You may have to zoom out to find the pink vertical line on Get Cross. Click on it to select it, then move it to the most recent candle. Set both charts to be about the same in terms of the number of candles displayed on each. Now move the pink vertical line from side to side and watch the blue vertical line. Do the same with the pink horizontal line. A search of FF will reveal the source of these two wonderful scripts. (Thanks to the Sorex for sharing. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4912062 ) These scripts allow you to easily find a location on two different time frames - or on two different bricks size charts. Next, set up two Renko Charts on the same pair, with different sizes of bricks. (I recommend 10 and 30 pip bricks and will mostly be using those sizes.) Play with these two scripts and get familiar with them. You will be seeing them a lot. As I further develop this thread, I plan to introduce the tools and eas that I have found useful. It will be difficult for a new comer to jump in and know what is going on, so I encourage people to do their homework before they start attending the classes. I wont be inclined to answer questions that have already been dealt with. I expect people to do a bit of homework. At this point I expect people to play with Get Cross and Set Cross and become competent users of these two scripts.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Wab Done, the homework what´s next?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Eurix. I will post an update asap. Thanks for your interest.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi Wab, Just wanted to let you know that I am also keeping an eye on the thread. As well as running one of renko 10 pips charts...

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Thanks Juliuy and eurix. If you have followed my thread this far you are familiar with the HH HL LL LH sequence of turns in a chart ... any and every chart. These ultimately detail the Elliott Wave in a chart. EW is a tough study to gain confidence in, but let's take a shot at it in an indirect way. You will need to open four charts: Chart M1M2 is a M1 chart that generates an offline Renko chart that we will call M2. Chart M1M3 is a M1 chart that generates an offline Renko Chart that we will call M3. We will need four templates: M1M2, M1M3, M2 and M3. Once we have these, it is easy to set up a profile. (I will use the GBPUSD in my example.) In our profile we should have charts M1M2, M2 and M3 visible. (M1M3 is essentially the same as M1M2 so it can be minimized or hidden in the background.) Next we put Get Cross on the M3 (30 pip bricks) chart and Set Cross on the M2 (10 pip bricks chart.) Now we look at the M3 chart and do the HH HL LL LH analysis. We determine what the M3 chart is doing and try to establish what is in control. On The GBPUSD Renko 30 chart we can see a reversal where price went through a LH level. Use Get Cross and Set Cross to easily identify this point on the M2 -10 pip brick chart. You can also drop the Set Cross script on the M1 chart and identify the same point there if you have enough data showing. (More on that later.) Note: I used the GBPUSD for this example because the M3 reversal was recent enough to be able to locate it on the M2 chart. As you do this exercise on several pairs you will find some levels are really a long way back and others are more current. In other cases (the EURUSD at the present time) the M3 is between a LL and LH but has not broken past either. Both the LL and LH are a long way back, so we note them. For now will look for a pair with a closer critical point on the M3 30 pip brick chart. The M3 breakouts that continue a trend are also important. We seek reversals or continuations on the 30 pip brick chart. These 30 pip brick locations are known to us well in advance of action on the 10 pip brick chart. HH HL LL LH analysis on the 30 pip brick charts can thereby now be easily located on the 10 pip brick charts using Get Cross and Set Cross. (On the M1 M2 Chart you can also see an indicator that displays a 10 pip brick overlaid on the one minute chart. Let's just leave that for now as there is lot to absorb here.) So play with this a bit. Find some 30 pips turns and line them up on the 10 pip chart. Observe what happens on a ten pip brick chart when the 30 pip chart makes a decision.

HI Wolfsch. The one that eurix suggested above should work. I am using a commercial version of Renko but it appears to be almost identical to the pimped v4 version. Make sure that you have two m1 charts, one for each offline chart.

Thanka a lot guys, I appreciale your help.

Can anyone make a median renko version . Thanks for the work.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
you mean a median renko ea? http://prntscr.com/70ezjd

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Ok. Why am I so interested in comparing charts with different brick sizes? My attempts to develop, or at least test different eas on Renko charts, have lead me to believe that pretty much everything that I have tried thus far might make a good profit in a run but then give it back in a congested market. Unless you can determine the direction of the market flow and set your ea to take trades only in that direction, the eas that I have tried lose over time. The HH HL LL LH rule is always there in a chart and a higher Time Frame or a Bigger Brick chart can tell us what to expect for direction for some time on a Lower Time Frame or Smaller Brick chart. When a bigger brick charts such as the 30 pip brick chart makes a reversal then a 10 pip chart is going to trend in the direction of that 30 pip brick reversal for a while. At that point we can trade in the trend direction with an ea and avoid corrections that tend to cost us pips. We can also monitor the Lower Brick Frame (LBF) to anticipate reversals in the Higher Brick Frame (HBF.) A LBF reversal will occur inside a HBF chart and either confirm or warn us of a reversal point on the HBF. With practice, you can even use fractals on the M1 chart to identify M1 reversals. Just study those a lot before you try to use them in conjunction with Renko reversals, as a M1 chart can reverse several times inside a Renko Bar. (I mention this because it is of interest, but only useful really if you plan to trade in M1 charts.) Next, I would like to talk a bit about money management /strategy and how I like to try and relate it to Renko. For discussion purposes, I will stay with 10 pip bricks. The rule of 72: If you were paying attention that day in school you would have learned that you can divide 72 by the rate of interest that your deposit pays and determine how quickly you will double your money. For example if you invest money at 10% per anum, 72 / 10 = 7.2 years until your money will double. How many bricks will it take to double an account, if each brick is worth 2%? Yes, 31 bricks, as long as each brick is worth 2% of your account when it is closed. Is it possible to get 31 bricks in a week? I am presently in a run that has gone 15 bricks since I entered it, another that has gone 7. With the 7 brick run, at 2% per brick, I have 14%. With the 15 brick run I have 30%. 72 / 30 = 2.4. 72 / 14 = 5.14. Making your bricks worth a percent of your account becomes a very good strategy. (Anyone who finds a flaw in the calculations please advise. I try not to make errors but I know I do. Or, I could just be seeing if you are paying attention. )

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thanks Wab, Very glad you are still sharing your wisdom and knowledge. You have the ability to simplify more advance concepts to a level where it even make sense to a guy like me. O yeah, and only because you said you are checking to see if we are paying attention: 72/ 2 (2% per Renko bar) = 36 not 31 as per your calculations. So you'll need 36 Renko bars. Cheers

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I will plead ... difficult to write and think at the same time. Next I will try and show you how to calculate how large a lot we need to have so that each brick increases an account by 2% per brick. I will use a spreadsheet for that, and again ask for vigilance from the readers.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
One advantage a Renko Chart has over other forms of charting is that it quantifies the data. If we set a brick size to organize our interpretation of a chaotic environment, it allows us to set specific stops and targets. We are not waiting on a lagging indicator to turn, or some other subjective event. We can just look at a Renko Chart and monitor the bricks and the price of the bricks. Have a look at this chart sample that shows three reversals: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In each case a stop of three bricks and one pip is required so that the wick is contained within the stop. (For now, I will leave the spread out of the discussion to keep things a little less complex.) In each case the price then moves on a further 8 bricks, 5 bricks and 4 bricks respectively. How can we set up our trading, so that each brick gained is worth a fixed percentage of our account? Can the moves shown boost our account by a percentage even with a three bar and a pip stop? Attached Image (click to enlarge) We have to take into consideration that any trade has to cover the stop (and the spread.) If our stop was exactly three bricks our risk would be three bricks. To make each brick worth a two percent gain, we have to think carefully about how to calculate that. If we risk three bricks that should be 6% of our account and each subsequent brick would move one third of that distance making its move 2% of the account. Looking at the second chart, and trailing a stop of three bricks and pip, our first trade gives us a yield of five bricks, minus a pip and spread - somewhere above eight and less than ten percent. The second trade gives us a yield of two bricks minus a pip and the spread - somewhere over two percent and less than four percent. The third trade only manages to go one brick before the three brick and a pip stop, plus spread, closes it. It makes two percent minus a pip and the spread. At this point I will throw this open for discussion critique etc.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Clearly the risk is large at 6% and I wonder what your success rate in trades is like to warrant such a gamble. Other than that I like where you are going with this thread as I am looking at something similar based on Renko, Outside Bars and Multiple Timeframes. One of the problems you face with a ten pip renko is that it is such a small bar size that it is easy to lose all your profit in commission and spread. Good luck, I will follow with interest.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I am away for a few days so I won't be able top respond at length just yet. You have indeed hit the nail on the head with your observation that a 6% stop is very large. I agree that a ten pip brick is also hit with the spread and with slippage and that can make up a significant percentage of a one brick move. However, compare the ten and thirty pip charts and that six percent risk is only one brick on the 30 pip charts. For a teaser, think of three ten pip bricks inside each thirty pip brick. I should be back Wednesday night and will continue after that.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Firstly, I like the idea where you quantifies your weekly or monthly or whatever target as a number of bricks (example 36 bricks per week in you earlier post). That together with what % each brick is worth. Its a nice easy and clean way of keeping track of one's progress. Secondly, I also agree that 6% risk per trade is very high. But then to aim at doubling your account in 1 week is also very high in my book. The point is, its scale-able. Say for instance you aim at doubling your account every 2 months (which is still excellent in my books). And say you only risk 1% per brick size. Then it means you will require a nett total of 72 bricks over the 2 month period. That's 36 bricks per month or only about 2 bricks per day. Then with a 3 brick SL it will be a 3% risk per trade which is already becoming more acceptable. Say you only risk 0,5% per brick or 1,5% per trade (3 brick SL), which is quite acceptable. Say you still aim for 36 bricks per month. Then 72/0,5 = 144 bricks. 144/4 months = 36 bricks/ month. Which means you will double your account in 4 months. Still nothing to cry about....far from it. But in the end the calculations are very very easy to make, and its nice to dream. But in the real world the main issue still remains to consistently bag those 36 bricks every month. Month in and month out. And there is where I hope to learn a few things from Wab and this thread. Thanks Wab, for sharing your knowledge. Cheers

--- 帖子 #287 ---
The problem for me with the ten pip charts are the increase in noise. Yes there are more long runs but also more bad trades. Looking forward to your next update max

--- 帖子 #288 ---
They say the best way to really understand something is to try and teach it to someone else. Two very good points have been raised: The noise that exists (with Ten Pip bricks) and the challenge of consistent brick bagging. To deal with these I want to refer back to the use of ten pip bricks and thirty pip bricks and my overall analysis, which looks for a reversal of the HH, HL, LL, LH, trend. I can do the analysis on either chart but I will concentrate on a 10 pip brick chart for a starting place. Attached Image (click to enlarge) (There are many ways to enter a trade and we can go on to discuss a variety of these at a later point. For now I will use this reversal one.) The 10 pip chart that I chose shows three places where a trend reversal has occurred. The down trend was illustrated with red lines and the uptrend with blue lines. Reversal levels are shown with horizontal black lines. Reversal 1. occurs when a LL, LH, LL sequence is changed by a HH. Reversal 2. occurs when a HH, HL, HH sequence is reversed with a LL. Reversal 3. occurs when the market again swings from LL LH LL with a new HH. This is all pretty standard stuff by now and anyone interested in this approach should have mastered identifying these reversals. Now lets see how they relate to the 30 pip brick chart using Set Cross and Get Cross to line things up for us: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The number 1 reversal aligns with color change in the 30 pip bricks, as shown by the pink and blue crosses. When you get a 10 pip brick LL, LH, HH, HL, reversal, which coincides with a reversal pattern on a 30 pip Renko, the stars have aligned. Subsequent LL, LH HH, HL, reversals on the 10 pip chart fit the description of noise - if we concentrate on the 30 pip brick. They occur inside of the 30 pip brick. Many strategies use two different time frames to achieve a good entry level. Using different brick sizes accomplishes the same thing in a more organized way. Big bricks are made from smaller bricks and as you examine the relationship between them, you will find that reversal patterns in the LBF (lower brick frame) often occur within the wicks on a HBF (higher brick frame) chart. This makes for interesting opportunities if you integrate the two wave counts. I think that is enough for now. It may be complex at first, but with practice it becomes easier to read a set of charts like this and integrate a LBF and a HBF strategy. I will make it easier soon (promise) but it is necessary to really get good at the analysis at this point. Some things to try: 1. Check the relationships between HBF wicks and LBF reversal patterns. 2. Use a 6% stop on the 30 pip bricks and see how often it gets hit when you enter on the 10 pip reversal entry.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
A picture is worth a thousand words ... here is a youtube video on HH HL LL LH analysis: Inserted Video Note the horizontal line and trend line that he draws to show the reversal level on each count. He doesn't mark the turns with Fractals, which make is a lot easier. Enjoy.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Wab, Just to let you know that I very much appreciate your contribution here. Please continue. I am just still trying to get my head around your previous post about the 10 pips/ 30 pips charts relationship. I am still struggling to understand its application fully. I think I need to study some more charts. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thanks Mor707. Once you check enough charts (just like the video) you will realize that the small (10 pip brick) HH HL LL LH fits inside the larger one on the 30 pip bricks. A reversal or a breakout on the 30 means that we can expect some clear direction for a while at least on the 10. When I get to entry signals I hope it becomes easier to relate. Unfortunately, I will offline for about three weeks starting next week. I hope to bale to do a meaningful update before I am away.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Wab. Thanks for youtube video. I find it really helpful and simple. Especially when he talk about consolidation and how to deal with it. Market not really form HH HL LL LH in beautiful way and this consolidation and trendline knowledge really helpful to see if trend really reverse or just retracement. And thanks for your contribution here in this thread.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
It is a good video. Renko makes it even better. On every chart there is a point at which the HH HL LL LH pattern reverses. You can identify these places and draw a horizontal line to the right. I call this line the E line (E for entry or Exit.) The E line occurs when price breaks above a LH or below a HL and reverses the trend. Here is an example on a 30 pip brick chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) From here on you should add the E line to every chart and the potential E line, teh line at which a trend reversal will occur if price penetrates it. Now I will add fractals to this chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can observe that at every HH HL LL LH there is a fractal and a wick. Also, at every other fractal there is a wick. Now here is an important concept to understand: At every single fractal (wick) there is a reversal pattern going on, on a smaller scale. The reversal pattern is visible if you compare the 30 pip bricks to the 10 pip bricks. You can use Get Cross and Set Cross to line these up for analysis. Locate any fractal on the 30 pip bricks then cross reference it on the 10 pip bricks. Have a good look at the HH HL LL LH sequence on the 10 pip bricks and you will just about always locate a reversal pattern and then you can locate a 10 pip brick E line. Practice this and then practice it some more. Sometimes the E line on the ten pip bricks is quite a way from the top or bottom. This one was reasonably close and therefore presented a nice trade opportunity. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You need to be able to identify the E line on the Ten pip brick charts with a glance. That comes with practice. Once you can do this we will start into how to trade it effectively. I am not going to be able to update for about three weeks, starting on Sunday. That will give you lots of time to master the E line search and to start placing it on all your Renko Charts. Be sure to draw a potential E line at the last LH and HL. When the price breaks those you have a reversal and pending orders at those levels tend to make you happy. (That last chart had a nice run after the E line was broken ... they often do.) Also have a look at the relationship between a 10 pip E line and where it occurs on the 30 pip chart. You just may notice something special working it form LBF to HBF. (There is always something interesting to learn when you look hard enough.) In later posts I will introduce a nice signal from Bill Williams book "Trading Chaos" It is often earlier than the E line and very reliable. We will also look at a way to chart the LBF and the HBF on the same chart. Lots ahead.

Makes a lot of sense. Do you start looking for a new E line on the 10 after a reversal brick with a wick (potential fractal)? Or do you wait for the fractal confirmation? Because then you would start looking at the 10 when you're already 120+ pips on the way. And price has gone through the E line already.

Hi, Seeing that Wab may only reply in a couple of weeks time and also to test my own understanding, I'm going to try and answer this one: I think what Wab said is; we should watch out for wicks on the 30 bricks chart or in other words a turning point/ reversal, which is 2 bars prior to a fractal been shown.

I was away a bit longer than I expected, now back to work. I hope top be around for the rest of the summer at least. Thanks to Eurix and Blaiserboy for the Global Crosshairs and compiler. We can always use additional tools. I see that MT4 has been up to its tricks again and builds 800 + are causing issues. For now, I have refrained from updating my MT4 until I learn more about that issue - if it is indeed an issue as some people are suggesting. Hopefully the changes will not impact any of the tools that we will apply here. I will continue on with some further discussion on the HBF and LBF charts as soon as I am up to speed. Probably starting tomorrow. Thanks for everyone's patience.

Couldn't get smiley face to appear even though renko bars were forming on the M6 once I changed the bars to candles. Recalled from the past that Common tab needs to be addressed. Experimented without success in changing face to make it smile, so searched on ff and found answer. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=255020 Went to tools and followed directions. The pdf file didn't mention the common tab, unless I somehow missed the mention.

Welcome back Wab, Looking forward to your ongoing teachings Regards

The EURUSD has been in the news a lot because of the Greek Crisis. Let's begin by looking at that pair and seeing if the 30 -10 brick analysis helps. This chart has a lot on it and it is worth a lot of study because it shows the thinking that goes into a much simpler analysis that I will present in a while. If you remember algebra there was that thing called the quadratic equation. A good math teacher would show you how it was derived and that was interesting if you were a math nerd. However you only needed to know the equation in order to solve the problems. Knowing how the equation was derived helped understand what it was you were doing with the formula, but anyone who knew the formula could solve the questions. Let's dissect the EURUSD 30 1- combo in detail then and see if we can simplify it afterwards. Attached Image (click to enlarge) First of all check the HH LH reversal on the 10 Pip brick chart. The HH in Elliott Wave terms is the zero of a new wave. AS we add our LL LH sequence, we reveal the Elliott Wave count. Some confusion occurs at what the Elliott Wave would label as wave four. Strictly speaking it is not a LH, but the advantage in EW counting is that we expect congestion in a wave four. Also note the AO indicator pulls back to zero or above in a wave four correction. I really urge serious analysts to read Bill Williams’ books and learn how the AO works in conjunction with the EW.) In EW theory a trend line that extends through the wave two and wave four peaks creates a useful channel when a parallel trend line is drawn from the peak of wave three. Wave Five will often form near or on the parallel trend line. I have drawn these trend lines and additional ones, that also show the wave four congestion (with red lines.) Sure enough, as price approaches the lower red channel line we see a LL HL reversal on the 10 pip bricks as a wick forms on the 30 pip bricks. The AO confirms this and a blue horizontal E line also shows up as we follow the new HH HL in the reversal. Note how a lot of things come together here. I have drawn an ellipse to emphasize the area. The market rallies from a five wave bearish move and moves up. EW suggests that this may be wave TWO now after a wave ONE completed, but that is just a suggestion. EW is great when you get it correct but we need evidence to support the possible map it reveals. A wave TWO would probably top out around the 61.8% level, so we can add a fib on the 30 pip bricks and monitor that Fib level for a reversal. Look for a wick on the thirty pip bricks and a reversal of the HH HL on the 10 pip bricks. OK that is a lot to digest. If you are not Elliott Wave savvy, does it really matter? The HH HL LL LH sequence reveals the structure. The E line gets broken and a reversal occurs. The rest is fine feathers on the bird. AO nicely confirms that which we already know. Fibonacci is great if you can understand it. (We will use it a lot.) EW channels are useful and the EW count helps with that, but again it is the E line that tells us the most important thing. We expect it to form in the 10 pip bricks inside a 30 pip wick. Lots to study here: I want you to study it before I make it a lot simpler. Just like the quadratic formula is easy to use, when you don’t have to derive it each time, I will try to reduce all of this to a much simpler approach. Understanding what the formula does is important so that you can apply it correctly. Have fun. If some of this is baffling don't worry. We will practice lots and it will become a lot easier when we reduce it all to a very simple system.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
The more simple approach: Here is the same chart we have been looking at - just a bit further advanced. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You will notice a red moving average line. This the Teeth line of the Bill Williams Alligator, an 8 smoothed MA of the median price displaced 5. (The settings are visible in the Alligator and it is the same red line that is shown in the Alligator.) Now the Teeth line has a special relationship with certain Fractals. If you look at the fractal labelled BWF 1 (Bill Williams Fractal 1) it is the last fractal to the left of the Teeth line and below the Teeth line. When price penetrates that fractal below the Teeth line it is sell signal. Similarly, the fractal labelled BWF 2 is the first fractal where price is above the Teeth Line. When price penetrates above that fractal it is a buy signal. (I showed that buy signal with a dotted blue line to compare it with the solid blue E line that was drawn from the first HH.) More recently on the chart, is a third horizontal blue line. By definition it is not a LH. However, if price were to drop through the Teeth line and then penetrate this blue line it would become a BWF sell signal. Chances are that a down fractal will form first and the potential BWF sell fractal would be adjusted to the new down fractal level. That fractal will then also become a LH and also mark a potential E line. The E line and the BWF fractal entry are often one and the same. Two methods combined to give the same signal. When they are different, one confirms the other. Now all of the stuff that I had on the previous chart, while nice and informative, can be reduced to this simple version of the same thing. HH HL LL LH and the BWF /Teeth combination tells you a tremendous about what the market is up to. The Teeth line has another attribute which is very powerful: A trending market avoids it and a corrective market will correct back towards it. On the second chart, counter trend lines drawn at 1, 2, 3 and 4, present opportunities for long trades. The down fractal and interaction with the Teeth line help determine where to draw these counter trend, trend lines. A break of these lines is an entry signal, or it can be an alert that the recent HH is about to be broken as well. Both breaks are valid entry signals and lead to various trade strategies. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Bonus: The Teeth line also makes a great trailing stop when you give it an extra pip or so as a buffer. I hope this is easy enough to follow. At first it may be a bit overwhelming but soon it is a matter of eyeballing a chart and knowing what is going on. Consider that this is the present EURUSD chart in the midst of a financial crisis and I let it speak for itself. Next, I think we should look at some chart and practice this idea.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Practice. Wick on the 30 pip bricks. 10 pip brick trend reversal, BWF and then entries on counter trend, trend line breaks. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So how do we manage trades like this?

WAB A guy wrote in another thread....... that BW indicators were 50 years old and out of date and old fashioned... and I replied...... I have a whole portfolio of stategies based on those indicators. And then I posted the portfolio numbers showing a success rate of 82%, I think there was 27 different strategies in the portfolio. No reply.. It is most worthwhile and prudent to apply BW to projects that involve your money! Thanks WAB, for sharing your approaches. daveM

It makes more and more sense. I love renko but it seems one way love. Spent hundreds of hours looking at them life. They need constant attention and 5 minutes of rest can make 2 hours of hunting go to space. What you show us is a very clear way of analysis that limits the necessity of attention. It helps to see if price is in a critical area or not. If it isn't - rest, if it is - load your trap and rest.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
When you finally figure something that works do you keep it to yourself or share it? How about if you have several things that work? Well, I have shared several things here: Trend Reversal entries, Counter Trend Line Entries and the BWF signal. None of these are really my own discoveries. Nor, I suspect, is using higher and lower brick frames to try and discern the overall trend. I don't really think there is too much that has been missed by the many keen minds that have studied charts. I have to give credit to Bill Williams for his material and I wish I had run across Clive Pakenham a lot earlier (thanks for that link mor707.) As for Bill Williams ideas being old, the Law of Gravity is pretty old too and it still works very reliably. I do think that while many people have found many great ways to enter trades (and close them) there has not been as much attention paid to managing trades. That is where I will take this discussion next. When the dog finally catches a car - what to do with it becomes the all-important question? So I would now like to introduce the concept of what I call FOREX trade management. FOREX is an acronym and it stands for Flat, Oblique, Reward, Entry and Extension. Before I start, if anyone is familiar with similar studies please give us links to look at them. What I propose here may not be unique or even original, but it is my explanation of what I do in my own terms. I hope that you find it useful and if it is an original approach allow me to claim it, before all the hucksters jump all over it and try to sell it. "FOREX" trade management is my methodical approach to both the identification of a trading opportunity and management of any trade taken. It is price action based and evolves from the HH HL LL LH reversals and subsequent corrections that we have already studied and drawn E lines and counter trend lines on. I hope to make it very mechanical in nature, following rules each time and thereby reducing the emotional component of taking and managing a trade. As always, lets begin with a chart example, one that has a reversal pattern, or in this case, two reversal patterns. Attached Image (click to enlarge) By now you should be able to identify the E lines where a HH HL LL LH trend reversal can take place and where it actually does. Entering a short trade on the Red E line is an acceptable strategy. We draw a flat (horizontal blue) line there and extend it to the right. When the LL fractal forms below the E line break we expect a LH fractal to form on what is now a count trend. We draw an oblique line (also blue) from the LL fractal to the LH fractal. We are using Renko bars with wicks and we know a wick just about always forms on a Renko color change reversal pattern, so we can pretty much pick out that LH fractal as it forms by looking for a wick. Our oblique line joins the LL and LH fractals and while we wont always get his right until after it forms we will get good at it with practice and a little help from the AO. We know indicators lag, so we need to give the AO a bit of time to catch up. (More on that in a minute.) Next we construct the vertical component of the figure four. This is done by dropping a vertical line from the LH end of the Oblique line through the flat line. This is the reward line. The middle of the Reward Line must be on the Flat line as shown. This will graphically locate the reward that we hope to gain from this structure. (In this case the reward was 135 pips when the price target at the end of the reward line was hit.) Now, back to the problem of the lagging AO, if we wait to enter our trade at the midpoint of the Oblique line, the AO has changed color. This is a confirmation of our strategy if you give credence to indicators. By the time price has moved to the middle of the Oblique Line we have our Entry. A brick reversal pattern formed earlier and we enter at the 50% level as the AO confirms momentum. I left the Oblique line selected to show its midpoint and placed a dotted red line to the right of the midpoint, to show where the entry is achieved. A stop is placed just above the top of the oblique LH fractal. (More Bill Williams stuff.) The whole thing is done by drawing three lines on the chart, at the correct places, to make a figure four. Orders, stops and take profit levels are intuitive after that. We have a F lat an O blique a R eward an E ntry and an e X tension. (I have not discussed the extension yet. This is already a pretty big post.) "FOREX." Further to the right on the chart the process is repeated with a bullish trend reversal. Here we have an inverted figure four. Reward this time is 161 pips at the end of the vertical reward line. The price level was hit off the right hand side of the chart but I did not compress the chart to show this. For now, there is a lot to digest here. Do some homework. Try it out on a lot of charts and see how it works. Strategy is next and coming up there is also a very neat dynamic tool to do this with. Have fun.

Hallo Wab Thank you for your explanations. This stuff is very helpfull . Am I right or wrong in this picture? Its EURUSD

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I just moved you to top of the class eurix. Same trade that I took and it has nearly reached the target now. The AO on the 30 brick chart is still red, so it still has a good chance of forming an up fractal on the 10 pip bricks and going all the way to it. This is also actually a good example to use the Teeth line for a trailing stop. Isn't it nice when theory and practice actually cooperate? You made my day. Good work! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #316 ---
... and this is how that trade finished ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price just about hit the Reward level then pulled back. I took two lots, closing one at the Flat line to guarantee a profit. I moved my stop to the Flat line for the second lot, locking it a profit on that lot. I mentioned that the Teeth line was a good place to move a trailing type stop when nervous, but I didn't do it on this trade. If I had also been watching this trade, I would have see a new E line form and that would definitely had me close the second lot. As it was I was not able to monitor it and have to be satisfied with two lots closed at the Flat line. A bullish, new, Flat line is shown with an HH fractal. Now we watch for the Oblique line to end on a down fractal draw an inverted Four and repeat.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
so I see in your picture, it´s not necessary that the price is under the teethline to go short., right? today eurusd we got the first target and if the second lot run into the stop we are nearly at BE with this trade. and if we close the trade when price crosses the teethline we got a win trade. do you use only 10 pip bricks or smaller ones too? do you know how high your hitrate is on this system? thank you for your effort.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Here is how I played the inverted four; which was the next reversal trade. Once again you nailed it with your inverted Four eurix. Good job. Attached Image (click to enlarge) When price hit the Flat line it closed my first lot. I Moved the stop on the second lot up to protect it from losses and at that point left it to its own devices. A one win, no loss possible, situation. As it turned out, that is what I got. One win at the Flat line and a stop loss hit just above the 50% level. In both of these trades, I was looking for a trend reversal. As we go along we will learn how to use the Four in other places. Bear with me on the Teeth line and you will see how I use it. In both of the trades so far the Teeth line has not really been that useful. It will make sense as we go along. As for brick size, it works on any chart, not just Renko Charts. Renko is a lot easier though. A 10 pip brick size is my preference here as it moves along at a nice pace for teaching purposes. With smaller brick sizes you will get Fours that give very small Flat line targets. As we get into the extension aspect you will find that smaller Fours have their appeal. The basic FOREX trade is there but how it is used will depend on each trader. Think of a 1,2,3 or an A B C D or a Ross Hook or an Elliott Wave trader. They all basically trade the same thing based on different understanding of the same chart. My Four is an attempt to make the trading process very visual and achieve comparable results to other proven methods. Is it different, or does it overlap those other methods? Yes to both questions. You will find your own comfort level and adapt how you use this. Here are some order strategies to consider: Early entry when the bricks change color this has the advantage of a small stop loss, but will be difficult to catch if the correction has more than one wave in it. It is best to avoid this depending on your risk aversion. If you are wrong, a smaller Four will result which can still be profitable but may get stopped out. Enter at the 50% level of the Oblique - often has the advantage of a confirmation from the AO. Sometimes this entry is actually only slightly beyond the color change of a brick reversal in a very tight four. I prefer to see a bit of separation there but that is a matter of preference. Enter at a 61.8% level instead of a 50% level. (Or enter at both if you are really aggressive.) The 61.8% entry is built in to the Extension tool. Along with the extended target, X, at 161.8% Logic behind taking multiple trades: Always T.P. on one lot at the Flat then move your stop up to the entry level plus a pip or two. This covers costs and generates a secured profit. This makes the second lot a free trade and guarantees a profit if the Reward Target is not reached. This is a very important strategy. The object is to take a profit and protect your account first and then try for the larger profit if/when the market reaches the Reward level. Set your target just a bit before the Reward level. If a lot of people ate looking for a double it is good psychology to exit just before the rush. If price action is a concern trail a stop a pip or so above the Teeth line. Anytime you get into a trade with a small four and price is quite well removed from the Teeth line, it can move along way before it moves back into the Teeth line. As for success rate, you will just about always hit the Flat line if you have read the trend correctly and trade the trend reversal patterns, however there iare more situations that we have yet to discuss, where the four can be applied. In my next post I am going to give you a neat little tool that really makes the study of Fours a bit easier - as if it wasn't easy enough already.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Okay, as promised: There is a neat little tool that already exists in MT4, the Fibonacci Expansion Tool. Just change the settings like this. Attached Image Now you can use the Extension Tool to draw a Four, or an inverted Four, on a chart. It does have the advantage of displaying a 61.8% early entry level and the 1.618 Extension - the X of the FOREX acronym. Personally, I find the Four easy enough to draw with trend lines but most traders enjoy any shortcuts that are available and this displays the labels and prices that are important.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Some examples of Fours that are not based on trend reversals: I call these Correctional Fours. These are based on corrections against the trend. The price crosses the Teeth line and forms a fractal. As long as the AO is below the zero line these work well. (Of course you reverse that rule for Bullish Fours, where you will want the AO above the zero line.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Each Four shows the pips it wins on one lot, with all calculations from the 50% level. Trades that have an X are ones that went to the extension level at 161.8% Each trade at least made the Flat line. Look for a trend reversal. trade it and then trade the counter trends that come along. Keep adjusting the potential E line and then go the other way.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
In regards to different brick sizes or even time based charts. Here is one I just traded on the USDCAD M5. I let both lots run to nearly the Reward level and manually closed them. I liked the chart so I did not take profit on one lot at the Flat, I just let it move along to the Reward. 22 pips thank you. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #322 ---
And how has the EURUSD been doing? Some trades made the Reward level, all made the Flat level. Pip returns at the Flat and at the Reward are shown. Present Four Trade is still in progress with profit taken on the first lot, stop needs to be moved now. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #323 ---
HHLLHLHH is still confusing me. In the picture we see left a LL and next a LH then a LL that confirms the LH before, as the price runs further we see now a new fractal above the left LH. but the price did not going up after, instead it made a new LL this confirmed that the left LH goes to the right fractal an makes there the LH and the left LL goes to the right fractal too? am i right or wrong? Dont pay attention to the next HH, its wrong. the fractal is on a lower level than the last LH. I did send you 2 PMs Attached Image (click to enlarge) in the next picture we see a HH? and HL? but the HL is not confirmed by a new HH, so how is this situation to handle? Attached Image (click to enlarge) and the last picture there is no fractal but if we use the expansion we see the early entry would be triggert. so this is a loss? because sometimes the fractal is not ready jet and we go for a entry like in your picture above. sorry for my english, i hope you understand what i mean. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I did send you 2 PMs

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi eurix. Some good questions that will help illustrate some important points. I have been at this for along time and I also have a strong Elliott Wave background, so I tend to not emphasize some things that are not as readily accessible to other people. Here is your first chart re-visited: Attached Image First of all, always zoom way out to get the big picture before you attempt analysis. The HH HL LL LH structure will be more apparent that way. I do not know what happened to the left (yellow line with ? on the top left) so, that leaves me at a disadvantage. The left contains information that is needed for the analysis in the present. Once you can get the big picture, you become better at identifying internal waves inside the large ones. I have put yellow check marks on what is likely the correct "larger" LL LH count. If you go back and do the HH HL LL LH count on the chart you will soon see that there are little waves inside the big ones, They will will show up and confuse, as happened here. It takes practice until you get a better feel for it. Waves within waves is always a tricky thing and I don't always get it right either. Inside the yellow circle you identify a LL LH which could have been traded short for a Flat Line profit. Price corrects and rises towards the Teeth line and forms a fractal. However, price did not rise above the Teeth line. It is a more reliable trade when that happens. The second time it corrects price goes above the Teeth line. I placed a yellow Four there ( numbered 1) and it is a good trade to the flat line. As long as you are in synch with the trend, these generally give you at least a Flat Line profit. We then get two inverted Four patterns, numbered 2 and 3. Price rallies then corrects below the Teeth Line. Both of these are good trades, but I have not told you how to identify these yet as they occur before we get an E line break. I will cover how to find these when I talk about the BF Fork, at a future date. Do not despair. The HH HL LL LH count takes time to master and is tough to do as it evolves. The HBF chart and the AO help sort out where you are and the Teeth line is really great. After a while you will read it more easily. If you send me info on which pair and what brick size this first chart was, I will try to build a better picture for you. In your second two charts, I think that both situations will become more clear as we discuss the BF fork, which is a very good way of predicting and or confirming a trend reversal. Let me know which chart number 1 was and I will do an extensive review of it, before I go on to the BF fork. I hope that will help. Learning how to do trade from a discussion thread is a bit like learning how to swim, by reading a bunch of instructions and looking at a lot of pictures of people swimming. Not easy when you are actually in deep water. Good questions.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I have attached some indicators that may be of assistance with the HH HL LL LH thing. Use with caution. One is a fractal zigzag which can be helpful. The other two are also zigzag indicators. The latter two show a higher degree HH HL LL LH and a lower degree HH HL LL LH which occurs inside the larger waves. As you study these you will see that there are times when they are wrong. That is why I don't really depend on them. However they may be useful to help understand the whole concept of smaller degree HH HL LL LH within larger degree HH HL LL LH counts. Using the HBF 30 pip bricks is an attempt to do the same thing. My advice is to learn how to do it yourself. Indicators like this are not that useful, unless you understand what they are attempting to tell you. Once you understand that, you don't need them anyway. Kind of like training wheels on a bicycle - who needs those after you learn to ride?

All 3 pictures are from the GBPAUD 10 Pip Bricks.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
This is getting very Elliott Wave. Sorry about that, but that is actually how the market works and my FOREX approach is just an attempt to simplify it. OK here we go - GBPAUD 10 pip bricks First of all, I like to zoom way out and eyeball the chart. Then I add the waves that I can see. Waves join extreme highs and lows and lows and highs. After a bit of practice this gets easy enough to do. On the chart I used purple lines to show the larger structure. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Next, I add my HH HL LL LH labels on the purple lines. I can see these pretty easily on historical part of the chart. I identify the E line for the purple structure. That big E line tells me a lot about what to expect after price moves up through it. It could move up to a big HH. We won't know for sure until it does. It could become a big LH , but that doesn't matter for now. We are after trades that will occur on the way, (Note: I should have added a purple LL on that last down move.) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Now we start to focus in on the current wave structure. We have a good idea of what the larger waves are doing and we now get ready to analyze the waves inside of the more recent ones. We can eyeball the HH HL LL LH structure or use fractals to draw this in. A very sharp eye will notice that there are smaller HH HL LL LH structures in between the fractals. (Hint look just to the left of the last LL.) If you used smaller bricks on a separate chart, this would show up and be easy to see. That is why I like both a HBF chart and a LBF chart work with. We are going to look for trades on this smaller scale but always keep an eye on that bigger E line. It is very powerful. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Now we do our detailed analysis: This reveals the places that we can trade a Four on this particular structure. Our reversals become easy to find because we know where to look for them. The red E lines and the Bill Williams Fractals show up and alert us to trend changes. Once we know the trend direction we look for counter trends that (preferably) cross the Teeth line. Drawing a Four follows. All market charts do this. [On one occasion, several years back, I did this exact analysis on the OEX and refined it further and further down until I was right in the M1 charts. I caught a turn on M1 that evolved all the way up with each wave degree until I was up over $20k in a few hours, on call options. It was a thrilling ride.] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now, see how many trades you could have done here from the counter trends, just drawing a Figure Four. Bill Williams uses break out trades as price moves past the latest fractal in the trend. By using Four on the counter trends, we can gain on that by an extra 50% to 61.8% per trade. I hope all this analysis of the GBPAUD clears up some of the confusion. I still haven't got to the BW Fork. It will help further. One more thing: The divergence on the AO tells me that GBPAUD is at the end of wave three and now in wave four. The market is always choppy in a wave four. I expect a trend reversal to the upside will be the next good trading opportunity.

HI WAB, i have question about demark indicator what you attached on first post. is Dot (yellow highlight) repaint / lagging?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Basically the dots are fractals. An up fractal is formed when the two bars before it have lower highs and the two bars after have lower highs. It looks like your hand, with the middle finger as the peak. A down fractal is the opposite. By their very nature, a fractal appears to re-paint as it forms. Once it has formed with all five bars it will not repaint. At present I am not using the Demark indicator but it will soon be in use again, when I introduce the BW fork.

I had to search for some videos that explain what I am leading up to. (Since I still have traces of a South African Accent, I enjoyed this. If/when I make a video of my own, it will not have as strong an accent - though people tell me I have a sort of Canadian accent these days, eh.) I found two videos that I like: (One I have had uploaded to my computer for several years and was delighted to find it is still on line.) Both of these are worth uploading and keeping in your resources for future reference. Another that I uploaded is no longer available anywhere. I guess I need to make a video of my own to explain some things, then I don' have to worry about finding one, that sort of does what I need. Anyhow, the first gets us started nicely and I urge you to look for the HH HL LL LH price reversal, explained here in a slightly different manner. It soon becomes a very recognizable pattern. No matter what we call this or how we decide to trade it, it is pure market behavior and occurs over and over again. Yes, on Renko Charts too. The second video will follow once you have had a chance to digest this one a bit. Inserted Video

Well I for one feels right at home with all the recognizable accents. Wab, now that I know more about your background, I like you even more. While I not yet use everything that you teach....I am more of a scalper type trader at this stage.......I must admit that the MACD(5,34,5), the Alligator Teeth MA and your whole concept of HH,HL, etc with E-line etc have already made a huge difference to my own trading. First time ever that I feel that I can start to sort of see the bigger picture of where the market might probably go. Or have some grasp of market structure. Baie dankie!

I have been working on some really neat stuff so it has been a while since I posted. Today I would like to link to a video that really nails the whole concept of trend reversal. Pay close attention to the trend line and how it relates to the HH HL LL LH sequence. That trend line is similar to the De Mark trend line and also part of what I call the BW Hook. This video also introduces Fibonacci into the mix and that in turn is very powerful. We will cover Fibonacci in due course. Now be sure to be alert to see where the E line fits into this. A lot comes together here. It is an excellent video and leads to many good points of HH HL LL LH. Enjoy. Inserted Video

The continual upgrades to Mt4 (hardly upgrades when they cause so many problems) are causing me to really wonder about the usefulness of this application. The recent build 840 has a had a negative affect on some of my most critical endeavors. Trading is difficult enough without this on-going issue. If anyone has any ideas about when they will slow down or even stop all these crappy updates I would be most interested. Ninja Trader looks better by the day.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Mt4 is well known not to be the best platform, but I think platform doesn't matter. System goodness matters. And your system is more than good...

--- 帖子 #346 ---
very nice video wab. ninja trader is made for trader, mt4 is made for broker. thats why the most broker offer mt4 and only vew nt. i don´t know much about nt, but the advantage from mt4 is the incredible numbers of indictaors, eas, and scripts. if you use only price action the nj seems to be better. but my knowledge on nj is very limited.

The BF Fork. The BF Fork is a combination of the E line or the first fractal level past the red Teeth Line and a trend line. You may recall that the E line and the BW Fractal line may often occur on the same fractal. Either way we extend a horizontal line from the E Line Fractal or the BW Fractal to the right. We know that when the price breaks either of those levels, or both, that a trend reversal has occurred. The HH HL LL LH count confirms this with the E line and the BW Fractal line can give an early warning or be used by itself. Now if we look at the last two significant fractals and use the Tom De Mark method of drawing a trend line, using those two fractals, we find the trend line is the handle of a fork and the E line or BW Fractal Line is the tine. Let’s look at a chart to see this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is the current EURUSD 10 pip Renko chart, forming a Fork as I write this. The Trend line has been broken, the E line has also been broken. The two of them form a fork which I call the BW fork. (B for my last initial and W for William. A little vanity there.) The BW Fork is a powerful visual indicator. If price goes back above the tine (trend line) of the fork then the reversal becomes suspect. Price most often breaks below the E line or BW Fractal Line (They are the same in this example, but can be different as we know.) Then price most often moves back up into the BW Fork area. Once it is back in the fork it often forms a fractal and that is the fractal that Elliott calls wave two. (Note it may not form a fractal all of the time, but looking at a LBF or a LTF chart will reveal that there is always one there.) So how to trade it? The safest method is to open a trade as it crosses the E line again. That puts us in a third wave and Fibonacci comes into play. Let us see how this one works out.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Here is another example that where I am presently trading a figure four. The game begins with a trend reversal and a Fork displayed in white lines. Note how the E line (in yellow) was later to the party than the Fork. I missed a reversal trade there however, I then located a Four (shown in yellow lines) and traded it for 110.2 pips from the 50% entry level to the Reward level. A second four, shown by a diagonal black line joining the wick to wick of two opposing fractals was not traded because I was already in a trade. It was also a good potential trade, in case you had missed the first one. Then I took another four, this time with white lines and I am presently near the reward level on that one. In fact. I just checked and it closed for another 111.5 pips, so I updated the chart to show it. Not often I post just as a trade is concluding like this. Nice when it happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Did I use any indicators? I did look at the divergence on the AO and the Teeth line for the BW fractal. Study this chart. It is good example of a BW Fork, an E line trend reversal and three figure four trades. Best of all it is an example of theory and practice working together perfectly. having said that, there was a trade that I missed. I missed it because I arrived late but we will get to that type of trade in a bit. Check the purple Fibonacci line with its dotted white Fibonacci levels and see if you can spot it. After the new HH we get a LH at the 61.8% level. A trade taken there would currently be up 269 pips. It can be done. Has been done many times. Now that we have dealt with HH HL LL LH, E lines, BW Forks and Figure Fours, we are ready for Fibonacci. Stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I might as well just carry on with the Fibonacci material as this is such a good example. I cleaned up the chart to illustrate the concept more clearly. When you get a trend reversal, there is an opportunity to draw a Fib on the first HH and see at what Fib level the first LH will form. This one was at the 61.8% pullback level. The sweet spot is around 61.8% with a fractal, although a fractal may not always form on the pullback. This time one did. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The pullback gives us a wick to wick line for a Figure Four trade. I placed the first black line there to illustrate it. The Fibonacci is drawn in purple. With a 61.8% pullback, it gives us an entry at the 61.8% level and a target at the 161.8% level. You can see how that worked out. A Fibonacci constructed in this manner is very powerful. Even though I missed it I was confident with the figure four trades that followed because the reward level for each was inside of the 161.8 Fibonacci target. So there you have it - Fibonacci Reversal Trades and Figure Four Trades. Priceless.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
So how about the EURUSD trade started yesterday? I took a 0.1 lot trade on each of the Fibonacci levels. The trick now is to know when to exit. The Alligator is wide open, so I am looking at the 100% target though the 61.8% target is just about there. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will have to decide in a few hours, as I am away tomorrow and will not be able to monitor the trade further.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
EURUSD Trade Closed. Good enough. I have to head out of town in a couple of hours and won't be back until Monday night. The blue channel seems to be holding for now so I won't stay in. This move was corrective in nature with all the overlapping waves. Hoping to get to a 100% level is too risky for me at this point. The AO has three green bars and AC has a buy signal. Maybe it will challenge the upper, red trend line and break out higher next. Locate the potential E line, keep an eye on the BW fractal in relation to the Teeth Line and see what Fibonacci tells us, when a trend reversal and a BW Fork comes along. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Take the cash and let the credit go. 72. 54. 34. and 27 pips banked.

Nice trade Wab, Did you also check the 30pips chart?, The chart you show, I see in the afternoon of the 29th., the price break the Smooth 8 MA line and 2 fractals( the 5 upward green bricks) , so is it just experience to not close any of your open position? Or, because there is no a HH?. Thanks

Hello everyone i'm new on this thread. Thank you Wab for sharing your knowledge, when i start to read this thread i was interested about " KISS " Keep It Simple Simple, after reading all post ( i will read it again for sure ) i think we can't called it anymore KISS, sorry i not wanna be rude or ruin your work i really like your way to trade but, from post 1 to 264 you change and use many indicator, from 264 to now you change it again (removed previous indicator but adding another pair.) I'm here just for share my opinion i'm a newbie so, maybe this kind of strategy are for veteran or who are advance on trading system (i started my journy into forex on 2010) i just want to understand one stuff, you can still call your strategy simple ? However how i already tell, i'm going to read again everything to try to figure out with it, because all people dosen't have the same mind and of course any of us need some time for understand everything. Thank's any of you for spend time to read my post. Best wishes. H

To Hyperfire and Peterrs: Read and read again. It is one of the shortest threads on ff yet one of the heaviest in content (in positive sense). When it sinks in you it IS KISS. But give yourself a chance and read it slowly and ‎thoroughly.

Hello everyone, Thank you Krystyn, how i already says i'm gonna to read all thread again many time needed, but i was just curios to know if Wab and other memember like you still consider this a KISS system or not that's all.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
hi Hyperfire i was trading stocks from 1998 up to 2008 and from 2008 up to now i am trading forex. forex sucessful from about 2012. i tried a lot of systems and indis belief me. the most were useless. for me priceaction trading works best, like this one here. my system is much more complicated and i will bring some parts of wab´s system into my system to get more profitable. we must find a system that suits our personality and if we find it we have to stuck to this system until we are perfect. than we can add another system and so on. so i did. but not at the beginning. i was jumping from one system to the other like a bunny. if you find a system that brings constant winnings with an arrow up for by and one down for sell, please tell us. but i am afraid such a system doesn´t exist. for constant winnings you need your brain because the big boys are very smart and we fight against them. they call us the dump money. you know why? i bet you know. wab´s system is in my opinion not very complicated. especially if we get use to it. like every sytem we have to train it and when we know it than its easy. I am trading renko, a other system, but i am learning every day someting new and i would not stop learning. if we stop learning the smart boys takes our money. this here is in my opinon a advanced system, but not a complicated, if you learned it, it brings you a lot forward. if i found it earlier when i was a beginner, this would saved me a lot of timewasting to try useless systems from this or that guru. so thank you a lot, wab and all others wich makes konstruktiv work in here and sorry for my bad english.

--- 帖子 #364 ---

Hello everyone and sorry for the late reply. Thank you Eurix for sharing your opinion, i can understand everything you said without problem, of course i can agreed with you. I just asking an opinion, and in your words we can find why i have ask it; because there is a lot of system and how you already says is very strange to find a suitable strategy for every of us. I start to read the post and everything look brilliant, after some time i get a lot of confusion because many other indicator was added, and after some time the post was rebooted and everything change again, well yeah i know this is the FOREX, yes we need to be smart and move arround this jungle or we can be eaten from big boys, but the chaos dosen't help, that's why i ask if any of you an opinion. I hope my words are not misunderstood, i not says " hey the Wab system is horrible or it dosen't work " i just ask an opinion that's all. P.s The system with arrow up for buy and arrow down for a sell, wow that's can be impressive and awesome, by the way big boy dosen't let us to use it, because they do the best for ruin our trade record ! I appreciate your post so much. Thank's to you and everyone. Have nice day. H.

Hi Hyperfire and everybody else, Here's my own comments on this discussion point: I found whats lacking in my own trading is an understanding and reading of the bigger picture of what is happening in the market. In other words, sometimes the exact same setup will work in one instance but fail in another. Now I know part of the reason for that is purely due to the randomness of the market. But I also know from monitoring better traders than myself, that they have the ability to be more selective in picking their trades. And I think the difference is that they have a better feel for the overall direction and sentiment in the market. The bigger picture as I will call it. Whats Wab is doing here is he is giving me tools (HH,HL,LL,LH and E-line, when the trend direction change etc) to enhance my own ability to evaluate my own setups within the context of the bigger picture. And Wab has the ability to explain things like Elliot Wave concept, overall market direction, which always has been a bit of a mystery to me, in a way that I can not only understand it but as also apply it to my own trading. And yes, I agree it takes a few reads and also some application/ exercise to fully understand. And it may be a bit advanced, but I am of the opinion that every trader need some of this "bigger picture" knowledge to be really successful in trading

When I trade I have an indicator that changes the background color. It is more for auto trading, enabling me to tell at a glance which direction my robot has taken a trade. I will discontinue its use here, as we do not need it. I will also just stick with only the 8 shift 5, smoothed median moving average (the red line in the Alligator), fractals and the AO. The main indicator is always going to be price, with the HH HL LL LH analysis revealing a potential E line. The current trend line that works with the BW fractal or the E line to form a BW Fork. Usually this matches with divergence on the AO. I realize that I have referred to other indicators: The MACD 5 34 5 which is nearly identical to the AO. De Mark lines, which you can basically determine yourself without the messy indicator cluttering up the chart. The Alligator, from which we only use the red Teeth line from. (8 shift 5, smoothed, median moving average.) I will keep charts white with only the AO, fractals and the Teeth moving average. I will be adding Fibonacci extension and retracement lines and explaining a lot more about those in due course. Trend lines are also essential in illustrating the E line, the BW hook and figure four trades. In the next chart, I have shown the last trade that I took before I was out of town. I closed it off at the 61.8% level because I could not be there to manage it. As you can see it would have easily made the 100.00% level. As we go along I will show you how to get the best out of a trade like that, instead of a mere 61.8% The chart shows divergence on the AO, a BW Fork and A Fib retracement. I also have the HH HL LL LH analysis as it was at the time. So here is some homework: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Continue the HH HL LL LH analysis and determine the next two trend reversals with BW Fork analysis. Check the AO carefully as you go for any divergence. By the way, the two moving average lines on the AO are a dodger blue 1 SMA and a black 5 EMA of the AO. You can add those if you like, but they are not essential. Do not worry about posting any solutions, I will do that and you can compare your efforts with mine. Please do the analysis before you look at the answers.

I hope that I have managed to answer most of the questions asked so far. I did not really refer to the HBF chart a lot, but I will get back to that. For now, I want to concentrate on the HH HL LL LH trend reversals and how to trade them. Eventually, I will combine the 10 pip bricks and the 30 pip bricks on one chart and provide a nice audio alert in the process. I have attached a template for the 10 pip Renko chart that should keep it simple, as requested by one or two people. Attached File(s) M2Teaching.tpl 2 KB | 354 downloads

Meanwhile, don't forget the Figure Four Trades. Here are some that were available and the one that I am currently in. I colored the potential trades A, B, C, and D and left the current one (E) in black. I didn't take any of the earlier ones as I was traveling. I also entered this one late but I figured it is good for some pips as it broke belwo the last fractal. So far, it is on its way to the Reward level, up 47 pips with 22 locked in. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Trade closed at the Reward Level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The diagonal line of each Four can be drawn from fractal to opposing fractal, wick to opposing fractal or occasionally from wick to wick. Renko Bricks are great for this. The trade I just took was taken late, I like to enter at the midpoint of the Four Diagonal fifty percent level on the Fib Expansion Tool as shown. However, a late entry can still be taken with confidence, as you have a good idea where themarket will go and can decide accordingly. I could also have gone for the extension target but I had to leave the trade to its own devices as I was busy doing other things. Being able to place a pending order and a predefined stop and stop loss are great when you have more things to do than just trade. When I cover the trailing stop opportunities in this type of trading you will see that there are ways to handle those situations, but we will continue to take little steps and master each before we move on. A trailing stop on the Teeth line would be very good here but I will leave that until later. I will come back and talk about that as this chart develops. You will have noticed that I do live trades here. If your teacher does not show you live trades and the rational behind them as they develop... move on. Hind-sight is easy. Doing it in real time is what separates the nuggets from the gravel.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Wab First thank you for the post and all the time you put into learning us this forex trading methode. english is not my native language so it takes some time to understand and slowly slowly it becomes clear. I have a small question about the entry of a trade when a "four signal" is formed. You say: "I like to enter at the midpoint of the Four Diagonal fifty percent level on the Fib Expansion Tool". I understand that... but when you look at the small fours in you're last example, it seems to me that the time to enter the trade at the midpoint of the Four Diagonal is very limited because you have to wait until the renko bar is completely formed. only then you know the price is moving in the right direction. In case of the small four's: if you wait for the renko bar to close, the midpoint of the Four Diagonal is already past. Can you please explain how you enter these trades? Do you place a pending order with a buy stop/sell stop? or do you wait till there is a "bigger four"? Thanks

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I like to enter on the 50% of the diagonal of the Four. However, as you have noticed, that is often not possible in smaller Fours. So you ask a very good question. If you use a fractal to fractal diagonal for the Four they are generally bigger. As the wick forms on the opposing fractal you get an advance clue. I place a pending order on the 50% level and adjust it as the diagonal of the Four develops. Start at the wick and adjust as the next wick in the opposite direction forms. On small Fours the 50% level can be hit with one brick, before you can actually place the trade there. (You can see on the last trade that I missed the 50% entry and still made money by trading the break out past the fractal as there was a good Reward Level to try for. So even with a missed 50% entry there is still a trade to be had.) We also have a one minute chart to look at. To date, I have not really talked about the M1 chart a lot. I will soon get around to explaining how I use it to time entries. Your question is a very good one and I will answer it in detail after I add two brick sizes to one chart. Let me do that next and then I promise to really open it up with some M1 discussion.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
OK. It is time to really ramp this up a notch (again.) I hope that this actually makes things more simple - though at first it may be confusing. I am going to show you how to add a second layer to any Renko Chart and also to the M1 chart. I hope this will start to answer Calcue's question and some previous questions about the 30 pip brick chart and its relationship to the 10 pip brick chart. Here is where they become one chart. I have attached a zip file with the Renko Shade 3 indicator and its sound files. You will have to find the sounds folder in your MT4 and copy the NBU and NBD wav files into it. Add the RenkoShade3 indicator to your M2 chart (the 10 pip brick chart) with these settings: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Your chart should look like this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have a trade going so you can check that out too. The divergence on the AO tells me we are changing direction I am not sure how this one will go so I will be cautions and maybe just take profit at the Flat level. I can't post for a while now as I have other things to do, so have some fun and see what a 30 on a 10 tells you. Don't forget to zoom way out. Also experiment with turning the 10 pip chart off by setting it to line display with no color in the lines display properties. Believe me, this combination of 30 and 10 on one chart is powerful. When we involve the M1 it is even more so.

Hi WAB, I have been absorbing your wonderful thread over the last few weeks and I am grateful and thrilled to find such well thought out strategy so clearly and easily explained. Thank you WAB and your fellow contributors. I finally believe I can see my way to success in this challenging forex trading. Cheers Alan.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Thanks Alan. It helps me a lot to explain things to others. They pick up on the things I am not totally clear on and force me to tighten up my strategy. There will be lots more ahead: First will use Renko Shade and M1/Renko Shade charts. Then, there is trade management and money management. I might even get into robots and Renko. I hope that traders step in and share their use of the method and support each others understanding of it.

Great thread Wab. Nice to be able to analyze charts that work even in the Asian session I trade. If like me you want to label your charts with HH, HL LL LH etc use the text button labelled with an "A" on your tool bar. Once you've applied them for the first time its easy to copy them by pressing your "Control" key whilst selecting the text you've used previously. Then just drop it over the next hi or lo you are labeling! Saves a bit of time. Blessings. Bat.

Hi, What is the name of the indicator on your chart that looks like Suns showing main trend direction change? Thanks

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Semafor. Be careful it will adjust itself with price. You'll find a copy here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...85#post8275085

Forexaz, the indicator is a semafor. I have attached a few for you to look at in a zipped file. Batavier may have one of these or a different one. Thanks for the heads up on the labels Batavier, that will be most helpful to people. I also find my schedule and time zone have me looking in the Asian session for trades. Renko moves independent of time and that is a help.

Hi Wab Thank you for the explanation and looking forward to more

hi wab I think you opened an order on the basis of the divergence , right? in your picture i dont see a divergence. http://prntscr.com/81id2v

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I want to remind everyone on the importance of the big picture. Too often we can get focused on an immediate trade and have no idea on how it fits in with the larger trends. Here is a way to deal with that. First of all, go to properties and set the line graph color to none. Attached Image Then set your Renko Shade 3 to show 30 pip bricks on the 10 pip brick chart. Zoom out as far as you can and then display a line graph. (The template that I made available a few posts back is set up for this.) You should now get a chart that looks like this ... of course you have to add the HH HL LL LH labels. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You now have the Big Picture and know well ahead of time where to expect the market to give you some great action. Look where price would break below the last LL and confirm the LH? Now turn the candles back on and you can play the 10 pip bricks within the 30 pip brick structure. One other thing, note the crossover of the Teeth line when the bricks change color. That alone is a really powerful and useful feature.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
When the Renko Shade takes a long time to form a new bar......could be consolidation or possible trend change as with the AUD/USD just now. Of course lots of USA data coming out tonight - that's probably the culprit.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Good observation Batavier. The Renko Shade actually reveals the time it takes for a Renko Brick to form. We use Renko to get away form time but there it is anyway. Now here is a hint: Also put the Renko Shade on the M1 chart that you use to generate the Renko 10 pip brick chart. Set it to a Ten pip Brick size. Now you can see how the M1 and the 10 pip Renko chart interact. You will note how long it takes for a brick to form and how that shows a sideways market or a trending market. The same principle of HH HL LL LH applies in the M1 chart (use fractals.) When you get a wick developing on the 10 pip bricks, the M1 HH HL LL LH gives a microscopic view of what is happening inside that wick. I will see about some M1 chart examples later on. The Renko Shade 3 also gives you a nice voice alert when a new brick forms. I Love voice alerts. A series of "new brick up" (or "down") messages coming close together is very exciting -especially if you are in the trade in the correct direction. I particularly enjoy hearing my computer telling me I just made another ten pips, while doing some other activity. My wife calls it the talking cash register.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I missed this mornings trade marked with the ellipse. There was a BW Fractal below the 8MA and divergence though the LH was only marked by a small fractal not a 5 bar one. Would have been a great trade. Hopefully a new LH, LL sequence will start.

Meanwhile, here is my take on the 10 pip AUDUSD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have a buy stop at the level which is basically the neck line of an inverted head and shoulders. I will let LOC manage the trade. (LOC is a commercial product which I use. I am not affiliated with it at all, just a happy user.)

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Wab I've been practicing drawing Forks (white lines). To use the vernacular they gave some forking good signals! Combine them with the AO and Renko shade for confirmation they are terrific!! I will now use them regularly!!

--- 帖子 #393 ---
If like me you like reading things on paper and cutting down trees and supporting the printer ink industry this may be of use to you. Thanks Wab you are opening our eyes to market structure in a simple way. Keep up the great work!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I think I'm in love. That first swing on the new trend and the fibo!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wab may your prospecting pan be filled with gold nuggets.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
And one more to finish my day. Exit at 61.8 due needing to do other things and AO looks very rangy at this time.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Batavier, Thanks for all your contributions here. I see you are using median renko bars. Is there any specific reasons you prefer them over normal renko's? Also I see you use 5 pips box size on your median renko, any specific reason for that? Thanks

--- 帖子 #397 ---
is this good? its 10 pip bricks http://prntscr.com/8485xe

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Mor. I use median renko bars as they give nice smooth movement of price. I also have standard Renko charts but the median Renkos allow me to see the signal a little earlier. Particularly I pay attention to the wicks as fractals often form there. The reason I choose 5 pip was that after some experimenting that seemed best to fit with the AUD/USD and give signals I could use during the Asian session when I can trade. Read all that Wab has posted this thread is not long or complicated. It's pure gold!!

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi Eurix. I took the liberty of re-posting your chart. Looks like you nailed it. It may go higher with a divergence forming on the AO but take the cash and let the credit go never fails. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pretty soon I will talk about how I use the M1 chart and the Renko Shade to give an X ray vision of what is going on inside those bricks. I didn't find any nuggets on this trip Batavier. The creek I am prospecting carries very fine gold and garnets and I am trying to trace either to a source. The bush here is very dry and the fire hazard is extreme - so I wasn't too ambitious. It seems like you found plenty of nuggets in that AUDUSD chart though. Between the Initial Fibo and the fours, life can be grand indeed.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thanks Batavier for your reply. Regards

Yesterday I didn't trade as I wanted to see how the AUD/USD reacted after the weekend (and my own lack of confidence). It opened with no gap and continued to move down with a few possible signals. One of the 50% fib and two trend line breaks with AO on the down side giving confirmation. All ended at the 61.8% Fib level. Nice.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Well this morning was another sit aside morning. Monetary policy minutes came out so not sure what to do. There was a BW fractal which I spotted in hindsight, if taken it went to the 61.85 extension.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
The only other way to have handled to-days mess would be to reduce the Renko brick size. That would have given me some nice trades. Hohum. Thinking.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Update to post 402. Patience was all that was needed. Gave a wonderful sell signal just before Frankfurt opened. Pullback to the 38.2 and lovely extension to 61.8. Then second pullback to the 23.6 which extended to the 100% level. Its amazing how pulling the fib to the first confirmed LL after a HH works. Should rename it as "The Controlling Fib" because it does until the trend changes.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thanks for those great charts Batavier. It is most gratifying to see someone else use an idea that you have worked with and also use it well. I am working on testing an ea that will really help with figure four entries and I hope to post it here as soon as I am happy with it. Keep up the good work.

Today I feel confused. My bigger block size chart says possible up sequence AO on up side. My smaller block size says possible down sequence AO on down side. Don't feel like the planets are aligned today.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
At a glance, I would say that your M2 and M3 chart are in a wave two. Draw the master Fib on the M3 chart from the last LL to the HH. then draw it on the same extremes on the M2 chart from the lowest LL to the last HH. That wave has five internal waves and that makes me think it is an impulse, likely a wave one. So, I think that you are now in a wave two ABC pattern, with A and B done and C underway. Wave two should usually correct back to the 61.8 to 76% area. When it gets down to that area, or gives a solid reversal pattern, or both, then think of longs again. AO should also show a bullish divergence. It may not go as deep as that, so also watch 50%. We don't know how far it will drop until it reverses but the Fib levels give us possible reversal levels. If this is the first pullback on the M3 then look for a big up move coming up. Wave three or C. Check that M3 master Fib for targets. Trading inside a correction is always tough going - especially in a wave four. I have been fine-tuning some stuff and will start to post it in a day or two. I think that you will probably enjoy being able to fire off a trade manager to handle a lot of the entries. So, I am going to hold off on the one minute stuff for a bit until I am happier with my explanation of it. My focus is simplicity and that is difficult enough to achieve. Some homework: Go to YouTube and watch this video: Inserted Video If anyone is fluent in Russian, feel free to jump in. This ea is something that we may use, but I am unsure about its status. Is it free to download, or is it commercial? I have another ea to do the same thing but this is a really neat product and much less complex than the alternative. If anyone can determine its status please advise. I don't want to high jack anyone's work and deny them any credit due. If it is free to use you are going to love it.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thanks for your advice re reading the charts. The market had other ideas though. Big down move. I was stopped out. Plenty more trades to come. Trailing pending stop order sounds great. That way you can get in early at each swing!! Love the idea. However I checked afterburner on myfxbook. Seems that method has some big drawdowns - like 40%??

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Not russian - polish. And no download on the site. Asked owner of the site and waiting.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Wow. Thanks Krystyn, you are a Godsend. I hope we can use that ea. I have another that will do the same thing, but it is far more complex. I used it overnight with great results. Charts to follow.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi all Perhaps this ea helps too. Test your needs.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks Kofix11 for that ea. I will test it asap. We are developing a real community of helpful people here. Nice. Now, as promised, some material on how things work and how to take advantage of it. First of all market structure - as always. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The first chart shows a typical HH HL LL LH sequence with some trend reversals. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The second chart shows the same structure with the bricks that are responsible for it. Now, we add the (red) E lines to the first chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Add finally the (red) E lines on the brick chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is an explanation of why we look at a color change in the brick pattern as a trend reversal pattern. It is a bit of overkill perhaps, but if you look inside every color change reversal pattern it shows you that there is a trend reversal occurring. You can change to a LBF to find the details of the trend reversal and that is why I use the two brick frames (30 and 10) for analysis. Now how do we take advantage of it?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
When we try for an entry on a figure four, the default is the 50% level of the oblique line. Calcu asked a question about the entry on short retraces and that made me want to explain how to handle the Figure Four entries, rather than just waiting for them. (If you have waited for a few then you will be ready for this.) I did not want to add too much, too fast, as it all takes time to digest. I don't like sitting around waiting for things to happen, so this is a strategy to avoid that. First, make sure from the HH HL LL LH analysis that you know which way the trend is going. I will use a bullish trend for my example. The master Fib (Batavier gets the credit for its name.) has been established and therefore we are going to trade a Figure Four off of a bearish counter trend. Our counter trend starts with a brick that has a large upwards wick and a change of color - green to red in this case. Momentum is above the red line and a retrace of price is imminent. AC is red and AO should follow it into a down turn. Price has surged up and through the 200 Fib level so all the stars are aligning. I placed a buy stop just above the top of the wick. I don't really want to buy there though. I want to buy as close to the next bullish reversal pattern as I can. So I need something to move my buy stop down as the counter trend reversal moves down. Now a reversal in a ten pip brick chart (to my way of thinking) is two bricks and a pip - 210 points. So I set my trailing buy stop to be triggered by a 210 point rally in price. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The ea (the one that we hope to be able to use) begins to move the buy stop down keeping it 210 points above the extreme of the lowest brick. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The trailing buy stop is triggered 210 points above the extreme low of the last bearish candle. You can see how the ea moved the price down and down (arrow by arrow) to achieve this. The 161.8 fib level also shows its influence here. Always watch the Fibs. A red, dotted, trailing stop level, set to trail 210 points behind the highest part of the bullish brick is also shown. (more on that later.) So how does it all end? I took a counter trend trade starting at a wick that suggests a drop back towards the red line. I used an ea to move a buy stop down tick by tick until it was triggered buy a reversal of 210 points. I then trailed a 210 point trailing stop and ... I went to bed. I awoke at 5:00 a.m. (my time) to take a screen shot and went back to sleep. (Drink lots of water before you go to sleep and you are guaranteed an early morning check on the charts.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) It all worked while I slept. 70.5 pips. Here is the Figure Four on this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A 50% entry may also leave a good portion of the available trade unused on a deep retrace and this helps with that too. IN this example we entered pretty much on the 50% oblique level. An entry on a long retrace adds valuable pips that our standard 50% entry misses. Some thoughts: Our system is getting a bit more complex, but it is still HH HL LL LH in all respects - I will add a few helpers and some trade assistants to help manage what we should now understand about market structure. Do I always get these correct? No. But the casino doesn't always win either and they make money steadily. I believe this system gives us an edge. Practice helps a lot. Screen time and persistence adds up. Then there is the trailing stop and that purple line that you may have noticed on the charts. We will get to those in due course. Money management and automation strategies are ahead. The trailing buy stop and the trailing stop loss can be dealt with in a variety of ways. Each requires explanations and time to fit it into the big picture. I hope that the draw down question on the trailing buy stop was also answered. I will check sleeptight and see if it is suitable for this sort of trade and I invite you to test it as well and report back to the group. Many hands make light work. I will also ask for any good trailing stop eas that people may have that are free. Specifically one that we can set the distance to 210 points. I use LOC but it is not free and I will not/cannot share it. I have another but it requires testing. Meanwhile I will wait and see what Krystyn finds out about TPSO and if I can share it and we can all use it. Lots to think about on these last two posts. Have fun.

For those of you who spend long hours staring at screens, I've found this template to be easiest on my eyes. !! AA Animal Farm Eyesaver Basic.tpl I also use the #4X 3 semafor alert.ex4 a lot as it helps me to see the important fractals quickly. (Not 100% you still need to look carefully at all price structure.) You could even trade just using the semafor - wait for a sunrise or sunset then trade the next fractal in that direction (white = up red = down). Anchor your master fib to the sun and the first semafor fractal and look at the beautiful extensions. The semafor is just based on the old zigzag of three differing sizes (so like the zigzag it will keep on moving with price - just as it should, it's not a crystal ball!) Renko charts of course - I use the mean Renko. Also included an old PDF :" the Amazing Magic of Now" very much in line with Wabs post 413 and understanding the fractal nature of the market. Blessings to all. Bat

I am not up to much posting tonight. We had a lightning storm that blew up a power pole and put us in the dark for five hours. I had a nice trade running and my connection to that broker is still not working. Fortunately, my stops were in place and a profit was locked in. Trades are like buses - another one will come along soon enough. I will try to answer questions about LOC tomorrow. It is a great tool but can be tricky to set up. No feed back from the Polish programmer of TPSO and I haven't had time to look at sleeptight yet. Thanks to Batavier for posting his template and Semaphore. I puzzled over the Amazing Magic material a while back and eventually developed my own understanding of structure as shared here. I do believe that if you look enough and keep an open mind, you will find what you are looking for. I have heard that build 851 is problematic. More information here if you have upgraded to it and need to deal with it: http://ovo.cz/avoid-mt4-build-851/

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Here are some X bar back settings for LOC trailing. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Initial stop is set to 21. You can use a bigger one ... your choice. Trailing stop is set to 2 bricks back plus a pip (basically 210 points on a ten pip brick chart.) This setting works with any brick size. Renko is particularity good with an X bars trailing stop because it allows us to have a nice predicable point at which to place the stop. A color reversal in the bricks is confirmed precisely at two bars and a pip. Two bars and a pip back is an excellent trailing stop. Note: You have to click on the Trailing method options to see all the setting numbers. Set it to 4 for X bars. I also use a different LOC version, one that allows me to take a partial profit after the price moves a set number of pips. LOC is a commercial product - so please don't ask me for a copy. Do a search and check it out. In my opinion spending a few dollars to purchase an ea that ultimately helps you make money is good for you and good for the people that spend hours and hours developing the ea. Disclaimer: I am not an associate of LOC in any way, just a happy user of their products.

I didn't receive any answer from the programmer of TPSO but in the meantime found similar ea's here on FF: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=468993 - very simple and http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=405694 - simple but with mm

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Wow. You rock Krystyn. After I found TPSO (and it was big search involving Google Translator and much puzzling on my part.) I didn't look for any other eas to do the same job. My research went in a different direction. I found another way to do the same thing. I look forward to testing these and invite anyone on the thread to do so as well and let us know how they perform. Big round of applause to Krystyn.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Let's have a look at some fours. All of which could be traded by using a trailing pending stop order. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you examine the chart you will see that not all fours are equal. Every one of them will give you a profit if taken at the flat level. Inverted fours, numbers 1 to 6 on this chart, all meet their reward target level, or even more if a trailing stop is used. (Two bars a pip back.) However the A,B,C,D fours are taken in a counter trend and only A and B make their reward target level. C and D only meet the flat level - maybe a bit more on a trailing stop if you are lucky. When we look at the relationship between the red and violet lines (Teeth on the Ten pip and Teeth on the 30 pip)we can see that as long as the lines diverge we are in an impulse wave. When they converge we are in a corrective wave. Corrective waves are messy and overlap a lot. Hard to trade but not impossible, as the A B C D fours show. If you have studied Bill Williams' material, you will also know that when the AO heads back to the zero line that shows a corrective wave is under way. In this chart I placed ellipses on the AO when it is showing an impulse is under way. When the red and violet lines are diverging, fours are strong trades. Witnessed by numbers 1 -6. They are strong because they are in sync with the dominant HH HL LL LH count.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Now, let's look at the same chart on the thirty pip brick frame. Our analysis method is identical. We look for E lines or BW fractals and BWF hooks. That gives us the big picture and the dominant trend on the HBF. (Higher Brick Frame.) In particular, I now want to focus on the thirty-pip-bricks counter trend on the right, where I have drawn an inverted four, using the customized Fibonacci Expansion tool. Our Four reward target is above the Master Fib 61.8 sweet zone and it looks as if the 100.00 % level is likely to be hit next. This is all nice. We can even trail a stop 2 bricks and a pip back (610 points) and relax. We are up 268.3 pips in matter of a couple of days. Lovely. On the 30 pip bricks our initial stop would be 610 points (two bricks and a pip) and we again trail two bricks and a pip back. Now lets be really sneaky here... pay close attention. I am giving you the keys to the kingdom. If we had been monitoring that corrective wave on the ten pip chart and comparing it to the thirty pip chart, we would have seen the price on the ten pip dips below the violet line then starts to rise back through the red line. I placed an ellipse on that event and a corresponding ellipse on the thirty pip chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now this point is very important - pay attention and really think it through: If you had taken a trade on the Ten pip chart ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) you could have your 210 point stop and get in really early on that thirty pip chart as the dominant trend reasserts itself. At this point you are in for the same two day run (so far) and have risked a mere 21 pips to get 345 pips or so ... and it is still going! That is a 16.5 to 1 RR ratio. You could also have entered on the ten pip brick figure fours and just have a ball on that big thirty brick run. Summary: When you see a big correction on the 30 pip bricks, a 30 pip figure four in progress, try to enter on the ten pip bricks. Get in early on the move and Ride Sally Ride. So far, I have kept this to ten and thirty brick charts because the Fibonacci Ratios (3:1) work well. The two brick frame teeth lines also work out nicely there. Batavier already uses different brick ratios but finds that the HH HL LL LH sequence, BW fractals and E lines prove to be universal. He trades the Asian session and has adapted his charts to effectively handle more appropriate brick sizes for that market. Size doesn't matter. Try what ever brick sizes you are comfortable with, but keep the larger trend in mind and work inside of that trend on the lower brick frame for entries. Find a balance between your two brick frames that works for you. You should also be able to think through when it is appropriate to change back down to the LBF for exits, but that is enough to think about today.

Hi Wab, What is the length of the purple ma you show on the 10 brick chart? Thanks for all your guidance and insights. I appreciate it. WGT

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Attached Image Remember this works on the ten thirty ratio. If you use different size bricks you will have to figure out an appropriate relationship between them. 13, 21 may be a good ratio for smaller bricks. I haven't checked. If anyone finds a good ratio on smaller brick pairs, please post it for the group to look at Note all of the Fibonacci numbers at work in this. Fib series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ... etc. Alligator averages: 5,3 8,5 13,8 Somewhere, I have a spreadsheet that shows how any two numbers will produce a steady 1.618 ratio. If you don't believe that Fibonacci is integral in the market charts you will soon wish that you did earlier.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks Wab for the help. That clears things up a bit. ;-) WGT

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Here it is (spreadsheet attached.) Place any two numbers you like into the first two cells of the spreadsheet (456 and 99 are the current ones.) The spreadsheet will take the sum of those two numbers and divide it by the second number. After it repeats this a few times you will notice the ratio on the right hand side looks very familiar to anyone who has ever done anything with Fibonacci. I found this idea in a book by Joe Duffy and wrote the spreadsheet to test what he was saying. Try it. Any two numbers will produce a 1.618 ratio after a few iterations. So will any two prices somehow do a similar thing? People say that Fibonacci levels are hit because they become a self-fulfilling prophecy. That would suggest that millions of traders accurately calculate them and trade towards them. I doubt that a fraction of traders use them and even less traders use them correctly. If you study charts, especially Elliott Wave, you will see them again and again. Uncanny how all those traders coordinate that. What we are doing here is very Elliott Wave without all the complexity involved in wave counting, all the alternative counts, wave degrees, rules and so forth. KISS as much as possible.

Hello! I hope you can help me with this issue: When my MT4 is open and it's running, RENKO charts (based on H4 and M6) are quite fine and RENKO bars are being generated. In order to make my own system and strategy, I have added RSI and STOCHASTIC oscillators to the chart. Up to this point, everything is going fine and renko chart is being generated according to the price movements. Let me say that this goes on for a full day long! After that, when I close MT4 and re-open it, the chart shape is totally different. Before closing MT4 and re-opening it, candles are not as beautiful as candles that I see after re-opening the MT4. This also happens to the oscillators. Please look at these photos: 1: Photo 1 (before closing MT4, running for a few hours): http://tinypic.com/r/auguoj/8 2: Photo 2 (After closing and re-opening MT4 with a few seconds delay): http://tinypic.com/r/iok8j6/8 I would like to know your opinions about this and let me solve this myth! Thanks a lot.

Please excuse my spaghetti factory of variable moving averages (I'm working on something else here to see the waves). But just check out the BF fork configuration (Using the E line) on the AUD/USD; using those lines and the Master Fib anchor from LL to first HH or HH to first LL they all 5 of them extend at least to the 161.8% Fib level. I never used to believe or understand Fib levels but this is really getting exciting!!! (having said that the gnomes in Zurich will now do something tricky I'm sure but I'm wearing my aluminum hat so they can't read my brainwaves.....Just kidding.) Now I just need to get enough time to be at my computer at the right moment! Waiting for today's fork to confirm itself before I have to go elsewhere On further reflection if the above holds true it also means that I now have a directional bias for the next series of trades at least until the 161.8% extension level (of that first wave) has been reached and also a price target. Can all this be true or am I dreaming? Or is this just part of one of those Elliot waves Wab speaks of? I need to go do some more back testing.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Base it on m1 not h4

What did I do now to upset those gnomes? I went to sleep and the Gnomes went crazy because I thought I could make a market forecast. Maybe that hat was not such a bad idea. Big lesson - expect the unexpected.

hi batavier i am a bit confused, but the HL that i market with a black circle on your chart. i think this is not a confirmed HL because there is after no HH only a LH (yellow). so must the E line not be that black line i drawn in your chart? If i am wrong please correct me. this is the point where i always struggle. thank you for your effort. and sorry for my english Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi Eurix. Well spotted. Yes, you are quite correct it is not a confirmed HL. I was using it as a BW Fractal instead (first fractal to break through the teeth line) You will note from Wab's posts that either method is acceptable (when seeking entries), I restarted my wave pattern from there. Indeed both entry levels worked out nicely and if using the master Fib both extended to the 161.8% target level.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
This afternoons trade. Late entry and early exit off the 100% bounce. But you can see the 161.8% extension was easily hit.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
""You will note from Wab's posts that either method is acceptable (when seeking entries)"" i have probably overlooked that. thank you.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Batavier, Sorry to be a nuisance, could you please let me know which Renko chart you are using, and if you could let me know where I could download it. I have tried to compare my Renko with yours, but they are not the same. Your charts are very informative and I'm trying to learn from them, having the same chart would certainly help. Thanking you in advance.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Here area couple of articles on the reversal pattern we are using. I found these when I was trying to understand the HH HL LL LH reversal patterns and looking for an indicator that would identify them - preferably with an alert. I did not find one that I liked. The 5-0 harmonic pattern was as close as I could find but it misses so many of the patterns it is poor at best. It is a case of we become the indicator. Anyhow, you can read these two articles and may gain some insight from them.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Dene, I use mean Renko chart set to 25 the Renko generator is from Ovo (I DO NOT REPRESENT or have affiliation with THIS COMPANY I just like their product). Just Google them and you'll find what you need. My template is on post 415. Hope this helps. Bat.

Similar setup here for scalping. Essentially price action with a bit of help. First we have a range chart then we have a one minute chart. Both have the same things applied. We see supply and demand levels, fractals for higher highs and lower lows, DeMark trendlines based on the fractals, and Bollinger bands to show how far away from he mean price is.

Well today's trade was an exercise in frustration. What a mess of a chart. Out at BE+1. Entered between the BWCRL and the standard CRL Better than a loss. Bring on tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Can't seem to pick them at the moment. Changed to the AUD/JPY from A/U after yesterdays frustration. Got a nice entry using a limit order below the CRL. Manually trailed the stop at the fractals. Exit at 4 pips. Next trade please!

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Batavier have you read Bill Williams books on how to use the AO to count Elliott Waves? A wave four goes sideways to down in a triangle usually. The AO has a divergence and then heads to the zero line or lower when that happens. The whole process gets difficult to unravel when that happens. As far as I can see your count is correct and should swing back to HH HL now. Always check what the HBF is telling you. Trade in the direction it is showing. At some point we may get to Robotic trading and being in sync with the HBF is the only way that I have had that work out. My apologies to other people who have asked me to look over counts. I will try to find time to post a bunch of them, review the process and give you some practice examples.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Cool thanks Wab. No I haven't read Bill Wiliams book. Will get a copy. Been a busy day and I've had to come and go from my computer a few times. Here's my last trade on the AUD/JPY. Late entry but looked like heading the right direction. (I checked the bars on a 1 hour chart.)I chased the Renko bars down with my SL. 9.5 pips on this one. Time to go do some other work. No more trades today.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Bill Williams has three books. "Trading Chaos," is great for understanding EW theory. Especially Chapter Seven. His second one, "New Trading Dimensions," is excellent. He explains the AO AC and Alligator there. Some people say his stuff is dated but I see many people who talk about Elliott Wave and so forth without the slightest clues. HH HL LL LH is very Elliott Wave but without all the techy stuff. I will try and put together some charts that will help you with the dreaded wave four corrections that tend to cause us all grief. A question for you about the semaphore indicator that you use. Does it slow your computer down? I was tinkering with it today and it made my machine bog. Maybe I was on too low a time frame ?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Wab, Re semafor "A question for you about the semaphore indicator that you use. Does it slow your computer down? I was tinkering with it today and it made my machine bog. Maybe I was on too low a time frame ?" Yes if I use it on many charts at the same time it does slow down my system.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Wab if you're playing with the semafor set it as follows : Period 1 to 0 Period 2 to 0 Period 3 to 21 Only use the stars to draw your lines and presto look at my picture! Am I getting close???? OR Period 1 to 3 Period 2 to 5 Period 3 t0 21 for all the useful fractals.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Wab Alternatively try this little indi, I found in my files, does the same thing. (I can't remember where I got it from)

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Semaphore is 3x zigzag which calculates conditions every tick. So it's nature is to eat your computer resources. Maybe there is somewhere a version that makes it's calculations after candle is closed.

We must travel in the same circles. I also have all of those indicators. That free ATM swing is a nice zigzag and I use it on occasion. See chart below. I find that good indicators confirm what I can see anyway and most others are lagging. I prefer to be the indicator and let the chart tell me what it is doing. The chart never lies, though sometimes it is hard to listen to. Especially if you have too much noise from too many indicators telling you different stories about what happened in the past. As an aside; last night while I was looking for some good charts to do some HH HL LL LH analysis with, I took this trade. The chart had just made a correction upwards against the trend and changed brick colors back towards the trend. I did the Figure Four and went short. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I trailed a stop one pip above the green Alligator line and went to bed. I had a nice (profitable) sleep and the trade closed shortly after I started writing this. 87.8 pips. Have a look at that chart and see how many Figure Fours formed against that trend. No additional indicators needed really, just a standard eyeball on the Renko and our red Teeth line. You may also note a square that I placed on the chart, and here is where I find some indicators handy. (The three Alligator lines and the HBF, 30 pip bricks Teeth line.) Note that inside the rectangle is the only time that they all the moving averages are squeezed in between two opposing fractals. (The previous down fractal is also a Bill Williams fractal which is something we understand already.) Now go and look at a some charts and see how often you can find a set of of fractals where the three Alligator lines are squeezed between two opposing fractals. If the 30 brick teeth line is in there as well, so much the better. Hint: There is an Alligator Squeeze where the three Alligator lines were forced between two opposing fractals on the chart, above my Figure Four. Start by finding that one. Keep an eye our for BW fractals and the Teeth line while you are at it. I am going to prepare some homework for you on this, HH HL LL LH counts and wave four. It will be a day or two. Again thanks for the feedback and the various indicators for testing. And yes ... here is the Alligator squeeze that you were looking for above that Figure Four Trade.

Hello Wab (and all), I've discovered this thread a few days back, which made me very happy as I love Renko. I've started with the rebooted system but very quickly found out I lack more knowledge so I'm back at the beginning but could contain myself from saying Thanks! On with my silent reading.

Thanks Rea. Good trading to you.

Here is a little exercise that you can do with any chart where you are having trouble getting the HH HL LL LH count correct. In the first chart I have a 10 pip brick display and I have done a quick count of the larger structure. The red lines show the important fractals that I identified as the larger brick frame LL locations. I did not worry about the internal sequence of hh hl ll lh . (Pardon me if I re-invent Elliott wave structure here and talk about degrees of waves and internal waves.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) With a bit of experience you can macro analyze any chart in this manner and get the feel for the dominant trend very quickly. You will note that I left a question mark at the end of the chart at the point that may become a new LH. We don't know that until it is confirmed by price dropping below the last LL. Now I can hear you saying this is difficult, so here is how you confirm this macro count in a second. Leave your lines on the chart and change it to a 30 pip brick chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If your macro count was correct (it will be with practice) then the stars will also align perfectly on the 30 pip bricks. This is a good way to learn how to do the HBF HH HL LL LH on a lower brick frame. Now how is it useful? You will note that inside each macro wave there are numerous waves of a lower degree (God Bless Elliot) which we can now count away in confidence. At every macro turn in the count, look for a HH HL LL LH reversal pattern, a BW Fractal or a BW Fork - the usual suspects. If you can't see them, a smaller brick frame often reveals them. The reversal pattern that I illustrated at the top of the move is a good example of what often shows up. Knowing the internal structure is supported by the macro analysis really helps. (By the way this pretty much covers a lot of the degrees of Elliott Wave stuff. It makes Elliott Wave a lot easier to study when you understand this.) You may also notice that moves that are in sync with the trend direction, tend to not have a lot of overlaps. Whereas moves against the trend, tend to have more overlaps. (More Elliott.) Now add a control fib into the mix and have fun. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Wab could you please expend on this: "You may also notice that moves that are in sync with the trend direction, tend to not have a lot of overlaps. Whereas moves against the trend, tend to have more overlaps. (More Elliott.)" What do you mean with overlaps? Regards Bat

Hello everyone, dear Wab thank you for post this exercize. I still encouter some difficult to understand some stuff, for example. In the first immage do you start with an HH, my first question is how we can understand and start with the good point ? i Give you an example, in this pic, found some post ago you start with an LH ( click here for see the immage ) about my actual knowledge for me it was an HH. Same in your last picture of AUD/USD ( click for see the immage ) for me the first was an LH. About myself I have first to fix this kind of stuff before enter on the deeper part of the topic, i know i'm late and sorry if i will brought the thread to older part of it (older member don't hate me lol) UPDATE: Hello everyone, i hate the spam so i prefer update my last post. I've got a problem on chart, look this printscreen, you can see the AO is not complete, and Alligator too have some problem on the left side of chart. Pair with problem are : EU-GU-AU-UJ all of this are M3 (thats mean 30 box size). My renko generator il Renkolivechart 3.4, any of you already got this problem too? (i already change the renko generator see below) I've got problem with @ sx BT set and get crosses too the cross dosen't move and they look stuck with the background, i already try to change renko generator like renkolivecharts_pimped_v4_13 but problem was the same. Thank's everyone in advance ! H.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hyperfire, in both cases the chart is cut off to the left. I used what was available on screen for an example. In the last exercise I zoomed out as far as I could and used what I could see for analysis, always wise to do this as much as possible. Your AO and AC require some data before they start to calculate and display. They are based on moving averages. If you can set your Renko to have more bars that problem should be solved. Get cross and Set Cross require that you zoom way out to find the pink vertical time line. On Get Cross it sometimes is off the screen. If you select objects list you will find a vertical line called BT_Time. You can select Edit and change its parameters to the time of the most recent data, visible at the bottom of your chart. That will move the vertical line into the correct place and you should be able to go from there. The pink lines are the ones that you want to adjust, move them and the blue lines on the other chart move to the same place on the other chart. Hope that helps.

In Elliott Wave Theory the are two types of waves, Impulse (Motive) waves and Corrective waves. You can read up on the topic in numerous places. Basically an impulse wave moves strongly in one direction like a zigzag flight of stairs. Renko charts have that appearance in any sustained move in the dominant direction of the trend. The wicks will all trail away opposite to the direction of the move, like tails on a comet. Corrective waves tend to overlap, chopping back and forth and not really getting too far in the process. The wicks will often point both ways in confusion from brick to brick. Elliott Wave is a complex subject which I try and simplify here, just touching on the basics. Bill Williams' first book "Trading Chaos " explains it very well in Chapter Seven. You may also want to look over http://www.elliottwave.net/education...ts/basics2.htm Sufficient to say that when we are in the direction of the trend, the chart will move well. When we are counter trend it will get messy. More than that is really not needed if we try to keep it simple (KISS) although the study of Elliott Wave is endlessly fascinating.

Thanks Mor. The more you learn about the Fibonacci stuff the better. It has been a busy week or so, I think that there is a lot to digest here so far, so I haven't added new material for a bit. I will soon see about some rewards for those of you that have come this far. The best yet, in my opinion. However, I am pretty much tied up with family stuff for a few days.

Hi, I've read nearly all of the thread and while I thank Wab (and all) for this knowledge, I also fund myself very frustrated. Everyone seems to plot the HH/HL/LL/LH signals but I'm getting it all wrong, buying the highs, selling the lows and generally getting caught up in micro trends where I'm getting stopped out. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi Rea. Maybe this will help a bit: Start with a 30 pip chart, zoom out so that you have either a prominent high or low, then use the red line as a boundary. Connect each pair of bricks that have opposing wicks that are at extremes, as you cross over and back on the red line. Don't try to do any analysis, just relax and go from one extreme to the other as you cross the red line and join the opposing wicks The first chart is the recent 30 pip bricks USDCHF. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now change the chart to a 10 pip brick chart. The 30 pip waves will still be visible. Use a different color (I used purple) and repeat the exercise joining the extremes of the opposing wicks again. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I zoomed in a bit here to makes sure you can see it better. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You now have two degrees of waves to examine. There are even smaller waves inside of the purple ones, but don't worry about them at this point. Once you have the larger waves (black) and the internal waves (purple) try your HH HL LL LH counts on each, bearing in mind that there is a black structure with an internal purple structure. Sometimes they will overlap and share a wave. The internal structure can have an occasional zigzag type of reversal, that stops after a brief probe against the bigger trend and then continues in the direction of the larger structure. You will find that those throw you off but the bigger structure asserts itself and off it goes again I hope that this exercise helps. Remember, draw the lines in relaxed frame of mind and only then try to figure out the sequence. Most of us try to do it the other way around. When you are relaxed it becomes an art exercise and it reveals itself better when you switch to the analytical side. People who are really left brained (strongly right handed) find this visual stuff difficult. I hope that helps. It can be a bit like not seeing the forest for the trees. Zoom out before you start, it is very important to get the big picture before you start. Good luck.

Hi Wab, Thank you for the explanation, I took the liberty of not quoting your post since it was long, I hope that's OK with you. I'm attaching my two charts, one with 30 pips bricks and one with 10 pips bricks. On the 10 chart, I have drawn in yellow what I think would be an only buy zones, in cyan, an only sell zone and in red, where I would have lost it. I'm also not entirely sure if the cyan ellipse wouldn't have been a killer for me. I'm also not sure if we're heading for an up trend or if the current high on the 30 chart is a LH and we're headed towards a new LL. Did I draw everything correctly? Thank you very much for your help.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hi Rea. You are getting the hang of it. Your ellipses that are tilted up, from left to right, are showing the impulse waves and the ones that are tilted to the down to the right, show the corrective waves. It gets confusing because you will just about always find both kinds of waves on a smaller scale inside each ellipse. Here is another look at the same chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Use the AO and the BW fractal (First fractal above the red line, or a subsequent one closer to the red line as shown.) When the AO is above zero we expect impulse waves where it is green and corrective waves as it heads back to zero. I placed vertical Aqua blue liens to emphasis the relationship between AO and the chart structure. Check the color change on AO its divergences and the above or below zero status. A divergence that is weak is noted. AO tells you a lot when you get familiar with it. The BW fractal and or a HH confirmation, is where I would be ready to enter. Red up arrows show the price levels and price confirms those later and takes you in on a pending order. I also added dotted black vertical lines that show you where the price has moved back through the red line. If you are still in a trade when this happens that is a heads up to exit. You are making good progress. I suggest lots of chart practice and you will gain your unique awareness of this. Mostly concentrate on one pair at first and you will get in tune with it. Bill Williams says that we do not trade the market we trade our belief system, or our understanding of the market.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Wab, Thank you. It is not getting clearer . What I'm saying, is, that looking at the chart, I can identify the HH, LL, LH and HL quite easily, the problem is what to do next. Most of the time it's like "OK, this is a fractal, it's above the teeth,price breaks down to form another HL, and then it "should" break above the former fractal and verify it as a HH or continue down as a reversal", needless to say overly exited me places a pending order above the would be HH when price is nearing it, the price touches the pending order or actually go a bar or two, sometimes even several bars up and then.... yup, you guessed it. Comes crushing down and I'm getting stopped out, or dismiss my stop(s) only to find the trend has been reversed and my loss is bigger then expected, dealing with it as a new down trend only to discover it was a micro trend that swoops up again and me? Well, I'm like that dog you've mentioned earlier, only I didn't catch that car, it stopped and reversed on me. As a side note, since you've mentioned it earlier, I was born right handed, at a certain time in my life I had to use my left arm more, then use both arms and am back at using my right arm more but not exclusively, so fun times R-Us Thank you for explaining. Would you say I should treat the 30 pips fractal lines as trend lines and only trade in their direction? Does it mean the last trade, as it's being reversed, would be a loss? Why the 30 pips, then? why not bigger bars or use ATR (the pimped renko EA has this feature) to calculate the brick sizes? Thank you again for all your help on this. It feels like it's within my grasp but still elusive. [EDIT] Wab, what happens when the 30 bricks have not yet settled in? Like now in AUDCHF, I mean, if I wait for a decisive move on the 30, I'll loose a lot of trade opportunities on the 10 bricks, no? I would have asked why not simply trade the 30 bricks but then I'll just be facing the "how to trade this current chart" problem just on a higher brick size *SIGH*

Hello again Rea. I looked over the AUDCHF and the chart is indeed confusing. Let's see if we can unravel it a bit. "Would you say I should treat the 30 pips fractal lines as trend lines and only trade in their direction? Does it mean the last trade, as it's being reversed, would be a loss? Why the 30 pips, then? why not bigger bars or use ATR?" Questions: I use 30 and 10 to help me understand where I am in the big picture. These two brick frames have a good relationship as is evidenced by the ability to show the teeth line from one on to the other with Fibonacci numbers involved. I don't use ATR Renko Bricks and I am not familiar enough with them to say if they are good are bad. Now let's look at the AUDCHF chart with 10 and 30 pip bricks. Maybe that will answer some more of the questions: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I did a quick count on the 30 and identified the last LH and its corresponding point on the 10 pip brick chart. Marked as X - 30 and X - 10. Now take a quick look at the down waves. Nice trending waves, with barely a fractal in them. Impulse waves. As price rises back to challenge the last LH it is going against the trend and shows corrective behavior. Lots of opposing wicks and fractals, It see saws back and forth over the teeth line. Corrective wave. You can trade that if you only trade long (dominant trend) but it is a messy place to trade. There are some smaller impulse waves in there but you always do better trading in sync with the larger dominant trend. From X - 30 price has worked its way up to a new HH. So above that, I would now expect the trend to be a lot better for long trades only. I placed a Boss Fib on that wave. (Have a look at Bat's last charts. He is nailing that concept.) It is a lot easier to see these things in retrospect - any one can read the past accurately. However by identifying the dominant trend and trying to follow that trend, results are much better. It keeps you out of the whips in the corrective waves. Having said that, there are good strategies for trading in the corrective waves. They require trailing stops on the fractals. That will come up as we move along with more content. Don't give up. There is a lot here and it is difficult to grasp but you will get your "AHA" moments. The more frustration you feel now, the bigger the "AHA" is going to be. I too am a left-hand right-hand type. At times I feel I almost have to go into a trance and relax before I can see the structure clearly and I often lose it again as I try to get it onto the chart. It gets easier with practice.

Hi Wab, Thanks for taking the time to explain. I'm still reading everything wrong, took a few educational trades and they reversed on me, and I mean, reversed *SIGH* Everything looks so good up until I enter a trade, I should open a reverse signalling service, take the opposite trade then I do and win. What am I missing still? What's a Boss Fib? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
The first Fib on a reversal is the Fib that shows us how far the move will potentially go. When you change trend for example from HH HL to LL LH, start at the final HH extend the fib to the first LL. The retrace to the first LH is often at, or close to, a Fib level such as 0.618 The 1.618 extension is the likely target. There are examples of Fibonacci placement on the thread. (post 352 and earlier.)

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Thanks Wab, How can I avoid entering such nasty trades? How could I have known that the trade would reverse like that? Maybe I'm not asking the correct questions?

Yes, everyone have a good weekend. I had a good week with family visiting. Don't forget the reasons why we do this. When we good at it we can help many other people. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Some study material: Dominant down trend at a glance - from the 30 pip bricks red line shown here in purple. Figure four trades, short only when AO is below zero. Two E Lines which were also BW fractals. Nice chart with lots of opportunities. Did I trade it? No, not much of it. I did get in on that last run up today. I did spend time with my daughters. I seldom see the younger one since she went off to university. There are always trades looming. Family time is more rare and more valuable by far.

Hi Wab, Thank you. How do you get the HBF red line to show on the LBF chart? Your last paragraph.... it is a holiday season here, so I get to see my nieces and nephews quite a lot which only makes me miss them more so yes, family always come first. Thank you, again.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
HBF has to be 30 and LBF 10 for this to work: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi Wab, Thanks. How did you come up with those numbers? Sorry if I sound pushy, I'm curious. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
A bit of trial and error - plus they are all Fibonacci numbers. Other people have done similar things with the Alligator on different time frames. You may find other brick frames where that works if you experiment, but like the 10 pip 30 pip relationship. So, that is where I experimented to see if I could get that HBF teeth line equivalent on the LBF. I think it is time now, to steer the discussion to Fibonacci and how it fits in with our HH HL LL LH scenarios. I will see about some posts on that topic as I get a chance to do so.

Fibonacci - my thoughts: First of all I am basically an Elliott Wave trader. That gives me a somewhat different outlook on Fibonacci compared to the people who have programmed MT4. They work on expansions and I work with contractions, then expansions. If you start off an Elliott wave sequence at point 0 bottom and run up to wave 1 and back down to wave 2, you have an expansion (wave 1) and a contraction (wave 2). Essentially, this is a LL and HH and a LH. Attached Image If your point 0 is at the top of a move then you have an expansion (down to wave 1) followed by a contraction (back up to wave 2.) In this case a HH down to a LL and then back up to a LH. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see how this fits in with the HH HL LL LH sequence that we have been using. Now this structure is very handy when it comes to Fibonacci Ratios. The problems begin when we think of how Elliott Wave works and how the MT4 Fibonacci is set up. If we start at point 0 and draw a Fib to point 1 at the end of our first expansion we then expect a contraction back to point 2. Usually that contraction is in the area between the 61.8 % and 76.4%. (An average of 69.1% is actually used by some traders.) Now when you look at the MT4 Fib tool, If you draw the Fib so that 0 is on point 0 and 100 is on point 1 ... the contraction values are not correct. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If we expand a move from 0 to 100 a retrace between 61.8% and 76.4 % actually lands between the 38.2% and 23.6% levels shown on the default settings on MT4. So what is the big deal? Well as I said I am basically an Elliott Wave trader and I like my ducks to line up. I do not like to see a 0 Fib value at wave (1) because I expect it to contract back towards 0, as it heads into wave wave (2) and stop at or around the area between 61.8% and 76.4%. The labels are just wrong. So in my way of thinking they need to be fixed. I haven't really seen anyone else raise a fuss over this and perhaps it is just me, but understanding this is important for what will follow. So how do we fix the Fib tool? (next post.)

--- 帖子 #487 ---
So here is how I like my Fibonacci Tool to look: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The settings are: Attached Image I have also attached an indicator "Set Fibo Price Any.ex4" This is a nice little indicator that automatically displays all of the prices on the Fib in any chart where it is added. Now, I have the Fibonacci Retracement tool set up (as I use it anyway) with the HH HL LL LH sequences. I will begin to show you how I use it. Again, I am not knocking what other people do, it is just that a like a move of 100% from a start of 0. I also like a pullback from a 100% move showing on my Fibs so that a 61.8% pullback is in fact at the 61.8% level, rather than 38.2% Fussy me. Here is what is looks like, with our modified Fib drawn on an E line reversal and Set Fibo Price Any active on the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I added in an Elliott Wave label (3) at the next up fractal. In fact the Fib level of 200.0% was hit a bit later. Once you understand the relationship between Fibonacci and 0, 1, 2 and 3 (and how 0, 1, 2 and 3 are merely a LL LH HH HL reversal) you will know more about counting Elliott Waves and trading them than most people on Forex Factory ever will. The Fibonacci that we draw on the E line reversal (just like this example) is the Boss Fib. When you locate it, draw it and study what happens each time it forms. It is an incredibly powerful match of price structure and Fibonacci Ratios. Have fun back checking for it and examining how price and Fib interact at each reversal. Homework: A nice example currently under way (as of Oct 9th 2015) is the Ten Pip Renko USDJPY. Maybe one of you will look at that and post a chart here.

Hi Wab, Thanks again for not letting this thread die and sharing your knowledge with us. Attached is my UJ chart, with the modified Fib settings, it's actually more readable this way, thanks for this. * With my luck, that last candle will reverse and will prove me wrong still learning. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Wab (and all), How would you recommend trading such a chart? Waiting for the break of the E (if I got it right) doesn't always work for me as the price usually touches the line and then continue its way up (or down). Also, on a another message, you've recommended taking only longs when the 10 pips teeth is above the 30 pips teeth, since the 10 is sloping rather nicely, doesn't it mean that if price breaks the E line and continue down, following such a rule will "cost" us a lot of pips? I'm still struggling with my charts, as you can see. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
This is how I see it: Wab mentioned about Elliott Waves and about importance of 61.8%-78.6% area. I don't see clear 3 wave correction on UJ and price didn't touched the 61.8%-78.6% area. So I'd wait for ideal situation when corrective waves AB=CD. That would end exactly on 61.8%. (sorry I didn't edit my fibo tool yet) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Good job Reamasesa and Krystyn. A nice trade is to go long as the price breaks above the 100 level. When it pulls back to 50% the odds are pretty good it will expand to 161.85, but wait for that breakout above 100.00 As Krystn pointed out, we don't know if it has completed a contraction and it may yet form an ABC type of pattern and still test the sweet zone between 61.8 and 76.4. As you look at different pairs you will find some of them may prefer a 50% contraction. Also look for an E line reversal around the Fib retrace levels. You may not always see one there but always look for one. When E is broken, remember that it has to continue for a bit to reach 100.00 at the wave 1 top, then it will move back down towards 0 into the Fib correction area to form the wave 2. Don't jump in at E wait for 100.00 plus a little bit. Wait until 2 is confirmed and we only know it is confirmed when price breaks above 1 or 100.00. There are ways to enter at or near 2. They are more risky than waiting for that 100.00 wave 1 breakout when wave 3 is confirmed. We will get to those. Catching a third wave, either at the 1 breakout or at or near the 2 turn, is the trade of dreams. We need to look at strategy and management of a third wave trade and how to get some of that contraction between 2 and 1 into the game as well. Please go and really look as a lot of charts and locate the Boss Fib. The Boss Fib sets the whole thing up for us and determines how we approach it. Locate it on your NZDUSD chart after any E line. Find the 100.00 level and then trail a trade from there with stops below each fractal. We learn by doing. When I get back, I will go over that chart. I have to leave shortly for Canadian Thanksgiving Dinner with some relatives a two hour drive away. I have a pending order at the 100.00 level on the USDJPY and will enjoy a turkey dinner while the market does what it does. If you are celebrating Thanksgiving Today enjoy the time with family and friends.

Hi Wab, Happy thanks giving! I do hope you enjoy your dinner and family time. This is how I view the NU, I'm not sure I would have survived going through the rectangle area I really like the fact that we're seeing more and more EW stuff and other goodies. Thank you. Will we see more EW and learn more of it? Happy holiday, Wab and all who are celebrating.

Hello Wab &amp; All, First, i like to say thanks a lot for wab willingness to taught us your knowledge. I love your simple approach ( Less Indicator ) with deeper trading concept. Oke, i just want to be little help to other that need indi &amp; script for wab FOREX, especially with trading with Four, special handy when u want to quick set for scalping as i used it with 40 brick size. This indi i put from other thread and adjust it to Four concept. To use indicator, just change StartTime &amp; EndTime to suit current time retracement. To use script, u can set set file in opposite way and unreasonable price: #Buy@Four : LongPendingEntryPrice &gt;&gt; -0,1 #Sell@Four : ShortPendingEntryPrice &gt;&gt; -0,1 I hope u can understand my poor english as im not really good at it

Thank you Tiong. I will have a look at those.

Hello Wab and all, I would like to get some help reviewing my attached charts, please. AUDUSD - Took the trade on the red arrow, thought it was going to be a "4" as price broke the "E" (at least, I think it did). If it reaches the 38.1 mark, I think I'll close it. CADJPY - Please ignore the red arrows, they are from a different scalping method I tried (ADX, not sure about it, repaints like crazy), I have a Boss Fib in place with two pending orders, one with TP just above the 150 line as the retrace was around 50, the other will be a free trade once profit is hit. I hope. EURAUD - OK, I had the Boss Fib in place, "E" was broken, I expected it to retrace and then continue downwards, my initial pending trades are still on chart so you can see what I was planning. Price went up. Any insights on this one would be greatly appreciated. GBPCAD - Price went down, broke a few HHs and HLs, I took the trade at the red arrow, closed it on the 123.6 line as retrace was only 23.6, but I think I should have seen the former "E" and let the trade run some more but I'm losing so much I just grab every pip I can get, I know it's not good. I know. GBPNZD - I took a trade at the 100 line, please ignore previous arrows, and let it ride, I wasn't at home so I closed it when I got back after it dropped back to the 150 line, which was a good thing as the price went down to form a double bottom. WoW! I would like to get some insights on this one, as well. NZDUSD - Boss Fib in place, price broke previous HH and HL, I took the trade at the red arrow, closed it around 132.8 line as it felt it wouldn't go any further. This one I was sure was going to go down some more. Any insights, comments or anything, would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

Hi Ria. Enough questions there to keep me busy for a week. Let me start by responding to an earlier question about the NZDUSD. I have marked up the trades on the NZDUSD 10 pip chart and added some detail to the way the AO is used to count Elliott Waves. You will hopefully find the Boss Fib and the figure Four trades familiar by now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The Boss Fib sets the stage for the move into wave 3. In this case wave 3 extended up to the 300 level and gave lots of Figure Four Trades on the way. When the AO started to diverge the Figure Four trades become risky. The divergence is marked on the AO. The AO can be used confirm the Elliott Wave Structure. At the end of an expansion (see waves 1 and 3) it forms a divergence. In a contraction (see waves 2 and 4) there is no AO divergence. The AO also retreats to the zero line (minimum) or usually lower in a wave 4. Simply put, that is how the AO is used to confirm or count Elliott Waves. To really get the full explanation of this, Bill Williams' Trading Chaos book is excellent. I don't want to try and recreate that here. I urge anyone interested in counting Elliott Waves with the AO or MACD to go and read his material over and over. One peeve that I have, is something I see repeated again and again online by people who style themselves as experts. The highest peak of the AO is not the top of wave three. It isn't. The highest peak of the AO is the internal wave 3 of the larger WAVE THREE. Only when a divergence, like the one shown here is reached, can we say that was the top of WAVE THREE. This is a basic mistake that I see many "AO/Elliott experts " make over and over again. Be aware of that and you already know more than many of these people. So, the AO divergence identifies a Wave 3 end, followed by a drop to zero (at least) usually lower for a wave 4. The NZDUSD chart shows all this very nicely. Now if only it were that easy. If you change the time frame, or pip frame, the whole picture can go out of focus. For example, wave 4 will not go all the way to zero if you are not focused correctly. You can get caught up in a wave count inside a larger wave count. Or you can be trying to make sense of a wave structure inside a prolonged wave 4 of a higher time frame. (The EURUSD) has been like this for some time. Only by zooming out and in can you identify the larger wave structures and find the correct focus. It takes lots of experience and understanding and you will still get wrong at times. My attempt to overcome this and to make it simple is to use the 10pip and 30 pip charts, so that two wave structures are visible and identifiable with the HH HL LL LH approach. As long as you can establish the trend on the HBF and trade in the same direction with the LBF things work quite well. One thing I will suggest is to not over trade. When I find myself looking at too many charts and trading more than one or two at a time I lose. Some people claim they can trade all the charts and I take my hat off to them. I look at no more than six pairs and do an overview of each. I then focus on the best one, or two, maximum and trade those. In that many pairs there is always a trade setting up. Better to trade a little and make a little than trade a lot and lose a lot. If you are losing cut way down and develop a sharper focus. I will try to look at some of the other charts you have posted, but I need to add to the Fibonacci materials. You will have noted with the NZDUSD that the Boss Fib expanded to the 300 level. Not all Boss Fibs are equal and I will show you what to expect from them next.

Wab. Words cannot describe how thankful I am for what you are doing here. * I am over trading. I've learned to put pending orders and step away from the keyboard though I do come to check on them from time to time. OK, I watch them all the time but I don't interfere with the initial setup unless something happens that demands it. Demands it. Not feeling like it. * I've wiped my small account several times already, it would have been better to trade with more money since some of the trades that I closed or got stopped out eventually went into profit I think it would have helped me not feeling so bad over all those losses but it was and still is a good learning experience. * My charts now are zoomed out, not to the maximum but enough so I can see the big picture. I still don't know how to trade this picture but I am looking at it and not on a few bars at a time. * I'm planning my setups now and not jumping on each 123 formation that shows up on the chart. * I'm participating and reading and saying I don't understand, you are helping with it and for that I am forever thankful. You've opened a new angle to my trading, thank you. If I understand correctly then the AUDUSD is heading up (1-2-3-4 and then 5 I think and then a-d, right?)(I would love to read more on EW and will certainly search for Bill's book) and I should close the trade but for learning purposes, I will keep it open, just to see if I'm right. A quick update on my trades * AUDUSD - still in play but slowly and painfully heading upwards * CADJPY - Still to hit the pending orders * EURAUD - Removed the pending orders * GBPCAD - Closed by the time I wrote the previous message * GBPNZD - Closed by the time I wrote the previous message * NZDUSD - Closed by the time I wrote the previous message * USDJPY - The one we were practising on, I had a pending order, took some time but it got there, closed it on the 123.6 mark and scalped a bit till it reached the 150 mark. I usually set two pending orders (or market orders, if the setup is right), one with a TP and the other I try to monitor and set it to BE + a few pips once the first trade hits TP, if it's running well, I'll trail it, usually by 24 or 16 pips, I've discovered those numbers are working well for me, if not, I either close it or let it play out to BE, but most of the time I'm trailing it. So I either have two losers or some other winning combination. Wab, I didn't ask before but am I interrupting the thread? Should I post less or not at all? Thank you very very much.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Rea. I don' think you are interrupting at all. I hope that the next material on Fibs helps a lot with your questions. In fact your questions are timely as this Boss Fib material will help you I believe. The depth of a wave 2 contraction often tells us what a likely third wave target will be. I only presented some of the Fibonacci levels to consider. (Trying to keep it simple.) When Wave 1 pulls back to the 61.8% area for example then a likely target for wave 3 is going to be 161.8%. It can of course go higher as we have seen on the NZDUSD example. If it only pulls back to 78.6% then the likely target is not 1 61.8% but 127%. Here are a full set of custom Fib levels. I mainly watch the ones I mentioned earlier but the others are also to be considered. (When you add the - $% after the numbers in your Fib tool settings, you will get the price level displayed along with the percentage level. The Set Fib Any indicator also accomplishes this.) Level 0 0.146 0.236 0.382 0.5 0.618 0.786 0.86 0.942 1 -0.18 -0.27 -0.382 -0.618 -1 -1.618 -3.236 Description 0.0 - %$ (14.6 - %$) 23.6 - %$ 38.2 - %$ 50.0 - %$ 61.8 - %$ 78.6 - %$ (86.0 - %$) (94.2 - %$) 100.0 - %$ 118.0 - %$ 127.0 - %$ 138.2 - %$ 161.8 - %$ 200.0 - %$ 261.8 - %$ 423.6 - %$ And here are the wave 2 – to wave 3 “likely” target projections: 23.6% &gt;&gt; 161.8% 38.2% &gt;&gt; 161.8% 50% | 61.8% &gt;&gt; 161.8% 78.6% &gt;&gt; 0% | 127.% 86.0 &gt;&gt; 0% 100.0+ &gt;&gt; Reversal When we get to how to enter trades in a contraction we will use the levels that I suggested earlier. For now the important thing to really focus on, is that we only know for certain that a third wave is going to happen when price breaks past the 100% (wave 1) level. We don't know for sure that wave 2 is confirmed either until that happens, but there are the wave 2 strategies that we haven't really discussed yet.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Here is the AUDUSD, looking like a wave 5 has now been confirmed by the break above the recent E line. I should have waited for the second pass of the E line, that way I do not not have to weather the contraction. Still, let's see what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hi Wab, Thanks for the Fibo levels, I've added them to the default Fibo tool (pity it can't be saved as a setting file and I'll have to do it for all the the MT4 instances I'm using). Still not sure how to count the waves but I think we're getting there so I'll wait Thanks again, Wab.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi Wab, Why didn't my entry, marked with a red arrow, go well? I was sure price will go down more. TIA.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Looking at the horizontal red arrow: You were going against the trend of the higher brick frame and also there is a bullish divergence on the AO. However, the results depend on where you ran your stops. If you had followed stops down on the higher degree Lower Highs, it would be a good trade but the initial stop is a very big one. Think of waves within waves, when you enter on a small one a larger reversal stops you out. Also your E line needs to be considered. The second pass through the E line is a safer entry and it would have allowed you some profits if you trailed a two bar and a pip stop, inside of that bigger wave. Hope that helps a bit. (Hindsight is always easy.) You only get confident by having a clear system that you understand and feel that you can depend on.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Here is a zoomed in view of that GBPJPY chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Wave ONE down has five internal waves (1,2,3,4,5)that the fractals catch nicely. Wave ONE ends with hard-to-see divergence on the AO. Wave TWO up, contracts to the 76.4 Fib level. ( I didn't draw the Fib on the chart because it was getting cluttered.) The third wave down goes a long way and gives two excellent places for Figure Four Trades. When you get a break of the E line wait until you get a wave TWO and then think of an entry. Initial stop above the ZERO HH then move the stop down by each LH. As always, hindsight is perfect but the more you recognize the structure in historical context the more it will become visible as it develops in real time. Always add the HH HL LL LH and E lines as it progresses. Hope that helps. On another note: I have been thinking of introducing an E line indicator but I feel that it is much better for an analyst to do that work themselves. Indicators make us lazy and also prevent us from thinking things through on our own and really gaining understanding of them. For example, we don't need an indicator that labels a line and says "here is a blue line." There are many things that we can do without a lot of effort and analysis becomes one of those with practice. We have to be careful to not have too much on a chart that we do not put there ourselves. Renko, Renko Shade for the HBF, AO, AC, and the Alligator and HBF red/purple line should be loads to work with. However, in my next post I want to talk about the spread and I will add some convenient tools that display it for us. (Yes another indicator because we can't just glance at a chart and know the impact of the spread that easily.) Spread has a huge impact on our strategy. Add the Bid Ask Line to your charts and Candle Time &amp; Spread. They ere not intrusive at all and are important.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Some thoughts on the spread: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looking at the chart we can see the dotted, red, bid ask lines, to the right of the last brick. These dotted lines and the value from the candle time and spread indicator, display and show the current spread and the current spread value. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the brick chart, I plotted a pair of moving averages (in black) that show the spread width above the high and below the low of each brick. These moving averages show the spread when it was at 25, in bands that are above and below the bricks The spread changes and these spread bands are static, however they show approximately where the spread has been in relation to the bricks. Now consider an order which is one pip above or below a brick and also consider how the spread should be allowed for. If we put and order at a brick level it could be filled before the brick is even completed and then the price moves away leaving us with an order that was filled in violation of any strategy we are using. This of course also applies to stops and Fib Levels and any price level that we are considering as an entry a stop or even a target.

I wish Santa brought me new lessons. Just started reading Trading the Chaos to magnify capabilities of my sock.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
It sounds like Santa is being good to you Krystyn. In the New Year, I think I will add some ideas on trading Renko with an Ea. It seems that every discussion on trading ends up doing that anyway. Have a Merry Christmas and we will aim for a Prosperous New Year.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
In this case limited use of simple ea could be sound. I mean trader decides about timespan, conditions and setup then unleash the ea to execute mechanical part of the job. Till now figure four is most reliable approach to renko - it gives map where to put a price trap. Have a Merry Christmas too.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Still works! Thanks WAB!

--- 帖子 #509 ---
I would be very grateful if one can provide a list of indicators and ea used in this kind of trading system. Yes, I know that it is available in the attachment section, but there are too many indicators and I don't know which of them are still working. Yes, I am a renko lover

--- 帖子 #510 ---
The only indicators used are the AO, Fractals and Fibonacci. The rest requires studying HH HL LL LH (no reliable indicator available for that) and learning how to identify an E line (current reversal level) and draw the BW Fork. Reading over the thread may be tedious but there it is.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hello Wab and all I have just finished reading this thread and my plan now is to adopt this strategy. I do use a couple of other methods but this is the icing on the cake. I truly believe that the knowledge I have gained from reading this thread is priceless and the information provided here for free by Wab is the key to successfully trading the markets. All I can say is thank you.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
RENKO is fantastic

--- 帖子 #513 ---
It certainly is, just need to be careful when it's ranging, though And this thread is simply one of the best there are.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi thank you for the indicator! does anyone have it for a 5 digit broker?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
These are Expert Advisors to build different Renko Charts, these are not Indicators, you must put them in the Expert Folders from your Mt4 and not all are still working. They are made for 5 digit Broker

--- 帖子 #516 ---
is there EA like this one where you can set 2.5 pip mean renko you might know?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...06#post7259306 with the first one you can make all kind of renko charts.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Thaank you

--- 帖子 #519 ---
do you guys have a "renko close marker" for MT4?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I don´t know exactly what you mean, but maybe one of this helps.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Range predictor was the one, Thank you @eurix

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi How do i get my renko chart to look like this, i.e painting a new brick side by side with the last brick if the new brick is moving in the opposite direction, and not a whole brick higher or lower than the last brick Please ignore the 'multiple brick reversal' part in the attached chart, i got this image from another thread

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Try the no gap renko EA, use the search bar as I'm not sure on which thread I last saw it. Either that or what you're showing is a range bars chart.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
So did you reply on the other trade? Maybe its this

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi Wab, I read thoroughly from the 1st page to page 14 and can begin to wrap my mind around this and then come the above quoted sentences from you. Are you sure it's not a typo? Shouldn't the sentences be: A new LH cannot be identified until price moves past the previous LOW A new HL cannot be identified until price moves past the previous HIGH ? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Big USDCAD move due to news and the simple HH-LL + Median Renko system helps me catch it as it happens.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
nice mate, what box size are you using?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi Andddres1, I'm using 10 pips block with OVO's Mean Renko indicator. Still stay in the above trade until now. Has added one more entry and another pending one below the current fractal. Has made 181 pips until I type this and has already locked the oldest entry. Yaay!

--- 帖子 #529 ---
thnx man, cheers

--- 帖子 #530 ---
IMPORTANT QUESTION Do somebody know is there exist indicator with give alert, when heiken ashi change colour ? But its have to close renko candle 5 or 10 pips. There shoudnt be fake signals when candle appear. I heard about indicator with give you a lot of alarms during candle appear, but I need only 1 alarm when candle close with changed heiken ashi colour. Please help

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I don´t know how often the Alarm appear, but you can try these, then you will see.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi Guys. I have been away from the computer as much as possible in our brief Canadian summer. I will get back to "work" soon and get caught up on questions etc. I have a new indicator (new to me anyway) that I will add to our mix here and I hope that we can make it as useful as I think it could be. I hope that all goes well with everyone.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Wab. Welcome back.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi Wab! Welcome back, I, too, am hoping everything had been well with you. I'm still using your method, albeit, on a somewhat crooked way It will be great continuing on this journey, thanks for coming back to us.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Every discussion on trading methods reaches a point at which it pauses for a while then some new breath is breathed into it. Breath deep. I have not posted for a while for two reasons: Summer is short where I live and I want to take advantage of the season. Secondly and more importantly, I needed to do some research and try and answer some of the questions that I have been asked and also questions that I have asked myself. How do I make all this easier to understand? One question I must mention was from Kisruh, who noticed this error. I read thoroughly from the 1st page to page 14 and can begin to wrap my mind around this and then come the above quoted sentences from you. Are you sure it's not a typo? Shouldn't the sentences be: A new LH cannot be identified until price moves past the previous LOW A new HL cannot be identified until price moves past the previous HIGH Correct Kisruh. Thanks for catching that. I struggle a bit with the whole jargon of HH HL LL LH. When even I am even getting mixed up with the whole HHHL LLLH sequence I think it is time to simplify it a bit. Maybe change the jargon to a simpler form for ease of communication. Initially, I wanted to present a method of analyzing a chart that did not involve Elliot Wave - which is great but requires a lot of study. Then there is the endless debate as to who has the correct count and so forth. I decided that simple zigzag indicator, similar to the Zig Zag Fractals indicator we have already used, would be a big help. What I wanted was a Zig Zag that was green for up moves and red for down moves. I looked high and low and couldnt find one. (You would think that someone would have come up with an idea like that.) What I ended up finding is much more powerful. I will add this indicator to the thread shortly, but to make it effective I think I have to delve into Elliott Wave Theory just a little bit. Bear with me please and you will appreciate why. Lets have a look at a classic Elliott Wave diagram: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You will note that this diagram shows a primary wave 1 up and a primary wave 2 down. Inside of the two primary waves are 8 intermediate waves and inside those are 34 minor waves. The Elliot Wave shows the fractal nature of the markets. Every time we got to a lower time frame there are these similar waves making up the bigger waves. It is easy enough to see and quite tough to work with. You can apply the HH HL LL LH analysis to each degree of waves and should attempt to do so. [Have a special look at the 4 and A minor waves which are often a source of confusion in our HH HL LL LH counts. If you can be aware of the higher degree waves then that is somewhat helpful to avoid this 4 A confusion. I believe that 4 A is a tricky point in HH HL LL LH analysis and we can try to counter it later on with our indicators acting as a filter.] Anyhow, please study the Elliott Wave Diagram and try to get the idea of degrees of waves operating in your thinking. In every HHHL sequence there are smaller hhhl lllh sequences . In every LLLH sequence there are smaller hhhl lllh sequences. (I hope Kisruh checks me on that to make sure I got it right. It is a bit of a mental tongue twister.) Once you understand the degrees of (HH HL LL LH) Elliott Waves, waves within waves, you are mentally armed to look at what comes next. Here is a second Elliott Wave diagram that you can study to the same end. Attached Image (click to enlarge) One more note: Elliott Wave has a very particular way of counting waves. We are not going to use that in great detail, but may refer to it for discussion purposes. Keep your EW diagrams handy, maybe even print them out for this purpose. We will be able to have a unique (non Elliott) label on every turn in a Renko Chart from now on and that will provide great reference points for discussion. Too often it is so difficult and time consuming to know what someone is asking or referring to when we talk about charts. You are going to love how we will get around that problem in future charts.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Now I am want to talk more about trends and counter trends: A Bullish Trend is a sequence of HH Hl A Bearish Trend is a sequence of LL LH A Bearish Counter Trend is a sequence of ll lh. A Bullish Counter Trend is a sequence of hh hl. [I am not sure how extensively I will use this to label charts (as we may soon be past all that) but I do want you to be open to the idea that there are smaller waves within the larger waves.] How about my quest to just have green lines for and up move and red ones for a down move? Here is more homework: Study this chart very carefully, it is very, very powerful. Use what you know about HH HL LL LH and also look for hh hl ll lh. It may hurt your brain a bit and that is good because we tend to hurt a bit as we learn something new. No brain without pain. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Now, we come to the part that makes this really useful - a distinct label on every change in direction. Green label for up moves, red label for down moves. Trends with thick lines and counter trends with thin lines. Again study the chart. A thin line changes into a thick line when a previous high or low is exceeded While you are at it, look for places where there is a HH HL LL LH reversal (or a hh hl ll lh reversal.) See if you can locate the E lines (or the smaller e lines.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) It gets even better ... excited yet?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Okay. We are getting there. Thanks for your patience. If you identified some E lines her is where you check to see if you were correct. The higher degree E lines are identified here. If you have read the whole thread you will understand this. If you haven't, then go and do it now. The best is yet to come but it won't be any use to you if you have not started at the beginning. Lower degree e lines are not identified but thin lines that change into thick lines (in real time) will show where the lower degree e lines are to be found. Here is the same chart with Green E lines and Red E lines displayed. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Go long on a green E line break, go short on a Red E line break. It is really important to compare this chart to the Elliott Wave Charts a few posts back. Can you see that we have a big wave 1 and a big wave 2? Wave 2 may still be in progress, we wont know wave 2 is completed until price passes above wave 1 towards a new HH and confirms the wave 2 LH. (Unless wave 2 passes the origin of wave 1 at the -11 label and adjusts the larger degree count. See how Elliott Wave can drive you a tad insane?) Regardless, we now have a clearly identified structure complete with labels and higher degree E lines that we can easily refer to and discuss. That alone is going to make things a lot easier.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Putting it all together: HH HL LL LH, hh hl ll lh, E lines, labels, primary waves and intermediate waves, analysis is at a glance (if you have studied this thread.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have given you a lot to digest. If you didn't do the homework, go back and do it. You will bog down in the coming charts if you don't do it.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
What I do is when price breaks the LH and trend direction is to uupside i take the pullback long same for shorts

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Sounds like you are entering on the reversal of a counter trend - if I understand. A very good strategy. Perhaps you can post a chart example for us.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
"Putting it all together: HH HL LL LH, hh hl ll lh, E lines, labels, primary waves and intermediate waves, analysis is at a glance (if you have studied this thread.)" Ok Wab. You officially have given me a headache. I can do the HH HL LH LL labels. Red to green, thin to thick......man not yet easier! Keep up the teaching. I'm trying to get your new stuff. (I really like the old!!) Your post number 538 the 5th green line up line from the left????? I reckon it should be a RED down line . Dyslexia maybe?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Ultimately I hope to make it easier, give you an automatic transmission versus a standard. One benefit is that we will all have the same labels on our charts and the same E lines. .... If we use the same broker. My thinking is that that same chart template should, more or less, have us taking the same trades if we use the same rules. I hope it is easier, just tell me if it isn't.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Wab Have you tried using the Ovo Omniaautorange indicator? I'm using it to give me the Higher Brick value that is most in sync with the current market trend. I think it only works with their Renko creating software so not good for all traders.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I use OVO and can highly recommend it.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I use the Ovo Renko with wicks. I have not tried his other stuff. I really like the Ovo Renko with wicks and think it worth the price. One of the things we run into is different people using different Renko generators on different broker's data feeds. This often causes the charts that they post have variations. I use Ovo Renko with wicks and I use Pepperstone demo data for my research. (I also use their platform for some of my trading.) If we all use Ovo and Pepperstone in this discussion, then the data differences on our charts will not happen. The software that I have been hinting at for our templates would also enable us to know exactly which label on a chart is up for discussion. We will all have the same labels. Okay, my rant is over: Time to download the Road Map V.04 indicator and get familiar with it with it. I think it is very powerful - more of an identifier than an indicator. Instead of struggling with Elliott Wave labels and learning all that complex counting stuff, we can all be on the same map. https://www.mql5.com/en/code/13800 (remember is it the V.04 version you should download. We all want to be on the same map.) I am not going to post for a bit. Take the time to use the Road Map and get very familiar with it. The HH HL LL LH fractals are not going to go away. TRENDS and COUNTER TRENDS are more identifiable, internal smaller trends and counter trends are also easy to spot, fractal breakouts and ... E lines! Yup, E lines and alerts. (Incoming Mail alert.) Have fun. See if things are bit easier. Let me know. By the way, I just had an E line alert on the USDJPY and went short on it. I knew hours and hours ahead to place a pending order there. Road Map alerted while I was writing this. Love those Renko Charts. Up 15 pips on that E line entry already.

Wab I can see why you like this road map. Very cool. Suddenly impulse and corrective wave start to mean something to me. This is like putting in glasses for the first time when your vision has been dodgy for years!

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Try using range bars a take the pullbacks

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Quick scalp during my lunch break Impulse wave at BW Fork small correction then next impluse. I trailed stop 2 fib levels behind. Could of made more... 20/20 hindsight always great. Happy with a profit. Note I draw my Boss Fib from open of impulse wave bar to close of impulse wave bar. I've found my targets good to the pip! Road map is good.

Hi Wab I have been following your thread for some time without putting on any trades - just learning the ropes so to speak. Thank you for what you are doing for all of us on this thread very much appreciated. I will be trying the system out on a Demo from the same broker that you are using. Will post some charts when I get going. Attached is a snap shot from the Road Map site. I take it it is the second [with a tick] that you are meaning for us to download - not the one with the red cross. The version appears to be 04 rather than 1.04. Not trying to be critical but just trying to get the right download. Looking forward to learning more from you especially as well as other contributors. Attached Image

Yes that is the correct one. V04 Thanks for noticing that and good luck with it. (I edited that post.)

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thanks for sharing your knowledge Wab I am a noob when it comes to PA, but this thread is certainly the place to learn.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Welcome to the thread BBalazs. I hope it is very useful to you. I think it is a bit of a study but it does help you look at charts with a discerning eye.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hello Bataview How and where can i get ur template?? please direct me to the site i can buy your Renko Brick charts?? Thank you Jannie

--- 帖子 #555 ---
The Renko generator is at https://ovo.cz/ A lot of us use the Ovo product. (Not a commercial plug, just that it is available and well supported.) There are other Renko generators that are free if you do some research. There are free eas that help produce an offline Renko chart. Batavier may want to share his template - which is a very nice one. However it will only work with the Renko Generator on a M1 chart being used to produce the offline chart that he shows his template on here. If you have not produced a Renko chart before, then you have some homework ahead of you on how to do it. There is material back earlier in the thread that will help you. I do recommend reading from the start.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Thank you WAB Yes i have used offline Renko charts before, but the OvO looks very interesting. Still a newbie, but always looking at new stuff.. Kind regards jannie

--- 帖子 #557 ---
One of the reasons I like Ovo is that all the confusion around build 600 and subsequent upgrades was not as big an issue with them as it as with the "free" Renko generators. Many of those freebies just quit working until some generous coder manged to figure out a fix. Some of them are great but when you become reliant on a free sourced Renko generator be aware that some produce different bricks and missing bricks and even give you a totally different chart when you re-start MT4. Trading is hard enough without those aggravations.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I would really like input on his from people who are better at this sort of thing than I am. One of the things I like about Renko is how the fixed brick size allows you to plan your strategy. Let’s discuss the initial stop as the first part of an overall strategy. My thinking is that an initial stop should be two bricks back, plus spread and also plus a pip. For example: If the spread is 2.0 and we are using 10 pip bricks, then our initial stop should be 23 pips beyond the base of the brick we are entering on. We will not get a reversal in the trend until the price moves back more than two bricks (20 pips.) Adding an extra pip ensures that a reversal has in fact happened. (Price is actually past the two bricks back and the bricks are now going the other way.) The spread also has to be taken account of as well and added onto the stop level. At first this seems to be a big stop but to my way of thinking that is required in the early stages of a reversal. Please comment. Share your insight on this and we can all agree (or disagree) on what is a critical component of a Renko trading system. I am looking forward to resolving this. If you agree with it, great. If you have insights that I have not covered then please let us know.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
The OVO product will save MT4's tick data, thus eliminating the "repaint" issue ( once you close your MT4 and open it again, the bricks will look somewhat different ) which is common with free Renko experts.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Wab not trying to be a teacher here but a 10 brick renko can actually move up to 29.9 pips before it prints. Therefore I tend to use that plus spread for my stop but this is your show so I'll follow what's going on with interest.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Correct

--- 帖子 #562 ---
No problem handy. Some things I think I have figured out and then a better idea comes along. It may be (somewhat) my show but I am very open to good ideas and encourage discussion. Everyone benefits that way. I realize it can move that far before it prints, but what is the best point at which to put that initial stop? I am trying to get a firm resolution to that. (Once a move starts, a trailing stop strategy may be the next thing to agree on and there are also other entries to consider, like fractal breakouts etc.) I hope that we can all put our heads together here and agree on some good tactics for all of us to go forward with. 29.9 pips (plus spread and a pip?) is a big stop indeed but a safe stop is desirable. Is it beneficial to have a larger safer stop on Renko or cut losses early? Jump in with other thoughts anyone.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I personally prefer to pull the plug on a trade that is not going in my favor ASAP. It is safer to operate with the assumption (fact) that nobody knows where the price goes next. If I aim to enter long on a pullback and the price goes below my entry point - making a LL, there is really no reason to hold onto the trade.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
For those who wanted it here's my template. Please note you'll need the roadmap indi and its for the offline ovo renko charts. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
As a loyal user of Renko for more than 6 yrs and I would like to say this and only for just once this time is that the key of renko method lies in the value size of the bricks according to each different currency pairs and once you got it figured out then all the hh, hl, lh, ll etc will be as clear as days and nights. Do not get distracted by any other approaches and someday you will definitely hit the nails on its heads. My first and last post on this thread. Happy trading all..... GS.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
This roadmap stuff is interesting - not sure I've got my head around it all yet but getting there.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Haven't been able to read much so I still need to catch up. My charts don't look like yours too much highs and lows. Anyways, I'll be reading the current addition and see if my charts can be improved. My contribution. Added email alerts and alerts when the "E" line is formed - Still need to test it And the ability to remove the lines and leave only the "E" lines. for those of us with too cluttered charts or those who just want the "E" lines. The ability to remove the fractals numbers was already there. Not a coder so if it's not working... well, I'll try to help but not a lot I can do.

Thank you BATAVier for sharing ur template - will now sit and see how to read it and put it on a demo account

--- 帖子 #569 ---
GENGHISTAR - where can i read more about ur approach to understand the magic behind the bricks?? How do i learn the sizes? Thank you

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Good to hear from so many of you tonight and see that the interest here is so strong. Regards different time frames, range bars, median Renko bars, variations in brick size etc. etc. As far as I am concerned we are all here to learn from each other, so feel free to post templates, charts ideas, strategies etc. My theme is that HH HL LL LH is the prevailing force in any chart and I will keep grinding away at that. Sooner or later someone will ask for an ea and a zillions indicators will be added, but I think the price action component is capable of surviving that. Road Map is one tool that I have added, there are a coupe of others that I like, but one at a time. Let's really work over Road map on the Renko charts and see what it reveals. (As an aside Road Map is a great tool on time based charts as well. Try it and see. Watch it in action on a M1 chart, especially when new labels arrive. It's after midnight here so I will sign off soon, but as I said, share your ideas and as long as we are all trying to help each other it should be a good forum for doing that. I will ask people to post charts when they talk about trades so that we can easily see what they mean. Post brick size, pair name and spread and that will be very useful because we can pull up the same chart on our own screens and draw in anything that we notice in our replies. I should have some time tomorrow to add some of my thoughts on the Road Map. I believe it will make the HH H LL LH thing a lot easier to work with. When we get past a thorough Road map debate, I have some other stuff that I know will prove interesting to everyone who has studied this material. Fun and fortune ahead. Lots of charts please. Charts help everyone learn. Again - thanks for all the kind words and welcome to the new visitors.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Here is a potentially useful tool. Just add the indicator to your chart, adjust the color as you like and make sure the chart is set on background (in the properties.) Saves tired eyes from searching for most of the reversal bricks. (I added it to Batavier's nice template.)

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Unable to trade this morning Life gets in the way at times. But here's what I saw in the charts. The reason my old semafor indi is on the charts is that a starburst warns me of impending reversals.(yes it repaints I know!!!! its an alert to look for a BW fork not a signal to trade.) Brick size chosen as it suits the Asian session for USD/JPY.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Reamasesa - can you tell me which lines in the code to alter to make the red and green E-lines thicker please?

Hi, Change lines 208 and 234 Inserted Code Out_TL(n,iTime(_Symbol,TF,b0S),HS,t_prob,HS,"prob_U",clr_Prob_UP,TF,1,[i][b]2[/b][/i]); Inserted Code Out_TL(m,iTime(_Symbol,TF,b0S),LS,t_prob,LS,"prob_D",clr_Prob_DW,TF,1,[i][b]2[/b][/i]); Change the "2" to something else.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi, Still not fully understanding the Road Map indicator. What's a corrective wave and all the other things it shows? And I think it only follows the Chuvashov Fork when it prints out the "E"s. Here are two screenshots. The XAUUSD kicked in and was terminated by a trailing stop in profit.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Here is how I propose we start to use Road Map in conjunction with the Alligator and AO. (The HH HL LL LH sequence is in there too and we can also integrate it in the second chart.) We know that the market moves in trends counter trends until a reversal in the structure occurs. When AO is above zero we know the trend is bullish where it is green and counter trends where it is red. A divergence in the AO indicates a trend change. When AO is below zero the trend is bearish where it is green and counter trends where it is red. A divergence in the AO indicates a trend change. The AO is designed to work with the Alligator. (Note that Batavier has altered the Alligator settings to match his style of trading on his template, if you are using his template be aware of that.) In this first chart below, I have illustrated how Road Map, AO and the (classical) Alligator work together for us. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the left hand side we see Road Map has labeled the fractals from -8 to -9 with a heavy purple line. Section -8 to -9 down trend that matches the red (below zero) slope of the AO. It also is moving away from the hungry Alligator. At -9 we get a bullish Reversal Candle with its long wick pointing down. Any trade taken here is heading back into the Alligator. It is a counter trend trade. (You can take these counter trend trades if the distance back to the Alligator gives you room to do so. Be careful though, better to trade with the trend.) At -12 we have crossed the Alligator and it has briefly gone to sleep forming a saddle point . (A saddle point is where the Alligator has become very tight. In fact the Alligator is trapped between fractals -11 and -12. We have bricks with wicks at both fractals so best thing to do here is straddle the -11 and -12 saddle point with pending orders. The market breaks below -11 and fills a pending stop and we are in phase with both a Red AO and a hungry Alligator. At -13 we get a Bullish Reversal Brick with its wick. Time to place a stop and the trade is closed. ( A good trailing stop works well for this.) AO now has a Bullish Divergence (sorry I didn't draw that one on the chart.) Fractals -14 and -15 tangle with the Alligator but this is not a saddle point as the Alligator is not totally trapped between the two fractals. If we were long at -13 then moving our stop to just belwo -15 is a good strategy or we might have closed at the bearish reversal brick at -14. Trailing stops on fractals like -15 and later at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and ultimately stopped out at 12 or stopping and re-entering at -14, 1,3,5,7 and 9 are a matter for future discussion. At the Green E line a very interesting thing happens. Our Road Map changes a light purple line into a heavy Blue Line. (If you are watching, you will see line color and thickness change each time a structural change in the HH HL LL LH sequence occurs. Drop it on a M1 chart and observe if you haven't noticed that before.) The line from -15 to 1 will change as price breaks above the E line which has been sitting there n our radar as a potential change in our LL LH HH HL sequence of waves in the chart. AO also crosses Zero at this point. AO turned green with a Bullish Reversal Brick back at -13 we crossed the Alligator at -14 , found support at -15 and now we have a change in the Road Map to a heavy Blue. [Actually, without Road Map, I would have had my potential E line at - 10. The difference between an indicator mathematically trying to identify a chaos feature and a human mind at work being evident here. I mention this because RM is very good but at time gets tangled in the different degrees of Elliott Wave. We will see more of this later in this chart.] Between 1 and 9 we get a series of heavy blue trends with small light blue counter trends. Look at the Bullish Reversal Bricks with wicks at 2, 4 ,6 and 8. Would you trade toward the Alligator there? AO is above zero, not how it is green in the smaller bullish trends and red in the little counter trends against the over all larger Bullish Trend. Watch AO is now giving bearish divergence signs at 9 and we get a larger counter trend right into the Alligator. The we are moving back into that E line at 8. At -1 the E line breaks but do we go short? Have look at the first -13 on the left and the -1 at this E line. This red E line occurs in a chaotic tangle of Alligator and a Green E line at 17 is really close. The real clue is the tangled Alligator. A tangled Alligator mean a corrective wave is taking place. Stay out of it, be cautious. In Elliott Wave this is wave four or maybe a B wave. No matter. It is a mess. We almost immediately get a Bullish Reversal Brick with its wick at -1 then a saddle point forms between -2 and -3. Ah that's starting to make sense now. "Aha!" you say... straddle that saddle with pending orders. AO swings back green and by the price breaks out of the straddled, saddle point above -2. The Green E line at 17 Road Map is broken and once again RM has started to draw us a heavy blue line. Bullish Trend! A retest of the Alligator at 2 and then a lovely third wave (in Elliott Wave terms.) We just call it a Bullish Trend, never mind the Elliott Wave stuff, A rose by any other name. AO is green again. Life is good and an AO divergence (not shown on the chart) sees the move topping out at 13. Time to get cautious again as price heads back into the Alligator. Attachment An awful lot to digest. RM allows us to label points for discussion. RM identifies trends. RM color change at E lines. Saddle points should now be part of our discussion. (Alligator trapped between two, close, opposing fractals.) Straddle the Saddle strategy is introduced. Bullish and Bearish Brick Reversal bars ... with their wicks. AO trends and little trends and counter trends within the larger trends counter trends. Green and red waves within the AO. AO crossing zero coincident with E line breaks. Alligator showing trends and counter trends back towards the Alligator. Lots to digest. Please post your charts as above for discussion purposes. Default Alligator, Pair name Brick size and RM on the chart. When your head stops hurting, let's see how HH HL LL LH apply on the same chart in the next post.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Same chart. I want to show you that RM (Road Map) is pretty god but it doesn't identify a higher degree wave count. (Refer back to the Elliott Wave diagrams posted earlier.) You need to know that higher degree count at all times and you have to do this on your own. RM doesn't do that for you I have identified the higher degree count with capital HH HL LL LH labels and the lower degree count with hh hl ll lh labels. With last HH label we know that the market is now heading into a correction. AO and the Alligator tell us this. RM is busy identifying purple heavy down trends and keeping those away from the feeding Alligator. -2 and -3 and -5 and -6 make some saddle points. A black dashed line sows where the higher degree E line would form. If you check you can see that hh hl ll lh labels have been added to try and show that within the trends an counter trends identified by RM our waves can be counted and RM does a very good job at this level. My thought here is always keep the bigger picture higher degree count in mind . Mark it on your charts and it will let you know when you are in sync with a bigger wave. Do this and watch the classical Alligator and the AO and you will be able to avoid trying to trade inside the higher degree corrective waves. Attached Image (click to enlarge) These last two posts are very critical. I urge you to study them thoroughly and make the thoughts your own before you move forward. Keep your charts simple and master them. No need to have anything more than Alligator RM AO and identify the higher degree wave using HH HL LL LH. Have fun. Share charts. Help each other.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Thanks for that Rea. I get the feeling you are going to overhaul Rm for us. One thing I would like is to have less thick heavy lines on the chart. Now that you have identified where the line thickness is set I may even be able to do that on my own. I used to program in BASIC and PASCAL but starting stuff only in C++. Reading MQL code is something that I am reasonably adept at but writing is not in my repertoire. Many of you are a real assets to this thread. When I help you - I get as much or more back. GENGHISTAR and his comment about brick size has me thinking. I used ten pip bricks for a lot of my research. Then Wiseguy sent me a thought about using really small brick sizes like Batavier does. That got some more thinking started for me. I do believe that we can push this along nicely. I have some more material that I will share after the dust settles from the Road Map addition to the charts. You will learn why an E line is an E Line and at that point I think Rea will get those counts really sorted out. After that I think we can really hammer out an excellent trading system here and I look forward to seeing my theories fleshed out by the capable group we have here. I would urge everyone to put RM on a regular M1 chart along with the AO and the Alligator. You can use the M1 chart that feeds your Renko. You can not learn enough about that combination and it applies to any chart, time based, or Renko.

Thank you for all ur useful information!!!!!!

Hi Wab, Thanks for taking the time to write out some very cogent thoughts on how to interpret what the market is 'saying' at any point in time. As you know from experience, successful trading involves both the analytical as well as the subjective. That is why quality screen time can be oh so important. It's not just looking at a potential situation, but also going within and asking ourselves what would the market have to do to confirm our interpretations, while sensing the timing of how long it's taking for price to develop or not. It's kind of like drawing a line in the sand and saying to ourself is the behavior of the market agreeing with our interpretation. That is why it is very important to have a sense of where the market is in the wave count which would corroborate whether to trade or stay out of the market till the smoke clears. Just some additional thoughts for rumination. Have a pleasant weekend. WGT

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Indeed, the line in the sand, at which we know what to expect next. or where to re-think our analysis. Have a good weekend too. Raining here so I will likely be back-testing some ideas on brick sizes.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
On smaller brick sizes like 5 (which I know is outside the parameters of what has been discussed before) I can see that for example the break of the green E-line gives a long opportunity and the stop could be the previous red line. You may get whipsawed a few times but when you get one of those long runs it sure does make up for it, specially if you trade DAX like I do. This thread getting better and better every day - can't wait for the next instalment, particularly as it's weekend and I get the time to test and play around with stuff.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I have been experimenting with setting the brick size to the spread. Some interesting things to think about there. Saddle points between the bid and ask being one of them. Hmm.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Wab, One of my Renko EAs that I have recently purchased as stated in their Manual that the majority of people have not woken up to the fact the spread defines the brick size and setting a brick size to 10 is usually wrong due to the Brokers spread is usually larger especially after the UK session. Now I believe this company and have great success with their version of the renko brick and would recommend the user should always adjust the brick size to the spread per currency pair. If the size is smaller and/or larger you loose the entry and exit points and eventually money.. Cliff

--- 帖子 #585 ---
The spread affects your trade result for sure, but why should the Renko brick size relate to the spread? If you record your trades statistics, you may exactly determine which setup is still suitable for the particular spread size - i.e. what is the minimum SL/TP distance to accept the spread cost. It might have relation to the brick size - if the strategy uses it - but not so simple as you expressed.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I'm still trying to learn all the options within OVO but I believe there is an option which determines the best brick size based on certain parameters. I'm speaking primarily as a DAX trader which has high volatility most days but some of the forex pairs vary a lot day to day so I guess it makes sense to look at a brick size based on say ADR/ATR over a certain number of days and keep that under review on a daily/weekly basis. I don't think (unfortunately) that one size is gonna fit all.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Renko brick size is dependent upon the brokers spread only. I have a Broker that allows fixed spreads during the UK session and right afterwards the spreads varies within the US session. Now the general rule of the thumb (guidance only) is any spread below 10 use a 10 size brick. But the tricky part is the spread does not stay static unless its fixed....so you could be trading and all of the sudden the broker changes the spread (especially news periods) and bang there goes your brick size... trading is complicated and that's why a few make it due to the amount of complications. Open the MT4 Market Watch window, click a currency pair and opposite click and a separate window will pop up and click "spread". A third column will appear with the relevant currency pair spread size. It varies and so will your trading results.....

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I second Halley.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
If we consider a spread of two for example a ten pip brick is affected by 20% and a a 2 pip brick by 100%. You can either plan around a 20% hit on an initial move of one ten pip brick or a 100% impact on a 2 pip brick. If using smaller bricks gets you out from under the influence of the spread more quickly by reducing risk, locking in a quick profit and allowing smaller stops than that is fine. Like buying eggs by the dozen versus buying them one at a time. Spend the same money and you get a dozen eggs either way. Buy the eggs one at a time and you never risk dropping more than one of them at a time. Buy them by the dozen and risk dropping the whole lot. I have a friend who trades Renko very successfully and he uses the biggest brick size that he can. Again it is the way that you read the charts. The observations about RM and HH HL LL LH apply to any chart and it just becomes a matter of patience. On a Ten pip brick chart you can see one brick that lasts for many hours then a whole succession in a few minutes. On the larger brick sizes a single brick can last for ages. Larger bricks require larger stops. Smaller bricks move more quickly and need smaller stops and that is the appeal of the smaller brick size. My idea is to enter on a smaller scale and trade the larger bricks. ( I will get to a way to do that in due time, but it requires a future lesson in price action.) I will draw your attention the fact that every Renko chart has a M1 chart lurking behind it. Ovo and other Renko generators may also adjust brick size using the ATR. I am honestly not an expert on many of these things and still learning. I have experimented a lot and have made some very interesting discoveries that I am sharing (and will share more of) but there is obviously a lot more for me to learn about Renko. To illustrate. Here is a chart that shows all of the classical Alligator, RM, Saddle Points and larger degree HH HL LL LH count. The vertical dotted lines show the daily time frame. Brick size is 50 pips . Some days have as little as one brick and others ... even Brexit conforms to our price action structure. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you use 1000 pip bricks (go ahead and try it) you will cry because you didn't know where that red E line was on Brexit day. But, could you have afforded the stop to trade it? Not with such big bricks. So that requires a way to get in on smaller bricks which I will discuss in future posts. Think of trading an H1 chart and getting in to the trade on a M1 chart at the point where M1 turns and the whole time structure then follows: M5, M15, M30, and finally H1. All following the lead from M1. Can we do that with Renko? Stay tuned. We will get there, but more price structure to be learned first.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
If you are curious about how long a brick takes to form, you can put Renko AM on your Brick chart an it will tell you. Set the threshold to 880 and add some levels, 60 for H1, 240 for H4 etc. You will see at a glance how many bricks take eight hours or longer to form. Compare the time a brick takes to form in a trend/impulse wave versus a corrective wave and it is interesting. What we want to do is catch those trends. We don't really care about speed as much as distance. Having said that, no one wants to watch a brick that waffles around for eight hours.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Wab, Why are you discussing time when a Renko only works off of price action or movement. Time has no relevance and the only reason we use a M2 chart is to attach the Renko chart structure to an insufficient MT4 platform (it is free for a reason). The size of the brick should represent the spread only which enables exact positioning and representation of the actual currency pair in real-time (at the moment - real indicator). MT4 platform was originally designed as a time platform which is why its has M1 to Monthly time differences. Which is why most people discuss time frames - how many bars per the hour, etc. The only true indicator is price action everything is a lagging indicator (after the fact). Renko cleans up the excess noise (fluxuation of the market) and makes a bar based on the size and only closes after completing the size (exacting price action) - time is irrelevant). We are trend surfing the marketplace by using a price action tool (Renko) by monitoring 2 or more bricks and up to 10 bricks (on average) in one direction to enable the objective of capturing pips. Keep it simple and sweet with the least of amount of indicators. There are many people trying to design an EA with Renko but I believe you will run into reversing issues due to MT4 inadequacies which is why we have an EA converting MT4 chart into a Renko chart to begin with. Manual trading for retailer traders is king, small quantity of pips per day keep the debts at bay... an average trader can easily pick off 100+ pips per day off of the 3 main trading sessions if they are dedicated and disciplined. Thanks for listening, off on vacation now.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I am well aware of the time-free aspects of Renko charts and how M1 charts produce M2 Bricks. Nonetheless it takes time to form a brick and that is of some interest, especially if you are manually trading a Renko Chart. I brought time into the discussion because we were debating brick sizes and it is interesting to see that some 10 pip bricks take many hours to form. Even a very,very small sized brick can take over an hour to form on occasion. This thread is price action in regards to Renko and I introduced Road Map to help illustrate the concept. Once you are good at it, RM is not needed as you can soon visualize the chart structure with practice. At a future time (no pun intended) I will show you how to use that M1 chart as an aid to analysis and entry on a Renko Chart - not just as a generator of M2 charts. Check back in and follow along, it is a slow but steady journey to a few new ideas.

My mind has gone officially blind. Thank you. Just when I thought I can try and visualize some elements on my charts you came and stirred everything up all over again. I hope my aging mind can follow Still packing so not a lot of charts and I'm at work and can't connect to my home PC at the moment. As to Renko. I'm using the teeth and Fibo expansion to gauge E lines and forks, it has been hard but I think I'm getting somewhere with it. I have tried various brick sizes, smaller than 10 is a no go for me as I'm working all of LO and most of NY so I can't be glued to my cellular screen all day, everything is way too fast for me, I have seen nice HHLL formations on the 5 pips brick charts but the TP (and SL) are too small for my taste, those who can trade in lots can appreciate a 3 pips profit, me... well, I'm yet to build my capital. And there's work, of course, and the levels at which I can place pending orders and my broker's spread, all which makes trading lower brick sizes less appealing for me, not until I have some solid to work with and I'm still learning. I've also tried trading the ATR bricks, couldn't afford the big moves and everything was so slow that even the nice profits didn't cover for it, not for the losses and not for the time. So I'm trading a 21 pip brick charts now with mild success (until an EA or me not following the news wipe out said success) and I like this setup. Someone once told me that it's better to trade on weird brick sizes because when everyone is trading a 10 pip brick setup, they all see nearly the same things, given, of course, broker feeds differences. I hope I'll have the time to post the XAUUSD chart later on tonight (a 100 points brick size equals to a 1$ brick size), everything on it looks like counter trend in regards to the AO, yet the trend is eminent and I'm not sure how to read it. Wab, I'm not a coder, I can barely read code, but I think what you are looking for is inside the Out_TL function. It takes width as an input and looks for an impulse or else for outputting the lines. The regular is width 4 and the impulse is based off mas_ish_ZZ that I cannot comprehend. I'm still not sure how the creator came to calculate everything. I hope I'll have time to test all this new ideas. Always ready to improve and better myself. Thanks

Hello Rea. I know I have posted a lot of material but I think that lots of chart examples will help make it easier to follow the elusive structure. All of a sudden you see the structure and it gets easier to use it from there on. It is a bit like those pictures that you have to look at to see a hidden picture inside it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The various debates about brick sizes and so forth are of interest and I stand to learn as much as anyone in that respect.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
The problem with brick size is that volatility varies with market sentiment, some weeks a pair or instrument may be exhibiting soaring ADR, and later decline. I think it's best to be flexible with brick size, then to have a "MTF" approach. I just added the AO to my charts to see what difference it would make, and it looks promising, and the OVO Omnia Remote add-on makes it easy to switch between brick sizes as time frames. I prefer the Renko with wicks to the mean Renko, I have not been able to see the advantage in the mean renko. Here is an example of how the AO renders the trend and a copy of the AO indi used.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Then it turned again. I should have been in that short move but I like the move pulling back early on, so I stayed out, guess there were some orders waiting to be filled that the market makers could not resist.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hello All, Wab, thanks for the picture I never did that but it's one of the items on my bucket list. On with the charts. I switched to 10 pip bricks to be as close as possible to the narrative of this thread, I hope I can keep up with it. USDJPY Not a good entry, in my opinion, I, myself, would have waited for the previous -3 for an entry. Still running, let's see how far it can go. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURJPY A lot of trades, most of them are from my basket EA, the entries between -1 and -3 are the ones I've placed on this chart. I think it would have been better to wait for -4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) XAUUSD And than there's this. It's in a messy shape and I'm not sure how to trade it well. Attached Image (click to enlarge) [EDIT] Both USDJPY and EURJPY went to SL.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Don't know what happened. But sometimes you just get real lucky. Noticed a nice pin bar on the 15min chart which I run alongside my renko. Also the Higher brick size renko was giving the same reversal though not yet fully formed. Waited for the renko signal and placed a slightly larger than usual trade due that pin coming off the hi for the day. Placed a target that I thought might be possible due to divergence. Added a BIG percentage to my account in about 30 seconds. Just left my computer to close the door and stop the wind when Kapow! Money in the account. Wab there is a beer in my fridge for you if you ever get to Downunder. Glad it didn't go the other way! Stops are important to protect your account! Put my stop a bit above the last Hi. Trade well. I get the rest of the day off after that one.

Batavier, Nice move What brick size are you using? My looks very different than yours. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
It shows in the bottom left hand corner of his chart - it's 8 mean renko.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Thanks. Forgot he's using OVO's suite so it's like a regular 4 pips brick size, mine still looks nothing like his and choppy as hell. Maybe it's the broker and the Renko generator combined.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
OVO is well worth the investment IMHO. You can of course get a free 14 day trial to test it for yourself.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I did, didn't look anything like that nicely streamlined one in the screenshots here so I switched back to my old Renko generator.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Looks like we are getting chart examples. Bat I will take you up on t hat beer if I am ever in the neighborhood. What a nice trade. Rea I will try to get some info on your charts posted in a bit. I would go withe OVO if you can, then we are all using the same generator. Here is a 25 brick chart I was just in and out of. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I took the breakout at 1 after that nice Saddle point and unfortunately had my trailing stop set a bit too tight, so I was stopped out at 14. (I like the way we can identify those fractals with RM.) A fractal trailing stop would have been excellent here. Note how the Fib was very nice. Extending the Fib into a trend line is a useful trick too. I would wait for the Ten Pip Bricks to pull back to the Green E line on the Ten pip chart and try for an entry there but today is the opening of school and all we retired teachers are going to the "To Hell with Bell" breakfast. Later.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Just updates on my charts. EURJPY went on without me. USDJPY went on without me, placed some pending orders but didn't have the margin to carry them through (a martingail EA is eating up my balance). XAUDUSD..... nice ride, I'm still not sure how to trade it well. All charts are 10 pip bricks, the XAUUSD is a 100 points brick size.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Enjoy your breakfast, Wab! ))) What a catchy name.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Looking back at one of your charts Rea: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I would do the larger degree HH HL as illustrated. That way you know if you are trading into a correction or with the dominant trend. Also watch for those Saddle Points... classic Alligator trapped between two opposing fractals. Finally the AO divergence is a strong hint that the trend is changing. (That XAU breakout that you also showed is what we try to get.) BTW. Breakfast was great.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I missed this morning trade as I was preaching in the retirement village. (Some things are even more important than trading!) But check out how these two fibs worked. Gold for the first impulse wave. Black for the second. Very strong. Look how price reacted to gator teeth! There was no news to drive this move that I could find....so I expect it was the banks playing money making games. But the road map did show the way. Blessings Bat.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
NZDJPY I can't decipher where to enter. if I wait, it might be like USDJPY where I missed the move, if I don't it retraces. More on that later if I have the time.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
At a glance, blue is your trend and purple the counter trend. Try and figure where the next green E line will arrive (probably at blue 1) and monitor that.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
To work out my trading plan for today I zoomed right out and did the Elliot wave thing. Don't know if its correct but it looks good. Semafor settings period 1 0, Period 2 35, period 3 70. Now waiting for the B wave pullback and I'll hit C when the roadmap gives me some clues. Stalking the trade rather than punting.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
As long as you can recognize the trends and the counter trends and stay aligned with the trends, all will be fine. Try and keep an eye out for saddle points too. I have been doing some testing with smaller bricks. I am trying to tune them to my LOC trade manager and also to an ea that I am working on. However, I have been pretty busy with other things so not as much time as I want on those yet. Should have a chart or two to post soon.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Here is a demo trade, as I attempt to fine tune my trade manager. It is a counter trend trade. You can zoom out to see that, but I am trying to fine tune my trade manager - so lets see how that goes. I want to trade a 0.2 lot on each entry. After the price moves up 8 I want to take profit on half of the trade. I want the stop moved to lock in one pip of profit on the remaining 0.01 lot. I want a trailing stop to move up one pip behind each fractal that forms as the price moves on ... if it does. (I love LOC Partial for this type of thing.) So here is how this strategy is going: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I noticed a Saddle point between 3 and 4 and opened a trade above the reversal brick. I placed a pending order just above 1 . Both trades were filled and LOC placed a profit target up 8 above the entry. Both partial profits were hit and 0.01 of each lot was closed. The stops on the remaining 0.01 of each initial lot was moved up to lock in a pip of profit. A spike closed out one of those for a 1 pip profit. I placed a pending order at 5 to show where I would try for a third lot, but this is a counter trend so I won't follow through with it. Meanwhile I hope for a fractal at 6 . If I get that fractal LOC will move my stop up to one pip under 6 . I don't have to do much now, because LOC handles this so nicely. (I do need to experiment with the settings to get it working at peak efficiency. The spread is nice and tight so maybe it can be done with these small 25 bricks.) A little while later, a fractal forms at 6 and LOC moves the stop up to one pip under the fractal. A profit of 58 is locked in now on that last part of the trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will monitor the pending order at 5 . My potential red E line is at - 7 . (RM does not show that but I can figure it out by zooming out and looking at the higher degree structure. -7 is also the end of my Fib line. ) My stop gets hit. Now lets look at that Fib when we zoom out. (That is where the whole game plan is revealed.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) My trades all made a profit as price corrected towards that magic zone between 61.8 and 78.6% I felt that I was really in tune with this trade. I knew where to draw the Fib and expected it to correct to the 61.8 % level. That gave me enough room to try for a small profit. A good trade manager is a God send for this type of a trade. Next, I went short, below 6. and I will leave LOC to manage it. Let's see how that short works out tomorrow. Time for bed.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
is this setup works for any renko box size...or 4box size has some speciallty...??

--- 帖子 #616 ---
HH HL LL LH works on any chart. It is a bit easier to see on Renko Charts. Personally I use 10 pip bricks but I am experimenting with smaller bricks. Some people use bricks as small as 80 points (not 80 pips) and do well with it. Basically, it is a way to use Elliott Wave with minimal Elliott Waver counting. If you want to understand it you must read the whole thread, as it is a work in progress not a nicely packaged system. It requires study and thought. Have fun.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
SO how did my attempt to look really clever and leave LOC in charge work out? I was stopped out. If I had left the pending order at 1 it would have been filled, taken profit on half a lot at 8 and the rest of the trade would run on to the fractal at 14 before it stopped out with a profit of 26.4 pips - 1 pip for the trailing stop setting. A total of 26.2 counting the early 8 point profit. Here is the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It just shows that things can change and you have to adapt your thinking. Of course I was sleeping (have to do that sometimes) and taking a little chance. Sometimes that works so well, sometimes not. The point behind this was to show you how to use LOC as a trade manager. It doesn't think for you it just does as you tell it to. I could have left that pending buy at 1 and it would have performed flawlessly. It can't decide to do that for me, but it will follow instructions to the letter once I tell it what to do. I will see if I can catch a better one to illustrate LOC again but I have a busy day ahead, so maybe not until tonight.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Well I didn't wait until tonight. I am working on a wedding ring I have to have done today, but the market is nice and clear at this point Attached Image (click to enlarge) A quick zig zag counter trend and I was in short. I took the E line at -13 and adding two pending orders at -11 . All orders are filled, partial profit levels in place and trailing by fractals set. First trade is already stopped out with the LOC levels profits taken. One half at 8 and the other with a locked in pip. The two pending trades at -11 are at both locked in and have taken a half lot profit. Let's see how kind the fractal trailing is going to be. Back to work on that ring ... or a bride is not going to be happy on Saturday. (Ah romance ... got to love those last minute orders.)

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I have a question regarding your MM. Using partial closes, are you not worried about having only 1/2 of your original position exactly when the trade idea is working out? If you are wrong, you will get stopped out with "both" of your positions.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
... and we get a fractal stop. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A nice trade, three positions taken all took a profit at 8 and moved the stop to lock in a pip on the second half. The first trade from the red E line gets stopped out with two small profits. Trades 2 and 3 (pending orders at -1 ) went on to trail the fractals until stopped out at -6 and -8 ( A bit of slippage probably accounts for the different stops there.) Six profits taken on three entries. The point behind this is to show you that even on small bricks the structure is there. In fact it can even be traded on a M1 chart if you can get around the chunk the spread takes, but Renko is so much nicer. Now, I have to finish off that ring.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Carrying on with our 25 EURUSD chart. Here is the possible EW count - using the AO as a guide. The largest wave is Wave three . It has an internal divergence which is actually wave 3 4 5 on a smaller degree. The AO pulls back to a minimum of zero in a wave 4, then wave 5 follows and makes a larger AO divergence. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The market should move up now, likely sideways into a larger correction. Here is the zoomed out view... something that should always be checked. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #622 ---
The market has been in a lengthy sideways correction. I entered with a pending order at 1 LOC closed half that order after a move of 8 and moved the stop on the second half to lock in 1 pip. My initial stop loss is 8, so this strategy gives a bit better than a 1: 1 and still leaves that second half free to run. Attached Image (click to enlarge) All I am doing is trying to read the market and ambush it if it wanders into my traps. Maybe I will get another rally here and the stop will move up below a fractal at 8 if one forms there. No matter I can't lose on this trade now. I have my minimum target. I do expect a drop though and I have a pending sell order at - 6 and another one way back at -5 (where the larger degree wave would break out if it does.) I live in the Rockies which is a terrible time zone to live in when you want to catch the London Market. Trading is so much easier when it is moving and you can dance with it. When even small size bricks take 80 minutes or an hour to form, pending orders and a good trade manager are essential tools to have available. The Renko AM indicator tells me how long a brick takes to form and that also helps read the energy in the market at a glance. .

Hi All, Internet is back and I took some time away from unpacking and sorting things out. My charts for the day. AUDUSD Really itching to short it but not before -2 forms. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURCAD Not sure what to do with it, the -2 is much higher than I expected it to be. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURUSD Really itching to short it but not before -2 forms. Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZPJPY I'm hammering this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDCAD Looks like a nice, quick, counter trade is forming. Attached Image (click to enlarge) XAUUSD Trades from tonight. All three closed in profit or BE (the last one). Wab, are you familiar with a free trade management EA that can do fractal trailing stop? I'm a bit hesitant to pay 90$ for the LOC EA. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Before I look at your charts Rea, here is the final trade of my 25 (2.5 pip) EURUSD charts as I try to fine tune LOC to that brick size. (I used the EURUSD because it has a small spread.) This chart shows the power of trading the higher brick frame and using the RM and HH HL LL LH to help identify the entry points. This is very important chart. I set a pending order at the point where I was pretty certain the next down move would be confirmed. Then, I went to bed and left LOC to manage the trade if it happened. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This time I had it correct. The market messed around for about ten hours before the price filled my pending order. At that point LOC placed stops, took profit on the first half and moved my stop to lock in a pip on the second part. That took about four minutes to get into a none-losing trade position. The, LOC moved my stop down fractal by fractal, keeping it one pip above each new fractal at -6 -8 - 10 and finally stopping out at -12 . A nice run for a total of 29.5 pips. (The whole trade took about an hour and ten minutes.) Now here is the eye opener: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at the same chart on a 10 pip brick structure and see how easy the higher brick frame is to trade using a lower brick frame. The -1 fractal on the ten pip chart is the same one I used (on the -5 fractal) for the pending order on the 2.5 pip brick chart. Really study the above trades. Use a good management strategy. This will ramp up your scores. I can't monitor a chart for 10 hours to get an action for one hour - LOC saves me from having to do that.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi Rea. Looks like you are doing okay with your charts. AUDUSD ... yes watch for the - 1 and a reversal brick with a wick. EURCAD is likely going to break that previous high. check the AO. EURUSD check the AO again I think you are in a corrective wave and a bull trend will resume. NZDJPY is in a sideways consolidation but you are doing well. I would think a bull will resume. Watch the AO which is currently cutting back and forth over the zero line. USDCAD in a counter trend. Look at the bearish divergence on the AO. Could be a good short coming up. Good job on the XAU. AO says to be careful now as this was a counter trend and it is getting old. I don't know of any fractal trailing ea but I might know where to find one. You can achieve much the same results with a trailing stop loss on the green alligator line. I love LOC partial and think it worth the price, but test the ideas before you commit to anything. I will see if I can find that fractal trailer for you.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Maybe try this one Rea. http://fxrel.com/fractal-trailing-stop-expert-advisor/ You will have to experiment to see how it works. Good luck

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I modified the Road Map code a bit to change the line settings. I thickened the horizontal lines and thinned the heavy Zig Zag lines. It is a matter of personal choice but I didn't like the heavy diagonal lines on my charts. To me less clutter on a chart is more desirable as it is the price action that I am really interested in. I don't think of RM as an indicator as much as it is a good identifier of structure. The fact that it numbers each fractal, identifies many of the E lines and color codes the trends and counter-trends is a real bonus when it comes to discussing trades. The "skinny" version of RM is attached.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Just a little note on trailing stop strategies: In my opinion, there is no perfect strategy for trailing stops. I like to use a fractal stop or a trailing stop based on one of the Alligator moving averages. Usually the green lips line of the Alligator. I also like to trail a stop two bars + a pip. Which is best? Thanks to Bill Williams, the Alligator and Fractals are very well connected. In a corrective wave a Fractal stop holds up better - but we really shouldn't risk trading in corrective waves. In an impulse/trend wave there is little to chose between the Fractal Trailing stop and an Alligator Lips Trailing Stop. (I also like a partial profit option with my stop strategy, but that is just my preference. I am still weighing the pros and cons of that approach.) Here is a chart that shows how nicely and how closely the Fractal Stop and the Alligator Lips stops work. Sometimes one is a bit better than the other but that is the luck of the draw as far as I can determine. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In some future charts, I will use the Lips trailing stop to illustrate its use. I will be offline until Tuesday, so don't expect anything until then.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Thanks Wab, I'll post my charts later on today. Stupid EA ate up all the profits again, thankfully, some of my basket trades are still active so the account might survive this if I tread carefully. As for the Fractal EA, thanks but I already tested it, and it's not doing what I want it to do (it also went bat crazy when it needed to handle opposite trades on the same chart). I'll try the Alligator Jaws, they seem to keep a trade longer than the other two. Thanks. I'll be reading the last several pages over and over for the next few days.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
The Alligator trail works well in impulse wave, sometimes better than the Fractal Trailing. It doesn't work well in a corrective wave where the market has too many overlapping waves. So you have to get that impulse /correction, trend/counter trend, thing clear in your analysis.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Thanks. That is something I'm looking forward to working on.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Here are my charts. Stupid EA had managed, again. to vanquish all the profits so not a lot of trades. AUDUSD What a lovely move, not sure how to trade it now, though.

Thanks for tinkering with Road Map Rea. Most useful. I really have to learn more MQL. Here is a EURUSD 2.5 pips brick trade, using a 5 smoothed median shifted 3 (otherwise known as the Alligator's lips) trailing stop. I added a pip to give it a bit of room as that sometimes keeps you in for another wave. Note how LOC Partial takes profit on the first half at 1.12494 then trails the rest of the order until it is stopped by the green Lips line. By the way, I set LOC to take off half of the order, you have the option to take off any portion that you want to at any level that you select. Taking off a partial profit at a Fib target level and letting the rest trade on is something you can consider. You can also have move up a stop to lock in a whole trade at a Fib level, or wherever you select. It is very versatile. I like to lock in a no-loss profit as quickly as I can then, the rest is free trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe it will go lower, in which case a fractal trailing stop is better. Have to wait and see.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi Wab, Hope you had a nice time I was wondering about that 2.5 pips brick size. My broker doesn't allow placing orders too close to the price, and with my size of an account.... well, I aim for larger amount of pips because of the small order size. Wasn't your starting point a bit too early? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I did start a bit early. I actually used RM on the M1 chart to enter. The 2.5 or (25) brick size smooths out the M1 nicely. That way I can monitor the Renko Bricks and when I feel that they are going to follow a M1 HH HL LL LH I am in. We all develop our own methods and end up trading our understanding. Basically, I am trying to catch signals on Ten Pip Bricks such as reversal bricks, Saddle points and Fractal break outs, mostly in the direction of the trend. Then I trade them on the lower 2.5 brick frame. I only have to get a one brick move on the Ten to lock in a profit on the 2.5 and that is proving to be a nice combo. If the trade starts to look good on the Ten Brick Frame after a 2.5 entry, then you can carry on with it there.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Hi Wab, Didn't mean for it to sound like I'm putting you or your system down or anything, not being able to identify huge whipsaws is making me a bit bitchy at time, I apologize. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
NO problem Rea. FX is a beast at the best of times.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I wish I could this all the time: A nice down trend. The LBF (2.5 pip chart) tests the Alligator at 1 2 3 . Pending order where a new down trend would resume. ( I placed it at the bottom of the reversal brick at -23 . Go off and do other things. (Nice bike ride in the fall sunshine.) Pending order filled. Half profit taken and trade locked in. LOC trails the stop fractal by fractal. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I missed over half of that run but still got 56 pips. As I said - I wish I could do that every time.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi Wab Where was your initial SL? I think it was more than 8 pips. Perhaps the last LH?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
The closest I can come to a magic place for a stop is on the HH HL LL LH structure. Use the HH HL LL LH fractals as that is where the stop actually should be - recent LH for a bull or HL for a bear - plus a pip and spread. On these 2.5 pip bricks I set it to 8 pips on LOC. That generally does the job. A volatile market requires being flexible. If the stop is above the Alligator that is generally safe enough. However, I will move it to just past the previous Fractal if I feel the 8 pips can be hit. If it breaks that you have a reversal anyway. If you have LOC set to an 8 pip stop, you can just drag the stop to where you want it and LOC doesn't try to put it back at the 8 pip level. I think being flexible is required, at the risk of second guessing ourselves. A fixed stop allows you to have a pre-calculated trade size based on a percentage, but it is not always the best stop to use.

It would be good if some one could integrate the settings of the degree indicator in the road map Indicator.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Can you post the code for us to look at Eurix? Maybe we can figure out a match up between us. I pretty much wasted a bunch of time and effort on a Renko ea this week. So back to what I know works (for me anyway.) E line, Saddle point, trade away from the Alligator, use LOC to manage the trade. I don't really believe a robot can trade for me, although one can manage a trade after I pull the trigger. I am working on a sound alert for the reversal bricks.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Why fix it if it ain't broke? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I took a chance and added a second trade on at this recent bearish reversal bar. The first trade has 16 pips locked in now.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Here is a live example of how the 10 pip and 2.5 pip bricks compliment each other. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A bullish divergent brick forms on the 10 pip chart at 2 . Boss Fib has pulled back to 50%. An Alligator Squeeze (saddle point) occurs on the 2.5 pip chart. A green E line occurs on the 2.5 pip chart. AO is above zero - good for a long trade. I Used the signal from the 10 pip brick reversal to enter on the 2.5 pip chart with a pending order. Price moves up, trade opens, LOC locks in a profit on part of my position and the stop is moved to lock in a pip. Can't lose now. LOC waits the next pull back to place a stop below the down fractal that will form there. Price is up 18.8 pips and I can go and do other things while LOC handles this. Market looks very strong as the Alligator opens wide. Maybe it will break above 1 on the 10 pip chart and head for a Boss Fib target. I will update how it turns out.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Update on that EURUSD trade: The trade survived the weekend (barely) and went on to have a second rally. The stop stayed the same as the fractal pullback on Sunday formed just above the stop level at 8 pips profit. Then it pulled back a second time and hit the stop. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here comes the shoulda, woulda, coulda... If I woulda re-entered on the next bullish divergence brick I coulda had a nice trade trailing stops along the fractals right up to the ideal target stop at X. Or I shoulda taken profits on the second rally on Sunday. Trading is like that, perfect hindsight every time. At any rate, I did make 8 pips on half and the other half locked in 9 pips so, no loss and that is the important part. I also traded this live. If you aren't showing the live trades, warts and all, on a thread than it is a dubious thread in my opinion. Now, I am back experimenting with an ea that works on these principals. I don't really like eas but the challenge of developing a good one is always there. Have a good week everyone, with good trades. I will post as I get the chance.

Caught a tiger by the tail. I had a short open order and a second pending one. I was using a lips (green line) trailing stop. Wild ride. It dropped so fast the trailing stop was not even hit until a second retrace into the Alligator! My new candle alert sounded like a fire truck.

It has been quiet her for a week or two so I thought I would freshen things up a bit by going back to basics. Road Map is a great tool, but the best tool is always your own analysis. By using the higher degree of HH HL LL LH we can set up some very nice areas for trading in the dominant trend direction. Have a look at the current USDCAD chart that I have been working with. This is a five pip brick chart of the USDCAD. First, a count of the larger wave structure and identification of the green E line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then, trades taken using the brick reversal bar, but only taken in the dominant direction of the trend above the dominant E line. The Alligator tells you which direction to trade in, as a back up to the green E line. I used a strategy where I trailed a stop two bricks, plus a pip, back. I also take off a partial profit at five pips then move my stop up to lock in a pip on the second part of the trade lot when price has moved five pips. This results in lots of little profits and then the occasional ones that soar. Here is a zoomed-in view of the area that I actively traded in: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And, the results of all this are attached in a Word Doc. One trades is open as I write this. I Used to teach chemistry and the class sat up and paid attention when you were about to make something go bang. Not too many people who try to teach price action and actually trade it live in front of you like this. In my opinion, if your teachers don't offer live action examples they really are not much use to you. Anyone can count Elliott Waves in hindsight is a maxim we often hear. The key is understanding the universal HH HL LL LH structure of charts and being able to spot the E line in a reversal. Even with something as useful as Road Map and understanding some of the other indicators we have looked at (AO, AC, Alligator, MACD 5 34 5 ) you still need to be able to look at a bare chart and read that HH HL LL LH structure. Once you can read the chart structure you can plan a variety of strategies to reap the harvest that the dominant trend offers. You can see the higher degree waves and the internal waves and pick off entries and exits without trying to unravel a spaghetti mess of indicators - half of which don't agree on anything. I know it takes a while to get it but once you see it ...

Hi....this is a fantastic thread! There are several individual variations of the HH HL LL LH strats inside here I think! Would be great to have persons here to complete post template and indis they are using and brick size, rules for buy/sell and some picture examples! I trade with the 123PatternsV6 Alerts.mq4 and it works great!

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I have only just noticed that this thread is still alive. I already read up to page 26 and I found it to be one of the most enlightening threads that I came accros on FF. Can'twait to read the rest. Even if you don't trade this method it is still definatelty worth reading / studying.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Thanks for the compliments reteid2222. I looked at 123Patterns a while back and the method is similar in many respects. Counting the HH HL LL LH and being able to spot the reversal and E line eliminates the problem with the " ideal patterns and distorted patterns" in the 123 method. Last time I looked at the 123patterns V6 alerts. I couldn't get it to work. My MT4 froze. I assume that there is an updated indicator which I would appreciate you posting a link to it. I am always open to anything involving price action. Thanks. wizlon, I hope that your reading/studying helps with your trading. Learn to identify the E line correctly and you will be way ahead of most people. It comes with practice and then you can't not see it.

From post 650 by Wab "The key is understanding the universal HH HL LL LH structure of charts and being able to spot the E line in a reversal. Even with something as useful as Road Map and understanding some of the other indicators we have looked at (AO, AC, Alligator, MACD 5 34 5 ) you still need to be able to look at a bare chart and read that HH HL LL LH structure. " Absolutely true and fundamental to profitable trading. I've gone back to a simple line chart based on the close of the renko boxes. Structure is immediately apparent. Decisions are simple. KISS works best.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
WAB - way back in the thread I remember you saying that one of your favourite indis (signal line) no longer worked after an mt4 upgrade. Just for info it does work with the current build although we have come a long way since and it may be superfluous to requirements now.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I have taken the last version I found .....it was no 7 I think...modified it for my personal use to show only minimal information on chart and removed everything that was not neccessary specially formated the code : I u like it to have it I can post it here or as pm...but don t blame me cause I change the code in function and readability :-)

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Thanks handy148. I prefer to use the reversal brick. A lot of the indicators mentioned in the thread are what I call hand holders. They verify what you can see on your own, but once you can see it they are not needed. I will have a look at reteid2222 when she posts it (please.) It appears less intrusive than Road Map and may fit in with what we do here.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Here! Removed the zigzag file verification cause it doesn t work....and remove TP levels cause will need this space in the future development! And remove long not neccessary lines....and the option to show only X candles back the levels...to keep my chart clean....like my t-shirt :-) And copyright is also missing...but it was not my intention cause I wanted only to use it privately!

--- 帖子 #659 ---
This one I found....is also nice and shows only parts of breakouts where volume is high! I ll add this soon to the previous indi!

--- 帖子 #660 ---
retied2222, I still have a problem with the 123 patterns indicators crashing my MT4. Here is some 123 stuff by Joe Ross that I have looked over in the past. Really good stuff. The reversal brick and the Ross Hook are often one and the same. The show123 V2 seems to work without issues. It is interesting how many times different people arrive at the same destination via different paths. Only so many things actually work and we ultimately end up drawing the same conclusions.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
It is crashing cause you haven t the zigzag.ex4 in the 1-2-3 indi folder! Was also my problem...i have the new indi in multiple folders and have to copy the zigzag in every 1-2-3 indi folder!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
OK. Got it working. Will study it for a bit. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
And there is not way to prevent it from the code :-( Nice to see that is works for you!

--- 帖子 #631 ---
WAB - I have heaven knows how many 123 indis in my archive, far too many to upload here. If you want to pm me then I'll send to you if you want them.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Thanks Handy for a treasure trove of 123 indicators. I will test them as time allows. It has been very interesting with the election and the stars re-aligning as it were. As traders we should like volatility. I hope everyone is enjoying themselves and making some pips.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I think it's the best thread on this forum, thanks Wab! Is it possible to add alarms in the roadmap indi for the specified wave numbers? I prefer to look at 4, 6 and fakie -1 (so and vice versa) To be honest I have no idea how to impove your strategy, didn't find more profits by adding levels, big picture planning, PA etc. Currently testing combination with cluster volumes

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Thanks Iceberg. I appreciate the compliments. In regards to Road Map, I am not a great programmer with MQL. I tinker with it a bit and hit my limitations quickly. While I understand algorithms reasonably well, I have not mastered the MQL language. I think voice type alerts at the various RM numbers would be an inserting addition. I will have to think on that. However the hh hl ll lh analysis does not require anything but practice. Practice and also being aware of the higher degree HH HL LL LH, that is directing the smaller internal one. I introduced Road map, thinking that it might help people find the E line, which is in itself a part of another way that I look at the charts. (At some point I will expound on that - but probably not until after Christmas as my very busy season of jewelry making is upon me.) I have an earlier indicator that gives alerts on fractal breakouts that I will dig out and re-examine it. I had it custom written before I found RM. It does a similar thing and more. Combining it with RM is an interesting thought. I did not put this on the thread but I will look it over and see if it adds any useful content On and off, I have been trying to develop an ea strategy for all of this. It works amazingly except when it doesn't. Most eas seem to do that. You win on the roundabouts and lose more on the swings. So, apart from adding more price analysis, which explains why I call the E line the E line, and maybe a breakthrough on the ea end of things (if I ever get one) I think the material so far is starting to max out as it were. What I would like to see now is people sharing their charts. Once Christmas is past I will be more active with some new stuff on E lines that I think everyone will like. Meantime I will check in from time to time. (I haven't even had a chance to check all the 123 indis that Handy supplied yet. Busy, busy, busy ...)

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Great, looking forward for the new stuff. First idea coming to my mind regarding EA - it might be useful if the signal will appears on the small timefrime only if the price tests the E-line on the higher timeframe after true breakout. And we really need more charts discussion, here is my gbpusd (3pips) today Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Just to say it is one of the most valuable and short in the same time thread on FF for sure. Those 34 pages taking as much time to read as other threads here however with few hundreds pages instead and mostly not relevant garbage. Well I better start all over again..... By the way Thank you Wab for all these pointers and strategy.

I use geometrical renko, i only trade the 1 2 3 formating in the EUR USD, this is my trade today wait for the 1 2 3 formation enter with pending order on 2. Very simple

--- 帖子 #638 ---
this is the result

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Today trade 1 2 3 patern to the up side

--- 帖子 #640 ---
tantor, what indicators are you using on your main chart?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Very nice TanTor How big is your brick size?

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Geometrical renko 10 brick size and 12.5 shift

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Feb 17 very slow day and very choppy market today the best indicator is patience and wait for the formation of the pattern 123 patern. Market when up but it failed to break the hh, and it made a lh number 3 of the formation, this one i enter before the break of point 2 because of good momentum.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
All the indicators i use are for free in the forums of forex factory, after 2 yrs of reading difrent forums i selected the one that work for me, you should do the same read and read some more and choose the ones that work for you, i good advice trade price action and dont depend so much on indis. Good luck!!!

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi Tantor your Geometric Renko charts look great. I was searching for it on FF, but couldn't find. Would you be able to post it here. Thanks in advance Never mind found it For any body else interested here is the location http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=454060

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Thanks, TanTor, I know the indis are free, and I have seen quite a few over the last year just for Renko, and I've tried a lot of them -- some I use. I specifically would like the indi used in your offline chart that creates the green, light green, red, and light red colors for the Renko bricks. I know I can change candle/brick colors by going into the Chart Properties, but I don't know how to get the light green and light red shades together with the green and red on the same chart.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Entry at break of 3. TP at same distance as 2 to 3. Nice trade. Done for the day.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
The indicator is mcd candles from cja indicators

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
It would seem that this thread has reached a logical conclusion. Thank you to everyone who took part. I learned a lot and I hope I managed to share some of it. I will start a new thread to explore the BW line in more detail. We will need a anyone who can read and translate Russian to help out. Please join us at the Chuvashova Fork Trading discussion. Yes - there will be Renko content there too. Here is a teaser: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Wab, If has been more then a pleasure participating in this thread, I have learnt and grown a lot while reading and practicing. I thank you for that. Are you staying here or moving to a Russian board? I don't know Russian, I hope some of it will be in English, too. I want able to be adept in using the form when I tried it, would love to see your train of thoughts on the matter.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hi WAB, I have gain much insight on my trading journey from your contributions. Thank you. Alan

--- 帖子 #687 ---
The new thread will be in English, right here on Forex Factory. It is based on what I call the BW line and a Russian indicator that is pretty much similar. Thanks for the kind words. I should be up and running in a day or so.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Good to have you back Wab. Shame this thread isn't continuing but I'll be following your new stuff for sure.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Than you Wab for the effort to share your knowledge with us.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Looking forward to this! Keep up the great work Wab!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
The new thread is at https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...79#post9856779 You will find a lot of familiar material applied to non-Renko, time-based charts. I look forward to the discussion and learning that will happen there for both myself and anyone dropping in. Thanks to everybody who helped out with this one.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Does anyone know how to superimpose or simply put a moving average over a Momentum 14 indicator? Momentum indicator can be viewed as a forward indicator because it records acceleration in price movement, not price movement itself. In an up trend, then the indicator turns down it means the acceleration of the price is slowing, decreasing or stopped. This is a successful indicator to know when to get out of the trade ( and to get into one if the conditions are right) If I can paint a MA over the indicator line it would smooth out the line and provide a better signal. It may also be used as a "signal" line, as in MACD. Cheers AlGer

EURIX OKAY that is easy to do. Only one problem. my MT4, only has apply to: Close, Open, High, Low Median price, Typical Price, and Wieghted close. It does not have previous indicator data, or current indicator data. Is that MT5 you have showing?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
you have to drag the moving average into the sub-window. open the side navigator window, under "Trend" find moving average then drag it into the indicator window.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
No its Mt4 and you have to take the MA from here

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Wow, that worked !! Just goes to show , I learn something new every day ! I didn't know that before, THANKS TO both of you. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I love it when a plan comes together. Using the E line on 2 point range bar charts for scalping. (this is my version of the tick chart) Thanks Wab Works very nicely but you do need lightning reflexes.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Nice trade Bat.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I have been asked by some viewers to continue this thread. After some thought, I decided that I will share some new Renko material and new ideas that I am using as they fit well here. It will take me a bit of time to organize, so stay tuned as they say. The short Canadian summer is drawing to a close and the smoke is still heavy from the forest fires. As the weather changes and I am indoors more the Forex Journey will more time devoted to it.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks Wab - looking forward to it.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Renko fan here, i hope it will be something different

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hey guys, almost done reading this thread. one question, Web sir, is there a continuation of this?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Not yet. I am working on some new stuff that I will post if it pans out.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Happy New Decade: It's hard to believe that it has been over two years since I last posted here. A lot has happened since then and my trading ideas have developed along with some new ways of looking at Renko. In particular, I am really interested in what amounts to my current attempt to look at Renko a bit differently. (Differently for me anyway.) I hope to get the discussion going again and will try to explain my new thinking on the topic; some new ideas built on the old tried and tested ones, some very new stuff as well. I will start off with a new indicator that I think people will really like, once I get it working as well a I can. Meantime, if you haven't read the preceding thread materials, do what I am going to do, re-read the whole thing to get my mind in gear again. See you in a bit.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thanks Wab! Looking forward to reading you again..!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Well here it is. Thank you to everyone who has helped me out with this thread. Animal Farm has done its job now and a new thread that will sort out the good material here and continue with those ideas and teach new material has been started. If you have read over Animal Farm you are well on your way to some new and interesting materials. The new thread is called Renkology. I hope it becomes a very useful resource for a us all to use. See you there. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/1051233-renkology
