Hello Everyone, Greetings from Varun Please Don't ask or post without reading this till the end. Whatsoever the people say, the fact is majority of the people lose money in FOREX, and that's true. It involves huge amount of risk, chances of getting bankrupt is more, you can lose your pants and can find it nowhere else but at the same time it is much more profitable involves least amount of risk and it can get your desires fulfill immediately IF DONE THE RIGHT WAY. Before I proceed further, Let me introduce myself. My name is Varun, I live in Canada but most of the time I travel throughout the world. I trade Forex to support myself and my dreams. To keep it short, I have gone through all the stages, a trader face (most of them ) in this world of Forex, and now I make some amount of profit trading Forex in a consistent way. Reason for putting this system on Forex Faactory : This strategy is not a "Holy grail" but it does makes some decent profit. In 2012 I started "Gambling" (analyzing after placing trade) and use to come to this forum, just to see if any high impact member have posted something positive about the currency pair on which I was loosing terribly. Coming to the present time I realized there are still a bunch of traders who do the same, So I gave it a thought to share this with you all, and here it is. Don't prove me wrong Just before you proceed to download the system, I want to share few words with you. If a person tries to help the society, community or even the entire world to the level best he can, at least he should not be criticized, he is not asking for anything but making you better by spending his time, efforts and the knowledge he gained. This is not for most of the people reading this thread but particularly a few ready to indulge them self for a fight to prove the person wrong and guilty for no reason and it makes no sense. I hope you understand and will not do this. What else can make you a better trader. Believe me or not, but if you lead a haphazard life you will get the results accordingly, Positive thinking is one of the most important aspect of anything, I'm sharing few things (listed bellow) what I do and suggest you to do the same and it will be an extra add-on to your results. *Live a Healthy Life *watch some inspirational videos every morning to keep you get going. * Do not watch your trades every hour, it will only give you heart attacks and nothing else. * whenever you make an entry make sure the candle is closed, Its better to leave few pips than of loosing. * This or any other strategy out there is not at all a buy sell signal giving system and you should enter the trade accordingly. *Do some research before you enter, having done that will not make you fear when you are not in front of your Desk. * Have your sentiments for the entire week before it even starts. These are the few things you should take a note of which will make you a better trader. Money Management : In Business Management is all pervasive, Anything - Management = Zero. Having a strategic money management can make you some money even if your loosing trades are more than your winning, I highly recommend to use the money management strategy and not to put any amount of lot even if you are very much confident, if you want to do so, open a demo or have enough first to play with it. I divide MM into 4 stages which is followed every month. 1st Week - 0.01 Lot for every $200 2nd week - 0.01 Lot for every $100 3rd week - 0.02 Lot for every $100 4th week - 0.03 Lot for every $100 Rinse, Repeat Indicators Used in this system How to install - Click Here Moving Averages - 34 SMA, 55SMA, and 200 EMA. Stoch - 10,3,3 Zigzag - 12,5,3 The simpler the better Idea behind this strategy. Forex is not a rocket science, everything works with some principles and so does Forex. The system is simple, you just need to look at a glance if the market is creating HH,HL's or LL,LH's. Newbies Click here . To determine the (HH,HL's) and (LL,LH's) we use Stoch and Zigzag, the Stoch when crosses bellow 30, it creates LL or HL and when it crosses above 70 it creates HH OR LH , the next step is to find the entry point for this we use moving averages, Once we get a Setup we switch to lower time frame for an entry and once the MA'S are broken you enter the trade few pips bellow or above the candle close. Now, I use some extra inidi's to filter out some bad trades which I will be explaining as we proceed, You first need to practice and master the basic, too much of knowledge at once is a no go. Entry Rules: Once you have a visual representation of market giving you higher high's, higher low's and vise versa, looking at the stoch to determine the turning points we switch to the lower TF and let the candle cross all the MA'S, once it does we enter few pips above or bellow. Yhe! It's that simple Exit (Stop Loss and trailing Stop loss, Take profit ) The recent swing high of 1 hr Chart is you initial stop loss, once the price starts moving in favor of you start trailing your Stop Loss, always remember little drops of water make the mighty ocean. Keep your initial TP to the weekly levels. (I am nowhere affiliated to this but I highly recommend to use a paid indi called Pivot Prof which I was recommended by maxdoom, no description everyone knows what he is #respect). since then I have never used any other. His words which are mine too now " It will Pay for itself", apart from this you can also use the provided heiken to make it work as your tp, stay in the trade untill it changes its color and re-enter once again. The benefits of using this system *It will keep you out of bad trades *It will give you an exact SL which you need not to hunt for, *Highly Profitable, I make 1000's of pips every month using this system as a base after my analysis, my live TE is always there on my profile though it is not my actual Live account but it is a live account. *you can enjoy your life without having to sit for hours in front of your desk. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ You Must not copy mine or anyone's signal blindly, do your own research and analysis. Once time passes you will become master. Do post your charts to help other understand the system better as time will pass I'll teach you, how to make more and more of pips using the initial strategy. Final Words : Few years back we never knew that one day forex will exist and we can make money from it, who knows what else and better may come tomorrow so always keep a positive approach for the community and share what so ever you feel like beneficial for others, any types of charts are welcomed just don't make it so confusing be calm and kind help others and stay healthy. Success will be yours. V NOTE* - The bellow examples are of the current week (29-4th of feb 2016) and just an estimate of pips you could have made without getting your SL Hit, also the previous thread had become a mess and place of confusion so I created a new one, I will ask the moderators to delete it and request everyone to post here and I apologize to everyone I could not reply due to my busy schedule, now I'll make sure I'll reply to everyone. If you have any query feel free to reach me out @ - dashv76 Good Day

Awesome job Varun, I just subscribed myself back. It is indeed clean and nice to find all your strategy and files in one place at the beginning. I agree your last thread got busy and confusing, but it does have a lot of info and brain dump. Also, it did clarify a lot of doubts and questions. If you deleted that now, that cycle may start all over again. May I suggest freezing that post without deleting it ? No one will be able to post but it will be available for reading and understanding. Of course, you are probably the best judge.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thankyou so much for your kind words, it won't be a problem for me to repete everything in better way, since I have already asked the moderatirs for post cleanup, I like your suggestion, will try to keep it on hold even if not, I'm always there to clarify. Welcome to the team V

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for this system, it will be the first one I ever attempt to learn as I've never done any real manual trading worth mentioning. So forgive me if I'm way off here Assuming today weren't Friday, would this be a long on USDCHF right now? If not how come? If so, do you ever take trades on Fridays?

*Highly Profitable, I make 1000's of pips every month using this system as a base after my analysis, my live TE is always there on my profile though it is not my actual Live account but it is a live account. how long have you tested this system? can you say it makes money consistently. secondly, how do you handle news hours.?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
hello varun, you show me exactly as you enter the market? in what position you must find stochastic, the stop loss and takeprofit?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Varun,thank you again, with your 0.01 lot for every $200, how many pairs do you need to trade with this lot?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Welcome knitex , This system will definitely show its potential, and will prove worth trying, UChf check my te it was a looser though at a glance it looks choppy and I have crossed mark this pair above in the examples. V

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hey friend, Welcome to this thread, I have been using this system since years and it proved to be one of the most consistent and profitable one, for newz I don't care, 90% of the time the price moves in favor of trade, check my te, today only I made decent amount of pips with gnzd and gaud during peak time it just moved in favor of me, and newz do not effect on trades taken from larger tf, I keep my Sl tight during this hours though. V

--- 帖子 #10 ---
A live example would be better, hold on till next week we'll trade together, I,ll point the exact entry. don't worry I'm always there for you V

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thank you for your sharing! I love its simplicity. Although I will continue to stick to 10, 50 and 200 EMA, I will look forward to adopt its idea onto my own system...

--- 帖子 #12 ---
For newbies I, recommend not to have more then 4 trades opened at a time and only to take the best one instead of all. Every single trade will count big on you're account. V

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I wish you luck and great success Mate, do well. V

Hello V, and thanks for sharing! Is E/C short right now? If not, why not? All the best! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Ok, so the ZigZag in the H4 is too choppy and is best to just avoid and wait for a better spot? Gotcha!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
subscribed.... seems very simple although ur entry and exit is unclear to me....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Exactly Zigzag is an extra add-on, to gove you nice visual. Good going K. V

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I am happy to hear that you are really a man of a great heart. I appreciate your willingness to help other people who are in need of help. I think I am.now.fully understand your strategy and I will practice again in.my demo and will.come.back to my real account when I can control myself not to gamble with forex. Will keep an eye of all your posts.. Thanks again for this thread.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Its valid if it breaks all MA's, head over to top down Analysis on Interactive section you will get a better picture. V

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Can you please look at AUDJPY? i see it as a perfect set up but when to enter?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Lol, it was 2 Am here when I wrote this, needed some sleep, but no worries next week will give you a clear entry. V

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Thankyou so much for your kind words, try to post your charts here if possible 😊 V

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hello Varun Thank you for your sharing. Through your system I have finally found the right way of reading charts. I can't thank you enough to have helped me with this insight. God bless you Varun. Happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
You're welcome Chris, there's a lot more good stuff to be added here in future, stay updated I wish you success V

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Great thread and easy to follow strategy....thanks V Could I kindly ask a quick question...Do you pay any attention to the Stoch on the lower (1H) tf to refine entries at all?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thankyou gwindy, Not at all. I don't care about stoch in 1hr tf, but its better to enter short when the stoch comming from top and vise versa. V

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Can you pls explain further the meaning of the above MM system.......tnx

--- 帖子 #28 ---
i would like to say many thanks for the advice Mr. Varun by giving strength and encouragement to move on. thanks once again Sir

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi V Thanks for the sharing, subscribed I am also unclear of the exact entry and exit point, and also can you share with us the reason for the MM to be increasing this way for each week? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Uploaded a screenshot as a practice. According to H4 chart, it has reach LL and LH with the zigzag stopping at one bar before. This might be a little weak and preffered to see a few bar mores to confirm LH. Assuming that it is LH, and the stochastic is currently above 70, then i'll proceed to H1 chart. Currently the price is above all MA, I should only sell when price go below these MA, ignoring stochastic in 1H chart, is this analysis correct?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
hello varun. thank you for sharing great system . . .i have question. . .what pair should i trade?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hey fx, Its very simple and recommended for newbies with a conservative approach Say , you have $1000 to start, here what you should follow for a month. Month 1 initial Balance $1000 1st week - 0.01 for every $200 = 0.05 Lot per trade, and assume you made $100 (forget it) 2nd week - 0.01 for every $100 = 0.10 Lot per trade, assume you made $200 (again forget it ) 3rd week - 0.02 - for every $100 = 0.15 Lot per trade, assume you made $300 (forget it once again) 4th week - 0.03 for every $100 = 0.20 Lot per trade, assume you made $400 ( forget it for the last time) (People with conservative approach may continue with 3rd week's Lot per trade) Month Two Initial Balance $2000 Rinse and Repeat. I have created this strategy keeping in mind the system's outcome, For few it may bit aggressive, so you may use the 1st week's Lot per trade throughout the month. Hope its clear now, V

Thanks for your kind words Gold, I will try my best till I can V

--- 帖子 #33 ---
varun thanks and excuse my English, I'm Italian and I do the translation with google translate, sometimes I do not understand what you say, next week I will be careful in everything you do

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello varun76, thanks for insteresting strategy. Do you already forward trade it? Please kindly share the trade explorer

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I predict we will have a awesome thread here ... Wish you all the best Varun!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Varun76, Thank you for your great system. I like it specially because you can use it in different pairs, and it seems to perform well in all of them! I have read the whole thread, and I still have some doubts regarding the TP that we should use. In the first thread you talked about three options for seting the TP level. Here comes a summary of some of my questions: - Use weekly levels -&gt; I assume you mean using R/S levels of the weekly TF. Why weekly and not Daily or H4 levels? - Use Pivot Prof indicator -&gt; I am still learning, and would like to keep my small budget for a future live account. Do you know any other similar indicator with similar features? - Use Heiken candles -&gt; I have experienced how the candles change the colour for only 1 or 2 candles, and then continue the tendency. I don't find it totally useful. One more question: You talk about using the Trailing Stop once the market moves in your favour. How many pips do you use as TL? Do you move the SL to BE at a certain profit level or only use Trailing Stop? I would appreciate if you could help me solving my questions of TP and TL. Thanks for your great support! Regards

As long as no one is coming here and post their own improvised version and EAs.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Well said! Lets just stick the rules and support varun76 for his generous effort. Good work varun! Regards

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Agree 100% ... but sadly we have no control on that ...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
hi varun, i see you are moving here, subscribed again i am interested to know how other traders think (especially the profitable one).. btw have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hey Varun. I am a new forex trader, learning with a demo account for last 4 months. I will use your trading system soon but need some help. Do you have skype etc.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Varun Subscribed in your new thread Next week going to give it a try. Got a question - Do you think its a valid entry?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I think it's a valid entry. Just another words, as everything, there is not any 100%, and this is a loss trade if you entered

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Subscribed

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hey Hovedguy, Many thanks for giving it a try with Reference to your query, I would not take this trade because stoch never crossed the 30 level with the broker I use for my analysis, and maybe that's one reason I recommend FOREX.COM for analysis. I use Alpari as my Live account but never do any analysis on the mt4 provided by them, and also if you notice the Daily chart is in short of ranging zone, so I would have given a thought before entering V

--- 帖子 #47 ---
keeping everything else apart, Indeed its a wonderful setup but see in H1 chart, it never gave you an entry, that's why I like this strategy so much No false entry (very rarely)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hey M, almost anything you can consider which you can get on MT4. V

--- 帖子 #49 ---
No Problem Mickal, I can use google translator to clear any doubt if you have V

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I have provided a TE on my profile, I'll make sure from now to take only those trades which are taken on my personal account. V

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Many thanks FerruFx, You're presence will keep the thread out of any technical issues. I will always look forward to here from you V

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thanks very much for your response. I will keep in mind about the broker data mismatch. Do you want to see a clear leg / trend in daily or weekly tf in the direction of entry for additional filtering?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hoved, There was a Trendline, PA Rejected third time there if you see in below image. 3rd Touch. So not a valid entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Its very simple, but If I explain it now it will get over your head. A live example would be better, let the week start, everything will be clear V

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Also, if you please clarify another noob query.... when price reached to yellow rectangle area, zigzag indi will reform and make a new LH. Is it advised to ignore the previous short term swings high and low (though ZZ didn't draw them but to its quiet clear swing isnt? I wish somebody did take that trade

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Spot on Anonymous.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hoved, Yes you can take that entry if all criteria was met in H1 TF.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
thans R, you too have a great weekend. will be waiting for you on monday Take care V

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Thanks Mario and Morican, I appreciate it V

--- 帖子 #60 ---
My friend, As I said before, there is not anything exactly 100%. Some valid signal could lead you to loss. But some similar to valid signal can give you a really good trade. Finally, we have a proverb: "Success always need a little luck". It based on you . BTW, with your example, with USDCAD With me, on H4, this is not a valid signal. But you can switch to H1. I am sure after that point, you can found a SELL signal (Ofcouse it's must a valid signal) And on another hand, you already have a confirm from higher tf H4: Price already failed to made a higher high at yellow rectangle area.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Being Honest, I never use zigzag I hate it. second in such case look for divergence, If you go over my previous thread you will know how I do it, have used the same example V

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Actually GMT+3 is de fecto standard server time in forex market. ( Forex.com is GMT+0). This specially matters when we trade based on 4H chart. Also, when we use pivots, it's important to get accurate pivot levels. The quick list of GMT+3 server brokers are listed below: ThinkForex IC Markets Alpari UK FXCM Axi Trader FX Pro Vantage FX UK Pepperstone Global Prime Hot Forex FX Open Go Markets Broker dependency doesn't make sense to me.....

--- 帖子 #63 ---
So, its a valid one... Thanks Hi Varun I tried to find, no luck. Then only one I found is this . Could you please post the link? Thanks Hoved

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Here you go, http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...48#post8774748 and this http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...80#post8775680 V

Indeed, it just gives you an extra edge to your trading, and BDW than's for the explanation its good V

--- 帖子 #66 ---
(Explosion of pips) (works like charm) ?? The name is getting shorter Varun:nerd: Good system anyway, Keep it up.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I could not get an answer ready to the question, where's the Explosion, may be that's one Reason Cheers V

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thank you. Alright, last question before I start trading in real time Do we have a skype group in place?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I like your idea A Skype group for Dynamite system.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Its a great idea H, Ducdaovn jut messaged me about this, I'll make it today itself and will put it on the main post Cheers V

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Awesome

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thank you Varun for share ! Wish the best for you! subscribed!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
nice idea! i am a follower!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thanks arya, I wish you the same V

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I hope it was a right understanding!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Not valid signal.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Arya I recommend you to use the provided tlp, ppl wil get confule otherwise V

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Your stoch levels (80, 20) are not what V uses.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hey Varun, I have a quick question. I know it is not mentioned but figured it is worth the clarification. Does crossing of the 2 SMAs play any role in your trade setup ? I see hope here since my wins have not been impressive or big and the losses tend to take away the miniscule profits I make. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Thankyou mates! is it right position?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
A Skype group would be a great idea, bore this week I have never looked at a trading chart before, even with the easy easy instructions by varun I still dont understand enough, I think a Skype group or live videos showing stage by stage would be great for a complete beginner like myself. Great work varun your a star.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
yup.... how are you planning to exit?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi V, I think we've got something for monday? Regards

--- 帖子 #85 ---
maybe as varun's suggestion using heiken color! do u have better choice?!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
And can we consıder this as a plus? ( Daily TF ) Regards

--- 帖子 #87 ---
cool..

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Varun, I'm trying to read the 1st post. Something I dont understand, is the red arrow correct ?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
very nice result I'll try to FT it this week.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
hello Varun, now that's a nice idea, it would be a nice video where you explain your operations, the set up better H4 and H1, tp, Sl

--- 帖子 #92 ---
at strong support.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes, I questioned that as well.....Nice job V!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi morican. I asked the same question before, and answer was: Its valid if it breaks all MA's (on H4 never did..)

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hey ft16, No, I just use the Ma's for entry and for a general boundary line you can say, Here is an example of GNZD I took last Friday, though it was crazy but it moved in favor V

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Absolutely, you going great I asked others through PM, they are little worried about there privacy, which does makes sense, A bucket full of water can be colored with just one drop of Ink I was also not in favor to short this pair but after the 200 Ema rejection on Daily with reference to oil price i'll keep an eye on it, I have posted about in on Bone's thread (top down analysis) When I saw that n phone, I thought its a typo, but I am referring what we can have when the stoch comes bellow 30, may be a LL or a HL and vise versa , Watch the chart Int the given example, I would better call it LL,LH,HL instead of just HH,HL I'll be waiting for your charts man In coming days I will, Hope its clear now V

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Forex is a game of no, Here's how I use it for my entry and and how would I trail a trade, also note the break of whole no marked as green it would be a perfect entry.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Varun, same as your chart above before it went long, Did you made a sell with this pair and how did you manage it? It seems it was a loss. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Indeed, It was but I did not took it, and here's when the advanse stuffs come to play, I told in ny previous posts, I use this as a base after my analysis, apart from this rhere are few more things which gave me a signal not to enter short as we proceed, I'll explain with live examples Great day Mario V

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I think, this is one of the BEST thread, I come across. Varun, thanks and yes, this exploits the market enough to have decent profits. again, the KEY is the ACTION VERB called, discipline .

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hello Varun, you did not reply to my question.. nvm If you start a skype group about your trading method, please PM me too as I want to learn this. Thanks in advance and I am subscribed last night

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I like your words and the way you posted nice BDW a lot more to be added to this stay updated. v

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Varun, this is a good example to learn why short was not taken. Looking forward to learn from you. Thank you for your patience.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thank you Varun. Looking forward to learn it. I think this is very important to know when to and when not to enter.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Awesome job Varun

Hi V, Yes, all clear now, thank you Regards

Aahh! The fresh optimism of a new thread is invigorating. Let's see what the week brings. Thanks V ☺

Thanks Varun for showing your skills! Your MA´s are very similar with "the dance/ Choros" set up .. a 35 Sma , 50 ema.. a and a H4 " 50 "( 200 ) as well ... Specially the basic priceaction is very important.. and I like your analyses... Nice thread.. subscribed ... Guido

Very interesting, I`m subscribed to this Post I`ll hope to learn a lott here, I`ve read the entire Post but still i found it diffucult when to enter the trade. Hope i`ll see coming week moren excamples when to start and where to put the tp/ sl Greetings From the Netherlands Erwin

&amp;quot;*Have your sentiments for the entire week before it even starts&amp;quot; Interested if you'd like to share, cheers☺

--- 帖子 #119 ---
So do we check our Signal on H4 and trade on H1 ?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Sure do! Stoch and price action on h4, crossing MAs on h1, simple!☺

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Anyone buying AUDNZD right now?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Price hasn't crossed MAs on H1 yet

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Is there still use for Stoch 5,3,3? I noticed only Stoch 10,3,3 on the H4 chart. In Forex Dynamite Explosion of Pips, separation of Stoch(5,3,3,) in H4 served as confluence for over bought and over sold signal on Stoch(10,3,3).....

--- 帖子 #124 ---
No mention here, so keep it simple I guess atm. ☺

--- 帖子 #125 ---
LET'S GO BACK TO TIME Mar 4 0:00 At H4 chart, HL is happened, stoc is below 30, then we go to H1 chart to search for buy entry, at time 15:00, the price cross up the MAs with 5 pips more, the entry Buy is at about 1.0934, SL at 1.0885 (last swing low in H1). The SL will be just triggered at Mar 7 0:00. Lost is 79 pips. Am I right? Dear V, hope to learn more from you, how to prevent such lost? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Maybe in the next few hours...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Nice mate. Maybe after london open it will be up.

Eu ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) or : Attached Image (click to enlarge)

There may be other factors, such as daily resistance, which may have kept you out of the trade, but at the end of the day you will have losers and winners. At least you can cut losers relatively early with this system and pick up trends along the way. ☺

If H1 breaks all MAs, it is a buy signal by the rules. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #171 ---
GBPNZD 1/ It's still not a valid BUY setup in H4 2/ If you switch to H1, you will see SELL setup already there... 3/ and on M30, price very close to break all MA* and go to SELL trigger. All the best!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Quite possible. All you need to do is go over charts every 4 hour and take notes which ones present a potential setup. This takes only 5-10 minutes for 35-40 pairs for a trained eye. Or follow fewer pairs. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Checking for setups with your own eyes is more reliable than any indicator On mobile platform it's easy to tap through the charts. And you get fast at seeing setups. On MT4 Desktop, you can leave the 28 major charts open -- to flip quickly with Ctrl-Tab . That said, there is a Helper indicator on the older thread you can find, but please do not link. Varun did not mention it, so I am sure he prefers us to use our eyes &amp; brains only, like he does.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Go to Post 1 and see Varun's GBPJPY chart for buy setup. It is exactly the same. So it is a buy setup. There was a sell setup last week on H4 and triggered at 2.1014. Until 2.08292 is breached, we accept the recent low as HL. So, it is buy setup. It is definitely not a sell setup as H4 stoch is below 70. I don't care about M30 as it is not by the rules to follow M30 chart. It seems you need to reread Post #1. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #175 ---
GJ shows HH- HL on H4, therefore you need to look for a buy setup not sell. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Blackeagle, If it is a HL and crosses 30 on stoch then it is a buy signal and if it is a LH and crosess 70 it is sell signal is that correct, depending on a trend shown on H4 TF ?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello Varun, Thank You Very Much!!! For this support and guidance, I have started following you and the thread today as I came across it and I truly must say that reading all the post here shows the incredible potential for us to learn. Much Appreciated.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
From Varun's point of view, it is correct. But from pure technical analysis point of view, if you look at GBPNZD H4 chart, the trend is down and March 2nd top is LH. Then when stoch dips below 30 during retrace and price breaks all MAs on H1, Varun assumes HL is in place to catch trend change in its initial stage. Normally this is a bit risky because according to Dow theory, upward trend is a series of successively higher highs and lower highs as shown below: Varun assumes uptrend starts at 3 (when price breaks all MAs on H1), but normally it starts after price penetrates 2. That's his definition of trend and I respect it. If you would like to trade this strategy for established trends, then you should look for an entry after 5, after confirming LH - HL - HH (2-3-4 on diagram). Hope this helps. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #179 ---
In 4 hour tf its making LH, so no Buy signal

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks a Lot for clearing that for me. So looking on GBPNZD as of right now the buy signal is valid and we can get in trade once one of the candle closes above all the EMA's right? Which hasn't occurred yet but eventually wiLl.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I suggest you read Dow theory first, learn what is LH, HH, HL, HH, study the above diagram I posted (and of course its opposite one for downtrend) and compare it with current GJ H4 chart which is currently trying to form Higher Low (HL). On the other hand, buy setup does not mean buy signal. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #182 ---
H4 chart satisfies all the rules. When H1 candle closes above all MAs, we'll buy GBPNZD from high of the candle + 5 pips. We don't know if it will eventually close above all MAs. You need to act based on facts not assumptions or emotions. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi Pip, I hope its not too late, I think we should be looking for buy setups....... Cheers....

so whats the signal? you said you are following the strategy, But the exact rule didnt appear yet and why sell? I think you are now confusing us. If you enter based on your own rule better not to post to avoid arguments like this. Even in M30, i dont see any price closed below MAs.

I following the strategy. BTW, this strategy - The Dynamic strategy is a part of my system. @All: If you don't like me, stop read this post here, anyway, if you want any advice from me... 1/When any pair goes to OverBought/OverSold, what do you think? Maybe it will come back. Or it will break out to create new TOP/BOT... You have to analyze. 2/Trend is always your friend. This is my core system. Your work is: - Define TREND - Analyze pair will breakout to create new top/bottom or pull back..

Very impressive return Duc. Are you a trader by profession ? I seem to be missing setups as I have to be at my day job. Also I have noticed that the MT4 mobile is not in sync with the one on your desktop. So I think it is risky trying to trade on your mobile app. Ciao

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Foxtrader I guess you are mixing it up a bit the strategy I mean, if you have a quick look on the strategy written on the first page you will come across following To determine the (HH,HL's) and (LL,LH's) we use Stoch and Zigzag, the Stoch when crosses bellow 30, it creates LL or HL and when it crosses above 70 it creates HH OR LH--------- considering this stoch is only used to define whether it is a LL or HL or HH or LH in the case of EURNZD stoch was in oversold(below 30) suggesting a LL or LH, looking at the market one can depict that it is a lower low hence the H4 short signal all valid after this now all you gotta do is wait for the market to actually close below all the EMA's on H1. That's the best I can describe I guess atleast that's how I understand the strategy.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
You can see signal SELL EURNZD here. Don't leve Dynamite alone, mix it with some other filters. All trade closed just because I close today's basket. 50% profit a day is enough with me. Max Drawdown? At this time MaxProfitDrawdown is -64 (You can take a look at my TE). I am sure, in the near future , EURNZD is no way to goes UP, and these EURNZD SELL trades at least will not get me hurt with big loss.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
It's better if you use template provided by Varum, posted within this topic. It keep this thread more cleaner and more easy to understand for everyone.

I do not set any SL and TP. When I found signal, I enter market. When I found signal (Trend reveal, maybe pulback, or news coming,...), I get out. Or like today, I am very busy due to particular family, too much trades opened. And when I get back to desk, Free margin is low. I decided to close all, at profit 50% . I am not a professional trader. BTW, I suggest you do not trade from mobile app. I used it just to check where/how my trades go to only .

--- 帖子 #222 ---
50% of your overall account? Or in what respective to ?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
You can see at my TE.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Impressive man thats the return you have just from trades since last month right ? Atleast thats what your TE shows. I am more of a conservative type trader with exposure less hence return less with average return of 10% or less every month I suppose.

Hello, Thanks all for sharing your knowledge, it is very helpful to me. I only had one question left for you to be answered guys: What are the exact settings that you guys use on your normal Stochastics, and on your Colored Stochastics (No Label, the one from the other thread, cause on default it's 10,3,3 LWMA, is this correct/ the one that the people here use?). Thanks in advance, greetz TheJube!

NZDCAD

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hovedguy It looks like on both the EUR/CAD and NZD/CAD 4h charts the stoch is below 30. According to the rules that is when you should be looking to buy not sell, but since both are trending down I would wait for a possible reversal. Also on the NZD/CAD 1h chart the 200 ma is below the other two ma's. The rules say to avoid a sell in that situation. Just my observation.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
hello hovedguy , you can show also stochastic in h1? thank you

Apologizes for the open trades on the chart. But just in a breakout strategy for this pair. But am I correct in saying i would be looking for a buy trade here? Or is the MA200 on the H1 way to high for the price to cross it?

so you agree with Duc's sell on EURNZD with no 4H stoch OB and no 1Hr Ma cross? Im very confuse now. Varun's rule is 4H stoch must cross the OB/OS zone then go to 1H and enter only 5 pips below the candle that closed all the Mas. Tell me if I missed soemthing.

Yeah, the lows on your chart were pretty close, not showing a clear trend which may suggest ranging, so stay out until clearer picture

--- 帖子 #252 ---
On H4 chart, as you can see below, stoch is OB. Price is making another LH (I believe it should move a bit higher to qualify as a swing high), so H4 chart satisfies Varun's rules. All you need to do is switch to H1, wait for price to break 34 and 55 MAs. Since the last LL, there was no sell signal. Only sell setup is forming. Hope this helps. ps. I'm not using zigzag to draw swings, just manually. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Dont be confused, follow the rules. Duc's was wrong 200%. It was reckles trade in any matter.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Just to clarify the rules..Trade is still valid if buy setup is in place with H4 stoch below 30 but when H1 closes above for trigger, the H4 has moved above stoch 30...such as AUD/NZD today? Thanks so much

--- 帖子 #258 ---
The main dissent between us is about we get signal (SELL or BUY) on which chart. H4/H1 or H1/M30 EURNZD current in down trend, you can see on Daily TF. So that, I protest for BUY signal, look at SELL only. =&gt; When I found any SELL signal, based on TF H4/H1 or H1/M30, I will enter the market with SELL order. You can check back with signal based on H1/M30 yesterday, at 3:30 and 16:30 GMT+2 I said many time, the different is which chart you look at for the signal! If you only look at H4 for OB-SELL and OS-BUY, okay. But you will miss 200 pips from Mar01 to Mar04... Within these pics, from Mar01 to Mar04 -H4 almost in OverSold -And there are many SELL signal in H1

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I think you will both be profitable if you follow a plan in any case ☺

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Some days can be slow waiting for a perfect setup on H4. This is the system as presented by V so we don't have to stress by chart-watching all day long. There is no reason why the method cannot be applied to lower timeframes if the trend is followed, in my opinion. Pips come in all shapes and sizes! We are all here to learn and try to help each other ☺

Everything I said, based on my knowledge, based on my faults. If you have enough patience, read through my posts within this thread. I already explained clearly. If not, I and you, we are different.

we are talking about Varun's rule. If you have your own rule to enter sell, then i suggest not to mention here because its just cause some confusion specially to those newbies.This is my take according to rule.

Got it, so in normal cases you will wait for the MA to cross right?

Exactly and place your order few pips above

I think you should wait for the retracement on 4H, right ?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
HI Varun, Would you please clarify on the crossing of the MAs ? I understood from Post # 1 we should look for the candles to cross the MAs (up or down) and that the MA trend lines themselves need not cross. By the way, I dipped my toes today GBPAUD sell and EURAUD sell using the V Dynamite method . Trade is still on

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi guys , i wanted to be clear with the rules to start tracking the market setup H4 - stoch below 30 should create LL HL . in H1 tm for BUY , correct? setup H4 - stoch above 70 should create HH LH. in H1 tm for SELL . corect ? i readed the first post about entry, but ... Just for conformation to understand , maybe somebody also didint understandd at first I hope varun brings u lot of green pips guys

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi All... Again. Trying to get my head around this strategy. I like it, just dont think i am getting it. So wanted to run past a possible setup.. NZD/JPY If a new HL is formed now. Good chance it will be with Stoc being over sold. Am I correct in saying we should look to enter on the H1 when bar crosses the SMA's? Or have i miss read the chart?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
A+ ☺

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thanks. I kind of missed it. But I figured I still got time to sneak in. Lets see how that works out.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Yes good set up, but it is counter trend to the daily, I will only look for short on NJ, just my way.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Still on the EURAUD. About 40 pips down. I have a feeling the Mario Draghi talk on Thursday is stirring things up a bit. I am going to stay off all EUR crosses this week.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I am totally in agreement. However I will want to direct your attention to the broken down trend line. Currently it is acting as a support. Let me know what you think. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Good possibility that it will bounce off the trend line, thus creating a HL. But Like I said. only watching as a possible setup.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Who knows when trends change? Just trade what you see, as long as stops are tight, you'll catch the waves☺

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yes I can see your point, worth watching, I run a channel indicator, applied to daily only, it is only picking up the last two swings on the daily.

dear Friends, i am writing this in the midst of my big struggles. Few days ago, i asked Varun for advice with my situation, as he had almost similar situation when he was in big trouble with his financial situation two years ago, but he was able to manage situation by finding the success of his trades and be able to pay off his debt. Varun is a kind person, he tries to help others. And i must appreciate him for his intention and spirit. He suggested me to sell my last thing and put into trading and he would help me by trading my account. I had the same thinking, so later on i put my thing to get a loan of 70 usd with 25 % of interest rate for one month. So i had that 70 usd in my mt4, and i gave him my mt4 account to be traded by him, and i also considered that i would be nervous in my trade decision of the last 70 usd, so it was a good idea to be handled by someone who has good track record in his trading. But unfortunately, Varun made mistakes and the account was blown empty. I have warned him the way he traded, but he insisted on what he was doing was right. Anyway, he calmed me down by saying to me that he would give me 100 usd. But until now, i have not received the money that i desperately need to survive. i feel something has happened to him because he does not answer me on his skype, i hope that he is fine and safe. thank you Friends.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Guy, I have no money, even $70 for you. But I still want to help you. STAY AWAY FROM FOREX! Get a loan to trade forex is a really stupid actions. Find a job to fit your personal, freelancer is a good start. They're your truly friends.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Taking a loan to start trading is like committing a financial suicide and on top of that having such a small account size makes it easier for you to have your account blown away. The best thing to do as said by Ducdaovn is to stay away from forex cause you are involved emotionally in the market. I would also suggest to stay away from forex use it only as a secondary source of income if your account size is less than 10K, these are the advice's are not mine I came across them in best trading books ever written. Regards Brook

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Is it April 1st already ???

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Oh boy Well, if he is that kind person, he will. You can do it again!!!, but if you need so desperately usd 70 to live, I think 800 or 900 is a huge amount of money to blow 4 times!, get 10 bucks somewhere and start again but this time if your account grows in such way take off your winnings. Good luck buddy

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I rather use this forum to share knowledge about forex and trade setups. Call me a cynic but I think anybody asking for money over internet is not real. And I am being diplomatic here since Varun's name is involved. There are a number of things in that "appeal" that makes me raise my eye brows. Not to mention the "10 - 800$" bait. One advice Mr. Gold. Be responsible for your own money. I rather trade and win / lose my own money rather than allow some other guy this pleasure / pain.

--- 帖子 #376 ---

AND... I did not see that coming. Important lesson for this trade was that due to good MM I only lost 0.5% Mentally very easy to deal with knowing that I only need 1 good trade to get back between 1% - 1.5%.

I had it for about 100 pips as well as short Usd/Cad also 100 pip Awesome system btw Shoutout to Varun!!!!!! Quick question though ... If Varun or anyone else can answer why in Varun's TE did he take the opposite of these trades????? Varuns Te link: USD/CAD http://www.forexfactory.com/varun76#...cket.801137690 AUD/JPY http://www.forexfactory.com/varun76#...cket.801134267

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I noticed and will be observing how this support is treated before proceeding.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I am still on USDCAD with stoploss moved to capture 100+ pips. Trade is still on.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I guess I was the lucky one leaving my pending order right where the setup occurred massive move. This trade is more like a gap up in the market so a correction may follow in by the end of the day so I have kept my stop loss at 3% profit level hopefully I am wrong an correction does not occur then it may result in a massive profit. Be careful guys.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I always thought daily time frame does not get affected to that extent with the news release but this proved that belief wrong need to be more careful in future. Although I haven't seen significant changes like these in other major FX pairs on daily time-frame or 4-hourly has anyone else? My experience in trading is relatively less.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
In original thread V said his TE wouldn't be following the system rules. It's play money he is experimenting with. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post8783081 According to the rules, I think: U/CAD should've been a SELL at beginning of his order close bar. A/J should've been a BUY 18 hours after his order open bar. Both would've gone to profit

--- 帖子 #395 ---
There are 3 more critical news release today for the EUR and USD pairs as the news release will be ECB press conference and Minimum Bid rate affecting GBP and EUR pairs. USD unemployment claims. So guys you might wanna secure some of the profits or update the stop losses before the release. I am not trading those pairs today at all as I do not have much experience trading fundamentally. So at the least I will be noting down the behavior of market before and after the news release. Regards Brook

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Is it just me or is this strategy getting crushed this week?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
We better avoid tier#1 news releases (rate decision, NFP, Feb/ECB conference,..). For the other mid/minor news, they hardly can revert the daily chart based direction I think.... We have ECB conference today by the way. I am flat to EUR pairs today.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Yes im in AUDJPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURNZD, i leave the trade in breakeven because two major news this night for NZD and this afternoon for EURO, don't take a EURO trade today ! I think it is important to look at the economic calendar of the week before entering if you use H4 and H1.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Got in too. There are certain level's I am careful about here they are below in the pic. As happened in EURNZD few days back the market bounced back from the daily support level even though the setup for the trade was perfect.

A good presentation easier to read , which does not require changing timeframe: Go to H1 timeframe, set the ZigZag to H4, Stochastic to H4, and the mvas to H1, it's more easier to read the dynamite setup, look:

It certainly was and i was stopped out. Moving on to the next one. Seems like Varuns method is indeed a dynamite. However i will say that the D chart should not be ignored.

Good Call AUD is tumbling down massively I was wondering why the AUDJPY was affected by the ECB news got any incites, I thought it only affects the EUR currency?

I use Marketscope of my broker FXCM, i not use Metatrader4, but it's possible if you find a multi timeframe stochastic and zigzag indicator.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Because EUR increase so stock index (SP500, US30...) fall and when the stock fall the JPY increase and AUD is falling so AUDJPY fall... All is correlated. When ECB or FED speak its all the market who trembles. (Sorry for my bad english).

The ONLY person to be blamed here is, YOU. Once you give out the money whether to a broker or a person you trust to trade, the money is GONE at that moment you hit the transfer button. So come to real sense, get back, find some jobs or anything that pays, LEARN FX and START TRADING FOR YOURSELF. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #420 ---
How the market sentiment changes from one moment to the next. EUR did initially fall. But as soon as Draghi spoke, the mood changed and EUR started scrambling up. I am glad to say that I am out of the market now and will be back next week when things start to stabilize. May be make some pips during retracement and consolidation.

Looks like this thread is coming to an end

--- 帖子 #424 ---
The EUR stated falling after the release of the minimum bid rate which was less than the forecast you can see that on ff yesterdays calendar. Right after this release there was ECB press conference due and Daraghi was about to release further data, he said he did not anticipate the need to reduce the rates further, but added that new facts could change the situation. This dampened "risk-on" sentiment and the euro climbed higher after initially falling. You follow the recent updates on : http://www.forexlive.com/

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Rules the same follow the trend, HH - HL

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Well since the time I posted it is up by at least 40 pips. I had a limit order which did not filled by a few pips.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
This is a good setup. I think the D chart showed it was in a downtrend as well. If the D chart is in sync with the H4 in terms of trend, then it results in a high probability trend.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hey - i was of the understanding that this would not be valid setup as the H4 showed a higher low (the price spike) and therefore this would not fulfill the criteria ? I assumed the pullback which needs to be overbought in this scenario would need to be part of the overall downtrend (LH,LL)

--- 帖子 #438 ---
If you check the D1 chart out is still in a downtrend. I think it is retracing well and cut through the MAs. Nonetheless i will give it a rest this week and come back on Monday.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
BINGOOOOOOO foxtrader!!! d1...THE KEY...the trend is your friend!!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Yes, sometime we have to look to D1 also.. I use H4 as signal chart and H1 as execution chart. There was a time where I take long on GU (H4 and H1 confirm, but I did not check D1), but after few hours I check on D1, there's now way on D1 my TP will hit, since the trend on D1 is down. So I close with a little bit loss.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Too bad since this is a simple strategy, but still need something to filter false signal.. I think some of us made some profit here. CMIIW

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Benz there is no need to give up. I use the D1 as a filter and the rest should follow as per the Dynamite strategy. D1 gives you the big picture always.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Exactily, d1 is the trend... Example... D-h4-h1----silver

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I think you said it need filter but is alright just need to know how to manage your trades

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks Fox, I dont give up, just say its bad a good strategy thread is dead and sink on FF. I am a noob and still learning forex and I think this strategy is profitable. Only need some indis or other TF or whatever that can filter false signal. Varun never post again ? What happen..

--- 帖子 #446 ---
As so many pictures uploaded to this thread, I think (again) the strategy is working. I need to look at something that I dont know yet, to avoid those some false signal. I asked Varun about this and also other ppl ask about video tutorial, he said will tell us later and will create video too. How to manage my trade ? Dont ask me that TW, I am just a noob who still learning forex since 2010 or before.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
hello varun 76, why not write more 'we need your advice, you did the video tutorial?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
why r u saying that?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Varun is probably gone. Seems his account was blown out to zero... and Ducdaovn too. They are good in this from the beginning.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
They must have done something on their own, sticking to the system won't cause that much of drawdown.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Agree with that. With normal money management (let's say he risked 2% per trade) his SL would be hit and there would be no problem to his account. Personally i think he just withdrew it/didn't put a SL on his last couple of trades (for some reason only he knows). But overall, he doesn't have to tell us anything, he is not obliged to tell us anything. Be thankfull for the knowledge he shared, it's a gift

--- 帖子 #452 ---
look forward to hearing from him

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I think Varun has done us all a favour by sharing this strategy and starting this thread. We are all smart people here who can help each other and continue to move forward till he is comfortable in joining us. Think we do not need to be baby sat right ? There are SL and TP strategy involved and that has been discussed as well. Speaking for myself I will continue this as long as it feels logical which it does. Let us continue sharing setups and helping each other here. United we stand divided we fall.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
EURNZD Daily shows it is caught in a range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) H4 shows it has reached a support. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am going to observe what happens. Not going to guess what may happen. But if it bounces off 1.65 it can go all the way up to resistance 1.7190

--- 帖子 #456 ---
n the I agree that we should not be critical of Varun as he has been very generous to share this strategy with us. However, there is something a bit odd about blowing up an account that is in the public domain. We all try out new ideas in demo and they usually fail, that's what a private demo account is for, right? It seems strange to promote a strategy, generously give it out to the world and then blow the account that is on public display to prove the virtue of that strategy. As far as I could tell, all the trades last week broke Varun's own rules for entering and this would be confusing for anyone who had come to the forum to learn the strategy and then cross reference what they had learned with his live trades. I don't doubt the provenance of the strategy or of Varun's integrity which adds to the overall strangeness of this situation.

AUDUSD D1 shows the trend is now moving up. Attached Image (click to enlarge) H4 -- missed the OS yesterday. Waiting for the next wave of retracement. Did some of us get this already ? Attached Image (click to enlarge) H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #459 ---
On H1, do we open sell when 20EMA cross down or waiting the stoch to crossing down the 70 ? because 20EMA is above 50EMA. I always thinking that if 20EMA above 50EMA, then the price is still going up..

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I think we are using 34SMA, 55SMA, and 200 EMA (?). And if i understand it correctly, the position of the MA's relatively to eachother doesn't matter in case of the 2 faster MA's. So resuming: If 34 and 55 are above 200 trend is up, and vice versa. If 34 is between 55 and 200, price is just making a pullback and trend is still up (if 200EMA is the lowest one of course).

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I agree Jube. However I would stick to price making HH &amp; HL to determine if the trend is moving high or vice versa for a trend down. Also position of 200MA is what I hold important as do most traders. Hence that is a line that usually becomes a support or resistance. KISS --- Keep it Simple

--- 帖子 #462 ---
the only problem with this strategy is its lagging. By the time price breaks the EMAs as per the rules, price already went far and most of the time it will reverse soon unless there is a momentum to continue. Again it works so much trending situation but not in ranging situation just like any other strategy.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
This strategy dies as OP's account died

--- 帖子 #464 ---
In my opinion, you don't necessarily have to approach this as a 'strategy'. Rather, I consider this as a general knowledge. The key is how to effectively identify HH/HL swing point at 4H TF and then get the confirmation at 1H. I also think I even don't need to stick to his MAs. Try your own edge as a confirmation at 1H. I don't find anything wrong with his strategy or idea regardless of his trading performance....

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Sure 100% of the indicators are lagging and most positive trades are best achieved when there is a definite trend. I do not see there being anything wrong with it. Anyway. I am going to go on. Tbh I do not have time for negative thoughts.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I agree. Do share if you find any MA that works better. I would have liked to understand from Varun the rationale behind his MA settings.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Sorry, my bad.. Yes, we only use 34SMA, 55SMA and 200EMA..

--- 帖子 #468 ---

you're wrong absolutely friend, I try to help no more blind who do not want to see Goodbye and good luck

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Varun, pls explain how to avoid those some false signals.. thanks

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Thanks for the goodbye, but here i am again. No i just wanted to ask why you asked why we use a 34SMA. Because that is the same kind of question like: "Why don't you use a 35-36-37SMA". We use a 34SMA because we use a 34SMA. And the purpose of that MA is to identify the MA breakout/price action. Hope your question is answered, relax and peace

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I see that you are not using the Stocs to get a buy sell confirmation as per V's strategy. I thought that provided additional trade direction confirmation. Entry is made based on the H1 and EMA's.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
One reason why he might have gone bust is because of the money management that he described: 1st Week - 0.01 Lot for every $200 2nd week - 0.01 Lot for every $100 3rd week - 0.02 Lot for every $100 4th week - 0.03 Lot for every $100 ​I think that is extremely aggressive. The most I would go is 0.01 for every $300 for a small acount (0 - $1000). more than that I would tone down with the risk as the account grows. Greed will ALWAYS destroy your acc.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Yes, he is not using V system.. He just show us (specially me), how important looking at higher TF...

--- 帖子 #480 ---
While V is gone, I want to ask something. How you guys manage the time for trading with system like this? Until last week, I am busy with my job, so I only have limited time to look at the chart. Sometime it is late to enter on H1.. This week start to have time, I am looking at the chart all the time and waiting signal or setup is very boring.. Is it because we are waiting signal in H4, we only need to look at the chart every 4 hours? Sorry for this embarrasing question.. I just dont want to jump to another system or strategy, that take me back to noob habit as I did couple years a go. (collecting indis, strategy, but no result at all..) Benz

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Although I don't exactly use this system, I do trade 4H/1H combination. I made a profile which contains small &amp; simple 15 4H chart windows. Whenever new 4H bar creates I turn on the PC and watch the profile. If I find potential signal at 4H (in this system, potential swing point), I start monitoring its 1H chart each hour until I finally open a position. Once I open a position, I monitor it continuously until I close it. (I mostly complete my trade within 3 4H bars, average trading period is 10 hours). Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
thebenz the stoch is not necessary for me (but you can use it) rebound (ma 10-20) in the upper tf tells me if this oversold overbought in the trend tf lower ratifies the entrance ... p&gt; or &lt;sma50, ema200 sometimes I get buy-sell stop i use w-d-h4 or d-h4-h1.... more trendlines, graphic lines, sop-res.... from your mobile phone could easily manage your tickets, you only use three MA's and bb I will do so soon

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Sound interesting, so if a signal pop up in 1 or 2 charts then switch it to H1.. Maybe I am trapped in the screenshots here that always in 2 chart H4 and H1 for same curr pair.. Wait, if you usually close the position in 3 4H bar, I think you're scalping on H4, right ? Anyway, thanks Heispark.. Benz

--- 帖子 #484 ---
You may say so. I use Heiken Ashi candle and it usually continues its color for 1-8 bars. 1st or 2nd bar is best entry. 3d bar is too late. I take early momentum and get out.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Thank you very much Porfirio, make me clear about how important to look at higher TF. let me know if you created a thread about it..

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Only based on HA ?

hi stony... for me w1-(d1-h4)

--- 帖子 #495 ---
"Porfirio roundup": You use 3 other MA's than the original poster. You use boilinger bands that V didn't use. You look at W1, D1 and H4, instead of original H4/H1. And you don't use stochastics. So thank you for your help of course, but in my opinion it's time for you to start your own thread

--- 帖子 #496 ---
hi porfirio, yes the trend is down, you trade in demo only ? or its for test this strategy ? i don't like demo, demo does not reflect the psychology, psychology/money management is 70% of trading.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
that rude! I'm getting bored I will not waste another minute of my time here in Goodbye

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Adios, gracias por la ayuda

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Indeed. I am at BE too

--- 帖子 #500 ---
That was not smart. Porfirio is providing you setups which you can easily map to the Dynamite system. Way I see it, you have a long way to go in understanding this whole thing. Do not be a burro and try to get the knowledge when someone is giving it to you.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I think Jube is naive and has a lot to know and understand. Do not take his words seriously. We are appreciative of the inputs you are providing. Trend does not change irrespective of the strategy you use. May be the swing point or entries may vary. Any how let's continue this.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Your technique is effective. I got 23 pips yesterday following your set up. I entered again as EG is still going up. Pls continue contributing to this thread. Many are learning from you.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
So been demoing this strat and it seems effective as well as making sense in regards to basically trend following/retracement trades involving MTF My issues are that im having problems capturing the potential pips and stop losses eg money mgmt Most my trades are in the right direction but acct isnt growing due to me either being too greedy or too scared Two things usually happen; either 1- I get stopped out and the trade goes/would've in my direction(sometimes reenter multiple times and lose only for it to go into profit arhhh ) 2-i keep waiting for more pips lol my hand drawn targets maybe are too big? noticed that they are about 100-140 pips and my SL are about 40-70 Another thing that im working on is jumping the gun and getting in too early before all MA support/res is broken Any tips or stats that have been working for you guys ? eg Avg TARGET / Avg SL Currently up 50 pips on SHort NZD/CAD just dont know if i should hold 1hr stoch is crossing down from about 60 but the 4hr stoch is crosing up from 20 Been kinda stalled outsince close of NY session hopefully makes another wave DOWN

After looking back at Varuns first post its seems most his SL were 150-250 and Targets 200-300ish

Hi, i will share you a simple script for Fx Dynamite, run it when the new 4 hours candle open. It detects when the 4 hours stochastic move under 70 AND the 4hours candle is below the 200 moving average OR when the 4 hours stochastic move above 30 AND the 4 hours candle is above the 200 moving average, it is just a little part of Fx Dynamite setup. I have coded it for detect the new opportunity. It scans the pairs where are in your market watch, it is a stupid script, make your own analyse after. Copy/paste the script in your mt4 scripts directorie.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
It can retest swing high (W.pivot) then turn down again. Daily/4H bearish as well. I am watching sell entry... Be careful GDT Price Index release is scheduled. EIDT: New Zealand dairy auction GDT price index -2.9% vs 1.4% prior

Awesome trade setup and massive move on GBPJPY 117 pips on profit. 126+ NOW and counting!!!

Nice brook, but in H4 we can see a up trend (HH and HL)

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Ya that is true but i am good at reacting and reversing my position once it hits my stop loss so there is nothing wrong with just tweaking it a bit now is there..

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I was also following the GY, and on D1 it has reached a resistance so the tendency is to go down, although it formed HH, HL on H4...

Hi. I am Monitoring the following potential set ups: EUR / AUD - Short H4 / H1 EUR / CAD - Short H4 / H1

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Post pictures with your posts. I was waiting as well for the setting to complete. The candle has not crossed the MAs. You should be patient my friend. I also use Heiken Matrix as I saw Varun use it in some of his trades. Well H1 candles have turned blue meaning that the direction has changed to up.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Massive trade Brook. I went in late to feed on the crumbs. 160.00 is probably is a nice psychological level for a short term support. It was truly a Dynamite eh ?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Both these trends seem to have gone sideways. Keep us posted if things change.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Good lad made some profit ya great...definitely 159.0 is the level where reverse happened on H4 so that was the first target and it did hit but it seems the market might get into retracement for a while. I only managed to catch it cause of the V's strategy although signal was for buy I got in for sell at my stop loss I guess was not a bad choice haha..!!!

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Thanks Samphire was a good day today planning for tomorrow now will keep posted if something interesting comes across

Price is moving closer to the major levels on AUDNZD and we can definitely catch the major move with V's strategy on this within few days. Hence it is one of the important pair to keep a close eye on.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Looks pretty much overbought I think..... EDIT: AUD in particular experienced strong moves and if tonight’s employment report fails to impress the currency could fail again at 76 cents. We also have RBA Edey speaking and he may take the opportunity to talk down AUD/USD, which soared from a low near 69 cents to a high near 76 cents in 2 months. http://www.bkassetmanagement.com/fea...ng-lower_9290/

--- 帖子 #534 ---
If you look at the monthly chart for this pair it has made an inverse head and shoulder pattern. It might be one to buy on a long term outlook if it breaches the neck line.

Hi HOVEDGUY and ALL, Since your post above I have been figuring out how improve our radar.

Yesterday's close rejected this level probably due to aftereffects of not releasing FOMC yesterday as there is no need of that. Will wait for todays close to get in for the short. Though need to be aware of the weekend approaching.

Great to hear back from you Varun. Welcome back ! I wish you a rapid recovery buddy. There will always a few disruptive elements who will hover around with negativity and nothing solid to contribute.

Yeah setup is broken, i didn't entered in that trade. Varun, can you describe you daily routine as a trader, e.g how do you make your watchlist, do you use a trading journal? Maybe something speceal and secret? Additional techniques? Analisys on higher timeframes, how you do it.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
yes I do use some advance stuff to figure out hot pairs and best entries which once I thought of sharing here but after all controversies I am not comfortable to share it with every one, after all it was not so easy to figure out such things, after starting this thread some odd people have changed my thinking to a certain bit making me think twice before I do/share something.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I clearly understand and respect your position.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi Varun First of all I want to thank you for everything you're doing. Unfortunately and nowadays, altruism isn't common. That's just how it goes.... I'm reading your thread since you started it. First the previous and now this. I've even done backtesting and I've begun to practice your strategy in demo, and I'm adapting pretty well to it. But now I want to talk about what you've written: In every social group (family, work, friendship and forums like this) there are destructive individuals. From my point of view, and I mean my perspective on life in general, such individuals are, in fact, weak in all respects. But, of course, they are destructive to individuals weaker than themselves. They are losers by nature and do not support other's progress. Much less that others surpass them. I am not a weak person, and I just follow strong people because I always wanna grow as a person and, within this forum, I also wanna grow as a trader. And to grow you must focus on building and move away from all the destructive things. I'm a 47 year old woman and I have lost a lot of my lifetime paying attention to destructive people, people who actually were much weaker than me and later I realized this. And a few years ago I decided to simply ignore them. They don't deserve my time because it is the most valuable thing I have; MY TIME IS MY LIFE. And I have a question for you. Sorry for the bluntness but I like to be very clear and I only see two possible paths: Will you follow these weak individuals and allow them to drag you to their destruction, or on the other hand, ignore them? Tell me honestly, please, if you'll continue with this to 100% or not, because I do and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person in this thread who wants to follow your strategy 100%. Of course, I will respect any decision you make, but if I have to stop following your strategy, I hope you understand I wanna do it as soon as possible. And I'm wasting too much time with this, because they do not deserve a single second. I also want to apologize for my English. It's not my mother tongue and I don't speak it fluently. Thanks for everything. Yolanda (tronner) P.D: Sadly, I have watched most of the threads in this forum are disappearing for the same reason.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Fully agree

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hey Yolanda, Really Impressed by your words, but Its not that I have concluded its because of you people I login to FF, talking about altruism, I always tried my best to help the community but saying is different and when it actually happens to you the state of mind is different which let you down for what you do. As a trader you can well understand how difficult it is to figure out something which works like miracle, but again one criticism is enough to make you realize its not worth sharing what you have discovered in the past with sleepless nights and restless hours however you don't worry I don't want to be the limelight here in this forum, I don't care about the idiotic criticism of few people and I'm keeping an eye on people like you with whom I can share my million dollar strategy and I mean it. Forex is no rocket science and I'm proud that I have discovered something like a grail no matter how unreal it may sound and I feel happy to share it with people who deserve MY TIME and KNOWLEDGE, and not with all. To understand it better feel being in my place. I am preparing a detailed E-book type thing and will be shooting PM's to people like you. stay updated. God Bless.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi Varun I have been following your thread since the start and would like to agree with what Tronner has to say. I have learned much from you, but haven't made any posts as I am still learning and haven't been able to add anything extra to what has already been said. I hope things continue and go from strength to strength. best wishes Martin

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi Varun. Again I have to thank you, on this occasion by your words. I'll be quick. Glad to know that FX Dynamite will continue forward and you'll be ahead. And again I thank you. I'll wait patiently your publications and those of other colleagues (as long as they are constructive), and I'll follow your advice. And when I've learned enough and I'm prepared I hope to contribute with anything of value to this thread, of course, always with your approval. I understand what you say. In Spain it is said: "It's different to see the bull from the barrier than to be in the square fighting it" But the best, in any field, are also those who have gone ahead and saved the obstacles that show up. And it's curious that in all the obstacles, there is almost always people involved. Thanks again and God bless you too. Yolanda (tronner)

Yolanda, you seem to be a very genuine person so let me give you some advice. I have been around these boards a long time, the information our friend is about to send you, you will eventually have to pay for it. Been there, got the teashirt. And your English is very good by the way.

Varun76, Just Do It!!! and I wish you every success in every project you start

--- 帖子 #599 ---
guro, this is going to sound really cliche, but I don't think you know varun. Dig up his history/background... where he came from, who he learned from. And you'll understand why he's doing this, not to make moneys off people. He has a really good heart and I wish you could see that. Call me idiot if you wish. Apologies if I misread your undertone,

Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Hello Varun I'm a young person, a student, who is searching for a way to get in the trading world. Because I'm fairly new to trading I decided that it would be best to start of with learning from other traders. You seem like a great and friendly person, so I think it would be great if I could learn from your ideas. That's why I want to thank you for the efforts you are putting in this thread and for the help you are offering to everyone who has questions. I'll be studying the system and ideas you and fellow traders have provided in this thread and will try to test it out. Again, thank you, and other helpful traders, for the provided information and ideas. Greetings Herat

This morning possible setups.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I'll follow your set ups. I think these are high probability......

--- 帖子 #605 ---
There a only possible setups. Please pay a close attention to a lower timeframe confirmation.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Here's my probable setups:

--- 帖子 #607 ---
In my terminal those setups are look different, but it's because of 4 hour candle starttime is not same.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
[quote=Tenax;8838063]This morning possible setups. Thanks for sharing these, looking good There might be quite low volatility today due to Bank Holiday in most of Europe.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
maybe Tenax, by the time I could not find any good setups, carrying on previous trades, I'll post if I find any good setup keeping an eye specially on uj to short (maybe)

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Like goldmine XAUUSD : I don't trade gold but if I had to trade, I would definitely look to go long on this pair.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
This setup for UJ appears on my chart. Probability is it will go down meeting resistance (MA200) on D1.....

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Thank you for pointing to UJ. I think start understand how you filter some of your trades.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Anyway here's one indi I use which is alone enough to give you reversal hint. and keep you out of bad ones enjoy, and It repaints but good one if used in a creative way

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Thank you. With that indie i can see some of trade context more clearly.

Dear Varun, Varun Thanks a lot for sharing all the good indicators, systems and posting trades. I have been following you for couple of weeks now and have found lot of information suitable and have gained over 100s of pips. I would like to understand more how to use the time frames to open the positive trades along with the indicators, as I have been trying for couple of months not getting the timing right.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I went to the thread and found many indicators. May I know which one to download?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Try xSuperTrend.mq4 first, then try others one-by-one.

Made this trade today, just want to check if I use the system correctly Date: 29/03/2016 Time: 14:37 (CEST) Pair: AUD/USD Action: Long Reason: 1) H4 Sto crossover, forming HL @ 00:00 (CEST) 2) H1 5 pips above MA 34, MA 55, MA200 @14:30 (CEST) Outcome: pending

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Right Guro, I asked her $10000 SHE PAID TO MY PAYPAL ACCOUNT, you can get it for 50% discount

--- 帖子 #621 ---
According to the system the correct entry is after break of all MA'S but this is decent entry if you have a bigger picture in mind

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I am not selfish to share what I have learned after all passing information is our major responsibility, its been a while I am doing this but only have changed the way to do it I will PM to you too soon and won't even ask to purchase a teashirt keep my words friend.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Ow, wait, does it need to be above the MA's on the 4H chart to? Cause I waited until a bar crossed the three MA's on the 1H chart + 5pips. Or did I overlook something? Thanks for commenting on my trade, I want to learn a lot about trading and I really appreciate it when valued members give their opinion.

Guys i want warn you about shorting USDCAD. There Huge hidden divergence on weekly timeframe. So if anyone want to short USDCAD, keep your targets very tight.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi Varun76. Thanks for the awesome thread! I have been reading for a couple of days now, but i still cant figure out how you exit! also, what do you use the stoch for? it seems faster than all the other entry criteria! if you have made that pdf with all the rules, i would love to have a look! God Bless!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I have kept my eyes on it, not time yet

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Thanks, definitely will do

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi Varun, Thanks for sharing your intuitive and simple method. I am relatively new (about 2 years) to forex trading (have done longer term stocks investments but not so much trading in stocks for 4 years) and like your method. Obviously i have a lot to learn and practice but i am trying this with full dedication. If there is something else i can do to help getting better at it, please do let me know. See u around Heather

Thanks varun. Yes 2 years new because #1. Most people says you need more than 10000 hours of experience so i am no where close. #2. it was not full time 2 years. more like started 2 years ago but traded/watched market only few hours a day and sometimes few hours a week.

Hi there Varun The blue box on the chart you use to show resistance. do you put that on manually or is it generated automatically by some indicator. Thanks in advance

Hello VARUN, Understood - Thanks!

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Manually JampelD

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I show here what I did with FxDynamite strategy by Varun. After a lot of mixed opinions, I just want to say that you should learn about it more carefully. I also closed all trades to give you an overview (And I am sure it can continue have more profit if I let them go). 13 days age return 96.1% (Included swap and commissions) MaxDD 10.8% (Ultra low DD) Win rate 80.1% If you want to looking through my trades, take a look at my signature. P/S: I've just BUY 0.01 XAUUSD, just to keep my TE alive with FF (I afraid account will be delete if no activities in period time).

I was sharing it with someone thought to share it here also, long time no update. What I call a great trade is when you get great setups and entries at same time on different pairs, you can use oanda correlation heatmap, its cool one to determine the correlated pairs and look for opposite trades on such pairs, if both gives you a hint about reversaltake it, apologies for punctuation, not mobile friendly I am

Well I sat down and read the thread through till the end. (albeit fast so maybe I missed something) I've seen a lot of charts posted but can't say I found any by Varun (despite repeated references that he would in the "coming week") showing an active setup of his strategy...very strange thread.

Here's a high probability trade for USDCAD. Bias is to go up about 60 to 80 pips before it will plunge down to go with the D1 trend.

Hi Varum, thank you for sharing your trading method, I have read your thread but as I understand it the GBPAUD is in a short downtrend in the H4 / H1 format. No candles have broken all of the ma's, therefore there is no long trade or are you using H1 / M15?. Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #723 ---

GBPAUD is a counter trend, friend. AUDCHF was a good trade

--- 帖子 #730 ---
I rarely trade counter anymore, trading witH trend is enough to lock some good profit anyway If you are curious here are few definite things before taking any counter trend, 1st is must which is price must touch any weekly resistance or support, MA mostly 34, 55, 200 in Higher TF act as one of S/R and ofcource divergence but patience and you'll counter more than enough trade to make good profit every month, trading mostly in the favour of trend my mantra is simple, don't be greedy and keep it simple and no matter what you trade, you HAVE TO BELIEVE in your TRADE, YOUR SYSTEM, YOU'RE SET RULE, AND YOUR GUT. IT IS POSSIBLE.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
GBPAUD looks good but not be wise for me to enter because the price is bellowing weekly pivot also trend has broken to the downside, those kind of trades should be avoided for the time being, on the other hand, AUDCAD is still intact https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post10701787 and also added a long with EURNZD , Weekly looks good along with H&amp;S on D tf and on 1 hr price broke tl. EURCAD took a long as well because price above weekly pivot stock oversold and price in favor of trend. Happy Pipping. V

Hey Varun, glad you're back. Is the MACD still on your recent template? And if there are more changes could you tell us? Thanks in advance, Greetz, TheJube

--- 帖子 #744 ---
everything is still the same, just my views on market, based on this system have changed. I believe forex trading is simple, its just the matter of time it takes to get acquainted with the price behavior. over the time I have realized that to profit from this market you have to keep few things in mind. 1. trade in the favor of the trend 2. there should be no barriers in the direction of the trade which means there should be no MA'S on the higher tf also keep a check on monthly levels. 3. before you execute a trade it must have the most obvious tp at least 50 pips above or bellow. trust me weekly levels is all you need, find the formula to calculate it either you can have an indi or just put some line i do it every week. 4. don't let temptation beat you, if you keep it simple and obvious you will profit. 5. don't believe in people who give you a rough idea, to be honest, they themselves are not sure how could you be? 6. don't make it complicated, no one I repeat no one has an exact formula for this market but I would be lying if I say history does not repeat itself just keep it simple. just pay attention you will know if the market is planing for reversal or pullback, when a reversal is about to happen the price just breaks the 34 and 55 sma at a go if it does not start looking for div. and immediate levels to give you an example look at the gu chart, many people are in favor of a short I was too and I took a short as well but I closed when the market did not break the 55 sma and right at that point there was weekly level to favor a long trade also if you look on weekly the barrier (200 sma) has not been touched and tHere is no div on daily just connect the dots you will find it hard to believe how simple trading could be .. Cheers V

--- 帖子 #745 ---
the previous short, know when to exit.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hey Varun, i do not understand why you took that short, price was still above the ma's.....that you would go long i undrrstand.....do you still look at h1 tf if price breaks throug all ma's?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Is this a valid entry? price returned from weekly pivot, and waited for conformation from HA candle....

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Yes patje, price is above weekly pivot and I am particularly very positive towards usd pairs

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I had also almost the same setup with eur/usd, now allready + 40 pips....how about the tp and sl... Thanks Varun for you help...

--- 帖子 #750 ---
preferred tp and sl is weekly levels if you don't mind what your stats with forex so far?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
I am struggling so far...i started like you discriped, like gambling and than see what it does, after that i wanted to get to know why it went how it did. So i begun to read and read. I learn everyday, sometimes i think i can't do it but i still continue and find out i learned something, It Is my goal to succeed and i will go on, fall and get up again. So i don't have great stats , i blew 2 small live accounts, and after that i said to my self, that i have to become profitable on demo for a longer time, and it is getting better.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I would suggest trading live, take the best trade and forget about it most of the time it does hit my tp, it is a tricky game of patience I guess.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
My goal is to go live in march again. So i have a month to improve a litlle, if you dont mind i will post my next trades on your thread and maybe if you want you can comment them.

Sure thing, patje

The news kicked me out ....

--- 帖子 #756 ---
WHICH PAIR, I guess the market always gives you clue and time to see think and decide don't hurry don't lose look at the gu example. I did nothing more for last few year than to read reversals or continuations based on the system principle, it takes time after all and a part of the process embrace and accept whatever comes the way the probability will favor you if you make decisions wisely ... Cheers V

You should have seen this before taking nusd, even i got knocked out with nusd but i closed at the right time I guess (part of trading) accept loses

HI Varun76, Ive read through your beginning posts, understand the strategy in its simple form. I will test demo first to get used to it. Are you still trading with "Alpari"? I live in Canada as well. Looking for a fair broker as I have been away from trading for a while. Thanks for sharing. Cheers! Alxeman.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
yes Alexman I still trade with alpari all I can say is thanks for going throug the thread this is the only system that has worked so far for me whenever i try to experiment with the rules it knocks me down so best it would be to be precise and safe look at the last few trades, I say so because this is in my experience so far.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hey Varun, yes this one kicked me out, thanks for your feedback. what dou you think about g/u it formed a lower high....is it about to reverse

head over to EURGBP weekly, see there is a HH HL formation and a Daily TL is holding the price like a floodgate, once it breaks price is likely to go up and coming to GBPUSD,it looks like a HL formation on daily chart is awaited, so my bias is to go short for the time being. let's make it serious with a collective effort we can change the world but before we have to have peace in our mind and to me it doesn't mean to not acquire thing but to admire them being an admirer and trust me if you are true to your trades anything is possible.

I've tried everything in forex, but trust me this is the only system I trust. you know world i've spent a good amount of time studying the patterns there are few tricks to eliminate bad trades, I hardly see more than 10 min to charts I've customized my tp and sl to give me specific targets and stop loss and yeh! accurate weekly levels as well. V Post Charts, so that I can help or keep trying everybody has a different view, its just this does works for me. Happy Shivratri PS: Anyone from Bangalore?

[quote=Patje;10774593] Do your best, and forget the rest - Tony H The fact is this system does need some more tweaks to be more accurate and precise. Working on it.

Trust thyself, the lord and your system V

--- 帖子 #778 ---
I find EC to be ugly (just my opinion ) That's the beauty of this system, in forex money can be made this system tells you in which direction V NEVER LIMIT YOURSELF, BE GREEDY IN A LIMITLESS WAY BUT YOUR DECISIONS HAS TO BE ALIGN WITH YOUR THOUGHTS AND ACTION ACCORDINGLY.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hi Varun, Are you trading manually or using an EA? NIce work with your strategy!! Happy belated Shivrathri to you. I am Kochi down south in India, currently in Ontario. Sathish

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hey Satish, I trade manually, but I'm also putting an EA for this strategy, it might take few for minutes V

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Yesterday was a good day but I took a hit as well but recovered it somehow, part of trading .. TE on the profile. Nchf might hit tp, I had some exposure so had to close. Lesser the emotion better the profit I learned it the hard way. What your mindset is while trading? Mine is simple "Make Money. period."

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Looking forward to it. What happened to the TE?

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Performance anxiety I guess. HaVE to admit it was a rough month. V

--- 帖子 #784 ---
This week was rough, But I'm done anyway. Hope next week will bring some clear trades to post here till then Happy Weekend . V

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Have a nice weekend Varun. Next week i hope i will have some better luck.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Good Luck brother, For anyone who wants to join a skype group hit me @ vmehra1223, No money I'll pass on trades as and when I trade, for now, I think this little baby wants to go up .....

--- 帖子 #787 ---
GC and GU I smell up guys what do you think?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hey Varun, GU on H1 made a turn but on the H4 i am not sure yet.... don't you think it will hit weekly pivot?

--- 帖子 #789 ---
look at 15 min chart pointed, did't expect a div. though it turned back in favor of our direction..I'm out so had to carry only one .

--- 帖子 #790 ---
In coming days, we might see a rise in price for euraud and usdcad

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Greetings to everyone, Not new to Forex but looking for a strategy that consumes less time, I think i may have found what im looking for.. I have spent the weekend going through the thread, yes i saw the guy asking for money.. I will give it a try next week!

--- 帖子 #792 ---
hi V, see below 4H &amp; 1H GU charts. a little retracement happening now, so ,maybe a chance to get on the long train next week, will have to see if it makes LL or HL. If a HL is made we wait for the candle to close above all MA's on H1 and pull the trigger on long? Am i on the correct track tho?

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hey Alastair, Yes you're right looking at the Index I think its time. wait for either trend breakout or ma breakout also take a note where weekly S/R holds up. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #794 ---
BOUGHT ECAD, EUSD SOLD UCHF And I never asked money on this thread and never will. Period. But remember every pie in this world is not made out of love for children some are made with hard work for customers.. Judge me on that. And for the time being I'm not looking for any incentive in any manner. thanks

--- 帖子 #795 ---
howzit V, these trades were obviously not taken according to the "rules", correct??

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Obviously taken according to the rule .. S ee, I don't run these markets but over the years I've figured out a way to earn some gooood profit out of it. this system is not holy grail it just increases your winning probability, how you use this system is upto you. Aand if you stick with the system you'll find some really good tricks to earn big risking a lot less but again its upto you how you use the information.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
MOST of the time may it be in the trade or in life things happen in a way you never thought of, and when you replace your wild imagination with decent logic and reasoning your life and your trades as well might take a mighty turn for good..

--- 帖子 #798 ---
closed uc and eu, it failed .. favouring opposite direction based on D tf . will update TE soon ..

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Anyone keeping an eye on GU for possible long setup?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
YUP YUP YUP I love such patterns look at 1hr chart closely I bet once this pattern gets into your head it occurs very often and very profitable this is the time where the market will test the patience of your call, My call is positive for eusd gbpusd euraud eurcad negetive (vic..v..) Te at the end of the week, I want to trade smoothly Cheers.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
good day to all, anyone watching for any possible setups?

Hey Guys follow this thread for Live trades, I'll do my best Thanks. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post10843856 Sorry Forgot to add the link

--- 帖子 #725 ---
As I mentioned in my other thread about EURGBP, Now on live account, I entered a small amount in case the price turns and shoot up but it didn't which is good, take a closer look on MA most of the time the first HL yields most of the profit since as of now the price just crossed 55 SMA which means if it has to go up it would anytime soon . this kind of trade gives you confidence over time if you practice you'll know but take my words in few weeks also the GU shows a great sign of bearish move. Lets hope the best. Also take a look at a similar trade on EURAUD. Certainly, EG could take time but it has potential.
