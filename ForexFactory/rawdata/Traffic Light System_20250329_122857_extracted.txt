It's taken me a while to get the nerve to present this method for my fear of ridicue. But nothing ventured, nothing gained. So I formally present the "Traffic Light" daily trending system (or method). I've been trading this method now since the beginning of December with much success. Admittingly I have over-traded, traded with no SL or TP, and not use any sensible money mangement, yet I have made a little over $7400 in profit, starting with $300 (I have attached a spreadsheet with all my trades). Since I have a non-trading job ( I hope to change that one day), and don't have access to my trades during the day, I've been trying to find/develop a method that would allow me to just trade at night. After a year and half of blowing three live accounts, a ForexFactoryFriend (FFF) suggested a scalping system, which I immediately put it on the daily charts. I fooled around, added/subtracted indicators, consulted with my FFF (on a daily basis), finally coming up with what I think is a pretty good method of trading - well it works for me! So let me thank everyone on FF for all their system, methods, ideas, indicators, etc. It's because of all I've read here, and some great help from a friend (you know who you are) that I offer this method for your consideration. T.F - Daily (that's all I use) Platform - MT4 (build 220) Broker - IBFX (not that this method is broker specific, they are just who I use) Pairs - ALL (whatever you are comfortable with) Indicators: HMA Modified RSI Custom Goldminer 2 (i will attach indicators and template in subsequent posting) These are all indicators that visually show the trend, and thats is what this method is all about. I can't really talk about what makes these indicators do what they do, all I can say is together they visually tell you which way the trend is going and when to get in (pretty early in most cases) and when to get out. For Sell Trades: The HMA Modified must be Red, Goldminer2 must be Red, and RSI Modified must be Red or Yellow. For Buy Trades: The HMA Modified must be Green, Goldminer2 must be Green, and RSI Modified must be Green or Yellow. Exits: You exit when either the HMA Modified line changes colors or Goldminer2 changes to the opposite color of the HMA Modified Line. That's it, pretty simple! I have attached a chart that demonstrates how to get in and out of trades. Now I'm sure there will be those that say that my indicators re-paint so this method is useless. I have not found this to be an issue. I usually take trades Sunday night (giving the new daily bar time to settle in). Around Wednesday morning I try to take some profits and be out Wednesday night/Thursday morning. It seems that the market tends to take back towards the end of the week - I'm still researching this. Ok now it's your turn, what do you think.

sounds good haw about alittle more info would like to see what it is about unable to trade all the time either

--- 帖子 #3 ---
More Info Please Thanks !

--- 帖子 #4 ---
OK Mitch you've got my interest peaked. I would be very keen to participate...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
are you going to post indicators and template?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hey mitch, it looks pretty solid. I too, have found the best way to be profitable is trading the longer TF's. I would like to take this set up for a ride and see how it does for me...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
You guys are too fast for me. Here is the template and indicators.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
According to your system, I see 9 trades in that picture. Any particular reason they weren't pointed out? Or am I getting the system wrong?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I just pointed out a few to illustrate how to trade this method. You can see how easy it is to spot the trades. Nice to see you here, this was the method I was asking you about programming an EA. Mitch

--- 帖子 #10 ---
All, I just noticed that Paulus has a system call Traffic Lights. Any suggestions for a new name would be appreciated. Thanks Mitch

--- 帖子 #11 ---
This looks pretty nice. I am primarily an end of day trader as well. Thanks for the info. How are you calculating your s/l?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Damonl, I have tried many scalping systems and they are just not for me - never made any money with them. I currently have a full-time job that doesn't allow me the opportunity to check on trades during the day. I have been search for a good daily systems that didn't require you to make your trades exactly on the new day bar. The key is to find the best time, for your broker, to make your trades to maximize your profits. Stop Loss, this is where I'm going to get clobbered. I don't use any, or at least not yet. My trade decisions are based upon that I am very confident that I am trading in the correct direction of the immediate trade. Mitch

--- 帖子 #13 ---
So then, how did you determine it was time to close the trades that you took for losses on your .xls file. Was it the end of the day type of decison?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Looks pretty good on a 15M TF with just a LAG added.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Mitch, Thanks for sharing the system. Like you, I work full time, which means scalping isn't really an option for me either. The longer I am in this "game", the more convinced I am that the big money is made in the higher time frames, anyway. Plus, it's usually a lot less stressful! I will be eager to try out your method on a demo account and see how it does. You mentioned the method was viable for ALL pairs. Which pairs have you tested this on to date? Scott

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Damonl, What I've been trying to figure out is when to take profit (without letting greed take over). I ususally make my trades Sunday Night and things usually go well till Wednesday. When I let things ride into Thursday or Friday I usually end up giving back some $$ (still quite profitable I must say). So lately I have been taken back some profit before Wednesday (cutting my trades in half) and then letting everything ride till Wednesday night. Depending upon my profits for the week, I either cut my trades in half again or let them ride one more night. Not really a sound process but I'm still experimenting and hope the real traders out on Forex Factory can help steer me straight

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Mitch, I'm a little confused by your reference to making trades on Sunday night. Are you only placing new trades only on Sunday night (and then only if all the signals line up)? Do you not initiate trades at other points during the week even if the signals suggest you should? Scott

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Sorry for the confusion, I start trading Sunday Night and will usually have 6-10 trades going. I will run these trades throughout the week, cutting my loses when I think it's time and running with trades that are going in my favor. I will pick up occational trades during the week when the signal initate trades during the week when the signal are right. I still don't have all the rule down, that's why I put this system up on FF, too learn from all of you. Mtich

--- 帖子 #19 ---
No problem... sounds like a great group project. Let's see what we can come up with. Scott

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Can It Be Used On Lower Time Frames?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
30 M TF also looks quite usable. Cut the LAG out as it was not really that beneficial in this system.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Seems like a great system. I will be trying this one on demo as soon as I can. Great that you chose to share this with us. Thanks. Cheers! Archie

--- 帖子 #23 ---
TCMM, I only trade on the dailies, but my friend has attempted lower time frames. Unfortunately I don't believe he's been that as successful as I have. I'm hoping that he will chime in with his experience and thoughts. Mitch

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Mitch your efforts are aprecciated... but everyone be very careful with this system in the case if you are going to immediately start out trading on the live account... GoldMinner indicator is reason of my hesitation... monitor 1m chart and you will see why.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Got a question. Do you have the mq4 file for the goldminer 2? Thanks. D.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I know what you mean, the goldminer is repainting bigtime. D.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Mitch, Thanks for posting this system. I think it has great potential and I can't wait to hear the comments of other traders. I've been using a variation of this system for a month. I'm on an fxdd demo - build 220. I did limited testing on the 1 hour and 4 hour charts. I didn't find them to be as profitable as the Daily chart. My approach is different from Mitch's. But his approach is far more profitable than mine. I should note that because I work at home I have more flexibility in placing and monitoring trades. Because I like to limit risk here is how I've decided to trade this system: 1. Sunday night: Wait for the Daily candle. Take a look at each chart and evaluate the signals. Decide which trades to take. 2. Place trades between 4:15 cst and 5:00 cst 3. Use a trade manager to place a basket TP--- currently using $300. 4. Wait (the hard part lol) Most traders suggest not trading Sunday but it's been a good day with this system. I also am not currently using a SL but there are EAs and trade management systems out there that will let you place a SL for the basket of trades. My goal is to get some profit ...even if it's not the $300..... before I go to bed each night. I place new trades each day after the daily candle and again place a TP. I think one area for discussion would be how to calculate a TP. One formula I've seen is Lot size * 100 * # of trades. It makes sense that if you trade only 3 pairs that your TP would be different (lower) than if you traded 8 pairs. As far as SL goes I think if you place SLs for each individual trade you'll be less successful. On the Daily chart there's a lot of sub trend movement within the overall trend. So for those who plan to let trades run 24 hours or more, I'd consider using a trade management package to set a basket SL. Individual SLs will probably be taken out. Some things I've learned is to pay attention to include holidays. The Sunday before the MLK holiday was not a good trade day and frankly I forgot Monday was a holiday. Also there are some days where you get great signals and the trades just go in the opposite direction. I can't explain why but these are fewer than the trades that go well. With my approach I haven't paid much attention to news. Most red folder news comes out during the earlier sessions. So by placing orders at the daily candle and closing them during the Asian session, most of the news impact has already been absorbed by the market. All in all I'm very excited about Mitch's system. He took a scalping approach and moved it to the daily chart, refined the indicators and has been very successful. Sandy

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Scott, I am testing all pair on IBFX. I'm about to do some analysis to see which did better than others. I will report my findings. Good Luck Mitch

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I don't have the mq4, sorry. And yes it repaints, but not so much on the daily charts. This is also why I do not start taking trades untill Sunday night when it's had time to settle in. Mitch

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi, I am a little interested in, and confused about, trading times. How long do you wait until you take trades on sunday night? And do you mean the forming of the daily bar according to GMT? Cheers, Archie

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks, Mitch. I will look forward to your analysis. If you have time, could you also post your trades as you take them starting next week? I think that would be helpful to all of us as we try to get a handle on exactly what you're doing. Also, have you been live since December or just on demo? Cheers, Scott

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Archie, I wish I could give you a specific time, but thats not how I trade. Most Sundays I'm not at my computer for the start of trading, so I start as soon as I can get to it (probably around 7 or 8pm CST). I trade IBFX which is at GMT time. I hope that clears some things up. Mitch

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Scott, I will post my trades Sunday Night - not a problem! I have been trading live for about a year now, but only since December with this method. The Excel that I posted is all live trading specifically with this method. Not I got lucky one week when US interest rates were reduced and I was in all the right places (+$3000 that week). I hope you will find the same success I have - it's a pretty easy system to work with. Mitch

--- 帖子 #34 ---
MitchP Do the indicators change at the day change OR can the indicator change colour through the day depending on how far the day ranges. For example; FXDD changed the day over an hour ago, so looking at the USDCAD the HMA is red and going down . Goldminer, RSI and CCI are all going down but are green , green and going down respectively. If CAD dropped significantly , would the colours of the indicators change through the day OR would they only change the next day? Stephan

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks for sharing Mitch! There is one indicator missing as I got an error message in Experts tab. The missing indicator is THV Sonic Slope, which is available in thread about THV system. Thanks again Mitch!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks for the system Mitch! Attached is a Non Repainting HMA. I have not tested it so someone please let us know how it works!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
One thing that I like to incorporate into daily trading is the Average True Range (14). I use that value as my s/l when i open the trade and then I adjust it along the way using the closes of the bars that follow, or adjust it if the ATR decreases in value, based upon the last close in the case of we had a close higher then the previous close in a short trade.. As long as i can move the stop tighter I do it. I think that you will find you will stay in trades much longer just using this simple formula. Hope it helps......

--- 帖子 #38 ---
The ATR on the USD/CHF is showing as 0.0147 at this moment. Do you mean that you would use a stop on this particular pair of 147?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Stephan, That's a very good question, I'm not sure I can answer that. I have a full time job that doesn't allow me to view my trades during the day, so I only look at my trades in the morning and night. I can tell you that I have placed some trades in the morning and at night the indicators have changes. What I can't tell you is if they can change numerous times during the day. Overall I believe if you are trading the daily charts you won't see too much movement until a new bar appears or there is a drastic change in price. Mitch

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Sounds very interesting, Damon. I put the ATR (14) on one of my charts. It gives values between, say, .015 and .025. If you don't mind, how does this translate to a stop loss value? Scott

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Valasindo, Sorry about that, I am an indicator nut, always trying new ones to get a tighter signal. The THV Sonic Slope was one I was playing with and forgot to delete it. It's not bad, it gives a good trending indication, I'm just not sure it really adds anything. No matter how many indicators I have experimented with, I alsway come back to the basics - HMA, Goldminer, RSI. As I mentioned before I also keep the Trend Master up. What I found with that is when the arrow appears I will go with it for that day only regardless of any of the other indicators - if I was to guess a percentage, I'd say 80% of the time it is dead on. Mitch

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Damonl, thanks for the suggest, I really like that idea. I will give it a try, since right now I don't have any SL incorporated in this method. Mitch

--- 帖子 #43 ---
All, Thanks for taking a interest in this method. It has proven very successful for me (but remember I admit to taking chances, over-trading, running without SL, and being greedy). The basics are here, it's just need a little refining, a good SL/TP/MM plan. I decided, for no particular reasons, to take profit and close out all my trades. The beginning of the week was a bit scary but it changed around Tuesday and the rest of the week was good. I did have a little set back ($500 lose on equity on Wednesday), but since then I came back to being up $1500 from the start of the week!!!! So my lucky continues and I will wait till Sunday to begin again. I will post my trades on Sunday Night shortly after I make them and will keep everyone up to date throughout the week. I would love for others to do the same whether you are trading live or demo ( make sure you let us know what broler you are using).

--- 帖子 #44 ---
When I first open the trade yes. Then as the trade moves in my favor I use the close of the next bars for facting the ATR. As long as i can get a new value that moves the s/l closer to my price I do it

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hmmmm...I am not sure about that. The values should correspond to the pair. For example, EurUsd shold give you 4 decimal places and UsdJpy should give you 2 decimal places. Not sure where you are getting 3 decimal places.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
LOL. I was just rounding up to three on USDCAD. I now see from your reply to paradoxical how you are using the number. Right now USDCAD is sitting at 1.2554, and the ATR (14) is 0.206. So if you entered short, your stoploss would initially be 1.2760, correct? Now, would you then trail the low price by 206 pips? Or are you only moving the stop closer when the ATR is reduced? Or are you doing both, i.e. trailing the lowest price by the lowest ATR (14) value recorded during the life of the trade? Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi, I'm Mitch ( Hi Mitch), I have a problem! I just re-entered the market - why, I don't know, I just like being in the hunt. Here is what I did. I will let it run overnight and close out (hopefully) in profit int he morning. As I type this my trades are already over $100 profit. I love Forex!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
You can trail it if you want. On the daily chart, there is really no need to do so. It would be fine to just adjust it at the end of the day. Then the next day, use the close of the next bar if it gives you a better value otherwise let it ride.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
How do you use the CCI? It is not on your first post at all, but is on your template.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
If anyone wants to trade these as basket trades and close all orders manually whenever, there's an EA for that. There's an EA to close all orders at a certain equity amount reached, also, and one to close orders if your account drops below a certain level. If anyone wants, I can post them.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Dreamliner, I experiement with indicators all the time - add them, subtract them. I will just lloking at CCI at a filter. It seems to work will in conjuction with RSI. When it goes over the "0" line, the upwards trend is strong, when it faill below go short. I'm really liking it but, I have been down this road before. I usually just go back to the basic indicators - they haven't failed me to much lately. By the way - my trades posted are now up to $200! Let's see how much do I need to earn to quit my job and trade full time!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Para, I love to see these. I seen the one that supposely will close all trades when you account reaches a set amount (positive or minus) but I was a little hesitant to use it because I wasn't sure if it looked at your Equity, balance, or just current trades. Mitch

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Does trendmaster repaint? Which of these indicators repaint?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Goldminer2 does but I have not experienced any issue with it at the Daily level

--- 帖子 #55 ---
How about Trendmaster, as it seems you take it anytime you see it.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Mitch I have been with this thread for a while.Its a brilliant strategy.simple and effective.I too have been searching for something similar as I have a full time job.You know what that is like. Thanks for sharing this system.I m sure we all will fetch in to improve it. This system is really good.I just closed my position for today.Made over ( 319pips on the Eur/usd and 50 pips).Great stuff.I can see that this system plus price action will go well. Nim Borneo Trader

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I opened several trades a few hours ago and just closed all for over 200 PIPS profit. Not bad for an evenings "work". Will do the same tomorrow evening. Don't want to lose my profits while sleeping. Besides, right now it's just play money until I see if this really works.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Will post those EAs tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Well it's bedtime for me and my trades are at $283. This is where I struggle, I can take the profit and sleep like a baby, or let it ride (yes I'm a gambler) and toss and turn hoping that it will be at $500 or $600 by the morning. Is there really a choice! Will update all in the morning. Night

--- 帖子 #60 ---
That is incredible, Mitch. You just entered on the strength of the trends in those pairs or what? Wow. Just be careful with those discretionary trades (the gambling). While you may be on a lucky streak at the moment and able to pull off trades "just because", one of these days it will most surely backfire, especially if you're going at it without a stop loss. You're always better off following your plan or system to the letter. Then and only then will you be able to properly evaluate the soundness of what you are doing and be able to improve it. In any event, I do hope you end up with a pot of gold by morning. Scott

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi, Yes, that cleared it all out. I also entered the market last night. I entered soon after the forming of the daily candle, that's 0 GMT since I'm also on IBFX. When I sat down to watch my trades at 8 GMT, they were up 1000 pips!!! I trade 0.1 lots, so that's $100. Is this just plain luck? You described in your first post that you take trades Sunday night and let them ride until Wednesday. But have you tried the approach of taking trades every night, and letting them run until the morning? Could that be a good approach? Then the trades only run through the Sydney session, and mostly the Asian session, so that would mean avoiding most news in Europe and the US. Or shoudl one hold on to the trades longer? Also, about the starting time, is 0 GMT to soon? Should one wait for the daily candle to really settle in? Perhaps take trades in the morning (GMT), and then let them run throughout the day? Or take trades in the evening and lt them run until the daily candle closes? A lot of questions, and I don't expect answers to all of them. I will try to test most of my strategies soon. I hope you wake up to $500-600 on your account! Cheers Archie

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi all, After watching the CCI(14, close) and Trend Master, I think TM is in sync with CCI crosses the 0 line. So I guess it's safe to take out one of the indicator. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Good morning to all, it's 6:15 CST, and I just closed out these trades I made last night at 11:30. I had hopes that I would see $500-$600 (I'm interested in dollars not pips), but I will just have to be satisfied with $950!!!!! And yes I know I am incredibly lucky and take big chances, but they have been paying off. I know one of these weeks things won't be going my way like they did this week ($2500 profit) but hopefully I will have built up a large enough account to ride that wave. Anyway off to my full-time work, I will try to sneak into FF later to answer any questions. Otherwise I will see everyone later tonight. Have a good trading day!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
The less indicators the better - let's try to keep this simple and profitable for all!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Mitch good morning over there brother.I too made good today.I just closed my positions ( $700 or 320pips ).That is enough for me today.Thanks for the system bro.I have managed to combined this system with some chaos trading strategy.I m sure with good money management this system of yours will work wonders. Mitch, you make my day.You the man. Nim

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Archie I take daily trades and close out when I hit a profit I like. It reduces profit but also reduces risk. Last night I placed my trades on fxdd about 15 minutes after the new candle. The trades went up and down for a few hours and then picked up steam during the Asian session. I closed them out at +$200. With this system I think it's possible to take a conservative approach and bank $200 to $300 a night. Not too shabby. Sandy

--- 帖子 #67 ---
For those that want to use this system to trade a lot of pairs, here's some EAs that will protect you. They are self explanatory and you'll have to play around with them first to make sure you competely understand the settings before using them live. Be careful on the Close All EA. Once you attach it to ANY chart, it will IMMEDIATELY close every trade. Good to use if things are going real bad for you. Not sure to what to make of this system yet, but appears to be a trend following system. So, probably only works when there's strong trends? May be a good reason to use an account equity protection EA if you plan on letting trades run for any period of time untended if you're trading several pairs.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thank you for introducing this system to us mitchp ! I been trading the Tokio session last nigh and got about 300 pips. Very promising system! I appreciate it!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Wow. Congrats, Mitch. Well done.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
yeah gi day there mitchp. I too have started trading daily charts recently. have just come across this thread, so perhaps you &amp; others may be onto something here. I have just been putting an entry each day 20 pips above previous daily high &amp; 20 pips below each daily low, but only on usd/gb. Doesnt work on the others. but with these indicators you have, should make it easier. anyway i`ll keep watching, thanks.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
paradoical bro....Thanks for the EAs man.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
If I'm not mistaken, those EAs only close trades, not open them. So there would be nothing to "backtest." Scott

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks bro.my mistake.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thanks for sharing Mitch I'm a scalper, but its hard to trade like that with day job, and was looking for good daily trade system, this one looks good and simple(hate million indics on my chart), will take a look for sure... Cheers

--- 帖子 #75 ---
These EAs are not EAs to make trades for you based on a particular system. The Close All EA is simply to close out all open trades and orders. This is only needed if you have several trades, and don't want to take the time to close them all manually. You'd slap that EA on any chart, and it would immediately close all of your trades. You'd need this if you were freaking out while watching a your trades go against you rapidly. With that EA, it workd a lot faster than your shaky fingers could. The two other EAs are to protect you from losing too much, and to let you take profit at a certain dollar amount. These would be very good to use with this system when you're out, or asleep. Most likely, people here are going to have anywhere between two and several pairs open at one point in time. Instead od setting a stop on each pair, you can use the EA to stop you out at a $300.00 loss, a $500.00 loss, or whatever you want. I think you'll see when trading many pairs at once some pretty nasty drawdown, and you need to be prepared for that. Depending on your account size, you can have the EA close you out, so you can trade another day. If you traded seven pairs, and the market went screwey, I GUARANTEE all of you that you could be down 700 pips easy. I'd really recommend that people be aware of this potentiality, and only use a lot size that wouldn't blow 50% of your account if you were down that 700 pips. It's nice when the pairs are trending and you've made 400 pips. Not so nice when it goes the other way, and before you know it, you're down a thousand pips. This EA is a GLOBAL EA and gets you out of all trades at whatever equity loss you want to use. The other one will allow you to take profit at whatever you want, anbd again, this is a global EA. Whether you have one pair or 10 going, the EA will close them all when in profit by whatever amount you want. These three EAs are a good fit for this system if you plan on having several trades going. Play around with them on demo accounts until you get the feel for how they work.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Another thing to be aware of is if your computer loses connection to the internet or if the broker server goes down these EAs will not protect your account. If the connection is lost the EAs can't function. It's not like setting a hard SL and TP with each pair. Hard SLs and TPs go with the order to the server and remain in effect even if your computer loses connection with the broker system. That being said I use the Hopwood trade manager to set a global TP and SL for all open orders. But currently I watch the trades during the evening and worst case could call my broker if I wanted to kill the trades. Sandy

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Paradoxical, Thanks for the EA's. These will be very helpful and I plan on incorporating some of them immediately. I have the Close All already in my arsenal - it's come in handy before. Mitch

--- 帖子 #78 ---
This traffic light system is also working well on 1H time frame. I also no longer use the Trend Master indicator as CCI 14 close, is far more "powerful" than Trend Master since I can see when the price is going to reverse its direction. To catch this "early wave", enter when CCI is going up/down and breaking the -100/100 line and HMA is green/red, and exit when CCI is haven't touch the 0 line yet but already moving against your trade.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
The trendmaster is the indicator that puts the arrows on the chart? thx, todd

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi, I am not quite sure what the different indicators show. It would be very helpful if someone could give a short explanation of them. RSI shows if the currency pair is overbought/oversold, right? So red means overbought, and green means oversold? The HMA shows the average trend, right? I am not sure about the Goldminer indicator, what does it show? According to the first post trades are not taken with CCI and Trend Master taken into account, why? And what do these two indicators show? Thanks Archie

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Archie. You are correct, The RSI will show Red when it's below 45, Yellow when it's between 45 &amp; 55, and Green when it's about 55. The HMA shows average trend, Red is downward, Green is Upwards. The CCI is just something that I am experimenting with (didn't realize it was on my chart when I made the picture). The Trend Master is not really part of the system but is just something I like to be able to watch (again I should have deleted it before making the picture of the chart). So essentially you wait for the colors to line up (remember RSI Yellow can go either way) and you buy or sell in the appropriate direction. Hope that helps Mitch

Today I flipped over to the H1 charts and using this system I made a little over $150. I'm surprised but happy Sandy

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Sandy, Did you follow valasindo way of trading on the 1-hr (using CCI) or are you doing your own thing. Mitch

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Has anyone back tested this system? Results?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Todd, You are correct, but it is not really part of this system. I had it on my chart when I took the picture, forgot to take it off. Mitch

--- 帖子 #86 ---
jgnorton, Just look at it on any chart, it get you into the trend at a great point and takes you out before you give back too much. I have been trading it live since the beginning of December and it has been fantastic. I started with a $300 account and now it's up to $6500 (admit I over trade - 6-10 pairs a week singlot lot trades on a mini account)

--- 帖子 #87 ---
If the indicators repaint (which I'm sure goldminer does) backtesting is worthless with this system. It will look great in backtest, whereas in live the indicator will repaint.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Trading almost over for the week. I took several pairs last night and closed last night for a couple hundred pips. If I still had them, would be up maybe a hundred pips as a guess. Will demo again Sunday evening sometime. May try two different approaches. One where I use a global stop and global take profit, and the other where I just let them go unless there's a different signal the next trading day.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Mitch, I posted my comment before I saw valasindo's post. For the 1 hour trade I used the ferrufx multi trend indicator and checked to see if goldminer and rsi were in agreement. Then I made sure cci was pointed in the right direction. I use a trend indicator that's similar to the trend arrows you have. I made sure the trade was in the direction of the arrow. Lastly I looked at the candle formation to make sure it was also bullish for a long or bearish for a short. This all takes 5 seconds to check. I do like valasindo's comment about the cci. It looks like the cci breaking through the -100 is a good signal for a trend upturn and vice versa. I'm not quite clear on whether he's exiting as the cci crosses the 0 line or waits longer for a trend change though. I'm going to watch this more next week. Sandy

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I don't well understand which indicators, you posted here, you really follow, and also what exactly are the entry and exit point. Can you better specify? Thanks. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Nubchai, I will close my position when I see that the CCI line is going against the trade while still above or below the 0 line. I just want a safe trade. I will enter again when the CCI is crossing the 0 line.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Just to get a clear on this: To get in on a trade, like it says in the First Post with the Picture, you get in by when its the beginning of another Trend or Reversal and the Signals show, which can take days to come on a Daily Chart, or also you get in on the open of the Single Bar at night, when the Signals are all Lined up again. Is this True, because in the Thread here, it seems that a lot of trades go in at for example, Sunday night For Daily Chart. Can you Explain?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Lubo, No disrespect, but did you read the first post. If this isn't the easiest system to follow, I don't know what is. There are three indicators: HMA, RSI, Goldminer2. The HMA will either be Green or Red, Goldminer2 the same. RSI will either be Red, Green or Yellow. Yellow goes either way, So If HMA is Red, Goldminer2 is Red, and RSI is Red or Yellow - you sell! If HMA is Green, Goldminer2 is Green, and RSI is Green or Yellow - you buy! That's it and if you really want to be conservative on buy or sell when all three indicators are the same color - red or green. That's it, there is no more. Forget about Trend Master, forget about CCI, these are just additional indicators I was playing with and forgot to take off my chart when I posted this system. And if you're wondering if this system works just take a look at the Excel Spreadsheet I posted. It represents all my live trading of this system since Dec. Let me know if you are still confused. Mitch

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I don't like the trendmaster. As far as CCI, it's OK, but isn't the be all and end all of indicators. It's just one of many. What you will find in the coming weeks and months, Mitch, is people adding their own indicators and refinements. That's just the way it goes on FF. People want to tweak things. Add an indy here. Another indy there. Add em all together, and you get a rainbow chart, with one indi contradicting another, and leaving you wondering if the trade is really viable or not. As the thread goes on, all kinds of people will chime in with their "refinements". You watch. One guy will say "Hey, Mitch, I found a triplee zzxx stoch that keeps you out of bad entries". Another guy will say, "Hey, Mitch, I have this quadruple blue diamond indi that does XYZ". This is not to say your system can't be refined and improved. It IS to say there will be many that will be trying to just that. So, get used to it. On occasion, you will get indi's and improvements that are worthwhile. Mostly, though, they just muck up what already works.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Let's see if I can explain this. There is no specific day to start your trading, you take a trade when HMA, RSI, and Goldminer2 indicates a trade can be taken (as described in the first post). I personally start my trading Sunday night, adjusting my trades and taking some profit through Wednesday Night. Depending upon how well things are going, I will determine if I'mgoing to continue trading Thursday and Friday. I do this because in the past these days traditionally tend to be ones that take more than they give. But that's not written in stone, this week I thought I was done Thursday night but trading was going well and I bought in again for a $950 profit overnight. Remember that no system is foolproof, the day you decide to enter a trade might be the end of the trend and you will lose some. But this system will get you out fast and into the next trend pretty early. Hope that helps, just let me know if you still need direction Mitch

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks for your thoughts and I couldn't agree more with you. I like my method just the way it is - it works for me and that is what is most important for me. If someone can add something that makes it better, that would be great. Oh, the one thing that you forgot is the slew of programmers that will decide that an EA is just right and over take this thread. I have been an on looker here at FF for a long time. Everything I have learned is because of this forum and the great people that so freely give their knowledge and ideas. Like a lot of people that post systems, I just wanted to give something back and help people be successful like I have most recently been. Again, I appreciate you involvement and I hope this all can lead to lots of pips for all. Mitch

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Since you mentioned about pips... I just realize that I haven't close yesterday trade! Dang... It's good though, 125 pips profit (GBP/USD), and the indicators are all looking good. Too bad I can't close this trade because my broker is close on Saturday and Sunday. Btw, another way of closing the trade is to use a trailing stop. The question is, how big is the value? I'm thinking of using ATR(14) to determine the value for the trailing stop. Any comments? Ideas?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
What I mean is in the first Post you show the daily chart of when to get in the trade buy or sell and signals all lined up. What I see from this Chart is that you get in on the trade right at the trend reveral which is the right way on a daily chart. but what I want to know is that on a single Bar only, if that new bar starts at night, do you trade on that bar only if the indicators show that. Thats I would like to know. Thanks a lot Mitchp

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "single bar only"

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Mitchp Do you trade on the turn of the trend which is the reversal,, in the middle of the trend, or both?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I guess you can say both. In the past when I said I was going to wait for the trend to change before getting in, the trend wouldn't change and I'd be pissed for not getting in. So now I take the trade whenever it comes and hope I'm either on the front end or middle of the trend. This is not a perfect system, sometimes you hit the end of a trend and your trades go against you. But if you follow the method it will get you out without too much of a loss. Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #102 ---
So to summarize, you get in long or short when you have a reversal in the trend with the indicators all in agreement with each other. But If the trend keeps going and indicators are still in an agreement with each other, I guess you can go in on the open of the next daily candle too?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yes, I agree with your statement

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Thanks Mitch for your reply, yes i have read from the first post, but perhaps I remained confused by the pictures and indicators posted, including the tpl. Now it's clear. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
OK now I have a few things to add that people might like. 1) ATR- you use this for length of Bar. Set it at 5, then when you put your cursor on it, it will tell you how many pips the length will be, by getting the average five Bars back it can give you how many pips it will do. 2) By having done that, now I will explain how to put a stoploss, make your first profit and trail the second profit with a stopless. OK put 2 trades in, for example one trade $1.00, and one trade $1.00. Now you have 2 trades in both at a $1.00 a pip. Get the ATR on the Bar your in on, lets say its 200 pips, so set take profit at 180 pips. When this trade is out the other is still in. Now you put the stoploss three Bars back and let that trade ride. Every time a new Daily Bar opens move your stoploss to the next Bar so its always 3 Bars back until some where it will hit you stop and like this you can get most of the longs trends when they happen. If sometimes the 3 Bars back can be to long for stoploss move stoploss closer, because your on a Daily Chart and the stop can be too far when this happens. The better you trade on Daily the less time on computer and more time for yourself. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thanks Valasindo. I looked at some charts and saw a lot of trades where the cci moved up through -100, through the 0 line and up to the +100 line where it curled and was a good exit. Nice strategy. Even for hourly I would check the other indicators to get a feel for the trend direction. But the cci looks like a good indicator for this type of trading. Sandy

--- 帖子 #107 ---
All, Does anyone know of or have an indicator that would display the day of the week for each bar on the daily chart. Mitch

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Mitch, you have a very nice and easy system here. And true to paradoxical's post I was the first guy to screw it up by posting "something else". The thread should stay pure and simple. I haven't been on FF long but I do agree with the statements that others will come along and want or need to "tweak". I told myself that I would never be one so i will go and delete my post. I have subscribed to your thread and will follow it as well as use your system.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Yes, here you go. All I have is the ex4.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Glad to have you along. Paradoxical is right, just read any thread. But don't be afraid to add your thoughts or any new indicators. I like what we have developed and it's been successful for me, but that doesn't mean it can't be inproved. That's why we put it up on FF, to see how other traders would respond to it, try to improve it, and to hopefully help others be successful.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks BenQ!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi, can somebody tell me if the goldmine repaints within one bar or some bars back? thx

--- 帖子 #113 ---
On the daily chart I don't think it's more than one or two. What I can tell you is so far I've ony had it repaint twice on me that required me to get out of trades. I had lost some pips, but it wasn't too bad and I made them back the same week. Mitch

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Mitch, to make up for my previous post here is the 5 day indicator as an mq4 file in case you want to modify it.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thanks for the indicator!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I did a little test on vHands, I saw tha Goldminer doesn't repaint, but Rsi custom and Hma modified do, its seems for 1 bar. Maybe it's only on vHands. Lubo

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Sorry, also goldminer repaints from 4-5 bar back. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
That's heavy.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Lubo, Wow, I didn't realize that, but the fact is it hasn't hindered me. It may be because I start my trading Sunday Night after the bar has time to settle in and I don't look at it until the next day around the same time. I know at lot of people will try to move this method down to a lower chart for scalping, then maybe the repainting issue becomes an issue. Tomorrow I will post my trades and let all of you follow along. Hopefully you will see that the repainting of the indicators (if they do at all) won't effect your net profitability (by the time you close your trades). Remember my style of trading is to buy on Sunday, adjust and take some profit through Wednesday and then get out entirely by Friday morning. I do not let trades ride over the weekend - Sunday start up is too crazy. God I hope my trades go well, otherwise I will have a lot of ""xplain-en to do Lucy"

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Mitch, What's your approach on trading this system when major news is scheduled for the next day? For example if GBP employment stats are scheduled for a Wednesday do you avoid trading any GBP pairs that day? Thnks, Sandy

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Sandy, To be honest, because of the my noobie mind, I tend to forget about looking for major news. I will always stay away from Non-Farm, but up until now I haven't stayed away from anything else because of news. Mitch

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Mitch. With all respect for what you are trying to do. DamonL has this thread on FF and it is doing an excellent job in indicating when to enter a trade: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=72891 That is his ATP 1 version, and there are a couple of different improvements to that first strategy, called ATP 2 and ATP 3 NOT trying to be a party pooper, but nothing here is new and already tested and proven in Damonl's strategies. It has a bunch of indicators that really fit into trading on a daily basis. This thead got my attention for the name that is a double of Traffic Light of Paulus, who has put together a nice functioning system making use of a version of the CCI. You can save yourself a lot of time in checking out all above and not reinventing the wheel. Keep making the pips, brother !!!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hey, Freddy -- you can say the same for 90% of the threads here at FF (including damonl's and Paulus'). They are all based on prior work. Let the thread develop.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Ben, Thanks for the support. I never said I invented anything, in fact I think I said all I did was find a way to trade the dailies using the best of what I had read about on FF ( if I didn't, then I just did). This method works for me, at least so far, and I thought it might be useful to others. And through the exchange of ideas, it might even get better (again at least for me). So I invite all to explore what I have presented, add to, subtract from, debate, and even argue that it's crap. Hey I'm going over to check out Freddy's suggested thread to see if there's anything I can incorporate into my method to make it better. Mitch

--- 帖子 #125 ---
With all respect, Damonl and especially Paulus, post too many system, that you can not understand what they follow, and I have not seen any of their work so interesting. Always so enthusiastic for their results and then they change method...... Lubo.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Freddy, I checked Damon's thread and the only things it has in common with the traffic Light system is that it trades on the daily chart and follows the primary trend. The indicators and approach are all different. Also Damon seems to have left that thread and started a new one with a different strategy. Since there are other daily systems out there I don't think we should say "Let's not develop a new daily system with a different approach" Just my 2 cents. I like this system because it's simple and so far in my demo testing has been profitable. Sandy

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks Mitch. I avoid NFP too. Sandy

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I post a lot of systems as I see them. Personally I think people rely on one system to get them there and in that I think is a mistake, but that is only my personal feeling. My ATP threads were daily threads that took me many hours each evening to trade and I thought I would do better trading on lower TF's. I ended up spending more time at my puter during the day than I did at the end of the day and make far less pips. That is why I went back to trading dailies. I am still looking for one good intraday system for the H1 or M30 TF's which I am constantly looking at making better what I have now. I am now back to doing a version of ATP and have a thread open in the journal area where I keep track of my results. Since Dec 01, 2008 I have closed more than 35,000 pips and currently am up almost 30,000 pips in open trades. I have seen my open trades reach 500% in profit with very little risk btw because I use Bill Williams theory of adding on more postions as the trades go in my favor. Currently I am up over 300% in profit in open trades. This system is more of a daily scalpling system that takes daily trades for small profits. I try to maximize my profits by taking everything that the makret gives to me. So, I say that this is a good start to a trading system and wish well all who trade it.

Mitch, Thanks for posting your system it looks great and easy to follow, I'll be testing it today on the LFH trading simulator. Anyone that might have a problem with the repaint issue (of any system)should make use of the simulator to practise trading, this has helped me improve my trading quite a bit ... simulation practise then also shows you how very wrong some indicators can be, and misleading .... especially if you looking at history and think WOW.

When you think about it, 40,000+ pips is really not that big of a deal when you're trading 20 currencies over 2 months time. That's an average of 1,000 pips per month, per currency. If you figure there are roughly 20 trading days in a month, that's only about 50 pips per day per currency pair. For me, that's WAY too much work. I would much rather increase my lots and trade just a couple of pairs. So, instread of trading 1 lot on 20 different pairs, I would much rather trade 10 lots on 3 pairs. I primarily trade the GBP pairs as they make nice moves and are generally in sync with each other, meaning that if one goes down, they all go down(for the most part). This past week alone, I picked up over 3,500 pips just trading GBPJPY, GBPUSD, &amp; GBPCHF. This is really not that big of a deal. The hardest thing is to train yourself to stay in the trade. Most people start by trading the 1M, 5M, or even the 15M charts, which is just fine, but when you start to trade the larger timeframes, you need to train yourself to stay in that trade so that you can capitalize on the moves that are happening. I'm not going to post any system, as there are way too many posted as it is and as soon as someone sees that someone has made a lot of pips, they immediately change systems, until the next guy comes along and posts another sytem that generates a lot of pips. One of the major reasons that I think people fail in trading the forex market is that they are constantly changing systems. They are forex system junkies looking to get their next fix. If you just stuck with one system, you would probably be amazed at the results that you could get. Even if it was an MA crossover with one or two other indicators for confirmation. Whatever system you pick, just stick with it. Anyway, that's my 2 pips worth...

I added the word "Daily" to this system so people wouldn't confuse it with other Traffic Light systems. This is not to say that this is exclusive a "Daily" system, it's just the way I trade it. I encourage all to test it at all levels and share their results.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Mitch, I simulated your system today (took about 2 hours) and the results as per attached. I will try to attach the chart as well so you have a better view of the trades. Here are a few observations: 1. 7 Nov – trade closed as HMA changed to green on the open of the next bar…. It redrew to red later. 2. 12 Dec – Goldminer redrew 3 bar back. 3. 22 Dec – Goldminer redrew 2 bars back. 4. 26 Dec – HMA was green on open and no trade taken. 5. 5 Jan – HMA was red on open and no trade taken. 6. 6 Jan – Goldminer redrew 2 bars back 7. 16 Jan – HMA was red on open, no trade taken. 8. 19 Jan – HMA was green on open, no trade taken. The RSI indicator works well and I only saw it redraw once – to yellow. One observation that struck me was the close of a bar – when it closed below the HMA signaled a change in direction for short, and when a bar closed above the HMA it signaled long. As far as I could see, the goldminer is no use at all, but the RSI + CCI together with the close of the bar above/below the HMA gave very good indications of a long or short trade. When I have got time, I will try to simulate it with the close of the bar above/below the HMA. As you will see, the system was profitable for the 3 months and I think it has good potential… Thanks Mitch.

Thanks for the analysis, it sort of confirms what I've suspected about Goldmine (that it repaints more than I thought). But even though it repaints, I don't really think it has hurt me, maybe just kept me out of a trade longer. I think this is because I don't trade on the start of the new daily (that's 4pm for me), I usually get to the charts between 6-8pm CST. By that time the new bar has had time to settle into a direction. I think it's the same for HMA, I'm giving it time to establish itself before I take a trade. I have seen it change on me, but only at the very beginning of a trade, so my lose is usually very low. The bottom line is we want to find the best combination of indicators, without overloading our charts. If goldminer is useless and CCI proves to be a better filter, than we just gave everyone a better tool to make pips with. Lets keep up this kind of exchange - I love it!!!!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Jnita, part of your post said "One observation that struck me was the close of a bar – when it closed below the HMA signaled a change in direction for short, and when a bar closed above the HMA it signaled long." I manually back checked the EUR/USD, and didn't find this to be the case. I found no pattern. If there was that sort of pattern, of even whe3re it was the case 60-80% of the time, that would be a great find as it would be a definite signal to change direction. Am I looking at the same thing?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I'm doing an experiment using only built-in indicators in MT4: RSI(8, open) and CCI(14, open). I'm using 'open' (instead of 'close' or other option) to make these indicators more "stable" and easier for me to decide. The only custom indicator that I'm using is the HMA indi (not the 'modified' version though). Any ideas of using built-in indicator to replace this HMA?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Freddy, I attached that KG Indicator to my chart. I suspect it repaints like the goldminer does. It looks like that 3 Level Semifor that some really like, but which I hate. I personally watched the Level 3 Semifor move a total of SEVENTEEN bars one day on a 15 minute chart. It only stopped moving to the next candle when the pair moved had finally had two up bars. In looking at it on a chart, it looked like the Holy Grail, though. But, I will keep my eye on this. If it only repaints one bar, might not be so bad to use on an hour chart.

Good rule for trading daily is look at 1 hour for setup the same direction and enter and exit on 15 min. Also if your in the trade on a Daily look at 1 hour for retracements if you want to exit, keeping a eye on the 15 min. to. These 3 Chart frames are like Radar for Daily Trading.

Hi, I wonder when you all place your trades? Is 15 minutes after 0 GMT too soon? Does the daily bar get time to settle in just 15 minutes or should I wait longer? Also, perhaps it can be good to wait longer on Sundays since the market is quite slow in the beginning? Cheers, Archie

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Mitch, I am interested in your strategy am going to demo trade it. I also have a job that keeps me from watching the market during the day here in the States. You said that you started with $300 and have built it up. With not using a stop loss and only having $300 in your account, did you ever come close to losing your total account when the market went against you during the day when you couldn't watch it? Thanks

--- 帖子 #156 ---
That KG signal is a repainter, as I thought. You have to be there to watch it. What it does is to appear over or under the candle that just closed before, whether that be a 5 minute, one hour or whatever chart you're using. If that candle had just gone down 50 pips, the arrow appears over it, as if it gave the signal BEFORE the drop, whereas the signal was giving the candle later. Also, if that nexy dandle starts to go up, the arrow disappears, as if it never were there. I know this is all due to the pair movement, and all, but I'd say use it cautiously. What you see on the charts is after a lot of repainting and erasing.

Archie, I normally wait a couple hours on Sunday. Mitch

1522Dad, When I started out, I only had enough money to trade a couple pairs. As my equity/margin grew I was able to expand that upwards. Though I had losers, my win were higher and I was able to reinvest my equity into more pairs. I also must say I got really lucky to be in the correct position when the Feds lowered interest rate (that week my trades shoot up by $3000). Since then I have been averaging about $1000/week. Again, I have been lucky that I have not experienced any great draw-down by not being able to watch my trades. Let me point out that I actually get to look at the trades in the morning and when I get home, till I go to bed (around 11pm-12am). So I do have the morning to readjust anything that has gone bad overnight (though overnight is where I make the most), and the night to correct for the day actions. Hope that answers your question. Mitch

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Mitch I have been looking at the thread and as usual things develop and change over time. What are the current indicators that you are using? Mister ED

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Mitch, Nice trading formula. I've been trading for a few years, but always looking for a new stratagy. I will watch (and maybe use this system this week) on a live mini account. My main question is ... now (Sunday 01:00 GMT) the pound and euro have had a few days of downward spikes and doji's... are you tempted to go long eventhough the traffic light system still shows downward pressure ?? Thanks, mike

--- 帖子 #161 ---
The basics for this system haven't changes: HMA Modified RSI Custom Goodminer2 At least they haven't changes for me!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Thanks for the quick reply. I guess the only way to really test things as regards the potential of the indictor repainting and altering things is to see how it works in forward testing with the indicators as they are. I will try to give my results when I have had a reasonable period over which to test things. All the best and good luck with an interesting thread. Mister ED

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I try not to second guess the signals, if it says sell, I sell! I try not to worry about one specific pair or another, I'm trading a basket of pairs and the net effect is what I'm concern with. So in the beginning I take the trades as they are given, then re-adjust as the week goes along (but still based upon what the system is telling me).

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Mister Ed, Good luck this week, I will be making my trades in just a little bit. I look forward to seeing how you do. Mitch

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks Mitch for the quick reply... plan your trade and trade you plan. Good luck and thanks again for this thread.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Ok, Here are my trades for now. I actually have a couple other pairs I'm interest in but the spreads are way too big right now. I will monitor them and hope they go down: GBPCHF, EURCAD. If you can't see the attached, let me know and I will type them out. Good luck to all of us Mitch

--- 帖子 #167 ---
On your EUR/GBP trade, are you using a SL? if so where are you setting it. Am looking forward to following your thread.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
At this point in my trading, I do not use SL. Risky, yes, but it's worked for me - so you need to do what is best for you. Dont' misunderstand me, I know deep down I should have some protection built into my trades. I just haven't figured out what that should be. And like I said, so far it hasn't hurt me.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thanks for your reply. It is certain that someone following your thread will provide some input on this issue.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Mitch, Could you explain what rules you use when you adjust your trades, 1 - when they are going against you, and 2 - when they are going in you favor ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Currently my trades have all gone against me, but this is the norm for me. Sunday nights I experience my largest draw-down, but by Monday morning I'm usually in positive territory. I'm still waiting for the spreads on those two pairs to get under control and then I'll be set for the night. I have cut back on the number of trades so I could enter with additional lots. The plans is when those trade are in good pipage, I will close one lot, add a break even SL and let those trade fly. See I am thinking about SL, just got to figure out what is right for me. Mitch

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi Guys I know Mitchp went in which is right that the traffic lights Shows the signals, but not to get in right away yet, I am waiting when the Hour time frame lines up with the daily and also looking at the 15min. because there is retracements still. I posted this in Post #149 Thanks Just To Help

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Also keep an eye on news it can turn the trend. Positive news from Obama on push fast to get economy going quicker means Eur/Usd may go up. When bad U.S news Breaks U.S dollar gets stronger. WHY? because when things get better like Positive News. U.S. is the first to get better. Always have www.bloomberg.com Go to Home Page, then Breaking News, this will help to give you idea of whats going. Hope this helps a little. Dailies can be retracing or there can be trend Reversal because of Obama trying to do things quicker which means positive Keep an Eye! Here is what i Mean Obama aide won't rule out more money for bailouts Fed focus turns to credit easing at policy meeting New York City to Get $3.4 Billion U.S. Stimulus, Schumer Said This is Positive News for U.S Which Means Trend Change If you look at the One hour Time Frame EUR/USD the News reacted to this. Now we will see what the dailies do. Here is Negative News for example Euro, Pound Fall on Speculation Economic Woes Will Be Prolonged

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Mitch Since a certain amount of retracement seems to be the norm after daily candle open, have you considered using a retracement limit order to place your trades. Although I trade individual pairs instead of a basket, I often set limit orders instead of market orders. The trade would be activated after it retraced X number of pips. You could use a set number of pips depending on the volatility of the pair. I often use 23% of the body of the previous candle and enter at candle close ( I usually don't trade on Sunday night). The trade will be activated about 90% of the time. You would reduce your risk and drawdown and hit your target quicker. A number of traders that use Paulus' EOD system use different variations of limit orders. It makes the risk/reward ratio more favorable. The only drawback is that a certain % of trades will not be activated because price did not retrace sufficiently. Even if you used 15-20 pips of retracement per pair and you were trading a basket of 8-10 pairs, it would reduce your drawdown significantly.

Thanks for warning. I tested on gbpusd and it was just an observation for the last 3 months. Unfortunately forex is like any other job, forex just has more homework. I will still try to simulate this aspect to see if it carries any weight. Edit: I had another look, and the close above/below the HMA was significant if the open was below the HMA and close above the HMA (up bar) it more than likely signaled a long entry. and visa versa

--- 帖子 #176 ---
The Rule for Daily Trading would be not to trade on Sunday, because of low volatility.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Sorry, if anyone missunderstood me .... I am not here to change any of the rules or indicators. It was only an observation. My trades were done on the open and close of everyday. I did not close any trades until the close of the day. Some trades went over +1000, at least 3 went over +600 ... but because I waited for the close of a bar (change of a signal at close of bar), a lot of pips were given back. Edit:Hope this was more helpful and clear.

Asian Stocks Rise as Shippers Advance on Fees; Contractors Drop Together with Obama Positive News Could Mean why eur/usd is heading up?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi, Mitch. Thanks for posting your trades. Being more conservative, I have only entered two trades: USDCAD (sell) and EURAUD (sell). Some of the trends of the other pairs look a bit tired, so I figured might be best to wait for confirmation or a new signal. Interesting that you entered a sell on EURUSD. On my broker's charts (IBFX), the HMA indicator has turned green. Looking forward to seeing how all this plays out. Good luck this week! Scott

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Update -- now the HMA on EURUSD is back to red again. LOL. I guess I just experienced the HMA's repainting in action! Scott

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Scott, Mine had gone green and I was about to get out but it has turned red so I'm good. Typical Sunday, my buys went south on me, it went down almost to -$600 (remember I'm buy single and double lots). I have to admit, that was one of the bigger draw-downs I've seen. But again like most Sundays, my trades have rebounded and I'm now a positive $63. I'm head off to bed, will update all in the AM Night All Mitch

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Sounds good, Mitch. Plus you just had to know that as soon as you began to share your trades publicly, they would take a little bit of a hit, right? That happens to just about all system sharers on FF. But I'm glad to hear that it sounds like your trades have rebounded. My USDCAD trade is doing well, but the EURAUD trade is dragging me down at the moment. Talk to you tomorrow. Scott

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi, I am watching 11 pairs at the moment, and took trades on 9 of them yesterday night, shortly after the forming of the daily candle. I think the basket turned positive during the night (during the middle of the Asian session), but when I checked at 7 GMT it was negative, and it still is. I am trading the Yen pairs as well and these are always moving a lot. They affect my basket more than the other pairs, and perhaps it would be good to exclude them, if one wants to reduce the risk? Which pairs are you all trading, and which ones are the best to trade in your opinion? I am thinking of excluding the Yen pairs, at least for a while. Cheers, Archie

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hey Mitch, Wasn't that €/Gbp Long a bit risky to take, I mean, pair already went over 500pips up, +my CCi starts to went down Thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Mitch; Thanks for this wonderful system. I love it and use it straight away. But regarding of GBPUSD and EURUSD, these pairs already experienced massive downtrend and in the last three days showed reversal candles. Therefore, although the HMA of these pairs this morning showed red, I placed buy on these pairs. And now, the HMA are green !! Thanks God. And hopefully going north ! I just closed half of my position (chicken !!!) and let the other half open. The other pairs are spot-on. Therefore, I think it is wise to see the candles. It may help further. Anyway, thanks for the system. Really appreciated. BKH

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi, Almost all of my pairs in the basket have chnaged color on the HMA during the morning. Would it perhaps be good to trade lower timeframes? I have looked at 1H, and I'm not sure, but perhaps it doesn't repaint that often?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Wouldn't you know it, I finally put this system up and boast about good its been for me and right away it turns on me. All but one of my trades went south on me, so much, that I had to close everything out this morning. I would have to say that this is was the biggest lose I've experienced! I'm not sure what went wrong, it's been a sure winner up to this point. Oh well, I will keep on trading because I do believe in the system, it just still needs work. Mitch

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Mitch... Great system . Very similar to the one i'm using now and has been very positive for me . My concern is when you placed your buy on the EUR/GBP , (as an example) , last night .Yes the trend has been established for the past week and a half or so . So why enter at a late stage of a trend when all the colors match up ? To risky for me . i'm willing to wait for the proper colors to set up first , then get in , less draw down on the account ...also a pretty good stop loss when first entering a trade for me is a 20-day ATR x (70%). Then adjust , as the trade progress in my favor... It is still a great style of trading . i would be more cautious on when entering , think you would find it more Profitable ... ...... buffalopip.......

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thanks, you are probably right and thats what I hoped to learn from putting this up on FF.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Well I traded live last night for the first time and was very conservative. I was trading .01 pips so money wasn't the goal. I wanted to see how the system worked on the live fxdd server. With these 4 trades I made around $.39 but again I watched them and closed them out before I went to bed. Overall I made +$15 thanks to earlier trades in egbp, gj and gu which I closed. I also scalped a little on ej. I plan to place trades again tonight. I don't want to second guess the system but maybe looking at the length of the existing trend is something to think about. In other words a long downtrend based on the HMA may be losing steam. As opposed to a recent trend reversal. Just a thought. Sandy

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Excellent point, I've always used bars but it may be time to start paying attention to the candlesticks. Nice move with your trades, you called that one correct!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Sandy, Glad to hear you had some positive results. I guess it was just time for the system to take back a bit from me. We've talked in the past about maybe Sunday wasn't a good day to take trades, and those thoughts are still running in my head. I agree about taking a look at the length of the trend, but I was hoping the RSI would give the signal about a possible turn. Mitch

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Mitch, Successful trading on Sunday seems to be a 50-50 proposition. If you wait until the opening trend has passed I've seen this system produce very good results on Sundays. So last night was payback I guess lol. Sandy

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Mitch, as you well know, you can't expect to win every night or every week or even every month in this game. Hang in there. I think the system is pretty sound... just needs some tweaks on when to get in and out efficiently. Personally, I think it would be safer to enter at the beginning of trends (as indicated by the indicators) and ride them until a a stop loss or trailing stop takes you out of the trade and then just wait for a new change of trend to enter again. Trying to guess at how much of a trend is left and enter accordingly is difficult business. My thought (admittedly it is early) would be to take the new signals on whatever day of the week they present themselves and let them ride until the trade takes you out (maybe do a scenario where you take a certain % profit on one lot and let the second lot run until taken out). And I would consider leaving the trades open over the weekend as well. I have seen several people talking about opening trades one night and then closing at the end of the next day. That's really more like scalping the daily time frame as opposed to a true daily method. The beauty of a daily method is taking small hits on the losers but letting the winners run for as many pips as possible -- multiple days or even weeks. Anyway, just a thought. Update: My USDCAD short is doing really well, and my EURAUD is a little in the hole at the moment. But I've got SLs set for both so will just let them ride. Thanks again for the system! Scott

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Trading at the beginning of a trend would be a safe way to go. I prefer to end a trade when I'm at a profit level I'm happy with. But staying with trades 1 or more days may prove more lucrative. It's riskier though in that you increase exposure to news events that may have a big impact on the basket of trades. But taking partial profits and using a basket SL would counteract that. So it's all in your trading style. One thing I like about this system is there's a number of ways you can use it. Sandy

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Good thing for waiting and went long on eur and gpb US and by looking at the lower time frames and news.Post #173 Also be careful on Sunday's for Daily Trading

Hi there. I took it on my own. At least on my IBFX platform, HMA has turned red, Goldminer is red, and RSI has turned yellow. Currently down quite a bit on it, though (about 85 pips). We'll see if she comes back. Scott

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Yes, to all Signals like the Daily, going the same way thats what I did last night waited to see it clear on the One hour then long on Eur/usd And Gbp/Usd it happen at London Open Can be the Dailies Retracement or Trend Change Also looking at news.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
buffalopip....curious about your SL calculations? Currently the 20 day ATR for Usd/Cad is at 0.0222. If I want to short this pair, what would be my SL and how did you calculate it? Thanks in advance for your help!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
ATR should be set at 5 look at my Post#105

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi GRPip ... it would be .0222 x 70% = 155 pip's or 222 x .70 = 155 pip's for the caddy stoploss for the daily trade ... On the 4-hr window , use the 4-hr ATR the same way .... .... its a good way in my past experience to enter a trade this way , (for me ) , it gives it breathing room for price fluxation untill i'm in the green . I only use the Daily or 4-hr window to trade on . Take about 25 to 50 pips on the four window , unless moving strong in my favor , then go for 50 to 100 pips or more . Price movement of course ... On the Daily window i use the ATR for the whole 24-hr period ..... then adjust my stop loss to stay in the green , but to also stay in the trade for a possible long trem trend .... if it closes out , so what , i'm still made my pips , just wait for the next signal .... Hope this helps ..... buffalopip....

As I reported earlier I had a tremendous take back from trades held overnight. This morning I closed out all trades and, still sticking with my system, I re-bought into the market. At end of day, I once again found my trades in the negative. I have been trading this system since the beginning of December and have never had the market go so bad against me. I am now down around $2000 (live dollars). But I still have faith and am learning alot from all of you - especially about the need for SL and the possibilty of not not trading the Sunday bar. I'm currently in a total of 3 trades and things are looking good so far. There are a number trades I'd like to take but they don't follow the rules, so I will wait a bit in hopes things change and the signals are there. I hope those of you testing or even working this system live are doing well and you see a potential for this system. I'd love to know how you all are doing. Mitch

--- 帖子 #212 ---
TCMM Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hello, You have a nice simple system. I have something along the same lines as you. What helps me is the Murrey Math Grid, SMA close 50 and 200 lines. They add great visuals to help see direction. Also knowing candlestick patterns is very helpful too. Invest in the book by stephen bigalow high profit candlestick patterns. This book opened my eyes, very helpful and easy reading. Thanks, Paul

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Paul do you have a template and the murray math grid indicator? I always like looking at different set-ups. Thanks, Sandy

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Thanks for the suggestions, I will look into the candlestick patterns book.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Mitch. My trading day hasn't gone very well either. I'm currently in euraud, eurchf and egbp long. Also gbpchf and usdcad short. I'm using .01 lots (until I'm comfortable with the system)at fxdd and the last I looked was -$7.00. Usually with this system if I can get trades in close to the new candle I see a pop in the price of the basket of pairs and close out at a profit. Not following the true daily strategy but it was working for me. The last two days seem "off" to me. I'll continue to work with the system though. I'm thinking that maybe a multi timeframe confirmation as someone else here mentioned might be something to look at. So if the daily signals say "long" check the 4 hour and 1 hour for confirmation. Sandy

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hello, Basically I use the grid with 50 sma close and 200 sma close. Stoch 12/3/3. OSMA 12/26/9 (color changer). This acts like a early warning. Candlestick patterns knowing them is a biggie. I really deal with the sma, stoch, and where the price sits on the grid. You can search here for info on murrey math grid. Cant find my copy on the computer. Its along the lines of fibonnaci. You can add the hma line or a t3 to help show consolidation. But the more you add more confusing it gets. Like its not hard already. Best advice keep it simple. Like I said that book opened my eyes. You get great input on here and alot of help. That book was suggested to me and I am very glad it was.

Excuse me, but my post was addressed to buffalopip. He has a different approach and I was interested in his explanation/calculations.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Mitch, Sorry about your loss, I'm forward testing [live account] a similar system. Here's how I'm testing: Buy Entry: HMA (8Period) on Day chart Green, Place a Buy Stop order on the previous 4H HIGH Sell Entry: HMA (8Period) on Day chart Red, Place a Sell Stop order on the previous 4H LOW TP: 60% 5 day ATR SL: 100 or Previous 4H HIGH (for SELL order) and Previous 4H LOW (for BUY order) This way it eliminates some entries in the transition, like yesterday. Now I have AUDJPY &amp; USDJPY BUY orders filled for today and all others still pending. HTH Thanks DL

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Mitch, I hope you recover from your loss.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Please keep us update on your method, it's sounds like a great way to go.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks! Currently I'm +$144 so I'm on my way

--- 帖子 #225 ---
DL, Interesting approach. How long have you been trading this system and can you give us an idea of the success rate? Also when you say the "previous 4 Hour high" are you using the 4 hour candle that close at hour 20 as opposed to the 4 hour candle that closed at hour 00? I'm assuming hour 20 but wanted to clarify. Thanks very much, Sandy

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Mitch, I'm also a bit confused.. if Rsi repaints, and Golminer repaints.. then how can you trust your entries?? To me the only indicator that makes sense, not considering CCI, is Trend Master, which at least does not repaint .. ciao Alex

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yes, 4 hour candle that close at hour 20.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Funny you should ask that! In most circumstances I would agree with you, but I've been successful in live trading, well at least up to this morning. Right now, still trading the system, I'm positive $480 - that's a good sign to me. I was told that you need to trade your system and don't be discouraged over a few loses - the proof of the system will be at the end of the week or end of the month or end of the year. I will keep going until, without a shadow of a doubt, the repainting truely is detremental to making money.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Alex, I think you should try the system for yourself and see how you can help make it better.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Did you think about using Fibonacci levels to set your SL? You can use Support/Resistance lines.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Mitch which currencies and long or short are you trading now?

I'd love to tell you but I'm having problems accessing my MT4, for some reason it won't open up. I had this problem once with a MT4 from FDXX, I didn't have access to my trades for a number of hours. I was about to contact FDXX to sell off my trades, when all of a sudden it started working again - luckily I didn't lose any money! As soon as I get access I will post my trades. I know was in USDCAD (sell) that was doing well. Mitch

Yes, I went long E/U last night as well. Interestingly, when I entered the trade, there was a Trendmaster up arrow on today's bar. When I got up this morning and price has retraced, the arrow is now gone. So whoever said Trendmaster doesn't repaint is wrong. I am down about 56 pips at the moment. So we'll see what happens. So far with this system (or maybe my version of it, I should say): EUR/AUD SHORT -229 pips (closed - hit stoploss) USD/CAD SHORT +103 (open) EUR/USD LONG -56 (open) Total: -182 pips Scott

Base on Mitch's Rule you may be in too early because Goldminer is not Green.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yep, I took it based on the HMA, RSI and Trendmaster indicator (which has now reappeared again on my charts, LOL). But I acknowledged in my message that this was "my version" of Mitch's system. I am on demo, so just trying different things at the moment. Looks like E/U may be trying to go back north again now. Scott

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I think we just looking @ a possible retrace and will go south before to long.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes, it might me only retrace...was almost sure that trend will change and go up, but it didn't. We will know more at next bar I think I guess Trendmaster is based on 2 crossing ma's, and if every tick function, arrows might show when they cross, and if they went apart again, arrow will gone

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Trendmaster repaints as well, 1 bar. Lubo.

So last night before I went to bed my trades were are $150. For some reason I woke up at 2:00am and decide to check thing s out. I was thrilled to see my trades at near $800, I thought ok, this is more like it. I went back to bed with pips dancing in my head, only to wake up and find my trades at $100. Ok, still positive, all I need is a good US session, but 10 hours later I found myself at -$100. I just don't know what to think! I should probably give it up for the week and start over on Sunday. How is every one else doing? Have you all given up on my system? Mitch

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Oh no. I have entered short on the USD/CAN. So let see. Why didn't you take some profit when you were making $800? Or move your stop to lock in some profit.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
1) I was half asleep 2) I'm a fool 3) Greed is greatest at 2:30am 4) I don't learn from my mistakes should I go on.... I am short on USDCAN, so good luck to both of us. Mitch

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Mitch: I just saw your thread few days back and was impresssed about your results. Tried on demo day before yesterday and unfortunately that day was a bad day for me. I still want to try this system. No system can be profitable all the time. We have to figure out money management. I liked the simplicity of the system. Also, it fits my schedule as I can sit on my computer only in the evening. I will enter in the evening and close in the night before I go to bed unless I figure out a reasonable SL/TP. With live account, I can go without TP but definitely not without SL. Good luck and don't give up. How long you are trading this system? Thanks -FX_California

I have spent the last 8 month trying to come up with a daily system. It was in Nov that a friend sent me a scalping system. Something just went off in my head and a few days later I had this method. I started to trade it live in December. Are in in CA., I'm originally from LA (Valley). Mitch

--- 帖子 #254 ---
mitch, hang in there. The money isn't going anywhere. Sometimes it's best to take a breather and collect your thoughts after some losses. I haven't traded live for weeks after some bad trades. I spend probably 10 hours a day, seven days a week studying forex. I'll never know everything. Most people on FF know lots more than I do. That's why I come here. Because most are better than I am, and I pick up new things every day. When winning, go more. When losing, go less, or stay out. The trend is your friend, as the old saying goes, until it ends. WEhen it's getting tired, and so are you, time to get out for awhile. BTW, I live in Valencia.

Hey Mitch, When you were 800+, you really should'n let things go negative. You know this is forex and anything is possible. I was really pissed of every time good trade becomes a looser! Now I use EA for managing my trades and helpes me a lot. When I scalp, a set it break-even at +8 pips, so I really need 8pips in my way to have no loss, my exits are usually at fib levels. In this daily trading, break-even should mabey be set at 70pips or 100, need some tests ofcourse. You can trail also...So check it and mabey play with it a little, mabey you will find it usefull. It sets also TP and SL. Here you go

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Gas, Thanks for the help, this is something I could use. I will experiment and let you know how it goes. Mitch

--- 帖子 #260 ---
The confusing thing about this system is that it really did work for over a month and the signals were correct. Then it hits a patch where the signals are off and there doesn't seem to be major news that threw things off. So what is it that makes the signals periodically unstable? Also I think if you trade this system live it makes a lot of sense to use a trade manager EA. Set a SL at -$300 or whatever you think is reasonable. I'm also a fan of locking in partial profits.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Sandy, I agree with you, but I've seen this system go negative $600 and then turn the other way and go positive $1200. So determining that SL and TP have been is the issue. After this week, I think I just have to pick a level and live with it. Mitch

--- 帖子 #262 ---
True. If you have a high risk tolerance you could set a basket SL at -$1000. The other factor is the number of trades. More pairs and especially volatile pairs sometimes leads to more drawdown. The other factor is when to take a reasonable profit.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi, Any system will give wins and losses. Our job is to keep the losses as small as possible. Try not to risk more than your profit. Always have a stop loss. Lock in profits that way you dont loose it on a drawdown. Greed is bad, discipline is good in this market. Candlesticks tell a big story. No lagtime, they deal with the price movement. Indicators help with the story, they dont tell the whole story. Use together will help you achieve your goals. Thanks for reading, Paul

Try to put Pivot levels on your chart and use them as SL/TP levels. For some reasons these levels work strong enough in FOREX in comparison with stocks...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Thanks Pmah, I will put them up and give them a try! I'm also look at incorporating CCI back ( yes it was part of the original idea)in the mex. I have customized an indicator to how CCI as bars just like RSI, so it works well in the overall concept. Don't know if it will add anything yet, but time will tell. Today has been a nothing day for me, my trades have goine nowhere. Mitch

--- 帖子 #267 ---
You got greedy...Also, you need to use daily, weekly and monthly pivots which will let you see support and resistant..

You are correct, and hopefully I can learn from these costly mistakes.

Has anyone forward tested this strategy on smaller timeframes, like 30m or 1 hour ? Any bad experiences with the repainting issue of goldminer ? (On backtesting it sure looks great !)

--- 帖子 #270 ---
As goldminer repaints one bar or more backwards, maybe it would help to just make it a bit more sensitive, changing settings from 7 down to 5. Might this be a solution for smaller timeframes ? (And maybe higher ones too)

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I get more buy/sell alerts on the 15 min chart.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Tonight I decided to focus on the major pairs + EJ. I looked at the HMA on the H1, H4 and Daily charts to find agreement. I also looked at other indicators to confirm the signals. I was going to short EJ and EU and long UCHF. But I goofed and entered 2 separate sell orders for EJ and 1 buy order for UCHF. I used a trade manager and set it to +$400. If the trades hit that the trade manager would close the 3 trades. I made the $400 (demo) in less than an hour. And contrary to my normal bad habits I'm not going to place more trades I think multi timeframe confirmation of signals (as others have suggested) will help weed out bad trades. Sandy

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Also what I have observed is that taking the signals that goes with the trend is far more successful.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
And have you had any success with the goldminer when forward testing ? If so, at what setting do you use the goldminer ? Seems to me, at 7, signals might come in too late.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I think it is a wonderful idea Sandy! Lets try it and see if the confirmation on 3 time frames will help us to weed out wrong or unstable trades!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I have been live trading the system and only entering trades when all the indicators are in line and only at the change of the day . So differently from you (I can do this as I run my own business from home and can be at the computer when I like) I have been using a 150 trailing stop (TS) and over the past week entered USDCAD, GBPCHF and EURGBP (still in this trade). All cases a profit. The profit could have been greater in CAD and CHF but the TS was not large enough on these 2 and for only a small profit. I don't think TS is the way. GBP is +210 pips so far. So I am working on another method. Enter the trade aand at the next day change bring the stop to breakeven then exit when the indicators (CCI crosses 0 and HMA changes colour............still deciding on the stop size) Also the 150 pips stop is too big to make serious money because of my MM rules. However, I do want to point out that the Goldminer does repaint a couple of days and the RSI a day on all the trades. So effectively, I could have been in the trade earlier. What doesn't seem to repaint, on a day by day basis, is the CCI and HMA. They certainly change intraday but as yet I haven't seen them repaint the next day. So I am only going to use those indicators to enter and exit when the HMA changes colour. Anyway, great system and thanks

--- 帖子 #277 ---
When I am able to login into by demo account I post some details of my trades. But so far so good. I have taken all the trading signals except the GBP. CAN, EUR/JPY and AUD all failed but I think I went into the trade too early and paid the price. Thats expected since new to the indicators. Currently, I am in the EUR (110 pips), AUD (120 pips) and EUR/GBP (300 pips). The system definately works but it requires patience. Wait for the bar/candle to close on the day with all 3 indicators lined up, then enter for the new day. Also I wait for both the Goldminer and RSI to have the same colour (back testing confirms this). I know Mitch said yellow can work as well, but back testing shows more success with the same colour. Since I am only trading from the daily chart, I will only be going with the trend. What I have used for stops are daily harmonics (average daily move) for each of the currency pairs. AUD is 100-120 pips, GBP is 200-250 pips, EUR 120-150 pips etc. Next week I will be incorporating some Fibs for further confirmaton. I will post my result next Friday this time. Mitch this is an excellent system you have here and with everyone pitching in can only make it better.... Peace...

--- 帖子 #278 ---
mitch please let us know the trades u take on sunday so we can follow along and learn the system

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Great to have you on board. I'm aware of goldminers repainting issues but haven't figure out how to use it effectively. It may not be necessary at all, so your technique may prove successful. Keep us updated on your progression. Mitch

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Nice trades so far, hope you keep it up. Remember that the Goldminer re-paints so what you may be seeing is not necessary the same in live forward trading. Right now I'm trying to figure out how best to use Goldminer - I really like it but if it repaints a couple days it may not be as good as I thought. Mitch

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I have not fiddled with the settings. I have them on the 15 min, hr and daily charts.. See what happens next week.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I notice the repainting. That's why I am planning to incorporate Fibs to increase the percentage in my favour.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Starting next week I will forward test this strategy on smaller timeframes. I will use a goldminer setting of 5 and see if the repainting issue gives late entries. Below the goldminer5 is a goldminer setting of 3 to see if this setting will be more appropriate.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
This is the best version so far, simple, effective and above all no repaint. Repaiting is disastrous

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Howard, I made 500 pips[live] last week following the method. From this week I'm planning to have a Trailing Stop as some of the trades went almost 100 pips positive and hit my SL. I will have 150 TS for GBPCHF &amp; GBPUSD and for all others 100. I don't trade GBPJPY. Thanks DL

Hello All, Well I'm hoping for a better week and one that will show how nice of a method this is. Below find my trades for the start of the week. I hope you all have great lucky this week and go Steelers (made a bet in September that they would go all the way). Mitch

I went with: Sell: chfjpy, eurgbp, ej, eu Buy: gu, gchf, usdchf There's early morning red folder gbp news so I could be in trouble. But it's on demo. We'll see how it goes. Sandy

Will Trade, Not bad, I hope it keeps up! I'm hovering just under $200 and have confidence that these will do well over night. I;ll review everything in about an hour to see if I need to made any adjustments. Mitch

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Might not be a bad trade. The H1 and H4 HMA turned red along with another indicator I use on the daily. GBP news is coming out at 2 am and 4:30 am. Since it's a demo I'll keep the long and see how it reacts to the news. If I were trading this live I wouldn't have traded the GBP at all.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Please bear with me on this question. But being new to MT4, I'm not sure which folders I should be downloading indicators. So far, I have been putting the .ex4 and .mq4 downloads in the indicator folder. Is this correct? also does anyone have a pivot point indicator that works well? Thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Morning update: My trades are currently -$850. Anything with GBP is down and all the others are up. Since it's a demo I'll let them run. Sandy

--- 帖子 #295 ---
slc right... this system uses indicators and no expert assistants (eas). So all of the indicators go into the indicators folder. Then you drag each indicator to the chart for the pairs you want to work with. What I do is set up one chart. Then I save the template and load the template to all of the other pairs I'm using. Much faster. Sandy

--- 帖子 #296 ---
This is exactly what I did. I was making over 220 pips off the USD/CAN and I let it reverse. I got out according to the rules of the mitch's system. This was my first trade using the system. If it was live I would have taken some profit out and break even with the reminding lots.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hello mitchp, I have been following your tread from last week, looks profitable. Thank you for sharing. Yesterday I saw you took the trades in EURCAD and EURAUD (yellow lines),but am confused because in both were not signals, according with rules. The signals were given in green lines. I am correct? Thank you Best regards sorry for my poor English

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I'm glad you like the method! The reason I bought where I did was because I was out of the market last Friday, so Sunday was the first day I could take trades. There is nothing wrong with your entries, also remember different brokers will present different trade opportunities. Good luck with your trades. Mitch

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Mitch In post #287 in that chart where did you get the CCI indicator in the bar colour. Can you Post it to down load. Thanks Can Any body post this CCI Indicator Bar Colour so I can put it in my Charts Please. Thats on the Chart in Post #287 from Mitch"s Chart.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
After forward testing the goldminer indicator - I came to the conclusion that it is completely useless on lower timeframes. See attached screenshot. Where the red arrow is - this is where the first blue bar on goldminer appeared. On the next bar opening - the area I marked with vertical lines(6bars) - all the 6 red bars changed to blue. So this indi can not be used when backtesting at all and does not perform well when forward testing. Giving late entries. I will forward test HMA together with the RSI indicator. If both agree - I will enter a trade. See how that goes.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
this is not designed to be traded in lower time frames.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
so what's the final word on goldminer? After the day has closed, will it repaint? Is that even a bad thing in peoples experience? I've looked at it a bit. I'm thinking I'll do 80% of previous days 14atr as an initial stop, and perhaps a cross of a CCI and an MA of that CCI or perhaps some sort of trailing stop... Looking forward to testing this out. Peace Stuart

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Mitchp, Thanks for sharing this wonderful system, i have been watching it work on live data and it works. Ofcourse there is some more things that can be done to improve this system. We could add Bill Williams Fractals to the system which can be used as a stoploss in any time frame. Also there could be a good stoploss indicator added to this system. Lets go on make it work better

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I've been demo'ing this system on the 5M timeframe with some re-painting but it hasn't affected profitability. I only trade during recommended hours and on GBD/USD and EUR/USD. I always use a stop loss which washes me out of a few trades but being profitable in the long run is what matters. I do not enter signals that are generated by single bar large move.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
The HMA modified just repaited on me. Yesterday at candle close on daily chart It was GREEN EURO/jpy. Today , its red. If these things repaint, how can we trust them? I thought goldminer was the only one that repaints.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I'm having all kinds of issue with things this week. I'm at the point where I'm re-evaluating all the indicators and how they work with each others. I know we're on what can be a wicked trading week, but the system has failed me now for over 10 trading days. As soon as I can figure this out I will be back with my findings and any revised trading method. In the meantime, please, everyone keep posting your comments, win's, loses, etc, so we can all learn. Thanks Mitch

Hello here I have a question about goldminer2 indicator. Does anybody have an idea how it actually works? What does it show or what does it count? Thanks in advance Cheers

--- 帖子 #309 ---
some programmer in here should take these indicators and make them to where: once the candle has closed it can't repaint. then you can get an idea of how well the system will really work. im looking at 5 min chart just to see how bad the repaint issue is. - it repaints constantly

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hello members I'm new in this forum, and i'm very interested in this system, but i'm not MT4 user, so can someone write the formula or the logic (when its supossed be the red, green or yellow bar)of the "goldminer" in order to recreate it in my TP. Thank you

--- 帖子 #311 ---
FxCba, The goldminer indicators are part of a system that is being sold elsewhere. I've been looking for the mq4 code as well and finally found the origination of the compiled code.

FxCba, That would be awesome if you can re-create the goldminer signal. I've attached two pictures which are on the 4 hour. I've looked through quite a few systems and even with the re-painting my demo account is up almost 50% for the past 2 weeks trading just two pairs and with a 50 pip stop loss.

Thank you Globalinvest and JHoffmann I'll compare your graphs with mine's let you know how's going

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hello guys, I've tried the original type of system for two days from february the 4th. The original type of system represents Daily TF and three indicators: HMA, goldminer and RSI. Actually, I was afraid of indicators to repaint but just take it for granted and it didn't make me any problems. If I have spear time in weekend, I will get a little bit deeper into the interpretation of indicators and try to see how they react to eath other. With regards to the results, they are awesome. Maybe it's just a luck?! Don't know. I will see in the next few weeks of demoing. But it have already made 190 pips in 4 traders. I'm just looking at this in the very..very critical point of view and trying not to get too enthusiastic. Cheers everybody and have a wild weekend

--- 帖子 #324 ---
globalinvest how did your forward test of RSI/HMA go? What is the repaint on them like?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Mindaugas what sort of stops were you using

--- 帖子 #326 ---
HMA is alright. RSI - repainted 1 bar backwards, example mid-bar it changed from red to yellow with price action, and one bar later, yellow changed to green. Doesn´t really matter with this strategy as you already buy on yellow. But using a regular RSI with a 50 line would work just as fine. You could even skip the goldminer indicator and just use ex: HMA setting at 12. RSI setting at 8 with a line at 50 and use just these 2 indicators. Seems fine on higher timeframes.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
What other pair are you using? I have good success with the Eur/usd, but have been reluctant to try any others as of yet.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
globalinvest, when you say "higher timeframes", what do you mean, daily and more? Regards

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Well... maybe I used the wrong term, as I used 5min charts for a while. I meant 1hour and upwards.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
To avoid any serious damage at first when I open the trade I put simbolicaly 100 pips SL. When the trade goes my way 75 pips I put SL at the open price. When the trade reaches 150 pips my SL is moved 100 pips from the open price in the same direction as the trade. And so on.. The 1st trade did what it have to do The 2nd and the 4th trade(pairs usdchf, gbpchf) was closed because of outcoming news and the weekend. Besides, trades didn't show any enthusiasm to ride. And the last one was quite tricky. I let it ride. But when the news come the pair just droped and touched my SL which was the open price. After few minutes GU shot up and got to the north. GU likes to tease traders Good luck

--- 帖子 #331 ---
It means that this 50% up in your account is due to other systems but not to traffic light ? or it means that you have a 50% up due to the traffic light system but working in the 4H TF using a 50 pip SL? Regards P.D. Sorry because I typed wrong you user name, the correct is JHooffman, but I could not edit.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hello All, Here are my trades so far, I will review later to see if anything else stands out to trade. You may notice I have changed the way I am looking at the charts. The last couple of weeks of poor trades has got me thinking about how I determine which indicators are primary and which are secondary, and what is the best way to look at a chart to see which pairs to trade and which way to go. Before I posted this method I had started out using a CCI indicator that looked at two periods and displayed color bars, like the RSI. But I never really thought it added anything to the base indicators (HMA, RSI, Goldminer). Anyway I started looking at the CCI again and got the idea of displaying it as an overlay to the RSI from anpther thread. Anyway, I think this might give a better sense of where trades might be going so to give a better idea of when to get in and out. I will be playing with it for a while to see how it does for me in live trading. If it proves successfull, I will put out a full explanation for all. The indicator on the bottom of the chart is just something I'm playing with, I'm not really thinking of incorporating it - I want to keep the indicators to a minimum. Mitch

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Mitch How did you get the ATR in the Goldminer and to show at the Top Left?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I'm using the indicator "ATM in Pips" and I just dragged it onto the Goldminer indicator and that's what you get. If you want the indicator I'd be more than happy to attach it. Mitch

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Dibanos, I'm using the Traffic Light only system on the EUR/USD and GBP/USD. As you can see in the 4 hour timeframe, a long signal was given at 0800 Friday morning on the EUR/USD. I got in at 1.2827 with the current quote of 1.2930 and a recent high of 1.2992. Interesting note about goldminer for anybody that cares. Apparently this system was put together and curve matched for USD/JPY. I've looked at the current statistics for this pair and it has performed poorly in the recent past.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Yes if you can that would be great if you can attach it. But set the ATR at 5 when you put your cursor on the candle and open the data window it tells you how much that candle should make it works.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Here is the ATR in Pips indicator

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Ups I did it again

--- 帖子 #339 ---
mitch all the trades you took seem to have worked out though the initially drawdown was quite high, did you stick with it?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Unfortunately I have taken such a beating these last couple weeks (all because I didn't stick with my trades and let the huge draw-down get to me) I didn't stick with them - when will I ever learn. So now I'm waiting till end of day to jump back in and hopefully get some $$ back. My problem has been that I'm entering on Sunday, which isn't necessary a bad thing, I just seem to hit these huge swings lately. Ultimately what I want to do is get into a trade as the CCI is crossing the O line (either up or down) and have my other indicators agree with the trade direction. Then ride the trend for as long as it last and reverse on the next signal - and here's the important part - not exiting just because it's Friday. I believe in this method, you just have to find the best way to trade it (your style). It will give you the pips, just have faith. Mitch

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Mitch, All of us do it - the not sticking to our own rules. I think that you do have a good system. I have been monitoring your system and I used the bull-bear power indicator with it - as you will see, it colaborates the RSI, it also looks good (I'll attach a image). I agree with your idea to make more use of the CCI. J

--- 帖子 #342 ---
hey mitch i think its a great method I'm sure we'll see it evolve as the thread rolls along. personally i think you did the correct thing by exiting your trades today. I'm absolutely sure it was the right thing to do the draw down was quite large and you had several open positions. If you had stuck to it and it had'nt turned around you might not have been able to live to fight another day ..... so to speak. A really great and i mean a really exceptional trader once told me "money missed is better than money lost" I kinda agree with him. Thats why I think you were right in doing what you did. Have you thought about what would have happened if you hadnt cut your trades and they continued to go south?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Not sure how low they went and if I would have had the margin to cover, so I'm ok with it right now. I should be able to get back into a couple trades either today or tomorrow. I'm going to slow it down a bit and hopefully make nice controlled jumps in my equity. It was a fun few weeks when I took the account from $300 to $6500, but I now know that that was a lot of luck.

Hi Mitch, I want to thank you for this system as it has been very successful for me for the past couple of weeks. I wanted to ask how you're trading the system since I noticed you're chart has changed quite a bit from the initial post and post #332. When I look at the chart in #332, it seems that if you had taken trade on 03 Feb, you would be + 600-700 pips. Are you trading signals each day or only on Sunday's? I also don't understand the two different arrows you have on your plots. Thanks, -Jim

Hello It's me again Now i'm working on exits My question is according to last long entry signal, system is still long? or there's an exit advise already? Thank you

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Long EUR/CHF, 150 pips SL.

Hi FxCba, If you're asking me, I will be home in a few hours and will check the signal to see if it is still active. I usually sell on the first Red from the HMA although I reserve the right to get back in if the HMA re-paints and everything lines up green again. -JH

Jim, I will be posting a new chart tonight and explain how I'm looking at things now. Really, not much has changed, I just added CCI. I will also explain my new trading strategy,I had to get away from the Sunday to Friday only method. Mitch

I got side tracked testing a couple of other systems. But I think the Traffic Light system has a lot of merit. For my trading style I think I'll look at setting a reasonable TP and closing trades when I hit it. Also maybe trading fewer pairs that I know better and controlling DD that way. Sandy

We should title this trade Full-Circle. EURUSD - I posted previously the entry point was 1.2827 with a worst case exit of 1.3000 on the 4:00 Central Time Zone. We then had a short signal on the next 4 hour bar (8:00) with an open bar price of 1.3003. As i'm typing the price is....drum roll....1.2826 -Jim

I got an idea while reading the Daily Fozzy. I really like the idea of a RSI overlayed on it's RSI. Of what I've seen it really give a great signal that works really well with this method. But what I'd like to see is an indicator that displays bars - Red if MA is greater than RSI, Yellow if they are equal, and Green is RSI is greater than MA. Any takers? Mitch

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hey, just tried this method and here's my feedback... Initial try, i used this on a cross-currency pair (CHFJPY) on a daily TF. All signs said sell (red HMA, red goldminer, yellow RSI custom). So just like OP said, i went in for the sell (this was around 23:24). Just came back home to check the update, and I was down $1,000; the most i've lost so far in my newborn hobby! I have to put some of the blame on my timing however, as I think I entered too late. Next try, I just went short on EURUSD, and i'll post my results next day (should i choose to stop my order there) But, I'm still looking to take advantage of timing, so, next time I'll place a new order on market open (that's around 5:00AM EST right?)

Stopped out, looking forward for the next trade.

Hello All, Wouldn't you know that the minute I put this system up on FF, all my trades take a dive. So i'm fighting my way back up one trade at a time right now. Now I still believe in this method but I'm looking at the charts in a little different way. Once I truely feel that this new way is better, I will post it. In the mean time, here is what I would have done if I had the equity: Update GBPCHF - Sell @ 1.6826 +164 pips USDSGD - Buy @ 1.5096 -28 pips CHFJPY - Sell @77.91 +7 pips USDJPY - Sell @ 90.39 +32 pips EURJPY - Sell @116.45 +27 pips GBPUSD - Sell @1.4509 +131 pips AUDUSD - Sell @ .6555 -11 pips USDCAD - Buy @ 1.2430 -29 pips AUDJPY - Sell @59.22 +6 pips GBPJPY - Sell @131.15 +157 pips Total = +456 Now in normal times I wouldn't necessarily take all of these but for laughs... Mitch

Look at the chart. Added some rules.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Question? Why do you put the RSI in the charts? You can see clearly that the underlying indicator already tells you the same than the RSI? Doesn't this just overloads the picture? D. PS: What are those added rules?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
It kind of gives you a direction ahead of time Like over bought and over sold, before it changes colour, a little extra Radar you might say. I use also a 4 RSI for Over bought and sold.

Hi Mitch, I've added an adx based indicator and its showing nice results on a backtest. I am using 1 hour tf.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
HI plasmapants Nice charts....can you explain how to exit?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
HI plasmapants how is your adx based indicator setup ? ads period 3? or 2?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
The adx period is 3 and is based on 4hr timeframe (I think this is the standard setting in the indi). You can play around with this to suite. I exit half my position at 40 pips and move sl to 20 pips above/below open to give the trade a chance. Then manually adjust sl to hourly high/low. I also mark daily/high lows, s/r levels, fibo levels and other technicals on my chart which can be used to exit. I have only been using this on demo since last week, but i have enough confidence in the results to go live with it this week. The pic is a visual backtest. It could do with an EA really. (Mr Raygun?)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
please can you explain on your method i.e open and close of daily bar in respect to this method?

--- 帖子 #345 ---

--- 帖子 #347 ---

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hi Behman if u mean ur chart is not updating maybe this will help try right clicking on the chart and clicking on refresh

--- 帖子 #349 ---
With all good intention I put this system out on FF because I was doing so well with it. Since then it's tanked on me and has not shown me any signs of returning to a winning system. I appreciate all the interest and your help to make this a "better" system, but for now I'm looking for the next best thing. Good luck to all. Mitch

--- 帖子 #350 ---
My first post on this thread...To thanks you to have shared with us that system. As you , i am looking to stick on a system , but still couldn't find it . Anyway, thanks you very much to share it with us , and hope you will find the system that fit your needs at the long term run, best luck ... Alex Markov.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hey is anyone here still using this system? I am demoing it and have found it usually is good on certain times of day(ie after 8 pm est).

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi all, let me firstly say that this is a great forum. I have only been a member for 1 month, but the info the members have is great. I stumbled on your system one day ago and have finally got to the last post only to see that it seems that people have lost interest and have moved on... Such is life! The system is very simple I will start a demo trial next week and hopefully start using it live soon after. For those that are still interested, I managed to find the code for the goldminer indicator. I have named it v0 so as not to overwrite the original ex4 that was posted here if you want to have a play with it! All the best, lots of pips for all.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I decided to post after market hours so that I would not interfere with the flow of the thread. This is my first post with you guys, and I have been reading myself blind on this thread. I am New to ff and 1 1/2 year trader with moderate, but not impressive success. I have been looking for a system with very clear signals and on longer time frames. My brain must have a weird way a assimilating information, and this makes scalping much too exciting and intraday trading too irritating. This may be a good one for me. I am watching with much interest, and plan to test it soon on my micro (what I call my "disposable" account before moving it up to my mini. I feel already as if I kinda know most of you, so please have patience with this "knuckle dragger's" questions. Looks excellent to me, Mitch!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
open a buy at day open (i use IBFX and day candles starts at GMT)if signals are correct as per post 1, visa versa for sell

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Thanks, very useful!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi. Great system indeed, thanx for sharing! I have a question for the GOLDMINER2 indicator, which is included in this system. What is his algorithm and logic? I believe we have pretty good programmers here, so my question is easy piece of work for them I think the indicator is very nice, but I'm wondering how it works. The answer will help us all Greetings

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hey Guys, that indicator appears to be redrawing its signals like crazy, so correct backtest cannot be made. Actually it seems to be scam In hyndsight the signals look very good, but in real time they are far below acceptable performance. Damn, these redrawing indicators are so annoying

I've been doing well with goldminer and a few others. I'm typing this quick cause I'm trading....good luck. I'm not going to follow this thread. If you've been suing the goldminer then adding the TDI will take about a night to understand. Add RSI bar indicator Add TDI Add stoch Change the RSI to 8 Go to the end of this thread....it's condensed....forget the rest unless you want details. Go to compassfx.com and watch there video on the cross of the green and red. The TDI I listed has a dotted blue line....any time you cross it....pretty much get out. Don't ask the guys on compass fx about this indicator....it rubs them wrong. Somebody took it and added the dotted blue line. I believe it's a 13ma. Do this: Check long term trend on higher tf's...try to trade in direction of trend. You can go counter but only take a few pips on the lower tf's When goldminer changes wait until green crosses red on the tdi. Check that the 5,3,3 stochastic is maxed on a few tf's up (If going short)...that way they'll all fall like a wave...be careful. They can peg and price can keep running forever. Draw as many trend lines as you can....especially channels. This works smashing with channels....even on the 5 minute. I use the 1 minute to enter and forecast a coming entry. This is one of the most important parts. It will verify all the indicators. This is the kicker. Look for triple taps on the main trend lines....especially on the 1hr, 4hr, daily. They almost always mean a reversal and hard. The third tap on the trend line will usually break thru a bit. up to 50 pips on the higher tf's....5 to 10 on the lower. Prepare for it to swing around and drop. Find the channels. I use this on the 15m, 5m, 1m charts. after I find the three taps on the higher tf's...Find the triple taps on the lower times too. The are good entry points when all the indicators line up. When you get a grip on the tdi....this works like magic. Exit when the green line in the TDI crosses the red or the stoch turns up at the other end. Remember find the channels...even on the 5 minute. They verify all the other stuff. Here's two good examples I just traded...notice when the green line crosses the red. Notice the stoch turning up. Notice the other indicators. The red verticle lines are the third tap on the trend lines. Notice how the price goes wild when green crosses the dotted blue line....5 min chart. The purple tl is the bottom of the up channel. It triple tapped the red channel coming down and the purple tl going up. Enter when green breaks red completely. The second trend line is a short....notice how green comes down over the blue. Then crosses red. When it's high ignore the dotted blue line....except to exit. If it ever goes back over the dotted blue in the opposite direction....just get out and take the loss. Look at the 15 minute to make sure the stoch is also maxed. use the 1 min to enter...1m to exit if you want P.S. !!!!! I was reading another post and it reinforced what I've seen on the 1 min 5 min charts. This is a scalpers dream when you "Get it" 1. Use the yellow bar in the RSI as an entry indicator. If it turns yellow on the 5min....drop to the 1 min and make sure it agrees with the 5min. 2. Make sure stochastic is maxed or below the 20 (line - for a long) or above 80 line (short) with the green line crossing over 3. Look for the green crossing red in the TDI. I turn off the trend text in the TDI...also add my own 32,50,83 lines in tdi) 4. work within a channel....be sure you are not coming up on a major support or resistence line...if you are it takes presidense over the channel line but only if it is a major line.... 5. use the 1 min to enter exit....It trade both ways...counter trade also....only take a few pips on the 1 minute. You'll get it after a bit. 6. Be sure to look at 1hr, 4hr charts...find the trend....look for trend lines. Especially a third tap on that line. They fall and reverse 70% of the time 7. To start concentrate on entering at top and bottom of main channel...draw smaller channels as you trade within the channel. Use TL's to see where price breaks up and down. Price falls...tl over price....price rises...tl under price. 8. Price will almost always come down to tap the main channel trend line three times...on third tap be aware it may fall thru the main channel tl line slightly then pop back up. (for a short) 9. Put a fib on the 5min....if it breaks thru the third tap, look to see if there's a major fib line. It will probably fall to that line...especially the 61.8 fib. Redraw the major channel line after it finishes it's fall thru the botom channel line. If it falls below the major s/r line or fib line then the channel has probably ended. 10. I understated this.....if you are trading both ways. To determine a counter trend. Watch when green tdi line crosses the blue dotted line. It's usually officially retracing. If it's at the bottom of the channel line then bingo!!!! go if all other indicators agree! Decide entry from the green / blue dotted TDI line on the 5 min chart. Don't go past zero pips losted if it retraces back over the blue line. you usually won't need more then 10 pips sl.....don't use it....use 30 or so for spike protection. Or nearest major pivot. The longest runs usually happen after the green TDI line crosses up or down over the dark blue solid lines in the tdi. If you watch goldminer then you'll notice it pretty much changes on retrace....not small changes in trend. The rsi changes almost immediately. If the 15m and 30 min stoch is maxed up and falling...move up a time frame and watch all the indicators.
