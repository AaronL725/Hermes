Welcome,

I used to post updates of my little Expert Advisor in the Trading Made Simple forum. However as I forsee that I will have several versions to go before it turns into a useful EA that one can trust with a real account I decided to start this thread to make it easy for everyone to follow my progress and to add comments to this specific take on Trading Made Simple.

To learn the TMS way of trading you can go to the Trading Made Simple Thread:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622

Note: This programming project is still in an early stage and the versions (that I regularly post here) are not intended for real trading.As of version 13 you might run the EA on a demo account and manually copy the trades that you like to a real account. As of version 18 the EA will trade real accounts for 26 weeks. After that period you will have to move on to a newer version.

Previous & current versions can be found here:

Thanks. As traders we can use all the help we can get.

If you are considering to develop a trade manager type of expert advisor,

You may want to include the use of on-chart objects to execute limit and stop orders .

For example, the use of segment lines on chart with specific line object names such as - buy limit, sell limit, buy stop, sell stop, buy SL, sell SL, buy target1, buy target2, sell target1, sell target2 etc. depending on your exit strategy.

your expert advisor must be able to detect these objects and execute the trades and manage thereafter.

see Tipster thread.

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=526703

other than the use of segment lines on chart, there are a lot more other objects (wingdings code) on charts which you can program in your trade manager to activate trade functions.

Have fun!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for your comments. I never saw the Tipster's Trade Manager before. But it looks very good. I will study this thread next week (as I finally have a week off work).

Later this weekend I will post here my plan for how I plan to proceed with my expert advisor. I will definitely include MEME and the use of SR-lines in a similar way that RickM has recently explained in the TMS forum. It's no coincidence that I programmed that SR-Lines tool that I posted in the TMS forum. That tool stores SR-Lines in a format that I can use in my EA.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #6 ---
when you have those SR lines drawn on your monthly charts and also on the weekly charts, you can write an EA and perform count of the number of times the TDI (RSI MA) crosses in M5 between any two of the SR lines.

hint: Use the TDI(RSI MA) M5 cross for trade entries.... between the buy and sell zones identified by your selected SR lines in HTF.

the rest is risk and money management.

... more next , will be on exit strategies, trade management.

In this thread I will describe my journey of developing an Expert Advisor for the TMS method. For an extensive discussion on how this method works I refer to the thread about "Trading Made Simple". https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622

In this thread I like to focus the discussion on the techniques that I use to get from a written and well documented trading method to an implementation as an Expert Advisor. So I do not discuss if TMS is a good method or not. The thing is, with developing a program, one has to choose what the program is supposed to do. And then stick to it. Otherwise, when the definition of what needs to be done keeps changing, programs will never be finished.

Many traders (including very experienced ones) claim that it is not possible to create a fully automated trading program. And they may be right. The outcome of this journey therefore might be that we merely achieve an approximation of a succesfull trading program. On the other hand, parts of the trading proces are definitely suitable for automation.

My goals are:Create a good TMS trade-manager. A trade-manager is an Expert Advisor that does not initiate any trades, but manages trades that are otherwise initiated.Monitor trades for exit conditions Break-even detection Profit protection Managing Stop Loss, Take Profit and Trailing Stop Apply Multiple Entries and Multiple Exits (MEME)  Abilty to initiate trades based on the mechanical rules. The mechanical rules are a set of rules that mostly based on simply reading hard data from indicators or price action.Detect entry conditions based on PAC or 5MA Detect entry conditions based on TDI Detect entry conditions based on Stochastic Detect entry conditions based on trend  Additional entry conditionsPosition of Support and resistance lines Price Action Patterns  So thats it for now.

Cheers...

Many versions

When I start with a new EA-project I immediately start creating versions. Every major change gets a new version. I do it like that because I have learned that it is not wise to fiddle with existing code of a working program. If the new change doesn't work out it's easy to go back to the previous version. It is however nearly impossible to undo changes to restore a broken program to its former working state.

Because I develop my project in these steps it follows that for a new project, version 1.00 is usually not a working version. Simply because not all necessary parts are yet finished. It usually takes me a couple of versions to have a first working version of my EA-project. (A "working" version in this sense means it implements the basic strategy. Not that it actually is a "succesful" trading engine).

The versions that I publish in this thread have all been tested for at least a month on a demo account. Some parts of the code are stable from the very first version, and hence have been tested for many months. Some parts of the code are inherited from previous projects and hence have been tested for years.

At the time of writing I have posted version 1.09 a couple of days ago. At this time I am working on versions 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13. All of these versions have significant additions or changes that I want to develop further as a separate version. I don't like adding too many changes between versions, so I'll do it step by step.

As long as version 1.10 is not posted I will add bugfixes to version 1.09 if the bug is serious enough to need a quick fix. So version 1.09, the last published version, can be regarded as the current "stable" version.

Cheers...

Version 1.10, whats new?
Inserted Code * 15-09-2017 Version 1.10
* - Using the class cl_symbol where possible.
* - Better messages on screen about status.
* - No new orders after 18:00 on friday.
* - Close positive orders on friday after 23:50.
* - Some classes are now suitable for multi-curency and multi-timeframe
*   operation. This is needed if we want this program to run on a single
*   instance but still trade multiple currencies.
* - Exit trade when we are under 3 pips profit and the MA10 on M1 is against us.
* - Make use of extra ma_fast and ma_slow optional.
* - Set BE SL when the price reaches BE trigger. The old algo would wait
*   for the current bar to finish and then set BE to the LOW of the previous bar
*   (the one just completed) if that would be above the open-price.
* - Made PAC-check a separate function.
* - Made MA-check a separate function.
* - Redesigned code to check the conditions from the TDI.
From this list you might get an idea what I means when I say that a new development deserves a new version. Even if the end-result might not show it that obvious in the way users see the finished product. A lot has been going on under the hood.

Working with classes

I love the MQL programming language. It supports both ""procedural" programming and "object-oriented" programming. When you read books about OO-programming it is often assumed that one will use either one or the other apprach. However I like to mix both methods so I can enjoy the benefits of both.

I use classes in a little bit different way then what you might find in official OO-progrtamming textbooks. I like to keep things simple, so I will use classes when I think they will make my programming life easier. For me that means that I usually create a class to simply combine a structure and all the methods that work with that structure. Usually I leave it at that and and stay clear of the more complex stuff that one could do with classes. Usually I leave inheritance and polymorphism to a bare minimum.

I will create and use classes:When a certain structure or object clearly needs its own handling routines. When I think I might re-use the structure of object on other projects. When I find that my main programming file becomes to cluttered and I can combine certain tasks in a separate class (or include file).

Example of an include: I have made a library of extended string handling functions. That is just a collection of functions that would otherwise clutter my main programming file. Some example code from that include:
Inserted Code /** before
* ------
* This function returns the part of a string BEFORE a certain
* search pattern. If the pattern is not found then the whole
* string s is returned.
*
* s   The string to search
* pat The pattern to search for
* pos The position to start searching
*/
string strBefore(const string &s, const string &pat, const int pos = 0) {
int it = StringFind(s, pat, pos);
//if (it <= StringLen(s))
if (it > -1)
return strMid(s, 0, it);
else
return s;

}
string strBefore(const string &s, const char c, const int pos = 0) {
string s_pat;
StringInit(s_pat,1,c);
return strBefore(s,s_pat,pos);
}

/** after
* -----
* This function returns the part of a string AFTER a certain
* search pattern. If the pattern is not found then the empty
* string s is returned.
*
* s   The string to search
* pat The pattern to search for
* pos The position to start searching
*/
string strAfter(const string &s, const string &pat, const int pos = 0) {
int    it;
string x = "";
int slen = StringLen(s);
int plen = StringLen(pat);
it = StringFind(s, pat, pos);
if ( it > -1)
x = strMid(s, it + plen, slen - it - plen);
return x;
}
string strAfter(const string &s, const char c, int pos = 0) {
string s_key;
StringInit(s_key,1,c);
return strAfter(s,s_key,pos);
}

Example of a class: I have made a set of classes to make the usage of certain indicators a lot easier (Moving Average, Stochastic, HA, TDI, PAC). The class that I show below is called 'cl_symbol' and it contains methods that I frequently use when I want to know something about the symbol that I am trading with. The reason I collected all those functions in a class is because it will make a move from MT4 to MT5 easier. In MT5 there is already a class for handling symbols that MetaQuotes has prepared. So when that day comes I can keep adaptations to my main program to a minimum as I only have to adapt this class for handling the new symbol-related functions.

Happy New Year! I just came across  this thread just now. I'm interested in this EA and I think it has a lot of potential. By the way, may I know what indicators to be attached to the chart in order for the EA to function?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The Long and Winding Road. Putting EA's together seems so so complicated. Good luck with this project and Happy New Year

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You do not have to attach any indicator to the chart. The EA will do that itself internally. However the TDI indicator must be available in your indicators folder as shown in this post. The TDI indicator does not come standard with MetaTrader4 so You must add it yourself. Please refer to this post:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post10125984

The installation instructions are straitforward, but if you are not sure this post describes a similar procedure for installing a script. Of course for installing an indicator you would have to open the Indicators-folder instead of the Script folder:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...1#post10043041

And this is the Indicator that you need. I got this from the TMS thread so I am reposting it as is:

What I actually try to do is simply translate an excisting trading approach into a program so that it can do some of the tasks automatically. It might seem complicated at first, but hey, if you would write down all steps and decisions that YOU would make to open and manage a trade it would probably be a lot more complicated. By writing a program a lot of time is spend in finding out, in micro-steps, what a human would do in certain circumstances. And therefore it also helps in mastering a proces better.

It must be in this folder: ....\indicators\bim\tms\

Please refer to this post: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post10125984

There are many versions available of the TDI-Indicator. Most people that trade the Trading Made Simple method have several versions of the TDI Indicator in their Indicators folder. Therefore I decided to use a unique folder for the indicators that my program uses. Just to prevent any confusion.

Hi all,

I just published version 1.10. See post #1 for downloads.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I have updated version 10 in post 1. The opening of trading after the new year revealed a small bug. I was already filtering that any trade must be in the direction of the next higher timeframe. I now added that it must also be in the direction of the next-next higher timeframe.

Example: You have the EA running on the H4. It wil now only open a buy if both the D1 and W1 are moving up!

Hi Abhimanyu,

thank you for testing. Your work is really appreciated.

The error that you get means the following: When the EA wants to open an order it has to send (as a parameter) the price it is willing to pay for the order. Unfortunately when the broker processes the order it finds that the offered price (by the EA) is out of the range that the broker is willing to accept. So the broker sends a signal back: Error 138 which means that a requote is needed. In other words, the broker asks the EA to make a new bid, probably with less favourable conditions.

I have never had this error before, so I suspect it is broker related. However I found a couple of remedies for this error that I can try. I will post an updated version this weekend so as of next week you might try it again.

This is a re-release of version 9.

I will from now on release new- or updated versions as normal posts, and then update a link in post #1 to point to the last update of a version. Of course I try not to re-release previously posted versions but sometimes its the easiest way to release a small bug-fix.

This is a re-release of version 10.

This bugfix should solve a problem with SendOrder code 138 (Requote).

Version 10 generates lots of orders but a lot of them go nowhere. This version should be used only for demo purposes.

Inserted Code  * 15-09-2017 Version 1.10
* - Using the class cl_symbol where possible.
* - Better messages on screen about status.
* - No new orders after 18:00 on friday.
* - Close positive orders on friday after 23:50.
* - Some classes are now suitable for multi-curency and multi-timeframe
*   operation. This is needed if we want this program to run on a single
*   instance but still trade multiple currencies.
* - Exit trade when we are under 3 pips profit and the MA10 on M1 is
*   against us.
* - Make use of extra ma_fast and ma_slow optional.
* - Set BE SL when the price reaches BE trigger. The old algo would wait
*   for the current bar to finish and then set BE to the LOW of the
*   previous bar (the one just completed) if that would be above the
*   open-price.
* - Made PAC-check a separate function.
* - Made MA-check a separate function.
* - Redesigned code to check the conditions from the TDI.

Changelog:
Inserted Code  * 17-12-2017 Version 1.11
* - Version 1.10 now has the correct entry mechanics for standard PAC
*   trading. Version 1.11 will add correct exit mechanics for standard
*   PAC. The rest is optimisation of existing code. No new functionality.
* - Made STO-check a separate function.
* - Made TDI-check a separate function.
* - Made exit-check for changing HA-color a separate function.
* - Bugfix: The checks of the lower timeframes MA1 and MA5 were actually
*   checking the current timeframe and always bar[0] which makes testing
*   difficult. This is now fixed.
* - Made MA5-check a separate function (not stable yet).
* - Made HIST check a separate function.
Remember: As said for all the previous versions, this version is still in a test phase and should under no circumstances be used on a real account. I am testing my new versions on the H4 timeframe, but trading with the PAC strategy (which is the default setting) might actually work better on de D1 timeframe.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Notes for version 11

In the changelog you see a reference to a HIST function. This is not a term that you will find in the official TMS thread. During testing I noticed that sometimes a trade comes on, and is closed after a while but still on the same H4 bar. It is then possible that a second trade might start on that same bar when all the conditions line up. However, I found that the chance that a second- or even third trade ends in profit are significantly lower. So I decided to allow maximum one single trade per bar. My HIST function -ntr_chk_hist()- simply checks when the last order for a given currency-pair was opened or closed. The open- and close time are then used to make sure that no new trade on the same bar can start.

Version 11 is a lot more stable then version 10 and its trading is more sensible. In fact after doing a post mortem on the trades that went nowhere it turned out that they all would have made green pips if MEME would have been used. The MEME technique will be introduced in version 12 so that is definetly something to look out for.

If the readers of this thread are able to run version 11 on a demo account then I would kindly request that you post some of the trades that your system has come up with.

Cheers...

MEME-Trade, what is it?

I am not going to try to come up with an official definition. For that I refer to the official TMS thread. But this is a small example:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Note that this is a screenshot from the H1 timeframe, but the first trade was done in the H4 timeframe.

My initial trade went nowhere and under normal circumstances it would have been stopped by a stop-loss. However, because I was convinced that this trade was good and eventually would go in the direction that I initially anticipated... I decided to enter a second, and later a third trade. With multiple trades it takes a bit of calculation to determine what the preferred take-profit level is, but i managed to close my MEME trade with a couple of EUR profit.

Cheers...

Hi Jan,

one suggestion for MEME trade management is to use Profit Lock when you have 3 or more positions in MEME.

see comments in your chart.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

the management will be he same even when you have 2 open positions, you 'lock the profits' at the breakeven level of 2 positions and exit both positions when M5 (TDI or MACD) cross up for sell.

Hello Jansb000,

thank you very much for the expert und that you share it here!

I've done a test with the V1.11 and my problem is that it is very slow.......after ending I see that over 200(!!) TDI-indicators are opened...is that right?

best regards

Thorsten

Hi there

No appropriate TDI indicator is running in EA.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Deichkind,

Thank you for testing. I noticed that the EA is slow and therefore difficult to test and optimise in the stategy tester. However, I never found the reason why (apart from that a custom indicator is slower than the build-in indicators).

How do you know that there are >200 TDI indicators? Where would I be able to see that? As far as I am concerned there is no reason for so many TDI Indicators. So it is definitely not part of a strategy that I deliberately build in.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Fung,

when running an Expert Advisor, the used indicators are not visible on the chart. They are however in the computer memory and the EA can acces the data they produce without problems. If you want to see the TDI on your screen you have to manually add it to your chart.

Although the EA is attached to a chart, the chart does not graphically represent all the data that the EA has access to. And that would be difficult too, as LRSF-EA uses indicators on several timeframes at the same time.

I will try, for version 12, to make it clear on screen that the TDI is succesfully loaded. Have to think of a good way to do that.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Emmanuel,

Thank you for that excellent analysis.

The way I currently do it is to simply calculate a TP where the open trades (combined) will make x amount of pips profit. (x = ADR-100 / 2). So all the trades are all given the same TP. Currently that is not yet under control of the EA. It's a manual action.

For the EA, i am just now in the process of making it MEME enabled. And I will definitly try to take this advise into account.

For the trade posted earlier, I checked the TDI on M5. As it turns out, the TDI Red, Green were actually crossing up near the point of where the TP was. (This was totally coincidence as the TP was calculated manualy). But lets suppose that this was the situation the EA had to deal with. I think it would still have to close the third trade near to the TP because of the crossing up of the red-green. Do you agree?

Hi Jansb000,

when the test is over the screen looks like this :

when I do a left-click on the screen and open the indicator-line I will see this:

I hope this can help you understanding what I mean. when I scroll up the indicator window I see 1x Heiken Ashi, 2x MAs and 251 TDIs.

The screen shows which indicators are used from the EA but why are this so much? A good question!

do you use the TDI green red or the TDI RT_clone indicator? Will that make sence to change?

I have a TDI from the TMS-thread. There are now so many versions of TDI around that I am not sure which one exactly I have, but it came with source code and there is nothing suspicious as far as I can see. I re-posted this version in this thread:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post10631496

If you, or anyone else reading this, has another version of TDI and used it without any problems in other EA-projects, then I wouldn't mind trying them. I am using the red, green and yellow line so just the red-green is not enough for me. Alternatively, I might fall back on TDI simulation using the RSI indicator, but I think it would be better if we can find out what is causing this problem.

Unfortunately i do not have a lot of time this weekend as I have to finish some tasks for my business.

Good thing is, that I have version 11 (and previous all earlier versions) running on 28 pairs on my computer and it seems to run fine.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Jansb000,

I've now taken the TDI from your link and deleted my old ones. But the problem is still there  Works slowly, doesn't open a trade and at the end more then 200 TDIs are opened on the tester-end-screen in visual-mode

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Deichkind,

Thank you for your effort to run this EA through the strategy tester. Would it be possible for you to do the same test with some of the older versions? It would be interesting to know when this problem was introduced or if it was there from the start.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I have had problems with a tdi indicator like this in the past. Perhaps you could use the RSI or macd equivalents. I believe they may also be faster.

Hi Jansb000,

Hi all,

While working on version 12 and 13 I ran into a couple of small bugs that are also present in earlier versions.
Inserted Code * - Bugfix: The HIST-check sometimes returned the wrong result. This lead to
*   very few trades. Made EA think that a previous trade was just closed.
* - Bugfix: The SoftBreakEven was triggered way to early. Fixed. SoftBreakEven
*   would be activated after just 5 pips instead of the planned 10 pips. Once
*   activated it would close a trade when it came under 3 pips profit. This
*   happened for nearly every good trade. Maybe for MEME trading this can be
*   switched OFF altogether. But that needs testing.
I corrected these bugs also in version 11 leading to version 11_1.

Managing expectation

Last week I had version 12 running on my demo account. Worked ok, but still had some bugs that are related to using conventional restrictions while using MEME. Anyway, we are getting there. After version 12 is completely debugged it will server very fine as a trade manager. That means one still has to find the entry manually, but after that LRSF will take the stress away by handling the trade.

Remember that this EA can also trade automatically, but that is not ideal yet. Far from it. As one can see with version 11.1, there are many trades, but too many are going nowhere. However, for those who understand TMS and can place a trade manually will be happy with the extra help. Now, there are some really good traders in the TMS thread that regulary post excellent trades using MEME and by cleverly using the position of the support and resistance (SR)-lines. Version 12 will have some support for MEME, but don't expect it to be just as good as those ace traders. SR-Lines are not supported in version 12.

The release of version 12 is still scheduled for next weekend.

Cheers...

Version 13 in action last night

Had a lot of trouble this week with finding a nasty bug that prevented opening any trade for most of the week. Finally managed to solve it yesterday. Now woke up to a couple of 'green' trades. All in all I had to catch a couple of bugs/changes this week as it turned out that the adding of MEME functionality had a big impact on the functions that I initially wrote to handle just one order at the same time.

Notice that the first trade started when the TDI-Green was below the TDI-Yellow. That's because the screenshot was taken on the H1 timeframe. Trading happens in the H4 timeframe.

Hi all,

The changelist is pretty long. Mostly because the addition of MEME functions required a lot of modifications to the existing code.
Inserted Code  * 19-10-2017 Version 1.12
* - Added the class cl_atr_basis. This basis-class is needed to work with
*   specific trade-goals that are meaningfull for the current currency-pair.
* - Added the class cl_macd_basis. This basis-class is needed to improve
*   the quality of the trade-signals. (however: not used yet)
* - Added an include "sr_line_function" to handle support and resistance lines.
*   This include is also used in the script to create a file with SR-lines.
* - Change PAC to normal MA5. Not the version from HA-APB.
* - Breaking the PAC means that both the real-bar and the HA-bar close
*   outside the channel.
* - Added the BigE entry method (MA5) for entering an order.
* - MEME: close_position() will now close multiple orders and pending orders.
* - MEME: ADR(100) is now calculated and updated in variable gADR100.
* - MEME: LIMIT orders are now created, but without TP and SL.
* - Bugfix: The break-even stop-loss was triggered too late in some cases.
* - Bugfix: The copy-constructor for cl_order was not working. This is now
*   fixed, and also the performance is now a lot better.
* - Optimised cl_order::open(). Now returns ticketnumber instead of bool.

Inherited from version 1.13
* - Made MA5-check a separate function.
* - Trade-condition for TDI was too strict. Is now simplified.
* - Bugfix: The HIST-check sometimes returned the wrong result. This lead to
*   very few trades. Made EA think that a previous trade was just closed.
* - MEME: TP and SL are now created and updated when a new limit order gets hit.
* - MEME: Despite the TP setting, when the profit is positive and RSI5 is against
*   us the position will be closed.
* - Bugfix: The SoftBreakEven was triggered way to early. Fixed. SoftBreakEven
*   would be activated after just 5 pips instead of the planned 10 pips. Once
*   activated it would close a trade when it came under 3 pips profit. This
*   happened for nearly every good trade. Maybe for MEME trading this can be
*   switched OFF altogether. But that needs testing.
* - Bugfix [multiple]: In the added lines for MEME I often used spread instead
*   of spread_value for calculation.
* - Bugfix: The HIST-check had another bug which more or less disabled trading
*   altogether after fixing the first bug.
* - Security: Added some tests to ensure proper usage of the EA.
As you can see I did a lot of work on version 13, and decided to downgrade the solved bugs to version 12 also. Version 12 will now use MEME.

Have fun testing this version. Feel free to give feedback. Note that this version will only work on a demo account. We have to make sure that this version is stable before taking the next step.

Hi all,

found a little bug in version 12:When the 5th MEME order opens (like I have now for AUDNZD) the TP and SL are not correctly updated.

However you can manually drag them to a desired location. This weekend I will publish version 12.1 that solves this little bugger.

Last week was an interesting week I would say. We definitely made some money. But near the end of the week we saw several trades where MEME had to kick in. So the drawdown on the demo account is now over EUR 240. It's going to be interesting to see if MEME can correct this hefty drawdown.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
The main reason for a large drawdown is that I test on 28 pairs at the same time. So we get plenty of trades, but that leads to overheated trading. What I plan to do is to quickly limit the amount of concurrent active trades:I will limit trading over all 28 pairs to just one active trade. This will be a quick fix to get the DD under control. (Manually starting a trade will remain possible of course). Next, I will make that filter a bit more advanced and only allow one trade in each currency group. This will allow more trades, but never on the same currency-pairs. They should be all independent. Next, I will make the filter yet more advanced and allow more trades once the previous trades within a currency group are positive and the SL is moved to at least break-even. These are the groups:
Inserted Code const s_symdata t_symnm[] = {
/* 01 */ { "AUDCAD", 5 },

hi, i try to backtest this EA but its showing test period expired, please download latest EA

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Other observations made this week:While using PAC as my entry strategy I noticed that a lot of the time the trades do not start at the best possible moment. Sometimes they start when a series of HA candles is clearly showing signs of exhaustion. The trick must be to enter a trade on the very first bar that fullfills the PAC entry strategy. If that trade is missed for some reason, so be it. Wait for another opportunity. We saw this week that with 28 pairs there are plenty of opportunities. Quite a few trades are taken out at break-even, only to see later bars going in the direction that my original trade was going. However my break-even also saved a couple of bad trades, specially those created by the problem of late entry (see the observation above). I will have to solve the above problem first before looking into this one. My MA5 entry strategy (already available in version 12) is not yet tested properly (and buggy). But for trading on H4 this strategy, when looking at it, appears to outperform the PAC entry strategy. So I will definetely start looking into this. Nevertheless the PAC method has to work reliable as well. Cheers...

Hi jansb000,

do I have to put the EA only on one chart and he trades on all pairs or do I need one chart per pair?

regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks for testing,

Strange, I will look into this. Every test-version should be active for at least 3-4 months after compile date.

Edit: Maybe this problem occurs because of the usage of the back-test / strategy-tester. Deichkind reported this.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
The current version must be installed per pair. I am working on getting it universal but that is still not completely finished. The check on currently open pairs that I spoke of earlier (post 52) is the first try to read orders from another pair. That is exactly why I build that trade filter in 3 small steps.

Edit: You could limit to just 8 pairs (or less). Preferably choose the pairs with the lowest spread. Or 1 from each currency group. When trading on H4 you should get a trade or two every week on every pair. Also try to keep the charts as clean as possible. Every indicator takes up memory. With 28 pairs that can accumulate to a lot of used memory.

Hi, first up thanks for your work! Can I make a few suggestions to your TMS EA?The EA only has to be put on one chart and it will trade all timeframes and all pairs (can be modified in EA properties) When it actually open a trade (according to big e’s rules) it will also display the timeframe (e.g. eur/usd h1) The EA will work on both DEMO and LIVE account Thank you for your time and work!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi zhangshuo,

thank you for your suggestions. Here are my answers/comments:a) Trading multiple pairs:

This is indeed what I want. However, at this moment not all code in my EA is able to run for any pair other than the one in the active chart. (A lot of my code is inherited from earlier projects). Every time I encounter a piece of code that is not ready for multiple currency trading I try to deal with it. However every version comes closer to this goal. Version 13 will have the first function where it will check what other trades from other charts are open before it opens a new trade.

b) Trading all timeframes is not possible at this moment. I recommend trading on H4 or D1. Once I get consistent results I might add H1 during certain hours. This would be like BigE traded. Other timeframes are technically possible but I do not support them.
It already does that. In the terminal you have to switch on the "Comments". There you can see which timeframe is used to open the trade. See post 51 for an example.
Up to version 11 it worked for both DEMO and LIVE, but until it makes consistent good trades I decided to have it working on DEMO only. I am too scared that unexperienced and unpatient traders will go LIVE with an EA that is not yet stable. Publishing trading software brings responsibility and this is how I deal with that. Eventually I will release a fully functional version. (as a trade manager it does work on LIVE accounts already. But make sure you test this on a DEMO account before trying that on a LIVE account). Cheers...

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi, jansb000:

thank you for your reply!

can you consider this suggestion: the ea will be placed on several charts, each chart with a different timeframe, and every ea will trade all pairs of the trader's choosing for that timeframe. Is this easier and feasible?

actually a fully-functioning ea working on DEMO is all I want. I want to use this ea as a trade-spotting tool so that every time it opens a trade I can go to that pair and timeframe and analyze before putting on the trade in my live account (my trading rule is a little different from big e's). That 's why I'm asking for multiple pairs and timeframes as well as which timeframe the trade is on.

hope you can consider that. Once again thank you for your work!

Shuo

but it still error (order send error 138)

Appreciate the work Jan, will try this out now.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Aha, now I understand where you want to go. The multiple currencies is a "work in progress". Within a couple of versions it should be available. For now the workaround is to install it on every pair individually. The multiple timeframes as you describe can only be done with variable MagicNumbers. I will make the Magic Number variable from version 13 onwards. That should help you start. Also I am planning that the EA can send notifications once a trading opportunity is found. I will try to get that into version 13 as well.

Thanks for constructive thinking.

The changes in this version are:
Inserted Code  * 10-11-2017 Version 1.13
* - Made MA5-check a separate function.
* - Trade-condition for TDI was too strict. Is now simplified.
* - INTERACTIVE: Added function DrawButton(). This will help creating an
*   interactive mode as opposed against fully automatic trtading.
* - Bugfix: The HIST-check sometimes returned the wrong result. This lead to
*   very few trades. Made EA think that a previous trade was just closed.
* - MEME: TP and SL are now created and updated when a new limit order gets hit.
* - MEME: Despite the TP setting, when the profit is positive and RSI5 is against
*   us the position will be closed.
* - Bugfix: The SoftBreakEven was triggered way to early. Fixed. SoftBreakEven
*   would be activated after just 5 pips instead of the planned 10 pips. Once
*   activated it would close a trade when it came under 3 pips profit. This
*   happened for nearly every good trade. Maybe for MEME trading this can be
*   switched OFF altogether. But that needs testing.
* - Bugfix [multiple]: In the added lines for MEME I often used spread instead
*   of spread_value for calculation.
* - Bugfix: The HIST-check had another bug which more or less disabled trading
*   altogether after fixing the first bug.
* - Security: Added some tests to ensure proper usage of the EA.
And the following changes have been downgraded from version 14:
Inserted Code  * 29-01-2018 Version 1.14
* - Main aim of this version is to get the EA working with mini-accounts.
* - Comments of MEME orders changed to match other orders.
* - Class cl_tdi now also supports checks on RSI.
* - Bugfix: The MEME calculation for TP and SL could end in division by zero.
* - It is now checked that there is maximum of one active order for all open
*   pairs with this EA. If an open order is found, no new trade will start.
* - PAC entry strategy now checks if we are at the start of a new series.
*   This should prevent opening new trades near the end of a series of HA
*   candles where the trend is exhausted.
* - Made MagicNumber a variable.
* - Now sends a notification once a trade starts. This can be used to have
*   this EA on a demo account and manually copy the best ones on your real
*   account.
Feel free to download this version and have a go with it on a test-account.

You might like what you see.

Hi,

When you see a good opportunity (according to Trading Made Simple) you want to be able to start a trade and use this EA as a trade manager.

With the two scripts presented here you can quickly start new trades with the correct MagicNumber.

Note that these scripts will also work for REAL accounts. The EA will also work as a Trade Manager on REAL accounts.

However, make sure you test the behaviour first on a demo account before you jump into the deep end.

The EA is still under development, including its functioning as a Trade Manager. Please give feedback here so we can all learn from your experiences.

Hi nbelchior,

just remember to set this variable to "Just Monitor" and then use the scripts to enter trades.

It will work as a Trade Manager on a REAL account.

This is the changelog:
Inserted Code  * 29-01-2018 Version 1.14
* Main aim of this version is to get the EA working with mini-accounts.
* - Comments of MEME orders changed to match other orders.
* - Class cl_tdi now also supports checks on RSI.
* - Bugfix: The MEME calculation for TP and SL could end in division by zero.
* - The comments for MEME trades is changed to make it more in line with the
*   first order.
* - It is now checked that there is maximum of one active order for all open
*   pairs with this EA. If an open order is found, no new trade will start.
* - PAC entry strategy now checks if we are at the start of a new series.
*   This should prevent opening new trades near the end of a series of HA
*   candles where the trend is exhausted.
* - Added functions to class cl_symbol for representing a symbol by a single
*   index from 0-27. This is faster for further processing when we want to
*   check multiple symbols and limit the number of trades per currency-group.
* - Added a class cl_srline_basis to hold data for a SR-Line.
* - Added 3 rectangles that show the trend of the current, next and nextnext
*   timeframe.
* - Made MagicNumber a variable.
* - Now sends a notification once a trade starts. This can be used to have
*   this EA on a demo account and manually copy the best ones on your real
*   account.

And the following changes have been downgraded from version 15:
Inserted Code * - Added a description to the start dialog.
* - Bugfix: ENTRY_5METHOD, in function ntr_check() we were looking at the wrong
*   bar-offset to determine if the pricebar broke the MA5.
* - Bugfix: ENTRY_5METHOD, in function ntr_check_tdi() we were looking at the wrong
*   bar-offset to check if there was a TDI-cross or continuation signal.
* - Bugfix: Closing profitable records before the weekend does now use TimeCurrent()
*   in stead of TimeGMT().
* - On demo-accounts orders for several pairs may be open at the same time. On real-
*   accounts it remains a limit of one pair that may have open orders. (one original
*   order and some meme orders if needed). The main reason for this change is to
*   generate more test-data.

Intermediate status report

So where are we now with this Expert Advisor? With version 14 we definetly made some great progress. The entries for the PAC mechanism are ok, but not always perfect. It turns out that detecting the exact best entry of the PAC strategy is not easy, but we are doing ok I think. The exit-strategy for PAC still needs improvement as too many orders are taken out with the break-even protection. This often leads to orders that come out with just 40 cents profit.

The MEME mechanism works very good. It saves a couple of trades every week. The multiple exit part of MEME is not yet implemented so all orders will close at one single TP. So its actually a MESE mechanism. But I will improve the exit mechanism in a future version of the EA.

Exit strategies in general need more testing and tuning as way to many orders are taken out by the break-even protection. Often only to see that if the break-even would have not been triggered we would have gotten a perfect trade. So there is still work to do here.

Support and Resistance lines are still not incorporated. This leads to some trades that are opened very close to a support or resistance line. This has now a high priority on my to-do list. The thing is, when a trade opens into a support line there is a chance that it will immediatly change direction. In most cases MEME will solve this, but eventually a big counter trend might be to much for MEME. When the EA is aware of where the SR-lines are the chances of a pear-shaped trade are a lot less.

So, my friends, still a lot to do.

I have now started to run this EA on a (very small) real account. I let the EA choose its trades, but I sometimes close a trade manually when I think it has reached it's top. Apart from this I also use my scripts to add a second or third trade manually. Note however that when you have a poor hand and all trades turn into MEME trades, this can lead to a considerable drawdown. So stick to one or maximum two open trades. Once profit is locked in you can add more trades.

Please feel free to post your experiences here. We all want to learn from each other.

Cheers...

any live trading performance for this EA?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi rick2flee,

this EA is still in a development and testing phase. Every couple of weeks I post a new version. So there is no live trading performance to report yet.

Please feel free to download this version and try it out on a demo account. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Hi Redbaron81,

Thank you for testing. The error that you mention means that an order that the EA sends to the broker does not match the latest price conditions that the broker wants to use. To see this error during backtesting (strategy tester) is therefore something that I can not explain.

Anyway I have given up backtesting as my experience is that backtesting usually does not match real trading anyway. For example the break-even protection is usually not simulated correctly. I only use backtesting with my early versions just to confirm that my basic algorithm works. After that I have several versions running on different demo-accounts and I analyse those results to decide what next to develop.

Anyway if you can post some details of a trade (with date and time) that gave this error I can try to simulate that status on my computer and see if I can find the reason for this error.

Cheers...

Hi Dominusbruno,

- do you get this error for every OrderSend or only now and again?

- Could you please also send a screenshot of the exact settings that you applied?

Lets for now focus on one single run and not optimisation.

And all others:

- does the strategy tester depend in any way on the broker or account type (micro, mini)?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
i get this error. On the strategy tester gives me the same error. My account is real.

Thank you nbelchior,

The error about the 3 rectangles can be ignored, but it is annoying and I will update the EA accordingly. This error does not affect the operation of the EA.

The message on the screen tells you that on a real account the EA will only work as a Trade Manager. You have to use the scripts to manually start a new trade.

On a demo account it will do auto-trading, but that functionality is still under development.

A trick you might want to use for real trading:

- setup the EA on a demo account for each pair you want to trade (i use 28 pairs).

- enable notifications in MT4 for your mobile device.

- also setup the EA on the same pairs on your real account (needs a second installation of MT4).

- every time the EA on the demo account detects a trade that it thinks is good it will send you a notification.

- manually verify that the suggested trade is indeed one you are comfortable with.

- copy the trade (when you approve it) with the scripts to your real account.

The auto trading is disabled for real accounts because the algorithm is still in a develop and test phase.

Mainly it misses some functionality to work with support & resistance lines. I am working hard to get that added to the program.

Cheers...

Thanks to those who made the originals and donated them to the world.

The bar_clock shows the remaining time until the next bar opens.

I tweaked it so it shows the time in hh:mm:ss format. Also I tuned the placement of the text a bit.

Hello jansb000.

I enjoyed this system.

How do I install EA.

Wish success.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi binhnguyenxu,

Thank you for your interest in my project. Please have a look at this website for a good explanation of how to install Expert Advisors in general.
https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex...-to-install-ea

For this EA in particular you can then look at this page:

Hi All,

I just posted a tool in another thread:

This tool can be handy for planning your next manual trade.

Hello jansb000 and congratulations for your EA. I want  to ask if you are planning on making a dashboard for this EA so that we can watch more pairs easily

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi tzic,

At this moment I have no plans for a dashboard. First I think we need absolute proof that the EA works correct. And that is not 100% true at this moment. Not every trade opportunity is correctly detected. Although when detected, the oportunities seem to be valid.

I will add a dashboard to my todo-list.

PS: I am working on a new indicator that will be helpful in this respect, but this indicator does not control the EA. It's just for us humans to more easily seer the opportunities. I will publish it here this week.

Cheers...

Delay for version 15

As some of you may have noticed, last weekend I have not released version 15. Reason is that I havent had enough time the last two weeks to check and debug its operation. I just noticed that it didn't do many trades and hence I have not much log-data to research. Therefore, I will postpone version 15 until I know why it takes so few trades. Version 16 hasn't done a single trade in the last two weeks, so something is definitly off.

PS: You can read about the upcoming release in post #1.

Cheers...

Most recent trade:

This trade was initiated manually. And I still wonder what I was thinking when I ran the BUY script.

Obviously started the trade at the worst possible moment. Anyway, with the help of MEME, the position came out today with a little profit. I am happy that my MEME implementation was able to recover from this situation. This gives me some more confidence to keep learning.

New Indicator

A while ago I was reading about MT4 memory management and indicators. As it turns out, every single indicator gets a lot of memory assigned to it, wether it uses it or not. Even if it's an indicator that simply displays the time of day or the currency pair that is being traded.

One way of dealing with this is to combine several simple indicators into one. That's exactly what I have done.

This is the changelist:
Inserted Code  * 18-02-2018 Version 1.15
* Main aim of this version is to get the 5METHOD entry working.
* - Added a description to the start dialog.
* - Bugfix: ENTRY_5METHOD, in function ntr_check() we were looking at the wrong
*   bar-offset to determine if the pricebar broke the MA5.
* - Bugfix: ENTRY_5METHOD, in function ntr_check_tdi() we were looking at the wrong
*   bar-offset to check if there was a TDI-cross or continuation signal.
* - Bugfix: Closing profitable records before the weekend does now use TimeCurrent()
*   in stead of TimeGMT().
* - Bugfix: Sometimes a bar of wrong color would still close above or below the MA5
*   and would be recognised as a valid signal. Added check that BAR has actually
*   broken MA5 and has the correct colour.
* - On demo-accounts orders for several pairs may be open at the same time. On real-
*   accounts it remains a limit of one pair that may have open orders. (one original
*   order and some meme orders if needed). The main reason for this change is to
*   generate more test-data.
* - Some small fixes to make calculations more accurate.
* - Added a structure S_POSITION_TYPE to keep critical information about a position.
*   A global variable of that type 'gPos' is used to keep that information.
* - Added method cl_srline_set.sort_set().
* - A list of SR-Lines is now read into array sr_set during OnInit().
Also, there are changes from future versions that have made teir way down to version 15:
Inserted Code  * - Do not trade pairs with redicilous spreads.
* - Changed the MA5 to MA5.2 (was 6.3). Experimental. MA6.3 works to detect a
*   change in direction on its own, but often this would not agree with the
*   crossing of the TDI. These two signals would often not align, leading to very
*   few trades. (Remember the TDI-cross must be within the first two candles after
*   a color-change.
* - Added a function cl_srline.distance() to calculate the distance between a
*   SR-Line and a given price.
* - Added a function cl_srline_set.nearest() to find the nearest SR-Line from a given
*   price. Only checks in a given direction. So it finds either the nearest SR-Line
*   in the direction where the trade is going to or in the direction where the
*   trade is coming from.

About the next version after version 16.

Like I mentioned earlier, there is a trading difference between version 15 and version "16". Version 16 has far less trades. The reason could be found by debugging, but I have decided to go for another approach.

Version 16 (as running on my system) has a number of changes, some of which are simply restructuring existing code. It appears that somewhere in this restructuring I made a mistake causing less trades. What I will do is this: I will insert a couple of versions between version 15 and version 16 to slowly introduce the changes in smaller steps.

For you my friends this makes no difference, the next version will still be named version 16, it will just be less of a change then what I had in mind. The version 16 that I have on my system will eventually come out (hopefully without bugs) as a higher version. Probably version 18. Of course this does not mean that I will stop developing. New improvements will still appear, and where possible I will implement them also in versions that are due to be released.

Cheers...

Subscribed! Thanks for the hard work, will try to use the EA tomorrow as today I was not really sure how it works.

Is only working on h4?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
1)

The EA is designed and tested on H4 and in some cases I test a trade on D1. However, technically it can work on any timeframe, but don't expect great results. The TMS strategy is well documented and well tested. It works great on higher timeframes because these timeframes have less "noise".

2)

If you know the TMS strategy its best to start trades manually with the scripts that I provided. See post #1. The EA will then take over to manage those trades.

3)

For auto trading there are still some issues. Mainly that it takes only a few trades per week.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thanks for the information, really appreciate you took your time to answer everything, this says a lot about you

It will be really helpful to have a document explaining the EA and how to enter trades and also how the EA manages that trades, I can help you with this if you want

Kind Regards,

Jaime

Hi J1mm,

I did write something earlier. Please see this post (in another thread). I wrote this before a started my own thread.
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post10126317

Although mostly still valid it is somewhat outdated, and new settings have been added and, indeed, the scripts are fully undocumented.

Your offer for help is greatly appreciated. How would we proceed to make some good documentation?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Ok, got it!

I'm setting everything up, EA is only trading the current pair that you have in your screen, right? I mean is not trading or looking for trading oportunities in other pairs that you are not watching?

I have placed 2 trades using the Script, let's see how it goes  not really good entries but want to see what the EA does

I have 3 windows open:

1- for the EA in GBPNZD pair, it says "Mode: Open Order Found"

2- for the the window where I executed the script

3- for the EA in USDCHF (Random trade) says: "Mode: Open Order Found"

I have closed the window where I executed the buy script for USDCHF, don't know if this will affect the EA or if it will manage the trade anyway

Will update once the EA close the trades.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
1)

A is only trading the current pair that you have in your screen, right?
That is correct. But see point (3) as well.

2)

I have closed the window where I executed the buy script
Once initiated, you do not need the "script-windows anymore". Once the EA has detected the the open trade it will take over control. This should be visible as immediately the EA will put on a limit order of the same tye and size as the original order.

3)

I mean is not trading or looking for trading oportunities in other pairs that you are not watching?
Every order that is opened by the EA or the scripts will be "earmarked" with a so called Magic Number. That magic number is usually unique and it is used to recognize the trades from my EA out of all other trades (manually or other ea's). (This magic number is now one of the parameters). The EA will never look to orders that do not have the correct magic number.
Now, in the process of evaluating a trade opportunity, there is one check that will look if there is any other trade open with the same magic number but for any pair. I put that in because at this moment I do not want the AUTOMATIC TRADING to open more then one trade at the same time. So, my answer is, yes the EA does look at other pairs. But not because its a nifte trading algorithm, but just to keep the open orders limited. Why? because it is possible that under certain conditions multiple pairs seem to be ready for a trade at nearly the same time (i.e. news event). All these pairs can then open meme-orders which may lead to huge drawdowns.
After months of succesful demo-trading, the above scenario actually happened in the first week I tried to trade with a (small) real account. Nearly blew the account because of the huge drawdown.
Note: For manual trading (with the scripts) you can open as many orders (of different pairs) as you like. In fact the only reason that we have to use a script is because thats the only way to get the magic number set correctly. Manual trading in MT4 has no manual option to set the Magic Number. That has to be set by means of a script or EA.
Cheers...

All clear, honestly looks very robust  I don't understand too much the MeMe concept

Sorry for the questions

If I understand correctly by your words, EA is ready to take "auto trades" already, riught? or everything has to be set using the script? If so I only would need to open X windows for all the pairs I want to "Autotrade" and setup the EA in each of them?

I just want to configure some pairs to run EA for some weeks with the default values for TP/SL and everything, just to see how it performs

NZDCHF - Still running, will end up in profits for sure.

Remarks:

1- EA is not closing Limit orders after it closes the trade, is it normal?

2- I think the TP or TrailingStop is too tight, as you can see some trades could have ended up with more profits, however better to take what market gave you and jump out for another trade.

3- When you have the trading mode enabled, all the trading comments I have never seen one saying, there you go, place sell to get your lambo, jokes aside, in fact this is very good but does all the checks that you do follow TMS Method?

Looks amathing but a bit confusing how it works, specially this MeMe thing  because if it's just opening limit order at X pips in distance, could this be too risky if price keeps moving in the oposite direction (f.e news?).

Regards,

Jimm

YES - Test on demo account!

2)

EXACTLY - But it doesnt open a lot of trades. Still needs improvent.

3)

or everything has to be set using the script?

NO - But the quality of manual trades is often better.

Just run it for a while on a demo account and you will see.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
1)

The EA should close the limit orders automatically. And that works fine on my system. Keep checking this. Remember that AutoTrade must be ON.

This code in my EA should take "orphan" pending orders out.
Inserted Code // --- Check for orphan pending orders.
if (gPos.numord == 0 && (gPos.numlim != 0 || gPos.numstp != 0)) {
string str_detail = "Orphan pending order";
close_position(isym, CR_HALF_CLOSED, str_detail);
return;
}

2)

Yes, I agree. Too many orders end in break-even. I am working on a solution.

3)

Yes its all according to the TMS 5-method as explained by Big-E. See post #1 for a link to his thread. (Big-E has died but the method is still valid and the TMS thread is still active).

4)

MEME is added later to the TMS 5-method and tested by several active TMS-traders. I agree that it feels counter-intuitive but it works when you enter a trade according to the rules of TMS. However, when it goes wrong - it goes big time. When W1 and D1 and H4 point in same direction and you enter 1st or 2nd bar after TDI-cross the MEME should hardly ever be needed. However if H4 does a retrace (but general trend is still intact) MEME (Multiple Entry Multiple Exit) will enter again at a better entry point. There will be maximum 6 orders which is more than sufficient to catch even the big retraces. To play safe: Choose order size so that 6 orders adds up to max 2% of account size.

5)

Is MEME risky?

When entering a new order according to TMS it seems to work good. Since I have the MEME software stable I have had not a single loosing order on my real account. But eventually it will happen from time to time. We just have to make sure that we make more profit then the occasional loss. In the TMS-thread you should see many examples of MEME trades. Look at this demo-trading done by Emmanuel7788. That's what I want to achieve eventually:

Change the order management - What do you think?

We often see an order starting at a moment that is good according to TMS. A potential big profit is in sight. The pip-profit goes up a bit, but then comes down a bit... and then the break-even protection takes it out. Next it returns in the direction that we anticipated initially but we are left with just $0.50 cents.

Sometimes I am happy with my 50 cents because I can see, in hindsight, that the order hasn't gone anywhere. But often I just wish the EA had left that order on without the break-even.

A possible solution could be to keep a "shadow-order". A shadow-order would be a structure in memory, never to be send to a broker. The real-order can be taken out by break-even and by an exit-event (like closing below MA5). The shadow order can only be terminated by an exit-event. Initially the shadow-order is a copy of the real-order but it is never send to the broker. It's just kept in memory so we know the exact starting condition.

As soon as the real-order is closed by break-even we still have the shadow-order. When, the trade-signal goes into our favour again (indicated by RSI-5 and possibly MA1), we re-enter with a new real-order. Hopefully this second order will have a better opening price. We keep re-opening new real-orders until the shadow-order is closed by an exit-event OR when other conditions make it unwise to reopen a new order, for example when we are near an SR-line.

In theory this could give us a really good chance for harvesting more profit. Because re-entering the market is now also possible even when the TMS conditions do not apply anymore. For example there is no crossing of the red and green on the previous bar. To make this work is another programming task, so before I start going at that I want to ask you guys if you think this could work or if it would be a waste of my time.

Example:
Attached Image

Under normal conditions the second order would have never been done by the EA:Don't like multiple trades on same BAR Entry condition for second trade might not be there Without knowing about the first trade this might look like chasing a missed opportunity I see too many cases of just the first order and missing the best part of a trade.

Hello boss,

I cannot wait for next release of the EA

1 Week taking manual trades, 25% profit which is really good, however I find that EA by himself is almost not opening trades, I don't know if I'm missing indicators of something.

Keep the good work

--- 帖子 #111 ---
continued from previous post....

What would be no-trade conditions for the re-entry order?To close to the SR-line The distance between signal and very first entry approaches ADR100. Therefore expected profit is low. We already made >50 pips on this shadow-order. There is NEWS expected shortly Market is about to close (friday) The time between first and second order is too long ... other reasons ... ??? I would like to hear from you...

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #112 ---
From my little to no knowledge about the full lists of checks and indicators the EA is using...

I would say:

- A minimum list of conditions (the most important) should be met again

- Any basic price action pattern found? Like for example engulfing showing rejection to the move that took you out?

- Entering the trade gradually? If your full lot size is 0.04, then enter half at X pips moving in the right direction again and rest of the lot after another X pips all of this lots will share same SL?

I think that the break even protection is really nice but will cause this always.

You enter a trade when all the conditions of the Strat are met, if case trade goes against you, I think you have enough protection with the MeMe system, that will try to ensure that when trade just went wrong, you will recover from the loss.

But if the trade is going well, you need it to give some space to breath, is price is comming to the entry point, maybe is just gathering some liquidity to do the next jump, and then you are cuting the wings because you think is going to reverse, but if it does, for this you have the MeMe.

Hi J1mm,

I know the autotrading does not take a lot of trades. But hey, if you can make consistent profit by entering trades manually, do we really care about auto trading?

The thing is that auto trading will never be as good as manual trading. To prevent simple errors, that humans would never make, we need check over check over check and filter nearly every opportunity except the very very best. Auto trading is just a gadget, or a holy grail. Of course I will try to get it better but the main aim is to manage manual trades.

The next release will be available soon.

Cheers...

Can you explain me what we cannot program what makes a human Trader unique, besides born intuition? I still believe we can code everythingif someone is capable of explaining it in a logical or mathematical way!

Thnxs for your time and effort !

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi madebybel,

That is an interesting question. Of course since I am trying to create an EA with autotrade capabilities it would be strange if I myself would not believe that it is possible. However, there have been several attempts to automate trading according to the TMS method, and as far as I am aware they all failed or had limited succes (or became a huge succes but kept it secret). Yet, there a human traders that trade this strategy succesfully. That in itself is not scientific proof that it cannot be done. But there is plenty of evidence that it is not simple.

I think that you are right by assuming that we can program everything that can be explained logical and/or mathematical. That is why I have chosen the TMS algorithm for my EA project. I think that this method has been sufficiently described and tested and has all the aspects in it for me to believe I can automate it.The first step is to be able to manage my trades after I manually start them. That is more or less done. But improvements will keep popping up. The second step is to get all the mechanical rules correct for automatically starting a trade. That's the process I am in now. The third step will be to add some artificial intelligence to try and predict which signal is going to be a runner and which signal is a dud. Of course my EA is made generic for all currency-pairs, and should also work with other securities with little adaptation. The fact that it has to work on many currency pairs makes it difficult to select optimal parameters since it is known that each currency-pair has its unique signature.

So, in short, a perfect trading EA might be possible but will be difficult to achieve. But that's no reason not to try. I know I will.

Cheers...

I believe that a lack of honesty and the real will to share knowledge and improve code is the main reason for not succeeding. Also the hunger for money that wants to succeed on every symbol is bad in my opinion. Of course you should never bet on one horse... but 3 is enough in my opinion. Quality before quantitiy.

I like the way you think, perhaps we should discuss further in private if you want it.

Let me put a small example about what could be a good strategy for "Re-entries"...

Let's say we have a perfect entry, then we place our Sell script...

After 1 candle Profit Protection kicks in and gets us out of the trade in a BE...

Automatically, EA could put a shadow sell order few pips from our BE when previous rejection was "engulfed" with a % of our initial lots and then re-enter again with the rest few pips after.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi madebybel,

please be aware that this is a project that is still under development. I agree with you about trading just a couple of pairs - with a stable EA. But since my EA just takes a few trades I have to run it on many pairs just to generate trades and the trade-data that comes with them. The trade data is needed to find possible bugs.

In a week there are 29 H4 candles. And one swing takes 3-8 candles on average. So for every pair that I trade I would expect at least 1 trade per week (total 28 trades). Yet the EA takes just 1 or 2 from them. I still have to figure out why.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #123 ---
This FileOpen error I will fix asap. That should not happen.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi dmlp14,

Short answer: No.

You can still select PAC entry strategy and exit strategy. And it will actually take more trades than in 5EMA mode.

I focus now on the 5EMA mode because that's the setting which takes too few trades and I suspect there is a bug that causes that.

Also note that the PAC method seems more suitable for D1 trading. I read that somewhere in the TMS thread.

Cheers...

Hi all,

it's time to release version 16!
Attached File(s)   BiM_LRSF_16.ex4

162 KB

294 downloads

Changes since the previous version:
Inserted Code  * 28-03-2018 Version 1.16
* The difference between version 15 and the original version 16 became to big. So
* I inserted this version as a copy of version 15 and only insert some of the new
* stuff from version 16 to make the transition more smooth.
* - Added a function cl_srline.distance() to calculate the distance between a
*   SR-Line and a given price.
* - Added a function cl_srline_set.nearest() to find the nearest SR-Line from a given
*   price. Only checks in a given direction. So it finds either the nearest SR-Line
*   in the direction where the trade is going to or in the direction where the
*   trade is coming from.
* - Changed the MA5 to MA5.2 (was 6.3). Experimental. MA6.3 works to detect a
*   change in direction on its own, but often this would not agree with the
*   crossing of the TDI. These two signals would often not align, leading to very
*   few trades. (Remember the TDI-cross must be within the first two candles after
*   a color-change.
* - Wait with opening a limit order until the initial order is -5 pips.
* - BugFix: The partial-close was not triggered.
* - Enhanced class cl_order:
*   o Added function: find_oldest_order()  - Find the oldest open order
*   o Added function: close_oldest_order() - Close the oldest open order
*   o Added function: delete_pending       - close all pending orders.
* - Added function: delete_all_gfxobj()  - Deletes all objects created by this ea.
* - Moved check for open orders to ntr_check_symbol().
* - Added check if file exists in cl_srline_set::readfile()
As you can see much of the changes are for smoothing out the sourcecode. Some new functions were created to make certain actions reusable or simply to move pieces of code to a place where they naturally belong. The trading algorithm is not changed so you should not see any different behaviour.Having said so, the partial close, that I have fixed now, will show you some different effect: After a certain amount of profit (in pips) the order will be partially closed. So if you have an open order of 0.02 lots it will take profit for the first halve of 0.01 and leave the other halve open. Also it will move the stoploss. Some of the new functions work with Support and Resistance lines. These functions are not yet used by the main program. That's for a future version of this EA. The partial close can be controlled by there parameters:

These parameters where there already, but now they actually work.

Hi Jansb000,

I have just stumbled on your thread whilst chasing Blamshak, I have done the setup, and the EA has executed one trade, but that being said I have the attached error, that it's sending every second.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi J1mm,

that sounds like a really interesting experiment. I never tried that (or even considered that). Remember that once an initial trade is started the EA will manage it, no matter how high the spread is. So you could use the scripts to manually start a trade and then let the EA manage it.

I would really appreciate if you would try that (on a demo account) and post the results here. This might be a new area where we can use this EA.

In the mean time I will add the maximum spread to the list of variables, but it will take a few weeks for the next version to appear.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hello boss,

I already tried this like some days ago and the script was trying to open the trade but at the end it was not opened... I will try to test it better

I PMed you with a crazy idea

Also, I'm testing some indicators in order to see if we can avoid "fake entries" to minimize the amount of MeMe trade needed.

For better view, this is how it looks on H4 timeframe.

Now, on the D1, it looks like this trade is not finished yet, but it was taken out by my TP setting.

So to test my theory about re-entering a good trade until I see an exit-event, I will go back in to see what happens.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Danapster,

what a weird problem. Can you post a screenshot of your order so I can get an impression?

What you could try is this: Maybe you can manually set the SL and TP and see if the messages stop.

I would like to hear the outcome of this test.

In version 16 most error messages will now have a line-number so I know where in the program the error occured.

Maybe you could try using that version.

Success!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi J1mm,

Please keep in mind that this EA tries to follow the "Trading Made Simple" approach. That is a well tested and documented system. Although I do appreciate your effort you have to have really convincing evidence that additional indicators will benefit this system. You might discuss your ideas in the TMS thread first. Over the past years, in that thread, they have tried a lot to improve the system, but it usually comes down to going back to basics.

However, some good adaptations have evolved, like using the PAC and the MEME system. Anyway, your testing will definitly benefit our learning process.

Cheers...

Very nice, even if you waited in H4 and you entered in the TDI Cross upwards you'd made decent pips

OK... thx for fast reply and the info on that post...! Obviously, those trades has been closed manually and not by the EA...in the meanwhile my sell CJ trades come back and perhaps I'm able to get them closed in BE or even profit as well...as below 200EMA!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
No Jdva you have the wrong end of the stick there buddy, the Ea closed these trades when they are in Profit, it is a recovery method, i would read the thread its only 8 pages long and you will understand better, Cheers.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The EA did his job, is specially designed to "Cover your back" and get you out of the trade without losing or at least, recover your trade if it goes against you...

MeMe stands for Manage Entries Manage Exits, what it does is basically place sell/buy limit orders at ATR + Spread, when trade goes against you it will trigger the limit order and then the EA will recalculate the TP to get you out of the trade in BE or with small profit.

A clear example:

First sell = -1,5€

Second sell = +4€

So even that the trade was not the best one, it ended in profit.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Successwill,

please read the pages of this thread to catch up. This EA is still under development and is not stable. One of the problems is that it does not see every opportunity. Therefore I propose to use the scripts (post #69) to start trades manually. This EA will recognise trades that are started by the scripts and will then take over. (Post #82).

As you can see in the posts from montego: Trading is still possible with an EA under development.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi jdva,

For your information: This EA trades the timeframe that is currently active on the screen.

In your screenshot I noticed something:
Attached Image

On the right, the 3 rectangles show the direction of the signal for the current timeframe, the next higher and the next-next higher timeframe. An automatic trade can only start when all three have the same color. For this mechanism to work properly, you have to make sure that you do not switch between timeframes. The chart with the EA needs a stable environment. As I noticed that two rectangles are green, while having a SELL position, I suspect that you have changed the timeframe of the chart.

The MEME mechanism is well descrbed and discussed in the TMS thread. It often saves a trade, but... there is no guarantee. If you trade against the trend then MEME might not be able to solve a huge drawdown. There is never a 100% guarantee that any order can be saved. Therefore I advise to only use the EA on a demo account and manually copy the trades only if you like them. Specially since we are still in a developing phase.

PS: Please study the trades that montego did.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks for your help...jan! I have definitely not changed the timeframe but often the settings of indis, f.i. changed colour of TDI, EMAs, or when then pipsometer disappeared ...moreover provide an unique magic number for every pair when using the script for manual trades etc.

But if I setup a trade on 15m, the ea will place the MeMe trades at 15m ATR? Or it will work with H4 data?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi J1mm,

the MEME-method is based on ADR(100), the Average Daily Range of the last 100 days. No matter what timeframe you use. The distance between a trade and the next limit-order is ADR(100)/2. This value has been discussed in the TMS thread and there is wide consensus that this is a good measure to use, no matter which security we trade.

As it turns out, with the use of ADR(100)/2 and a maximum of 6 trades per position, we can capture nearly all swings that a currency will throw at us.

Cheers...

Order versus Position

For those who are unfamilliar to trading with multiple trade setups, like MEME I would like to clarify some terminology.

We speak about a trade or order (or even a deal in MT5) when we start a single order. But in official trading terms one would say that we opened a "position".

Some trading strategies have build-in that they add or subtract to a position. This can be done in several ways. The MEME-strategy adds addtional trades to an existing position and it tries to close a position in profit. Even if within that position there may be single trades that are negative. As long as the sum of all trades within a position is positive we walk away with some profit in our pocket.

MEME stands for Multiple Entry/Multiple Exit strategy and it means that a position is gradually build, but also gradually closed. The build-up, as it is now implemented in this EA, adds to a position when that price goes against us in order to catch a better entry level. As long as the overall trend is still in place this is considered a safe action. Closing a trade is now facilitated by a partial close mechanism. In the future, specifically for MEME, this will be extended to keep the last trade in the MEME open until the RSI-5 tells us it's time to close. So that covers the multiple exit strategy.

PS: I made sure that the MEME mechanism is FIFO compliant, and therefore is suitable for USA-traders as well. (In the USA it is not allowed to use hedging on the same security and the oldest order in a position must close first. These restriction explain why many brokers do not accept USA-based traders.)

I hope this explains a bit more about MEME and why I often speak about a position instead of a trade.

Cheers...

Thaaanks a lot for the explanations, also Emmanuel was so kind to put a very nice post in TMS Thread to help get all the information from years of posting, reaaally useful...

@Jans, one quick question... The SELL/BUY Scripts (The ones with custom Magic Numbers) can both be used on same chart (Each with different Magic Number) and EA will manage them independently? I want to try something... >: )

V1.6.1 setup and ready to rock next week, I have setup a new Demo account for testing and I will keep this one for the "good" trades, Anyway I'm thinking about going life next week with this EA + Strat.

The scripts run, and are then immediately removed from the chart. So yes you can run the script on one single chart, even on the chart that holds an EA.

The EA will only "see" the trades with its own MagicNumber. Other trades, with other MagicNumbers will be completely ignored. So, you can run the EA twice for the same security, but... there can be only one single EA on a chart. So you will have to open two charts, one for the EA with MagicNumber 1 and one with MagicNumber 2.

For the others reading this: J1mm is going to perform a special experiment. This post does not apply to normal trading with this EA. Sorry for the confusion.

Just for clarification Jan: For instance I open two EU charts, first with MagicNumber "1" and a second with MN "2" and select "No Trade, Just Monitor" in the EA settings. Then I choose and put in one script MagicNumber "1" for buy and "2" for sell trades.

Now if I want to buy manually the EU...then I do apply the script with MagicNumber "1" on the EU chart with the same MN "1". Is that correct so?

Hi ManUkr,

please note that this EA is still under development:backtesting seems to be not working properly. Many ppl have reported this error during backtesting. The autotrading does not find all opportunities. I recommend trading manually and use the EA as a trade manager. When you run the EA on 28 pairs you should get a couple of trades avery week. Only use demo-account for now!! Read the thread (9 pages) to find out how it all works. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hello guys, I don't want to create too much mess on this post but I want also to inform you all

Jans, if you feel like this is just creating too much mess, feel free to tell me and I will keep it "private".

Actually this week I'm going life with the EA, manual and automatic trades, but I guess that 90% of the trades will be manual, Problem is that actually I will not be able to know what trades were initiated by me and what trades by the EA, so I will take notes about my trades. My manual trades are not perfect and I usually enter sooner than I should hoping to capture a better movement, we will see at the end of the week and compare the trades made by the EA and trades made by me.

Said this, in parallel, in demo account, I'm going to test the new approach that came to my mind, this approach consists in the following...

The EA is well coded enough to be able to get you out of a very bad trade, in small profit usually or BE, which is really nice, said so, If after I enter a Trade I see price is going against my trade, I will open another position in the opposite direction (If I did a Long I will then open a Short), In this way, even in a not favorable trade, I will still capture some profit from the trade while the MeMe Trade will eventually close in BE or small profit.

So basically I will open same normal trades in both accounts (Demo and Life) but the Demo trades will probably have extra SELL orders while the initial trade was a BUY if the trade started to go the opposite and trigger some MeMe orders and viceversa. In this way I will compare the profits for a week (I know is very short time for this test, but well, I will keep this forward test for some time more if a week is successful).

Interesting project, mate..being curious how it will do. Don't forget to change the max spread in the new EA, 10 (points) should be too little for most currencies...

has anyone tested this with the original entry method (i.e. TDI/ Sto) ? - i noticed it defaults to break of 5MA as entry.

would be interesting to see how  TDI/Sto  and compared with default of 5MA

Ah, you have not seen the change-list that came with version 16.

Limit orders will now be postponed until the profit drops below -5 pips.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Officially live-trading is not supported. When I switch it ON it will allow just ONE open position. That is all to protect you and me against disasters.

Version 15 has "a bug" in that it didn't detect that it was not on a demo account.

Please use version 16 on a demo account and only copy the trades that you think are good.

I am sorry for the inconvenience, but I have learned the hard way that this is the way to go.

Remember that there are still bugs in the program, and with me trying to solve them I can not guarantee that I do not introduce new bugs. So every version needs some time in the demo world before I trust them with real money.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I see! I just answered you by PM about the bug in V15 allowing you to open multiple positions in Life

I'm actually trading manually by using the script, so I will keep V15 for Life and V16 for Demo, I need to so some testings on V16 because I think is not able to open BUY SELL Orders at same time even using different Magic Numbers and the Script specifying the Magic Number... Anyway I will test it further today.

Kind Regards,

Protections and safe-guards in the LRSF TMS EA.

I included several security mechanisms in the EA. To protect you and me against bad trades and abuse of the program.

The list below applies to the automatic trading feature. Manual trading and using the EA as trade manager is not restricted:In principle I do not like to use the autotrader to work on a live real account. So I have set it default to only work on a demo account. Bugs from the past and future can quickly demolish an account. So an EA needs to be tested for many months on many markets by many people before it can be trusted with real money.

Once I feel confident with my EA I will lift this restriction. In a different part of the program, I have coded a limit so that on a real account just one single open position is allowed. That position must be closed before a new position can open. In case the EA produces bad trades it will sink your ship slowly. The following limitation are equal for demo and real trading.No multiple trades on same bar. In the past I had a problem with trades that would keep opening after I or the BE-protection closed them. I call this oscillating trades. This would eventually lead to a trade that can not go profitable. Now I simply check the closing time of the last trade of the current pair and refuse a new trade for a couple of hours on that same pair. There is a time limit of 3 months on every version. This is to make sure that everyone uses a recent version of the program, with less bugs. This is also needed for myself because my project contains a lot of include files and I can not keep older versions up to date with newer include files. At some point I have to drop support for older versions. I support 4 versions of the trader, the last stable one, the latest released one, the one that I am testing for release and the future version. (At this point in time thats version 15, 16, 17 and 18).

The 3 months is plenty of time for a newer version to appear.

Hello guys!

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Yes I have the trade on my demo with version 16.

Monday I started 4 trades manually, all 4 needed MEME. Pfff. Anyway 2 came out with profit today. Now waiting to see what the other two will do.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Same here, I have it on Demo and took it manually on live...

Lets see how this end up, Im having MeMe also for a couple of trades that I took not really following TMS rules so lets hope hope the best hahaha...

Im afraid the day we hit a 6 step MeMe loss X_X no wins can recover from that xD

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Agreed Jamie, but i still would be in proift as the Ea has done me proud so far, You cant win all the time in Forex

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Yep, once in a while will will take a hit. The thing is that the normal trades, eventually when all bugs are solved, should make more profit then the occasional loss. The way the EA is operating now we get way to many break-evens, or good orders are taken out with TP early. The EA needs to take full advantage of the good trades:Add to winning trades

When a trade goes our way we have to add to it at every retrace. Currently the TP is to close to let that happen.

Before we can do this...we need info about SR-Lines (wip) shadow orders (wip)
Trade until next SR-Line is reached

Before we can do this...we need info about SR-Lines (wip) Re-enter trades after BE shadow orders (wip)  So, still a lot of work to do.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Jans agreed, but to add to this i still think this is the most profitable and safe Ea i have ever used, thanks again for all your hard work..

version 15 over 2 weeks notice no red colums - 477 pips !

Please read post #180.

Hi all,

as of version 17 there will be initial support for handling Support & Resistance lines (SR-Lines). Support & Resistance lines are often regarded as crucial to place new trades correctly. In version 17 the available SR-Lines will be read from a file and shown on the chart. They will not yet be used for making trade-desicions in version 17.

In post #1 you can find a link to a tool to store SR-Lines in a local database. With that tool you can draw SR-Lines and store them in a file. Later this file can be used to put the SR-Lines back on the chart. The EA can read this file as well!

When version 17 will be released I will also publish a copy of my file with SR-Lines. Fortunately, SR-Lines tend to stay stable for a long time.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #218 ---
About using SR-Lines.

The price often bounces between support and resistance lines. Therefore, when we approach a SR-line we can expect that the price will react to it. Either by bouncing back or by breaking. What I want to accomplish with the EA supporting SR-lines is that I want to avoid trades near an SR-line.
Attached Image

As an example: In the picture you can see two possible trades.Trade A trades away from the upper SR-line and has plenty of space before it reaches the lower SR-line. That is good, we can make $$$ here. Trade B trades into the lower SR-line. That is not good, there is a 50% chance that the price will bounce. There is hardly any room to make money. The B-trades are dangerous since these are the trades where we can see a change of trend, and a big trend can be so big that MEME cannot save it anymore. Therefore we want to avoid those B-trades.

In the picture above one could also ask, what about the signals given by the green bars? They also trade away from the lower SR-line, but they never seem to go far. That is true, and that is why we also have to check the trends on the higher timeframes. We only take trades in the direction of the trends on the higher timeframes. When we stick to the existing algorithm but just remove the dangerous B-trades the chances of a big loosing trade will be reduces significantly (i.m.o.).

Some trading assumptions:Working with trends and SR-lines is more reliable on higher timeframes. That is why TMS is working with H4 and higher. Also the swings between SR-lines on the higher timeframes are bigger, so we should be able to get more pips per trade
For some reason, the prices will almost always move from one SR-line to the next. So if we can grab a trade that is close to, but away from a nearby SR-line we have a fair chance of making some decent profit. Since we now have a way to avoid B-trades (and therefore also reduce the risk of long running MEME orders), that means the EA will be "free" to jump on the next A-trade.
When we are already in a good trade and we approach a SR-line we stay in the trade. A trade will only be exited once we get an exit-event according to TMS. For example, if we took trade A, we would stay in that trade (locking the break-even level). The price might break the lower SR-line and give us more profit. Remember that we are always trading with the bigger trends.
We assume that we can still make profit when we are approx. 30 pips away from an SR-line.

(or ADR(100)/2). Any closer than that means we will wait for another trade. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Oops.

I realised I made a mistake in the Magnified price indicator. I used the TMS MA5 with offset 2 to determine the signal-direction, but that is wrong. It should have been MA10. So here is a quick update:Uses MA10 to determine direction of the signal The number of periods is now a parameter Added version number (1.11) to better keep track of the last updated version.

Hi traders,

One of the issues with the EA is that it doesn't take a lot of trades. It seems to miss some good signals.

I have only so much time to monitor all pairs besides work etc. and I desperately need more data to find what is wrong.

Therefore, I want to ask you guys to post cases where you would have expected the EA to take a trade (according to TMS). And I will try to investigate why the EA decided not to trade. Maybe with the extra input (and hence more data) I can find the reason for this issue faster.

PS: Maybe it turns out that the EA works just fine and there really are less signals than I assume.

The EA is intended for H4 and D1 trading. I do all my testing on H4.

This is the bottom few lines of the EA code. Its now more then 3300 lines in the main file. I think I have the same amount in all the include files so we are close to 6000 lines of code in total! And still so many things to add .

Jans, I think would be a nice idea to rework the MeMe approach a little bit.

Today I got a hit in a Live account, nothing to blame the EA, was the worst trade possible (NZDUSD) but when you get hit, you can easily blow up 1 month of trading.

Hi all,

Dear jansb000 ,

First of all , many thanks for the EA and posting on this nice forum.

Subscribed and downloaded the EA .

Seems the EA is indeed missing some good trades following the TMS strategy . for example

today at 10:00 EUR/USD 4 H , Green tdi crosses Red at 1.220...long

today at 06:00 GBP/USD 4 H , Green tdi crosses Red at 1.39262...long

today at 14:00 USD/JPY 4 H , Green tdi crosses Red at 108.884...short

Thanks again for the hard work m8,

Will try to help with the cases you need to test the EA .

Sorry in advance if those cases above are not the correct ones.

Regards

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Sorry to hear that you had a bad trade. I hope you can recover the losses.

I will make the use of MEME optional in version 17. Also I will make the max number of MEME trades a parameter so you can set it to your own liking.

Also I published the new version of the LRSF indicator with trend-indication to help selecting the best trades. And, the upcoming support of SR-lines will help to prevent bad trades.

I had a MEME meltdown myself with GBPUSD. And of course it seems to turn back up now. This was a trade I took manually and it was one of those where you ask yourself, what was I thinking!!. Anyway, this trade would have never been taken by the EA so this was just me, myself and I.

Maybe, we need to go back to demo-trading until we have at least 3 months proof of good trades.

Chhers...

--- 帖子 #230 ---
That was because of my greed, I saw sign of exhaustion (quite difficult to identify with HA candles if you ask me) and then came in too early.

No matter about the amount of MeMe trades, I had a margin call ( I started with small account )

Sooo... Well, as I said nothing to blame the EA, but I would say we can improve the logic of MeMe trades to not put orders just blindly and maybe just when Price has some signals of reverse (at least some)

If you check the NZDUSD it went straiiiiight down, not even a signal of going back up, so don't know, maybe we can think about how we can take profit from this situation

Kind Regards,

Jimm

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Maybe in the new version quth SR support, we can identify strong SR and SupplyDemand zones and place there the MeMe orders, don't know

--- 帖子 #232 ---
That is an excellent idea...

It will take some recoding here and there so it will take a bit of time to get this in the codebase. But I will definitely do that!!!!

I had a similar idea about the TP level. After TP-pips is reached leave the trade running until we see a turn of the price.

Cheers....

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi Bud i get what your saying, but Meme is all ways going to be a risk, but we all know its better than the alternative (Martingale) that will blow the account, my take on it is if your account is big enough most times MeMe will recover it, but nothing is 100% what i would advise is to monitor it and if you think it has no chance close the trades manually so you have more control over it, if you think about it if you were trading MeMe Manually if you got to the third trade and thought i dont like the look of this you would close it, your point about the S and R is a Really good one Cheers.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Yeah, but the fact is that once you start "MeMe" you are just relying on a hope that price has to reverse at some point, I mean, there is no edge at all as you already lost the trade so we are just betting blindly on a losing horse like this case, dumb trade (I don't know what I thought at this point and I deserve that hit) but at the end, there is no point to keep opening buy orders when price did the first "reverse" or green bar I already had like 3 open MeMe orders which could have been reduced to maybe 1 MeMe or even only the initial BUY...

Said that, maybe as I said, placing the MeMe order in some "important level" or when price show signs of going back up (Maybe stochastic leaving OS/OB area) or even MBFX_Timing, that I found it more accurate than Stochastic. So in this case we are not stacking orders at a fixed pips which will increase the loss exponentially, we are only stacking orders in key areas where price is likely to at least pullback and then we enter if also we have confirmation that is indeed reversing... Maybe even increasing the initial lot by a % to reduce the "pullback" size to end up in break even... Don't know, there is plenty to explore there hehehe.

Kind Regards,

Jimm

Is it possible that Monday with 28 pairs has not opened any trade? I attach images by siye observe irregularity in the comments indicated by the EA on the screen.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Yes I thought the same. Because of that I should try to reinstall the EA on H1 and soon after that it opened one trade AUDJPY.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
In regard to open MeMe trades we can consider to open near trendline as price tend to react often there.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
EA is trading always the 4h from what I understood, I think not matters the TF you have setup?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I don't know but it opened a trade soon after I changed TF.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Noooo.... it trades the TF that is currently active on the chart. So, if you have a chart on H1 then the EA will look for signals on the H1 TF (and confirmation in the higher timeframes H4 and D1). It's just that I always test the EA on H4 as that is the TF that was originally used in the TMS thread.

But the original poster from that thread (BigE) also used H1 sometimes (and even lower) to find better entry points. Specially between London Opening and New York Opening he often used H1 for his entries.

To calculate the distance for TP, SL and MEME it uses the fixed ADR(100) and that is always based on D1.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Oops... Got this! Haha

I will setup new indicators and everything tomorrow, seems that EURUSD was not a really good trade at the end! We are in the last MeMe trade! Haha

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi all,

I think I found the bug that caused the EA to take so few trades. For those that want to go all technical:I used a generic MA (EMA-10) to get a general idea about the direction the price was going. the TMS uses a MA (EMA-5.2) to decide when the price changes direction, but when this happens we have to jump in the trade in the first- or second bar. Now by the time the slower EMA-10 would indicate the new direction we often would have been past the first 2 bars as seen by the EMA-5.2. And when they do not agree -> no trade. I fiddled with version 16 to test this out and found a solution. The EA now produces more signals. I decided to publish this new version 16 along with a heap of other improvements as version 17. Will publish that version later today.

Cheers...

Hi All,

the number of changes is pretty big. So this release is not so much the next milestone, but more the necessity to stop adding more changes and create a stable version before I can continue .

This is the changelist part 1 (improvements):
Inserted Code  * 10-04-2018 Version 1.17
* The main aim of this version is to separate all the trade-checks that have to do
* with the TMS algorithm from the checks that have to do with other stuff.
* - Parameter MonitorOnly replaced by TradeMode. Added two new modes ONLY_SELL and
*   ONLY_BUY. This enables the EA to specifically search for trades of the given
*   type.
* - Added parameter SpreadLimit. This was requested by some of the thread-readers
*   to make it possible to set the spread higher to trade GOLD and GER30.
* - Bugfix: do_open() would always fail because the new trading modes ONLY_BUY and
*   ONLY_SELL where not detected properly.
* - ntr_check() now aborts when sigdir(tf_nxt) is not conclusive (performance).
* - Added functions draw_srlines(), DrawHLine().
* - Deleted function DrawEllipse().
* - Bugfix: delete_all_gfxobj() sometimes did not delete all objects.
* - Enhanced error messages so they will show location of error.
* - Relocated the calculation of profit-pips in do_manage() to be near the top.
* - Added variable SRLineColor.
* - Moved check for spread to ntr_check_symbol().
* - Moved check for drawdown to ntr_check_generic() (but its not active yet).
* - Moved check for bar-timing to ntr_check_symbol() (but its not active yet).

This is the changelist part 2 (developments):
Inserted Code  * - Added the opening of a shadow-order to do_open(); We call it the v_order.
* - Closing position now uses find_oldest_order() and delete_pending(). We now
*   support the USA-rule to close oldest order first. And code is simpler.
* - Bugfix: The profit was sometimes reported wrong in notifications. Reason: It
*   would report the profit from a random single order out of the position. Now
*   the SUM of all orders in a position is reported.
* - Bugfix: The problem with the low number of trades per week seems to be solved.
*   Reason: the signal direction was determined with a MA10 but TMS is based on
*   MA5. By the time the sigdir was settled the best entrypoint for TMS was already
*   past. This was a design flaw that was coded correctly!
* - Renamed the include with string-functions to <inc_string_functions.mqh>.
* - Collected timeframe-functions in a new include <inc_tframe_functions.mqh>.
* - Added function trigger4tframe() to <inc_tframe_functions.mqh>.

For the record, if this EA does not support back-testing it becomes immensely more difficult to test settings and more time consuming. I would recommend trying to implement if it is non-functional. I don't see a reason for why it would not work on my broker. Stop levels seem okay etc.

Thank you for your hard work. It feels like an open source program always a nice bonus.

This video describes exactly that method:
Inserted Video

My previous project for making a trading program implemented that method, and I called it "Bandwidth Trading [BWT]".

This method works in theory, but in practice has a couple of weaknesses. First of all, it does work. Eventually your trade always comes out and its with break-even or (as I implemented it) with a little profit. However, in ranging markets the edges of the bandwith (or recovery area) keep getting hit and every time you have to increase the lotsize by a small factor (usually 1.4). This will eventually lead to huge positions (buys and sells) and you need a sizable account to be able to handle that. Also, when the market decides to range it can take weeks before your position makes it to the break-even level.

Don't get me wrong, in a healthy market the method works. In my own implementation my order-entry was not very good, but the order management was ace. However, because of the bad entries, nearly every trade ended up in a position where it would end up in a state between the two recovery lines. Now note that as soon as a second order is opened (one buy and one sell) your trade must go all the way to the 200 pip line to come out in break-even.

In fact my experiences with that program led me to search for a different strategy for entering the market. That's how I found the TMS strategy. And that's how we ended up here.

Now, with the TMS the order entry is a lot better (in the sense that most orders go at least in the right direction) so I have been pondering if at some point in the future I should combine the order-entry from TMS with the order management of my BWT strategy. But that would be a whole project on its own. For the time being I want to explore how far I can take the TMS system. And then (many moons from now) I will decide if a combination of the two techniques seems like a good investment of my time.

The year of the US presidential election and the brexit referendum was the year where the BWT method broke down because the market volatility was a lot less, and open positions became bigger and bigger without ever reaching the needed 200 pips. That's when I decided to stop using BWT and the use of hedges positions as much as possible.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Yeah exactly that, good to know that you already tried it

Exactly my thoughts, I think that we have quite a good entry point where the momentum is in our favour, and when trade goes against us it goes big as well. Creator uses 0,1 lot size, which indeed, can end up in huge positions if you start bouncing like crazy, my initial idea is to use micro lots to start.

EA could also have some kind of DD protection, that when reached, EA will start looking for a quick exit taking an acceptable loss preventing us to get stopped out.

Also as you explained, next implementations will have also control over S&R (I would suggest to look for Supply and Demand zones istead) where price tends to break hard or bounce hard, but not usually range there for too much time. The example of the video shows 50 pips and 200 pips TP, maybe playing with lower values could be interesting...

As you said, its just a matter of time and effort, sad that I don't have idea about coding an EA... I wish I could help you.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
In my implementation I had the gap-width as a parameter. I started with 50 pips, but tested with 30 pips, 70 pips and finaly found that 100 pips works best. You need to give the price some space to breathe before opening a hedge order, otherwise you will get flooded with buys and sells. The guy from the video runs a company where they do this trading for investors and they use 200 pips as a gap before an opposite order is opened (I think he says that near the end of the video, but there are other video's with him as well). So even with that method it is important to get your entry right.

BTW: Hedging is not allowed anymore in the USA. Also, many brokers do not support hedging with MetaTrader5 (until recently MT5 didn't even have an option to hedge). The EU is looking into trading of leveraged contracts like Forex. They may look into hedging as well. This should all become clear by the end of this year. So developing a hedge-based trader might not be a good idea until more information is made available.

Hi all,

Today it's time for an update of the LRSF-Indicator:

You may notice that the indicator is now drawing a little rectangle:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is a first implementation of a Weekly Control Candle as described here:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post10472907

It comes down to that we can use the high and low from the previous week to decide if we want to trade BUY or SELL.

This is just a visual aid. It is up to you to decide if you want to use it. The EA is not using it at the moment, but since there has been a lot of posting about WCC recently on the TMS thread I decided to include it in the indicator.

Other changes to the indicator: The trend indicators (***) are now in sync with the 3 rectangles that the EA shows on the screen

Cheers...

Hi kofix11,

I was fiddling with this today. Actually I use the start/ and end time of the weekly candles. So there is no GMT or local time involved.
https://docs.mql4.com/series/itime

Similar to this:
Inserted Code int      lv_daysec = PeriodSeconds(PERIOD_D1);
datetime lv_dt_lo  = iTime(_Symbol, PERIOD_W1, idx) + lv_daysec;
datetime lv_dt_hi  = lv_dt_lo + (7 * lv_daysec);
Anyway, I am working on it.

You may find the "Work In Progress" in post #1.

Hello boss,

Pretty decent trade on AUDUSD that the EA didn't took

Attached Image

What do you think? is it correct that EA didn't took this one?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
According to TMS rules, this looks like a valid entry condition. So, yes, you could be correct. I will investigate this later in greater detail.

However... As a manual trader I would not take this SELL trade:it appears to me that we have "divergence". TDI and STO are making higher highs. The price is making lower lows. Price is now hugging a support line. We have to wait for bounce-up or break-through. Price has not broken last weeks low (See box that latest Mgnified Price 1.14 draws). So, although the TMS conditions seem to be ok, its is still good that it didn't take the trade (which happened here pure coincidently.

Yes that is correct. I would have expected a signal from the EA.

The lack of signals from the EA is starting to annoy me. So I am going to add status info to the EA.

It will work as follows:When you see a setup that you think should be detected by the EA you can press a special key, Say 'D'. A popup will appear "Do you want to save EA-Status Y/N". If you answer that with Yes a file will be stored with all the trading data that the EA has collected at that moment. Its going to be a human readable text-file so you can always check what is stored. You can then decide if you want to share (parts of) that data for debugging purposes. That should give us an answer why a trade is not detected. I plan to have this available in version 18.

Does that sound like a good plan?

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks jansb000 to insert swaps. Great!

Version 18: First example with writing a TradeStatus to a file.

First is that you must enter Shift-D:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Next you can find the file in your Files folder from the MT4 program:
Attached Image

With this feature it is easy possible to record what the EA is doing. This info can later be studied and discussed in this thread.

I am going to test this for a couple of days and then I will probably add it to version 17 as well and make it available for everyone.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi all,

in post #1 (near the bottom) you will find version 1.17.1.

It has a couple of fixes:It has support for storing the TradeStatus. Simply press Shift-D on the chart and the EA will offer to store the current status to the Files folder of MT4. The TradeStatus consists of a text-file and a screenshot. This makes it easy to store data for debugging or about the system status when you manually took a trade. There was an important bug regarding a check of the RSI on low timeframes. I found this one while preparing an algorithm for re-entering trades that came out at break-even. This will be a feature for version 18, but solving the RSI bug is also important in earlier versions. As usual, try this new "Work in Progress" version on a demo account only!!!

Cheers...

I had the same (running version 16). Was a bit disappointing because after solving the bug with the MA-10 I expected more. Now I solved another bug in the RSI detection (that also has an effect on the number of trades) so maybe version 1.17.1 will be the solution. Lets wait and see. Looking forward to this week.

According to Jansb's strategy, he needs confirmation from next higher and next-next higher TF. But I'm not sure which one he is using for... Is it MA5, HA candle or TDI,...? It would be better if he could share the strategy here

Regards,

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Pervis is right. The trends on all three timeframes must be alligned. (And it is the EMA5 that I am checking on all timeframes).
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In this case the trends (indicated by the 3 stars) are not all the same color and therefore we get no trade.
Attached Image

In this case the EA expects that the current buy signal is just a little retrace and it wants to wait for the next move down.

Question: Do we really want the next AND next-next higher timeframe to be aligned or just the next. In other words when we trade the H4 do we just check the D1 or do we check the D1 AND the W1 before we dare to take the trade.

I am starting to think that maybe I should drop the demand for the next-next timeframe. (Or make that cholice a parameter).

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi Pervis,

my goal is to implement the Trading Made Simple strategy. In post #1 you will find a link to it. I think there is no need to describe it here as it is a well established and documented strategy. The problem is that my EA does not seem to take all the opportunities that we humans see. That is a flaw in the program that I still have not found. I am working on it.

For the time being we can take trades manually with the scripts that I provided (see post  #1). The EA will then function as a trade manager.

Also, in the parameters, you could choose the PAC entry method. That will take a lot more trading opportunities.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Weekly trend is maybe too excesive I would say checking D1 should be enough... Maybe and I say maybe, even checking 1H trend to be sure but maybe this is just dumb and always would be the same as the H4 in our entry...

Could you share what Broker you usage for test ?

because I find some Broker can't open trade for this ea.  thanks

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Dear Jansb,

6 months ago, I stumbled to TMS thread and become fan of that strategy. I worked hard, read hundred of pages, completely understood the strategy and started manually on demo account with 60% success.  After lot of hard work, I came to know that maybe this strategy was working before but now it caught the eyes of brokers or whatever because most of crosses / signals even on 4H time frame were fake.

Then I started searching on FF for TMS experts and found some EA's and tools (dash boards) based on this TMS idea. There are many threads with same aim as yours to make an EA to copy trading style and strategy of Big E and some are really working same like Big E's trading style. I don't know if this is discussed earlier in this thread or not (my apology for this), and also I have not yet tested your EA completely (again my apology for this) however I am continuously following your thread.

If you don't mind, I just want to share here, Only if you allow me, link to an EA and a Dash Board thread which are 100% based on TMS. I believe, you must know about this, in case it may helpful for all of us here.

Not right now (well the opening price in the order was not accepted by the broker). But the reason is not clear yet. Could be that the price moved very fast which happens now and again.

How an EA sends orders to a broker

Lately we have seen several posters in this thread that mentioned errors in the log from the EA. It might therefore be interesting to learn a bit more on how orders are send from an EA to the broker.

There is a standard programming statement specially for sending orders to the broker. Unsurprisingly it is named "OrderSend". It means that somewhere in de code of my Expert Advisor this statement must appear and it needs parameters to define the specifics of the order to open.

This is how it should be used:
Attached Image

This is how to fill those parameters:symbol

This is simply the currency pair that you want to trade. It could be "EURUSD" but more interesting names are also possible, like "EURUSDmicro". The exact names of the currency pairs depend on how your broker has specified them. So it can differ per broker. Lucky for us there is also a programming statement to find the name of the pair that is currently on the chart with the EA attached. Example:

[code]string lv_sym = _Symbol;

int lv_ticket = OrderSend(lv_sym, ...[/code]

Although this seems simple enough, it might give you a clue what it means to trade different currency pairs then the one on the current chart .

. cmd

Here we specify what kind of trade we want to do: a buy or a sell. It is also possible to specify a pending order types like LIMIT and STOP orders.

. volume

Here we specify the size of the order that we want to send to the broker. The minimum size is 0.01.

. price / slippage

We also must specify the current price that we expect to pay for the order. This makes a lot of sense of pending orders ("I want to BUY when the price reaches this level"). However the price must also be filled for orders that must be executed immediately. It is however for our own security to prevent nasty surprises in case the currency pair makes a sudden move. This also means that when the market price is not near the price that you mention here the order will fail. The deviation between the specified price and the market price is called slippage. As long as the market price is within the range price +/- slippage the order should be executed. But it is normal that sometimes an order will fail because of this constraint.

. stoploss / takeprofit

These are the prices where we want the stop-loss and take-profit levels.

. comment

A line of text that you can add to an order.

. magic

Every order has a "secret" code. This code can only be seen by expert advisors and other scripts. This magic number is used so the EA can recognise its own orders and tell them apart from orders that originate from other expert advisors. When you enter a manual order it will always get the magic number 0. Therefore, if you want your manual orders to be managed by an EA you must use a script that will add the correct magic number.

. expiration

This is a date-time that indicates how long a pending order remains valid. In many cases you want a pending order to be valid for only a limited amount of time. If this field is filled with '0' the pending order will remain valid indefinitly (until you delete it).

. arrow_color

Here you can set the color of the little arrow that appears on the chart when an order is opened. In LRSF we use blue for BUY orders and red for SELL orders. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Errors while sending orders to a broker

In continuation of the previous post...

When one of the parameters is not clear to the broker the order will not be executed. Furthermore, during the execution something might go wrong and the execution must be aborted.

Common errors are:the price/slippage can not be used.

Occasionally this can happen, but if it happens a lot I would wonder why my broker does not accept orders with a price that he himself just send to me.

(all orders are send with the current Bid or Ask price). Yet, even with a fairly large slippage, this error seems to pop up regularly with some brokers.

. the take-profit or stop-loss are to close to the current price.

All orders in LRSF are initially set without SL and TP. After the order has been succesfully placed the order will be modified and a suitable SL and TP will be added. This is the way that is mandatory for ECN accounts, but works also for all other account-types. Most brokers use a so called stop-level, which means that a SL and TP must be a minimum distance from the current market price. LRSF takes this into account and also corrects for the spread that might increase this stoplevel by a few pips.

Occasionally we might see an error when the market is moving fast but in general we should never see an order without SL and TP.

. Other operational reasons

Sometimes the number of orders send to the broker is to much and the broker has to reject certain order requests. This problem might also occur on your own system as background processing leaves no room for the order to be send. In order to deal with errors, LRSF has a special procedure called 'XOrderSend'. This procedure calls OrderSend and checks for errors. If the error can be solved by retrying the send process then XOrderSend will do this. XOrderSend will try to resend an order 11 times before it gives up.

Cheers....

Hi all,

In post #1 (near the bottom) I released a new WIP version of the Magnified Price 1.15.1.

Note: Its very basic so far, but may be fun to test it. Don't use it for trading yet until version 1.15 gets released (not the WIP version).

PS: The relevant PA patterns are all named in the TMS thread. Its Shooting Star, Hammer, BUOB, BEOB, BUEB, BEEB.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi lddd,

If you read this thread you will find all your answers.

In short:This expert is still under development and as such not yet released for live trading. Only demo trading is allowed.

There is a workaround by using the scripts. Read Post #1 to find them. Most settings are explained in posts in the thread. Its just 15 pages so should not take long to locate.

PS: Any volunteers to write a short user manual (mainly describing all the settings in one document)? The LRSF Magnified Price is a collection of free indicators combined in one indicator. Its not needed for the Expert Advisor.

If you go through the thread you will find explanation with pictures. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hey. Thanks for your kind words.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
By the way

1) Can you (or maybe some other trader using this EA) provide me with some stats/results from a demo account? Maybe someone running this on a VPS or for at least 1 or 2 moth / having it linked to MyFxBook or so. I would be highly interested in its profitability so far.

2) I know development of EAs takes time and nobody wants to release software not stable for production. But do you have any time in mind where you might want to lift the limitation about demo/live accounts trading. Or else said, how far this expert is away from being "trusted" for long-term oriented real account trading?

Otherwise really great work so far! I will looking forward to set up a demo account my self the next days and attach this system to it. I will keep you updated with the results.

I really love the TDI and TMS strategy and convinced about it. However i really having a hard time with it (trading it manually) Especially finding the right entry setups on time, taking proper stop loss levels and take profit targets. As i first came to the TMS i really thought it would be a beginner friendly strategy where you don't have to follow up with so much extra noise, multiple indicators and market conditions but more and more had to admit its far more then having a TDI Green/red cross and maybe one more extra confirmation to it.

The more I read about the different strategies here about the TDI the more complicated it seems to find valid entry signals without having to draw a dozens trend lines + watching multiple time frames at same time before coming to any trading decision taking a possible entry point or better skipping it.

For me still every entry condition looks different to me. In most cases i am missing the good signals while over analyzing or entering in the bad ones where market condition is crap at all or its running into any SR areas where no room is left.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Iddd,I publish new versions regularly so there is no point running it on a VPS as the results are outdated immediatly. The thing is further that this EA is actually more a trade manager. Most traders that use it place trades manually and then use this EA to manage those trades. The automatic trading part is there but it is still very buggy and it doesn't take many trades per week.

. The Trade Manager part is quite good and also works on real accounts. Its just the automatic trading part that is limited to demo accounts. Unfortunately, you will still need to learn the TMS trading strategy. Make sure you understand what MEME is and what risk it poses on your account. This is essential knowledge.

. TMS is not an easy strategy and the first posts in the thread are a bit deceptive. I recognise the learning curve from what you describe. I have been there myself. On the other hand, after a couple of years I kinda managed to learn it. Now putting it into a working EA is another challenge.

. A trade manager lets you start the trade (using scripts) and will then take over trying to make the trade profitable. The better you get at choosing your initial trade the higher your profit will go.

. I have no plan when the automatic trading feature will be ready.

Most EA's on FF are published here AFTER development. I decided to start publishing versions right from the start so those interested could get an idea off how developing an EA works. See post #287 and contact that poster to get info about currently available alternative TMS Expert Advisors. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #300 ---
What does MEME stands for? Never heard of it.

Okay understand. So this EA is not original designed to open trades. Damn :-) I already thought i did find my holy grail, hah.

Do you know if there are any productional fully automated trading approaches based on the Traders Dynamic Index?

I see one main problem you have its not triggering enough trades? Whats wrong with that? I am far away from being a professional trader but i always thought its not about taking as many trades as possible but more like try catching the most likely winning ones.

I mean how much trades are needed? You don't need to make a dozens of pips each week to make a nice return if you not trading a cent account. So i think even if its just doing 5 Trades a month where 3 are winners its already enough...

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Multiple Entry Multiple Exit

MEME is a technique to save your trade when the price goes against you temporarily.

Look at this example:
Attached Image

I went in at completely the wrong moment with a BUY. The market then decided it was time for a retrace (temporarily going against me). However the main trend remained intact. Now instead of having your order run into a stoploss, we actually add another trade (because we believe the original trend is still intact).

In the example you can see that the EA eventually had to add 3 additional orders. The effect of this is that my very first order doesn't have to make profit. As long as the average of the whole lot is positive I can still come out with a profit.

Please read post #106 en #107 for some more explanation.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Doesn´t make a lot of sense to me right now. So what if it´s not just a temp. retracement and price completely turning against you? So you place even more buy orders just to recover 1 original trade setup because you can´t accept a small loss (having it hit your stop loss)?

Thats also a good reason why i am not a fan of stop loss trading at all. I normally never place any stop loss orders if i am able to watch a trade at least once a day. (doesn´t mean i do not have some hard limit in mind, but i would normally not want to place it per software). I mean trading 4H or even daily you won´t have your trades opened for weeks normally or? So why placing stop losses at all here?

Its also a good example of why a trade manager like this doesn´t seems to make a lot of advantages to me here? If you trade the 4H or even daily it should not be so hard to watch once a day or once every 4 hours what your trade is doing.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
You are right, a couple of good trades per month is all we need.

The problem is not so much a trading issue but more a programming issue. I wrote this EA to react to certain entry-conditions. Now if we see a chart where all the entry-conditions appear to be there but the EA did not take the trade... I get nervous. Did I make a mistake in my software (a bug)? Or was there indeed a reason not to take the trade (not easy visible on the chart)? And if so, is the EA maybe too strict in choosing its entries? I am still struggeling to find the definite answer to this.

Eventually i will solve this however. But as long as there is a risk of a bug we must be very careful with using this EA on a real account.

To be able to analyse every situation where we expected the EA to take a trade I need data to analyse. As much as possible. So I ask everyone using this EA to post examples of trades that they think the EA should have taken. This should speed up the proces. I have to catch the EA exactly on a moment in time where it is making its decision. And then we (the readers of this thread) must discuss if this is indeed a missed entry or a good decision by the EA.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #304 ---
100% agree. Of course thats a problem. But thats something I would personally not take to seriously.

If the EA is missing some trades but finding the ones it should find (your programmed rule set for an entry) that sounds already good to me. I would be more worried if trades are opened unexpected (not described by any programmed entry rule set) or the software not performing at all, crashing suddenly closing running trades without any reason or something like that.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Iddd,

this is all very true. Let me reply with the goal of this project: To automate the trading process as described in the Trading Made Simple thread. I didn't invent this strategy, but it seems to work and it is well documented. MEME is a part of it and a number of traders have good results with it. All discussions about if it is wise to use or not I would like to leave in that thread.

What I have learned is this: When the price goes against you, you have to come out of the trade. When you did a good trade, but entered too early, the MEME-strategy will find a better entry-point. The EA has parameters to control MEME. You can switch it off, or limit it to a certain maximum amount of trades. In that sence it turns out that it is very difficult to create a 100% automatic trader. There will always be the need for a good trader to operate the EA. It just automates some of the tasks to make the job a bit easier.

Cheers...

From a programmers viewpoint: Everything that is unexpected needs to be explained or solved. There is no guarantee that a bug that looks innocent does not suddenly show its darker side.

Sorry for late reply as I have traveling for the whole week

Sad to know that Thread Owner become commercial and removed details from first post. However all necessary files are still available in thread files. I have tested this and I can say that this EA can copy 100% trading style of Big E. Programmer and thread contributors went too away from original TMS strategy by adding too many other filters/indicators bla bla, but still, one can easily apply original TMS strategy. By default, everything is OFF/False, so to activate original TMS strategy, you need to change 3-4 parameters only.

I am unable to backtest due to some error but on VPS demo, EA works fine. Sorry I don't have code but maybe we can find some good things to add in your LRSF EA.

Hello from Germany, I have installed EA, work, but it does not take trades, I have read attached PDF file, but I cannot fix it. Can you send the Setting for trandable TMS method, thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hello Mate,

Because this thread is not related to this system, hence we should not talk much about other systems here. You can read PDF file or visit that thread to know more about this. However, I will write final post here for this EA here for anyone who is interested in this.

To copy 80% trading style of Big E, change following parameters only.

-----------------------------------------------------------

AutoBuySell: True

AutoRestartRobot: True

Use TDI Cross: True

Use TDI Slope: True

Min TDO Slope: 3

UseTDICloseOnFlat: True

Rest leave default. That's it. Big E always used H4, so you need patience to let open any trade. Even you place this EA on all 28 pairs, it will take 2-4 trades per day. But if you want to see, how this EA works, then change H4 to M15, and also TDICrossCandleZero: True

To copy 100% trading style of Big E, change following parameters as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------

UseCandle2TradeWindow: True (please read pdf to understand this)

Candle2TradeWindowMinutes: 5 or 10

Use5emaCandleClose: True

Use Stochastic: True

In this case, you will have very rare trades (maybe 2 in a week). There are tens of more filters, the more you will active, the lesser will be the trades. Hopefully, I explained well. Thanks

Thanks in advance,

Hi Pervis,

thank you for this example.

Is far as I understood the Big E strategy, the Heiken Ashi must also close above the 5EMA to count as a crossing.

In the screenshot this is not the case (at least not detected by the EA). Only the wick as above the 5EMA.

This is something the EA checks so if my understanding of the Big E strategy in this respect is wrong please let me know.

I could change this into a parameter so we can play with it and see what happens. What do you think?

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi JoTex,

sorry for my late reply.

The Ea tries to make its trade decisions as much as possible at the start of a new H4 bar. In your examples you mention the time as 10:00, 06:00 and 14:00 but I think that are not starting times for H4 candles. So I am confused.

Anyway, looking at the candles on the 25th of the EURUSD:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The crossing of the TDI happens on the 3th candle. And it should be max the 2nd candle.

Anyway, I remember that Big E said that he actually would trade on the 3th or even 4th candle if the first two bars where really small. That is clearly the case here. So I might build this into a next version of the EA.

If bar < ADR(100)/5 .... do not count it.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi JoTex,

for proof of the strategy I think its best to have a look in the TMS-thread. There you will see heaps of good trades that prove the strategy is sound and well tested.

With my EA I try to automate that proces, as a Trade Manager to manage trades that a trader did manually, and secondary as an automatic trader that will detect optimal entry conditions and enter a trade.

Unfortunately this EA is not yet finished and I am publishing new versions frequently. And we have a few known bugs (I call them minor imperfections ). So looking at demo results is not going to help you much. First we need a stable version.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Many thanks for the feedback jansb000 .

and many thanks for the effort on making this EA working , i will try to test it better so i can try to help. keep up the good work

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I have checked the EA 48 H, it does not realy work

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Jansb,

Regarding the candle, Big E used APB candle (not Heiken Ashi), I know there is a bit difference in the calculation. Personally, using the closed of Japanese Candlestick or APB is not make sense for me. In fact, if we look at some Big E training charts, we can see he did not use APB's closed  (even if number of candles changed color if it was small). Considering the size of candles instead would be better, I think...

Also, I don't know if we can apply the PCRF (PCRF is Phx62's term) on your Magnified Price indicator would be an idea?
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...26#post7221926

--- 帖子 #319 ---
1)

I will look into a check for candle size and see if that gives us better trades.

2)

For the PCRF I must admit that I do not know how to detect them so that makes it difficult to program them. Needs more study on my part.

Hi J1MM,

I rewrote the MEME-code so it can now (version 1.19) also add orders dynamically when the RSI indicates that the price is going in our favour. I will start testing this next week. The new code is currently checking the RSI-5 and RSI-15 but I am not sure if this is the best choice. Will need a lot of testing to find out.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi,

Thank you very much for this great EA. I tray do to backtest with 1.17 but receive many OrderSend error and wonder what's wrong?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
You can simply use the RSI(10) cross the MA 10 of the RSI(10) on either M5 and M15. Your EA will work efficiently. All you want is a trigger to add-on positions after the trade has decided on the trade direction.

To limit the number of add-on positions, you can either use :-

1) the order distance between every add-on position, I use the fraction of the ADR.

or

2) set a time delay between add-on positions. Set to e.g. 2 to 4 hours, this will limit to number of add-on to maximum 2 positions per day/24hours.

This should avoid placing too many add-on positions when the market become choppy in the lower timeframe.

No need to use iCustoms to read the TDI.

Hi all,

I have posted version 1.18.0 of my EA in post #1.

Please feel free to download and test it.

I had to do some last minute debugging. Nevertheless I decided I would release it today as I think that it should work well now.

Anyway, it's enabled for demo-trading only for now. Once we are sure it works fine I will publish this version for trading on real accounts.

What was this last-minute debugging?

The EA has a protection mechanism that limits it to just one single open position at one time.

I tried to change the EA so it would not count orders that were already positive with the SL locking in profit. The idea was that this would enable the EA much earlier to look for a next trading opportunity. Unfortunately, this didn't work as expected so I disabled this new function. It will come back in a later version, but for now I have to first get my order-counting logic better so it will handle multiple order positions (in case of MEME) just as well as single orders.

This is the list of bugfixes:
Inserted Code  * - Bugfix: The function convert_bar() was only designed to convert from a low
*   timeframe to a big timeframe. Now it also supports conversion from a high
*   timeframe like H4 to a low timefrime like M5.
* - Bugfix: The high pips and current pips are now ALWAYS shown with 1 decimal.
* - Bugfix: The RSI check would partly check the wrong timeframe in ntr_check().
* - Testing historic bars on M1 does not always return the correct value. So this
*   check will only be executed on bar[0]. This only infuences checks for past
*   trades and has no effect on normal live trading.

This is the list of changes:
Inserted Code  * - Do not trade pairs with redicilous spreads.
* - Do not trade pair/order types with redicilous swap costs. This can result in
*   some pairs only being traded with BUYS or SELLS. Because the swap-costs for
*   one trade-type can differ greatly from swap-costs for the other type.
* - Pressing 'shift-d' will now enable to store trading data.
* - Added a detecion of green crossing yellow to cl_tdi.
* - Replaced include "cl_bar_basic.mqh" by  "cl_bar.mqh". The latter is a bit
*   more basic, but has more general functions for recognising patterns. This
*   include is actually now used in the LRSF indicator but not just yet in the
*   Expert Advisor.
* - Created a new function ntr_chk_rsi() That will check the RSI. This code was
*   previously multiple times in the big function ntr_check(). It will also be
*   needed if we want re-entries based on the RSI UP or DOWN.
* - Remove the limit order once profit is locked in.
* - Function orders_count() is now optional ignoring orders with locked-in profit.
*   Use this new option with great care as MEME orders might be counted as
*   positives whereas they should actually be counted as a basket and not as
*   individual orders. For now this new option is not used yet.
* - In do_open we now first check generic and symbol tests before the actual
*   trading tests.
* - Added function position_info() which will determine if profit is locked in for
*   whole positions. This function will eventually replace the simpler orders_count().
*   Its not used right now - needs testing.
Cheers...

Hi traders,

This is the final version 1.17.

I found a bug that turned up once in a while. In rare occasions when I had several different pairs on (which is only possible if manually opened), when one of the pairs was positive and needed closing, the other pairs could get closed as well, even when they where not ready to be closed.

This corrected version will trade on real accounts, with max one pair at the same time.

(However, with the scripts you can manually add more pairs.)

Cheers...

Hi traders,

I published the WIP version 1.18.1 in post #1 as well. It had the same bug as version 1.17.

Note that version 1.18 still needs more testing.

If possible please post trades here that you did with version 1.18 on your demo account.

The more data I get, the easier and quicker I can solve problems and move on to the next version.

hello jansb000,

I hit the trade on the weekend and read it carefully. I've been trading TDI for about 1/2 year and I think it's a very good strategy. I read through all the post and then get in touch with my questions. Still much success in testing.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Happy trading. Next weekend version 18 should be released as it seems stable enough. I am now testing with version 19 and version 20 is being worked on as well. Version 19 did a couple of very good trades today. By systematically testing and improving this EA will get better and better.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
WOW - today between 08:00 and 23:00 we had an outage for my internet signal. All the good trades that I mentioned in the previous post where opened before 08:00. I have had outages before, but never nearly so long as this one. Anyway, it's good to know that the EA picks up nicely after the internet came back on line.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
thanks so much for coding this EA jansb000. i am still running v15 and it it taking consistently nice, clean profitable trades. as someone who tried the manual TMS system in my beginning years in forex and the original EA of it, 'experts tool box' with limited success, it is really gratifying to finally have a TMS system trading profitably. bravo!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Jans, do you think you can code a Dashboard? So we can have EA trading all pairs at once?

Also, I think that maybe can be a good idea to add Currency strenght to trade always the good direction, also some kind of Currency exposure protection, meaning that EA will open a Sell on EURUSD but makes no sense to place a sell on a oposite correlation pair... I dont know if I explained correctly...

I will resume testing today, had to uninstall everything cause of some errors with my platform and I also changed my broker...

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi J1mm,

Dashboard

I am thinking about this, but haven't found the time yet. A first version would probably just show the trading opportunities without actually doing the trading. A dashboard is probably a big project in itself. For now my priority is to get the trading results better.

Currency Strength to always trade to correct direction

Could you post a couple of screenshots to explain this further. I have never heard of using curency strength as a filter for trading directions. The signal must be clear at the time when the TDI green crosses red. I always assumed that currency strength indicators are lagging to much to be usefull as filter.

Currency exposure

I know that Emanuel4477 uses a couple of pair-groups and he trades just one pair out of each group. So If a trade uses AUDJPY there will be no other trade with either AUD or JPY, at least until the AUDJPY trade is positive with profit is locked-in by a SL. This is still on my todo list. - Problem is that currency pairs are named differently for different brokers and different account types (like AUDJPYmini, AUDJPYc, AUDJPYzero and more of there variants). I would have to add a parameter with a list of pair names to trade. (and this would also be necessary for your first question about a dashboard).

So much to do, so little time.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi blamshakk,

Great to hear that you are doing well with the EA version 15.

You should consider moving to version 17. Version 15 will time-out soon. I would advise to always have a newer version on test then the version you use for "real" trading. By doing this you get acquainted with the new version and you should see where it makes different choices.

Cheers...

Hello mate,

How many pips? I see you are using it on H1 !

--- 帖子 #337 ---
jansb000 thanks for the information.

would it be possible to request a non-expiring version for v15? it's just that it is really very hard to find a well performing EA. if you look in the original EA thread 'experts tool box' for this system you will find posts of mine dated from early 2012. that is how much of a hard slog retail forex is, i'm sure you understand this. to hear that a well functioning and profitable EA is going to expire when i have settings that are functioning well, is a bit dismaying.

i am happy to set up a new test of v18 alongside, and i hope you would consider my request. Or can you provide a reassurance that newer versions will trade mostly in the same way, but with small bug fixes?

many thanks, blam

HI Blam, nice results Buddy, are you running 4h or 1h??? cheers bud ..

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi blamshakk,

not so easy as you think. This projects consists of many source files. And they all get small changes over time. I will try to recompile version 15 again, but you have to treat it like a new program and test it first to see if it still works as expected. That is the reason of the time limit because I can not keep maintaining old versions. I will re-publish version 15 a.s.a.p. without time limit. But make sure you verify that it still works the same. (I expect it will).

Of course the reason for all those new versions is that it should get a little bit better with each version. Every version will always try to implement TMS (both the 5EMA and the PAC version). So in general every version works the same. But over time the bugfixes and new options result in a program that is different from so many versions in the past. Anyway, if you like version 15 then that is what you will get.

Cheers....

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I run two demo accounts from one broker to test two versions of my EA. And even with the same broker, same internet, same computer, same cable length, i see different trades sometimes that I can not explain other then micro differences in the timing of the program.

These differences can add-up within a week to a few euro's between the instances.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Blam,

if you would test version 1.18.1, but switch off all the new functionality like MEME, it should work similar if not identical to version 15. Maybe something to test for you. That would indeed be the same way of trading with just the bug fixes but without the new stuff.

I would appreciate if you would try this out. If you find big differences I will analyse to see what's going on.

Cheers...

This version has no expiration date.

Note: This version will have some bugfixes as compared with the original version 15 since the include files might have fixes here and there. In general it should work very much the same as the originally released version.Make sure you have the settings the same as in your current version (you might have to make a new set file).

Since the last work-in-progress was released I fixed just one more bug: When switching the chart to different timeframes, the re-init could sometimes delete other graphical objects.

Hi Blam,

may I ask which 14 pairs you are trading and how did you select them (based on low spread or something like that)?

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I,   trade 28 pairs.

more options.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
28 pairs give enough opportunity / day.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
There can be many reasons not to trade certain pairs:Better performance.

Every trading strategy has certain pairs where it performs better then with others. When you trade the pairs that are not matching the strategy well these trades have a higher chance of coming out with a loss, or hold your resources for a long time (preventing more trades with better pairs). High spread.

Once a trade becomes active, it first has to make back the cost of opening the trade. If this is a large amount of pips you might as well select a pair with a low spread. Chances of succes will be noticable better. High swap costs.

The cost for keeping trades open during the nights and weekends vary greatly per pair. This money needs to be made back for the trade to come out in profit. In some cases the swap costs are negative (you actually receive money for holding the trade). Certain pairs have really high swap costs, specially if you do not trade the majors. High Risk.

Lots of traders do not like trading CHF because it has shown erratic behaviour in the past. Wrong timeframes.

Some pairs show really spikey charts in certain timeframes. So, if you want to trade H1 charts you may select other pairs then if you trade D1 charts. The idea is that when you trade a well selected set of pairs you might end up with much more profit then just trade all the pairs. In this project we haven't paid much attention to this yet. As the EA is still under development I trade also with 28 pairs and sometimes I give the EA a go on EURZAR or SILVER just to see if it works. But my goal is to generate as much test-data as I can that I need to find bugs and weak spots. But for trading on real accounts we can be more selective.

Cheers...

Again appreciate your hard work!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi can you share your 14 pairs ??

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi emakys,

These are not limitations but features.The limitation on simultaneous operation (one open position at one time) prevents your account in cases where a news event spikes on multiple pairs. Only one pair wil take the trade. Just imagine what would happen if all GBP-pairs would suddenly start a trade and then go against you (possibly with multiple MEME orders). That could easy blow a small account.

You can easy surpass this limitation. Just use a different MagicNumber for each pair that you trade. The limitation on date means that outdated versions of this EA can not accidentaly be used anymore. After all, this project is still under development and new versions are published regularly. There is a reason for these new developments, they solve bugs. I don't want unexperienced traders to use old versions and stumble over bugs that have been solved in newer versions. Every version works for a number of months on a real account, so you will have plenty of time to switch to a newer version. The EA remains working on demo accounts and the trade-management bit is completely unrestricted. Version 1.15s was a special situation. I took the date-limit out, but it has been in use for a decent amount of time and seems to work quite well. But this is a one off and I will not do this on a regular basis. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #378 ---
hey jansb000

i applied the maginfied price indicator v1.15 on chart but its not showing, what to do

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi mavilakandy,

The rectangles indicate the direction of the price movement (from top to bottom) on the current timeframe, the next higher timeframe and the next-nexthigher timeframe. So if you trade on H4, the color of the rectangles will show the direction of the H4, D1 and W1. The EA will only trade when all colors are the same (red=SELL, blue=BUY). When a rectangle is white it means it can not determine a direction on that timeframe.

The 3 rectangles are only updated once per minute. So initially they can be in the wrong position. This will correct after max. one minute.

Cheers...

You have not installed the correct TDI indicator. Please read this thread from post #1 to find the setup instructions for the TDI indicator.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
There can be several reasons:The EA will take only a few trades per week. So keep running it for at least a month to evaluate it. Are you sure trading is enabled? You must enable trading manually in your MT4 terminal. A little Google will tell you how to do this. Does the EA show a little smiley in the top right corner? Please check these and post a screenshot if you need more help.

the indicator gives you a hint: It says the spread is 35 points.

But in the default settings of the EA the maximum allowed spread in 10 pips.

I suggest to set the Max. allowed spread for AUXUSD to a more suitable value. Maybe 40. I never trade gold so I don't know what a sensible value would be for gold. But it must be bigger then 35.

Hi new traders,

I noticed that some of the recent questions relate to the usage of MetaTrader. If you are new to trading (with an Expert Advisor) please look at the website below. It will teach you all the functions of MT4 and also how to get an EA or indicator working.
https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex...se-metatrader4

Also, whatever your questions about MetaTrader4 or trading in general are. You are probably not the first one with this question and chances are that the answer is already out there. Remember: Google is your friend. But you are still welcome to ask your remaining questions here :-)

Some things to remember:When you run the EA you do not have to also put indicators on the same chart. The EA loads the indicators it needs directly from the indicator folder. You can load the indicators if you like but that will be for your visual reference. The EA doesn't use them. When running an EA: Make sure your computer doesn't go to sleep. When the computer goes in sleep mode it will no longer monitor the price and hence the EA will stop working until the computer wakes up again. When you set MT4 to allow AutoTrading and then start to fiddle with the chart the AutoTrading might be switched off again. Make sure you always check te button "AutoTrading"." Cheers...

Please realise that this EA is still under development and that there might be serious bugs that we haven't found yet. Therefore I do not recommend to put any investment on this EA. Best thing to do is to learn to trade the underlying strategy (Trading Made Simple) by hand. And then use the EA as an assistant to take some of the work out of your hand. But you should always know and recognise when the EA is doing something that can not be explained by the TMS strategy.

There is no such thing as a holy grail in trading. It will always take heaps of study and exercise to become succesfull.

Never risk more then a very small fraction of your money on one single trade. Have the EA running on a demo account for a decent amount of time. Only when you are sure that you know how it works and that it follows the strategy correctly you could start thinking about trading with real money.

Cheers...

hey jansb000

thanks for the response

I am checked the EA with different pairs to know its working process

--- 帖子 #397 ---
yes bro, you are right there is no such holy grail. Have to work for reach places.
Will practise the TMS strategy and then use EA.

hi Jansb000 ,thanks your EA

I am test your EA  v18,  I like use Demo account test EA over 3~4 month ,

if your EA have expire time, could you tell me when the EA will expire ? maybe next version you can display expire time information on chart , thanks.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
The TradeManagement part has no timeout. Only the ExpertAdvisor part. So you will always be able to add a trade manually and let the program handle it for you.

For the EA there is no expire time for demo accounts. For real accounts it is set to 26 weeks.

On real accounts it will do just one trade at the same time. That has to be closed before a next trade is allowed.

Soon this will change and new trades can start if the previous trade is positive and the SL has locked-in profit (is set to a positive value).

Loaded up v18. Is it normal for the Experts tab to show the indicator initializing every .043 seconds?

Also, I put the EA on every chart I want to trade?

So your EA is not going to be entirely free for our live account?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Ictrader,

MT4 decides how often it wants to initialise an indicator. The LRSF EA just uses it to analyse and find entry and exit points. It is not programmed by me how indicators are handled internaly by MT4.

Yes, you have to attach the EA to every chart. On chart => One currency pair.

Hi timidave,

good question. I do not mind to publish a version without time limit AFTER it has been proven to work without major incidents. This is what I did (for the first time) with version 15s.

I do not intend to make this product commercial. But I am very careful not to have lots of old versions around that will still be used in years to come. Maintaining a few versions (published and WIP) is already a lot of work. So I have to protect myself (and you) against old versions that nobody should be using anymore.

I hope that answers your question.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Thanks for the clarification. There seemed to be a constant ramping of my CPU fan, which caused me to look at the MT4 Experts tab (which I don't normaly do). After seeing the constant line items, I was concerned with CPU overhead processing and thought I had caused a runaway condition. I'll carry on and report back any progress (good or not-so-good).

Hi lctrader11,

just checked on my own laptop -> it indeed seems that the indicators get refreshed a lot, on different timeframes. It might be an idea to calculate the indicators inside the EA, and just for the number of bars that I need. These custom indicators are a real performance hog. However my laptop has no problem with heating at all.

It is known that MT4 can take a lot of resources from a PC. Specially when you have a lot of charts open with lots of indicators.

I use my laptop for programming and some debugging and testing. My trading, even on demo accounts, is done on a separate computer:

Jansb000, once again, thank you for this great job you're doing here. I'm very excited about my trading prospects because of your EA.

1. Please how is the INITIAL stop loss of your EA determined because sometimes it looks like mine is occasionally bigger than needed.

2. Then also, can you PLEASE make the number of trades the EA can take per trade optional? I, personally would love to trade some selected pairs at the same time; pairs that dont correlatet

3. Don't you think your EA would need a news filter?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi timidave,

This is how its coded:
Inserted Code     double ord_sl = ls_order.get_sl();
if (ord_sl == 0.0) {
if (ord_type == OP_BUY) {
double lv_slprice = ord_oprice - pips2val(gADR100);
double lv_tpprice = ord_oprice + pips2val(gADR100*2);
ls_order.set_sl(lv_slprice);
ls_order.set_tp(lv_tpprice);
} else if (ord_type == OP_SELL) {
double lv_slprice = ord_oprice + pips2val(gADR100) + pips2val(lv_sym_spread);
double lv_tpprice = ord_oprice - pips2val(gADR100*2);
ls_order.set_sl(lv_slprice);
ls_order.set_tp(lv_tpprice);
}
if (!ls_order.modify()) {
errmsg = StringConcatenate( "OrderModify: ", ERR_AND_LOC );
XPrint(LOG_LEVEL_ERR, errmsg);
return;
}
} // p_sl == 0
The SL is taken as the ADR(100) pips from the start-point.

When using MEME the first MEME will be activated at ADR(100)/2. So this SL will never ever be reached.

For every new MEME-order the SL will be moved upto ADR(100)*2.5. It willl not go further than that.

This is how it has been described in the Trading Made Simple thread.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #413 ---
No can do. For my own protection I do not want more than one trade active. When a trade goes wrong, often a lot of other trades go wrong as well.

However, in version 1.19, this rule is lifted to some extend. As soon as profit is locked in for the first trade (SL moved to take at least 5 pips profit) a new trade can be done.

In your case, if you want to trade un-correlated pairs, you can simply use different MagicNumbers for each group of pairs you want to trade.

Please refer to these documents for explanaition:
https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1359
https://www.blackwellglobal.com/mt4-magic-numbers/

The MagicNumber is a parameter in the Input-dialog.

Actually I had version 1.15s on the last week myself on two accounts. And it took a couple of trades.

Please post a screenshot so I can see the text at the left upper corner. It might give us a clue. You can make your account number invisible before you post your screenshot.

Personally I use version 1.17 on a small live account and I accept the risk of any bug that I made, next weekend I will upgrade to version 1.18 on my live account. Other versions I only use on demo accounts. Version 1.18 is just released and version 1.19 is near complete on the test-bed. Version 1.20 is my development version and the versions 1.21 and 1.22 are for testing new features that might never make it to a released version.

Version 1.15 was reported in the thread as being partiicularly profitable, but you can use a never version in you like.

I see that you are trading on the Daily timeframe. I was trading on H1. That should explain it. The EA will wait for the best entry which, on the D1 will only happen once every so many days.

It can be frustrating on the D1 that you wait for days, weeks sometimes, and then see the EA miss a good entry because it decided that it didn't like the entry-signals. Why do you not use the scripts to start a trade manually when you see a good entry? In post #1 you can find more about the scripts.

Please try them on a demo account first until you know how they work. Surely, you would be able to have a look at your charts once per day?

hi all friends,

There are 3 type entry strategy

1. enter on breaking PAC

2. enter on breaking MA5

3. Enter on TDI and STO

which one you like it  or suggest ? why?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
There are only two supported methods in your list: PAC and 5EMA. For both these methods the TDI and STO are used to confirm either a PAC or 5EMA entry.

PAC trading seems to be more profitable at trading D1 timeframe. At least thats what some people in the TMS thread claim. the 5EMA method is the way the TMS method started in the first post. It is more suitable for H4. Personally, I have the feeling that 5EMA should also work well on D1.

This EA is actually named after the third entry method: Low Risk Stress Free. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=588548

However, this entry method is not yet supported (i.e. not well tested yet).

According to the original poster, he uses only TDI and STO in overbought or oversold conditions for easy trades. Eventually this method will be supported as well. My experience with this third method, using manual trading, made me decide that this method would get a low priority on my todo list.

The entry-methods work better (in both PAC and 5EMA cases) if you take Price Action and Support and Resistance (PASR) into consideration. PASR is not so easy to program. Therefore, if you (can and) want to apply it, you have the option to take your trades manually and have the EA manage the trade.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #422 ---
hi Jansb000

because I saw the post #339 , blamshakk provide his setting (for v15), the entry strategy is select "enter on TDI and STO" so  I write this question .

I will use ma5 (whit H1 chart  for test )..  thanks

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Oooh, I see. I stand corrected. The third method is indeed just using TDI and STO for entry signal. After trading it manually for a while I decided I would create a EA for several TMS variants. But for LRSF the original poster doesn't seem to answer questions anymore. So I gave that a lower priority. My trading didn't give the best results from the tree methods, but possible with the trend check (the 3 rectangles) and some other options the EA provides it may work out good. Do not use this setting yet in the EA yet. We have to test it first, and at this moment I focus on 5EMA.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi Jans,

An idea for MeMe trades

Actually, I feel like MeMe trades is just to put more risk in your operation without an actual reason more than the hope that price will reverse, true that if price does, you have more probability of a succesfull trade even if the first trade was wrong and price went nuts...

A good idea I think would be to use MeMe trades as an Averaging down method, let me explain...

Let's say you are in an uptrend defined by indicators (As we have an EA we have to rely on indicators).

Then you have a BUY entry based on strategy but after you enter the operation price quickly reverses, conditions for an uptrend still valid, so you just activate 1st MeMe trade after, let's say, 40 pips loss.

Price then goes back and trend continues, you are now at +40 pip win on 2nd trade and 0 pips on first one, we are going to manage both orders independently so trail stopper activates for second one so we leave it with +35 pips win and 1st one still running, price then reverses again and for the second time another order is opened at -40 pips, conditions for an uptrend still valid, so MeMe order is activated again, this time trend resumes successfully, second order closes successfully at +40 pips due to trail stop and first one at +40 as well due to its own trail stop.

Orders being managed independently makes more sense for me than just puting a lot of lots in risk just to close an order in break even.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
MEME is not about just averaging down. And it is also not like what Grid trading systems.

TMS 5-Method uses the Average Price Bar another version of the Heiken Ashi price.

When you use the APB/HA to swing trade the higher timeframes D1 and W1 for example, you use the retracement to build up your positions in the market. You use both money management and position sizing to build up a basket of trades, usually 5 trades in one basket. Some traders uses more trades in one single basket.

You average up when your trades (open positions) are locked (protected) with profits.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
After releasing a couple of preliminary versions for versions 1.18 I have released the final version 1.18.

The development of the EA will of course continue with version 1.19, 1.20 etc.

Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Version 1.15s has no time-limit. Furthermore It has some bug-fixes.

For version 1.15s to work as the original 1.15:

- Switch OFF MEME

- Switch OFF soft break-even

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yes, you have to experiment with the settings for break-even.

These are default ON, but that might not be the most profitable setting.

I think that I will switch OFF the Soft break-even on my demo just to see how it will work out.

Soft break-even:

When the profit reaches +15 pips and then goes below +3 pips the trade will be taken out.

Hard break-even:

When the profit reaches +30 pips the SL will move to +5 pips.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Risk percent is not used yet. Code is in place but "commented out" for now. You must use fixed lot sizes.

Auto lot calculation will eventually be added, but its not a top priority for now.

Cheers...

Hello Jans,

as always a pleasure to contribute to your post, if you feel like I'm trying to add "too much garbage" or "bad ideas" feel free to tell me!!

During my tests, I found out that the 3 way trend filter is filtering a lot of bad entries, however, is filtering also a lot of good ones, so maybe is just not a really good filter...

I was testing and found out that a D1 stochastic applied on H4 chart works like a charm with TMS Strategy...

Look how sweet entries are we having, and this is only using Stochastic at D1 (5,3,3) and Stochastic at H4 (5,3,3)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

And maybe the trend filter could then be only used when we are under a heavy trend and D1 stochastic is going flat in an OB/OS area like in this trades:

Thanks for your good EA and also for your prompt support. Please look into the following point:

I did not make any changes in the default parameters except The Max Spread for Trades.

Hello jansb000,

It was my mistake. Nothing wrong with the above mentioned lot size. It is due to - open positions are being closed partly.

Sorry for the confusion.

I really like your ideas. Just keep them coming.

You are actively trying to figure out how the trading strategy works and how it can be improved. That makes us all think about this TMS trading method and will eventually make us better traders. Please keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
This looks really good, and... the basic code to implement this is already available in my EA. I'll see what I can do this weekend to implement this.

Next week I should have some more time anyway to work on this.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
hi, any human intervention ?? Automatic ?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi, Jans,  I really think that your EA is basically doing fine now, but there's always room for improvements. Any more suggestions to improve the EA  would be great but in my opinion, such features(improvements) should be made optional in the EA. Until new improvements are tested over time,i think  they should be made optional in the EA. For instance, the MEME feature in the EA is doing well, it has saved me from several  trades that could  have ended up in a negative, yet I don't go beyond the count of '2' for MEME.  I love the MEME feature, despite the risk

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I was thinking along the same lines. I want to make the default settings to behave like version 15. This version seems to work good (without MEME).

One of the readers of this thread is currently testing these settings with version 1.18 to make sure it still works as version 1.15. When this is confirmed I will make that the default.

For new developments:I have a short list of stuff that I want to add over time, I want to concentrate now on making the EA take more trades. It seems to miss some good entry signals at the moment. I want the EA to stay in good trades longer, instead of coming out all the time with just $0.30. In version 1.19 this might already been solved. I am getting good test data from this version. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #444 ---
AWESOME! Look forward to it.

Great! Well done.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hello Jans,

I am using BIM_LRSF_18 and it is doing well.

Please see attached screenshot where you can see USDJPY, EURUSD and USDCHF has 3 open positions 0.02 lot each.

The first one was opened by me manually. The set up is 'Never trade more than 0.04'. Still it is opening 3 positions of 0.02 each.

Please have a look into this whenever you find time.

Another matter, if the indicators (3 rectangles) are showing red or green and if trades are not happening for quite long time, do you suggest to do manual trades ? I have done it in few cases; but does it harm the automatic functioning of the EA ? Please clarify.

Thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #447 ---
There is no problem taking a manual trade (using the scripts) at all. The EA will recognize the trade and it will add TP and SL. After that it will manage the trade according to the settings in de EA parameters. I do add manual trades myself and they are managed perfectly. Sometimes when I see a trade that the EA took, and I think that the price is now a at a better entry point I even add a manual trade (which is a first MEME order). The EA will recognise this as well and it will add/change the TP and SL accordingly. Try this on a demo account to see how this works.

Actually, in the thread, I recommend to have the EA on a demo-account and let it send notifications when it does a trade. You can then manually decide if you are going to follow the proposed trade on a real account. Added bonus: on a demo account the EA is not limited to just one open trade at any tiime, so even when a trade is on you will still get notifications for more trades. It is then up to your own wisdom if you take those trades. I only take a second trade if the first one has made at least 10 pips (with soft break-even) or when SL has locked in at least 5 pips. So I am sure there will never be more than one trade running into MEME mode.

Cheers...

Hi all,

in a couple of weeks the new EU-rules for CFD-trading become active. This will hit forex trading as well.

Does anybody have information about what it will mean for YOU with YOUR broker?

As far as I understood the max leverage will go down to 1:30 and the margin for a trade will increase 10-fold. So instead of $10 for a 0.01 trade the margin will be $100. This effectively means the end of small accounts. This info is based on what I heard hear and there so I may be completely wrong.

Would like to hear if you can confirm this or correct me if I am wrong. I am also not sure if EU-citizens can open accounts in Australia or the US to go around the new limitations.

If it is true, it will mean that a MEME trade will become very costly (although the margin is returned when the trade closes). It is of the utmost importance that we make sure that "naked" trading without MEME works as expected! Also, hedging will become very expensive. Make sure that you are prepared.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I have been trading with 1:25 leverage for many years and it was never a problem with MEME. In fact MEME was intended originally and work best in low leverage products like the stock market 1:1. I only adapted the MEME to forex trading in 2011.

I have not tested your verison 1.18 yet but I think this should be the final version.

Your next new version should start new at V2.0 with a new 'blade MEME'. We complete our development and forward testing till end of this year. So far the results have been good with higher win rates but the drawndown duration (period) did not improve as expected but the drawdown limit 15% to 20% is still good and we need to work on this technicality.

The new pre-name 'blade' is not finalised but we just gave this new baby a new name.

More technical details in 2019.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hello Jans,

Thanks for the clarifications.

One of the point which was not addressed by you is, total lot size of open positions of a currency pair is exceeding the limit of set parameter.

For example, I have set 'Never trade more than this: 0.04. But, today total lot size of open positions for USDJPY is 0.08 (4 open trades of 0.02 each).

Another matter for your consideration - it would be good if we can identify or differentiate the manual-trades and auto-trades from the comment column.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #451 ---
No idea about it. Hope the new rules (if any) will not effect the open trades of existing clients.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi mavilakandy,

the minimum lotsize and maximum lotsize are intended to limit your risk when we use automatic lotsize calculation.

Example 1:

When you have a very small account and automatic lotsize would be 0.009 no trade would happen. In that case the minimum lotsize would make this 0.01 or any other value you set.

Example 2:

When you have a large account, and automatic lotsize would be 1.33, you might not want to trade more then 0.5. Maybe because you want to reservere some capital to trade with another method or simply because you dont want to risk more then a certain fixed amount.

At this moment, automatic lotsize calculation is switched off (hardcoded), so every trade should always use the minimum lotsize. The parameter maximum lotsize is not used. I will take it out from the next version. The whole automatic lotsize calculation was copied from an earlier project that I did. I will make it clearer to avoid confusion.

With MEME all the extra orders added will always be the same as the first order. This is the principle of MEME as I took it from the TMS thread. You can limit the maximum number of MEME orders in the parameters.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi, Jans, I had a hit on my demo account after almost 3 weeks of successful trading. This single hit from Gbpusd (with 3 MEME) wiped off all the gains I had made. For now, I would explore the 4hrs chart where I can aim for bigger profits closer to my ADR stop losses. When we aim for profits much more smaller than our stop losses, there would be overall much smaller gains or losses.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hello Jans,

Last 2-3 days, the price was moving up for USDCHF. But, as per 3-rectangle-indicator showing all red, a manual 'sell trade' was done by me.

With few hours of gap between each trades, another three 'sell trades' were done by the system; but the price was moving up.

Result is, this pair has big draw-down.

Entry strategy was: Enter on breaking the MA5.

Same/similar thing happened for USDJPY and EURUSD.

Appreciate your comments on the above. Hope I am not pressurizing you.

Thanks and regards,

Mohanan Mavilakandy

I guess those 3 sell trades were MeMe trades?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hello Jans,

Sorry, I do not know how to make out, by looking at the chart, whether it is MEME trades or not (appreciate if you please explain it). Please see the screenshot of the page here. Probably you can find out from there.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Yep, MeMe trades  EA working as expected, you should read the posts!

MeMe stands for Multiple Entries Multiple Exits... When you enter a position and PA goes against you, it will prepare a MeMe trade at ADR/2 pips, then recalculate your exit to exit at Break even + small profit. This is a good tool to recovery from a bad trade but has a lot of risk as I think it should be improved in a way it takes the MeMe trade with a little bit more of common sense than blindly at ADR/2. However the EA is working as expected as I said

Anyway MeMe used with standard EA trades is working great as you always trade with the short term trend and long term trend which make a 3 step MeMe trade unlikelly to happen.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi mavilakandy,

The first order is the original order. All the orders added by the EA are MEME trades. They are always the same size and same direction as the original trade.

The theory (and many examples) of MEME trading is explained in the TMS thread (https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622).

In this thread I focus on implementing this strategy. Not so much if it is a good strategy or not. I leave that discussion to the TMS thread.

Having said that, let's look at your original trade on the H4 chart.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You entered manually with a SELL, although the price had been going down for a while. In this case the price was already at the lowest that we could expect. This becomes clear when we look at the D1 chart (with support and resistance lines).
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So, for manual trading, you chose a bad entry position. (Trading made Simple turns out not to be so simple after all).

The EA tries to correct your bad trade by adding better entry points. This has a major advantage: It avarages your entry point up (the sum of entry prices divided by the number of trades). So collectively your position has now a better entry point. Same goes for the take-profit which is taken as the average entry-price + a few pips. Hopefully, the price will now start going down again and eventually hit the take-profit.

When you look at the monthly you can see that the price is not in a strong trend at the moment. So you have to go for the swings.

This MEME-thing can appear counter intuitive, but as it turns out it nearly always saves the day. However, sometimes it doesn't work and the whole trade goes to pot.

Therefore, only add a new trade (on a different pair) after your first position is in profit. And if you do a bad trade, consider to exit it early, or hope that MEME will solve the problem.

MEME is intended for getting a better entry-point in cases where you chose the direction of the trade correct, but you just went in to early.

When you chose the direction wrong, 6 MEME orders are usually enough to ride the swing. The EA makes the same mistake sometimes.

Cheers...

How did you get a D1 indicator on your H4 chart? Or is this a special custom indicator?

There you go boss,

Just for hype purposes:

In first indi windows, 5,3,3 D1 Stoch with 5,3,3 H4 stoch

You can ignore other indicators, it's just that I'm fanboy of BK Woodie indie and I put it everywhere.

Hello Jans,

Thank you so much for your explanations. Actually I did not look at several TF charts.

Whenever I saw 3 rectangles same color and if there is no open trade in the ccy pair, I do a manual trade.

Now, it is proved that is wrong way of doing things and I have to be more careful.

Again, thanks a lot for your support.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Well explained. I am learning lot of things from you.

Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Yes, I want to avoid "over-developing". Just bugfixing from now on.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
You are 100% right. The EA often closes too early instead of riding the trend. I am still working on that.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
The 3 rectangles are showing long term directions of the price on 3 different timeframes. That is a good first indicator of where the price might be going. When this happens, then you start looking for a good entry for your manual trade. The EA looks at a crossing in the TDI (red-green) and the Stochastic. When they align the EA checks the lower timeframes MA and RSI to make sure that conditions are all supporting the direction of the 3 rectangles.

When I enter manually I also check if there are support/resistance lines nearby:I have horizontal lines that I manually added. The big round numbers are often treated as S/R The low-high of the previous week are often treated as S/R The 200EMA is often treated as S/R Always trade away from those S/R lines.

On top of that you might check for certain candle setups (price-action) near those SR-lines. That should give you the final confirmation.

And finally, check the planned news events on Forex Factory. (Then pray that Trump does not send tweets ).

So that's a lot of checking - that explains why I like to automate these checks in an EA. Of course you can all do it manually. That is why I test new ideas manually for a couple of weeks before even trying to build it into an EA.

If all these checks are in your favour you should have a good chance of a profitable trade.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Well understood. When there are lot of conditions checked manually we may tend to miss something or make mistakes. So, it would be good if an EA can do all those job. Let us hope, your final version of the EA is the answer for that. Again, thanks for your time and patience to explain the matter in detail.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I hope you don't get me wrong. The current version 1.xx is based on MEME and you still have lots of maintenance work with this version.

When I share my "blade" MEME model, it should be a total new version. Trust me, the entries for the new "blade" model will be simpler becaue we drop the use of the TDI in our EA. TDI only use for trade planning but we run our EA without any indicator. Simple raw price and price action.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi J1mm,

turns out we don't need the new (custom) indicator. We can simply use the std stochastic(25,15,15)

From top to bottom:

- GBPAUD H4

- TDI(10,34,3,7)

- Stochastic_mtf D1(5,3,3) (H4 invisible)

- Stochastic H4(25,15,15)

- Stochastic H4+D1(5,3,3)(25,15,15)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In this picture you can see that using the D1 stochastic would prevent many false signals but also some good signals. I will make the usage of this extra Stochastic optional and then we can see if it improves our results.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Enabling the Stochastic filter would disable the other trend filters? or what will be now the logic? Just to avoid "too much filtering" and at the end not taking any trade XD

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hi to All from Germany. How can I check that the EA does realy work. Yesterday at 1H Charts, at all 8 main currency, it does not take any trades. Last 12  Hours at 15 min Chats, also no trades. I take the last final Version 1.18 EA

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi nschwegl,

look at the messages in the left-upper corner of the chart. It will tell you if it is working.

On the right-upper corner you should see the EA-name with a smiley-face.

Also you could post a screenshot so we can analyse if anything is wrong.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
It could indeed replace some of the other filters. Like the 3 rectangles (and the 2 confirming MA's, but they are OFF by default).

We have to approach this step by step. I don't want to deviate too much from pure TMS. Avoiding false signals or early entries can contribute to better trading. And the Stochastic has always been a part of TMS. The 3 rectangles for indicating trend where my own addition with the same in mind: avoid false signals. So replacing my own addition by another that is closer to the original strategy seems like a good idea to me.

Cheers...

Hi JansB000,  an attachment from screen

My suggestion is a version with TDI, H4 Stoch and D1 Stoch as confirmation.

The challenge comes in Oversold or Overbought stochastic on strong trends and here is when 2 EMAs come handy I would say, tonight I will spend some time backtesting manually...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Actually the Stochastics was used  by Craig Harris Natural Flow Forex system and Big E attended his seminars first then later attended CompassFx seminars and he moved on to the Synergy model by Dean Malone who use the TDI.

Big E blended both methods into one and became the 5-Method. The TMS thread is just a continuation of the 5-Method discussions.

You will read about his history in his old thread Craig Harris Stochastics Method in the Commercial Content forum.
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=211188

Its interesting how he blended two methods into one.

Hi, I openend an brand new account at axitrader, switch to EA 1.17 and to 5M Charts, no trades are taken

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Maybe, when the D1 stochastic is in overbought/oversold we should not use this indicator and go back to the original (current) indicators. So the Stochastic D1/H4 would only be used "in the middle" section.

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
The problem with EA's is that they can not quickly make an assessment like we humans do. Some decisions that humans can make easily are difficult to automate. To make the EA emulate the behaviour of human trading there is no getting around to find replacements for some of those tests.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi nschwegl,

You settings appear correct. In the left-upper corner, the text starting with "Trade:" tells you why it is not trading on that particular chart.

Example: "Trend MA5 not clear (Missed earlier bar)".

The EA is designed for H4 and D1 charts, but some people report good results on H1. I would definitely not go lower then H1 charts.

You have to setup the EA on many charts (I use 28 pairs, others use 15 pairs). Then you should get a couple of trades per week.

Read post #1 and make sure you have the right TDI indicator installed.

Let it run for a couple of days and you should then see some trading.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I believe trading has to be discretionary and based on the traders experience and skills set. All decisions have to be made by the trader not the expert advisor.

I only use the expert advisor only to help me execute some of the my trading tasks (not all) when I do not want to watching my charts all the time. Also when I trade multiple pairs at the same time, I cannot possibly do so many checks across 20 pairs as fast as an expert advisor can. For example during volatile periods, the expert advisor can check the spread and process price re-qoutes, place timed orders, etc.  The indicators are only used by the expert advisor to perform some tasks but with some a limitations when the trader cannot be at their trading terminal.

For example, when we are trading intraday, we can set the expert advisor to trade only during a selected hours like using the start and end time of a particular market session for certain strategy.

Lots of possibilities which can be programmed in an expert advisor.

To emulate human behaviour in trading is another area with potential in software development but still far away. I did some study into neural networks but did not continue.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Yesterday I was not able to backtest I will do it ASAP, however when Stochastic is oversold usually it it going to start turning flat if we are in a Heavy trend, at this monent we should as you said, ignore it and just rely on the other indicators asuming we are in a heavy trend, we will probably miss the first reversal but we we will catch later on the first pullback if trend changes.

I will prepare soon some screenshots...

You will have the visual indicators the same as used by the EA. The stochastic that you use on your chart (H1 and D1), is not used by the EA.

The EA uses just a single Stochastic (8,3,3).

Hi nschwegl,

Please refer to this post. It shows you exactly in which folder to install the TDI.
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post10125984

Make sure you use the TDI Indicator that can be downloaded from post #14. There are many TDI Indicators around, so it is important to have the right one as the EA must address the indicator in a specific way.

The errormessage you got is what I added to version 1.19wip1. During the initialisation of the EA I do now check if the TDI Indicator is correctly installed and returns valid data.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Default the TP is set to: ADR(100)*2. Once set, you can manually drag the TP to wherever you like.

There are a lot of protections in the EA that will take out a trade with profit when the TP is not hit. But, having said that, a well placed TP can give more profit.

Cheers...

Many thanks sir, pls keep up the good work.

ANNOUNCEMENT: NEW DEFAULT SETTINGS

Due to the new regulations for trading CFD products (including forex) I have decided to change the default settings for the LRSF Expert Advisor.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The trading algorithm remains the same, but I try to prevent that the EA surprises someone with a sudden big margin. Once the new rules are settled and we know what their effect is for us hobby-traders we can discuss changing the defaults again.

My broker announced that the new rules will start taking effect as of Aug 1st, 2018. So by changing the defaults now, any open position should be long closed before it can harm our accounts. Those who trade with bigger accounts can deviate from the default settings as they see fit.

When you still trade with older versions you have to decide for yourself if you want to change your settings.

Cheers...

Hi all,

I just posted version wip 1.01 of the LSRF Monitor in post #1.

I added columns for TDI and Stochastic. Also I tried to solve the problem of character spacing.
Attached Image
Usage

Column 1: Name of the symbol.

Column 2: These are the trends of the current, next and next-next timeframe (i.e. H4, D1 and W1).

Column 3: This is the result of the TDI-check for Crossing and Continuation.

Column 4: This is the result of the Stochastic-check for current timeframe and next timeframe.

Challenge

The whole idea of this monitor is to help to quickly decide which charts might be of interrest to investigate for a possible trade.

If you feel that you found a good trade-opportunity (according to TMS) that is not correctly identified by this monitor then I would like to ask you to post your findings (with screenshots) and we can then discuss further options. Any problem we find and solve here will also lead to a better EA as I use the exact same tests in both the monitor and EA.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #501 ---
So, the idea is that when all of these align, we take a trade? Basically?

Hello Jans,

1.  Re LSRF monitor, appreciate if you please explain a little more, how to read the indicators:

If my understanding is correct,

Column 2 is reflecting the trend and  we may BUY if all 3 stars blue, or SELL if all 3 stars are red.

Column 3 is for TDI-check. How it should look like ? This also should be with 'X' mark in same colour ? These 2 'X' marks stand for what ?

Column 4 is for Stochastic. Similar to column 2.

Kindly explain, what would be an ideal trade-able scenario ? All indicators are in same colour ?

2. Please see the attached screenshot, indicators list on the left side.

'bim  -  tms' is not seen in many of the broker's MT4. Could you please explain how to create that directory ?

Thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Basically - NO!!!

When doing manual trading one would need to browse trough all charts to check for suitable setups. That can be a time consuming task.

The LRSF Monitor automates some of these tasks by quickly showing essential information in one single screen.

However, there is a lot more to check. The monitor just helps you to quickly discard charts that you do not have to check.

Please refer to post #467 for an overview.

Note that the LRSF Monitor is not yet finished and might contain bugs. I just post the WIP versions to give you guys an early insight.

LRSF-Monitor: Trend
Attached Image

We quickly see that the trend is not consistent. Although the current timeframe shows UP, the next higher timeframe shows DOWN. This indicates a big risk as a BUY would be against the higher level trend. - No trade on this pair now!

Look at this picture that I copied from a Emmanuel7788 post in the TMS thread:

The 3 trends in my monitor show you the short-term-, intermediate- and primairy trend. When all 3 go in the same direction we trade with lower risk.

Please check this with your charts and see if the monitor gives the correct trend.

LRSF-Monitor: TDI-Indicator
Attached Image

The TDI is actually showing a cross of the red-green in a BUY direction (indicated by "X-").
Attached Image

There is always discussion about the angle of the crossing. Is the angle between 12-14:00 o'clock for a buy or between 16:00-18:00 for a SELL? Please check what the monitor tells you with your own charts. Lets find the bugs!

The other signal a TDI may give is a continuation (indicated by "-X").
Attached Image

A continuation is also considered a valid entry-signal as it usually occurs aftger a small draw-back.

In the screenshot the little draw-back is the small red-candle in the middle of a huge UP-move.

The stochastic appears to be supporting an UP trade. This is the Stochastic(8,3,3) as advised in the TMS-thread.

There is only one difference with the previous version: The calculation of the Weekly Control Candle is now a lot better. It used to be a simple rectangle around the last 4 weeks on lower timeframes. Now, it correctly identifies the real Weekly Control Candle and only draws that single rectangle.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #517 ---
So... what is a Weekly Control Candle (WCC)?

A WCC is seen on the weekly chart and it is the candle that "controls" candles that come after it.

On lower timeframes like H4 and D1 we see that price often uses the LOW and HIGH of the WCC as support and resistance.

I borrowed a picture from Strat's PASR thread:
Attached Image

As long as the price is within the WCC there is a high posibility that the price react to the HIGH and LOW of the WCC, in other words we can expect that the price will range between the HIGH and LOW of the WCC. When the price finally breaks the WCC we can anticipate a big move (because it means that on the W1 timeframe higher or lower bar has started to form.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Jansb,

This is to report a problem with EA, it continues to modify SL from .75577 -> .75639 back and forth. Can you take a look on this?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
How to trade the WCC

Now we know that there is a high chance that price will react to the HIGH or LOW of the WCC we can decide how to trade it:

When the price approaches the LOW or HIGH (and comes closer then ADR[100]/2) we wait until we see how the price reacts to this level.

When it bounces there will be a new TMS setup in the direction that points away from the HIGH or LOW.

The green circle shows an example. The orange circle appears to form a bounce too when we look at the stochastic. However, wait for the TMS setup to form.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When it breaks there will usually be a retest before the price moves away from the HIGH or LOW.

The pink circle shows how the price started to move away from the HIGH but then bounced again (confirming HIGH now as resistance).

This is a pattern that we often see around support and resistance lines.

So, for those who like to enter their trades manually, you have now a powerful tool to place your trades even better!

LRSF EA 1.15.s

I found another difference between V15 and V15s:
The initial TP was original ADR(100) * 2, but I later changed that to ADR(100) / 2. This was in anticipation of the re-entry feature that was supposed to become available in v1.19 but is now delayed. So I have set the calculation of the TP back to how it was.
There are no other changes to this old version of the EA.

Better to change to V18 to handle this trade further:

Hi nschwegl,

I am sorry that this trade is not going well.

In general: If a trade does not go as planned: take it out as early as possible!

I am sorry to say, but when you trade real money you must be prepared to take the loss. Therefore, never risk more then 1%-2% of your account on any one trade. To calculate the lotsize of your initial trade (when using MEME) is a bit difficult, but it would have been better if you used the minimum lotsize of 0.01, at least until you understand exactly how this TMS strategy works. The strategy with MEME nearly always works, but there will be exceptions now and again. You must always have this worst case scenario in your mind.

You say that you use 20 pips stop-loss when trading manually. With the TMS-strategy the stop-loss is determined by different factors. With MEME the stop-loss is in principle ADR[100]*2.5 which is a lot more then 20 pips. With human trading it is often possible to use tight SL, but for the EA a bit of extra "breathing space" is needed. Adjust your lotsize accordingly.

In this case it looks like EURUSD has opened a 4th MEME order and then turned around. It is now near break-even.

On monday I would check if the price is still going up and when in doubt you must decide if you want to take the position out or not. To decide, check the TDI on the M5 chart. When the red and green go below the yellow this means it can start to go down.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If a trade goes really really wrong I manage this as follows:

- I start a trade. It goes against me and eventually the EA adds 5 MEME orders.

- The price still goes against me. When the loss (in pips) gets near ADR[100]*2.5 I must make a decision.

- When I do nothing, as soon as the price hits -ADR[100]*2.5, the stop loss is hit and I lose on all orders. This is a BIG loss.

- However, maybe a better way to deal with it is to manually close the oldest order. Yes you lose on this order.

- This will reduce the number of total orders, and there is room for a new MEME order. And so on.

Since I started working on this EA I have seen 3 positions going to the final stop-loss. In all those cases (they all happened in the same week) I suffered a big loss, nearly halving my (small) account. What I did then is to limit the EA to just one open position at the same time. Since then I have seen no more disasters, but when it will happen the next time I will use my new strategy of manually closing the oldest order in stead of suffering the loss of the whole position.

Why did 3 positions go wrong in one week? When something happens in the world that makes one currency pair react strongly. There is a big chance that other currency pairs will react to the same news event. So the chance that multiple currency pairs go against you at the same time is actually a lot higher then one might think. Therfore I now allow just one open position at any one time.

Note: As of version 19, when a position is positive (and the stop loss is moved so that it can not go negative anymore) The EA will accept a new position.

Cheers...

Hi all,

MEME Saved another trade.

I started this trade manually, and it went against me immediately.

The sceenshot is taken from H1 chart (for better visibility of the MEME trades) but the trade was initiated on the H4 chart.

Notice that the bar that closed the trade went a lot further down. Look at this on the M5 chart:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You can see that on this chart the HA made a nice move down. Simply staying in the trade until the HA crossed the 5EMA would have made another 20 (5x4) pips.

Something to think about.

Hi nschwegl,

I have not yet seen anybody posting consistent positive results with version 1.15s. So as far as I am conserned this version is still under test.

The only posts I have seen were from version 1.15 (without 's') and with version 1.15s we are trying to make it work exactly as the older version 1.15.

Before I release a version that trades real money I need to see some evidence that some users use it succesfully on a demo account.

Yes, please do that. Posting results, good or bad, helps us all to learn and helps me to improve on the EA.

Results may differ between brokers and timezones so with more info we get a better view on how the EA behaves under certain conditions.

Anecdote: For another project (also an EA that worked with hedging) I had two instances of MT4 on the same computer with the same version of the EA. The two trading accounts were from the same broker and even on the same brokers'server. And still there were differences between the orders taken.

That shows how delicate the trading process can be.

Hi nschwegl, was this with version 1.18 or version 1.15s?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi blamshakk,

I noticed that the market appears to be turning, at least for some major pairs. And Trump has been very active lately as well. Some pairs, on the higher timeframes, appear flat. Version 15s can do well in a quiet trending market, but under the circumstances that we see now you will see a lot of small loosing trades. This will last until a new trend has established. With MEME on you might have a better result now, but of course there is the risc of a MEME trade going wrong.

Version 1.15s is codewise an exact copy of version 1.15. Only some bugfixes in the include files might have made their way into the newer version 1.15s.

But these include files are also used in the newer versions so I know that they work good.

If you want to trade without MEME, make sure that you only trade on pairs that show a good trend on the monthly and weekly. Leave the other pairs alone for now.

This is of course also a good strategy with MEME set to ON. If you want to trade 28 pairs with MEME, I would suggest to check your trades and don't be afraid to take them out if you are not sure. When they go against you big time, consider taking the first trade out.

The best results are possible with manual trading and using the EA just as a trade manager. The LRSF Monitor can lead you to the best opportunities.

In the end we all must learn to trade TMS to be succesful.

I do not use version 15 myself. For me its version 18 for my real account and version 19 on my demo account. I am now waiting for the new EU-trading rules to take effect to see how they work out for me. That might change the whole game anyway.

Cheers...

Version 1.19wip

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi,

Pls see attached forward test report for last one week, without any manual interference.

The result is not bad, though it is a bit slow.

A total of 24 charts are opened. LRSF_15s, LRSF_18 and LRSF_19wip1 are used for 8 ccy pairs each.

Many of the pairs are still waiting for the right time to open positions.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
thanks for the explanations jansb000. and like i said, will continue to test and report back.  meanwhile can you tell me if the EAs released here are capable of trading on a live account?

blam

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Edited after earlier reply...

High blamshakk,

As of version 1.19wip3 I will make sure that each future version can trade on a real account. Just for a limited time of 26 weeks. After that they remain working in demo mode. 26 weeks is plenty of time, seeing that new releases appear well before that time has passed.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #544 ---
hey jansb000. thanks for the reply. can you consider making a version live tradeable after a certain demo testing period with proven positive results?  In case somebody wants to trade that version indefinitely? I've made this point before, about the difficulty of finding decent EAs, and i think this system is a decent EA. regarding the 26 weeks limit, I might want to trade a version live as i am  happy with it, and don't want to necessarily be forced onto the next version. not saying don't continue to refine in the meanwhile, but it seems to me it would be more desirable to have a version system that after being proven for a certain period of time,could be traded live without the fear of expiry. I understand your want to protect people, but to an extent this is trading, and users take on that inherent risk when live trading any system. I hope you will consider my points.

regards, blam

Thanks Jansboo, i've been wondering how to identify a fresh signal from this table.....

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hello Jans,

While I thank you very much for your good effort to improve your EAs and ready to share them with others, may I kindly request you to explain a bit more - how to read the LRSF Monitor to initiate manual trades ? I am a bit confused with it. For example, if all 3 stars (*) are red, then the trend is down. But, at the same time, if TDI is showing - - , and Stoch is showing X -, and HA is showing - X, what should be our action point ?

Please explain.

Thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Good idea. So the WIP versions for demo only and then the final major version for real trading.

For now I will stick to the 26 weeks limit, but I'll make sure that I can re-release older versions.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Keep in mind that this is a very new and recent development. If you see something that you can not explain it might be that there is a bug in the LRSF monitor. So just keep those questions coming. If something is not clear or faulty I will explain it or fix it.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Good question!

The EA uses a number of signals that all must align before it takes a trade. So in general, all signals must give a good indication that a certain condition is met before it will take a trade.

Trading involves the following decisions:

- The direction of the trade, UP or DOWN.

- The best entry-point.

- The best exit-point.

Trend

The trend is measured on 3 timeframes, the current chart-timeframe, one higher and the next higher one. So if you trade on the daily the EA checks the general direction of the price on the D1, W1 and MN1 timeframe. Trading in the direction of the trend is the main succesfactor of this EA. Never ever trade against the trend.

While the trend is going down, the real price at a particular time might go up temporarily, however over a period of <n> bars the average is still down. However, these temporary spikes against the trend are not the best moments to get in a trade. So, besides the trend, we check for a couple more indications.

By following the the trend we solve the first decision.

The LRSF Monitor shows the 3 trends as 3 asterisk symbols (or 3 stars). Blue means up, red means down and white means that we can not determine a trend.

TDI

The TDI is based on the RSI indicator and it gives us an indication of when the price starts to move up or down. The crossing of the red/green will show us the direction that the price seems to be going. We will only trade in the direction of the trend so we will ignore a lot of signals when they do not go in the trend direction.

The crossing of the red and green must be really clear, so we will also ignore crossings where the red and green remain very close to each other.

Do the TDI also gives us a signal about the direction, but when we trade near the crossing of the red/green we also get a signal for the entry of a trade.

Sometimes the TDI appears to make a crossing but just before that happens the green/red are widening again. This is called a continuation signal.

The LRSF Monitor shows either "X-" when a crossing is detected or "-X" when a continuation is detected.

Stochastic

The stochastic is an indicator that tries to predict what the price will be doing on the short term. If the this prediction matches the TDI (and the trend) then we have an other indication about the direction the we should trade in. The TDI tellse us the type of trade and when to enter. The stochastics "promises" us that the price will remain going in that direction for the next few bars.

J1MM came with the idea to also check the stochastic on the next higher timeframe to prevent false signals. This is not built in the EA yet, but the LRSF Monitor shows it anyway.

The LRSF Monitor shows "X*" in the color that it predicts the price will go. The second character gives the prediction on the next higher timeframe. This signal is there for information only.

Heiken Ashi

The Heiken Ashi (HA) indicator is a different way to look at the bars of a chart. Every HA bar looks at the price, but also tekes the previous bar into account. The result is that HA-bars filter out a lot of noise. In a trending market you will see the HA bars nicely flowing up and down. A HA-sequence (a series of HA-bars with the same color) usually lasts between 3 and 8 bars. So if we want to get in a trade we must do it in the first or second bar. Any later increases the risc that the price will go against us.

To make sure that we only take signals that are strong we also demand that the price and HA-bar crosses the 5EMA as well.

The LRSF Monitor shows "X" and a number to indicate the direction of the HA indicator and on the second position a "1", "2" or "-" to indicate the bar-number of the HA-sequence. Only 1 or 2 can be traded.

Conclusion

All these conditions have to be met in a very short timeframe (1 or 2 bars) to be counted as a valid trade signal.

This leaves us with the exit-signal. The TMS-strategy is not very clear about that. Multiple definitions are used by different traders:

- the TDI starts moving against us.

- the HA changes color.

- The price breaks the 5EMA.

- The price breaks the low of the previous HA bar.

- The price goes below a trailing stop.

The EA will handle the exit pretty good so the LRSF Monitor gives no support for that.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Jans, thank you so much for the detailed explanations.

So, we don't have to worry to make manual entries when the market is trending (when we see 3 asterisks are same color),  thereafter the system will take care.

Again, thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Noooo, that's not what I said. With manual trading you want to give yourself the best possible chance on profit. So all the signals should be in your favour. That explaines why the EA doesn't take so many trades per week. If you can choose, choose the pair with the best conditions. After you enter, wait until profit reaches 30 pips and then move the SL to +5pips (the EA will do that for you). Only then look for a second trade.

Trading is not simple, otherwise everybody would do it and would become rich. The LRSF Monitor helps you to quickly see which pairs are interesting to look at for that day. Thats a good starting point. For example if you want to trade the H1 timeframe during the London session and you want to check 28 pairs + EURZAR + SILVER. Thats 30 charts you have to check every hour. That gives you a daytime task. With the monitor you focus on the pairs with 3 stars in the same colour and then patiently wait for the TDI tor cross AND the HA starting a new sequence. THAT's where you enter a new trade.

On top of the LRSF you might want to add your own checks, like the RSI on M5 and where are the support and resistance lines. Believe me, its a lot to check but it will improve your success rate by a major factor.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Nice work Jan. I'm following. Agreed that trading can be challenging and if the signals provided are align with each other, pips can be gained.

A few weeks that i'm trying your EA, then i decide to register in FF.

First of all, i have to thank you for your hard work on this EA. I'm not yet confident with all of this EA parameters, but i will ask for your advise and test them slowly but surely cause i really want to contribute to your work.

Meanwhile, 2 days i'm testing this EA with 30 pairs on 2 different demo accounts, so here is the results.

EA is BiM_LRSF_19wip3 with MA5 crossing and defaults parameters for now

Good point.

Are you able to have both v1.18 and 1.19wip3 on a demo account?. They should both take the same trades!

Maybe there is something wrong. That is why it's only able to run on a demo account until correct operation is proven.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Excellent remark.

The chart is correct. The LRSF Monitor is wrong.

Next version will have a correction. (i am testing it now).

Note however:The LRSF Monitor is updated once per minute, so small temporary variations are possible. The trading, according to TMS, is intended to take place at the very end of a bar or the very beginning of a new bar. So it is possible that you see a difference, but in reality you should look at the last bar but one. For example: When the monitor is set to H4 and you would see a crossing at 14:00 GMT this will not be detected until 16:00 GMT. This is indeed one of the strengths of TMS: Wait for a bar to close. Both of these exceptions do not apply here. So, indeed, you found a bug.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #566 ---
You seem to be right again! For pure TMS all the signals are there: second bar goes down. Stochastic points down and TDI crosses down. Yet the trend is saying UP. So indeed this trade should not have happened. I will investigate.

Cheers...

From the account history you can drag closed trades onto the chart. That will make them visible (again).

The trade lines between entry and exit dissapear when the chart is cleaned, for example by closing it and opening it again or by applying a new template.

Open a second chart of the the same pair. You can attach a different EA to the second chart.

I use two separate MT4 installations to avoid confusion. Just remember to give them different MagicNumbers to keep the trades separate (this is on of the input parameters).

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi nschwegl,

The charts for H1, H4 and D1 are all ranging at the moment, and they move close to the 5EMA due to lack of volatility. That means that they can easily cross the EMA and temporarily indicate a different direction on all three charts. It must be the summer blues with lots of big traders taking holiday to explain the lack of a decent price move.

The advantage of these ranging periods is that the price eventually always comes back, and your trade will eventually come out (maybe with a couple of MEME's).

When I look at the GBPNZD I think you are "in the money" at this moment.
Attached Image

So, in this case the EA worked as designed!

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #579 ---
GBPNZD Week 31 Jul 30 to Aug 03, its is sell only with MEME

Yes. That's what trading TMS with MEME is about and your EA is designed for that... i.e. to make our trading life easy.

Do your top down anaylsis and decide what the Market Type is and it would be easier to decide if you want to be buyer or seller with MEME.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Look at my multi-charts above:

MN is obvious, sideways...trapped between its 10EMA below and the 5EMA above the porice action.

What is that range? I think it is perfect for MEME with 0.25ADR D1 chart

Look at the 800EMA on the D1 above, that is the swing level , which some call that the 'pivot' swing.

So the golden question is when do we cut our losses when we are wrong about selling? Simple, look at the weekly levels... 1.96 and 1.89, above the previous 2 weeks high for sellers and the previous 2 weeks low for buyers.

I closed this month Jul 01 to 27 (20 trading days) with 1407 pips for this GBPNZD pair.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So Folks,

Good Trading folks next week and new August month.

Do your weekend top down analysis and know what the Market Type conditions are and make you buy /sell decision easier.

If it were only that simple, to fix bugs over a weekend. I can only fix one issue at the time and then it must be tested.

For a lot of bugs I must first be able to recreate it on my own systems and then find out what exactly is causing the problem by means of going through the program step by step (the process of debugging). Anyway, I am doing my best .

Anyway, for this GBPAUD trade I think the same is happening as with GBPNZD (see post #578).

Hi blamshakk,

that is some excellent test-work that you did. Unfortunately, I can not explain the difference between 1.15 and 1.15s as I used the same code base for both. But from the test-work from blamshakk I don't think it's just the market that changed. I propose to focus on v1.18 and v1.19 as they seem to do well too.

I will look in my archives if I can find a backup with the original version 15 including all the include files as they were at that time. But I have little hope. Like I said earlier, all the changes I made since then were made for a reason. This could be bug-fixing, risc-avoidance or preparations for new functionality. The main strategy has never been changed. It has always been to mimick trading according to TMS as described in the TMS thread.

Hi J1mm,

I have the "Stochastic thing" now on most of my charts. I am still not sure how it will perform in practice though. Anyway, still under investigation.

I created a class for the "Entry Detection thing" that you posted earlier. My plan is to write a little test-EA to see how it functions under real conditions. I might combine the Entry Detection and Stochastic but then it becomes a new project all together.

So to answer your question: I am still looking at it, but it deviates significantly from the standard TMS strategy. So I am very very carefull before I add anything to the EA before I have absolute proof that it will work. This will take some time...

Hi jdcrux,

this thread is about the development-process for a new Expert Advisor. Not so much about a ready made fully developed product.

Therefore, I promote everybody to use the latest version on a demo account and report trades that went well or wrong. That will help me to find and fix bugs.

Of course you can use older versions in case you want to test special conditions or get an idea of how the EA works.

V1.18 is stable and can be used to get acqainted with this project. V1.19wip3 is the latest version that might have some bugs in it. But for a demo account this would not be a real risc I think.

I was wondering about these little bulges:

Can you say anything about the orders that caused these bulges? Is it orders that you closed manually? Or is this simply a position consisting out of multiple orders that are shown as if they closed with time inbetween whereas in reality they all closed at the same time?

On demo accounts the EA can open multiple trades (maximum one position per pair).

On real accounts the EA will just open one trade/position and then wait until that is finished.

The lot-size can be set in the input parameters.

Hi all,

J1MM and I are going to work on another (very simple) EA:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...2#post11316542

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Thanks, so the EA on a real account will only have one position running at any time?

As for the lot size, i understand the default is 0.02, when attaching the EA to a demo chart and changing it to 0.2 lot on a standard account, trades still open with 0.02 using the newest v18.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Good to know.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hello Jans, pls does this version allow manual trading by the side such that the EA will not take it into consideration while trading.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Yes, trading on the side, manual or by another EA, is no problem.

What Is MagicNumber?
I.e., when an order is being placed (a position is being opened) by an EA, one can assign a unique number to it. This number will consequently be used to distinguish the above order from others. The trading experts must use unique MagicNumbers and manage only "their own" positions.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Yes, the EA does max one position at any time. Note, you can open additional positions (for other pairs) manually, by using the scripts (see post #1).

It should copy the lot-size from the input parameter. I will have a look at this.

Would it be possible to have an unlimited version 1.19wip3 (which is locked to 0.02 lots)? I think the RSI based Recovery makes all the difference and it is not available in 1.18.

Are those results with one operation at a time? Version 18 does not accumulate operations in several pairs at the same time.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
it does only in demo

Hi jansb000, why is 1.18s limited, Everyone is responsible for their live-account. Just trade for 3-5 Euro is boring

See post #1 for downloads.

I changed the calculation of the trend-indication. Will explain this in a follow-up post.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
The next wip version will have the lot-size limit removed. The limit in lot-size is unintentional.

The trouble with trends

Since I made my LRSF Monitor the trend indicator [***] was the first indicator added. Before that it was already part of the LRSF Magnified Price indicator and of course it is part of the LRSF EA where it is shown as 3 rectangles. So, one may think that, by now, this indicator is rock solid and will not change anymore. Well... think again.

Determining a trend is not so easy. The main reason is that when we look at a moving avarage we always look at the history of the price. It's difficult to see what is going on right now! When we look at the picture below you can see what I mean:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The last 2 bars are blue, yet the trend indicated by the MA is still pointing down. This causes that the trend often does not show a break of the EMA5, one of the key signals for the TMS-strategy. Because of this we could miss the best entry when the first blue bar closes.

On the higher timeframes it is a bit easier, there I am happy to just use the direction of the MA. But on the current timeframe, going by the MA does not work because its an indication of the past, not the now. For the current "trend" I will now just check if the price is above or below the MA-5.

Another confusing little detail: According to the TMS-strategy, we always wait for a bar to finish before taking a trade. Up to now I just looked at the last bar (bar-0) to determine the trend on the current timeframe. As of now I will also look at the previous bar (bar-1). So the previous bar must be closed above or below the MA5 and the current bar must still be above or below the MA5. When both bars indicate the same direction then I will take that as the "trend" for the current timeframe. Note that this will allow the correct recognition of a break of the EMA-5. It also means that the best moment for trading is now immediately after the close of a bar.

May be a bit technical to take in, but hey, this is part of developing a good EA .

After a test-period this new algorithm will be transferred to the indicator and EA. For now, please check if the monitor shows the correct colors according to your charts.

Cheers...

New EU-trading rules.

Today the new trading rules for the EU took effect. Having multiple open orders is now costing a lot more (the margin for a 0.01 trade went up from €11 to €36).

This makes trading with lots of MEME's costly on a small account. Trade carefully until you get used to the new regime.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #635 ---
with this version in my live account lotsize 0.02 and now open 0.21 lots EURNZD..........this is crazy

--- 帖子 #636 ---
My question is this: Can v18 be used in real account in multiple pairs with lot 0.02 and also allows to open several pairs at once as the v15s?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
does this version open multiple pairs and is it tradable on a real account?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I am confused. Do you mean that v1.18 opened a trade of size 0.21 while the lotsize setting was set to 0.02?

And for everyone else: People in this thread have asked me for a version that wil trade on a real account. V1.18s will be that version.
However. Make sure that you test every new version on a demo account.

Little bugs can easy break your account. Although I do my best, always verify that a new version does what you epect it to do.

It is your own choice and your own responsibility if you use an Expert Advisor that is still under development.

If something does not work as you think it should I would like you to clearly state what the problem is that you experience and if possible a screenshot or two. In that way I can fix the problem a lot faster.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #640 ---
yes. exactly. v18s2

--- 帖子 #641 ---
On Trader's Way it is more extreme with fixed 0.1 lots yielding 3.5 lots. v1.18s1

--- 帖子 #642 ---
can v15s be used for a live account?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Ok. In post #1 I have uploaded v18s3. Please check if that uses the correct lot-size.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
The trade-manager part will work on a real account. It will not generate new orders like an Expert Advisor.

The latest test-results are not any better then for version 1.18. Therefore, I recommend version 1.18/1.18s.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
but does it operate several simultaneous operations in different pairs or is it limited to a single operation?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Auto trading is limited to one single position at any time. You can add more trades on different pairs manually and the Trade Manager will pick them up too.

Hi jansb000,

I'm a new baby. I'm still learning fx with the demo account. I've been learning BigE TMS5 for over a month. I'm trying your EA. My knowledge of FX is very poor, so I am looking forward to your detailed instructions. Many thanks for sharing your full EA project. You are so kind!

I fully support your ideas and believe your project will be successful.

I have tested your EA BIM_LRSF_18s on some account demo. I will post the results and have the questions. I am looking forward to your help.

Thank you for all

This is a demo account, broker ICMarkets. on 1/8/2018. There is a manual order: 202004686: sell 0.01 lot, EURUSD. What do I have to do to let EA handle this (soft break-even: true/ hard break-even: true/ Trailing stop....). I do not see EA managing the entered commands manually, I have to use the trailing stop of MT4.

Hi jansb000,

I run demo account with broker Portex. 28 pairs, H4 same time with 3 accounts ( run with D1). Perhaps this EA running with H4 Chart will be better when it runs in Chart D1?. The number of orders is very small but the result is profitable. At the time I checked the 3 accounts posted above, the portex account does not have any running commands but the account balance + 9usd. The three demo accounts posted above are all running on D1.

Hi forexhanh47,

Please note: Your broker charges swap-costs AND commission. However the spread seems to be small. Most brokers that I have worked with charge no commission.

Step 1: Read post #1

Step 2: Use the scripts

The magic number can only be set by the EA or a script. Once the order is active it can not be changed.

So for orders that are already open the magic number can not be changed.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #663 ---
The number of orders is indeed not high. May I suggest that you catch up on the TMS-Strategy? The link to the TMS thread can be found in post #1. That is where you can discuss the strategy. In this thread we focus on automating that strategy.

Hi jansb000, yesterday a checked Version 1.18s3 at 15M at demo Modus.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
I checked it, now it works, Next one, I have a Problem the rules of MEME orders. I think if the EA take the order 1-or 2 pips higher then the signalbar, would avoid  bad trades, like this one

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I get that aswell...how did you get it to work now?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
the only Chance you have, check trade monitor Status, and take manuel that trade, I will try this next week at 4H chart

--- 帖子 #671 ---
are you testing on M15 chart?

very few trades on H1

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Trading M15 Charts

The TMS strategy is not designed to work on M15 charts. There is a serious risk that the short term trend M15, M30 and H1 will tell you a direction that is actually not the real long term trend. So there is a serious risc that the MEME orders will eventually go against you.

If you want to trade the M15 I would suggest, besides M30 and H1 to also stay in line with the trend from H4 and D1 to be on the safe side.

The example from nswegl shows us why. Although there is a nice profit of 30,- there is a floating p/l of negative 61,-. That is way to risky. Furthermore, with the new EU rules the margin for all those open orders is huge.

To check the H4 and D1 you can use the "confirm" option:
Attached Image

For the MA Fast you would then use: 80

For the MA Slow you would then use: 480

This is just a suggestion, but I think the risc would be a lot less.

Someone wants to try this on a demo account?

==> This is one of those cases where it would be really

==> handy if the backtesting would work for this EA.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
really weird how backtesting will work some times, and some times not.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hi nschwegl,

My official answer: We follow the TMS Strategy. If you think you can improve that strategy you can post your ideas in the TMS-thread and we will see what the (substantial) user group has to say about that. In this thread I want to avoid discussions about the strategy. We simply take it as a given.

Please read this article about trading strategies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_strategy

One line taken from this article: "A trading strategy can be executed by a trader (Discretionary Trading) or automated (Automated Trading). Discretionary Trading requires a great deal of skill and discipline. It is tempting for the trader to deviate from the strategy, which usually reduces its performance."

I have had these trades many times. An order is opened just at the extreme high or low and then the price goes against you. Well, that is exactly why the MEME is invented. To give you a better average entry point so you can come out with profit anyway.

In version 1.20 I am going to try to implement "The Enzzo" entry method. This method would open a limit order at 60% of the current Heiken Ashi bar. So in your example the price would have to go down (which it usually does after a strong bar) and the trade would have been activated at a more favorable level.

I have used Enzzo's Trade Manager for a while and the results are very good, but you have to enter trades manually. I hope that I can get the EA to use his entry method automatically.

Enzzo's entry method is described in the PDF in this post:

--- 帖子 #676 ---
This is a known error. Backtesting does not work with this EA.

I tried quite a few measures to find the reason for this problem, but never was able to pinpoint the problem in the code.

Now i think I would have to do a rewrite of the code from scratch, and in every step test if the backtest still works.

That would be a major task seeing that we have thousands of lines of sourcecode. Anyway at some point I will have to do it.

Cheers...

Hello Jans,

See attached forward test statement of two weeks with default settings without manual entries.

The result is not bad, though it is not very attractive.

Best part is, it did not create any issues during last week's volatility.

Still, appreciate if you have any suggestions to improve the result.

Thanks and regards,

Profit factor of 2.40, for me that's a bit attractive xD

Would i occur losses or would the EA malfunction if my internet connection was to drop or laptop die ?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi mavilakandy,

Thank you for the test statement. From this statement, and others posted earlier, a picture emerges of a stable basis that makes modest profit without blunders.

You are right that we now can start to think what we can do to optimize the results, without fiddling to much with the basic setup.

These are some ideas that I plan to build in in upcoming versions:When we have a MEME position (consisting of multiple orders) the EA will take its profit at 3 pips profit. So a position of 5 orders would then make 5x3 pips. An improvement would be to keep the trades open for as long the RSI-5 is in our favour. This would make the profit more flexible and not fixed to just 3 pips.

. When a trade goes in our favour, the EA uses several measures to protect that profit, that all resemble some form of a trailing stop. We lock in profit at the bottom of the bars. A better way would be to take profit every ADR(100)/2 (until RSI-5 starts going against as) and reenter with a new position when the RSI-5 tells us that the prices is moving in our favour again. In this case we would find ourselves often taking profit at the top of the bars and we would profit more often from little spikes in price.

. When opening a trade, the TMS strategy says that we need strong bars, but after a strong bar there is often a little retrace, so every new trade seems to go negative first. It would be better to wait for the retrace before we enter. This would give us a better entry point. The Enzzo entry method would be helpful for this.

. When a trade goes really well we should add to it.

. When we get near a take profit, but the momentum is really strong, the EA should move the TP.  Of course every change to the EA will come in its own version and will need thourough testing. So we have plenty to look forward to for the rest of the year.

Cheers...

Hi shay14,

For the Expert Adviser, a permanent connection to the internet is required. The computer needs to be set so that it does not go to sleep! Also, you could make sure that after a reboot MT4 will automatically start.

I have used a VPS for a while, which works ok. But due to auto updates, planned services and system crashes during the week my VPS used to reboot from time to time. So it is essential to make sure that the system does all the steps to restart trading automatically (which is: starting MT4 after reboot).

The TMS Strategy does not rely on a very fast connection, and even when internet goes offline for a couple of hours its usually not a big problem. I use my own LINUX server and I do all the maintenance in the weekend. That works very well.

Cheers...

Hello,

First of all, I have no intention to say that this EA is bad. Rather, I would say that this EA is really good.

Still we have to admit the fact. Maybe, my evaluation or calculation is wrong. You may please correct me if I am wrong.

I am using $10,000 account for 29 pairs. It worked for 17 days with default set up.

Profit on closed trades = $60.93.

Floating loss on open trades = $18.63-

Without considering the floating loss, the annualized profit % on closed trades is = 13.08% (calculation is 60.93 x 100 x 365 / 10,000 / 17).

The annualized profit is further down if you consider the floating loss.

If the account size is small, say $3000, we will have a high profit %.

But for 29 pairs $3000 account is too small.

Please correct me if I am wrong in the above explanation.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Just my observation testing verison 18s on the demo.  On the 1hr chart the entries were spot on but using the default exit did not fare well. I wanted to ask if using another exit strategy like "exit on change of HA color or exit on closing bar in PAC would fare better as the trades using the default exit on breaking 5EMA was taking the trades into negatives well after profit would have been secured if exited earlier. Anyone testing different exit strategies willing to share the experience?

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hi All, we know that the EA is not designed for 15M Chart, despite new Setting 480/80 MA, the result are not sattisfied. I cannot recomend 15M Charts

Hi nschwegl,

You have already a SELL order open and now you try to add a BUY order on the same pair? The EA can not handle this. This is not a MEME situation.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi aleho,

you have the partial close ON. This closes half the order after reaching 30 pips.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #696 ---
And what exactly is not satisfactory about the result?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Have a looking at the "Floating P/L" in the statement!! It is at -21$, while the total profit of closed trades is 29$, that means the currently open trades will most likely lose the whole profit. The equity curve are just CLOSED trades, that is why it is looking so good, as the floating P/L is not in the curve!!

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi mavilakandy,

the EA uses a fixed lotsize of 0.02 which is a safe value for a small $1000 account. That is why the EA takes just 1 position at any one time on a real account. The defaults are all set for small accounts. Consider changing the lotsize to a more appropriate value. For example 0.2. See how that works. Automatic lotsize calculation only makes sense after the Expert Advisor is stable and mature and we can predict how it will perform. I haven't even planned it for any version this year.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi jdcrux,

my observation is that a lot of pairs are currently very flat on the higher timeframes. There are no strong trends. Therefore we will see a lot of trades where there are just 3 or 4 HA-bars of the same color. These trades often end with no or a small profit because the breaking of the 5 ema takes all the profit away. The solution is to go to higher timeframes. In that way there is a higher chance that you will catch real trends. You can also use the confirming moving averages to ensure that there is a trend on the higher timeframes.

Maybe, in times like these it would be better to trade according to the PAC entry and exit. A PAC entry is considerably later then the breaking of the 5EMA. Therefore, A PAC exit without a PAC entry is not advisable. However, from the TMS thread, it appears that the PAC strategy works best on D1 timeframe.

The color change of the HA bar might help you better. This will take the trade out earlier.

==> Read the recent posts from the TMS thread to see how other traders (not using Expert Advisors) cope with this situation.

Cheers...

Thanks for your response.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi all,

lately, many of the questions on this thread are about the EA-part of my program. This EA is intended to be used as an assistant to manual trading. In that sense it is more a Trade Manager with the extra benefit that it can take trades automatically. In the TMS-thread you can read that many have tried to make an expert advisor for the TMS strategy, but time and again it turns out that those who can trade manually make the most profit.

Why make good traders more profit with an EA?Because they know when a trade has run its course and take it out. The EA would keep the trade on until an exit-event occurs. Because they know when to ignore some of the indicators because they predict a bounce of a support or resistance line. Because they know when to take a trade out at a small loss, before it ties your money for days or weeks. Because they know when to re-enter and add to the position. Because they can read the charts like a book. The automatic trading of this EA will most probably never make you rich. But hopefully it can assist you to learn manual trading. There is nothing wrong with using a Trade Manager as it takes a lot of work out of your hands. There is also nothing wrong with using automatic trading, but be aware that your expectations might by unrealistic.

Having said all this: Of course I am determined to beat the system and make an EA that will prove that it CAN be worthwhile. And I appreciate all the help I can get from the readers of this thread. And if a perfect system might be the holy grail and always beyond our reach, I will make this EA, with your help, approach perfection as close as possible.

Hi All,

I have decided that I am going to simplify version 19. The change-list is simply getting to long and the risc that all these improvements will not work correctly is getting bigger and bigger. So the next WIP version will actually be an in-between version (between version 18 and 19). Version 20 will then bring the rest of what is now in version 19. The reason for this is that some of the improvement in 19wip3 are not working well in my tests. Some re-programming is needed.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Jans, quick question.

The EA is not opening multiple positions at same time, but it is opening multiple positions overall right?

I mean, if an entry is triggered at 15:00 for 3 different pairs, it will just take one, but if an entry is triggered at 15:00, 16:00, 17:00 it will open 3 trades right?

Kind Regards,

Jimm

--- 帖子 #708 ---
On a real account: No, for every trade the EA will check if there is already a trade open. So it will only trade one pair at any one time.

On a demo account: Yes, it will take any trade that it can.

Remember the new EU rules? The margin of an 0.01 trade is now approx. €35, and your account will be closed at 50% margin level.

With the trade below I had 1 original order and 2 MEME orders of lotsize 0.02. So in total 0.06. So that was €210 on margin. With 4 or 5 MEME orders on a small €500,- account it would already be necessary to add money to the account to stay alive. So there is simply not enough room on a small account to risc having multiple orders on.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In an upcoming version (19, 20 or 21) I will add an input parameter to enable/disable multiple trades. So on a real account you can then trade the same as on a demo account. If you can't wait that long consider creating groups of currency pair and set a different magic number per group.

Example:

Thanks for the new EA version, but still no joy with the backtest. Error 138 :-( I´ve done some research about this issue and especially when it only comes up in a backtest.

Hi jannsb000, why is it not possible to trade so most liquid pairs, have a look to this pie. instead 28 pairs, most of them exotic and have big spreads. Each Trader should know for each pair Minimum 500€, at 0.01. The founder of TMS Strategie, BigE, trade only most liquid pairs, max. 7-8 pairs

--- 帖子 #712 ---
I'm curious, what does magic number do? How do you use it?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Magic number is the identifier of the order opened by the EA, so for example, if an EA has checks to see if the EA has already opened orders, it will check orders with his same magic number, you can "overpass" the limitation that Jans has put in the EA (Max 1 open order) by just setting up different magic numbers on each pair and they will act as separate EAs.

I hope I explained it correctly XD

This, for example, is very important when you use the "Manual Script" as the manual script V1 puts the default magic number while the enhanced version lets you specify a magic number, if you set nothing and the EA has a different magic number than the script, the EA will not manage the "manual" order.

Kind Regards,

Jaime

Hi Geektrader,

I made version BiM_LRSF_18s5 available in post #1.

This has Slippage as a parameter, so you might try to adjust it. It is default set to 5. If it must be adjusted to 5-digit traders then a value of 50 would solve the problem. Could you please test it?

PS: I found that descriptions on the web of how to setup backtesting (the ones I used in the past) are very outdated now. Can someone recommend a good up to date description of how to do backtesting with 99.9% accuracy?

Cheers...

Hi jansb000,

Thank for sharing your ea. I have started testing from yesterday and so far it has closed all positive trades. It has one trade which is running towards sl but waiting how it goes. I am using the one which you have used for live trading. I might start live trading from Monday. Any specific recommendations?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi nschwegl,

The EA only trades one single pair per chart. You can attach the EA to any chart (= 1 pair) you like. So there is no limit to, or mandatory 28 pairs.

You can trade whatever you like. Even Silver, Gold, Oil, DAX20 or Crypto currencies. It's all up to you.

Cheers...

Hi shg,

I would recommend trading on a demo account for a bit longer. One day with this complex product is not enough to learn how it works.

Let the LRSF EA run on a demo account for at least a month before you take the next step. And even then you might start by leaving the EA on a demo account and decide manually if you want to copy its trades to your live account. (You can setup notifications on your demo account to alert you whenever there is a trade opportunity). In that way you have control over what happens with your account.

Also I recommend to really study the TMS thread. I saw that you already are a member of that thread in your profile. Read from post #1 until you understand how it is supposed to work. Then also try to keep up with the latest posts in that thread to gain awareness of the latest developments like MEME. You will also notice that not every poster is a fan of the TMS strategy (although most seem to support the original BigE method).

Yep, trading with an automatic trading solution is a lot of work .

Cheers...

Greerings to everybody, especially to the owner of this thread.

What a work!

I've been on this forum for 2 years, and never took part in any activity.

Read a lot from original strategy thread, and then somehow found this one.

What a work was done.

To make it short, in a few hours I will set up version 18s5 on my server demo, and will see.

Hope to be useful for this community.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Thanks! Exactly, "50" for slippage (or even 9999) solves the problem, now backtesting works! Will report back once again...

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Just tried a few backtests, but am not sure what exactly this is trading. It does not look like the TMS system that I am trading manually. How can I make the EA trade every cross of the TDI as per the TMS rules? Even if disabling all the filters and profit targets, trailing, etc., it still does not trade every cross. Normally it should enter a trade, hold it until the next TDI crossing, then exit the previous trade and right away enter the new trade in the opposite direction. The EA does not seem to be able to do that?

Thank you geektrader for solving this puzzle. The lack of a backtesting option has been a real bummer. I hope it will now be possible to speed up the development. Of course I have to re-set up backtesting on my own system as I let that slip because it wasn't working anyway.

You are correct, this EA does not take every cross. A lot of other checks are done (not all can be disabled). But we already know that the EA does not take many trades. That was one of the reasons to ask the readers of this thread to publish demo data, to generate more data for me to analyse. With backtesting working I can finally start testing (aka fiddling) with the code to see what will happen if I change the filters.

PS: I thought that the original rules say that one should trade TMS in the direction of the next higher timeframe (i.e. the trend). So "immediately going in the opposite direction" would then be impossible. Anyway, we can discuss this and adjust the filters as needed.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Jans, I have a question. I believe it was partially answered somewhere in the thread. But I need to be crystal clear on it.

To my understanding the default lot is 0.02 only because partial closing is also set to true by default.

Right?

So, if I have a very small account, and I really opened today just a $500 demo, because I want to check "stress" conditions, I can change a lot to 0.01. But I also have to set partial closing to false.

Am I right?

And another one. When I set to false 2nd filter in settinngs, I am just disabling a check on the conditions 2 TFs above.

Say EA is on H1, I am disabling a check on D1, but a check on H4 still in force.

Correct?

Hi jansb000, today this System take 2 trades in a live account, I am happy, or it is a bug ?,

Hi All, there annother 12H Test of 1H Charts, have a look at this exotic pair AUDCHF, next week I will try it, without MEME orders

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I wonder how this will pan out in the next few days.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
I had only one trade so far.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
You can set the lot size to 0.01. That's enough. The partial close will only work with higher lotsizes. It will close: MathCeiling(lotsize/2).

Examples:
Lotsize Partial close size
0.01 ... -disabled-
0.02 ... 0.01
0.03 ... 0.02
0.04 ... 0.02

That is correct!

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Both trades started exactly at the same time. So technically both EA instances didn't see an open trade when they decided that they would open a new trade. So not really a bug, but it's not a wanted behaviour. I have had this 2 times myself and what I do is close one of them as soon as it turns positive. Just to limit my exposure to risc. In any case be very careful that they are not turning into big MEME orders.

In a future version I will try to solve this unwanted behaviour. My plan is have the trade wait for a random amount of seconds (between 1 and 15 sec) so the chance of this happening again is minimised.

With a €2000,- account I would risc to leave them both on.

Cheers...

it's a start. Just let it run for a couple of weeks!

LRSF EA - Autorecover

Did you know that the EA is written in such a way that it will automatically recover from system mishaps?

For example if internet dissappears for a couple of hours. Or when your computer crashes or is switched off during the weekend. Just do what you need to do to fix the problem and restart the computer and then MT4. The EA should still be attached to the charts and after a couple of seconds (1 or 2 ticks) the EA is all ready to continue trading. It will automatically recognize open orders etc, so you don't have to worry about that at all.

Of course when the computer is not online, for whatever reason, it can't do it's magic, so try to solve the problem as quickly as possible.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #734 ---
I will make a couple of simple indicators to make it visible -per filter- what the EA sees. That will help me optimise each filter separately.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Great.

And similar question. All of you guys, have the terminal window look alike.

Mine is different. First, I like it on a white background, then I just added each indicator, changed colors, added an ea, and saved as a template.

Did you do the same, or all of you got a template from somewhere, that I don't know?

If yes, share, please.

I want to be on the same page.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Dear Jansb000,

I used the LRSF - Manual BUY / SELL Order scrip. It's great! Thank you.

Last week, I have tested ea18s3 on 9 accounts. I submit the results report for your reference. General comment: EA is good

Next week I keep running for these 9 accounts and will report you weekly. Do you have any suggestions on the reports please guide me to make

A question for you: what advice would you give to setting EA parameters so that it runs best depending on the spread, depending on the market Sideway, downtrend, strong downtrend ...

I believe in the success of your EA project. You were very kind.

Best regards

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Mr, Forexhanh, I have a question. Almost all of your statements have series of loosing trades, but just in the beginning.

Then everything goes normal.

Was it because you were playing with settings?

And one statement is negative. What was so different with other settings in that case?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hi forexhanh47,

Statement_ 1518723371 (the very last one) is interesting to look at: AUDJPY has a big open position and has reached the maximum number of MEME's and is still going against you. When the price comes near the SL you have to make an important decision:You may decide to do nothing and leave the EA to it. If the SL is hit this will result in a huge loss. All 6 orders will then close with a loss. On the other hand if the price turns in your favour the problem might be resolved by itself.

. You may decide to manually close the first (oldest) order in order to bring the number of MEME's down by one. The EA should then create a new MEME. This situation is not ever been tested as this situation hardly ever occurs. You would do this if you expect that the price is about to turn in your favour but just do not want to risc that a spike would make it hit the SL.

. You may decide to change the EA-parameter and allow it to add more MEME's. For example 8. Again an untested strategy as I never had to do this. You could decide for this if you have enough balance in the account and you expect the price to go against you further before it will go back in your favour.

However, if the price does not turn in your favour you will eventually suffer an even greater loss of (i.e.) 8 MEME's. This is the moment where the EA needs manual help and where it pays if you know how to trade even without an expert advisor.

For myself I have already made the choice if this will ever happen to me. When the price goes against me and comes really close to the SL of 6 MEME's I will close the oldest order and take the loss of that. Of course, at that time I will study the situation at hand and I might change my decision. But in the end, at some point this situation will happen in every account and needs to be handled accordingly.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I do not have a template as such available because I work with higher version numbers for the indicators and EA's. As a developer, I am always one or two versions ahead of you guys. On my trading machine I have a template with just the EA attached. I keep the charts as simple as possible to save system resources.

Would be great if one of you guys would publish a template.

A basic template would include:

- The EA (currently version 1.18s5)

- The LRSF Magnified Price

- Heiken Ashi

- Moving Average EMA5.2

- TDI

- Stochastic

Having a version for black background and one for white background would be great.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
I will upload a template when I get to my computer. White one. I am not using a Magnified Price though, don't need it for ea. And. I see the difference. I was using ma 5 with shift 3. Got the idea from somewhere on strategy thread.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I see a little problem with this, though.

Any template published here will include a personal copy of ea with all chosen options in a set file, made by this or that individual.

For example. I am testing ea on a very small account of $500

So I limited MEME just for three steps, and a lot changed to 0.01

My point is - all future readers of this thread have to realize that, and do appropriate steps.

At leasr check all ea settings, and ajust accordingly.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Following my idea of testing an ea with a tiny account, I have a couple of questions.

I have limited MEME to 3 steps, because I am on vacation, and was able to monitor the very first trade from the beginning to the end. When the 0.02 position was opened broker marging was $80

With 3 opened positions it would be $240

Half of the deposit.

Let's cut it to 0.01 positions. Still a lot. $120

I am not even thinking about 4-6 MEME steps. That would be the end.

Just on one instrument. (Well.... I opened 11))))))

--- 帖子 #743 ---
My question is. This account is with off-shore broker, almost the only one available for US residents. (Others are "unreliable ", if not crooks).

With this broker I can have a leverage anywhere from 1:25 to 1:500

I chose 1:25 just to test this ea in a situation that is legal for US brokers.

1:30   More is not allowed.

So... I am bad with those calculations...

Will the leverage increase to, let's say, 1:500, help the ea to survive?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
The second question is...

I don't know, if any calculations were done.

May be it is better to limit MEME by 2, or even not use it?

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Next question.

Does a sl depend on allowed steps in MEME?

The more steps of MEME I set in ea options - the sl moves further and further away?

And if I choose not to use MEME at all - the sl will be a way closer, just depending on ATR?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Yes, the MA5.3 is used as well by some traders. When you go through the thread (if that is at all possible with more then 4 million posts) you will find several variations of the settings and versions for TDI, MA and STO. Also if you want to trade the PAC you'll find differences. I have simple chosen those settings that seemed to fit best on my charts and then made the EA work with those.

Now that the backtesting works we can start testing what the best settings are, and make adjustments in the software, or per currency pair in the settings.

That is why I now want to make simple indicators per filter to make it visible what they do and do not filter.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
If you can not access your account while on holiday - I wouldn't use the EA. But you should always be able to use your mobile with the MT4 app. Just to cut bat trades short. The margin costs are really high now due to the new EU rules. So trading with 0.01 is actually a good idea. All retail traders must be very careful with their small accounts. This is something the EA can not do for you.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Research has shown: "The higher the leverage, the less profit a trader makes". I used to trade 1:100 but that is now 1:30 according to new EU ruling.

I would definitely not go higher then 1:100. Very risky.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
In the TMS thread, BigE never used MEME. That technique was later added and seems to work oprtimal on D1 charts using the PAC method. I found that on the normal BigE method it works quite well also. On the higher timeframes it works best. "Pure" TMS should also work without MEME, but recent tests have shown that this EA is not doing well. Again, with backtesting we might get the performance better in future releases.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
The SL is ADR[100]/2 away. For every MEME it is moved and the maximum will be 2.5 x ADR[100].

You are correct, if you limit the number of MEME's you will influence the maximum SL. Hmmmm, I have to think about that. In the upcoming version where the MEME's are controlled by RSI the SL is set immediately to its maximum value. Maybe I should do that as well for nomal MEME's (without RSI). Like I said: hmmmmmmm

Any ideas on that????

--- 帖子 #751 ---
my friend,

These are the ea automatic entry and exit commands. For objective results, I did not interfere in the activities of the whole week.

"Almost all of your statements have losing trades, but just in the beginning. Then everything goes normally "I also have this question, Mr. Jansb000 can answer us.

"Was it because you were playing with settings? And one statement is negative. : I set the default values of EA, only change the lot number depending on the amount in each account.

I think the results are different because of the accounts of the different Brokers

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I have reviewed these commands before going to bed on Friday (I'm in the GMT + 7-time zone). However, at the time of my review, prices were supporting all six orders, so I did not do anything. On Saturday morning, I checked again and found that the price was against me but because the market was closed it would wait until the market opened again. I will cut the first command to EA to add another MEME instruction as you instructed.

Mr. Jansb000: Do I need to replace EA18s3 with new EA 18s5?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hallo forexhanh47, what timeframes did you use in your 9 accounts. ?

--- 帖子 #754 ---
all are H4

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Dear Jansb000,

I ask you to explain the meaning of the displays, how to look at it to calculate entry or exit manually: Preliminary I understand the following, please help:

ADR 100: 57 - value of ADR = 57

"The SL is ADR [100] / 2 away. For every MEME it is moved and the maximum will be 2.5 x ADR [100]." In this case, would have to calculate SL = 57/2 = 28.5 pips? to the final MEME, SL = 2.5 x 57 = 142.5 pips?

0.0 ??? I do not understand what information it displays?

* * * ??? (as far as I understand the first star shows the current timeframes trend, the next two stars are the next two trending higher timeframes)

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi forexhan4,

be careful, I only mentioned some OPTIONS that you have, and my intention is only to make you consider your options BEFORE it is to late. If you choose one of those options, or maybe come up with your own solution, is entirely up to you. For me the future of the price is a mistery too.

Everyone using this EA will run into this dilemma at some point. When the MEME does not work and just adds to a loss. Only careful planning can help you to make a decision.

In the last year I had 3 times a situation where the price went against me so far that even 6 MEME's where not enough and I lost the whole trade. As it happened all these 3 situations happened in the same week, taking out most of my account. That's when I decided to change the EA so it would just trade one pair at any one time. I now only trade a second pair when the first position is in profit with a stoploss on the positive side of the trade (minimum 5 pips positive).

Furthermore, from those 3 cases, I saw that the price started to go in my favour shortly after my SL was hit. So taking out the oldest order, or adding one single MEME would have saved me. But there is no guarantee that any of those approaches would work out the next time. In that sense I can not advise you what is the best. I can only share my experience and what I have decided what I will do next time.

For demo trading I would recommend the latest version. For real trading I would only use a version that you have tested thouroughly yourself, or that others have tested and reported good results. Don't trust me! I make mistakes too.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #757 ---
ADR[100] is the Average Daily Range (calculated over the last 100 days). In the past I would have set the SL on a fixed 30 or 50 pips, but I learned that for some currency-pairs this works and for others it doesn't. I think we all have seen orders that just hit the SL and then go in the direction that you predicted. By using a SL that is derived from a currencies own history makes the choice of a SL easier. The initial TP is 2 x ADR[100], for the same reason. I have learned this from other traders in the TMS-thread. For TMS it is handy to always see the value of the ADR[100] in case you want to add a manual trade.

Next is the "Pipsometer". It shows the number of pips that your position is positive or negative.

The 3 stars show the price-direction (trend) on 3 timeframes. Current, Next and Nextnext. (for example H1, H4 D1).

All this indicators are available separately, but I decided to combine them into one indicator to save system resources.

Please browse through the thread from the start. You will find earlier discussions about this topic.

Cheers...

Hi all,

I just finished the very first test-indicator for Heiken Ashi. If you want to test for yourself you can find it in post #1.

The arrows show where the HA-filter is currently seeing trade opportunities. Of course this signal is combined with many other tests. But as a stand-alone ... is this what you would have expected? You might immediatly think - oh but it didn't break the EMA5 here and there. But we don't look at the EMA5. This is just the HA as a stand alone case.

If there is no arrow here, no matter what the outcome of the other filters is, there will be no trade.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What is the meaning of the arrows?

- The arrow means that according the the TMS strategy concerning HA, at the close of the bar, this bar would qualify to start a new trade.

I would like to hear your opinion...

It would be great if we would find flaws in these filters. And, a good discussion will clarify the TMS strategy!!

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Hello Jans,

Will it have any troubles if I replace the latest version (LRSF_18s5) to the old versions while they are in the running stage ? Please let me know.

Also, please see attached my 3 weeks report for 29 pairs and multiple EAs of LRSF, fully auto.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #762 ---
its seems interesting to test at high volatile market...

--- 帖子 #763 ---
No, this is no problem. Why would you want to do this?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Hello, Jans.

Can you make an optimization set, please?

For me the most important to optimize is sl.

Since it's based on ADR, I think, the parameter responsible for the final outcome would be the ADR multiplier/devider.

I realize that this approach requires reoptimization once in a while for each pair, but at the moment it's the most important one for me.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Otherwise, how we can check the performance of new version ?

Also, when it is a new version means, I assume there are some improvement in it comparing to the old version.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Template on White background.

Make sure you check all EA settings coming with it.

They might be different from yours.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Aha, I think your question was if it is possible to move from an older version to a newer version. I thought you meant the other way, from latest version to an older version.

Anyway, you can freely switch between versions.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #768 ---
What exactly do you want to optimise? The SL? In what way? A smaller SL will usually not be better. In the TMS-thread the value ADR[100]/2 has been tested many many times.

There are several processes that take ADR[100]/2 as a basis for setting targets. SL and TP, but also the distance between MEME orders and the distance between price and the nearest S/R line. So, I hesitate to fiddle with this as the whole logic would need to be retested.

Cheers...

The EA does a heap of tests before it takes a decision to trade or not. In the EA these tests are all combined so it is sometimes confusing te explain in hindside exactly why an EA did or didn't do a trade.

The HA filter says that a new trade must start on the first or second HA-bar after a color change.

The TDI filter says that a new trade must start immediately after a crossing of the red and green.

The STO filter (not yet implemented) says that we only trade in the direction the STO indicates.

And so forth for all the other filters. Only when all filters come out good on a certain bar a trade will actually be opened.

With the test-indicators we can see exactly on which bars the signal from individual the filters is active.

I invite the readers of this thread to see if they can find any discrepanty. When we are sure that the filters individually work we can test them all together.

HI all,

May I know what is the best TF for this EA version .18?

Will be testing it on a few common pairing first

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I am testing on H1.

In original strategy it was also H4.

Who knows what's the best

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Please read the last few pages of this thread. Set the parameter slippage to a (much) higher value.

Please let us know if it helps.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
The TMS Strategy focuses on H4 and D1. That is the stragegy that I try to automate in this thread.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
This problem has been reported and solved before. Please read the last few pages of this thread. Post #1 has complete instructions on which version and how to install the TDI indicator.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Yes it looks kinda promising.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Dear Jansb000,

EA running on H4 has more commands than running on D1, so I find that correct?

I think when the filters have hit all the requirements as well, EA decided to place the order. When that happens, EA draws a line and the message on the screen is ok but it would be better if EA added the optional message by sound, email ...

LRSF filter HA v1.00.ex4 shows too many arrows, can you filter it?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Dear Jansb000,

In order for the filter to show fewer arrows, you can program show only the last arrow, deleting the arrows in front of it. When you see an arrow, check the nearest bar, if there are arrows, delete the arrow and show the new arrow. If I'm wrong, please ignore this comment from me

--- 帖子 #787 ---
So you prefer to do a late entry? O_O

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Yes that is what I would expect. The swings on D1 are bigger though.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
This indicator is not intended to be used for manual trading. It just visualises the "opportunities" that the EA sees for this specific indicator. Since the TMS strategy allows to open a new trade on the first two HA bars after a color change we would expect two arrows. This is an indication that this particular filter works correctly.

LRSF EA 1.18s

Hi all,

LRSF EA 1.18s (Bugfixes and changes)

Bugfixes
Inserted Code  * - Bugfix: The function convert_bar() was only designed to convert from a low
*   timeframe to a big timeframe. Now it also supports conversion from a high
*   timeframe like H4 to a low timefrime like M5.
* - Bugfix: The high pips and current pips are now ALWAYS shown with 1 decimal.
* - Bugfix: The RSI check would partly check the wrong timeframe in ntr_check().
* - Testing historic bars on M1 does not always return the correct value. So this
*   check will only be executed on bar[0]. This only infuences checks for past
*   trades and has no effect on normal live trading.
Changes
Inserted Code  * - Do not trade pairs with redicilous spreads.
* - Do not trade pair/order types with redicilous swap costs. This can result in
*   some pairs only being traded with BUYS or SELLS. Because the swap-costs for
*   one trade-type can differ greatly from swap-costs for the other type.
* - Pressing 'shift-d' will now enable to store trading data.
* - Added a detecion of green crossing yellow to cl_tdi.
* - Replaced include "cl_bar_basic.mqh" by  "cl_bar.mqh". The latter is a bit
*   more basic, but has more general functions for recognising patterns. This
*   include is actually now used in the LRSF indicator but not just yet in the
*   Expert Advisor.
* - Created a new function ntr_chk_rsi() That will check the RSI. This code was
*   previously multiple times in the big function ntr_check(). It will also be
*   needed if we want re-entries based on the RSI UP or DOWN.
* - Remove the limit order once profit is locked in.
* - Function orders_count() is now optional ignoring orders with locked-in profit.
*   Use this new option with great care as MEME orders might be counted as
*   positives whereas they should actually be counted as a basket and not as
*   individual orders. For now this new option is not used yet.
* - In do_open we now first check generic and symbol tests before the actual
*   trading tests.
* - Added function position_info() which will determine if profit is locked in for
*   whole positions. This function will eventually replace the simpler orders_count().
*   Its not used right now - needs testing.

Dear Jansb000,

I understand, thank you very much

Your EA manages the commands very efficiently. I like to use it in the No trade, Just monitor mode. If there is an entry or exit message with Alert and Sound, it is very convenient

I thank you very much for the EA that you have shared very friendly on this topic. I have learned a lot of knowledge. Because there are so many ports on TMS so I have to try to read a lot. You helped me very much

Thank you very much.

Hello Jans, i just discovered i would need your EA to monitor some of my manual trades. It's the first time i'll be using a 'trade manager'. Pls, what can i expect from it? Which functions are expected to be in operation? stop loss, take profit, trailing stop? Would it also be active for 26 weeks as well? Thanks for your anticipated response.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hello Jans, i would please need your help to understand how the following work on your EA.... soft breakeven, hard breakeven, hard trailing stop. Or if it's already somewhere in this thread, kindly redirect me. Thanks

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Hi timidave,

best is to try this on a demo account.

The Trade Manager (TM) will handle a manual order in the exact same way as an order generated by the Expert Advisor.

So indeed TP, SL and trailing stop and MEME if that is activated by the settings.

However... The manual orders must be created with the scripts as mentioned in post #1. Reason: Normal manual orders have no MagicNumber (or the MagicNumber = 0). You could set the parameter MagicNumber to 0 and then the EA will manage all orders that have been created manually. But that would include orders that you do not want to be managed.

Like I said. Play with it on a demo account.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hi timidave,

1) A soft break-even is a break-even that gets triggered after a profit of 15 pips has been reached. It will take te order out at less then 3 pips. This is done by monitoring the signal so you will not see a SL.

2) A hard break-even is a break-even that gets triggered at 30 pips profit. It will move the SL to a positive value so your order is guaranteed to make some money. The SL will move to a maximum of +5 pips.

3) A hard trailing stop is a trailing stop that will move the SL every after starting a new bar. The hard trailing stop will be triggered when the SL is moved to a positive value (as described in step 2). The SL will be moved to the LOW of the previous bar if possible.

Cheers...

Hello Hans, many thanks for your sharp and timely response. This is still good for me. I'm trying it on demo first.

Well...

Couldn't be silent at this point. Unfortunately we have a lot of personal problems here with my wife's health. So I couldn't devote any time to ea.

I put it up on a server, and forgot about it.

The results are THE BEST in my life time experience.

By Friday morning it made %4.6 in a week.

Floating dd is almost the same, but it's not the end of the day.

My guess is that 11 pairs is a little bit too much for a $500 account.

Let's see. It's only a demo.

I always remember one thing, though...

$1000 with %1 daily interest is a LOT of $$$

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Hi jansb000, thank you for final Version 1.18s6, but in an live account it is boring only one trade after annother, I will do Multi trades, at my own Risk, what can I adjust

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Dear Jansb000,

I am also running EA on 10 demo accounts (of 3 different brokers). Last week, most orders placed by EA were losses. There are 3 profit accounts of 1.01%, 1.02%, and 1.04%, respectively. The other 6 accounts are all negative and have MEME commands running. I'm still tracking and changing some accounts to EA 18s6.

Last week, I saw the EA entry at the end of the CAD news period so three H4 commands: GBPCAD, EURCAD, AUDCAD were against me. The account I run D1 does not have these commands. However, there are very few commands if running D1. There are no orders in a 28xD1 account (6479502 EXNESS broker)

Thank you Mr. Jansb000

Many thanks in advance,

Hello jans,

LRSF_18s6 and 19wip5 are not staying in the chart when I dragged them to MT4 platform, whereas the old versions (LRSF_18_2 and 15s) have no issues.

The new versions, is it only meant for real account ?

In the left top corner it shows - ERROR: TDI cannot be installed. Please check the screenshot and reply.

Thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #809 ---
hello sir, i got an eror : TDI cannot be initialized

how can i fix this sir?

btw i.am trying on demo acount

The limit of 1 open position is hard-coded and can not be changed. However there is a simple workaround.

I would suggest, if you are willing to take the risc, to setup you charts in the groups as shown in the picture, and give each group a different Magic Number.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #811 ---
1) By that time you should have moved to a newer version.

2) I have to make sure that I don't have to explain problems with old versions in the future.

3) I want to prevent that someone starts selling my software on ebay (as experienced by many EA programmers).

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi jansb000, please can you explain step by step, what I have do do, to make pair Groups, and give them different Macig Numbers. Thank in advance

--- 帖子 #813 ---
You can open 50 pairs, metals, stocks, futures, whatever is available through yuor broker, install this EA on each one, and type in a different Magic Number for each pair in EA settings.

Google it. I don't think Jans has time to answer how to use metatrader, what's ea.....

By the way. I am about to eliminate NZD from my tests. The worst pair. Though they say - a beautiful country.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
What do I get by Setting just monitor / no trade, I tried it at 5M Charts, but Nothing happend

--- 帖子 #815 ---
The EA will always check if there is already a trade open with the same Magic Number. So If you give the same Magic Number to AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, NZDUSD and USDCAD then these pairs will automatically form a group. Within this group only one position will be allowed.

Do the same for the other pairs using one unique Magic Number per group. With 5 groups you can have a maximum of 5 open positions.

Try this on a demo account before doing it for real.

Cheers...

This setting disables automatic trading. Only the Trade Manager remains active.

Hi friends,

I have an update for the LRSF MP Indicator.
Attached File(s)   LRSF Magnified Price v1.18.ex4

If you leave all the inputs default it will behave exactly as version 1.17.

What's new:

Instead of just 3 trends we can now see the trends for a random selection of timeframes.

Example:
Attached Image

This can be controlled by a new input-parameter:
Attached Image

Please notice that on the charts we can have 9 different timeframes from M1 ... MN1.

Therefore there are 9 characters to set. The value of each character can be:

T(rue) - This timeframe is visible

F(alse) - This timeframe is not visible

A(uto) - Timeframe is visible if it is the current, next or next-next timeframe.

Why do you want this?You might like to see always the same trends, even when you temporarily switch to another period. You might like to see more trends then just 3. You might like to see less trends then 3. This is now all possible.

Personally: I like to always see the D1, W1, M1 even when I trade the H1. So my setting would be: [A;A;A;A;A;A;T;T;T]

Please Note:

The LRSF Expert Advisor does not need this indicator. This is purely for your own reference in case you want to open trades manually. However, in future versions of the EA I might add a similar option. But first it has to prove that it is usefull.

Cheers...

Run the EA on a demo account. In Tools->Options you can set your mobile ID for notifications. Every time you receive a notification you can decide if you will take the trade on a real account. That is how I do it.

LRSF EA version 1.19

Bugfixes:
Inserted Code  * - Bugfix: cl_order_basic.find_oldest_order() would sometimes return the wrong
*   ordernumber even from a wrong symbol. This could lead to closing (meme-)positions
*   from the wrong symbol. Possibly an expensive bug.
* - Added a check to verify correct TDI installation.
* - Bugfix: The trend was not always calculated correctly in cl_ma::sigdir().
* - Slippage is now a variable instead of a constant. It's default value is now 50
*   which is good for 5-digit brokers. This solves "OrderSend error 138" during
*   backtesting.
* - Bugfix: The SL of a MEME order was not fixed. The newly introduced "every 5min
*   update" was compensating for stoplevel and would keep changing the SL. Also It
*   would not take the last limit order into consideration, making the SL sometimes
*   closer to the price then the next limit-price.
* - Bugfix: The calculation of a SL or TP for a MEME-position could throw a
*   division-by-zero.
Changelist:
Inserted Code  * - Pressing 'shift-d' will now enable to store trading data.
* - Experimental: When the TDI and HA are giving an entry signal, we go in immediately.
*   We do not wait for other indicators to line up. As it turns out we usually end up
*   with a less optimal entry point with all the extra entry conditions. In this
*   version we will experiment with ditching all the extra logic. This is accomplished
*   simply by commenting the last bit of code in ntr_check().
* - Profitable positions will be closed on friday at GMT 23:45 instead of 23:50. Needed
*   because some brokers stop processing trade signals long before 24:00.
* - Simplified the input variables until volume calculation is implemented.
* - The TP and SL of a MEME position are updated every 5 min. Not just once when a
*   new limit order is activated. This makes it possible to manually insert additional
*   MEME orders and they will be properly processed.
* - MEME orders are now of type "M". Example: LRSF19;H1;M02
* - Shadow-order v_order is now following real order.
* - Add class cl_lrsf_position which can hold and handle all data about an order-
*   position of one single symbol. This class takes and simplifies a lot of code
*   from do_manage().
* - Now allows real trading for 6 months.
* - The EA version number is now kept in a single #define. Easier Maintenance.
* - Small enhancements to function XOrderSend().

LRSF EA version 1.20

In post #1 you can now find the first WIP-version of version 1.20.

This version works only on demo accounts and needs to be tested thouroughly.

With the default settings it will use RSI-based MEME. Would like to get some feedback about this.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Hi jansb000, I tested right now the 1.20 Version, Have look to SL, I think that new, this trade cant go to loss. Is this true,

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Hi jansb000, the Version 1.20 have totally new rules, very promising. The result are better, especially the Setting of SL, Looks good. so I think the scripts of the manuell trade taking must adjusted. Please send this new one. Thanks in advance

Hello Sir.

I am still new in this forum and I like your version 1.19. I am running it on a demo account and the results are good. Could you please make it work forever and not for 26 week because I am planning to use it in a live account linked to VPS. I am planning to test it on a live account with 1000$ and if you want I will share the results here.

Thank you in advance and I hope you will accept my request.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
I think 1.20 will be better for live trading.

It's only my opinion.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I am using those settings with 1.19 and it is profitable for now

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Great Job Jans! What i see apparently is that the EA would be ultimately suited to intraday but mostly swings. The entry is good enough but the exit could be better. and when likely will be the update for the manual buy and sell script as regards version 1.20wip or when it finally goes live?

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Almost the same. Not at my computer now.

But I used 3 steps of MEME and had some losses.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I am also thinking of changing my leverage from 1:25 to 1:200

Scared of a margin call.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
what technique does this EA use?

--- 帖子 #840 ---
I am bad with those leverages, margin requirements....

What is better for a small deposit, who knows? I mean - bigger leverage, or smaller?

Let's say my deposit is $1000 and ea is trading always 0.01 lots.

How is better ? Breaking m5 or TDI and stoch? H1

Hi Zazazaz,

I usually want to see a new version perform under stress. There are not many ppl posting their trade results so I will have to rely on my own testing. It might take another few weeks.

On my real account I am still running with version 18.

On my primary demo account I still have version 19. That is the account that generates the notifications for my real trading.

On my secondary demo account I am now running version 21, that is still under development.

So version 20 is waiting until I am confident enough to move my real trading to version 19, and version 20 to my primary demo account.

Sorry that it takes so long, but enthausiasm has taken a lot of money from me in the past. Better wait until we have proven results.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #845 ---
It is not entirely clear to me why I should make new versions of the manual scripts. Is there something not working with the current scripts?

--- 帖子 #846 ---
There are reasons for the limit to 26 weeks. If you read this thread from post #1 and further you will find them. It is a protection for you and me.

When the 26 weeks have (nearly) passed you can ask me to post a new version 19s. By that time we will know if this version really is as good as we all hope. But my guess is that by that time you will be quiet happy to upgrade to a newer version. The algortihm will stay the same (TMS as described in that thread). But small fixes on entry and exit will make every version more profitable and less risky.

Cheers...

The EA was originally designed for a leverage of 1:100. New EU-ruling has recently limit the leverage to 1:30. I must say that I am happy that my EA still seems to work good with this lower leverage. The margin is now 5 times higher which makes it very expensive to trade multiple pairs simultaneously.

You might want to try higher leverage on a demo account, just to see how it works. Many brokers allow you to change the leverage on a demo account via their website.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #849 ---
It should now be possible to run backtests with and without MEME. That might show you which setting is best.

I definitely would like to see someone doing that.

During the holiday period, without MEME you would have a few losses. Now the big trends are starting again and you might get lucky.

Only a good backtest might shed light on that.

I will continue using my setting in my live account and I will share the results with you. I like how the EA manage the losses. Thank you Jansb000 !!

Hi. In your live account wich technique use ?

Breaking m5 or TDI and stoch? H1

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Hi jansb and all others,

I read a lot in this thread, downloaded some versions and tried them on demo accounts for short periods.

Now, having some space on the VPS, I would like to give something back and help testing an a demo account.

Maybe you some information which tests would be helpful. I am not able to do any backtests but would start

forward tests on demo

Is it right that I use:

- H1 as the timeframe

- Leverage of 1:30

- Version 1.20wip

- Pairs depending on the CPU

Thanks for any hints helping me to start a demo this weekend.

Cheers

Michael

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Hi Atalon,

I use the breaking of the EMA5 and TDI and Stochastic. They must all align. On top of that I use other checks to make sure a trade will go in my favour.

In this thread I have posted about all the checks that I do. By browsing through this thread you will find it.

Can you share your live account set for ea?

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Thank you Bullilulli. Your help is very welcome.

The preferred settings would be:

- Timeframe H1

- Version 1.20 (latest wip)

- Pairs of your choice. Hint: maybe look at the top 10 with the lowest spread that your broker has to offer.

Leverage 1:30 is ok, but is not important. It is best if you report the results in pips.

Testing V1.20

MeMe trades the way we use them, even do now they are working dynamically (Which is awesome) is useless from my point of view...

In my Demo account, in 2 days I created 40% account drawdown to maybe earn 1% if I'm lucky to get a retracement good enough and meanwhile, EA will not open any position in the newly formed uptrend because sell trade still active.

So for now, EA with MeMe is just cuting winners to let losers run, I'm going to test to disable MeMe and reconfigure some other options , let's see what I get...

Would be nice to have a SL and TP dynamic, maybe based on ADR or ATR  as some pairs moves more than others.

Jimm

I live in US, there are not too many brokers available. I mean - reliable brokers. Namely - Oanda, and Forex.com

All foreign brokers do not accept US residents. Some do, but no money can be trusted with those.

The only one that is available is FxChoice. I have my real account with them. And they still give up to 1:200 leverage.

(I am not advertising, just stating the facts).

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Will set up 1.20 on a demo over the weekend.

Will see.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Interesting first results. It shows us that we always have to treat an Expert Advisor as a tool and never as a complete solution. It will always need manual intervention, if you see it missed the trend and goes in the wrong direction it is better to close the position asap even if you have to take a small loss.

At this moment, trades are often taken when a bar breaks the EMA5. This is often a strong bar so the trade, starting at the end of the bar, will open far from the EMA5. Usually after a strong bar there will be a retrace. So nearly every trade will first go negative and then it will either go back up to positive, or it will turn out the strong bar was a fluke and the trend goes in the opposite direction.

In version 21 I am going to introduce a different ENTRY mode that will wait for the retrace. So new trades will always open very close to the EMA5. If the price goes back in our favour we will get a lot more pips. If it goes against us (breaking the EMA5 again) we can come out without a big loss.

I found this idea in another (old) trading strategy:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...10#post5220810

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hi Zazazaz,

statistics have shown that as leverage is higher, the profit is usually lower. With higher leverage comes higher risc and the chance that one tries to win back a loss with one trade (which of course never works). So far, since the new EU rules came into effect I am quite happy with the lower leverage of 1:30. I am not happy with the much higher margin. If I could choose I would never go higher then 1:100. Better invest in learning good manual trading.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Yeah, We already discussed this...

The thing is that the way we use MeMe is just a way to risk more capital for almost no reward.

Of course we can always do manual intervention but this will always be too late.

Now that you included RSI dynamic entry at least it doesnt re-enter in automatically after X pips so now makes more sense, however Ive found situations where this re-entry method was selling every small pullback on a uptrend, I could have cancelled the trades once I have identified this, but I wanted to see how far it could go with the mess

All the people in this post should work to improve the logic and propose solutions rather than just testing without even sharing their set files so we cannot really know what they test.

The EA is for sure one of the bests Ive seen and used with a very robust logic and now Im using the EMA filter as well, but needs to improve the MM piece to get more from the trend and just cut the loser ASAP and not keeping averaging down where the initial analysis is not valid anymore.

You are doing and amazing job and I will always tell you that  I just like to give you my thoughts.

Kind Regards,

Jimm

Here is a statement for the last 2 weeks with 3 steps of MEME.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
There is a very popular system in Russia related to this. Though it's not scalping, more like aiming at 2-4 trades a month, catching only major reversals, but with entries on 1 minute chart. Some guys using tick data. This way loses are terrifically low.

Let me try to explain the idea, without, may be, 2 main parts.

Let's say there is a very big candle going down through our MA.

We know, there will be a retrace. We measure that candle with Fibo.

We put 2 sell limit orders at 38.2

First order takes profit at 76.4

At that moment second order goes to BE.

Almost always second order hits 176.4

Then there are a lot of books written. It may go all the way to 261, or 430

I think, for now it's enough, because at this moment not related to this ea.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
The main secret to that system is missing. If interested - I will describe it later. It cuts off up to 80% of negative results.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Also. The idea, that we look at a bar, that breaks some level, in our case a MA, is great. The problem is -  we are looking at a closing price. In case of a 4 hour, or, even 1 hour bar - that could be a lot of pips.

Imagine the news. Price is jumping.

Now. The solution in a System I am talking about - is analyzing grafics all the way from 4 hour - to 1 minute.

I am not sure any human being could do that.

On, let's say, 14 pairs.

EA - can.

a great idea! I hope to have a better chance on your version 21 entry.

I also find EA's entry too late. This makes the number of pips less.

I am using M15 and M30 at demo account. If EA entry, I will refer to the chart H1, H4, D1 to decide to enter the command manually. Then, the entry will be sooner.

I'm still testing version 19. I'm going to try the 20wip2 version next week.

"In version 21 I am going to introduce a different ENTRY mode that will wait for the retrace." - I'm looking forward to this! Thank you very much.

I use all settings with default value. That's the advantage of being developer .

I trade on timeframe H1 on 28 pairs.

Last couple of weeks I trade on H1. With H1 we get many trades (=good) but we do not use the weekly and monthlty trend and hence we get a lot of MEME's (=bad).

I think I like to stick to H1 charts, but would like the trend check to always include D1, W1 and MN1. In the LRSF Indicator I have solved this with the new trend indication. Expect something similar in future versions of the EA se we can set as a parameter which timeframes we will use per pair.

Backtesting

Now would be a good time to do backtesting, with automatic optimization of parameters. This could reveal what the best settings would be per pair.

Who is able and willing to do this for a couple of pairs with version 18, 19 or 20?

I would be interested to see the results for the default settings and for the optimised settins!

Test data should at least cover 6 months of data.

Hello guys,

I opend a new demo account with AAAFX and no trade opened till now. On the graphs on 18 pairs it shows looking for trading opportunity. Do you think it is because the max spread in serrings is set to 10? Or because there is really no trading opportunity because it is monday? Or maybe it is because of the broker?

Help please

WOW, i asked for backtesting and I am happy to see that I got plenty of results. Thats great.

I do notice that running the EA on H4 seems to be safer that running it on H1 !!!

That is because on H1 the EA doesn't recognise the correct trend. I mentioned this risc before and it seems to be a real issue.

I will work on that a.s.a.p. For now I would advise to only use the EA on H4 or D1.

Also I notice that on many of the backtests the modeling quality is very low, from unknown to approx. 65%. This needs to be >90% to be a little bit reliable. The cause for the low quality is missing data. If you want to make good backtests you might want to google how to do it.

Please refer to posts #714 #721 and #722 for links on backtesting with 99.9% quality.

Optimisation is an essential function in the MT4-Strategy Tester. It allows you to automatically change input parameters and find the optimal setting.

The backtest will run many times with different combinations of settings and the result looks like this:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Every dot represents one test-run. If you hover your mouse above a dot you can see all the settings that where used for that specific run. In the example picture you can see how it might look (but this is a screenshot from the MetaQuotes website). Note that the result are presented in two tabs: Optimisation Graph and Optimisation Results. The latter gives a list of all the runs. Note that you must sort this list manually to get the best results on top!!!

(note that the example shown is a simple optimisation run. With more parameters you get a lot more dots. A complete optimisation run might run the EA 50.000 times and hence will take a long time.)

You can find a full explanation of the optimisation process here:
https://www.metatrader4.com/en/tradi...ion_parameters

So what's the point op optimising?We want to find the best settings for all parameters to give the best results. We want to see what the EA is capable of. We want to see if the EA will kill your account. What will the result look like?

For example we might want to find the best "Break-even trigger" to activate the breakeven. We can then setup the optimiser so that the "Break-even trigger" will range from 10 to 100 pips in steps of 2. There are many settings to play with, and you can optimise all at once or in groups (entry parameters, exit parameters, meme parameters, etc). For example how many meme orders should we allow.

You can select to optimise profit, but also drawdown.

All in all it takes a bit of fumbling and tweaking to setup the system with good data, but the proces is very fun to do and the results might be very surprising. It is also very time consuming (that is why I was asking for help). To find the optimal settings for one timeframe and one currency pair can take a few hours. And the settings for H1 might turn out to be very different then for H4.

It is not necessary (in my opinion) to run the tests for different brokers. After all we are not testing the brokers. We are testing the EA. So stick to one dataset in order to get comparable results. Some guides on the net even suggest one should have a separate instance of MT4 that is not connected at all to a broker. Just use downloaded data from one source. (I use TickStory to collect data - It appears that you must start MT4 via a button in Tickstory to make it use the correct datafile. Anyway that is beyond the scope of this post.).

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #895 ---
This is an interesting problem .

The indicator LRSF Magnified Price is not used by the EA. It is purely for us humans. So the fact that it shows a wrong value is not really important. The fact that the SL and TP are 0.00 is a problem and an indication that things are not well. You can set them manually. Take the trade out as soon as it is positive.

The fact that both the EA and the Indicator appear to use the same wrong value indicates that there might be a problem with your ATR indicator. Maybe there is not enough data for this particular pair to calculate 100 days? Please add the ATR indicator to your chart and see what it displays. (try on several timeframes).

Also your computer might be low on memory? I must guess here as well. The ATR is an indicator that comes with the installation of MT4. Maybe you accidentally deleted it from the Indicators folder? If the ATR is missing then other pairs should have trouble as well.

So you have to fiddle a little bit to find the problem.

Worst Case: Re-install MT4 completely.

Cheers...

Hi guys,

I'm a silent reader of this thread since a longer time and decided to join ff for giving some feedback.

I really appreciate your work and the nice ideas you came up with.

However, some remarks from side. I trade an automated "TMS strategy" with a lot of filters in forward test myself. By seeing the backtests and previous trade reports the huge floating loss/drawdown is a serious issue. The balance/equity curve looks more like an EA a grid system would produce, so I think the MEME component is really dominating and would for 100% kill an account. Can somebody please backtest without using MEME to see the real "edge" of the EA?

Thanks a lot and keep up your good work!

--- 帖子 #899 ---
As I said before, in my tests on demo, I used only 3 steps of MEME.

It still kills all the profit made every day.

Backtests are necessary. Unfortunately I cannot do them right now.

The computer makes a lot of noise while backtesting. And my wife is home straight from the hospital.

I used to test a lot of EAs.

To test on really good server I have to pay for it. Up to 24 processors at the same time.

Dir Jansb000,

i just learn forex few months, knowledge is very limited but i will try to improve my backtesting. Hope I will have better backtesting results to send to you.

Can you post a link on how to calculate ADR 100 in your EA based on the ATR available in my MT4?

I understand ADX 100 on your EA = ATR 100 days on MT4. For example, as ATR (100) 0.0096 (ATR 100 Days) ===> ADR 100 = 96. Do I have anything wrong?

Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Dear Janb000,

I have the first backtesting with optimazation. The results I send as attachments are perfect yet? Can you guide me how to submit the most detailed result report. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
I think you are on a right track.

It's just the purpose of backtesting is to test an ea on a long period of time.

May be a year, or more.

As for optimization - the same story.

The right way to do it, according to the "book", is to optimize it on some time period in the past. For example, from February 5th, 2018 to July 5th, 2018

Then sort the results, best to worse, by clicking on the top of optimization results. Do not close those results. Copy them and save somewhere. I save in Excel.

Then double click, let's say, the best result. Now those settings are automatically loaded in your ea, in your tester.

Now you run backtest, and forward test, by running an ea in your tester without optimization from December 5th, 2017 to September 5th, 2018

See, if you like the results. If not - use some other settings from your optimization table. Until you find what you really like.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Your calculation is correct !!!

Inserted Code    // Average True Range
// We use this indicator to find key values for setting SL and TP.
atr.setup(lv_sym_symbol, lv_tframe, 26, 0);
// Initial value for the Average Daily Range
double lv_adr100 = atr.value(lv_sym_symbol, PERIOD_D1, 100, 0);
gADR100 = NormalizeDouble(val2pips(lv_adr100), 0);
if (gADR100 < gSymbol.get_point()) {
Comment("ERROR: ADR(100) can not be initialised !!");
return(INIT_FAILED);
}

--- 帖子 #904 ---
You would have to read the TMS thread (link in post #1) to learn how to use MEME. Like you say, it should not be needed but in auto-trading it often saves the day. The trick is to decide, when to NOT use it.

The lower the trading timeframe, the more often the big trend will not be recognised, and MEME will destroy your account eventually.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Of course, since backtesting is only possible since a very short while (due to a bug with the slippage setting), we might find that certain design desicions are not selected well and some "corrective programming" might be in order.

I do not pretend that this a finished and stable product. Contrary to that, I am still developing this EA.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Dear Zazazaz,

Thank you for the backtesting tutorial.

Strategy Tester Case

I decided to make an example of a Strategy Tester session. Just to show how it works. I did not download detailed data so the quality of this test is not great (just 45%). I just want to show the process.

First, I had a run of my LRSF EA Version 21. I used EURUSD on H1.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

With this (limited) dataset we can see that the EA made profit, but there was also a big fall due to a big retrace of the price. The retrace was so big that the default setting of 6 MEME's wasn't enough to solve this problem.

So, how many MEME's would we need for optimal performance? This is where the Strategy Tester comes in handy...

I am going to vary the maximum number of MEME's to see what the effect on the test results is.
Attached Image
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You can see that I decided to vary the setting from 0 to 20. At the same time I decided to have the setting for using Dynamic MEME part of the test as well.

The result looks interesting:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It appears that a setting of 7 or higher would give better results than with 6 MEME's as is the default.

In the result-list I sort for profit, and with a right click I copy the settings for a final test of just this single setting.
Attached Image
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now we have a result that looks a bit better. Similar tests with other pairs must verify if a MEME setting of 7 will indeed be better. It also shows that using the new Dynamic MEME with RSI gives slightly better results then the MEME with fixed values.

What next:

For this pair, I would now set the MEME to 7 and start testing with the other settings to see if I can optimise the results further. With those results I would have to decide if I am happy with the outcome. Certain settings may look good in theory but are not good in practice.

This simple test of just two parameters took the better part of a whole night (6 hours) on my old PC. So, doing a full optimisation of all parameters can take a long time (specially on an old slow PC).

Certain parameters have nothing to do with the algorithm and hence there is no point making then vary per test. For example the lot-size is a parameter, but changing this one makes no sense. Same goes for username, magicnumber.

Hope this gives you some ideas on how to proceed with Strategy Testing.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hello Jans,

For the optimiztion testing, shall I put 'tick' mark in all columns, with the default numbers already there ?

Please let me know.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
With a bit of fiddling I got this result:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This was done by switching trend-filter lvl2 => false

Next i'll investigate the impact of the "Confirmation MA".

This will run for approximately 70 hours !!!

--- 帖子 #910 ---
No this is not needed. Just leave them all as they are.

These are settings to abort the Strategy Test. When something goes horribly wrong during the test you don't want to wait for days until all the tests are finished only to find out that after 2 simulated orders your account was already dead.

We are now at a stage where we want to see where the EA goes. Without restrictions.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Proposal for strategy testing

Maybe it would be an idea to co-ordinate the tests so that everybody works on a different set of pairs/parameters.

just before you start a test, you might want to post here exactly what you are going to test, so others know that they can focus on other parameters or pairs.

Note: It is best to focus on a small number of pairs. Because for every version of the EA you potentially want to repeat the tests.

Cheers...

Data Quality 90%

I managed to UP my data quality to 90%. This is still too low, but it will give some directions on the impact of some parameters. To get your data quality UP as well follow these steps:Go to menu Tools Select History Center (F2) Find the pair that you want to test Double click on that pair

-> you will now see a list of timeframes, possibly grey. If it is grey no data is available. With other colors data might be available but it might still not be up to date. Select every timeframe (one by one) and click [Download]. The missing data on your computer will now be loaded from the MetaQuotes website. The data from MQ might be a bit different from the data from your broker. That is why it is best to have a separate installation of MT4 specially for testing.

With additional tools (like TickStory) you can download even better quality data, and your test results will be a lot more realistic.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Dear Jansb000,

I understand.

I will start backtesting under the best data that I can have. The parameter ea will be the optimal parameter. I will check all currency pairs on H4 because I see this should run only on H4 and D1. How do I check backtesting results?

I'm running your EA on a real account (0.01 lot - H4). From the beginning of the week to yesterday there are 2 orders. All are profitable. Take a look at the picture. H4 is a good timeframe for your EA

Hello Jans, well done with your EA, i can see a lot of progress has been made since i last posted here, even though i've been monitoring. Firstly, do you know why the EA does not take trades with my broker; instaforex (i have shared this concern before) where i have a real account. However, i have been testing version 19 on H4 with another broker and it rocks. Over 860 pips made just in a little over a week! This version is very active and profitable and i wish we could stick to it. The only settings i turned off was the 'soft breakeven'. Also, do you still plan to use MM to define percentage risks in lot sizes? That would be a great idea

Dear Jansb000,

Here are the results of GBPUSD H4 optimization: The following 3 items (see photo):

2 / Use hard break-even

Best parameters:

1 / Use soft break-even: false

2 / Use hard break-even: true

3 / Break-Even trigger (pips): 30

I still have not increased the quality of backtesting. Probably because the fxt file data downloaded from MetaQuotes is not good. I will try to load from elsewhere to compare

I would  to be able to do a good backtesting with the data that I downloaded to 99% in order to evaluate the best configuration of v19. But I can not eliminate the error 130. The data are downloaded with tickdatasuite from the Dukascopy server, they should be excellent data, but I insist that I can not perform the backtest without eliminating the error. I have already tried with 100 and 1000 slippage and the same error keeps appearing, which makes it impossible to perform the backtesting.

LRSF EA 1.20 Changelist

The main aim of this version is to introduce RSI to get more sensible entry-points for MEME orders. Not just those on hard "ADR(100)/2" levels.

Bugfixes
Inserted Code  * - Bugfix: In do_manage(), when preparing the next limit-order we were still
*   refering to the old ls_order, but that should now be the last order found by
*   position_info(). Use iPos.get_last().
* - BugFix: In do_manage(), when a new dynamic MEME position opened, the TP and SL
*   where not recalculated.
* - Bugfix: The TP in do_manage() was not always calculated correctly. To fix this,
*   some variables have been renamed so it is clearer which property they represent.
Changes
Inserted Code  * - Simplified the input variables until volume calculation is implemented.
* - Now supports trailing SL based on HA-candles. This is switched on with the new
*   parameter 'UseTrailingHA'. This option for trailing SL is much better suitable
*   for the TMS method.
* - There is now a parameter to enable Dynamic MEME orders.
* - MEME-orders are now created only when the RSI of a lower timeframe is in our
*   favour.
* - For Dynamic MEME the stoploss of orders is immediately calculated for the last
*   MEME, whereas for static MEME the stoploss is calculated per added MEME-order.
* - Class position_info() will now also keep track of the lowest profit value. It
*   already kept track of the highest profit and the current profit.
* - Added function ha_first_bar() that will find the first bar of a HA-sequance.
* - Rename ma1 and ma5 to trend1 and trend5. This is handy to make a distinction
*   between MA5.0 that we use to find the direction of the price and MA5.2 that
*   we use to detect a break of the trend.
* - The function ntr_chk_trend() is introduced. Some code from ntr_check() is moved
*   to this new function. This is in preparation for improved trend-finding code.
* - The correct initialisation of ADR(100) is now tested during initialisation.
* - The method cl_order::is_breakeven_locked() is introduced.
* - When opening an order the notification (on mobile device) will also show the
*   name and version of the EA.

In Post #1 you can find WIP-versions (Work-In-Progress).

After I finish my testing of a new version I publish it in Post #1 so everyone can start testing it on their own system/broker. There might still be bugs so I call these versions WIP (Work-In-Progress). Usually this leads to new findings which I correct. That leads to a new WIP version. Until no new findings are reported.

The WIP-versions only work on demo accounts.

I keep the last 3 WIP versions available just in case someone wants to test if reported bugs are really solved. Once there are no new problems reported I release the "stable" version. This version can trade real accounts for 26 weeks.

Cheers...

LRSF EA V1.21

In post #1 you can now find the first WIP version of V1.21.

This version does a new trick... after a proper TMS signal it will not immediately open a new order, but it will wait for the price to retrace. A new order will then only be opened near the EMA5. This leads to a much better starting position for the order (at least that's what we hope ).
Attached Image

In the screenshot you can see the GBPCAD trade. After 30 pips the first halve was closed and the rest was left to run. I use a MA that is based on the close price of the last 5 bars (runs parallel to the TMS5). After a TMS signal is detected the EA will wait for the price to cross this additional MA before actually opening the order.

Before putting this in the LRSF EA I tried to do this manually but the spikes down are often really fast and I usually miss them because I am not full time behind the computer. Lucky for us, an EA is always watching. The first test results look very promising.

Cheers...

hi, this error on backtesting

--- 帖子 #948 ---
WOW, that is an interesting error. Mainly because the code for calculating the ADR(100) is very simple and does not depend on anything else then build-in indicators.

This is the code for calculating the ATR...
Inserted Code double cl_atr_basis::value(
const string          isym,     // Symbol
const ENUM_TIMEFRAMES itf,      // Timeframe
const int             iper,     // Period
const int             ishift=0  // Bar shift
) const {
return iATR(isym, itf, iper, ishift);
}
And this is the code for calculating the ADR(100)...
Inserted Code    // Average True Range
// Initial value for the Average Daily Range.  We use this to find key
// values for setting SL and TP.
double lv_adr100 = atr.value(lv_sym_symbol, PERIOD_D1, 100, 0);
if (lv_adr100 < gSymbol.get_point()) {
Comment("ERROR: ADR(100) can not be initialised !!");
return(INIT_FAILED);
}
gADR100 = NormalizeDouble(val2pips(lv_adr100), 0);  In the Strategy-Tester try filling a date-range for parameter "Usar Fecha". Without such a range it may start looking for history data in 1970 (and that is probably not present). Please check if you can add your ATR indicator to any chart at all.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)
If this works try to switch that chart to D1 timeframe and 100 periods. See if it looks ok. Post a picture if you are not sure. In MT4 History Center [F2] try to download more history on all timeframes for the chosen currency pair. That is all that I can think of.

A strange thing happens. I download the tickdatasuite data. in this way I get a quality of 99%. with the data of the gbpusd does a backtesting without errors, but with eurusd, cadjpy and usdcad that I have also downloaded the error mentioned in the previous post occurs. so I guess it will be some of the data obtained. this afternoon I will publish the gbpusd backtest because without using meme interesting results are obtained.

hey jansb000

thanks for your reply. in the end I tried it on another brokers demo which i think had more history loaded.

one question, the new feature of waiting for a retrace before opening near the 5ema. Does this need a specific entry method or will it work with all 4 entry methods?

Dear Jansb000,

I encountered this error when running your EA (BiM_LRSF_19) on real account week from 10/9 to 14/9. I stopped running EA.

Also this EA, I'm running at EXNESS broker for 2 weeks, do not see this error

Cám ơn bạn!

Hello Jans,

Thanks for the new version 21.

Yes, we need a bit more aggressive EA and better performance. Hopefully 21 will fulfill that wish. I have replaced all old to new versions now.

Last week it was not good for 18, 19, 20 versions.

Hi forexhanh47,

Thank you for reporting this problem. Unfortunately, from the screenshot, I can not tell what exactly has gone wrong.

In rare cases the EA seems to change the SL between two values. This has been reported before. I have not been able to reproduce this problem with my broker so I can not say what may be causing it. You should be able to see evidence of this "oscilating" behaviour in the journal tab of your MT4 terminal. That might give us more info about what is going on.

What currency pair was causing the problem. How many MEME's where there? Can you make a screenshot of this?

With that information I might be able to add some code to prevent multiple changes in short succession. That's not a solution, but at least it will prevent the orders from being sent to the broker.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Hi jansb000,

an improvement that could be implemented to the system, would be lotsize by percentage of risk, for all those operations that are executed without MEME. In this way the lotsize would increase or decrease depending on the balance.

I use the EA without MEME and it is really interesting, if one could add the risk option per operation, the result would be very interesting.

Hi.

If i have hard trailing "False" and HA Trailing "True", this selection execute trailing with HA Bars or must be activate Hard Trailing too ?

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Hi J1mm,

how would you imagine the parameters to look like?

Maybe:StopLoss percentage of ADR: 50TakeProfit percentage of ADR: 200

That would be possible. The defaults would be similar to what is now hard coded.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Hi atalon696,

Look at sourcecode:
Attached Image

So, HA trailing is only processed if hard trailing is true.

Hard trailing: The SL is moved to a positive value to lock profit at that level. The hard break-even is the first level where 5 pips are locked. After that the SL will move in steps.

HA Trailing: false

The SL will follow the normal bars and tries to lock the low of the last bar that is technically allowed (as spread and stoplevel are concerned). This method works, but is sensitive to small price retraces (=> the order will come out early).

HA Trailing: true

The SL will follow the low of the HA bars (preferably the previous HA bar). As you can see with HA bars active, the low of the previous HA bar is almost never touched again. So in effect you have a better chance that the order stays active and follows the trend longer.

If hard trailing is false, there will be no trailing SL, just a break even. The order will then terminate only when the EMA5 is broken or when profit protection is activated.

Cheers...

MT4 versus MT5

I want to let you know that I have started to make a MT5 version of the EA. So do not expect many new MT4 versions at the moment. For the first MT5 version I will take MT4 version 1.21 as basis.

Differences between MT4 and MT5:MT5 supports more securities to trade. Not just Forex. MT5 is available as 64-bit. MT5 is a larger program to run, but uses all CPU and threads that your system has available. MT5 indicators are more efficient (but different). They should take up less memory. MT5 is still supported by MetaQuotes. MT4 is not actively developed anymore. MT5 strategy tester is much more accurate. MT5 order-handling (in programs) is a lot more complex. MT5 does not run all MT4 programs. Reprogramming is needed. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Something like this, yeah, I prefer ATR to set up SL and TP, but we could use ADR, as you have mention ADR:50 would be 50% of current ADR and ADR:200 would be 200% looks ok for me

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Dear jansb000,

Thank you

Your script is great! Fast and convenient.

MT5 is better than MT4. It would be better if you develop EA running on MT5. I am using MT5, because your EA only runs on MT4 so I have switched to MT4. I am looking forward to your MT5 EA.

Thank you very much!

Please, can you share your setting on your real account?? I have try in my account with 3000€ , but i want a good set.

I use all settings at default.

Please let me stress that this project is still under development, so be very careful with real accounts. There might still be bugs in the EA. You really have to know what to do when stuff does not go as planned. The safest way to use the EA is on a demo-account and manually copy trades that you like.

LRSF EA 1.19_1

This is an updated version that should prevent many many modifications of the TP of a MEME position.

The real bug is still not solved (and not found) but at least your broker will not get upset.

The workaround allows modification of the TP just once per minute.

This bug comes up only once in a while and is not harmfull for your account. But the broker doesn't like more than 2000 changes to one order on one day.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Hi Kadosh, it is possible that there are no trades during 24 hours. That is why I trade 28 pairs. Simply because there is more chance of a trade when you have more pairs. If you know the TMS strategy, maybe you can find an example of where you think a trade should have been initiated on one of your 6 charts. Post it here and we can discuss it.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Hi nschwegl,

good question. Please re-read post #946.

What happens is: A normal TMS trade is detected (possibly at 09:00am *) then the EA waits for a break of the 5MA-close. This happens a bit after 15:00pm**. Note that the middle star is RED indicating a SELL. It's not yet possible to make a distiction between a retrace and a trend change, so a trade is started.

Please note that a SELL might still work out fine in your case. Just wait and see.

Important info:

LRSF EA 1.21 keeps a log of the events * and **. Look in your Files-folder of MT4 and you will find log-files per pair.

It will tell you what happend and at what time.

Please let us know what you find.

Of course this retrace feature is new and might need some tweaking to get the results optimal.

Cheers...

Dear Janb000,

BIM_LRSF 20_1 does not have a MEME order. Is this due to bugs or market insufficient elements for EA to create MEME?

Yesterday I set MF = D1, but because I found the order too late I switched to H4. However, 24 hours have passed, gbpchf has -123 pips, I still do not see the MEME order. What's wrong with EA BIM-LRSF 20_1?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Hi forexhan47,

there is nothing wrong. Version 20 (with dynamic MEME) will open a MEME when the price starts to go in your favour. From your screenshot we can see that the price has gone against your trade consistently since it was opened. As soon as the price starts to go down (RSI will detect this) a MEME will appear.

If you switch Dynamic MEME OFF you will get the old behaviour. (but don't switch the dynamic mode ON/OFF on an already open order).

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Dear Jansb000,

I understand. MEME has also opened. Thank you!

LRSF ea 1.21wip3

I just released the next Work-In-Progress of version 1.21.

Bugfix 1: I had one mysterious position where 5 MEME orders were created very close to each other. Turned out that the first MEME was not quickly processed by broker, and on next ticks the EA send order for MEME again. Eventually all requests where processed and all MEME's appeared at same time. The fix is that there must be at least 5 minutes between the creation of two MEME orders.

Bugfix 2: We know that in rare occasions the SL is changed and then changed back repeatedly. This can lead to "hyper-activity" and the broker might complain. I have build-in a time-delay between two order modifications. So at least 1 minute between two modifications. Further I have added logging messages in every part where orders can be modified. I hope that will show where exactly the hyper-activity originates. The logfiles will be stored in your "Files" folder.

I had to close them because I do not want to have my account blocked. It's my real account. It only happens when the MEMEs are activated. I enclose the record so that you observe that every 5 minutes it makes a movement. At the end of the day there are more than 6500 movements if there are several MEMEs and the broker does not like it.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
Hi atalon696,

I meant a screenshot from the graphical bit. I need to know the open-time and open-price of this order (and the MEMEs that belong to it) so I can model on my own system. With the information that you give I can not start to find the problem.

I will post another version 20 asap that will only change the MEME's once per hour. That should keep you below the brokers treshhold.

This is a temporary workaround until we find the real problem.

Cheers...

Hey Jans,

You need to ask the member to check with their brokers if their account has maximum number of orders allowed. I know that for certain account type and deposit, when the maximum number of orders (both open and pending)  are reached, your get error when you keep sending orders. You EA must handle this error and stop sending new orders.

regards,

Hi emmanual778,

I totally agree. This is a nasty bug that should not happen in the first place. I am looking into this matter with the highest priority!

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
[quote = jansb000; 11522964] {quote} [/ quote]

Dear Jansb000,

You watch this video. Please see when EA modifies stoploss. This is the time when orders are constantly updated to the broker. I set "Use the hard tralling stop" to false then this error will go away.

The latest version (BIM_LRSF 21wip2) also has this bug

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Hello Jans,

I guess this has been answered before but please let me ask again.

Is it possible to use the LRSF Manual BUY or SELL Script to place multiple orders by simply changing the magic numbers to different ones so that the ea automatically manage the trades?

I found out that i can only take one trade on one pair at a time.

Thanks and Best regards

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
My results are rather good!

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
I liked this system... Well let's start it for micro next week.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Надеюсь, что Дядя Коля не придет))))

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
The EA can manage one POSITION on one pair with one magicnumber. A POSITION can consist of multiple ORDERS. You can use the scripts to start a new position or to add orders to an already open position. With this EA all orders in one position must all be of the same type (Buy or Sell).

If you change the magicnumber of the EA you can open a second POSITION on the same pair. But you will need two charts with the same currency and the same EA (but each with its own magicnumber).

The EA will only see orders with the same magicnumber. So the script should provide the correct magicnumber that the EA is looking for.

That is about as clear as I can explain it.

Cheers...

Hi All, how can I copy a trade from Demo Account to Live Accout, new Version 1.20 or 1.21, Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Hi nschwegl,

I have the EA on 28 pairs on a demo account. In MT4 in the tools->options I have set the "notifications" so I will get a message on my mobile when the EA starts a new position. Next I use the scripts to open the same order (if I like it) on my real account.

For this you need:a PC running a demo account with all the pairs that you want to trade and the EA on every chart. a PC running your real account with all the pairs and the EA set to trade manager. a mobile with MT4-app installed on it. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Hello Jans I m getting this notification in my journal which i have attached. I do not know if it has to do with the Script or the EA. I checked my account balance and all is still fine but im concerned about this because im getting the notification on my phone and its a live account. Is there any update to the version 20?

LRSF EA 1.20_3

I finally found the cause of the problem of the many changes to the SL. This update should solve the problem.
This bug comes up only once in a while and is not harmfull for your account. But the broker doesn't like more than 2000 changes in one account on one day.

LRSF EA 1.21wip4

I just uploaded a new wip to post #1.

It contains the same bugfix as descrbed in post #1017.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
Hi jdcrux,

So, you are getting notifications on your phone, but there is no trading going on?

The bug is definitely caused by the LRSF EA and not by the script.

Do you actually have an open order on GBPUSD? Could you post a screenshot?

Have you checked your history to see if there is any recently closed orders on GBPUSD?

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Hi nschwegl,

The automatic trading is limited to one single open position on an account. Once any open order is found (no matter which pair) there will be no more automatic trades until the open position is (a) closed or (b) has more then 30 pips profit (and the SL has moved to break-even).

The trade-manager part of the program can handle all pairs so when you manually add additional orders on different pairs they will still be managed.

This limitation is build in for trading on real accounts as an additional security measure. When trading demo accounts there is no such limitation.

Cheers...

Hi ALL, Version 1.20-2 does not set MEME order like 1.21wip4, see at example USDCAD.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Hi jansb000, often the Profit is in Version 1.21-4 much bigger, than 1.20_2, the most trades I have set manuell in real account. Do you think, that s the reason.

Dear Jansb00,

I have this case: GBPAUD has +69 pips (attach picture). Why does not EA 20_2 close 0.01 lot ? (Usually close to 50% if + 30 pips). Can you explain to me?

Thank you!

The reason is most probably that one account has leverage of 1:30 and the other 1:500.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
The algorithm between version 1.20 and 1.21 changed. Version 1.21 waits for retrace. So entries will not be the same.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
MEME will not save you when you trade against a major trend. That is what happened here.

The solution is that you must manually decide how much loss is enough and then take the order out. 12 MEME's is way to much. With 6 MEME we can catch the normal swings. But if trend changes dramatically then MEME can not save you. When in a higher timeframe a setup in opposite direction is forming one should consider closing the open position. But that is easier said then done.

The current algorithm does not look at support and resistance for its trading decisions. That is why sometimes we miss this important info. This is something that still must be added to the EA.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Hello Jans,

Please see attached forward test result for 3 weeks by using the latest versions: 20 and 21wip, H4 TF, without manual involvement, 13 pairs. It is in (small) profit. Nevertheless, it would be encouraging if we have higher margin. Probably, initiating trades manually is the solution. I already got the script provided by you to initiate a trade manually. But, I do not know when to trigger a trade by looking at the indicators. I know that you have already explained it several times in the past, but still I am helpless.

Hi mavilakandy,

For manual trading the same strategy, why not read the explaination from the guy who invented it:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622

Lately the thread of Trading Made Simple is a bit taken over by some people that mostly shout at each other but the info that you need starts right at post #1.

Without a good understanding of this method, even trading with an EA is dangerous. The most important part is that once a trade is openend the EA will manage it, so you can go to work or spend time with your family.

To get more result from your trades: Simply increase the lotsize. For example 0.2 in stead of 0.02 would give you better results (but also higher risk). Also, trading on H4 or D1 can give you better results because the swings are bigger with less noise. But I am not telling you that this is what you should do. You have to develop your own way to use the EA with a timeframe and lotsize that you are comfortable with. There is no general advise here as every trader has its own preferences. That's why it is so important to understand the trading method in it's basic form.

For me personally: I think the EA is performing consistently and it takes a lot of work out of my hands. The profit margin could be better, but at least we made a start. And I will indeed start a new project in due time with all the lessons learned.

Cheers...

Got a error say ERROR: TDI can not initialized

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Hello Jans,

If we open a position manually in the same chart where EA is loaded, without using the script provided by you, will it effect normal behavior of the EA ?

Means, after doing a manual trade by us, will the EA make further initial trade if it find a trading opportunity ?

Please explain.

Thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Just read post #1 for instructions on how to install the TDI.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Manual trades, without the scripts, will have a Magicnumber of 0. The EA will not see those trades. So you can safely combine your manual trades with the EA.

LRSF EA Version 1.21 changelist

Bugfixes:
Inserted Code  * - Bugfix: UseTrailingHA was not correctly following the Heiken Ashi.
* - Bugfix: At least 5 minutes between two MEME orders. After SendOrder() to broker the
*   order processing could sometimes get delayed a bit. EA would then send a new request
*   on next tick. This would lead to multiple MEME orders at (nearly) same price.
* - Bugfix: Logging added for each modification of an order. Needed to find cause of hyper-
*   activity.
* - Bugfix: Hyperactivity due to many changes of SL is solved. Bug was in the part where
*   trailing previous HA-bar was handled.
Changelist:
Inserted Code  * - Added Entry mode 5METHOD_RET that will wait for retrace before it enters a
*   trade.
* - New function last_order_from_history() will find the most recent -completed-
*   order.
* - Added a status gWaitRetrace to control the logic around retrace detection.
* - Added an include "inc_logging_functions.mqh". This include will store (append)
*   log-messages in a file. Handy for post-mortem to find out what happened and in
*   what order.
* - ntr_check() now deals with retrace signals.
* - Added method cl_order.max_profit_pips()
* - Use variable gMASignalPeriod instead of constant number 5 for defining MA periods.

LRSF EA version 1.22

In post #1 you can now find wip 1 of version 1.22.

In this version we can now set each timeframe we want to check before taking a trade.

The format (with all defaults) is: A;A;A;A;A;A;A;A;A

That is one character for each timeframe: M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, W1, MN1.

The meaning of the characters is:A - Automatic

Use this timeframe in the default way. This is that the current, next and next-next will be checked. Example, if you trade on H4 and the pattern is A;A;A;A;A;A;A;A;A then the timeframes that are checked are H4, D1, W1. T - True

Check this timeframe. For example when the pattern is set: T;A;A;A;A;A;A;A;T Then, in the previous example we would check H4, D1, W1 and M1, MN1 F - False

Do not check this timeframe. Any timeframe marked with an F will not be checked. For example, when trading the timeframe H4 and you do not want to check the D1 then your pattern would be: A;A;A;A;A;A;F;A;A I hope that my little explanaition makes sense to you. If you leave the pattern as the default (9xA) the EA will behave exactly as before.

Here are the result this week Ver1.21_4, very bad.   Have a look to oprn trades !!!  1.21 Version, is now stable ?

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Version 1.21 is indeed stable. That means that it technically does what I expect it to do.

The bad trades in your PDF can not always be avoided because sometimes the market does things that we can not predict. It is up to us humans to cut bad trades short. This is also the reason why during real trading, the EA only alows one open position.

The only thing that the EA is missing, is the proper use of support and resistance lines. That will be my focus for the next version(s). A lot of bad trades (including positions that must be saved by MEME) can be avoided by only trading away from D/R lines.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
hi nschwegl,

The trade that you show doesn't look good. That is true. But the goal of this whole project was to automate the TMS strategy. And the trade that you have did fullfill all the rules when it started. I always said that anyone using this (or any oyher EA) should get to know the underlying strategy first and then use the EA - preferably as Trade Manager - to take some work out of your hands.  As a whole the EA will almost always come out good, but indeed now and again it will make a wrong trade that it can not recover from.

If you see a trade going wrong, and based on understanding the strategy, you should feel confident to overrule the EA and take out a position before it can do any harm. In the TMS thread you can actually find some tips on when you should make that decision. I have been using this EA on my live account for quite a while and i have seen it slowly building on my account. I took out a couple of trade manually over time but not a lot. Maybe three times or so.

The best way to use this EA is to start trades manually and then let the EA (as Trade Manager) manage the trade for you. For best results you can check on the higher timeframes and only trade in the direction that you see there. See my next post for some more info.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Next project is coming!

Hi All,

I have decided that I will give a new boost on my LRSF Monitor. In that manner I want to fiddle with the best detection methods for good setups for new trades. And in stead of doing this in the EA and then wait for weeks or months to find out if it works, I will do this in a monitor that looks at all 28 pairs.

In this way we can see quickly if the indicated opportunities are good.

I have created a new thread for the LRSF Monitor in order to keep this thread clean.

Hello Jans!

Is there any parameter value that I can setup so when MeMe kicks in it just does not close at BE? Like ok, I have to go with MeMe but as I risk more of my account I would like to have a little more in return than just BE.

Kind Regards,

Jimm

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
I would suggest to add more options to get control of MEME (I believe, most of you will not like that) however;

*MEME Multiplier (Martingale effect to get early BE)

*MEME Distance (Current distance seems very high)

--- 帖子 #1088 ---

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
Thanks jansb000 for your hard work on this EA.

I don't understand why suddently it start grid positions and where is this grid distance to adjust? Can you tell us?

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
this is not a full auto trading robot. you must only trade TMS MEME under certain market type conditions.

when you run this using MT4 strategy tester , it will blow up many times.

it will be different when you run this forward testing in live market and trade multiple pairs and you manage the balance /equity of the account. You must only trade certain market type conditions and know when to cut-losses when the market type conditions change.

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
Agree with you friend. I am also fan of TMS since a year but the problem is, I cannot trade manually, hence running behind a fully automatic system with stop loss. I just wish that if we have martingale touch in MEME (with multiplier and grid size) to recover from wrong trades. If failed then take losses.

The problem is, newbie like me can never understand what market is doing right now.  so we can use hard stops of this EA and let it run.

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
Some ideas I have for next release that I think could imrprove the EA performance....

1 - Once MeMe is activated EA will start looking for a fast exit in profit, which means that at the end, you could en up risking a high amount of your account for a small regard (BE+X), my suggestion is to enhance this, once Meme is Activated EA should look for more profit, as you started to average down your position I would like for something like BE + % of the total risked, so at least you feel like the DD held by EA was worth it something more like an exit in BE. Keep in mind that in the moment MeMe trade is activated your initial entry criteria is totally gone, you could be catching a total new trend in the opposite way, and here is when my second idea comes...

2- BUY and SELL, actually when a BUY is active, EA is not taking sell trades, I think that's not correct as the whole point of an EA is that it eliminates our BIAS, when you take a buy, your bias is bullish,if you average down your bias is still bullish, but maybe while you are averaging down you have some signals for sell still, why not to take them? You could gain some pips while it goes down until it finally goes up and you can close the whole trade in profit, it also would be some sort of hedge and maybe it could be an option to enable it or disable it for people that does not have hedging restrictions. so basically EA would be taking BUY and SELLs and managing them independently on the same pair.

Regards,

Jimm

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
there are lot of other things you need to consider when you want to trade TMS MEME.

one of the most important is the market type definition.

TMS MEME will work well in two distinct market types - trending and the wide range sideways market types. It fails when market is narrow range sideways.

study and learn the first key:
https://www.axitrader.com/au/market-...x-market-types

when trading with TMS MEME, you need to consider the market volatility, use a stop loss as your Risk when you plan your trade, then do you trade positions sizing for all the positions in one basket of trades. Remember, it is trading with baskets of trades in several currency pairs of different groups and that is your leverage.

you need to know when to cut-loss when the market condition changes and go against your trade plan.

hedging is not an integral part of TMS MEME but you can trade both ways using different accounts.

managing your account floating drawdowns is important and closing older positions before you average down by adding new ones should be considered. This happens when the swings high-low are very wide and the retracements goes very deep. Manage your Average Entry price of all open positions in same basket.

...more/

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Of course but you can never know if a bearish volatile marker is going to change to a sideways 0 volatibility by the next candle so one you make the trade you need to manage it the best you know.

I dont agree with you that worse market condition for MeMe is narrow range as this kind of market conditions dont last too much and will not hurt your equity as the worse scenario would be dealing with an open position for days. But oh boy if you catch the begining of a trend in a wrong direction you will be opening MeMe trades for the eternity hoping that your equity will last longer that the trend. But if you are able to manage a trade in a way that you still can buy/sell when managing the exit of a "wrong entry" with MeMe thats another story, if you catch a wide ranging market you will be eventually closing all trades in profit, if you catch a trend you are fine, ir you catch the trend wrong you will be hedging a little bit your initial bad trade and increasing the possibilities to survive and if you catch a narrow range you just need to wait next "jump", and if you catch a volatile trend, the actual EA logic would open some MeMe trades and close them at BE making you risk a little bit more of the account for almost no rewards making you miss the pips that trend had to offer.

But well thats just my view.

Hi KashifNawaz,

The EA manages its own TDI settings. The TDI that the EA uses is not visible on the chart.

If you want to add a TDI to your chart for your own viewing pleasure, for example to learn why the EA took a trade, then you have to apply the same settings as the EA does. These are the settings in post #14.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
The EA does have potential. It was designed with a leverage of 1:100 in mind. The timeframe of 30mins is relative short, but it seems to work out nice in your backtest.

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Hi J1mm,

the only settings are:
Attached Image

But they do not apply to MEME. Any MEME position will close at a little more than break-even. The idea was that after a MEME the EA would immediatly open a new position, but I never implemented that in this EA-Version.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
Hi kofix11,

this "grid" is the so called MEME-strategy. The distance is ADR(100)/2. This is hard-coded, or depends on RSI for Dynamic MEME. You can read all about it in the TMS thread. (See post #1 for a link).

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Hi KashifNawaz,

Fyi, martingale has been shown to blow your account. However something could be said to increase order-size for every additional order that the EA opens. And the distance could be a multiplier. However, before starting to do a major overhaul of my EA I would like to see some examples of orders that have been saved in this manner. Not in theory in hindside, but real orders. See, all the strategies in this EA have been hand-tested before I build them into the EA. Small deviations to a working strategy often lead to a strategy that fails. And I don't want to invest my time in untested strategies.

In this thread we had discussions like this before and my answer is always: Propose your idea in the TMS thread and see what the people, who thade with TMS every day, say about it. The TMS method has remained fairly stable over the years. And that is what I have tried to automate with this project. Because of the consensus that it is a working strategy.

In your posts you say that you are a "Martingale/Grid/Hedge Lover". These are all strategies that I try to stay away from. I tried them all in the past and they didn't bring me any good fortune.
Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Hi J1mm,

I agree with point 1. It would be better to hold on to a MEME trade until we have a clear signal that the trend has changed. This will be a topic in my new project.

For point 2 I am not so sure. Hedging doesn't work well in practice. I made an EA in the past that would use hedging, but it often would end up hedging a hedged order and then hedging again, up to a point where the total position was to big to fail and would hold my equity for weeks, sometimes months. This would not work with the new EU-rules. Accounts would simply pop after a few weeks to months.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Hmm... You are totally right, but we are not hedging as usual, we are just allowing the EA to still take opposite orders when MeMe trade is active, once you activate MeMe is to recover a "bad trade", so why not still take other entries while you are recovering that trade? At the point you take MeMe the initial entry condition is over, you know no more what is the market condition, you just take more MeMe trade as per rules, so you could be averaging down a sell trade in an uptrend, I think makes sense to still allow EA to take buy trades, at least you could be getting some pips from this uptrend until downtrend resumes and you can close the MeMe + some buy trades in the meanwhile. Having this as an option to test could make sense.

Kind Regards,

Jimm

Hi,

Will the EA in "Live" only open one order at a time? Keep getting "Open Order Found (Other Symbol USDJPY)" for example, I have the same setting running on Demo and that had 4 orders open at the moment!

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
Hello Jans,

Started backtesting this, GBPUSD not taking any trade, this seems to be a problem or something with the trend filter...

Kind Regards,

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
A ver simple MeMe close approach that can be tested is...

If overall MeMe position in in profit, wait for oposite HA candle to appear. At least you could ride the momentum a bit more and considering we could have multiple positions, a ton of pips.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Hi,

I've been running the EA on demo, noticed at times it enters trades against Support and Resistance ( i have a indicator that auto plots S/R). Eg. AUDNZD H1(Screenshot attached) There is support but EA entered a Sell. Would it be possible  to add additional config to EA to stop it entering trades against S/R.

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
In this e.g sell trade placed by EA with Resistance on top. Which is more likely to work.

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Wanted to test 1.22 but is not providing same results and causing weird behaviour in some pairs, so I got back to 1.21WIP1 and begun properly forward testing it.

Started this wednesday, results for this week:

Some trades closed manually as I want to start clean next week and I was in floating profits.

Hi J1mm,

A new position is started when both the next-higher and next-next higher timeframe support the trading direction. That means that when we trade on H4, both D1 and W1 are pointing in the same direction. In that sense, a retrace on H4 does not change the market condition. The big moves have not changed. When we see that on D1 opposite setup patterns appear then we should consider bailing out. But as long that does not happen we can assume we are in a retrace situation and MEME will give us a better entry point.

In practice, the EA only checks the higher timeframes when we open the first order of a position. After that it is assumed that, because of the conditions decribed above, the market condition is stable for the duration of the trade. The main concern is that the EA does not recognise S/R levels. That can indeed cause trades in a direction that humans would not do. This is still a point on my todo list. The monitor that I started working on will detect this condition.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Hi J1mm,

thank you for testing. Your results are surprising as a WIP version of version 22 has been available for quiet some time. I will look into this, but not now as I have very little time to do programming at this moment.

For the time being I also present version 1.21 with no restrictions.

Hi Unseenhero42,

you have noticed this correctly. There is no support for S/R levels in the EA. I started working on that but then other problems with the EA took higher priority so support for S/R was never finished.

In my new project LRSF Monitor I will include this, and then it will make its way into the EA.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
Looks great!

Tip: The EA is best for supporting manual trades. Do not hesitate to close trades that you do not like. On 28 pairs you should actually check on a weekly basis which pairs you want to trade and in which direction (you can set the EA to only take buys or sells). When a market is ranging the EA can get confused. Simply switch the EA off on those pairs.

In short, even with an EA you still have homework to do. The monitor that I am working on will help to minimise that too, but that will take some time to finish.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Hi, would it be earlier to add fib indicator and if there is a possible trade then EA can check if there is enough PIP distance to next fib to break even before executing the trade. so there is less change of lossing trade if its ends up in the wrong direction.

So now we are sitting at 382 pip profit on a week but 1900 pips in drawdown, I wonder what could happen if we inverse the logic  We could have closed the week in more than 1.5k pips profit...

Have a look at the highest floating profit vs highest floating DD... impressive isn't it?

Hi, would it be possible to add "inverse trade" feature. EA finds good trade but the initial direction is almost always in the wrong direction.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Jans, if you are willing, and maybe would make even more sense to create a different strategy thread, this EA has potential, but it has to work in a very different way.

As I told you so many times, as the EA is currently managing trades is the opposite way it should be doing and the good part is that you "just" have to inverse some conditions in your code. I think that my screenshots and forwards tests proof you that this is not profitable in the long run, it cannot be that every week I test the EA it generates 2k pips Drawdown vs 300 pips of banked profit and in some pairs and 1 year of backtest it blew accounts in the moment you catch a huge trend.

My idea is the following:

- Keep entry conditions as they currently are, I think entries are right, problem comes with the Money Management part.

- Inverse the MeMe logic, don't average down incorrect entries, just average up the correct ones

This would mean basically:

- that the logic for exit an incorrect position would be the actual logic to close a trade in profit in the current EA

- that the logic to average up a trade is the current logic to average down the trade

- that the logic of moving SL to BE would be inverted to move SL to BE but on the average up trades, meaning that you will just exit if trend is not strong enough to keep going up without a major reversal so we will just catch very strong trends.

- Add a basket option, EA will close ALL positions when overall pips are X

Obviously, this is still TMS strategy, but the MM part is greatly enhanced as you will close incorrect entries ASAP but you will let run the good ones for long time until basket is reached.

So in this way, the EA will work the following way...

Entry is activated but it suddenly goes against us by ADR100/2, we close it

Entry is activated and keeps going, first average up is triggered, SL moved to BE+profit

Next average up is triggered, we move SL to BE + profit

This happens for 4 pairs, we reached let's say 1k pips overall profit, we close all

Worst case scenario, 4 trends reverse, they trigger the BE + profit and we exited 4 trades without a loss.

If you want to have a chat, you have my telegram I think you are into something really good here, but needs some tweaking and testing

Kind Regards,

Jimm

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
sounds very exciting. Agree with a lot of the points here. Very good EA, but if we could cut losers fast and let winners run would be great

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
WIP1 of version 22 uses a slightly different entry strategy. After a break of the 5EMA it waits for a drawback before starting a new trade.

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
Unfortunately no. However there is a workaround. The EMA20 on D1 equals EMA120 on H4. And the EMA50 on D1 equals EMA300 on H4.

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
No, this never happened on my account. For every order that is send to the broker the EA always checks if there is already an order open.

The only reason can be that orderprocessing from your broker is slow and the EA sends a next order on the next tick, assuming that the first order has not been accepted by the broker. If this happens more often you should try a demoaccount from another broker.

--- 帖子 #1129 ---
Hmm sounds interesting. What exactly is an expansion zone?

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
No. I always run the EA on a demo account. It will send a notification to my mobile when it opens a trade. Then i'll check if I want to do that trade manually on my real account.

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Hi J1mm,

Your strategy sounds interesting, but unfortunately is not easy to implement in the current code base. We can easily think of a couple of months work.

Anyway, before programming - try to do a few of those trades with your strategy manually. When you make money we can talk about automating the strategy.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Hi blamshakk,

please see my previous reply.

You might not realise it but every improvement I made to this program, from the first version upwards, I first tried with manual trading. Only when I was convinced that it would work out as an improvement I started programming. And afterwards every version was run first by me and then as a WIP version for a couple of weeks before I would risc my money with it.

Improvements seem simple in hindside, but making the right choice in real time, while the trade patterns a forming, is another matter. And there is one simple rule - if you can't do it manually, you can safely assume it can't be programmed.

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Hi jansb000, Thank you for your reply.

What I meant with expansion zone is an "Area of Decison Making"; or a "likely" Reversal Area. It can also be considered as an "Area of interest". For clarity let me call it the "DA" as in Decision Area.  I have been using the DA to look for a trend reversal trade setup when price gets inside the DA. If price goes beyond the DA, then momentum is strong for that trend. The DA is purely in relation to the range of WCC.

I thought that it would be useful to be able to see the DA plot on the chart as a reminder where a reversal is likely. It will be much appreciated if this could be an available option in the settings of the indicator.

Regards

PS Attached are a few screeenshots of the DA's based on the WCC. Notice price behaviour when getting to the DA.

Just wondering why this trade was not taken earlier today by the EA. Contrary to the comments at the top left, TDI seems to be in place

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Hello Jansb000, this settings in the EA; 'enter on retrace break of Ema 5", does it also work well on the 4hrs timeframe or only on 1hr? Will it reduce the number of orders significantly as against the normal settings; 'enter on break of ema 5" because when there's no retrace, we forfeit the trade?

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Another question, pls Jansboo, when i apply the script for buy or sell after placing the 'monitor only settings' on the EA, you know it does'nt ALWAYS fix the initial stoploss. (Or is there something i'm missing?) So, can i do that myself? It seems to me that when i fix the initial stoploss myself, the 'monitor only' settings don'nt work

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
hello friend, sorry for the delay in answering, recurrent neural networks, are: networks that do not use only, forward linear propagation, information is also propagated backwards, which allows to correct several errors that are generated in linear neural networks.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
Seems you are correct. This should have triggered the EA according to Trading Made Simple rules.

I will add this to my "ToDo" list.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
The whole EA is designed for H4, including this setting.

You are correct, if there is no retrace the whole setup will not be traded with this setting.

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
The EA will not change a stop-loss when it is already in place. This is to allow you to manually change it. When you remove the stop-loss from the trade the EA will create a new one. Just try it on a demo account.
