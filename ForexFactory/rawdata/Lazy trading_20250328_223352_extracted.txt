Hi. It's been a while since I last posted anything on this, or any site. The reason is I finally found my system. Plus, I also grew tired of the over inflated ego's of many of those that post frequently. 'Mladen'' on Forex TSD is the very best example of how to do things in a proper manner. Full disclosure of everything he does, all indicaters free &amp; decompiled . This site, &amp; TSD, are FREE &amp; OPEN public sites. Anything posted should be the same. If you want to keep a secret....DON'T TELL ANYONE........that's the moan over with. I have traded the following system for over two years, &amp; it's made me financially independent. I used to fly for my living, &amp; trade for my whisky....now I just trade. I'm not going to bore you with endless pretty pictures of Metatrader charts, I'm sure you are all familiar with them. And I will NOT be replying to any questions. Stick to the system, have fun with your trading, &amp; have a great life. Rule one....... KISS (If you don't know what that means, ask someone.) Clear your chosen chart (I use USDGBP) leaving it blank. Put the MA_color indicator on it : Period :1, Mode :simple, Price : Close. Then Place the: NonLagMA_v7_HIST on it: Settings: Length :5, Displace : -1, Color :1 Unless you know, or know someone who does know how to fix the sound alert. DO NOT USE IT! It will drive you nuts. If you do fix it, please, please post The Game All you should have in your main window, is the 1 period colored MA And in the lower window there should be the Non lag ma. When a new bar opens in the lower window, place your trade in the direction indicated by the colou Attached File(s) NonLagMA_v7_HIST.ex4 17 KB | 2,557 downloads Attached File(s) NonLagMA_v7_HIST.mq4 6 KB | 2,851 downloads Attached File(s) MA_color.ex4 9 KB | 2,344 downloads Attached File(s) MA_color.mq4 3 KB | 2,577 downloads r of that last NonLagMA_v7_HIST bar. This is a scalping system, but also woks well for short trend following. I scalp using a one hour time frame &amp; trade at the top of each hour. Mainly because I like to sleep at night! I'm looking for 3 - 4pips per trade, + the current spread, &amp; I trade £25 a pip. I trade with Alpari in the UK because my unenlightened public officials do not allow spread betting, I'm thinking of relocating. Thats all folks, good trading to you all. – Put a smile on your face, &amp; some money in your pockets!

Hi ComoxBluejay Thanks for the system, looking forward to giving it a try next week. I use an Alpari spread betting account also as I am based in UK. Regards. Martin

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Many thanks Martin.....I normally trade between 09:00 - 16:00 UK time. I like to spend the evenings chatting on Skype, followed by an early night &amp; a late breakfast! Good luck with your trading.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Comox, a suggestion only. What do you think trading only in the direction of engulfs. No changes to the original method, however i.e. longs only if engulfed long? And until otherwise. Makes sense?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi ComoxBluejay, Thanks for sharing. Do you wait until both indicators show the same direction, and have also the same direction of the higher frame, or how do you do it (if the current and higher timeframe give opposite signals)? Best regards, Dragos

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Uh-oh... I hope a few questions will be asked/answered to clarify things.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi ChristianFX There are a number of ways to trade a line chart, what you propose is as good as any. Peaks &amp; Troughs is another, works really well. I cannot comment on engulfs....never traded them. I started using my system just over two years ago, &amp; never found a need to do anything else. Good luck with your trading, &amp; many thanks for the interest.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Dragos, Hi Mary4x I don't wait for anything to 'Match up'. Just trade in the direction of the last bar painted by the NonLagMA. Fire away Mary4x

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Fair enough, thanks

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi thanks for the thread / info. Why so small target 3-4 pips and what stoploss do you use or after how many pips against you do you close out ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #11 ---
So what exactly is the need for the 1 period MA if the rules say that you trade based off the MA histogram at the bottom?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
ChristianFX : No problem, it's nice to be noticed! jgadefelth : Because I scalp. In &amp; out at the top of the hour, £75/£100 an hour. Nico1359 : For when I get bored and switch to P's &amp; T's

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks for the answear, what is your stoplos ? So the strategy would work also on getting more pips ? Any win and lose ratio ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi, I discovered some years ago that stop loss's. unless on a 'Save the ranch' style, i.e 100 pips +, they worked against me. I don't use one. But I hastily add, that's me &amp; is not intended as trading advice. My win percentage for this year so far is 82

--- 帖子 #15 ---
OK thanks i understand but at some point you get out of your position because you have a 82 percent win rate some trades moves against you how and when do you determine to get out ? Please explain for me simple and in detail i am a beginner here. Thanks. Best regards

--- 帖子 #16 ---
TP is easy...if the movement is slow I'll grab 1/2/3/4 pips. make a coffee &amp; wait for the next top of the hour. Sl is a visual thing......If the Nonlag is running the same color as the ma above in the main window, I'll take a chance on the trade returning to profit. Believe it or not it usually does. If I'm trading against the top ma, I'll close the trade at 3/4 pips. If you do some visual back testing you will see that a loss is a rare creature. I also make a point of noting relevant news due out that day, and miss that hour. I like my trading to be painless, &amp; gentle!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
congratulations on achieving the dream life, im glad you made this thread..I myself have helped some people here..id like to ask you a small favour of showing a screenshot of how youd take a sample trade..just to get a feel..thanks and keep up the success

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi guy, thanks for coming through. I don't do screen shots, or account statements. But I'm told there is a company down in New York that copies your trades via an internet connection and an EA. People can then follow your trades &amp; trade with you. I'm thinking of joining them, and anyone can follow the trades. But the system is really so easy you should give it a try for a couple weeks on a demo.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
just a quick question about the MA settings im not sure how i can set the mode to simple and price to close if it only accepts numbers? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Just as they are santos23 : 1,0,0. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Kiss indeed! So @ start of a new hour you place an order in the direction of the nonlagma of the previous hour. No matter the colour of the new developing hour? And do you just place it immediately at the start of the hour, say @ london open the last closed nonlagma was red you enter short?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Here here! Thank for the KISS Comox. If you'll simply verify these settings, here's a simple template to go along with it. I like these colors as their easy on my eyes. Of course folks can change them to taste.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks for sharing your system ComoxBluejay I was just wondering how you would have managed this situation where price reversed -27 pips after entering the trade on the red bar as per my pic, surely it would have hurt trading £25 per pip ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Don't use Line in backtesting. Change this to Candle or Bar and you will see that exactly at 10:00 price was going down on ~18 pips. P.S. ComoxBluejay, thank you for this beauty

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi podberry, Yes...the open was 1.5991, &amp; the high was 1.6026. Draw down would, &amp; did hurt . My records show that maximum draw down was £675. The rewards were a very quick &amp; cool £1000. If your account wouldn't cope with such a draw down........jump out. Always do ' What is best for you '. That's a quote, not mine. But it's worth keeping in mind. Sorry...had a heavy lunch! If you are talking about the first Green bar following the second red.....it was a win trade long before it reversed - open 1.5959, low 1.5040. Again, a nice quick in and out for £150 profit.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Sorry albchr - you slipped through the after lunch haze! All the settings are correct. Best wishes, and good luck with your trading

--- 帖子 #27 ---
If you open the NonLag indi on your chart, hit the 'common' tab, &amp; tick the 'minimum' box &amp; then place a '0' in the window next to it, move across to the 'maximum' box, tick it, &amp; enter '1' in the window next to it....you will have a nice, neat, lower window.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
For when I get bored &amp; switch to P's &amp; T's trading

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Sorry missed you out! Yes you are correct:

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Ok. It's 17:30 here. Need a shower, &amp; out for dinner and night cap or two!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
P's &amp; T's trading, what this meant?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
ComoxBluejay, I really agree with you

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hey, interesting scalping system. Can you clarify a couple of things for me: 1. Are there specific times of the day that you trade? 2. When a new bar forms at the top of the hour, do you trade in the direction of the new bar, or the one that has just completed?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
he has already answered your questions.. 1. London time 9 to 16. 2. trade in the direction of previous bar...

--- 帖子 #35 ---
BlueJay, You trade only GBPUSD? Thanks Blujack

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi folks! Just a quick question as I am doing some backtesting. Does this non-LAG indicator repaint at all AFTER the bar closes? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
im a little confused as to when to get out when the trade is going against you

--- 帖子 #38 ---
P eaks &amp; T roughs http://www.investopedia.com/articles.../02/070302.asp

--- 帖子 #39 ---
thanks sir.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
i think i have corrected the sound alert problem...... now it is set to true or false, if you set it to true it will alert or it will do nothing. ​

--- 帖子 #41 ---
No, but you won't have a immediately previous Non-LAG bar until the current price bar is complete. This is because the Displace is set to -1. The non-LAG will always lag price by one bar. It's tricky to backtest.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
If we put the candles in the chart, we see that the price first dropped 16 pips.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
The problem would be here ...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
i think that was a winner too. enter is at the close of the gray pin bar since thats the 2nd red bar on non-lagma hist.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
You're right. We will have to practice.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Only GBPUSD Bluejack......life is hectic enough. Any more it would be like have two wives!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Correct....but it won out in the end. Stop looking for the holy grail! Draw down is unavoidable, live with it.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Negative sirwolf, no repainting

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi santos23. It's late here &amp; I've had one or two nips. But I'll do my best for you. I nearly always ride out any draw down, but it can get hairy. This is what I did at first, &amp; still do, if the trade doesn't 'feel right'. [ Once the trade turns on you, at some point a bar will form in the nonlag window directly under the current price it will come &amp; go as the price fluctuates....a new bar is forming. If it's a different color to the direction of your trade, get out. It is often a false signal to follow, the trade can turn round again, but you will be saved a heavy loss &amp; you can always re-enter.]

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Many thanks scalper, I'll try it tonight.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Displace -1 means that in backtest we see a perfect winning system if not taking into account that the bars have been moved back by one step

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Wonderful easy. I'm curious to trade this on Demo. Question: " ... always re-enter " means next hour ?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi ComoxBluejay, Thanks for your good job, I just research the recently GBPUSD using the method , and not on the images, there are 13 wins and 7 loses , Will you tell my does my anylysis correct ? many thanks

--- 帖子 #54 ---
This is sooo simple it is ridiculous. Could you just confirm your method for getting out of a loser, I have marked up a chart for this weeks EU, I can only see 2 potential losers, could you explain how you would have treated those 2 situations to minimize the losses, I have presented 3 scenarios 1. Take a hit for 32 pips. Not a good option based on 8 trades @ 4 pips tp / day. Wipes out profits rapidly! 2. Hold until PA comes back, could mean holding for 13 hours, or PA does not come back for days or weeks. 3. Take a BE or -1 pip based on "If the Nonlag is running the same colour as the ma above in the main window, I'll take a chance on the trade returning to profit. Believe it or not it usually does. If I'm trading against the top ma, I'll close the trade at 3/4 pips" In neither of these 2 instances was a close at 3/4 pips possible. I have presented 2 charts 1. with candles so Open and Hi Lo can be seen and 2. Line chart. Just an observation for those who are planning on back testing, on a number of trades the spread would have been absolutely crucial, any hesitation in entering would have turned a number of trades into additional losers, entering at market you would immediately pay the spread and at TP you would have to allow for the BID or ASK to go thru your TP, So in reality a 4 pip TP requires a 6-7 pip move to complete.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
We can demo forward test starting tomorrow, and will see with our own eyes if it is an winning system or not.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Seems like a nice system, once markets open it will be interesting if it works.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I assume it is. As ComoxBluejay is having a win rate of 82 and living the dream. Your results should come out the same, shouldn't it?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
If 82% of trades bring 4 pips profit then how much can you afford to lose on 18% of losing trades? Simple math. I am not saying anything else for now besides the fact that displace -1 is cheating oneself. You just move bars back for one step, and in backtest it seems like you have high winning rate. But let us see how it works in real life.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
If I understand it right we take a loss if the indicators change against us. Otherwise if price moves against us but indicators are still in our favor we hold the trade and wait out the draw down ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #60 ---
You're perfectly right. The winrate alone doesn't make a system profitable ... even a 99% one. It must be combined with the RRR. You can be a loser with a winrate of 99% ... and you can be profitable with a winrate of 1% ...

--- 帖子 #61 ---
The problem is that in this case people should scalp for few pips on hourly TF without hard SL. Which means that if even one candle turns against the trade, all gains are gone.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Dee50 According to your weekly test it may be prudent to trade the setup with a fixed T/P of 4 pips and a fixed S/L of 32 pips, for your test "if" it worked out correctly on a live scenario one would have possibly come out with a net gain in the region of +32-32+32+32-32 which is a gain of "around" 32 pips for the week. Please note this is just basic rounding, spread and comms need to be taken into account. ComoxBluejay would have been up £25 x 33 = £825 on the worst case scenario.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
So basically with this system aka not using a SL you can wipe out your account with one bad trade? Even with a win rate of 82? hmm.. would not be my cup of tea. The hit rate is tempting though.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hit rate is just statistic. If it is 82% long term then it means that long term you lose in average 18 trades out of 100. Short term there is no guarantee that you lose many trades in a row. Traders who do not use SL are the dream of any broker

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I need to rework my maths, on the losing 2 days the losses would have been (+4+4+4-32+4) and (+4+4+4+4-32) which is only -32 pips, so the net gain would have been 3 days of +32 and 2 days of -16. The total pips gained for the week would have been 64 pips .

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I need to rework my maths,

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Who told thee I seek the Holy Grail, Mr. Cocky? What does my message to the Holy Grail? Relax a little, buddy, I see you greatly accelerated! I just made ​​a comment. If you have the answer, fine, and if not, too.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Monday + 32 Tuesday - 4 Wed +32 Thurs +32 Friday -4 So the week would have been up +88 pips, is that correct ?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Where did you get these numbers? According to the system as described you take 7-8 trades every day. Every win is +4 pips. Every loss is -32 as you put it. For covering only one loss you need 8 wins.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Why would a loss be -32 pips ? I did not read this from threadstarter anywhere ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #72 ---
It was a rule created by podberry for doing his calculations. According to threadstarter, there is no hard SL at all.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yes that is also how i understand it you get out when the position moves against you it can be some pips like 4 as the target or it can be when the indicators have turned against your position and that is alot more pips i think. Best regards

--- 帖子 #74 ---
On the Tuesday as per DEE50's pic the system would have won 7 x 4 pips and lost 1 x 32 if you have a hard s/l of 32 pips, net gain of -4 pips, same for the Friday. The other days would have been 8 x 4 pip winners =32 pips Making sense now ?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
It is just one week. What we should be interested in is the possible result for at least 6 months. But even with that calculation it is very much trouble for nothing. To sit behind the charts 5 working days for 64-88 pips?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I agree, I just worked out the pip count for discussion, not saying it will work continuously week after week.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Good systems use RR ratio at least 1:2. You should risk less than is your target. Otherwise, your account will be killed sooner or later. Most often it is sooner

--- 帖子 #78 ---
32 Pip Stop Loss. NO WAY. The thread starter does not use a stop loss. I chose 32 pips for illustration purposes "only". If you read my post I was asking the thread starter how he would minimize the potential losses for the 2 potential losing positions and I just presented 3 possible scenarios as examples. So please get rid of the notion of a 32 pip stop loss, it is purely fictitious.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
DEE50 used the wrong pair. GPDUSD only, he clearly stated that several times........................

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Everyone should do his due dilligence when taking a trade with this system. Exits can be managed with other systems as well... All I can say is to thank ComoxBluejay for sharing his approach.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Dee, keep calm, I am not suggesting a 32 s/l, it is purely to work out the net gain as per your pic that's all buddy Lets move on

--- 帖子 #82 ---
That was the point. No SL means that the risk is infinite ... risk of ruine (or at least to give back the pips earned) is 100% soon or later. No matter the winrate %.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
No SL is killing anyway.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
The threadstarter had a mental stop loss where he get out of the trade he did not use a hard stop loss shown on chart. Atleast this is the way i understand it.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
For gods sake.!! The thread starter trades GU only because "life is hectic enough. Any more it would be like have two wives!" If you are scalping for 4 pips you can trade anything even your grannies bloomers would yield 4 pips.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Mental stop is as good as mental trading system. No specific rules, just discretion. It can work for a very good and experienced trader. Just 99,9% of traders are not that good.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I dont think you can place a stoploss knowing at what price the indicators turns against you thats why he has a mental stop so when he see this then he gets out. Best regards

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Where is the problem to close the trade at the described point ?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Yes I agree ... as long as the trader has an hard strong mental like said Indrek.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
And the nonlagma ... lag

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Wow! It only took one day for this new topic to be torn to shreds. ComoxBlueJay outlined what he does in order to earn a living from forex. If it works for him then that is awesome and I congratulate him on finding a method that works. I am sure others will continue to describe why his method won't work, and that is meaningless because ComoxBlueJay stated it is working for him and that is all that matters. Maybe others will find something useful from this method and be able to apply it to their own style of trading. I don't understand why anyone would be willing to share what works for them publicly when so many are standing by waiting for the chance to rip it to shreds. 1greyfox

No one will believe this, but the TP and SL will make no difference to the final profit. Test 1,000 trades with a 4 pip TP and a 10 pip SL. Then test 1,000 trades with a 4 pip TP and a 100 pip SL and you'll get the same result. The win % will vary greatly but the profit or loss will be the same.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
ty comox

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Please explain more what you mean ? And also what the end result will be ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I can't explain what I mean any more than I have. The placement of the TP and SL will not matter over a large number of trades. I don't know what the result will be for this system as I have not tested it. If it is not a profitable system the result will be the number of trades x spread. With a spread of 3 pips, over 1,000 trades it will lose 3,000 pips.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Two years of forward testing is worth more than all of your opinions combined. He essentially has a system which is borderline profitable but has adapted it with discretionary stoploss and takeprofit to bring it up to profitable levels. Kudos to Commox. I notice that the NonLag indi seems to smooth out the moves like a moving average. This would keep you in the direction of the trend but you will get killed when it ranges or whipsaws.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thank you ComoxBlueJay, simple things in life are sweet cheers hannele

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I agree with what you say. As long as the system is profitable for the person he should not be bothered with what others say or think or believe.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Well said Don, I guess the proof of the pudding will be when everyone fires up their platforms tomorrow morning to test the strat, it will show it's true colours with regards to being a great find or not due to the clear entries, I guess we have no reason to doubt Commox until proven otherwise. It's just when to pull the plug on a bad trade that may catch many out as the exit strategy is not defined.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thanks ComoxBluejay for shearing your trading method. I have been back testing it this morning and found that it works. I've been trying to trade forex for 3 years now and have spent a lot of money on trading methods, I've learned a lot about indicators but I haven't made a hole lot of money. Something I've learned for me is not to be greedy when I do the big dogs but me back on the porch. I'm going to give your method a go this week and I will let you know how I do.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
How right you are. My original intension was to post, &amp; let those that could use it, use it, and those that failed to fail. After all, it really could not be any easier to use, &amp; to make money with. When I finally got my head around this trading thing, I saw just how easy it is to win at this game. I even traded the quarter &amp; half hour bars on 15 min TF! I shall not be posting any more here, any questions PM me. If I do not reply for a few hours, it's because I'm making money, not talking about it! Some people never see the light. Take care &amp; make pots of cash.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
This is another myth that costs traders hundreds of hours. A forward test is a backtest. If today you made a backtest of 100 days, it would be the same results as if you had started a foreward test 100 days ago. At the end of the foreward test day, when you log your results, it is already past history. It is a backtest of that particular day.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thanks for your thread i see if i can understand it after i reread it sometimes and then maybe pm you, we will see. Thanks and have a good day. Best regards

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I think that this system cannot be backtested unless using a trade simulator. Because the entry is upon a NonlagMA bar that is just opening. At hindsight we do not know what color it was at the open, we only see what color it was at the close. So, let us see what forward test will show.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I wrote a crude EA to attempt to backtest and the nolag bar repaints as the current price goes up and down.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Tomorrow Testing will show the result.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
i think not. if that was the case all those fancy indicators systems would work and we would all be rich. capische?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I have no idea of the logic of what you're saying.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Everything works on a still chart, you have to do it live..thats what im saying

--- 帖子 #113 ---
That is only true if the system uses repainting indicators (including MTF indicators). If it does, you shouldn't be looking at it anyway. Forget it and look for another method.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
You have completely missed the point.....you trade in the direction indicated by the last bar painted.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Everyone understands how to open a trade with this system, the problem is how and when to get out of a loosing one. Despite the explanation given by comoxBluejay , no one really figured it out: when and if he will be interested to share more details , then this will become very interesting. let's hope!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
No, I have not. If the indicator has the setting of "displace -1" then the last painted bar is, in fact, current bar that has just opened. By this setting you have moved all the bars forward by one step. When displace is set to 0 then current NonlagMA bar is under current candle. From the point of view of visual backtest, displace -1 is same as repainting. You never know at hindsight what the color was at the time.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
You have moved the bars back by one step. The last Nonlag bar will be two bars back. It will represent the last completed price candle. It doesn't matter except in backtest. You have to be aware of the Nonlag you should be looking at.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Yes, moved back or forward, it depends on how to read it But I understood that we have to trade the very last painted bar, not the very last completed bar. And if it is so then we take the trade based on with what color the bar opens. And the color may very well change later, so in backtest we do not know what it originally was.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Seeing the way this thread was going, this post actually took longer to appear than I thought it would. Can't wait for market open to give your method a whirl. I'll keep you posted via PM.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Same here Chris.. Trolls are on a role here..

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I have to admit brother, I think this is the most conversation over the easiest method I've seen yet. .... I especially like the "how or when do we exit a bad trade" one. Hope you're well my friend. Long time no talk.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
x marks the loser. See how we perform with live data. SL, like the man said if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen looks like "sometimes" we will have to eat 30 odd pips drawdown to get 4 pips, how are your nerves, holding on for an hour or 2 for 4 pips.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Agreed but we can only make money forward testing - not back testing. With that kind of thinking Warren Buffet isn't a good trader he was just lucky forward testing his strategy for the last 50 years? Maybe when he has been at it for 100 years that will mean something.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
losses are part of the game, as long as they dont exceed your wins. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Well said! Very simple philosophy, but as in many cases, there are always those that never get it.

So now discussing ideas, having a point of view, an opinion, a sane debate, is trolling?, then why is the purposse of a forum?I believe that as long as you can debate an idea without insulting is very healthy for anything in life, It enriches the debate It doesnt deteriorate it.

well at £25 a pip I probably wouldn't care.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
25 pounds per pip is equal to what in USD? How many lots per trade? Thanks

Cheers ComoxBJ, really looking forward for our test drive tomorrow, might run 2 pairs to test, your GBP/USD and EU. By they way, any reason you chose GBP/USD over EU, I would have thought the EU trading costs are lower due to spread and comms giving more profit when having such small t/ps ?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I'm glad you said that. I was looking for any kind of troll postings and didn't see any.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
My short answer. You have no control over your keyboard here in the forum and you answer each question. And you're a successful trader? End of transmission.

Da fuk?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
The pro traders often have very simple systems, this is a prime example of such. Trading FX does not have to anything super duper special like all those paid courses try and teach you. Just want to say thx to Comox, for posting something no non sense! The way it should be, cheers!

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I agree with you except that ... The pros do not come here to FF. And much less share his way of trade.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Commox, 2 Questions: 1/ Do you trade when there is upcoming news or just keep on going with the standard place a trade every hour? 2/ Does your broker allow hedging? since you don't use SL, wouldn't your trade be cancelled out when you see an opposing signal? (unless you have the ability to hedge) Thanks

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I just tried it on 5 min , it is repainting!!! repaints on 15 min also.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Out of interest, which bar is repainting?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
the bar marked with a down arrow repaints. does ComoxBluejay mean he trades in direction of the bar that is left of the one marked with the down red arrow? This thread seems a little trollish, no offense. I hope that it's legit and we all gain some pips.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
If I understand the method correctly, on a 1hr chart and with the nonlag histo set to comex parameters, at the close of the 1 hr histo bar, trade in the direction of that bar. The new current bar will continue to repaint due to price action up until close. This then becomes the new bar., remember the time parameters that comex trades between.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I don' t know what you call "Repainting". This is not a colour change during a period, but after close. I tried it with an 1 min (!) chart to get more signals and made 7 (5 + 2) pips in about 10 minutes. No repainting. I exited when the colour changes within the period like ComoxBlueJay said.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
The bar with the arrow is actually the current bar as there is a -1 displacement in the parameters. I don't know the reasoning behind this.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Looking at the bar action changing colour I am starting to get reservations but will keep an open mind for now.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I am not as smart as most people but I think it would be easier to remove the -1 displacement and just state use current opening bar or previous closed bar. Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
You are right.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
all you have to do in this system is enter at the last colour bar..and still theres confusion

--- 帖子 #148 ---
There is no confusion at all Santos. As you may not have gathered the last coloured bar is the current opening bar.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
excuse me sir..why is your status "a son of God" ?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
9am results GBP/USD +4 EUR/USD (testing) +4

--- 帖子 #152 ---
until the close of the current bar the previous candle repaints... but don´t worry that repaint

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Without getting in to religion here -We are all born "a son of God" but depending on which path you take in life it will become a reality or make you a son of Satan. In regards to this system there is no question that it doesn't work as I use to trade a similar hourly system but for more pips.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Yup. It's a good job the system didn't start until 9am, as 8am was red, then went green and went 25 pips the other way. Be careful out there peeps!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Who Knows, perhaps your right... how many trades have you taken to draw to this conclusion? Take a trade from any system and it starts as a 50/50... What you do next makes the difference... And as it happens, it worked ok this time around.. all be it on demo and up near a pivot.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Set displacement @ 1 and you can use the bar beneath the current candle.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
The hourly system I used before used the last closed bar whereas this system appears to use the current bar. What I use to do was wait for a small retrace then jump in. It wasn't producing enough pips for me so I gave up on it. I am always looking for new ideas hence why I am looking at this thread.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
It doesn't use the current bar. Have a re-read through Comex first post.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
"When a new bar opens in the lower window, place your trade in the direction indicated by the colour of that last NonLagMA_v7_HISTbar." Indeed it is the current bar especially when you consider the -1 displacement.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding all the questions about "which bar" to go by? If the settings are correct, you can only go by the last No lag bar painted as there is no "current" No lag bar under the current 1H stick. Seems simple enough to me.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I'm a son of my mother and father, are you telling me they are Satan?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The nolag signal bar used in this system is in fact the current bar displaced 1 place to the left.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Is correct.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Here's a little EA + the mod indi for the lazy sons of Satan as me. it uses the previous closed candle(-2) not the actual (-1) forming new candle.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Yes, I understand this. Hence making it the "last bar". It's just Symantecs. Trade in the direction of the "last bar" painted.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
IMO ... the problem here is when we have a loss can be very painful

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I am not even going to try explaining this to you as if some people can't understand -1 displacement how will you understand what I said previously

--- 帖子 #169 ---
The -1 displacement bar becomes the signal once it close's, however as it close's it steps 1 further place to the left due to new-1 bar starting. That's what I'm seeing.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Well of course we always need to apply proper money management and common sense no matter the "system". IMHO using simple SR is also a plus. As I'm just testing this on my live account and just for monitoring purposes, I mark the 1H stick I open the trade on and then watch both my SR levels and the NOLAG bars on lower TF's like the 30M or this 15M here. I find this helps to determine whether to hold or not. Of course just starting this so we'll see.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
There´s less than a handful decent pepole here. You guys are fucking idiots.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Intresting maybe aply the same thinking when determen target instead of the orginal 3-4 pips ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Watching the NOLAG and my SR levels, this 30M/1H close will be key for me to either hold or bank this trade. SL is already at BE+3 so no loss possible.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Testing too ... and I see that the last bar ... changes a lot. As an example this last nonlagma bar on EU ... opened red = sell But during the last hour ... changes a lot from red to green and now ... the bar closes green with -20 pips Not for me ... but good luck for you guys

--- 帖子 #175 ---
A 30M close below the SR. However, it's "leaning" with long pressure and since it's a free trade anyway, I'll let it ride. But it could (probably will) fall off a bit first even if it continues north in the end. Just an example of how I look at things under any system. Have a great day folks and a green week to all.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Nice little pop there. SL now BE+10 and headed for the next 1H SR. Currently +32ish as I type.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Very nice done

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Not too shabby good work albchr cheers hannele

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thank you folks. This first one worked out quite well. SL now +20, target 6160 and will let it play out either way. I "may" fudge that stop a pip or two as it's actually a little over the 30M SR here. We'll see what the 15M says.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Backed off the SL to +14. Might get whacked but still a win. EDIT: SL hit .. +14

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Well done. Made nearly the same trade (+12).

--- 帖子 #182 ---
This is where (for me) discretion may be the better part of valor. The NOLAG is red and the 1H gave a little pin. But I won't enter short "right away". SR "suggests" it could continue up a bit so I'll watch it for at least few minutes first.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Nice ...

--- 帖子 #184 ---
With this type of in and out system, I'd be inclined to bank "home runs" of 20+ pips when I seen them. It is after all a scalping system, meant for high stakes. That 32 pips you were up would have equated to £800 ($1289) for the OP, and no doubt there will be painful trades along the way to deal with.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Absolutely true. It is a scalping system and I could have banked more. But for me, if it's a free or already in profit trade I default to let it run. Ya never know. I still think 6160 is possible but maybe not. Had I put any serious money on it like the OP, I would have banked it around 30 or so. But just testing it here. If it pans out to be a nice entry system, I'll raise the stakes. EDIT: As it is a scalping system, moving to BE+ quickly "should" avoid much of the potential pain. Unless it runs against you as soon as you enter and then of course, get out quickly based on each individual's risk appetite.

3 minutes.. 4 pips.. G/U..

--- 帖子 #188 ---
the non lag is repainting running on h1 on my platform, so one might as well toss a coin at bar close and hope for the best. a simple myfxbook by threadstarter might put it all to rest. but i cannot see this making pips.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Made my first trade with this on E/U off the 1HR chart. I placed a short, pretty much right on the hour as the Non-lag MA indicator showed a red bar for the prior hour.... then 5 minutes later that prior red bar changed to green??? Is it necessary to wait a few minutes and not trade directly on the hour?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
With TS 3.5 pips, 15 min, 16 pips..

--- 帖子 #192 ---
albchr, Thanks for the template. Would you share your SR indi? I too like a clean chart and the indi I have makes a mess. Thanks

--- 帖子 #193 ---
So Far. The indi Repaints terribly so back testing is impossible other than on a simulator with replay data. The repaint occurs at least 2 mins after the bar has closed. You "have" to take notice of PA as Albchr has suggested, to filter the entries. Moving SL to BE "quickly" depends on your broker, check your brokers "contract Specification" Menu "view" click on "symbols" look for your pair, click on pair, click on "properties" look for "stops level" that tells you how many pips in profit before you can move to BE. If you trade like the OP "at the top of the hour" for 4 pips, moving to BE will not work. It will only work if you let your trade run. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Sorry guys for not seeing all the prior posts before asking my last question. The displace -1 means that the"prior" bar of the histogram actually corresponds to the current candle. Not sure why one would set it like that. The tendency is to look at each candle and then look down at each one's corresponding non-lag MA bar, so if it is displaced -1 that means that each histogram bar represents the candle immediately to the right and NOT the candle directly above... Is that the correct assumption?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
OP says he trades till 4pm London time.....does that mean you close your last trade at 4pm London...or enter your last trade at 4pm? question to OP

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Some of the questions that people ask on these threads simply challenge my version of reality. When a person posts their "system" or "idea" or whatever, there is always a flood of questions like "what is your TP?" "what is your Stop Loss?" etc., etc. OMG...what freakin DIFFERENCE does it make people???? Take the info that is shared...put your OWN parameters on it...and see if it works for YOU! If it works then GREAT...if it doesn't then it doesn't. I swear it wouldn't surprise me if someone asked if it's "OK to drink water while trading this method"....or "at what time of the hour can I go to the bathroom"...."what color underwear should I wear to trade this method".... Seriously....some of these questions are just straight up IGNORANT!

entries are good, I have been testing today (when I had time) and all entries with TS = 3.5 have closed in positive. (5 trades). using SP = 25. I think the SP maximum would have to be 10 to -10 or run or use SP Hedge and out alive as possible ...: p

--- 帖子 #208 ---
well, first of all, attached is a nonlagMA histogram that DOESNT repaint. secondly, I would caution against using just a shifted MA as an entry trigger. Without going too deep into it, its just eye candy, people. As another poster already said, you can use it all you want, but be prepared to eventually realize you are simply coin flipping.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
so basically this thread starter has been coin flipping for over 2 years? and become financially independent? that's interesting man...that's f€ng interesting. **subscribed**

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Sorry but how do you know all this? In an anonymous internet forum? Everything we really know is what we can see on our charts and what we can figure out in our brains.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I think we need to keep the strategy in perspective. It's is using the nonlagma at the top of the hour to scalp up to 4 pips. Whether it paints or re paints is not really that relevant. It's the signal (color) it provides on the hour that is the trigger, not at the end of the hour. I see this as a way to capture the surge in direction on the hour and 4 pips is not a big stretch. It is what it is - but with care it can work.

Here is a brief summary of comments from comox. Brief because there was absolutely no need for many comments. Look at a chart and work out why he is going for only "4 pips" on a 1 hour chart, note he has never referred to 5,6,7 pips only 1,2,3 &amp; 4 pips. I freely admit I was slow off the mark, probably because I was looking for the "catch". There is no catch. Work out what your pain threshold is, if it is low, figure out how to minimize the loss and move on to the next trade give it a couple of weeks on demo and by then you should have fine tuned so that you are making regular profits KISS. Lazy Trading method.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I like your idea to exit trade. perform the operation every 15M? or each 1H? and then switch to 15M for output?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Enter on the hour as normal, if the trade does not go in your direction after 15 min drop down to the 15min check out PA and make a judgement call get out or stay in. You may take more losses this way but limit the losses to 3 per day or a number of pips maximum and you may live to fight another day. I have not worked it out exactly, if we could back test I would have worked it out so for now I will continue to forward test and see what works best. I suggest you do the same.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
+4 pips now on G/U.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I perform the following test, entry into every hour emergency SP = 15 pips, TP=15 pips, TS = 3.0 if you have not hit TP, TS or SP in 15 minutes, close by your method.

Read your own response again and you will realize that this can't work. no sl profit only 4 pips Maybe you have good weeks, months, with luck some years. But one day this kind of trading will destroy your account. One unexpected big news or disconnections....

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I do not ordinarily respond to Dick Heads who if they can not make it as part time traders will surely have a future as comedians. But for the benefit of those who are interested in at least exploring the possibilities of this method. If you analyse todays chart you will see that if you entered promptly the draw down on each trade would have been minimal, even if you were a little late. The only dubious trade was number 4 which was a Long in a down trend, however if you believe in Patterns there was a likely BPC and a HTF 123 which increased the likelihood of price coming back and hitting TP, which it did, must have been pure luck because it could not have been good judgement Oh and before all the Dick Heads jump in, yes this is only 1 day but that is the point of forward testing for a couple of weeks, "before" writing it off. Demo trading costs nothing but time, nothing is being sold here so no one is being "scammed" and even if they were, I personally do not need "protecting" I have been around long enough to take responsibility for my own actions and I actually find it insulting that a bunch of semi literate morons think that they are more intelligent and more capable than I.

On one hand i agree(that there are scams) and on another i don't. There are really some intelligent people ho posted their trading setups here in FF. Take an Udine's example ('00 trading). People blamed that it is not working, having SL to TP at 2:1 ratio and etc. But who really get into these systems they make money, not complaints in forum. We should really be thankful to Comox, as patience, discipline, grinding and perfect money management are the only way of making money in scalping.

That does not really say much. If you do like the threadstarter and go for 3 - 4 pips pr trade that will be around 20 pips profit for the 6 winners and again if you do like him and have no SL the 2 loosingtrades can end up in margincall. But lets say you are lucky and get out with only 10 pips loss pr trade you will end up with zero. You break even. From your post i understand you made profit right? But with no SL that is only luck. Maybe you use SL?

I have read the thread. And i have also read many other forums and threads so i have seen people have come up with something they say is a "mental stop". And for some strange reason a lot of people seem to think that is a better stop. But i say a mental stop is no stop loss at all. It do not exist. If you enter a trade with no stop loss and your computer break down, you loose power in your house or you loose your internet connection or something like that you will end up with a margincall if the market fly away from you in the opposite direction of your trade. There is nothing you can do. You will not even know it before after it is all over. Even if you are online and all is good the market can fly away from you before you can do anything about it. Maybe you was just looking away from the screen for some seconds. This things do not occur very often but they DO OCCUR from time to time, and when they do you can be sure Myrphy is there with you. He is always there. But anyway, good luck with your "mental stop" and good luck with your account the day you need your mental stop. Happy trading. Arctic4x

Hi Everyone, I've tested this system over the last couple days and can say that yes, the system outputs more winners than losers. The only problem I'm having is, as expected, the SL. I can win 6 trades but then lose it all with one loser (which losers will happen with ANY strategy) so my question is simple, How do we treat the SL? I'm not here for a debate or rant or any of the nonsense that's been going on above, just some helpful information. Hope to hear from someone with something helpful and sensible to say. Regards,

Draw Down chart for today. I am using this information to guide me on a realistic SL, so I am looking for maximum Draw down, today if you were 2.5mins late entering on trade number 6 max draw down could have been 18 pips, at present I am using a 24 pip hard stop but managing the trades manually. TP is hit on average, so far, within the first 5 mins if it is not hit then I am looking down at the 15 min TF and even the 5min to get an idea as to what is going on. This is why we back test and/or forward test to assimilate this sort of information. BTW the 24 - 25 pip SL was actually suggested by other traders here, some have PM'd me and others have already stated this on the thread. It makes sense. The thread starter uses a mental stop but has traded this method for over 2 years so is familiar with all the signs and warnings, I would suggest that people use a hard SL, for now, until your forward testing proves other wise. This should shut up the Doubting Thomas's. I doubt very much if any one will have identical results unless they are using the same broker on the same server. To trade this method I changed broker to Armada Markets. They have a UK based server which has reduced the lag on my connection considerably I am down to 71ms from 241ms, and their spreads are much lower on average. If I want to try and Trail my SL I can because they do not have a 5 pip limit as my other broker did. And my market orders are being filled within less than a pip, I do not know if this will continue like this, after all this is the Forex market! Hope it helps

I set a SP = 15, but after 15 minutes I leave the operation, yet have never been lost to SP. The percentage of success is quite high, so that after a losse trade multiply x2 lots, it seems safe, I doubt that we have to reach above factors x8 multiplication.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Dee50, Thanks for the share and analysis. My entry for the second last entry (18 pip DD one) was at 1.60348. My entry was sharp at 17.00. It did not hit TP. Me too use Armada. I closed it later for -10 pips. What was you entry point? Appreciate your help. Thanks bluejack

That's exactly what roulette players say at the casino ... and they all lose their money at the end. Remember that you will have always a worse bad streak than the previous worse bad streak ...

Thank you very much for this posting. I have some question: we have to wait until both indicator show same direction? If show then same direction of the higher frame. Or can you please tell me your system… Thanks again…

--- 帖子 #286 ---
If you read the first 3 pages , he has clearly mentioned about it.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Sorry but I did not trade GU today but looking at the chart, if I had been, I would have had to exit just like you. This is why we need to demo this method for a while, to work out how to get out when fate tickles your balls and misses your TP by one pip.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
This is what I find incredible. Post Number 5. page 1 Hi ComoxBluejay, Thanks for sharing. Do you wait until both indicators show the same direction, and have also the same direction of the higher frame, or how do you do it (if the current and higher timeframe give opposite signals)? Post Number 8. Page 1 Hi Dragos, Hi Mary4x I don't wait for anything to 'Match up'. Just trade in the direction of the last bar painted by the NonLagMA. And then.

I am glad it was not Sorry for your loss.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I had the exact same trade and ended up getting out as you did for a -10 pips the rest were winners

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Guys, how did you finished with todays 3pm UK time trade? At the beggining of the hour NonLagMa was red and then it reversed. Did you took loss of 16 pips or somehow managed to take 3 pips profit?(after spread it is only 2 pips).

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Nice trading. You managed to get out of 2 trades with a loss of only -2 pips and -3 pips, any clues as to how you did that? You mention leaving the operation after 15 mins, I take it that this means you close the trade after 15 mins, is that regardless of your position? I would agree that based on the current very limited information that a large SL (SP) is not needed, but, for myself, I prefer to have a secondary emergency SL when scalping, just in case. I have a primary SL which I call experience.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I think this is the same trade that "Bluejack" and "AllyB" ended up closing for -10 pips and probably every one else! Looking at the chart I think it is unlikely that any one closed for a profit.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
dee, did you trade through the news?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Y indeed. So the best way looks like is to go M5/M15 and check what new NonLagMa shows..

--- 帖子 #298 ---
be cautious in using this system, i have tried it for 1.5 days and yielded good results. however, i almost lost my gained profit from it with 1 bad trade. Indicator repaints as well, specially when price moves the other direction so i suggest use SL. (assuming you're trading big lots)

--- 帖子 #299 ---
There was an opportunity to close that G/U trade on BE or small profit before it moved into higher DD. I had a same trade opened at pepperstone demo with TS of 4 pips. It was opened 1 minute late and this trade closed for profit. Below is the Actual trade which i closed for loss.

Draw Down chart for today, remember this is EU not GU. The trade markers are where I was playing with a Trade Manager, needs work as I kept missing out on pips. But no losers today. Beginning to get the inklings of an idea how to filter the trades but too early to tell for sure, this is only day 3 of testing. Look at trade number 4, 3 bars back was a fully fledge Pin Bar and even though my head was saying "don't go long" I did, and had to suck up the draw down. I have tried trading like the OP with just the line chart, but I feel naked and exposed and at my time of life that is not a pleasant sight.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Dee.. Thank You again. !

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi folks, My tests for today (+18.7): 10:00 +8.3 11.00 +5.4 12:00 +6.3 13:00 +10.5 14:00 -15.2 15:00 +5.4 16:00 -9.7 18:00 +7.7 Except for the last one, it was sweating out the DD - might want to reduce that. I had a SL of 25, TS of 2.5 and TP of 10. The OP did not explain exactly how to exit : " TP is easy...if the movement is slow I'll grab 1/2/3/4 pips." (fair enough, I might be able to catch that after some 100 trades..) and " Sl is a visual thing......If the Nonlag is running the same color as the ma above in the main window, I'll take a chance on the trade returning to profit. Believe it or not it usually does. If I'm trading against the top ma, I'll close the trade at 3/4 pips" This second part is what confuses me: Nonlag the same color as the MA means either in profit or time to get out -or does it?. I tend to wait and see if it turns around if they are NOT the same color (MA being against). It wouldn't surprise me if I missed a couple of points here, so any reactions are welcome.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Go5.. Thanks for sharing. These are the results for which pair? And about your question, the OP says that when the trade is in DD, and both the MAs are same color, he will wait for the trade to return to profit. If the ma in the main window is of different color, he will close the trade for 3/4 pip loss. (This is what I understood). Thanks Bj

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Sorry, it was GU; CET. My confusion put another way: if you are in DD (say a buy) and entered on the top of the hour, the only possibility to wait it out is when the NonLag is still green (and the ma-1 red) - when the Nonlag also turns red THEN I would get out (some extra discretion might come in here of course). The ma-1 (main window) changes immediately its color to red if in DD so this logic from the OP doesn't make sense to me...??

--- 帖子 #317 ---
only on Demo thou ...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
the MA in the main window is set to 1 so it will change on any movement above or below the bar open. the OP uses a line chart which will map exactly the MA. i dont think the main window MA is giving any extra info at all the non lag of the current bar often changes colour, so if you use that as an exit you will cut out of most winning trades there is something in this system but today 2 trades -26 pips so far therefore with the strategy target i now need six wins in a row to break even in hindsight ...red news early in the day and Euro eco summit is disrupting all currencies .. so i should have stayed out as i'm guessing most here were smart enough to do

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Maybe you hold on to your losers to long ? or to short ? Best regards

Has anyone tried this on renko or range bars? 20 pip renko blocks

--- 帖子 #327 ---
where did you get the ea from?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Wouldn't it take at least some 200 trades / pair to be able to come to that conclusion? The NonLag by the way does not always change color so quickly since it is looking at 5 bars but when it does, you can be at 20+ pips in DD (happened today with GU at 11:00 CET...).

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I paid a coder

--- 帖子 #330 ---
looks like it worked well!not too sure how renko will work if your triggering off the nonlag

EU Draw Down Chart. Hope you are doing this for the GU especially as it is more volatile. Trade number 2 was a discretionary trade the signal was long, but I went short because price was not breaking thru the S&amp;R level. Then the Trend line formed and after that I would not have gone short any way. Not the rules but I hate to ignore the obvious! Trade number 5 perfect example as to why a Hard Stop is necessary!! some idiot politician opened his mouth and POP price dropped, this time only 15 pips, then went straight back up again, this only took 2 mins and I wasn't looking at the time.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
how much did you pay for that?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Dee, Thanks again for the analysis. From your results it seems 12 pips SL for EU should be fine, I believe. (I know it's early.. but still) What do you think..?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
dee thanks for your charts...can i ask. are you trading off the 5m chart?...if so what is your signal?... are you trading through news?...are these the pips you took on the trade or anlaysed after?...top trading from what ive seen from you in the last few days

You must copy the file in the right folder. To find the right folder, open your platform, then click File &gt; Open Data Folder &gt; MQL4 ... then in the MQL4 folder you will find the indicators folders. Once your tool is in the right folder, restart the platform. Your indicator is now listed under the custom indicators list in your platform. That's it!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I think it is far too early to tell. The Hard Stop is for emergency purposes only, to protect against the unexpected, stop hunt, politicians big mouth etc. So far the max draw down has been 15 &amp; 18 pips so a SL of 12 pips is a little on the light side, the OP said "Sl is a visual thing......If the Nonlag is running the same color as the ma above in the main window, I'll take a chance on the trade returning to profit. Believe it or not it usually does. If I'm trading against the top ma, I'll close the trade at 3/4 pips." I interpret this to mean that he takes a -3 to -4 pip loss, so the skill here is to identify as soon as possible when it is time to get out. I look to a lower time frame to determine this because at this point I can not see what the OP sees. I have just thought of something, I am going to start recording the Total pip range from the entry point for each 1 hr period to explore the reality of "This is a scalping system, but also works well for short trend following." There are a few traders already trading this way, Off Thread but it would be good to have a record of what is possible.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
No, I am trading off the 1hr chart but look down a TF, sometimes 2, to see if they confirm the entry, example of this was trade number 2. The signals are at the top of the hour so most trades have completed before the news, at least for the EU pair, GU is a different animal and the news comes out at different times. The charts are an analysis of DrawDown and the figures represent the drawdown for each trade, I present them on a 5 min chart because it is much easier to see the PA. From this we can see what the Max DrawDown was and how long the trade took to reach TP the idea is if we know how long a trade takes to normally complete we can determine at what point in time we should be looking to get out of a potential loser. 4 pips TP should not take long if we are trading in the right direction!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Agree and nice idea to get the pip range. I will try my best to get some test results. Thanks

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Guys it really works, that system(did 2 months review). But thing is not to take each hour trade blindly, but be avoid of s/r and pivots. Read what chart says and put a trade if the is no turnaround signs. That's it

--- 帖子 #344 ---
how many pips do you usually take? and what do you do if the nonlagMA repaints? do u stick to the initial color direction, or you pull out your bet?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
TP is 4 pip including spread(1.3) Suppose 90% win rate. Why not hedge loosing trades? Eg in the picture. If price never returned in a day trades can be closed at 9 pip DD. But what happens if it reverses the moment we unhedge? Do we hedge again. Hedging it self require lot of skills.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
3.5-4 pips on avg. No, i am not sticking to a trade if MArepaints, closing and opening another position

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Sorry to sound like a noob here. What do they mean by "top of the hour" ? I trade EUR/USD if that makes a difference and not G/U as the op does.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
He meant start of the hour. If you read through, you can see charts posted by Dee50 on E/U.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Just tried a "Trend Following" trade, you really need to use a Trade Manager, I used WUKAR WB Trail (attached), not entirely sure of the settings, I had it set to use HiddenTP and Hidden TS &amp; Hidden SL and I could not move my TP so I wonder if you do not use Hidden that you can adjust your TP on the fly. I set move to BE at 3.5pips and then trailed every 3.5 pips, thought that might be too close but this time it just ran up the candle straight to TP of 21pips. Beats the hell out of 4 pips!!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Today 5 Tp and 3 SL, trading at M30

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Have you tried to do BT is it better to use trailing profit or it is better to collect 4 pips each hour?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Oh okay so at a gap of every 1 hr on a TF of M5 or h1 or whatever? So we go in the direction of the current nonlag MA bar based on that? ?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
If you don't mind, How much were the SLs? Thank You Bj

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Closing after each candle if different NonLagMa. SL varies from 2 to 20 pips. Todays summary of different trading style and paying attention to s/r, pivots: 1. trading H1 candle only. Profit 0 pips. 2. trading M30 candle which opens when new hour starts: -35pips. 3. trading M30 canlde which opens in the middle of the hour: -2 pips 4. Trading M15 and looking for move patterns: +24 pips

--- 帖子 #355 ---
The strategy is based on the H1 chart and also uses the color MA. See post 1.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Something like this? The arrow points to the last bar right so go short? Also if we go only by the nonlag MA bar, whats the use of the MA_color? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Its actually the current bar displaced back 1 hour (although there appears to be no real reason to displace it) - so the current bar. e Some guys use the color MA as a confirmation of immediate direction on the new hour (i.e. in the first 5-10 seconds). So if the NonLag MA is green, but the color MA is immediately pushing red on the current bar (price going down), then you could hold off the entry until price moves back up to the open price and the color MA starts to flash a tiny bit of green. This way you can avoid immediately getting into a losing position - especially if the price drops. Alternatively if the color MA stays green, you could stay in the trade longer and get more than the 3-4 pips, as some guys here have done. Regardless you need to be quick on the entry/exit.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Just stuck with the time factor. Right now the time is 16:41 EST. Correct me if I'm wrong but I shouldn't open a position now since its not the beginning of the hour and instead should wait till its 1700 EST and then look for the bar color and evaluate based on the MA color for confirmation, correct? One last question, I'm guessing this indicator would be used only with pure PA and even if there's remotely any sort of fundamental noise, not just a high impact event but even a low event in the calendar in which case we should avoid opening a position then during that period, correct?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Remember, the trading time recommended is 9:00 - 16:00 UK time - so an hour after the London open (i.e. need some movement on the hourly candles for the strategy to work). Yes, at the beginning of the hour. Yes - look at bar color (nonlag MA) and confirm with MA color. Regarding news - stay away from high impact events for sure. Always helps to be opening a trade in the direction of the daily sentiment for the pair. That said this is really just a 3-4 pip scalp so if you look at most hourly candles they will have a wick that size (or more), even if price reverses on that candle. To your point its a price action play at the top of the hour.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks for clarifying. Okay I thought I read somewhere in the thread that we could trade this with EUR/USD as well in which case I should still only opt for the london session? Are those hours chosen because there is less of news events if so I could pick something after 10pm EST right because usually for eur/usd it tends to be quieter from 2200 EST to about 3AM EST(london open)?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Yes it is on the hour (e.g. 9 am UK time). I don't think the trading hours for the strategy was designed with news as the key factor. However the London and London/US overlap sessions is when most news happens and most volume occurs, and as a result that is when there is more volatility/price action to easily provide the 3-4 pip scalp. If you want to trade this in the 5pm EST to 3 pm EST timeframe you will struggle a lot more to easily and consistently get the 3-4 pip scalp on the hourly candle, given typical volatility/price action for that timeframe. Not saying it cant be done, especially if there is good price movement in the Asian session, but just a lot harder to do consistently - often an entire hourly candle is only 5-10 pips at that time. Try it on demo and see if you can make it work.

EU +5+5+5+10. 2 Hourly Trade signals ignored (filtered). 1 trade improvised. If you have traded EU for long enough you will know that todays PA is typical for FOMC day and you will trade accordingly, if you do not know the EU pair or the pair you have chosen to trade, you will probably be handed your arse on a platter. By the looks of the numbers viewing listed at the bottom of the window, every one has gone over to the "5 PIPS - Only Five" thread, which kills me because it is "exactly the same" as this thread using a 5 period moving average just represented in a visually different way.

EU. another 2 trades this time using a Trade manager. +5 Trailing Stop (TS) +10 TS. Again I ignored a 1hr signal as I was waiting for the Triangle Breakout. It occurred with the signal, I opted for a 30 pip TP but the TS was taken out, I re-entered, TP in same place but TS got taken again, so I need to re think my TS strategy. BUT. what this shows is that the signals are generally reliable and if you add some common sense to the decision making process this is a very good Method. All Praise to the OP, may his hair always remain plenty full.

11 trades today changed rules slightly to TP 5, SL 11, aiming to +%68 accuracy, from +80% with TP 4 , SL 16 also used heiken ashi candles, 8 winners, 3 loosers. The first on GBPUSD was a marginal looser for 0.3 pips. would have been a winner at TP 4. 100 percent success on 7 trades that the indi color aligned with the Heiken Ashi color. when not aligned, 3/4 were loosers. last trade on EURJPY was not taken because of red news. I opened 6 positions, lost 2 of them. below are the screenshots. succes percentage dropped to 80% (not for all trades, only those randomly taken by me) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Among pairs with ADR greater than 100, those four have the lowest spread (EURUSD not counted) GBPUSD is by far the more suitable in terms of spread and ADR. the 0.14 trade size is for my convenience. It is about 1 euro/pip.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi many thanks for the charts and information, much appreciated. Perhaps I'm missing the obvious here but I thought you took the trade based on the colour of the previous NonLag bar? For example in your image of the GBPUSD 1H the third tick previous bar is green but the price went down? Or have you changed the Indi somewhat? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I changed displacement from -1 to 0 so as the indi to run in the same row with candle.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thanks for the reply, that makes sense. Looking forward to more posts from you in the future. Do you have any specific entry requirements other than the 2 colours aligning and the high ADR? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi, thank you for sharing the system, ComoxBluejay! I tried it for the first time. UJ : +5, +5, +5, +5 so far. TP = 5, SL = 10, filtering : I took trade only when NonLagMA of H1 and that of M15 were the same color. when the color was different, skipped.(cross marks on the chart) I don't know UJ suits to this system. I picked up UJ just because it's low spread and I started trading during Tokyo session. Anyway, I will continue testing the method. It's very interesting.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Doing the same just taking M30 candle for confirmation not M15

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Does the NonLagMA repaint after candle close? Greetings.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
no

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Sorry, I missed your post. I am not ignoring H1, if you look at the chart the vertical lines represent the hourly signals, red for short green for Long, I did not take trade number 2 (short) because price had closed back above a major S&amp;R level, out of the picture is a HTF rising trend line, so I stayed out. trades number 5 &amp; 6 I stayed out because a Triangle had formed and the price range at this point was only 7 - 8 pips, too risky also I was waiting for the Break out. All the information is on the chart. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thanks for the reply. Awesome and simple strategy, i started today to test it and so far so good: +4+4+4+4+4. Im using SL=16 but im gonna reduce it (10 or 12). Is there a way to automatically trail the stop once it reach 4pips? I tried to set on mt4 trailing stop=40points but it wont work! Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
wheelbarrel EA, it allows trailing stop

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Ty doing the same here- if not far from pivot or s/r level -not taking the trade.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Appreciated it man but since i already use an EA for auto SL and TP it doesn't allow me to use one more EA!

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Indeed yours choice which one to use. But if no magic number is put for specif pair i think if you put wheelbarrel EA on new pair it will to trailing stops for all opened positions as it is done in the way to manage all opened positions

Great!! Gonna try it right now, thanks again

According to the rules we enter the same way as the previous nonlag bar which would have given us a buy where price has gone down? Do we just accept this as a loss or is there a filter that we should use?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
No system/method is 100% right ... so just accept the loss and look for the next signal.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Does anyone can explain exactly when the position is opened or before or after closing 1H candle? ComoxBluejay: "I scalp using a one hour time frame &amp; trade at the top of each hour ." ComoxBluejay: Quoting Indrek I think that this system cannot be backtested unless using a trade simulator. Because the entry is upon a NonlagMA bar that is just opening. At hindsight we do not know what color it was at the open, we only see what color it was at the close. So, let us see what forward test will show. You have completely missed the point.....you trade in the direction indicated by the last bar painted.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Non LAG MA not appearing for the current bar denoted by the blue dotted vertical bar .. Is it any problem from my side.? And also it seems the Non-LAG MA HIST repaints .. last closed bar changed to red from green after candle close when the current bar was falling down for few pips. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #397 ---
yes the last bar may repaint, but its not supposed to be closed yet since its repainting.. the -1 displacement on your nonlagma setting will cause your current candle stick &amp; indicator not to align.

ATTENTION GUYS! Today half of the day tried to make an EA for this system. And what can i say? System is not working, at least backtesting. Starting 2014 till today we have approx 1600 trades if we trade each hour.If we put trade by the colour of the non_lag_Ma (if previous bar is higher than the 2 bars before than it is green) we get 96% of winining trades using SL of more than 100 pips. So overall our profit curve will be negative. If we do sync with M15 or M30 or with both we get postive trades also at around 96% level, but profit curve will be negative. So i tried to improve that. If there are a doji in M30 or M15 and if M5 or M15 gives an oposite candle with the candle body more than 7-18pips(i was changing it) i also got negative profit. Than profitable trades are only around 80% We actually lower our profitable trades as sometimes we get spikes in price action in opposite direction than our trade during an hour. Without adjusted stop loss i have 1485 winning and 60 trades losing, with adjsuted stop loss as wrote above i have 1180 trades positive and 360 negative. That negative trades increase due to these price actions as we see different price movement during hour. And it is not only during the hours when news are released, it is random. Also tried to exit the trade if next H1 or M30 candle has different Non_lag_ma colour. Results are the same - we are losing with profit factor of 80%. Another thing is that tried to put MA20 and MA50, to trade with trend. Results were better, there are less noise. But again very low TP vs SL gives as negative results... Any other guys advice when you got better results? I can test it and see how it goes.. Would be nice if someone will reply whose trades were working during July 28th, Sep 11th, March 12-13th and they have not caught any big loss during these days. If they caught, well then that system won't work in long term Cheers, Orangutangas

--- 帖子 #399 ---
So the displacement will set the no lag hist bar to move 1 step back from the current candlestick....

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I think you are flogging a dead horse. IMO trying to make an EA for a discretionary method is nigh on impossible, yes it will work some times under the right conditions (my viagra is the same) but often it requires sheer will power to make it work (just like my viagra). I found this EA on the nonlagma indicator originator's thread on ForexTSD if he could not get it to work who can? http://www.forex-tsd.com/metatrader-...-tools-24.html Good Luck with it

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Thank you... it sucks a bit that it can't work automatic.. Are you still gonna trade lazy system, using non-lag_ma and not entering at hot spots where s/r lines are crossing?

Hi as002, Thanks for posting your results, your nonlag bar appears to be one behind mine (see below) and during my testing this seemed to give me 5/5 wins. Have I got it wrong using the -1 Displace setting ? Attached Image Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #408 ---
"9/14 overall today" But with a 4 pip TP and a 16 pip SL that equals: 32 pips gained in the 8 winning trades 80 pips lost in the losing trades Overall -48 pips for the day... To me the RR is far too unrealistic to be long term profitable, sure maybe a few months in a row get lucky, but all you need is that alignment to happen. Am I missing something here?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I changed the -1 to zero so as to align the indi with the candle.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
TP is 5 and SL 10 on screenshots I've posted. I checked out the GBPUSD for Sep'14 and Oct'14. I took ALL TRADES, one hour prior to frankfurt open to the end of it. Attached Image All trades (in total 184, 90+94) were opened on hour change, except about 8-10, where the 1min RSI was +70/-30 , and I waited for a retracement. The second half of September was a disaster. About -80 pips. What I seems is that if you go 100% percent mechanical, it is very much possible that will end up, with the same account size, maybe a little plus or minus. But you will make your broker very happy. Lots of dicretion is needed in many trades.....

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Try SL 25. BE+1 @3.5. TP 7, 10 etc? There will be times when the full SL is hit, usually following a Double Bottom or Double Top. SL to BE +1 after 3.5pips will be taken out more often but also losses should be less, increase TP to a percentage of ATR 3 or a fixed TP. eg. ATR = 17, TP 50% = 8.5pips. One of the off thread traders uses SL 25. BE +1 at 3.5pips TP 20, attached some results Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have been playing with a TS, but I have not got the settings right yet, so far I have not been able to stay in for a runner.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Tried a lot different variations, including and TS. But not gettin anything positive in long term...

YES REPAINT....... !!!!!!!. why you say no repaint?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
having noticed a repaint

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #416 ---
It does repaint but that's not a deal breaker for me. Do you want a signal thats accurate now or was an hour ago but now isn't? Price changes so do indicators.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I only watched GBPUSD today. Four signals 3/4 wins. The third trade was a loss but could easily be avoided, knowing forex basics. Regarding the repaint issue, the index color does not change after the candle close (if this is what you mean by repaint). All four trades were taken live, and the color is the same until now. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Yup that is the trick! The author said he just trade GBPUSD (and he traded this strategy for 2 years), this means he knows how this market moves and he knows which trade to take and which one to avoid in order to be profitable long term. This means a bit of knowledge on price action would help a lot eitherwise would be a coin-flip as you guys said. The "Displace -1" could trick you make it seems to repaint but it does not after the close of the candle (i just tested on 1hr tf). I did never figure out why the author use this settings, maybe it is just more comfortable for him. Greetings.

This thread seems to be dying down a little... anyone still trying to make this profitable long term?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Yes, since this only costs a couple of minutes/hour...it is working and I simplified it even more: only using the "non lag ma nrp", no histo or ma (the ma did not have any useful function anyway..). After 2 months or so we'll have some stats to look at.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
yup, still testing/doing it. just avoid using it during big news.

some comments regarding the previous post. -Half of the trades were taken live,on a 100 euro account used gor trial purposes. -For the rest I tried to make it as real as possible, using the F12 feature on MT4. - I use HA candles -the pair is GBPUSD -SL 10, TP 5 -trading time is between CET 0700-1700, that is one hour prior to FO to frankfurt close. -the left table is what the header states....... 100% mechanical, ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTION AT ALL. -on the right side the trades are sorted out based on the RSI. If at xx:00, the indi changes color, and the RSI on 1min TF is between 32-68, I trade as per the initial plan. If at xx:00 the indi goes red (green), and the RSI on 1min is -32 (+68), that is oversold (overbought), probaly you can see a series of red (blue) candles, then I wait for the next sell (buy) signal, based on the TDI today's trades. 1/4 wins until now, -25 pips. On the right side, 1min TF, the red line is the mechanical trade, the yellow is the TDI trade. Both were on the red. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Another successful day, easily hitting target. Thanks to ComoxBluejay and later to as02 for the original inspirational thread. The stop loss was hit on one trade due to trying a S/L EA to manage the trades.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Could not resist just one more trade today. Over 180 pips since started last week.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
wow-- nice results Kaylan. How are you trading this? Looks like your using the -1 in the no lag... Are you using the rsi like as002 or just going off the color match of NL and color ma?... Im thinking this looks like a good candidate for a EA.. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi mtbb Thanks for your interest. Mainly using the NL (set to 0) and the colour ma. as the first indication Find the line chart ideal for clear indication on which way to trade. Also I confirm with a candle chart before committing a trade. 1 hour and 15 mins There is an EA in the thread somewhere but I did not have much success with it. Its really a matter of using your eyes and common sense. Watching for pivot points, round numbers and news. and mostly going with the trend Tried various s/l trade managers but seem to cause me more problems that what they are worth. It really is a simple system.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Nice going Kaylan, Do you find it works better with the NL set to 0 as opposed to the original rules of -1?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
It seems to work for me. It is just one small part of a collection of aids to try to find the right direction to open a trade. Not been around to do a full day today.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Roger that, I'll give it a whirl next week using the original settings to start with and see how it goes. Nice looking Dog BTW, mine is a Boerboel, South African breed.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Wish you luck, although you should not need it. I was amazed how easy it is, hopefully you will find the same. I have added to this post the indicators I use The original NL and MA in Color Also two that I added myself, one to plot the trend and the other to set pivot points, Hope they help you. As mentioned previously, I use two charts. A line chart and also a candle chat for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
[quote=Kaylan;12251373] Also two that I added myself, one to plot the trend and the other to set pivot points, Should have mentioned. The CTI tool indicator does produce buy/sell signals alerts and arrows , but I tend to ignore these. Never bothered to work out how to switch them off. They are not part of my trading method. Just use it for the trend channel lines. The Pivot Points All in One I use on classical setting but do thicken the lines to setting 2 so I can see them better.

Well done Dave. Really pleased to see you have grasped the methodology well You have made a few green pips today. Are you using a fixed S/L each time with a T/S? It concerns me that I sometimes leave a lot of pip on the table by only taking 3 - 5 pip profit. I have been looking and testing various S/L EA's Anyone have any favourite that work well. These are what I have tried so far

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thanks Kaylan, No I don't use a TS, just a fixed SL then move it manually as the profit moves up, I'm not too concerned about leaving Pips on the table, they will still be there tomorrow LOL just take what the market gives you. I think I have a SL EA somewhere, I'll try and find it and post over the weekend, you might be able to make it work for you.

quote = yag interesting thread. i tried a few trades on demo and realized that the new, actual Bar of the Nonlag indicator is repainting. how do you solve this problem? Yes it does but according to the originator of the thread. [quote=ComoxBluejay;7809653]Hi Dragos, Hi Mary4x I don't wait for anything to 'Match up'. Just trade in the direction of the last bar painted by the NonLagMA. Its a case of using the last closed bar and common sense assisted by the other information to hand. Its not a prefect science but is overall profitable for me so far.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Yes would go with that.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
There was confusion 4 years ago about which bar was the closed /closing bar my setting is zero not -1 on the NL Each to there own on that.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
thank you for your comment Kaylan and since! but here is the point i am still not sure. should we use the current open bar (COB) as a signal trigger (which repaints)? or the previous closed bar (PCB)?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
The rules are not cast in stone! use whatever you feel works best for you. I use -1, Kaylan uses 0. It's horse's for courses

--- 帖子 #465 ---
that is not my question. if its -1 or 0...it really doesnt matter. i know that;-) my question is: should we use the current open bar (COB) as a signal trigger, which repaints? or the previous closed bar (PCB), which doesnt repaint?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I can appreciate your frustration wanting a black and or white answer so you know how to trade. The thread originator ComoxBluejay tried to answer your question as below. [quote=ComoxBluejay;7809653] I don't wait for anything to 'Match up'. Just trade in the direction of the last bar painted by the NonLagMA. In my opinion I take that to mean the current bar (which may repaint) I do tend to agree with this, as the previous closed bar is historical and therefore lagging. It is supposed to be a Non lagging indicator therefore you can only use the latest bar as your indicator It is not a precise mechanical system therefore common sense must be used along with the indicators you use. As Boo15 says It's horse's for courses whatever works for you. hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
It works for me. Hit my target for today.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
You will notice I had a small loss. this was due to trying a defective EA on the system (Not yours Boo15) It opened and closed two trades with in one second each (see chart below) I have blanked out some trades using different pairs as they are not results for the Lazy trading method.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
As a matter of interest yag, did you take the trade on the line chart as a buy? and did it hit your TP and get green pips?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Forgot my 10am trade was still running when I posted todays results. Now closed to boost my profit for today a bit more. All finished for the day now.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
... Ignored thank you for your detailed answer. i actually understand a lot better now and i realize that "non lagging" means fresh, but there is a discretionary part in it. and that's where the advantage of this system lies. i will, as i have done so far, use all my knowledge i have gained over the past years. in any case, this "non lagging" indicator is a great help.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
i got out with a discretionary decision and took a -1 pip loss.

Hello guys, just wanted to share my method of lazy trading. I do Expert Advisors that I generate with EA Studio and I test over 60 in one Demo account. I follow the results with FXblue and place on live only the top 10 that currently make profit. So far the results are great and I just check the EAs twice a day. Getting lazy yeah, but it took me some time to create the portfolio. Of course from time to time I generate new EAs.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Interested to see what you have achieved andonfree I checked out the Indy which I thought might help Lazy Trading. Unfortuately not really suitable. What I did find though is an amazing indicator system which generates signals for profitable trades called HGI on SHF

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hello Kaylan, it is quite interesting. So far I am quite satisfied with the results. However, I do not want to hurry to be happy. You can test the program, it has 15 days free trial and for this time you can export as many EAs as you wish. Works great.

looking at this very interesting system. following. Unfortunately my timeslot will make it difficult to follow. But It is similar to a method I used a while back but abandoned. I like the simplicity of it. I have added a few indicators to help with the OPs trading as well as the SAR signal. but I think we are starting to get into paralysis by analysis after a point. Since I will be available during the Asian session I will be looking at Asian pairs to find the best mover. in the meantime I have uploaded what I am using . I am going to get rid of the SAR signal though. Im not sure how it is helpful as a filter.

Hi! Anybody still using this lazy system? ) What tp/sl are you using?

Not been on here for a long while, stopped trading as had a family matter that needed my full attention. Still an ongoing situation but it is my intention to get back to this profitable method when I can. It is still the only truely successful method I have come across.

Any chance to get this system working on MT4 iOS version?

I tried this system today but with no success probably due that the NonLagMA_v7_HIST indicator repaints.

Hi What rules are you applying? The method says it's simple - but I'm too daft. Looking for someone that has the patience to help me understnd what's goingon.

Hi, thanks for sharing. What does top of the hour mean? Last minute of the candle of the hour? Is it as simple as just entering a trade in the direction of the previous non lag indicator when the new candle opens?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Yeah, I agree with you... have you had any luck?

I was trying this non-lag indicator. When it changed from green to red, at the close of the candle i entered short, then in the next candle when trade went against me the red line in the indicator repainted to green...so it seems like this indicator repaints.
