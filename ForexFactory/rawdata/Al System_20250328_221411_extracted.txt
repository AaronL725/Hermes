Good Luck and looking forward to it.

Things to note about the zigzag indicator::: 1: It repaints because -by definition - it has to. Therefore, the length of a leg can increase with time! 2: It is possible to know where a leg of the ZZ must be drawn - relative to another indicator. So, those who say it is impossible to determine where/when a new leg will be drawn are a little behind time! 3: ZZ is directly connected to the stoch indicator and there is a way to know how far price will retrace, using both indicators. 4: The ZZ is time-dependent. It is possible to know When a leg will stop growing with precision!!! These are the four things you need to know Structure This system is based on the relationship between the Zig zag and the Stochastic. "Consider stoch with the following settings; %k =X, slowing = 1, %d = 1, Close/Close, where X is any positive integer. Consider the last X bars - including the current one. Let the High/Low value of price be A/B resp.. This stoch =0 &lt;=&gt; the current price = lowest over the period. This stoch =100 &lt;=&gt; the current price = highest over the period. This stoch =50 &lt;=&gt; the current price = mid-way between the highest and the lowest price over the period. Other values of stoch can be calculated in this way. THE STOCH = 0/100 =&gt; A LEG OF THE ZZ MUST APPEAR . A LEG OF THE ZZ APPEARS =&gt; stoch is at 0/100 almost surely. probability here = 90%+ Therefore, the ZZ repaints because the stoch repaints. (That is the stoch above can stay at 0/100 for a while or leave 0/100 and return there without first going to 100/0. So, the last time stoch is at 0/100 before going to 100/0 is the end of the current ZZ leg!!!

The picture will try to explain the statements. Numbers three (3) and (6) is what we want to exploit. We have very high winning probabilities taking these setups

--- 帖子 #6 ---
These were setups I traded.

Thanks Albert for the system, Questions from a noob coming your way and if you could answer them it would be great. 1. "Consider stoch with the following settings; %k =X, slowing = 1, %d = 1, Close/Close, where X is any positive integer." How is the value of X related to Zig-Zag? 2. When you say 0/100 do you mean stoch is at 0 and when you say 100/0 do you mean stoch is at 100? 3. " Therefore, the ZZ repaints because the stoch repaints. (That is the stoch above can stay at 0/100 for a while or leave 0/100 and return there without first going to 100/0.)" The stoch can stay at oversold and overbought levels for quite a while. Could you please elaborate on the underlined portion if possible with an example. Once again thank you for the system kind sir.

I hope we can move on to business. Zigzag setting: 25,1,1 and Stock:18,1,1 close/close. Default settings for parabolic. Entries. 1. It is true that almost anytime the stockastic closes on 100 or 0 a new zigzag leg appears or repaints. 2. We use this to our advantage whenever the stockastic is at 100 or 0 and there is no zigzag leg. 3. We always take the trade in the direction of the Parabolic.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Aaven, 1.X is any integer say 30 for the stock......... Zig zag should be 30, then they are similar and directly related. 2. Yes 3.Okay, lets say the stock is at 100 now, so long as it remains there without closing at 0, you may keep having the zigzag leg making newer Highs.... but when the stock closes at 0 we expect a new ZZ leg to appear low and probably continue going low if the stock keeps closing at 0 without going to 100. I hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Missed these

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hello Albert, I appreciate you for taking the time to answer my queries. One doubt though, Zigzag setting: 25,1,1 and Stock:18,1,1 close/close. Default settings for parabolic. To have direct relation the Zig-Zag and Stoch needs to have the same value, isn't it? Here Zig-Zag is 25 and Stoch is 18. Kindly help me to understand. Once again thanks a bunch for starting the thread and taking the time and effort to help the people. Have a glorious day.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
You are absolutely right Aaven. The ZZ and Stock having the same value will give a direct relation with a win rate of about ++90% as stated in previous posts. However my settings give more entries but exposes you to more fake setups. My settings only reduce the probability slightly but its good enough. Regards Al

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks Albert for the quick reply. Will study in detail and seek your guidance for further doubts. Thanks once again for your generosity.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You welcome Aaven. Those settings are my little tweak. Al

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hello, really interesting strategy. Thank you very much! One question: Is it only a setup when stochastic reached 100 or would it be enough when it reaches for example 97 or 98. I made some backtests and I saw that stochastik often reaches "nearly" 100 but not exactly. Would you ignore this trades or not? Thank you

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Sell on the red arrow, am i correct? but in this case a big news cause a spike that would have hit stop loss, but if no stop loss would have been a profit trade.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
The best setup is for stock at 100 or 0.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Your entry is right and you may have lost about 35 pips. However the setup was still valid for the second entry for +100 pips.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I believe you mean 3 and 6 here and not 7. Nice Thread.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Ooops!!!!! you are right. Thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
please how do we set TP for the set up,are we to close at the open of the next zigzag leg? thank you for the strategy,looks very promising.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
can we trade it on any timeframe or what is thew best timeframe for the strategy? can we use it on all pairs too?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
A big thanks Albert for your generosity.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hmmm.....I don't have a strategy for TP but depending on the quality of the setup you can go all out till you get an opposite ZZ leg. Little advice, if you are serious with forex and you really want to make a living from it, you should have a plan. For me 20 pips a day is enough.....any more is bonus, but I enjoy the bonus part more . Also make sure you know where your SL should be, then you can gauge your risk properly. In my settings the ZZ is 25, that means my SL will trail the High of the last 25 candles for a sell setup. You can trade any TF and Pair. I prefer the 1H TF

--- 帖子 #25 ---
​​If stoch is at 100 and there is no zz you sell, right? But if price keeps going higher and stoch keeps going back at 100 there can still be a zz leg?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
You are right. But the probabilities should be on your side. If stoch is at 100 and there is no ZZ you sell with a parabolic sell.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
May I ask how you came to the 90%+?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I quoted it from the thread provided in the 1st post and after testing I am convinced about the direct relation between ZZ and Stoch. But I am sure you can do the testing for yourself too.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Just looking at brexit.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Setting up nicely for a buy

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Very interesting system Albert thank you very much for sharing with us. I have never used ZZ indicator before and I'm going to demo this system for sometime If you don't mind may I ask, how long have you being trading this system successfully? And can this method be back-tested? (I'm asking this because I don't know much about ZZ indicator and I'm worried back testing would not work since it repaints )

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hmmm.......took this trade but stoch was not at 0. This is against the rule and must be managed closely. The best remains at 100/0 Closed for +30pips.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Well not too long but have done extensive studies on it. Yes you can back test it. And the repainting is good because that is what we are counting on.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Great! Thanks for the clarification

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Well done, this is an interesting take on a really good strategy. It's one of my favourites and one that I use quite a lot but as a way of identifying 'problem areas' that will be returned to at some point. I had not considered using it to trade in the opposite direction - but will definitely look into it! For anyone who wants to do some manual backtesting to see where the ZZ would have painted a top/bottom, I have attached an indicator I found for this purpose some years ago. You wouldn't want to leave it on permanently as it looks a mess but it's very useful for eyeballing previous setups.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I really like this system. It's simple and looks promising! Albert, can you kindly confirm whether I have understood your approach properly? 1. When the ZZ line is pointing upwards we look for Stoch 0 points and when ZZ line is pointing downwards we look for Stoch 100 points. 2. After finding a point, we wait for the parabolic to appear and take the trade in the direction of the ZZ line. 3. Stoploss should be placed above/below the high/low of the last 25 candles. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Looks like a buy trade will be possible within the next few hours (if I have understood the system properly)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks Hepsibah.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Did anyone take this trade.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
You may be right. But you the line, thats the low in the last 25 pips. if price gets there we will have a ZZ leg and your buy will be gone.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You are right. but remember to trail your SL as time goes/ as new candles are formed.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Unfortunately not. This one would have been rather nice as well!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yeah. Nice setup in the 30min, nothing, not even a clue in 1hr.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Question please. Haven't used PSAR in quite a while. Can change in direction flip (repaint) with extreme bar action? And, do you enter on first new PSAR directional dot, or wait for break of high/low, or some other trigger? Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks for the replies Noted

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh and @ll, u have a very nice strategy, i will look at i further now. As a little contribution i want to share a nice ZZ-indi that i have found on mql5[dot]com for free. The only thing i have made myself for testing is the midline. Here it is, hope it is helpfull for someone... greetings robcole

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I thank you Albert, this is going to be a great addition to my current strategy. Here is an example of how I am using it to help indicate a good time to retrace back to the missing leg. The 1hr chart shows the missing leg but, as the stoch had already reached zero, this would not be an ideal point to enter short despite the PSAR giving a down signal. So, at this point i am looking for a good entry point to retrace back to the missing leg price and have found a missing leg and a PSAR long signal on the 5m. Whether or not it will go all the way to TP without taking out the SL first we shall see

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks Robcole

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Interesting Hepsibah.......but I have some reservations that I wish to discuss. Let me put my thoughts together on this approach.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Apologies Albert for maybe derailing your thread a little. I was there at the beginning of the original thread which concentrated solely on the fact that a missing ZZ leg meant one would be painted at the price or better in the future and I have used the method on and off ever since and love it. But I can see that your opposite approach has much merit and could actually increase the effectiveness of the original. But I am more than happy to delete the posts if you think it is going to confuse people as this is a really promising thread and I would very much not want to slow the momentum.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
No no no. Its okay. I welcome diversity and much interested in your approach. Lets see how your style too goes am sure I will learn something. Can you explain again please. And can you update us on the trade. I see it may go down.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Albert, If you could, kindly share your insight about the following: 1. When trading this system do you consider any fundamentals of the pair that you are trading or is it purely a technical system by implementing it's rules? 2. How is news with this system? Do you still trade as is during news events or do you stay on the sidelines till the event has passed? Thanks once again for your generosity mate and most importantly helping everyone with their doubts with a cheerful smile... God Bless you...

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I just finished reading the thread you referenced in post 1. Thanks for that. I've never had so much fun reading any thread, as much as that one. Before EU can get going, everyone there is telling him why it doesn't work. Then, I've never seen that many revoked memberships on any other thread. Several people have aliases. I'm wondering if, after being there, if I'm on the NSA's watch list... All of that being said, in good fun, I believe your interpretation, and adding the PSAR, makes this a workable methodology. In fact I gave it a shot on M1, and saw it work properly. More next week. Cheers

--- 帖子 #54 ---
here' another zigzag (white lines)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks V

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Its suppose to be purely technical and I don't look at the news calendar. The news event scare me from taking the trade, this happened to me too often. Lol..you can just imagine that you have a nice setup but you hesitate to take it because of the news event, then shortly after price starts moving in your direction, what do I do, jump in or stay out. Now if you jump in you will not be going by the rules and you may be caught up in a situation. Are trading the news or a system. The good news however is that the original referred thread was showing something that many people failed to see 1. Turning points: Price will not go beyond those levels whether News event occur or not. 2. Trend continuations. We need to be confident in our trades, not all will be winners but we should have an edge in this business. I hope that helps. Al

--- 帖子 #58 ---
To try to explain, Eurusdd was all about finding price levels that would be revisited. In the 'how to use technical indicators properly' thread, he used mismatches between the stochastic and the zigzag and in the 'similarity' thread he used various others including a cycle identifier and stochastic with bollinger bands and latterly a concept called transient zones. It was quite an exciting period and, as someone has already remarked, he regularly banned all but a few cronies from posting but that aside, the concepts were quite sound in the main and had an astonishing accuracy. In the chart below I've tried to identify all the mismatches where the stoch makes a zero or 100 and the ZZ did not print a new leg (because it was not a HH/LL). These happen all day every day on all tf's and in principle, if you bought all the up arrows and sold all the down arrows, you would make money. The challenges are: a) whether or not price moves sufficiently in order to cover the spread and make a profit b) whether for those that do not immediately go in the right direction (like the one marked in lime), you can manage the MM properly until it returns.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
What I am loving about Albert's approach is that it concentrates on the ones that don't immediately come good and allows you to make money on them in the meantime. I am still fairly committed the the return levels concept but I think that putting the two approaches together could be extremely powerful. For instance here is the trade marked in lime above and how a combined approach could work very well.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Here's an indicator that shows mismatches between the Stochastic and Zigzag. I'm a bit of a purist and like the lookback periods on both to be the same but you can play around with it on different values, different pairs and different tf's. You may be amazed by how many opportunities there are.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks Hepsibah Also is there an indicator which marks the high/low of the previous 25 candles? Or is it possible for us to modify an indicator which marks daily highs/lows for this purpose? Just wondering And Albert can you please briefly explain the importance of Parabolic indicator for this system?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
It's probably easiest to use a donchian channel if you want to see where the HH/LL are. Just set the lookback period to whatever you want.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Your indicator is not correct, please change because....settings of zig zag an stochastic must be the same...like 18, 1, 1 and 18, 1, 1 ...you have zig zag with different settings

--- 帖子 #64 ---
You can use the settings you like For Albert's method we are using 18, 1, 1 for Stoch and 25, 1, 1 for ZZ because it gives more entries

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks I'll try this

--- 帖子 #66 ---
NO!!!!!! This system will work well only if settings will be the same!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I can do that when I get home this evening but you will find that the step value in the ZZ will not affect the signals and so they are usel able in the mean time

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I think not having the PSAR makes it better, directly entering on the stochs 0/100 closed h1 candle gives better entry and lower stop loss required. And i think having 18,1,1 on both zigzag and stochs is better too, the false setups causes the win rate to drop below 90%.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi all, Keeping a chart tidy whilst retaining the key information in a simple visual format is always my first objective to avoid distracting and potentially conflicting and confusing signals whenever I personally build a new template. Als template does get the information needed to trade I've no doubt, and I've copied his posted template and modified it to a slimmed down version, that is intended to a) Identify the likely current bias by use of a standard semaphore ( red or green circle in my case, but standard code signal does the same job) and take only those signals in that direction from the main semaphore signal and not the smaller signals that semaphore generates (colour those away). As someone here said, the zig zag is the same as the semaphore but for me the semaphore is tidier and features in most of my chart set-ups. b) Identify pull backs via the dots (I used the stochzigzag indicator posted earlier). To get pull back identification..... just change the code to opposite colours, I changed mine to dots whilst doing so but arrows would be no problem. My settings are 7,7 That's about it, the stochastic isn't really needed, neither is the parabolic sar and just adds more clutter and potential confusion and indecision. Here's a simple chart based upon Al's original, but changed as I've described. I've left the stoch window ( 7,1,1) for now in a reduced state simply because it's duplicating what I have on my main chart window. Here's an M30 UC chart for example illustrating the end product which currently tells me there is no sell signal yet, I need a red dot of course which will be a pull back signal and allowing me to get in short at a value area....make your own minds up what chart is more pleasing to the eye, and take 5 minutes to knock yourself up a template to your own preferred colours, I won't be doing that for you. MM is another subject and an individual topic. LL Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I did a look at the historical h1 charts for USD/CAD, here are the results for entries on 6/94 stochs instead of PSAR AND 18,1,1 for both zigzag and stochs, all stops are placed at 20 pips loss： PROFITS ARE ESTIMATED ASSUMING YOU TELL PROFITS IMMEDIATELY WHEN STOCHS REACH THE OTHER END （6 TO 94，94 TO 6） 1)MAY-DEC2014 - WIN 592 PIPS （13TRADES）/ LOSE 40 PIPS （2TRADES） 2)JAN-DEC2015 - WIN 776 PIPS (13 TRADES) / LOSE 0 PIPS 3)JAN-CURRENT2016 - WIN 842 PIPS (16 TRADES) / LOSE 40 PIPS (2 TRADES) This is just on one currency, i finetune the optimal stoploss to be maximum 20 pips, most trades win above 30 pips . Imagine if you combine results with other currencies, very promising indeed. I believe less volatile pairs like eur/usd can use 10 pips stop loss so that we can have low risk/high reward.

I am loving you all, wonderful inputs being shared. Thank you all. Watching the Derby match now ManU:ManC. And later my Realmadrid takes the pitch.........Then I have some time to brainstorm these wonderful inputs.....

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks Landline for your shared !may please ask you to post your indies and tpl?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I like where you are going with this LL. I'm not quite there in my understanding of what signal you prefer. Thanks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks for backtesting Steve. Same request for a few chart pics please. If your simply using Stoch 6,94 hits, I understand, and like the idea, particularly using the fixed SL. Many will argue the merits of this, however imo, fixing your SL gives more uniformity &amp; control, and allows easier administration of one's discipline.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Interesting method. What are the timeframes this will work? Many thanks for sharing this. Greets Michael

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The signal to trade is a pull back dot as described....why over-complicate, it seems clear and ultra simple to my mind

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I've detailed what to do earlier

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Its actually a visual backtest, i fix the take stop loss and and take profit method so that we can have a good gauge of the system profitability. Apparently, it is very good. I have attached 2 images for example, the reason why i chose 6,94 instead of 0,100 is on the 2nd image. If we are strict about 0,100 on stochs, we would not be able to enter this trade. Even if we were to take 50% of the profits from each year of my visual test, its still profitable

--- 帖子 #80 ---
If someone can code a simple ea that either sell or buy at stochastics level close that with simple stop loss and take profit base on stochastics close level that would be good. Just set the ea when u see the initial setup and remove it if the leg of the ZZ forms, works for h1 .

--- 帖子 #81 ---
the last version I posted only checked for instances where stoch=zero and there was no LL or where stoch=100 and there was no HH. This one uses the full Zigzag code and I have included all the inputs for both the stochastic and the zigzag so you can fully customise it. It gives more signals than the previous version.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi, interessting tests. One question: Did you took the trade after candle close? Or immediately when stoch reaches 94 even befor candle close?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Stevo, on both your photos, you show one each, Arrow &amp; √ mark. Do these have any significance? Thanks

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Hepsibah, thanks for your explanations but I am still trying to get my head round your system. Per the ZZ- stoch relation approach, almost 99% of the time they should be similar and I see a lot of similarity in the picture that you posted. 1% of the time we see mismatches/ dissimilarities/ Errors/ Rare events that hint us where to trade with that 90% probability. For example your blue arrow show stoch at 100 but no new ZZ leg: this is not accurate. For every candle stick that closed at 100 we expect a new ZZ leg and that should continue till Stoch closes on 0, then we expect ZZ leg in the opposit direction. And this is true almost 90+++% of the time. We want to take advantage of the rare events. Am not sure if I am making sense, but there is a lot of similarity that you are highlighting as mismatches. The indicator you shared give arrows that point out the mismatches but most of them point to similarities except if I am not getting your style. I may be wrong, please explain your entry again. Al

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Any time frame Mic.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi, Thanks for the strategy. Can I ask you, does the stoch repaint after close of the current candle? Also do we enter at the close of the bar or immediately when we see the sar dot and 0/100 on stoch? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
At each blue arrow, the stoch has printed a reading of 100 but the ZZ has not (yet) printed an extension of the up leg (or a new up leg if the previous leg was down) i.e. a point of dissimilarity exists. Eurusdd's claim was that the ZZ would, at some point in time, print a high at or beyond the point of dissimilarity. Vice versa for the red arrows. Not my system (I wish), just one example of Eurusdd's dissimilarity concept that can be replicated with any two indicators that are trying to measure the same thing but that, on occasion, are not in agreement.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Can you provide mql4 version of indicator? I might be able to use some of code in indicator for mine since no-one wanted to help me to code indicator so i decided to do it myself. proprietary volume indicator by esignal select bar with highest volume as per formula ( described in article), draw lines at high and low and carry on lines until next bar of such kind is found then connect them...Indicator can serve as defining trend, support and resistance, supply/demand or just simple focus trade around such important bar...Even this strategy by Albertdkpllh can fit in.... I have this indicator in esignal but looking for MT4 version because i want to have alert when high volume bar found..... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...98#post9082398 Thank you for any help. --------------- Albertdkpllh sorry for posting something unrelated to this thread, just looking for someone willing to code this simple indicator...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh I may be wrong on this but on hepsibahs chart, depending on the Zig Zag settings, there is a HH a couple of candles after the low. That higher high is to early for an up leg to be formed, it will prevent the Zig Zag forming on a Stoch 100 until its broken. So the blue arrows formed at Stoch 100, and an up leg formed at the first one to break the first higher high. Why a dissimilarity could be considered as having occured before breaking the higher high beats me, certainly a Stoch 100 and no up leg after the HH would be of interest. 'Hepsibah....At each blue arrow, the stoch has printed a reading of 100 but the ZZ has not (yet) printed an extension of the up leg (or a new up leg if the previous leg was down) i.e. a point of dissimilarity exists. Eurusdd's claim was that the ZZ would, at some point in time, print a high at or beyond the point of dissimilarity. Vice versa for the red arrows.'...................................//..end quote....Again price would have to make a new HH before a new up leg....why would EURUSDD consider that as a dissimalarity? So my question would be, how would we know whether price is going to go up or down before it breaks the first HH? We don't, or at least I don't. After the break of the HH (or dissimilarity), then perhaps we may have a better idea. I haven't read his old thread, maybe the dissimilarity is just a HH or LL before the ZigZag has a chance of forming the first leg. M.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
This is a quote from Eurusdd on the original thread "Because in cases where stoch got to 0/100 and the current candle closed with stoch = 0/100 and no ZZ, then the chance that the previous ZZ will repaint is very high." On the chart, you can see that this is true. When stoch=100 and there is no extension of the ZZ leg at that point (blue arrow), there is a very high probability that price will go higher and an extension of the ZZ will appear - look to the right of a blue arrow and most of the time you will see a higher ZZ leg. Vice versa for down legs, for every red arrow there is a high probability that you will see a lower ZZ leg to the right. I have added an indicator that shows when these fail - the black, larger arrows show when the previous signal failed. There are three failures on this chart out of around 50 total signals. So we can deduce that, for this period on the EU chart, the probability of a price going higher than a blue arrow or lower than a red arrow was 94%. So what can we do with this information? We could just trade every blue and red arrow and, if they fail, either take a SL or hold until price returns (as it almost surely will but there is uncertainty as to when and how far it will move away in the future). Or , we could ask ourselves what the chance of consecutive failures is given a hit rate of 94% - it is miniscule. So, we could wait for a failure and only trade the next signals. Or we could trade a mixture. Given the large number of opportunities every day, there is most certainly a number of ways to develop a profitable strategy. I have attached the indicator that shows failures - please note that the arrow is drawn on the arrow following the failure

PTZ and NTZ theorem

--- 帖子 #92 ---
It seems to me that everything is becoming unnecessarily complicated...human nature I guess. Keep it simple, keep only what is needed, dump the rest and that will allow you to remain focussed more easily. Ref post 70....not much needed to make a decision. I have shown an extract of hepsibah post above zoomed out a bit. I have purposely removed any buy signals from the chart to add clarity and allows the focus only on selling because that is what the main semaphore is telling me. If it helps, then as I suggested in post 70, knock yourself up a basic template using semaphor and the stochzzmismatch as I did and in 5 minutes you would have the same as me. Mine is configured for my own taste, colours etc that's the only difference, my description previously still applies to build your own, I won't supply it. Also note, I have purposely reversed the candle colours to help identify pull backs, but that is purely my preference. Any now here's that m5 chart with a few notes. LL Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thank you for the explanation. I am learning form you and forgive me for coming back to the same issues again and again. To make things simple lets keep to Highs(H). When I started trading initially, the ZZ was my only tool. I waited for a ZZ leg to first appear then I traded in that direction hoping that it will keep repainting in that direction which it usually did, just like your arrows show. I agree with you on that, but when we add the stoch for a relation with the ZZ then that is similarity and not a mismatch. Lets try to understand the quote " Because in cases where stoch got to 0/100 and the current candle closed with stoch = 0/100 and no ZZ, then the chance that the previous ZZ will repaint is very high " But in which direction will the repaint occur??? I will use a very recent trade to explain this quote. I took a sell for this trade, I panicked and closed the trade. At the last ZZ repaint, Stoch was at 100, the next time stoch was at 100 there was no ZZ leg and this is because price did not move higher than the previous leg. This is a rare event/ mismatch. In this picture the repaint did occur but not a higher repaint, it was lower than the previous but it was not a ZZ leg for a low either. At the time I took the trade I knew for sure that if price went higher than the previous ZZ leg, ZZ will repaint higher but as stoch remain at 100 and there was no repaint of the ZZ( price could not go higher) I was certain of the drop and I was sure that this kind of repaint will occur, bcause ZZ =25 meant that the leg had to appear somewhere. That is what usually happens in these rare events. I closed that trade to stay out of the confusion which eventually would have played to my expectations. It is okay to trade the arrows or the ZZ leg when it first appears but it was not sustainable for me especially when the market was ranging widely. I know we are on the same page . Others should not worry too much, we know what we are doing. Thanks Hepsibah. Again, I may be wrong. Al

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Landline, have you tried that strategy in live? How is your result? I tried that before but ZZ semafore is reapinting. On your chart it seems it was just simple and easy to find your entry but thats not the case. Thats why we need the stoch as Albert pointed out.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
on chart you have written : "we khnow it is downward"....How you could be sure that this main semaphor on your chart is the last one and will not repaint again itself in higher price??

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I have used semaphore for years and naturally it repaints. So what... the point is not to enter on the semaphore....understand that point very clearly! Set up your chart as described, run it for youself. I cannot convince you by talking, nor can anybody else, just trust the main window information, because the second window can only add confusion as can be seen by the conflicting posts concerning stochastic already.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi Landline sorry I beg to differ. The semaphore and the ZZ are the same. You are attempting to pick tops and bottoms blindly and one day it will bite you where it hurts most. Al. And please in your picture you do not know it is a down trend.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
If it goes higher and repaints, then guess what....im out...pretty straightforward isn't it?

No one can know anything for sure, but trading is about gaining an edge...surely you realise that

Albert, how about using HA?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I'll leave you at this point. As with all strategies, it is important to find one that suits you. I have long been a fan of this one (94% in my book is good enough) and Albert has given me new ideas to possibly enhance that probability for which I am grateful. For those who are looking at mismatches being reversals - be aware that you will be correct around 6% of the time and so you may want to consider more filters.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
No more filters are needed the way that I have stochzzmismatch set up, and when combined with semaphore and reverse candle colour is all that is needed. Carefully look at how my chart looks and you will notice that I also have your mismatch indicator reversed as well! It looks a good tool I must say ...thank you for that.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Well the signa by HA seems to be earlier and the SAR is more stable. I prefer the SAR.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Have a blessed Sunday Albert. You brought many cheers and much happiness to many members here.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
EURUSDD:There are two ways to trade under the similarity-umbrella. You can wait for the lines to disagree and then MARK the price for a return! But that does not happen often so you will not have many trades a day!!! The other way: Since the lines will look exactly the same &gt;97% of the time, TRADE WITH THAT EXPECTATION!!!! When the stoch is ahead of or behind the main price - Place your trade expecting stoch to agree with price eventually. You will get many trades that way. Money-management of course. I can get 100 wins in a role that way!! price is leader!!! it means Albert is trying to use by 97% probability !!!! Albert looks at the price(zigzag) as a leader and when stochastic goes to 0/100 and new zag not to be created(3%) and price decides to be back(SAR signal), then he expects stoch goes on follow of price(97%) ,and it means position by reverse in 0/100 stoch(or in other hand means repaint the last exist zig)!!!!!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Stochastics and zig-zag was one of my favorite methods to scalp some pips back in the days when I was a newer trader and I remember the best entries was that with parabolic, I never tried to trade how Al in this thread does and I see that this method gives not enough signals to trade, but profitable. I want to share an indicator I use to see where the last leg of zig-zag indicator repainted it is in this post DT_ZZ it's called http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...61#post7189561 it can help you check back history and doesn't repaint.

Interesting thread, thanks for it. Re. EURUSD H1, I believe it was a valid signal a few bars ago. Have you taken the short? Someone asked but I think it wasn't answered. When do you open the position? After H1 bar closes with PSAR confirmation and you open the position at the open price of the next bar? There is a buy signal on USDCHF H1, by the way. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Al will probably see USDCHF the same as you I think, but for me I'd only be interested in selling on the h1 t/f at least because the sem is showing me that. I don't have an entry yet tho.....and don't want to confuse people with my basic style either but thought it worth showing, describing, illustrating with real orders a simplistic approach which may well arrive at a similar conclusion to Als method (perhaps/perhaps not) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

No worries....but re USDCHF why would anyone want to buy when we also have AB=CD kind of pattern suggesting if anything that sell is the smart move in the nearish future....how do you see it? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #125 ---
So, Landline what entry are you waiting? I can see a red dot there. Isnt it thats a signal for entry as you have mentioned in your previous post.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Yeah that could easily have been an entry had I been watching that pair at that time, but not a problem at all, I will wait for the next pull back, there are plenty of opportunities on a daily basis....but hey I'm just lucky after all

Re. your system, I agree with Al, therefore no comment. Maybe you can open your own thread and discuss your entries over there instead of distracting people here. Because your system has nothing to do with Al's. Regards, Blackeagle

I am not the cop. I am just telling you nicely that what you are doing is a distraction. You shared your opinion, thread owner answered you and disagreed with you and pointed out repeatedly (if you'd understand) that your system has nothing to do with his, and also tried to help you that you'd lose your shirt if you continue to trade that way. Then what is the point to keep posting new charts here? Please show respect to the thread owner and share your ideas that are not related to this system somewhere else. Simple is that. If you wanna fight, don't worry, I won't give you one. Regards, Blackeagle

You wanna fight, then you'll do it with Forex Factory admin as you've been complained due to name calling and swearing. First read Al's posts, and then look at your own system and what you discuss and try to understand, if you can, if there is any similarity except the indis you use.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
An analysis of the trades I took today. You will see I took a sell based on the rule: stoch at 100 no ZZ leg, parabolic sell entry. This was an excellent setup. It did not go down enough to force a lower repaint of the ZZ leg. Stoch closed at zero. At this point I should have been looking for a parabolic buy whilst trailing my SL with the parabolic, this would have reduced my Loss slightly. But I am in the buy now and this is also per the entry rules.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hello Landline, I want to appreciate the fact that you have a simple and effective system of trading with similar components like ZZ, Stoch et al. But i would like to point out that Albert has his own style of system set up which is different from yours. If your system is simpler in execution, all the more power to you. As a novice and as someone who is interested in learning more about Albert System, i find posts of your system distracting. I request you to please open a different thread. Thanks

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I have a very very simple solution for you....ignore me and my posts!...viola..... there now that weren't too difficult was it

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks Albert for posting quite a few charts and for the regular updates. Just getting a feel of your style now and i have lot of demoing to do. If i may ask, 1. What is the significance of choosing 25 as the number of periods? 2. If we choose a different period like, say 15, does the stop loss also needs to be the High or Low of the previous 15 candles? Have a nice day. Thanks

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Landline, Permit me to expand on my original post. By opening your own thread, and not causing confusion in the original thread is about showing respect to the original thread owner Albert and his efforts. So, again i sincerely request you to please open a separate thread and post your system and trades which i would be happy to follow. Thanks

--- 帖子 #160 ---
OK...2 points that you need to take on board 1. You are not the only one here....your request is selfish towards others that happen to like alternatives to a theme 2' As before, you are not a policeman...if Al wants me to stop posting, then I'll respect that and stop posting immediately, but your request doesn't matter

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Tough questions Aaven. 2. Yes. 1. You have to strike a balance for many factors. Remember I use the ZZ for trend direction, a small ZZ will give a smaller SL size, and too many signals.....better for scalpers. A big ZZ say 100 will give a bigger trend (pips) but a bigger initial SL. These are just few factors to consider......now you have to factor the stoch and it must be as close as possible to the ZZ. In fact it should be the same as the ZZ. My setting are fine for 1H and higher, I take maybe 70 to 120 pips depending on the market. Al.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
​How many pairs do You watch?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hello Landline, I think you misunderstood me. Let me help you in clarifying the situation. Permit me to quote you: "1. You are not the only one here....your request is selfish towards others that happen to like alternatives to a theme" We are actually on the same page. Many a thread on FF was abandoned by the thread starter, when they felt the behavior of the thread followers did not show appreciation for the effort and generosity of thread starter. I am sure everyone is interested in alternatives to a theme and i am interested in knowing more about how you trade. My request is for the benefit of everyone who is following this thread as it is my belief that your trading although shares some components to Albert's, it is different. If i am right, there was an memeber who already pointed out this to you. 2. As before, you are not a policeman...if Al wants me to stop posting, then I'll respect that and stop posting immediately, but your request doesn't matter. I am not sure why you got so angry. I and many others want to learn from the experienced ones. I welcome everyone's posts and i look for opportunities to enhance my knowledge. It's my sincere request that you open a separate thread where we can follow your way of trading. Again, i want you to post and i am looking forward to learning, but could you show some concern for everyone here and start a new thread. Have a nice day. Thanks

Thanks Albert for the quick reply. Kindly guide us on this point: "These are just few factors to consider......now you have to factor the stoch and it must be as close as possible to the ZZ. In fact it should be the same as the ZZ." 1. When you say, stoch must be as close as possible to the ZZ, we are talking about the periods of ZZ being same as the stoch? 2. So, if one were to tinker around the settings, would this be the example of the process ? Step 1: Identify the Stop Loss one has an appetite for. As higher ZZ periods--&gt;Higher SL and higher PIPS. Step 2: Identify the number of periods for ZZ that matches Step 1. Step 3: For the stochastic enter the same periods as in Step 2. Thanks once again Good Sir for your benevolence.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Landline, as a more seasoned trader, user in general in the markets and member of ff , let me just point out to you, that you are in the wrong. This is Als thread for his system, what you are doing although similar is not Als system. There is a feature called "Create new thread" I suggest you take advantage of it. What you are doing has completely sent users off track completely. No wonder the newbies in here are confused. Best Wishes to you Al, and good luck.

Full marks for a well composed response from you and I respect that. I do not have time to manage a thread, let me make that clear There was no anger in my last response whatsoever. but there was a degree of frustration a) why you are unable to disregard any post of mine you see...problem solved b) why should I allow myself to be railroaded out of town...unless the sheriff requests it Either a) or b) would/should satisfy you, but at present you have only option a)..... yet you're like a dog with a bone on a mission to achieve b) I guess with enough rallying from you then Al may well feel pressured into asking me to go which I would of course. I don't have any desire to discuss this with you any further

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Ok let me make it easy on Al......anything for a quiet life lol.....im gone

--- 帖子 #170 ---
You are on the right track. Remember your SL is not fixed, very ofthen the initial SL may be big and as time passes the SL reduces too. You must know how much loss you can accommodate per trade. Then you could move to the other factors in tweaking your parameters. And yes, I am refering to the periods. I lost 40 pips today but it went at least +10pips in my favour............can you be successful with +10pips???? I could have a win rate of about 100% if I were taking 1-2pips with this system. ...again what do you really want (you have to consider all of this). This system will give you that edge, the rest is up to you. Al

Hi Albert and all, thanks for sharing your system I would like to try your system in demo mode and i was looking for one of your previous trade i m a little bit confused about it, on the first blue line i think the sar turn too late after the sto touched zero level, so my question is after how many candle you will not enter to the trade when the SAR turn without new legs ? And on the second line why did you not take the trade, according that there was not new leg, sto was 100 and the sar turn for sell ? And by the way are you looking your 11 pairs each hours to check set up ? Thank you ^^

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Ockham, I took that sell slightly late. The blue line is not a signal, the red is a signal. I only monitor those with a potential signal developing closely. Good morning.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Albert, thank you for answer, so the blue line is not a signal because too far from the sto zero right ? so how many candles do you accept from the sto signal to the SAR signal ? have a good day.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
if anyone wants to practice this and gets a little impatient waiting for signals, it works on all tf's. This one would have made around 3 pips - but they all add up.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Here's another just happened. SL at a new up leg, TP at new down leg

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks Hepsibah. You have a good strategy. How do you manage the SL?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I see you are on the 1m TF. what parameters are you using?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
That's not Al's signal.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I am reversing to the original preambles. I wanted a short cut, but its hurting me. ZZ = Stoch, ZZ must be =to stoch. The signals will be rare but solid with very tight SL. The principle is clear, what ever values you take for the ZZ must be equal to the stoch. I am working on some values and will share when am finished. Al

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I am so sorry, I thought that the two trades I just posted were according to Al's strategy, I must have misunderstood. They were both on 1m with both zz and stoch=18

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Al trades the repainting ZZ leg. In your examples he would go long if stoch was @ 0 and no ZZ leg. That is, if I'm not mistaking. And I mistake a LOT!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hey hepsibah, thanks for your posts and thanks Albert for this thread (after quite a while something interesting on FF! ). I am wondering would it not be better to leave the trade running until the zigzag starts showing an opposite leg (up in your example), rather than indicating a trend (start of the leg down) in the trade direction? The SL is fixed here, why restrict the profit potential? Best, k

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hey kprsa, How are you? I actually still use this strategy sometimes when I'm trading manually (usually leave it to EAs these days) but I always use the stoch as the direction i.e. trade in the direction of the arrows. But Albert has opened my eyes to another possibility when the trades turns against you and I'd thought I was showing examples of these but seem to have missed the point. I didn't want to clog up the thread any more with the way I trade it so was just trying to find examples of Albert's strategy but think I blew it - duh!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Well thanks! I am, after all, an expert student of WTF Over.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I actually believe this is goldust so I am going to risk trying Albert's patience one more time in the hopes a few lighbulbs may go off. The easiest way to see this is to set up a 1m chart with only the post-zigzag and the stochzzmismatch v2 indicators (you can find both by clicking the paperclip top right if you haven't already got them). Change the colours of the post-zigzag so the top colour is None - this leaves the actual zigzag off as it it is clearer that way. Set the values of the post-zag and the stochZZmismatch v2 to be the same. I have them all set to 18 in the chart below. When a vertical line appears it shows that both the stoch and the zigzag are in agreement (we have similarity). When an up arrow appears, it shows that we have stoch=100 but there has been no new up movement in the zigzag (dissimilarity). When a down arrow appears, it shows that stoch=0 but there has been no new down movement in the zigzag (dissimilarity). What happens after an up dissimilarity bar &gt;90% of the time is that the zigzag will subsequently move up and there will be a bar where we have similarity again. What happens after a down dissimilarity bar &gt;90% of the time is that the zigzag will subsequently move down and there will be a bar where we have similarity again. Let this sink in and then watch it - it's a monster. Works on all tf's but easiest to see it happening real time on the 1m. In the &lt;10% of cases where this fails, we have Albert's system to bail us out though I obviously haven't quite got the hang of it yet. Here's an example but better to watch it in real time.

EURCAD, H1 Chart, Bought 8 bars ago @1.4694 + buffer, still running in profit and trailing. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Everything is fine, thanks! Now I think I understand you: So in case of a further extension of ZZ leg, almost certainly at some point the arrow would have appeared which you'd use for the entry by your alternate system. In a sense you're taking care of both trend and choppy regime of the market. Very clever! I am interested in what you have to say: your contributions are always constructive. While I possibly do not see things the same way, I always learn something new. All the best, k

Very interesting system indeed and I will definitely backtest it. Can someone please tell me how usually is the trades' risk to reward ratio? And I wish to trade this on H4 and daily ONLY. Mark

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi Hepsibah, thanks for your contribution to the thread. Following explanation is for you as well as others who try to get hang of it. As you can see from EURCAD H1 chart I attached, zigzag is up, therefore we are looking for a long trade. Red vertical line is where stoch is 0 when zigzag is still up. The red arrow shows the lowest low for down swing and if you go 25 bars back (because zigzag value is 25), the low of red arrow is higher than blue arrow, therefore there was no new leg down on zigzag. Anyway this is how zigzag works (for newbies, btw). Since there was no new zigzag leg down and stoch is already touched 0, we are looking for SAR to confirm the trade. At yellow vertical line, we open a long trade with SAR confirmation. This is basically how Al's system works. Hope this helps. ps. I am using a different confirmation method other than SAR and I'm also using a trailing method to ride the trend as long as I get exit signal. For this particular trade, entry was @1.4694 and price is now @1.4802 and my position is still open and trailing. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I will try it, but can you post pictures from the settings? Not really clear for me what have you set. Thanks Michael

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Many thanks for that Blackeagle. Got it now I think. Not many of them I think, especially when stoch and ZZ values are the same.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I think this will work better if we set ZZ with double the value of STC. Also, We need ZZSTC mismatch v2 and ZZSTC Fails with Alerts or an EA...uhhgg... I wish I can code &gt;__&lt;

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Here you have mismatch v2 with alerts. Blue up arrows are the sell alerts, red down arrows are the buy alerts.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
MismatchV2 seems to have a bug. Arrows appear at places where no arrow should appear. Here V1 with Alerts.

Thanks for sharing this strategy. I used it profitably this morning. My difficulty with it is management of the trade in ranging markets. SL placement, TP etc. I think I understand the entries.......the rest is the issue.

Thanks for such a concise explanation of the system.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I am tempted to agree with you on setting ZZ with double the value of stoch. I am using 60 for the ZZ and 30 for the Stoch. 1am here. Good morning...... Getting into bed now.

Thankyou GU-Night!!!possible to make it multi time?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Version 1 of StochZZmismatch is really a Stoch/HHLL mismatch i.e. it shows an arrow when stoch=100 but there is no HH or when stoch=0 and there is no LL Version 2 looks for a new ZZ termination and you can check that the arrows are correct by putting on the post-zigzag indicator to show where new ZZ terminations would have appeared historically. Watch it in real time and you can see that it is correct - the post zigzag lines will not repaint once the bar is closed. ZZ looks for more than just a simple HHLL. It doesn't really matter which you use, the anomalies occur because the stoch indicator uses close prices and the ZZ (and HHLL) uses high/low prices. Many thanks for the alerts.

I agree, entries are easy, it's the exits that are the challenge. I only enter when the close of the bar is far enough away to give me a profit when the next ZZ termination will appear. Usually I will take profit as soon as the new ZZ appears but I will hold for longer if I have a previously marked level. If the trade fails i.e. there is a mismatch or new ZZ leg in the opposite direction, I am quite relaxed as the probability is so high that this price will be returned to, it gives me a new level for tp in the future. If I'm on 1m tf, I'll usually hold the failed trade while taking the trades in the new direction since the level is usually returned to quite quickly. Htf's however can take a while and so, unless your trades are very small and you have deep pockets, it's probably better to take the hit and mark them for the future. The last two days have been quite good, let's see what the rest of the week brings

Thanks. Lets see how the rest of the week goes.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thanks Albert for your advice. Have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi Albert and all the rest, Thank you for your participation and all the efforts you make in sharing your work. It is realy helpfull. To be true i have been trading since 2002 and still being a failure. I quited the forex many times and come back many times, and again i am back, because i have learned that " THE ONE WHO NEVER QUIT WILL FINALY WIN " I like this system for its simpllcity and i am here to learn and share. See you then ....

--- 帖子 #212 ---
My first trade on UJ went straight to the stop loss this morning. Just took another trade but i adapted the settings a little bit. I entered not on the Parabolic Sar but on the little divergence. I put STO 33, 1, 1 and ZigZag 33, 1, 1 Lets see

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Winner180, Just want to share my 2 cents. It goes without saying, that Albert must have spent countless hours in researching, fine tuning the system before zeroing in on the current settings. I think it's only fair that we demo the system with the original settings at-least in the nascent stages. Of course, once we get some screen time, everyone could add their own personality vis a vis tweaking the settings or adding or removing certain trading elements. Good Luck Man and keep posting your trades... Thanks

--- 帖子 #214 ---
hepsibah, have fun with it and make good money. Thanks for it.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
YESSSSSSSSSSS You are right. Happy Trade to everybody .....

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hello Ion, What's the significance of setting ZZ with twice the value of stochastic? Thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Albert Sir, Kindly share your insights if possible about the significance of the mismatch of stochastic and Zig Zag from a market behavior of point of view. I mean does the point of dissimilarity has anything to do with a retracement, area of value, key supply or demand zone, cluster of S/L's or something along these lines? Have a nice Day. Thanks

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Thanks for the inputs Black Eagle. "I'm also using a trailing method to ride the trend as long as I get exit signal. " Could you please explain this point of yours. Do you mean ride the trend till the next leg of ZZ appears? And if possible do share the alternate confirmation you are using. Thanks

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Perhaps the image will help.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
By the way here is a ZZ indicator that shows historical Dots of where the ZZ leg started. (Credits goes to the guy who made it available in public) Helps a lot for visual back test.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
If you use different values You are not trading Al's system. The whole point is they should be the same.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Okay then, I understand. If it's the same value you get higher probabilities.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Not saying Your settings wont work. Maybe It's better. It's just not 'dissimilarity'.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Al, Thanks for sharing your system. ​ Have you changed your parameters for Zigzag &amp; Stock from (25,1,1 &amp; 18,1,1) to (60,1,1 &amp; 30,1,1)? Please clarify.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Noted with thanks...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi Albert, Is it possible to mean something when we have STO showing a new HL when on the chart we have a LL ? Just a question. Thank You.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
No Sir.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Okay, what I learnt is PRICE IS KING. So we watch the price 24/7. The Zig zag shows price in action (HL HH LL LH etc, am sure you can develop everything else from just that..... S/R etc.) The Stoch is an oscillator that helps in finding overbought/oversold zones. What we are doing here is trying to cage price ( put price within bounds) left alone price can go anywhere freely on the charts. Now we have mapped price(ZZ) to the Stoch ( with boundaries 0/100) so that they may be interpreted the same such that when a ZZ leg appears stoch must be at 0/100, once this is established we have a relationship, something that we can make reference to 90% of the time. You asked about the point of dissimilarity: That point is the most important information you can have looking at the charts. They are strong everything....S/R, Supply/demand......etc but I see them basically as turning points and trend continuation levels (classic divergence/Hidden divergence)........... thus with all parameters equal. I don't know much but I hope this helps. Al

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Only when values are the same.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #232 ---
No problem .....

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thank you Albert Sir, Those are great insights.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks a bunch Ion.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I want to share another twist. More to follow soon. Al

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Lets look at these charts. Stoch is 30, ZZ 30, kind of a Donchian channel 30, HA candles. All the charts show turning points.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi Al Very interesting approach, my current system chart setup has both stochs and Zigzag and they are set with different values and they still produce the signals you have explained, very clever Regarding the above. I read all of EurUSD threads and they were long and hard to follow so I am one of those that missed your highlighted points. Could you help please, I think the price top is confirmed if the 100 stoch occurs with no higher ZZ, is that the point you mention and the trend continuation is the same principal. So for an uptrend the 0 Stoch shows the ZZ not showing a LL hence it continues up, the opposite but same principal happens for a downtrend. Have I grasped the points you raised, if not could you put me straight Kind regards

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Now just to simplify things, we have already established the relatioshionship between the ZZ and Stoch. Now lets focus on the ZZ and the Channel. They both have the same period (30)......Now we have established that wherever the ZZ is there is a dot on the channel...... Whenever the ZZ repaints it should leave a dot. But you will find isolated dots that do not relate to the ZZ. Those are the dissimilaties that we are looking for. I hope the picture below will throw more light.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
You are spot on.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Second picture........Turning points.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Do you see the opportunities.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
As for me one of the advantages of this system is that you can have small stop losses with big profits. Since you can get almost and may be more than 90% of winning trades, so everything will be great.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Al , Great job you are doing here. Is it possible for you to attach the donchian channel indi? I don't think it's donchian. As It does not produce the same result. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi Al, 1. Your system is to find the dissimilarity between ZZ &amp; STO &amp; place the trade assuming ZZ &amp; STO will have similarity 2. But, Refer your post # 236, 238 &amp; 241 images, i guess you have marked the similarity places Please correct me, if i am wrong.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
This looks good Albert!!! Can you attach your Indies and templates please? Let's test it!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks you chief for all your contributions and showing the light to many a traders.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Here you go.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Please this is another angle and has nothing to do with the Stoch.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Good day.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanks.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Really interesting methodology.... in 2014 was trying to understand what EURUSDD was talking about but it was just to early with this kind of knowledge for me.... you Al and hepsibah enlighten me with this concept.... thank you very much

--- 帖子 #252 ---
can we use it on higher time frame? a very promising one. what profit target shld we look at Albert? thanks for sharing this promising strategy

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Albert, many thanks for sharing. Seems you have entered late there? isnt it supposed to enter on the first red HA?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
You are right. It should have been the first red HA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Just looking at possible trades for the day. No time for trading today.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Albert Sir, Could you please share some light on the basis of how the isolated dots are being generated? I mean, is it due to the mismatch between the stoch and zig zag or due to the combination of zig zag and the channel or something else? Thanks

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I see it's become even more complicated now....with more additional indicators lol. I was derided by several because I was reducing everything to something workable and easy to trade, yet now all I see is confusion and indecision, and the really funny part is that further simplicity and clarification was about to be explained before the "cops" arrived on the scene Maybe I'll create a journal one day when I have time to show the various methods I use that gathers the important information but in an easy to use package. I'll get out the way now cos I can hear the sirens and see the blue lights flashing already

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hello Hepsibah, Thanks for your valuable contribution to the thread and for your inputs. If time permits, could you explain with a chart on how you take the profit. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
To our commander in chief Albert...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I want you here. Please stay. But you know you've got to behave. Lol. We can learn a thing or two. With lots of love.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Aaven, The isolated dots show where the ZZ was. its not too different from the history ZZ indicators that have been shared by friends here. Like the ZZ it marks the H/L of the period( 30 in this case). So it is directly related to the ZZ. A dot appears if that candle stick goes higher or lower than the previous 30 candles just like the ZZ. I hope its clear. Al.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi Aaven, Unless I have a previously marked level that I am aiming for, I will exit when a new ZZ termination point appears. It is easiest to demonstrate this using the post-zigzag indicator that shows where new ZZ legs (or extensions to existing legs) appeared. So, on the chart below, I enter long on the close of a bar with a blue arrow and exit on the appearance of a blue line. If either a red line (indicating a down leg) or a red arrow appears (indicating stoch=0 but no down leg) I'll close the trade at a loss but mark the entry price as a level that has a high probability of being returned to.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
The probability of price going higher than a blue entry or lower than a red entry is &gt;90% but some entries make for a better chance of profit than others. The main reason the dissimilarities occur is because the stoch is showing values of zero and 100 when a lower or higher CLOSE occurs but this does not necessarily mean that a higher high or a lower low also occurs on the same bar which is what the ZZ is looking for. So a good entry for me would be when you can see there is room for a profit because it is either a blue signal and the high of the signal bar is lower than the previous ZZ up leg or when it's a red signal and the low of the signal bar is higher than the previous ZZ down leg. And if the close of the signal bar is a significant distance from the high/low of the bar, so much the better.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Thankyou hepsibah! good presentation!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Suck-up​

--- 帖子 #266 ---
thanks arya. Both the post-zigzag and the stoch are set to 18 in the above examples. It is worth experimenting with different lookback lengths but I think this method works best when the settings are the same on both.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hello Albert, I just want to reconfirm, perhaps i should have specified more clearly. I meant to say, the dots that are in opposite direction of the zig zag leg. The below is from one of your posts. I am referring to the highlighted portion. So are these dots mismatch or are they showing where zig zag was. Part of my confusion is due to the fact that some time back, i used a zig zag indicator on a different platform which behaved slightly different, i think it was using a percentage of move as a reference. Just getting used to MT4 indicator. Sorry for asking for reclarification again. Thanks

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hepsibah, Thanks for going out of your way to share your inputs. Will go through them. Much obliged.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
If showing gratitude to a man who has taken serious effort and time to educate traders is being termed as Suck Up. By all means, I am one.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Even more suck-upier.​

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Please, a journal would be a good read.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi hepsibah. Can You add one parameter to ver.2 of the indi? The distance between arrow and candle. Thanx.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Those are mismatches. Sorry about the confusion

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Al, I have a question for you. Attached is USDCHF M5. After the green dot, I sold at the first red HA. Then another pink dot appeared without zigzag changing. After this pink dot, do we suppose to exit our short and go long at the first green HA? Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Re. above situation, now a second pink dot appeared. If we are long after the first pink dot with green HA, what do we do now? Please advise. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi BE, i want to share my view regarding your question above, but im sure Albert explaination will be good than me. I will sell on green dot, however when pink dot appear, i will exit and waiting if there any new zig zag leg created even the stoch reach 00. I think market will go down more since no zig zag created, maybe the zig zag leg will extend to new low.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Thank You Albert Sir.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Blackeagle, you are right. The first green dot indicated a trend continuation, and luckily for you stoch was at 100 but no ZZ, however the market did not go far enough. It created another dot with no ZZ again stoch was at 0. I will exit the sell and take the buy ( Turning point set up). SL at the last ZZ leg, am sure it will be a small SL....

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Now when this happens you stay put and trust your probabilty of 90+% will hold otherwise it will hit your SL. Accept it and move on.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Took this trade this morning. Entered late

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thanks for the replies. I opened another short on AUDUSD M5. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #282 ---
And this is the long trade on EURJPY M15. Regards, Blackeagle ps. Bought @ 113.95, stopped out @ 113.87 when zigzag extended.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks. I just took this trade too.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Just got stopped out. -8 pips

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Would the white line be a correct candle to sell on? Aud/Nzd 5 minute chart

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Yes, there was also EURCAD M5 buy trade. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
So far, today, I had 4 trades and all stopped out. I didn't take EURCAD trade but it was stopped out, too. Only AUDNZD trade (I didn't take this one either) is open now and moving around entry price. Most of these trades were turning point trades. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Aud/Nzd got stopped out!

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Many Thanks to you Albert. Through your thread i discovered the Similarity and Dis-Similarity introduced years ago by EurUsdd. I spent my week end reading through it, i am around the hundreds pages and i still have a lot to learn, but even at that level i have learnt a lot and my trading is improving fast. You are doing a great work by re-introducing that way of trading. Many Thanks .....

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I understand you. But I don't think we need to take Al's word hook line and sinker. We need to test this setup on demos first until we are reasonably sure of what we are doing. One thing I have discovered in Forex is that you have to tweak any giving trading strategy to suit yourself if you decided to go for it. I have checked Al's tweak, Landline's and anyone that caught my interest. Since I saw this thread, I made great improvements in my trades. Demo though. I will only goes live with this after series of testings. I will drop my present demo and open another one. After that i will go live with this strategy if it suits me. Just this morning taking little trades. Note that i really started trading on this demo on the 9th of September. A day after Al started this tread. I cant really say i have figured anything out yet. Just trying.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Wolero7, Good Luck with your demoing. I see that there are various time frames that you are using, but what is the time frame for the results and what time frame do you prefer? Thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Took some other trades after the first post above. Though it's a bit risky. But that what Forex is all about.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I trade using semafor and post zig zag posted here on 30min , 5 mins and 1 mins. This is how my chart looks like and other trades i took. I will not want to discuss anything aside this for now. So as not to derail the thread. The reason am just posting this is to appreciate Al's effort and encourage anyone to test strategy out thoroughly before going live. I use close all script to close all trades. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thanks for sharing. Make sure you keep up this good work!!!! .

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Albert Sir, In one of your posts you mentioned that the latest version is a new angle and has nothing to do with the stochastic. About the dots that are being generated: " Like the ZZ it marks the H/L of the period( 30 in this case). So it is directly related to the ZZ. A dot appears if that candle stick goes higher or lower than the previous 30 candles just like the ZZ." Kindly advise me on where i have missed the point: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1. In a ZZ down move, pink dots are the places where ZZ has been. So it means a pink dot represents the lowest low of the past 30 periods at that given moment. If on subsequent candles the candles keep going lower than the previous 30 candles new pink dots would be generated. This principle is same for green dots when the ZZ is on a up move except the green dot being the highest high of the last 30 periods. 2.My confusion is on a down move, what is the concept behind/ How are the Green Dots (Dis-Similarity) being generated? I mean, a green dot represents the highest high over the last 30 periods. So during a down move of ZZ, shouldn't the appearance of green dot indicate the start of a New ZZ leg in the upward direction. Since by definition, a new up ward zig zag is drawn when the high of last 30 periods is broken? 3. Is stochastic relevant to this system or can we just ignore it? 4. This Donchian channel is different from the standard right, how did you come up with the tweaking? 5. For S/L are we trail the last 30 periods high/low or is the ZZ High or Low? Thanks for your patience. Sir, I know too many questions, kindly take your own time to answer me.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Aaven, I understand your confusion. Its my fault to have introduced this. Its a lot to explain how the indi works especially that I do not have all the facts......It relates to the ZZ and the Stoch in that they all can be visibly mapped to one another. It could be traded with the ZZ alone, but not with the Stoch. I could give another example of how the ZZ and the bollinger bands could be traded but that will further confuse us all. I think our aim is to make pips......I have to appologise for introducing other things. Lets get simple. I entreat us all to stick with the ZZ-Stoch setups and possibly maintain the same values for both, it works. Al.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
My last trades yesterday were the hardest for the day. Just closed them now. At a point I was down by the first picture attached until it eventually went north. Still working on a better entry system. To be successful, one need a good MM system too.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi Albert, One of my favorite indicator is Bollinger Band, could you explain how to use ZZ along with BB? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Albert Sir, Please don't feel that way. You have been exceptionally patient with your guidance and very generous with your time. The confusion is at my end due to the fact that i am new to trading,especially new to forex and I am a bit of a slow learner. We all appreciate what you have done already and look eagerly to your different flavors of the system. It would give us a chance to put our brain to work thus embedding the original concepts. So kindly keep educating us with different ways of looking at the market. Thanks

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Albert Sir, Quoting You: "Its a lot to explain how the indi works especially that I do not have all the facts......It relates to the ZZ and the Stoch in that they all can be visibly mapped to one another. It could be traded with the ZZ alone, but not with the Stoch." Kindly let me know if i understood this correctly, if not please correct me: 1. When we say Indi and that it relates to the ZZ and Stoch and that they all can be visibly mapped to one another: Do we mean that generation of the pink and green dots whether Similar or Dis Similar has to do with certain calculation vis a vis ZZ and Stoch. So if we were to look under the hood of the Indi we would find Stochastic and ZZ? 2. "It could be traded with the ZZ alone, but not with the Stoch." Since the Indi takes the ZZ and Stoch into account for generation of dots, there is no need for adding or using the Stochastic at bottom? Thanks Sir

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Confusion obviously still continues to reign hahaha. Hardly anyone listened to me as I was gradually detailing how to effectively trade, and as I said before, I was hounded out by idiots for making it too simple ​. How ironic that now most are realising that I was right in the first place, ie you don't need stochastic, and you you don't need zz (semaphore does the same job but cleaner in my view). Anything used, particularly in the window is no more than second-hand information which is already present in the main window, so why rely on second-hand is my point...it doesn't make sense for the purpose of this strategy...think about it! I offered a basic method here, which works well enough using the slimmed down use of Als method as I described earlier. My advice to those who are now unclear or unsure what to do, is to return to my basic layout and start afresh. There are a number of ways to trade in my manner and I use variants depending upon certain things, one for example being at what stage of the week I am in. I won't go into that here btw. I always try to be constructive towards less experienced traders when appropriate, but as you will know, I have zero patience with anyone who is negative, selfish, hypocrical, overly ego-driven or just plain dumb and ignorant (yes that does indeed describe several from here ​). Btw, I thought Anusraggers recent comments were pretty accurate lol. I'm short on time...all for now

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Wolero7, Thanks for the charts. Looks promising. I have to research further on Semafore, but from what I understand by overlapping 30 Minutes, 5 Minutes and 1 Minutes, you have thrown multi time frame analysis into the mix. Is this correct? Have a nice Day.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hello Hepsibah, I looked at the charts with your inputs and wanted to run them by you to know if i understood them correctly. Correct me wherever you see fit. I am using Post-Zig Zag and StochMismatch v2 with settings of 18 periods for both. The Turqoise line represents (ZZ and Stoch being same on an up move). 1. The area marked in orange, the arrows did not immediately go in our favor. So now it becomes a point where price could revisit? 2. When do we take entry once we have identified a price level that has potential to be revisited. Is it at the start of the ZZ down move or at the red arrow. Please check the attached second screen shot from one of your posts. 3. Do we consider all the mismatches i.e. (Red/Blue) Arrows or the just the arrows that are similar to the Lime Green highlighted box? to have potential for the price to revisit. 4. The S/L is the recent high or low of ZZ? or do you keep trailing the S/L? Your advice of watching the charts on 1Minute Time Frame has been helpful as I am able to better understand by seeing the events unfold live. Thanks in advance..

--- 帖子 #306 ---
For the love of god man, you must have given a shock to quite a few members who might have construed that this post was geared towards them. To any one reading this, let me assure you that i am sure his post more or less was written keeping me in mind.I am leaning towards more... (Words such as plain dumb, ignorant was a dead give away...) While I appreciate your potential notion that your trading system is much simpler (which may or may not be true). Not trying to point fingers at you, but Albert has abundantly backed his worth by the number of people interacting with him. And as they say, the proof is in the pudding, Albert has a Trade Explorer to his credit. And the simple fact that many are really comfortable with Albert's approach. Stay awesome Land Line... Thanks

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Aavan, Let me try to step through your points. First of all, the blue line represents a new up move on the ZZ (not necessarily also on the stoch as sometimes you can get an up on the ZZ and not on the stoch). 1. Yes, the down arrow within your orange area would have been a valid entry for me (I believe it is also a valid entry for Albert's system as it is a down mismatch when the ZZ is still pointing up). This one failed in the short term and should be stopped out either at the next blue arrow or the next blue line indicating a new up ZZ leg. But I would mark the level as one with a high probability of being returned to. 2. the next short entry for me would be the next red down arrow and, instead of exiting at the next red line (next ZZ down), I would place my tp just above the marked level 3. this point is where Albert and I have slightly different approaches using the same mismatch info and both are equally valid. Albert likes to wait until there is a mismatch in a new direction to the existing ZZ leg (this is a new idea for me and one that I am liking - it obviously works from Albert's TE results). I have tended to look at every mismatch as a possible entry but I like to pick ones where I can see there is room to make a profit (please refer to my previous chart explanation for this rather than me repeating it here). 4. my SL is an arrow or a new ZZ leg in the opposite direction to my trade. My TP is the next ZZ leg in my trade direction (or a previous level that I have marked as described in point 1.) In this respect, I suspect Albert's method of trailing may produce better results. Keep watching the signals and ZZ lines on the 1m chart. It's not an ideal timeframe to trade as the movements are often not sufficient to make a profit because of the spread but, as you have already discovered, it is extremely helpful in getting a feel for how things unfold and you can try practising entries and exits on a demo account. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hepsibah, Thanks for the really quick reply. Will go through your inputs. It's much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
​It started so simple and effective. Wait for zz and stoch to disagree and then Trade. Now... It's just become a shitty indicator based entry.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Well the relationship that the Indi has with the ZZ is simple. Visually, whenever a ZZ leg appears we expect a Dot for the same period. It works like the Donchian. Now like the Stoch you will always see a mismatch to trade. The main calculations involved here are the Periods, H/L of the period that is used to create the channel and same for the ZZ. Traded alone, all you need to do is identify the mismatches between the ZZ/ the indi. I added the stoch for those watching the ZZ/Stoch. But like I said its better to stay with the ZZ/stoch for now. The end results will be the same Regards Al

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Watching G/U. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Albert Sir, Much appreciated for the explanation. I compared the Donchian channel with the Indi and they look very close with some subtle difference that I am unable to figure out. The calculation of the indi is essentially mimicking the ZZ, vis a vis the High and Low's of the period and therefore we expect them to behave the same way. I am taking your advice and will focus on the ZZ/Stochastic for now. I am rereading the thread and I am finding gems/things becoming clearer. Have a great day sir. Thanks

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Albert Sir, After rereading the thread, I see that you talk about : a. Trend Continuation b. Turning Points This is what I understand, Sir. Kindly correct me where you see fit. a. Trend Continuation: I used EURUSD pair and ZZ and Stoch (25,1,1) for both. Please check the below attachment. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The main trend(ZZ) is down, on stochastic reaching 100 we see that it did not generate a new ZZ Up Leg. At this point we are looking for a short trade. The confirmation is received via the PSAR and we enter at this point. The area (i.e. the box marked in white color) just prior to the PSAR confirmation may be considered as a pullback? And the price upon receiving confirmation via the PSAR has started moving down i.e. continuing in the original direction. Can this be considered as Trend Continuation? b. Turning Points: Sir, I reread the inputs and looked at the charts marked as Turning Points, but i am still in confusion with regarding to what constitutes as a Turning Point. If time permits, could you kindly shed some light about this concept? Have a nice day Sir. Thanks

Hello Hepsibah, Thanks so much for really going into the details and for laying out a great explanation. I apologize if I am testing your patience, I reread all your inputs from the beginning of this thread and there is one aspect you could really help me with. Permit me to quote you from different posts(I am cherry picking the points): 1. "Well done, this is an interesting take on a really good strategy. It's one of my favourites and one that I use quite a lot but as a way of identifying 'problem areas' that will be returned to at some point . I had not considered using it to trade in the opposite direction - but will definitely look into it!" 2."To try to explain, Eurusdd was all about finding price levels that would be revisited. In the 'how to use technical indicators properly' thread, he used mismatches between the stochastic and the zigzag." 3. "I was there at the beginning of the original thread which concentrated solely on the fact that a missing ZZ leg meant one would be painted at the price or better in the future." 4. "At each blue arrow, the stoch has printed a reading of 100 but the ZZ has not (yet) printed an extension of the up leg (or a new up leg if the previous leg was down) i.e. a point of dissimilarity exists. Eurusdd's claim was that the ZZ would, at some point in time, print a high at or beyond the point of dissimilarity. Vice versa for the red arrows." Chart related to Point 4 Attached: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Question 1: When you say Problem Area in Point 1. [" I use quite a lot but as a way of identifying 'problem areas' that will be returned to at some point ,"] do you mean: a. Blue Arrow in Up move ZZ and Red Arrow in Down move ZZ b.Blue Arrow in Down move ZZ and Red Arrow in Up move ZZ c. Any mismatch between ZZ and stoch irrespective of the direction of ZZ Question 2: My Confusion is regrading the difference(if any) between "Price Levels that would be returned" Vs " Missing ZZ leg means one would be painted at the price or better in the future". Do they mean one and the same? Kindly check the attached file. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The returning to the price level in the problem area makes sense, if initially the price goes against the problem area like in the picture. In a case where the price immediately goes in favor.Example: A blue arrow in an up move ZZ indicates stochastic as 100, but ZZ has not printed an extension of up move. Say, the trade goes in our favor, ZZ does extend upwards. Are we to consider the behavior as "The Price Returning" or " " Missing ZZ leg means one would be painted at the price or better in the future". The price returning to the level doesn't make much sense in a favorable trade as price did not go against it in the first place? Really appreciate you for laying out how you trade along with chart examples. On subsequent reading, i realized that Albert and you trade the same concept and yet differently, each one potent in it's own way... and you found a way to integrate Albert Sir's strategy seamlessly in your existing arsenal... I realize my above questions could be just terms used interchangeably, but i want to be sure... Have a nice Day.

You are right with the trend continuation......the elements you consider are: 1. The ZZ leg must be pointing down. 2. Stoch closes at 100 but no coresponding ZZ leg. 3.Enter sell with parabolic confirmation. I will get back to you with the turning point issue

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thank You Albert Sir for the quick response.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Albert, Every day, i could find dis similarity in ZZ &amp; STOCH, very simple &amp; promising system. Thanks again for sharing this. From the beginning i added Bollinger Band along with ZZ &amp; STOCH. How i am using Bollinger Band is: When ZZ is pointed down, if STOCH reach 100 &amp; there is no ZZ leg, i will look for bearish price action in top bollinger band. When ZZ is pointed up, if STOCH reach 0 &amp; there is no ZZ leg, i will look for bullish price action in bottom bollinger band. Could you please explain how you use/see Bollinger Band along with ZZ? Thanks in advance.

Turning point example

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Now this trade eventually failed, but I entered with Hepsibah's method.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I'm trying the first templates Albert with zigzag 25,1,1 and 18,1,1 stochastic. Using the sequence, for example 1 stocastoco to zero stochastic 2 100 3 stochastic back to zero and finally long until the appearance leg. And 'good on all TF. Thanks, a really good 3d! Sorry l '"English".

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Albert Sir, Thank you for the quick guidance. Sorry for not responding sooner. Please check the attached snapshot. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The second time Stochastic is at Zero, the ZZ could do either of the following: 1. ZZ could repaint immediately, moving further down. (OR) 2. Not repaint and yet maintaining the initial direction i.e. down. So, at this point do we just enter on the parabolic confirmation or do we wait for the generation of ZZ leg in the opposite direction as well? Thank You Sir and Have a great weekend.

http://i.imgur.com/LjL90Ba.png Non se puà essere valida questa impostazione: ho preso l'indicatore da eurusdd zigzag8 e l'ho fatto interagire con gli altri indicatori tutti a 30 sia ziag zag sia stocastico

--- 帖子 #324 ---
It may not be valid this approach: I took the marker from eurusdd zigzag8 and I did interact with other indicators all 30 both ZIAG zag is stochastic

--- 帖子 #326 ---
You are right. You enter on the parabolic confirmation.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Geros you are getting it wrong. pls read over again. Everything is clear in here. Regards.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Albert Sir, Thanks for the clarification. Have a blessed Sunday Sir.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Thank you, Albert. I have to read all 3d carefully.

http://i.imgur.com/xaiQh5x.png hepsibah, That's okay?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
http://i.imgur.com/evoyL5C.png Excuse my intrusion, but I am experiencing. I do not know if it might be a good idea to get up or down on the stochastic 50.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hello Geros......I missed some trades this morning and they would have been winners. What you are suggesting is trade-able but defeats the purpose of this thread or idea. We want to take trades with confidence. Now you know what happens with the stoch /ZZ about 90% of the time. You want to place a well informed bet.......then stay with the rules.... Ask any questions and I will try to help. Everybody trades stoch crossing the 50 line....but we want to concentrate on whats happening to price at 0/100. Are you sure you understand everything....?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
An example of what I missed.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Albert, strange my chart is different from yours. My settings are 30,1,1 same as yours.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Grazie Albert:But I still am trying to figure out a lot of confusion, both for the language and for the accuracy of the parameters

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Make sure your Stoch is set to close/close. ZZ/stoch are both 30 and the channel is 12......(12 because I want to see most of the trade-able dips in the ZZ direction. Al.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
yes, my stoch is at close/close and ZZ are both 30,1,1. Maybe a broker dissimilarity? No wonder why I cant find trade setup

--- 帖子 #338 ---
http://i.imgur.com/pxLW79T.png Is different

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hahaha......but today is quite slow especially that I am on the 30min TF.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Broker differences......

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Is your channel 12.....because it looks really tight

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Now should be fine: Stochastic 30,1,1 ZigZag 30,1,1 and Channel 12. Thanks Albert

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanks Albert Sir, I found the same anomaly. My screen shot for the same pair with same settings. Very Close to zero but not touching. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Good. But if I may ask, would you have taken the trade anyway?????

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Albert Sir, I would not take the trade due to the following reason: 1. You clearly specified 0/100, though rare the signals are very solid. 2. While we can try to allow some tolerance to accommodate the pricing due to data feed, this is a road i feel we shouldn't take. I mean where will it end, 95% stochastic, next will be 80% stochastic and so forth.... 3. Though it is a missed trade on this broker at this point of time, may be in the future it will generate a trade in our platform while at the same time there might not be a trade on other platform. The law of averages should catch, so consistency might be the key here. My opinion is that the beauty of you approach is you have amalgamated cut and dry rules into a discrete system. It is bringing the much needed discipline and clarity to my trading which i had been struggling. So, I don't want to second guess the rules. Kindly advise if i am on the right path. Thanks

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Stocastico 30,1,1 Zigazag 30,1,1. Chanel? 12 or 30? thank you

--- 帖子 #347 ---
How to know if a zigzag leg is confirmed ? sorry for the noob question

--- 帖子 #348 ---
You are absolutely right. Aaven. Thank you

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I am not sure I understand your question.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Thank You Albert Sir.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi Albert Sir , are these arrows rihgt entry setups ? thank you in advance cheers, Rees.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I don't know why but somztimes i get confused, may be i need to read all the thread over again. Thank you Albert for all the work you are doing here.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
http://i.imgur.com/0EpDaNe.png Albert'm not going to make another method. I ask only if the introduction of the two SuperTrend can help for revenue when it is broken down as well as up. Excuse me for no good.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Arrows 1 and 3 are valid.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Well that looks like a different system. You may use the super trend indi in place of the parabolic but the idea underlying the ZZ/stoch must remain intact.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
thanks for quick reply.cheers

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Albert I still have to figure out your system: you come when stochastics for example is zero and the parabolic rise marks, right? If there is no satellite signal when the stochastic is zero continues downward: I get it? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Al please can you correct this one and tell me whether the signal is good or not ..... We have a ZigZag but Sto did not touch the 0 Line. Is it a good Disimilarity to trade ? EDIT ..... About my settings, Gaussians SRPeriod= 30 Sto 30, 1, 1 ZigZag 30, 1, 1

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Ciao Winner180Zigzag 100 Stochastic also should go to 100 now so long then sell. I think but Albert

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks for bringing this observation up Wiinner. In the picture below you will see I have circled our first entry opportunity. Typical turning point example. The yellow circle that you have is directly opposite the white circles..........In both however we have dissimilarity, this hints us to trade in the opposite direction of the price.......They are mainly turning points. The signal is good....But be guided by the parabolic ( good S/R) in this case. I bet you did not trade the white circle.....Low confidence maybe.. For you to win in this you must take all signals and stop guessing. Trust me, we all don't know where price will go next. Demo trade and gain confidnce.....

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Geros, the dissimilarity in the yellow circle is not common. The white one is common and more reliable, but both dissimilarities give winning probabilities.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I am not guessing Sir, i am still learning. Thank you for your feedback, need to keep reading your remarks so that i can quickly spot the good entries. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Al, about turning point, am i right about the red rectangles as a turning points? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I don't intend confusing anybody by this picture........Aaven, your answer is absolutely right....... We will discuss this when everyone is comfortable with ZZ/stoch.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Lets see how it plays out. Entry is with parabolic confirmation.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
No Mario.......what you have highlighted are just the repainting ZZ leaving its mark and it should correspond/similar to the Stoch. Turning point opportunities show when there is no similarity, like the white circles....

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi Albertdkpllh. Thanks for you share your system. It's very nice. May I know how to set profit stop?

Continuation setup

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Dear Albert and all contributors; Dear Albert and all contributors; I read the first page a few time , i still do'nt get it , could you explain when to take a position In a simple and easy English ,so non native English speaker can understand it as well. Thank you a 1000 time, and God bless you all. Guys thank you so much for teaking the time for my request .!! and guiding me ..!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Same as this........

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I have noticed that this type of disimilarity when traded, i should close the trade quickly as the price can go and re-test that level. I did not take the short but those who are short should be carefull as the price can go back UP UP UP But it is only probabilities .... Let's see where it will go.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi .... So what is your native language, mine is french ... So may be i can try mine .....

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Thanks for reply, but mine is Persian.! In easy langauge i will untherstand it and i am sure there are many peaple like me , and yours or others explanation will be helpfull. Thank you

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Thanks Albert. On the surface it all looks easy, but it is not! There are difficult underlying concepts and if you do not understand you copy and basta! I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing. The method by zigzag 25 and 18 stochastic remains in force? Because you have more considered valid stoc and zigzag with the same settings?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks a Lot Albert Sir.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hello Geros, It's Ok. Albert Sir presented couple of different ways to trade using the same principle. To understand, we have to practice and practice and put number of hours demoing. This will be helpful: Do Not Use Zig Zag 25 and 18 Stoch. Use Zig Zag =30 and Stochastic=30. Thanks

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hello Geros, If i am not wrong, you used Super Trend in some of your images. By doing that, you are not trading Albert Sir's system and it will create confusion. My advice is please demo using original rules. Do not add or remove anything. Thanks

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thanks Aaven I do like you to try to understand reasoning and observing. With zig zag 25 and 18 stochastic concept seemed easier to understand, but if you preferred zigzag 30 and stochastic 30 I will try to understand this new way. The setting! MTH B700 + OS ... is 30?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Certainly Heaven. I will try to figure out the original rules! I read everything even what you have written, it seems to me that you have understood everything. Sometimes I do not even understand because of English

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hello Geros, No problem. Do not use MTH B700+OS for now (Use it later after some experience and confusion is cleared) Use this: Go to Page 1 and Post Number 8. There is a template. Use that only. Don't add or remove anything to it. Use these settings: 1. ZZ=30 and Stoch=30 Time Frame: Your choice. You can use any time frame like 30 Minutes, 1 Hour etc... If you small time frames like 5 minutes it will give more number of entries and so more experience... It will clear confusion faster... Thanks

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hello Geros, It's not like that. Even I am demoing, and I also reread the thread many times. You will understand it. No problem. Just give it some time. Thanks

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Was to late to take trade in Al method, but still was a chance do it in other way, gained 39 pips .. ZZ=STO= 25 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hello Heaven I see only now. Thanks indication. If I understand: I keep an eye on the stochastic and zig zag and I set with parabolic for revenue

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Stochastics is easy to see when you get to 100 or zero, but the zigzag do not know when will the leg: the zigzag dovebbe appear after 30 candles when it reaches 100 or zero, but sometimes one leg is made of less than 30 candles and sometimes many more. Sorry perhaps the banality of the question, but for me it is a problem when quantifying appears delloZZ leg

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Albertkpllh, I have a question. Since the isolated dots that do not relate to the zz are considered to be dissimilarities should we mark those as potential places where price will return like in the similarity thread?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi Sir Albert. What do you think of this type of Disimilarity ? I think it often act as a turning point. I took a Buy EChf. Let's see. Thank You.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Now this is a very interesting situation. I had to close these trades.......I hope you can all see why now. I expect them to go down now with parabolic confirmation. Stochs are at 100 now but no ZZ leg up......and of course you wont find a ZZ leg because price could not go Higher than the ZZ leg within the last 30 candles.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi can you post it with an example of a picture. Kindly add the settings too Thanks.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Perfect setup.....and your SL should be at least 18pips. You may win 90% or loose but am happy for you. You took the trade. Congratulations.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Waiting for parabolic confirmations.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Settings are 30 for zigzag, channel and stoch's. I am also using the HA candle method. Okay what if hypothetically price shoots up from the last green ha candle in the blue box. Since it's dissimilarity should I mark that area for price to return.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Mmmm....unfortunately I am not experienced with that method of trading. You mean trading towards that zone in future.....

--- 帖子 #393 ---
But I will encourage you to use the parabolic instead of the HA, its more reliable

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Thank You

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi everybody. Just spotted another one on M15. Let's go Long Eur Usd and see .... Happy trades to Everybody .....

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Oh Ok thanks. Does anybody have a parabolic indicator that shows the price value

--- 帖子 #397 ---
It went straight to my stop loss. I think i know which kind of disimilarity i should hang on .....

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Albert Sir, Thanks. It makes sense. I have attached a snapshot of my understanding. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sir, How can we put the turning points information to best use? I mean, like in the attached snap shot, do we use it as part of our exit i.e. exiting the long trade. (or) Also as part of initiating fresh trades, in the above example closing the Long CADJPY and as well as initiating a new sell? Thanks

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I took this oene but the target point was a little bit wide, i should now close it a the breakeven, but it went down almost 20 pips, we have a big chance that the price will come back to the disimilarity level.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi Sir, What type of parabolic do you use ??? Is it not giving signal too early ???

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yes Aaven, I took a long that consolidatd heavily, I guess I was not so lucky with that. But in the consolidation presented an opposite opportunity(sell). So I have to close the buy and see how it plays out for the sell

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Standard parabolic settings. I think its just fine

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hello Winner180, That snapshot is from Albert Sir's system. As for the Parabolic, I am using the standard Parabolic provided by MT4 with default settings. Albert Sir is also using the same. I am currently demoing with original setup and settings. So, i am not looking at Heikin Ashi or others for confirmation and just using parabolic. So i can't exactly tell if it's giving early signal or not. But Albert Sir said in one of his posts that parabolic is much stable. Hope it helps. Thanks

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Another one but i saw it late. Happy Pips ......

--- 帖子 #405 ---
A question: I try to interpret the idea that lies at the base of your operations. For example, when the stochastic is at 100, but do not you think that even then ZZ ZZ will come to 100. To enter expects parabolic sar. It's right?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
http://i.imgur.com/szohUnv.png

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Slow down Winner, I am not comfortable with this type of dissimilarity.......Lets concentrate on the regular ones.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Now I am comfortable to have the ZZ leg appearing and pointing down.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I just try to understand. The shot, which I marked in the chart are dissimilarat points ranging all revisited? It is part of the method? http://i.imgur.com/9qsYVrp.png

--- 帖子 #410 ---
No Geros they are not dissimilar they are similar to the stoch below. you will notice that stoch is either at 0 or 100 at those marked zones.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hello Albert I meant that those points are dissimilar from Zigzag Zigzag and then is likely to revisit those points

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I got 40 pips with this.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I go to the sea, are on vacation, you later. Thank you all for the signs http://i.imgur.com/Hlvtk0H.png

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Albert Sir, Thanks for the explanation and charts. As a rule of thumb, in addition to not only fine tuning your exit using turning points, you also take a opposite trade, like in the above case provided a parabolic sell appears? Thanks

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yessssss. Don't worry, I just wanted to show what i spotted, anyway with this type of disimilarity we should be careful and quickly close as it can turn back very quickly. Anyway i will continue to watch them and give a feedback.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Good morning everybody. Almost nine Am here. Just want to wish you all a successful trading day.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thank you mate. Same to you

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Winner hello good morning to all. I am still in demo. I'm trying to figure out precisely the level of appearance of zizzag leg

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Just follow the sto. When sto touches 0 level or 100 level either a new leg is supposed to apper or zigzag will repaint if we were already having a leg in that direction. On the picture below, the yellow circle shows you that STO is 0 or 100, so you have zigzag, but the white drawing, shows you that you have STO was first there, so we got zigzag, but later on STO come back and tested those levels, with the price making new levels, so zigzag repaints Attached Image (click to enlarge) So we are watching in order to exploits disimilarities points. That means we have STO touching 0 or 100 and Zigzag not drawing. I hope you will getit through my explanations .... Anyway let me know

--- 帖子 #420 ---
For now the explorer dont look so profitable, i hope they will in the future.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Don't worry about the explorer, as for me everything is well. Things are looking up

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hello Metta87, It's just part of the game. Just focus on the principles and you will understand the effectiveness... Have a nice day mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yes Aaven, Staying focus is the second key for success concerning me. The first one being PERSEVERANCE .....

--- 帖子 #425 ---
For some reasons I am beginning to accept that we should concentrate on a few markets......max 3. Nice day all.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I whole heartedly agree Winner...

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Here is one, Some should wait Psar to confirm, but i took it on a price action i recognized. Here we go ......

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello Winner, The color scheme, dots is throwing me off.Just to be sure. Is it a continuation or turning point trade? Can you explain the reasoning behind the trade. Thanks

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Thank you Albert Sir. I agree, focusing on few markets is little less stressful, but if there are any specific reasons please do share the reason why you feel that way when time permits.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi Sir, Correct me if i am wrong, The STO touched the 100 level and we don't have any zigzag at that candle, so the price can reverse. So i took a sell on a price action, but i now decided to close my trades quickly .... Today i got a lot of good entries, they went toward the target point but later on returned to the stop loss, so from now on i have decided to monitor my trades and close with small profits ....

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Thanks winner for the explanation. So your trade is turning point. So instead of Parabolic, you went for some kind of reversal pattern. Have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #432 ---

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Both turning and continuation, but continuation more.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hello Aaven I think if I understand continuation trend: when he still has not appeared the leg and the stochastic is cone in this case 100 and then continue going down to zero. If they are of these configurations. And 'an Albert configuration if I understand http://i.imgur.com/hQFIgWj.png

--- 帖子 #446 ---
He http://i.imgur.com/kv0hETl.png Here I can not understand the logic of this entry buy nor the target. It is not a criticism, but I would like to understand why. Thank you

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Thanks Albert Sir. Have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hello Geros, In my opinion, there is NO buy trade as the stochastic did not touch 100.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
In fact for me it was not a valid entry: I took that as a graphic example, but it's not my chart. I thought the Albert deemed a valid entry, and I wanted to understand why. But maybe I did confusion and perhaps even Albert considers a valid entry. Goodmorning everyone!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
If I'm right here you are not continually sell well because the appearance of the leg should be downwards: more and better work in the direction of closing of the leg http://i.imgur.com/CTzY4R0.png

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Goodmorning everyone. Sorry if it does not fall in the method. Watching the live charts is very difficult for me to understand the method. Looking at the past, it seems easy, but in real it is not. This morning I'm taking advantage of the real inequalities between stochastic and ZZ: When the dots appear, and Gaussian falls open sell stop profit 10 pips stop loss I place it at the level of 20 of the stochastic. It seems valid to be verified http://i.imgur.com/xfCbZW9.png

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Albert Sir, For one of my queries regarding trading your approach during news events, you shared the above inputs. Permit me to quote you: "1. Turning points: Price will not go beyond those levels whether News event occur or not. 2. Trend continuations. " When time permits could you throw some light on turning points about the fact that price will not go beyond a certain level irrespective of the news... Thanks a lot Sir.

This seems to me a good entry: When the stochastic has reached 100 then the price goes from the contrary, expect a favorable moment for you to stochastic and ZZ will return to 100. What do you think: certainly nothing new for you, but for me it is a discovery to make more pips. I take this opportunity to thank all participants in this 3D first of Albert http://i.imgur.com/N5Xa89X.png

Morning Albert Sir, Geros, Sorry friend. I am unable to understand. If it's alright, could you explain again please. If you want just focus on the explanation of entry i.e. in the example above: Why did you take long? Thanks

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hello Aaven I took long because if you go to see historians when the previous zigzag has not reached the stochastic and retraces the side opposite to us, just waiting for an entry with parabolicsar and 99% zigzag back to 100 http://i.imgur.com/65kNfQI.png

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thanks Geros for the explanation. Have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thanks to you Aaven. Good day to all!

I hope thats really the case mate...

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Yesssssss That is really the case. What you are seeing on the explorer is a " 10$ No deposit account ". none error wa allowed beccause of the leverage, but i did some. That does not mean that others accounts are not growing ...... So as for me THINGS ARE LOOKIN UP ..... Thanks and happy trade.

AUDUSD Trade stands cancelled. The ZZ leg extended before the parabolic confirmation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But even after leg extension, it is showing potential turning point trade, as stoch made another 0 without new leg extension. So waiting again for parabolic confirmation.

Goodmorning:The price is expected to fall for the speech of the similarities between stochastic and zz: for me from here is sell http://i.imgur.com/TikcQw0.png In fact the more just entered the chart I posted would be upward, but I want to check if after some tribulations the price falls back to the red arrow A good entry downside would have been to wait for a signal from the satellite dish

Thank you Aaven. Same to you. Regards Al

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Albert Sir, Hope is everything is well at your end. Upon re-reading the thread, I had a doubt. I am copying it from that post. "For one of my queries regarding trading your approach during news events, you shared the below inputs. Permit me to quote you: "1. Turning points: Price will not go beyond those levels whether News event occur or not. 2. Trend continuations. " Albert Sir, could you throw some light on turning points about the fact that price will not go beyond a certain level irrespective of the news? Will be much obliged if could answer this answer for me. Have a really wonderful weekend Sir Thanks

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi Aaven, I wish I was an expect in those theories ( if price will get to certain levels etc), However what I believe is that the market is not random. The news and other factors that get the markets going do so only to satisfy certain levels. The turning points I discussed is one way of telling where those levels are (with good probability) The news will come but the setups point to the directions to trade.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thanks a lot Albert Sir for the explanation. You are a gift that keep's on giving (I mean in a good way). I am much grateful for the hand holding and the continued support.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Meanwhile, Happy 2017 to everyone. I see that the 3D has stopped: shame because it looked really good to me. I also at this time I did other things. Hopefully the 3D rise again! From about a week I'm doing demos with the approach of Albert and hepsibah: in particular the use of hepsibah approach: work especially on 1m, 5m and 15m if for example the minute she appeared a yellow or light blue vertical line (zero 100 or stochastic) would be a signal to close the trade, but if the five minutes or 15 m vertical line has not appeared I can decide to extend the trade.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Good morning. Trading can be simple, but difficult. Patience and greed, not easy to manage. Patience, I think is easier to manage. Greed on the other hand though bad, but good. How do you manage the good and bad of greed.........something to think about

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I believe we fully understand the concept of similarity between the ZZ and the Stock. When the Zigzag is at the top we expect the stockastic to be at the same position. Will post some pictures with explanations soon...... Nice day

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Looking Forward with Enthusiasm Albert Sir...

--- 帖子 #501 ---
This picture shows similarity (blue square areas) and dissimilarity (orange circle areas). We know this by now. ZZ value 100 and Stoch 100.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Now the blue box are areas of interest. Here we find the last leg of the ZZ downward and as expected Stoch is hitting zero once again. My interest is the clues for me to start buying. For this I add a more volatile stoch of 12 as seen in the picture. In the area ZZ and Stoch are bearish, anytime a new ZZ leg appears i expect both stoch 100 and 12 to be at zero and in agreement, similarity is achieved.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Everything is similar until the Stoch 12 is at zero and the other stoch is not there. Most of these occurrences mark the end of the ZZ leg downward. Obviously your stoploss goes to the ZZ leg plus spread.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Another example. As I come across relevant examples i will post.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Albert Sir, Thank you Very Much for the new inputs. It is much appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Got in slightly late but you see the picture.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Albert Sir, Any Specific reason for the faster stochastic to be 12? Thanks

--- 帖子 #508 ---
No. You could use a bigger stoch value which will give you more conservative hints.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Albert, Again we see things 'Similarly' and yet 'Dissimilarly' (if you'll forgive the pun ). This is what I look for - seems to work on all tf's Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #510 ---
there we go

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I like the 'Similarly' and yet 'Dissimilarly'. In fact your setup is the best, requires a lot of patience because most of the time they are similar. The higher time frames require even more patiences. I see the stoch values 240 and 24....woooow 240 stoch on 1hr TF may take a very long time to setup. What is the ZZ value. Cheers....

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Very interesting.........How is it that we are similar and yet dissimilar...... . But you will see my setup for that buy in the picture Please Hep how would you have traded this.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
My inclination is always to view dissimilarity zones as prices to revisit at some point so if I see them I'll mark them and, when there seems to be a move towards them, use them as a target. I don't do much manual trading these days but your recent posts made me have a look and this setup seemed to be sitting up and begging. When I used to trade this way, I was often guilty of anticipating the return too early and so had to endure DD before it finally returned. If I started to trade it seriously again, I'd use additional pointers to get me in at higher probability entries (like SD levels). In fact I'd probably wait until you spotted an entry LOL. I use the long and short stoch settings because I use similar settings in an EA (not exactly the same settings) that has proved profitable though it doesn't use dissimilarity. However, I wouldn't use these on htf's - takes far too long to return to diss zones. You have stirred my interest again so I may have to take another look

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Al, i dont find the blue box (price and stoch) being similar. Am i missing something?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
They are similar. we tried to establish a relationship between price (ZZ) and the stoch. Anytime that a new ZZ leg was formed upwards, stoch must be at 100. However we noticed the dissimilarity when stoch was at 100 and price did not go higher ( no new ZZ leg was formed). this was shown by the circled areas. Let me know if its not clear.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I've been playing around to try to determine whether or not there is a difference when the stoch is at an extreme (100/zero) and the zigzag isn't (no new HH/LL) to when the zigzag is at an extreme and the stoch isn't. To try to make the results and the chart clearer, I've used pure HH and LL's rather than the zigzag indicator since they do not repaint. They show however where the zigzag would have made new end points. I've used 60 as the lookback period for both the stoch and the HH/LL's but there's no significance in my choosing that. You can make your own deductions as to whether they could be significant or not.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Interesting indi. Shows the mismatches clearly. Thanks for sharing. Is there an indi that shows the small pale blue and salmon daimonds

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Here it is, just a simple HH/LL indicator. The most interesting thing that has come out of this so far for me is that a Major H/L will always be on either a 'naked' H/L or on a DissHLnoStoch, never on a DissStochnoHL. Probably obvious but how this is used is another brain teaser as it would be dangerous to assume every DissStochnoHL is going to lead quickly to a new HH/LL, especially if it comes just after a recent HH/LL.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi Al What does that mean?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hepsibah, Kindly let me know if i understood this correctly. We mark the area where stoch=240 made a high/low and no new zz. We take the entry on the Stoch=24 to the area as target. In the above example; we enter on the black box where stoch-24 is zero with the grey area as the target? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi Hepsibah, Happy new year to you all. Simply amazing!!! I had my mind so closed on my approach that I could not understand what you were driving at. I am so excited about all your contributions. Okay. Now the 3 bigger black arrows you have there are not fails because eventually you still the ZZ leg developing beyond them which if traded could be profitable having spread in mind. I see just one fail and that has been circled in orange. its a fail because no new ZZ leg developed after them and those are what my approach seeks to exploit. So putting what you wrote in perspective: About 94% of the time when stoch was at 100/0 and there was no new ZZ leg after the candle had closed we should expect a new ZZ leg to be created which is tradeable. However in the event where it fails you can fall on my approach. My approach will be occuring about 5% of the time, they are rare.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Nope. The grey area is a failed area that you can trade with my approach but Hepsibah MARKS it with a line because almost surely price will return to that level as seen in the ensueing picture

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Fantastic. Agreed

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi Albert, happy new year! I guess the million dollar question is when can it be considered to have failed. If we can come up with a rule/rules for that then we have a situation where, in the case of a mismatch we can play both sides if we: - assume it will continue in the same direction until a new match is realised - close for a loss after the rule/s kick in and enter in the opposite direction Or maybe the answer would be to only enter in the case of a failure to avoid there being insufficient room to make a profit in the case of continuations - this would likely be a factor of the timeframe used. I pretty much spend all my time now coding and testing EAs so, if we can come up with some rules, I can easily put that into an EA and test it. I have accurate tick data going back to 2003. I suppose the simplest rule I can think of at the moment is to use number of bars as a rule e.g. if a new matched leg has not appeared within x bars of a mismatch, assume that it is a failure and enter in the opposite direction with a SL at a new match in the old direction. I'll make a start on that one but ideas and contributions from all are welcome.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Thank you Albert Sir. Always a pleasure to hear from you...

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Happy new year to you too Hepsibah. Theoretically its easier to trade the stoch mismatches the way you explained, practically its safer to trade the presumed failed mismatches.....and even with these you could hedge it, use my approach only or yours, where you allow price to move away from it and you trade it back up. I think we need to decide with rules, the specific approach to use else greed will cloud our judgement and we will make unpardonable mistakes. Thanks for making your resources available. I dont sleep over this. I am sure something will come up soon. Meanwhile lets agree on how to find the failed mismatches.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hepsibah, My Idea: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I know this will be the most noob question out there but I believe there are no stupid question for noobs if we want learn beyond the beginner level. So here goes me making a fool of me-self, does Stoch actually repaint at those settings? I know that Stoch does not repaint itself but the first post states something about it repainting when the setting is X,1,1.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
What if we let the price come to us instead of weathering the draw down which could be steep? What are your thoughts on using pending order... We have the high probability price level which is the target price. We use the swing high or low as the reference point for the pending order and stop loss... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks

--- 帖子 #531 ---
The Stoch does not repaint after the candle closes.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
You will have to determine where to put your pending orders since price could keep moving away for days.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Ok, here's a starter. This indicator should show where there was a mismatch (i.e. stoch=100 or 0 but no corresponding HH/LL) x bars previously and no intervening HH/LL. So we will consider this to be a fail and therefore a potential Albert entry. I am using HH and LL rather than the zigzag indicator because it is easier to see the history of where they occurred as they do not repaint. The settings for the indicator are the lookback period and the number of bars before the continuation pattern will be considered to have failed so you can play about with these settings on different timeframes. Here's an example to try to make it clearer. Happy experimenting

--- 帖子 #534 ---
The donchian does the same job as the HH/LL so, if after you have played with the new indicator and think that there are relevant SLs/TPs based on subsequent HHs/LLs that could be something to build into an EA for testing.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I am actually a big fan of pending orders but you need to have a clear idea of what you are expecting price to do when it gets there and how long you want to keep them 'live' (as Albert stated). So it's worth a lot of study time to see what price usually does when it returns to a previously mismatched stoch/HH/LL. Do you expect it to bounce or continue for example?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Thanks Hepsibah, I see what you have done. I set it up on the charts and its exactly what I hoped. Perfect. Already I see a lot of winners but I am most happy because it shows me where the SL should be. again just an observation, all of my failed entries (SL that are hit ) indicate trend continuation and good areas to enter the trade. Experimenting Time

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Analysing the chart below, we have three sell entries. Sell 1 went 22 pips plus spread unfortunately a lot of us frown on 20 or 10 pips so lets consider this a failure. SL is set at 54pips. If you had a pending buy on the SL it would have gone 62pips before stalling. Sell 2 went down 80pips and a SL of 50......winner Sell 3 went 400pips and an initial SL of 120pips.. The emphasis is how to manage the failed entries..... Still exerimenting....

https://i.imgur.com/y3vYYOJ.png I instead of the stop loss, when I see that the trend is changing through the numbers, I put an order against a draw. If I entered the sell area, when the trend is back in the sell area, I remove the order for protection

Stumbled on what turned out to be a very interesting thread, this. Skimmed through couple of first and last pages...(a little too deep for me but I aim to catch-up technically...) But one thing for sure: you both Albert and Hepsiblah gotta get married to each other fast and I don't care what genders y'all are! Truly a team you two... poetry in motion

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hi Guys, After reading the entire thread today, it does seem like the original theory of the ZZ &amp; Sto were the simplest method, and at the time there were claims of 90% win rate or about that. If that win rate was so good, was there really any reason to continue hunting for extra indicators and methods or confirmations? Just interested to hear your though on weather you think the new additions have made the system better or worse, easier or harder to trade with. As always methods and threads change over time, but sometimes the earlier ways turn out to remain the simplest and the best...

--- 帖子 #549 ---
This is an orca system. A killer whale! I only took the Stoch as a refference from it, as already trading the ZZ. But the stoch proposed settings and the correlation with the ZZ settings is simply priceless information! Always having a problem where to exit. This tread gave me 50% more travels! Combined with my range edge levels? Holy Shit! Still not perfect, but a big relief... Fantastic!

--- 帖子 #550 ---
That sounds promising! So are you using correlation with the ZZ &amp; Sto, or are you using the dissimilarity between them? Any chance of a quick chart pic? Cheers!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
When this idea was first put forward in 2013 it was the most exciting idea for me that I had come across and I spent at least two years of very long days trying to make it work for me. Simply put, it said that if the stoch made a new HH/LL but price didn't then there was a very high probability (around 90%) that price would continue in that direction and make a new HH/LL. So, as you say and as most of us who were there at the time thought, here we have the next best thing to the HG. The difficulty in actually making it profitable is that majority of the time, the dissimilarity (mismatch) is corrected on the next bar or very quickly afterwards and so the room for profit is very small and actually unworkable on small timeframes. And then you have the problem (which is more the meat of this thread) of deciding at what point it has moved too far away and must be deemed a failure. Because you need an awful lot of those 90% tiny profits to make up for a big failure. I no longer trade this way and have EAs to do my trading for me now but I still love the elegance of the idea and can't quite resist the thought that maybe there is a way to make it profitable

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I am not using any SLs and everything I say makes no sense to the readers here. Why? I never accept a loser. I merge. Flip instead. Average everything. Continue. Never surrender. Drawdown is the price for that kind of behaviour, but with Al's stoch, there is a high probability i will wipe it out. This MF DD, I hate so much! Now, fast flips in the killer range, as a second approach appear to be the solution I am searching over the last two years. The automatic trading cannot wipe out the DD. At least I could not figure it out with the complete automation could handle the no-DD trading... I cant share charts on that topic mate. I am sorry. I am an asshole... I am fully aware of that fact...

--- 帖子 #553 ---
https://i.imgur.com/cLoGtlz.png Long live the new union between the two great myths of this 3d that made me glimpse possibilities unknown to me so far. I do not know if this can be a contribution but I try: when stochastic and zig zag (better if the first time) are both 100 you go long; when stochastic and zig zag are both at zero we go sell because most probably RIDIPINGE. Furthermore, when the stochastic and zigzag are both zero or 100, we most likely have a middle bar.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Geros, Does the stoch=100 and zig zag need to occur at the same? Thanks

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Yes, same.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Geros, I meant to ask, Does the stoch=100 and zig zag need to occur at the same TIME/Occur on the Same Bar? Thanks

--- 帖子 #557 ---
It is at the same time: both must be 100 or zero. At the moment with this technique I work on TF5m but it's fine on all TFs.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
So to be clear, your are waiting for both to align on the same candle, and then trade it as a retracement/pullback?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thanks Geros...

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Sorry, the concept is simple but it is my English that makes everything difficult. It must be expected that both (stochastic and zig zag) on the same candle are for example zero (here comes the concept of repaint and the concept of middle bars because when the zig zag and the stochastic are both zero even the candle can be the lower for example the last 10 candles: H10)

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Yes unfortunately what you are saying is not clear, other than it is not certain what will happen...

Good day to you all. Just want to share a rare occurrence or anomaly that frequently surfaces to hint a change in trend or turning point. It always presents as a double top/bottom with the ZZ. At its occurrence there is always a clear misalignment between the ZZ and Stoch.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Ciao j1mm è lo stesso!Here in Italy it is more than 4 at night. Last thing then I throw: I noticed now that the method of darts with the two moving averages ema21 and ema8 could be somehow solved. If you look at the chart I posted earlier that was 100/11 and 18/11 darts if you take into account only darts you notice that almost always goes in gain. The only times you do not go into gain is when there is a pullbeck on the 21st. When the price goes down again after the pullbeck we could put a stop loss on the darts and a reverse considering Albert.
