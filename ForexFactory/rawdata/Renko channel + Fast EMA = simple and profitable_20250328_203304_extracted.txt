There are just 2 indicators, but looks how powerfull! I just using this 2 indicators Fast3MA and Renkostreet_channel http://s11.postimg.org/wxbhw53lv/Przechwytywanie.png post images Price channel repaint but it doesnt matter. It based on price action high and low, and if H/L got break its just reapint. For renko chart this is powerfull stuff. We need bounce of channel and react for fast EMA. Its would be nice if somebody, for example MathTrader7 who is very smart programmed would make EA for it. Simple rules = React price for high low of channel = bounce and close below of EMA for sell or above ema for BUY We can filtr for better entry in 200 EMA direction. STOP LOSS in last high or low of channel, we exit, when candle close above or below EMA in opposite direction. Holy Grall? Edit. I upload also mql version of channel - here not dot but arrow, but its same. Mql code just for programmers Edit2: Here more clearly rules http://s1.postimg.org/hf1t0ksr3/Przechwytywanie.png pic host 1. Wait for bounce from channel 2. Candle reversal close below EMA for Sell, candle reversal above ema for buy 3. We exit only when candle close above or below EMA. Like in example in 3post Candle need close!

--- 帖子 #2 ---
what time frame do you trade this system on

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Its renko no timefrate based on 10 pips box size. look how many pips to get what RR... SL just above/below H/L and take pips before EMA out

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Fast3MA indicator on my chart looks different than yours, any idea?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hey Math its just this one option take off and will be same

--- 帖子 #6 ---
In 200 EMA direction filtr i think we should have more money in long time period trading automaticly it. Main Trend is always your friend, but i see reversal signals are also good, but more risker.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
So simple and intersting strategy! How long have you been using this strategy?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Okay, looks promising to my eyes running it on the MT4 strategy tester. I'll give it a try to automate.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I hope you can make EA

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Cool, i love you bro! Could you test 5 examples of trading? Entry rule are always same (bounce of channel and candle close crossed EMA, but lets check this examples: 1. Exit when candle out of EMA like in default rules 2. Exit when one candle change direction 3. Exit when 2 candle change direction 4. Take all signals 5. Take only signals in 200 EMA directions Lets check whats settings gonna give the most of money! Waiting for results bro, regards. Edit: There is idea also about plot 2 EMA in default settings. When they cross take trade, its something like 1 candle more smoothed

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks for your strategy, it looks pretty good. I really want to test it, but my problem is, that i have no Renko Chart. Is it possible that you upload the indicator/ EA you create the Renko Charts with? Best regards

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Here is one, I've been using it with no problems.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I found these renko - more profitable and the good thing don't need any indicators -- can be traded bare Naked }}}

--- 帖子 #15 ---
post the expert please? and what settings are you using for it?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Looks profitable. I will try it

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Zamanib, where is the indi? let me try. thanks,

--- 帖子 #18 ---
a beer for your excellent joke :o)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Kiads shifted renko charts can't be traded naked.....

--- 帖子 #20 ---
i have heard that renko chart repaints. The thing goes like this : You have a chart with, let say, 5000 bars First bar starts at 00:00 01.01.2015 (just an example) As long as you do not restart terminal, the number of bars rises, that first bars does not change and renko is effectively anchored. But if you restart the terminal, it again loads last 5000 bars, starting time (and value) changes, and your renko changes. So by keeping it run all the time, you are effectively anchoring renko and preventing it from repainting (without having a code that does that). If you restart terminal, anchor is lost, and the repainting happens

--- 帖子 #21 ---
what u say is absolutely right. fortunately there is a renko indicator (or expert?) made by KIADS, wich has this build in anchor, so u get the same offlinechart after terminal restart... search for Kiads, u will find it! green pips, robcole

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Gotta be careful with renkos. They can backtest really well, but the results can be misleading. For example, news spikes can show up on a chart looking like a really profitable and obvious trade, one of those "big wins" that push a system into "profitable" territory but in reality such trades are inaccessible. I managed to fool myself like this in the past. Not saying it can't work, just a heads up.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
This is exactly right. When you backtest a Renko-based system, it's all too easy mistakenly to imagine that the "trades" recorded/measured/calculated are trades which you'd have been able to take, yourself. In reality, this is often not the case. The difference between "the trades the backtest takes" and "the trades you can take yourself" can easily make the difference between overall profit and overall loss. Just something to be aware of. And yet another reason (as if one were needed) for forward-testing on demo, or for tiny stakes , being far more reliable than backtesting, and for NinjaTrader being far more useful for research/testing than MetaTrader!).

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi there robcole.. Tried searching for Kiads and it shows as 'membership revoked' against his profile and couldn't locate the particular EA! If you have it, can you pls post the same here ? Cheers ! Darshana

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Here u go:

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Cheers bud !

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Installed it. Appreciate if you can let me know what I need to do in the input window to ensure the ranko chart is 'anchored' and does not repaint whenever the terminal is restarted. Also can you pls let me know what 'Boxshift percent' does for a Rank chart. Pls pardon my ignorance as I'm relatively new to Ranko and finding my way around the indicator trying to understand how it works. Cheers !! D

--- 帖子 #28 ---
please post your template here

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hello, if you want to do some visual backtesting, then you can replace the Renko street channel with Donchinan bands indicator. The setting with period 15 (or so) should be close enough. They are almost the same in the real time testing.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
can we have a template ,please? :]

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I've never used renko bricks but this looks like fun. I installed the channel and fastMA's OK. Where can I get the nice looking Renko bricks I see in these sample charts? I looked all over for an mq4 file for the indicator, but couldn't find it. And THANKS.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
What are you speaking about -- I trade it daily with net 20-50 pips daily This is special renko - Does not repaint - and does not do any of the balony you mention above

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Can you pls share the indicator / EA for this type of Ranko ? Cheers ! D

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Can you make alert when price bounce from channel? Thank you so much!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hey, thanks for the RenkoStreet_channel Indi - i like it! Good luck with your thread.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Is that chart you show on the first post from live trading? if is from backtest than is a different story. i think it better to combine it with normal chart.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
It is always good to see new posts for renko systems, but take into account that this indicator is repainter. I had used that indicator in the past, but wasn't sure and wanted to search it again. That doesn't mean that couldn't work for you, just mention that issue to be aware of that if you don't know that. Re: Super Signals Indicator Originally posted by nbtrading View Post All super signals versions are repainting. Some are claiming that they are trading it successfully, but so far I haven't seen proofs for that nbtrading You are right : there is no super signal indicator that does not recalculate PS: super signals is equal to fractals with adjustable periods. If someone has a strategy that is using fractals then super signals can replace fractals (answer from mladen from another forum)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hello Zamani, How do you enter and exit?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Where can I get this Renko chart?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
can anyone make a alert when price bounces? :]

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Just finding this thread. Looks interesting... Zamanib, would you mind sharing the Renko you use and it's settings with us? Or anyone who knows? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Guys I bought it . I am not hear to sell or promote any thing-- But I do love to trade renko and indicator free . I am get interested in any renko trading system. Just learning how other traders trade renko

--- 帖子 #43 ---
haha nice to know that.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Ah! Okay. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Skyler, which indicator is that in the bottom of your charts? (one with green and red columns) Cheers.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
you need a alert when the 'bounce' happens or you will be sitting at a computer al day ! :[

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The Renko indicator on this Forex Factory thread looks very similar to Zamanib's: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=466450

--- 帖子 #48 ---
You right, lets wait for MathTrader7 who gonna try make automate it. Its would be very helpfull Sorry guys for no answer, coz im very busy this week.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks oordjb

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Witaj/Hi, I got some EA write direct on my plan. It is based on Renko charts with implement some indi like Renko Chanell, Renko Strenght and few other. My charts looks Attached Image I trade this system over 6 months. I hunt only 5-10 pips on trade. Box size is 5-10 pips. Depends on pair. Not much but for me to test is ok. Also this system have bed days. but with in long term can work with stabil profit. MM is most important. Skylre odezwij się ziomie do mnie.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Skyler, which indicator is that in the bottom of your charts? (one with green and red columns) Cheers.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi, this interesting. I like renko concept and the chart looks easy to spot on support rest. this work on any pair or eu only?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Maybe you haven't read my post attentively.i have said *without having a code that does that.most of the renko chart repaints.but you can trade with it.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Here is Version 1.0 of the EA. Please check it and come back to me with your comment. Note 1: The EA needs the attached indicator to work properly. Note 2: The EA only works on non-gap Renko charts . @skyler: Please check the entry logic of the EA.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Great work I try it

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thank you I will try it this week

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks bro! I gonna check it. Do i need uncheck offine chart while EA trading?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yes, it is necessary to uncheck "Offline chart" option on the Renko chart. More details here .

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Do you have any idea how to save our charts? I mean when we uncheck offine chart, after re open MT4 we have H1 timefrate instead m2. I have idea for it that: uncheck while open, but before to close check offine all for dont lose TF. Is there any script for it? How your advice ?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Can anyone tell me, where is Renko offline chart?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I use VPS. The manually check/uncheck offline chart option that you mentioned also works.According to MQL4 reference document it is not possible to check/uncheck it in MQL4 language.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Its seems to EA open trade immediately when bounce channel. I think would be better results if open after candle renko close - its comfirm market change direction. By the way EA working good, i see nice results screen down.. but i think in long term its would be better to comfirm bounce of channel when candle close in reversal direction. Also would be good with trailing stop function

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hello all... thanks for sharing the system A very interesting strategy indeed, I have found 2 indicator versions of renko but need alert added. Could any of you kindly help me in this regard? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...64#post8580864 Thankks.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I agree with Skyler. I would also be great if a take profit at the opposite signal were an option as well. As you can see, I moved my orders to profit. So far so good...

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Skyler/ShomariG, Can you kindly share the renko that you use in the chart ? Mine showing 'Please attach EA on a Non-gap Renko chart!' and not opening any orders. Thanking you in advance. Note : It's okay, I found it here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=8211651

--- 帖子 #66 ---
MTayyab - open a chart, put it to the timeframe you want to use (I use 1minute for Renko). Then add the Renko indicator to it (I use the MathTrader7 Renko). On the Renko indicator you should be able to put in the brick size (should be in tenths of pips so 100 would be 10 pips) and the timeframe (use a timeframe that isn't common - I use 2min). Then you can add the offline chart by going to File - Open Offline. When it comes up, scroll down to the same pair you added Renko to and the same timeframe (2min). Then click on it and it will open a new chart with the Renko on it. You can add any template you want to it. John

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Just to let you know you can find him at Penguin Traders ,,,,

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Here is Version 1.10 of the EA. In this version the EA additionally checks the price to be closed over/under a fast MA (8,Linear Weighted,Close) and the last closed Renko bar to be Bullish/Bearish in order to open a Buy/Sell position. A trailing stop function is also added. Note 1: The EA only works on non-gap Renko charts .​

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hello. I'm sorry you have to select 'Chart Offline' in the graph Renko?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Nice! Thanks MathTrader! I would also like to suggest a shift percentage setting so we can test different Renko types for more control.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
See post #58.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hello Zamanib, so could you share just the settings you are using ? Boxsize and ShiftPercent ?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
[quote = ShomariG; 8581739]. {quote} Vedere post # 58 [/ quote] Sorry. Thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
going to TP.. look how its powerfull, just statistics, we have great RR to have money in long term. I think about higher TP and trailing stop whats you think guys? Ok lets check another version of MathTrader7 EA. Great work bro!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hey could you share your spread indicator? I have similar, but show points, no pips. Pips looks for me better

--- 帖子 #76 ---
does in work with mini lots or microlots?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Is it really only touch is not good?this way we can get better entry and stop loss keep smaller or the same-.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
what Super signal channel/Renko street channel settings are you using?my chart's indicator is different than you.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
http://forexwinners.ru/forex/renko-street-system-v-2-0/ Someone else already made it in april 2015.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
You right, but price can make very long run and break another and another high or low, like in EURJPY example. First version of MathTrader7 EA I got 4 bad entries coz price still doesnt react for channel. I think better to wait for react - reversal candle or cross fast MA to show us this high is more respected. Its meybe give worse entry, but save us for a lot of loss trade. We enter then in logic - just after react from bounce channel

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Skyler, you don't read others request. Anyway, thanks for sharing. Because of this thread, I'm trading Renko charts of profitable approach, in a very different strategy. God bless.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Sorry i was very busy and looking at topic fleetingly, didnt see your question. You can share your style game here, we are here to help each other and improve concepts

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Skyler, you appear to be using "Range Bars" and not "Renko Bars". Please clarify.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
how can that not matter lol

--- 帖子 #85 ---
HI, which size of the boxes are you using?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Becouse we waiting for react price and bounce..... if last high got break, its making new high and last repaint... reading comprehension does not hurt

--- 帖子 #87 ---
looks like someone used to sell it

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Skyler, reading comprehension does help, indeed. Let me repeat -- you are trading RangeBars and not RenkoBars. Or, more accurately, the pics you are posting are RangeBar pics and not RenkoBar pics. There is a big difference.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I used renko 10 pips

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi MathTrader, can you make the same ea but with a normal chart, not using renko? thanks

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Sure! I got it from here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...21#post4945321

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi fellows, if we want to take a trade and hold it till the opposite signal, it is a good idea to secure the position with partial close. A possible solution could be: SL=30 pips at 10 pips profit close 70% of the position (we are at break even now) when opposite signal appear close current position and open new in the opposite direction. Attached is the try I made today on EURUSD: SL=10 pips at 7 pips profit close 70% of the position TP=20 pips I am not a coder, but this idea could be of use. With best regards udeltaforex

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I monitored EURUSD today to find a good entry point, but the upper StreetChannel line moved the same way up like the candles. Do i have to wait for the next down candle?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
He is using non-gap Renko chart ea provided by mathTrader7. (see post 54&amp;68)

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Skyler, thank you to show us the validity of the EA and thanks to MAth for having succesfully delivered. Can you share the settings for the EA with us?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I using default settings, its look very good

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Skyler , EA has been running since morning ,no errors in experts folder and no trades for EURUSD .Is it correct in common TAB offline chart?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Math, I guess this is a basic one: "Do I have to change the magic number for each chart I run?"

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I would say yes. Or else every chart with the same Magic Number will initiate a trade. At least that's the way it works when using a Dashboard.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
hey guys...interesting stuff did a little work over the weekend and came up with possible ways to confirm entry on trend and counter trend trades check the pics below... RSI is set to 3 with 85/15 being overbought/oversold areas i know my chart looks very different but i'm experimenting with various indicators to see if anything will help...added murray math lines, pivots, trend intensity, range flow along with pbf squeeze, pbf scalper show me, renko street trend and nihilist ultra trend may be overkill but if it's easy enough to remove some that don't help haven't tried the no gap bars chart yet which is why i also included the wick-o-gram indy to view the bar wicks hope this helps...peace edit: sorry...first pic should say yellow vertical lines...uploaded correct pic for second sample...used the wrong one...sorry

--- 帖子 #101 ---
No, you don't have to :-)

--- 帖子 #102 ---
thanks for sharing this system : ) I have only begun using this system two days ago, I live tested it in conjunction with the rainbow MMAs serving us exit/entry points for my 7-20 pip scalps, and seems to work nice together so far. 41 lovely fearlessly gained pips yesterday alone. : ) link to the rainbow MMAs should others want to observe- http://urbanforex.com/forum/topics/u...lping-strategy . Good luck everyone.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I have saw the renko channel repainting big time. Does it react better on renko charting? I have started the EA yesterday night, I'll report my results by end of day.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
It doesn't matter much in renko chart.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks to this thread, i got my profitable trade, not 100% tough. Could anyone please add alert sound &amp; pop up notification for this Indicator ? Because i have to see my metatrader if the signal is come out or not from this indicator. If you can share the mq4 file after modification for alert &amp; notification, so we can learn from your code. If not, its okay just the ex4 file with the default settings from the indicator. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
this is the same indicator. just set the dist1 and dist2 to 24. as it is the default from the indicator you posted.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thank you, it works great.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Thanks, MathTrader7, for your EA! Could you add some Moneymanagement for autolotsize?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
can you please make an ea with super-signal-channel? thank you =)

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hey Im having a problem. May I know the steps of using the EA? It does not seem to be working in mine. Im using micro account

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi kaoscoded, could you upload your RSI color indicator? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #112 ---
sure

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I'll add money management in the next version.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
let's see some charts. Long here:

--- 帖子 #115 ---
update

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Here you go -- Key is to catch the micro trend -- 5 x 4 pips = 20 easy in each session London &amp; NY -- I know few traders do it day in day out

--- 帖子 #117 ---
EA didnt open EURJPY opportunity :/ But opened EURUSD and gain pips it was similar opportunity, but i dont know why didnt open EURJPY whats you saw @dragos

--- 帖子 #118 ---
would you mind sharing the settings you are using ? I´m not asking for the indicator. just the settings of your renko indicator. boxsize, shift etc...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hey @MathTrader7 i have idea how to improve it in very simple way and without any unnecessary indicators. Its possible to make EA without TP, only SL and trailing stop (but also dont need i think) based only on Heiken Ashi and renko street channel? I think we also dont need Stop Loss, coz we enter for example in bounce green heiken ashi up and if after is red and close it will close our position immediately. Its will be always lose around 10 pips max 20 pips and can avoid false reversal EA would open not with fast MA ( this was good, but i think sometimes we could get better entry) only based on bounce from channel and change heiken ashi direction? Heiken ashi looks powerfull coz its filter false reversal much more than fast MA and its working faster. Sometimes we have 1 candle faster signal and we can gain +10 pips at start But logic on EA could base only on heiken ashi? I mean without TP - lets market to decide about our money. If heiken ashi change colour and close candle EA automaticly close our position. When heiken ashi change colour after bounce of channel EA automaticly open position. We dont have any human factor about TP, coz sometimes market gonna give for us a lot of pips and advance determination of TP is wrong. But i dont know if it possible to make EA about heiken ashi - close when change market direction look at examples Inserted Video like in this song They sing to keep the trend as long as possible and cut off quickly loss i love it

--- 帖子 #120 ---
How can you set what you don't have

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I wouldn´t ask if I didn´t have it.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I Hope This indicator Not Repaint , Because this indicator have a Twice Signal and then not change the Place for First Signal

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I opened it manually, because I was in front of the computer and noticed it. MathTrader could you please check why the EA didn't open the EurJpy trade, but opened the EurUsd trade as mentioned by Skyler?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
The same problem here... The EA only open orders in CHFJPY and EURJPY pairs, I applied the same settings for the EA in all pairs. Also I noticed that it opens orders in middle of no-where, where there's any bounce in the channel, and re-enter when the price come back below the MA (for sell) and above the MA (for buy). Also, I saw it opening 2 orders at same time , same pair (this time in a channel bounce, so it's fine), but one of them closed in the hypothetical channel bottom range, and the paralel order close 20 pips lower, both of them in profit but it doesn't have to open 2 orders just it did. The testing account is micro, by the way. Thank you MathTrader7 for the EA.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The ea took a trade in EJ, but without all conditions met (according to the system). Seems to take it when price below lma.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
The EA uses the default settings of the indicator attached to Post 54 . The channel indicator settings that you use on your chart may be different. Please check this and let me know.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
1. Just set Take Profit to zero in the input settings of the EA v1.1. 2. In the next version I change the enter logic of the EA based on HA Smoothed and the Channel.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Please provide a screenshot of the missed trade, I'll try to figure out why it happened.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I'm not getting any trades on EU. In fact in the journal I am getting the message Memory Handler cannot allocate 4194304 bytes of memory. Also Not Enough Memory (65275 bars). Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I am seeing a similar issue. EA and the Streets indicator are loaded with defaults. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #131 ---
only from the picture i would say his bricksize is about 3 and shift about 5% http://prntscr.com/91k1xc http://prntscr.com/91k45e

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Would be nice also to give option choose. For example: For scalpers: 1. EA open trade when change direction and closed bounce from channel - close trade when next candle is again change direction. (based only on candles meybe would be nice for scallpers with less tha 10 pips brick) For intraday: 2. EA open trade when change heiken ashi colour after bounce of channel - close trade when next candle is change colour of heiken ashi (based only on heiken ashi) I think based on heiken ashi smoothed its so delay. I think standard heiken ashi candles would be better, coz we enter more early and leave quicker.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Great EA! Finially I have found something useful. It will be great to automate the stop los to 30 pips. Ex: It opens LONG position and the stop loss is set to 80 pips, after goes 30 pips in profit should start the stop loss to move, to protect the win. I hope you understand me. And open an donation somewhere, willing to donate.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
skyler Could you please consider the possibility to include a partial close in the EA? Attached is a picture with manual trades for the last 3 days: - default setting, brick size=10 pips It looks good.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
And so it begins. Again.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
It is the screenshot from post #114. Skyler mentioned it as well. Quoting skyler EA didnt open EURJPY opportunity :/ But opened EURUSD and gain pips it was similar opportunity, but i dont know why didnt open EURJPY whats you saw @dragos I see subsequent posts from nelson_tr, max_pips, jagzuk whom seem to have encounter similar problems. Where is smoke there should be fire also Thanks

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I haven't tried this system yet but I can't see how it can work with the channel that repaints so much. Perhaps with Donchian channels it would be better? max

--- 帖子 #138 ---
It does not repaint. It's also not a channel.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Says who -- It does repaint

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi, It seem that the channel indicator is repaint.. I attach the version where the channel doesn't repaint here. Hope you guys can back test and think some idea to improve the system. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Here is Version 1.15 of the EA that additionally uses Fast3MAs indicator to enter trades. Note: This EA only works on non-gap Renko charts . You can download the required Renko builder EA from here .

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thank you very much! Any suggested config?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Says Forex Smurf.

Hello Everyone, Can anyone help me plz...I have placed the ea on renko offline m2 chart and its been more then 48 hours but its not opening the trade. Smiley face is there on right corner. Everything seems to be good but its not opening trade...i have removed offline chart tick from chart properties common tab... plz guide me.... thanks

--- 帖子 #145 ---
you wouldn't by chance be running build 890 or later?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
HI MathTrader7, would you like to add an exit rule by opposite candle formed.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I dont get any trades either .I am running build 902.Why is this matter?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
see post 54, in order to run ea in offline charts (at least mathtrader7's offline ones) you need to uncheck offline chart in properties. (read his instructions)

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi, Math trader 7 Would you like to set an exit rule in settings like you previous EA's? Hope it will be better. Like below image.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
forex_dimi, shg said he "removed offline chart tick" the problem is the later builds of MT4 don't work with Mathtraders REnko EA properly - it's a little touch and go; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't

It does repaint. However, the author made that perfectly clear in the first post - "Price channel repaint but it doesnt matter. It based on price action high and low, and if H/L got break its just reapint. For renko chart this is powerfull stuff. We need bounce of channel and react for fast EMA." Best, Josh

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thanks for that

--- 帖子 #153 ---
thanks a million!

--- 帖子 #154 ---
ops, sorry , had open trade that time thus anxius, and didn't read the post properly.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Which setting to use? fast MA (8,Linear Weighted,Close) or from screenshot ( default in EA )?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Yes, I read that too. Still doesn't repaint. You can see where the indicator has adjusted itself to the new high/low, based on the last 24 bars.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
5 trades 5 fails. Not a good version. http://s15.postimg.org/rcgto61x7/image.png Maybe yo9u have missed something. Check the screenshot, normally in such candle goes SELL trade not call.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Well yes, you can separate blatant repaint from readjust, or re-position, but still isn't the effect the same in terms of a trade signal? Best, Josh

--- 帖子 #159 ---
If you consider the high/low of the last 24 bars as a reversal signal, yes.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Use it on Renko charts. There is no guarantee that this strategy is profitable. Test it on demo accounts first.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
The MA settings is for trend filter not fast moving average. The EA uses the default settings of Fast3MAs indicator.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
This is a Renko EA. Dont use it on a normal Chart bro

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Can you please tell me how to use it? In what chart? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
You must download the nongap Renkochart from Mathtrader7 (Post#68.) Take it in the Expert Folder. Close the Metatrader and start it again. Now open a M1 Chart and take the Nongap Renko Chart from your Expert Folder in your Chart. Now you open the Offline Chart(M2) . Load the Template... Tadaaa

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thank you Sir. The problem is now it wont create every 2 min new chart. It stays in the same chart since 8 min. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes. Renkocharts base only on moves. Not on time. In Renko you see only the Pricemove.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Ok thank you! Now where should I activate the Renko EA? In the 2 min chart or in the orginal m1 chart? Should I exit the M1 chart or not? Hey thank you for your help, I hope I can get some money back,

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Take the EA in the M2 Chart. The M1 Chart you dont close. Minimize it.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thank you! I hope this will work.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi MathTrader7, great EA so far. Let it run through the London session and into the US session and has made about 100 pips profit, although I see some mistakes. In eurjpy, the EA took a sell... that was proper, next the EA should of taken a buy... instead it took another sell which got stopped out as you can see in the picture I attached. I also noticed it is doing this trading gold, trades the complete opposite direction then it should. Other then that, I see nothing wrong. Worked great and profitable, I'm letting it run till close of the week to see how it holds up.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi fxent, There must be a bug in the EA that it opened a sell position there. I'll try to figure out why it happened, and I will release a new version. Do not trade live till we thoroughly test it!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
of course! all demo right now, I also noticed it missed some trades as well on some pairs. I'm testing it on about 13 pairs at a time, trying to push it.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
You're feedback could help me to detect bugs. Please keep posting the results and your observations. Thabks for your effort.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello Mathtrader7, I am currently demoing this strategy on renko and so far I am really liking it, but if I may ask, is there a way to have an alert for the fastema, if possible please. -Thanks

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I had set up with 15 pairs with previous ver for yesterday, 2W 7L., some trades were begun at the close of 2nd candle. Updated to ver1.15 12 hours ago, no trades are triggered.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Both indicators repaint

--- 帖子 #177 ---
For myself in EJ took the short and afterwards the long possition as it should do. I have seen however that when I close manually a trade the ea opens a 2nd trade no matter the distance from the ma or the channel.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I think about delete fast EMA code. When we got bounce of channel and got reaction with 1 candle opposite direction close, its always cross this pbf_3EMA. Meybe lets run only on candle? Bounce and reversal direction candle cloed. Then take trade. The most important think its when leave from market? Meybe lets do +1 option? We will save a lot of opportunity, when market change direction in not our way. For example in screen. We have sometimes bounce reversal and +1 candle in our direction and market change again direction in opportunity way. If we take +1 option in EA its will always save and dont loss money. I upload code of EA what give +1 option, didnt test it, but check this code MathTrader, meybe could you add this function to EA.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hello , I would like to enter an alert when the price hit the top or the bottom of the channel ?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
So your saying if the second candle closes in opposite direction back across the ema, place a trade in that direction and close the losing trade?

--- 帖子 #181 ---

So, zamanib - what is the name of the shifted renko indicator you are using and where is available to buy it? Intrepidpips asked this and I am also curious, because as I understand from you this indicator does not fail since you are using it.. You act like you have a secret indicator, ignore questions about it, but yet proactively try to stop others developing their own. It doesn't look good..

thanks a lot eurix and ShomariG, for your very constructive response edit: unfortunately ShomariG's doesn't work on my mt4 platform build 902. - subsequent edit: actually first time I tried to load it as indicator and did not work. Second time tried to do it as EA and worked, but market was closed at that time. So let's see next week.. also regarding eurix's: ! MTH b700+ Accel Shift Flip Renko Builder Indi.ex4 -it is indicator not EA, right? my pairs have suffix -Pro. e.g. "EURJPY-PRO" and I don't manage to load the offline chart at all. Allthough I checked the StrangeSymbolName to True, put StrangeSymbolSize to 4 (-PRO), filled Pair 1 as "EURJPY-PRO". It says to load the offline chart EurJpy-Pro, M11 but it does not create it..at least I don't see it in the offline charts list.. Regarding your comments, I fully agree with you - one should be able to trade simply with candlesticks first, to understand S/Rs, trendlines, supply &amp; demand etc. Which I do. Furthermore, this shifted renko looks intriguing I hope the thread OP does not mind me raising these discussions on shifted Renko. If yes, will restrict them. wish you a nice weekend, Dragos

results from approx. Wednesdays Asian session to Friday close of markets risking about 1.25% of account per trade based off a $20,000 demo, this was version 1.15 before bugs were fixed for reopen of trades. There was some losses because of the reopens and wrong direction opens of trade, as well as the first 2 gold trades opened from setting up the EA, other losses were from sl being hit at 25 pips. Some trades were closed from myself during US session because there was another bounce off channel in the opposite direction which the current trade would not have been closed yet, and therefore the EA would not have opened another position in the opposite position... A close of position on touch of channel might fix that. GOLD does not work properly for this EA, it seems to have its times where it will work, then it will open positions the wrong way as well as when it crosses back over the 3EMA it will take a new position without the channel. The EA missed a lot of trades on other pairs, not sure the reason for that. The system works amazing if manually traded, and once the EA is clear of bugs and issues this could be very powerful. Great work so far MathTrader! Next week I will be running this from open to close of the week completely untouched based on a $10,000 demo account, risking 2.5% per trade. I will also be running it on another account semi automated with myself monitoring/opening and closing trades depending if I see any EA errors within the trades.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
It's nice results. Thanks for your testing.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hey MathTrader, I see this issue of coming up again and again with EAs on offline charts. I realise you cannot change the Offline Chart status from code, but perhaps the EA could check it and display a message if the chart is in Offline Mode. Might help reduce these basic questions (and it would certainly help me when I occasionally forget to uncheck a chart). What do you think? http://docs.mql4.com/constants/chart...art_is_offline

The indi is base on HH or LL. so if PA exceed prev HH or LL it will give another signal. it does not repaint after candle closed.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
maybe I'm wrong but seems like if the bounce is not significant the signal repaints. In the following chart I have attached the "Renko_channel" and "Super-signal.channel1" (non repainting version). Signals of the non repainting version are in magenta.

Now it worked with gold . Although the wrong direction , but still. The candles are not resistant . Gold Renko , silver and oil is again overturned in normal candles. I had MT4 meantime not closed .

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi jtrujillo, for the repaint part, i think not to different, but the indi will create more signal and need filter. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course this will be different in renko chart. above is standard chart. How to deal if we have 2 arrow appear, if no filter, EA will just enter on signal generated. if down arrow, sell. if up arrow buy. same with renko street, but it will remove old point. and also watch when we have narrow channel. It will make it larger and create new signal. so history chart will be have a different result with trade if use EA only without filter. I do just enter when signal generated from renkostreet.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
So far is ok, if you put starting time and stop in the new version will be great.

Mathtrader I have a question which you hopefully have an answer for. I loaded the ES onto a GBPJPY chart. I am under the impression that a trade will be opened once a bar closes below the EMA for a short or vice versa. In this example the short should have been opened as shown by the green arrow. I have included in the screenshot the settings of the EA. Maybe for clarity could you please explain the entry conditions. Many thanks. E

You have EA? Very interesting strategy

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Here is Version 1.50 of the EA. In this version the following updates have been applied: 1. The user can enable/disable MA trend filter (default is enabled). 2. The user can specify max spread to filter abnormal market condition (default is set to 35 points). 3. You do not have to uncheck 'Offline chart' option! The EA works even if you don't uncheck it with some programming tricks I implemented into this new version Note 1: This EA only works on non-gap Renko charts. You can download the required Renko builder EA from here . Note 2: This version is not fully tested. It may represent some bugs. Please report your observations. How to install this EA on your MetaTrader4 Platform For newbies, here is a video on youtube that shows how to install any EA on MetaTrader 4 platform in 5 easy steps

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Did you guys remove the 300 sma filter? Or is it still set at 300? I haven't had any problems with it using the set settings.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Could you add price bounce to touch the line and enter the trade , important support ressistance to calculate day,4 hours, 1 hours in external where we can sellect to use the time frame after each big moves or side way market to get the real Breakout from ema and important support ressistance Thanks

--- 帖子 #317 ---
i think the best filter is using support and resistance.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #318 ---
It still does not work for me The last one which works is 1.20. By the way, my broker has -PRO extension (e.g. EurJpy-Pro). Maybe you changed something about this, and this is the reason?

Hi MathTrader Im experiencing same sort of issue, I've followed all you valuable instructions, tried different brokers, different mt builds, different ea versions, but no trading at all.

yes, today i seen total 4 order opened. and all are profit. but today i try to attach renko chart EA with roboforex mt4 but EA shows massage pls attach this ea with non gap renko chart. i also attached non gap offline chart which created by renko chart create bouilder ea. i download from your link.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Probably your new MT4 has no enough M1 history data of the symbols you are attaching the EA to. You need to load more M1 history data.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi Mathtrader, I have some problems on my Renko charts. I currently have the following charts open: EUR/USD, EUR/AUD, EUR/JPY, GBP/USD, GBP/AUD and GBP/JPY. On some charts the Renko bars do not update. On a 1min chart I have the MathTrader7_RenkoChart Creator EA. On the offline chart I have the latest ver 1.50 of the Renko Streets EA installed as per attachment. I experience this problem on some of the other charts aswell. Can you please help.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Please check the build version of your MT4 platform, and let me know.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
MathTrader, to solve the problem, I perform the following steps: A) Close the off line chart B) remove the Renko Chart Creator EA from the 1min chart. C) Delete the M200 (offline chart) history D) Reload the Renko Chart Creator EA on the 1 min chart E) open the offline chart and load the necessary indicators. I tried closing the offline chart and then opening it again, but that did not load the latest missing data. Regards

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Mathtrader the build is : version 4.00 build 902 Please note that the Renko Street EA v1.50 does not open trades as well. If you want I can send you some screen shots

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I got Mt4 ver: 910 and also not work.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi MathTrader, as per previous thread, attached a screenshot of a missed EURJPY trade. Please correct me if I am wrong. From the thread it is mentioned that initially the entry would by a close above the EMA for a long and the position would then closed if price closes below the EMA and entry then in the opposite direction. Hence the inclusion of the trend filter. But I am assuming now entries without a trend filter. Then a couple of threads later Skyler suggested that the entries be based upon the colour of the Heikin Ashi candles. So could you please state what the entry and exit conditions are if no trend filter is used. Does the EA then open and close trades based on price action around the EMA? Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Why do you use M200? Repeat the procedure with M2. And please check your MT4 build version.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
The EA is compiled and tested with build 890 successfully. I also had a problem with build 902 and also build 910. If you can, downgrade your MT4 to build 890. You can do this by copy/paste terminal.exe of build 890 into the folder of your MT4 build 902/910.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Post 331: I use the M200 offline chart as I have a constant range bar chart opened with the M2. For test purposes I will close all my M2 constant range bar charts and allocate the M2 to the Renko charts.. Post 332: Where do I find the Build 890. Sorry for being ignorant. But my MT4 platform updates automatically whenever I open the platform in the mornings. If I look under Program Files/FXDD Malta/, I see a terminal application folder. But this reflects the latest build, in my case Build 902. I do not have the earlier build. Maybe I have missed something.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Mathtrader, Ok I changed my offline charts now and all the M2 charts are designated to Renko charts and in future I will designate my Constant Range Bar charts to M299 and higher. I will monitor this now and advise on future developments. Thanks again for the help.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Oh! Mine is 902. It is not work!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
thanks. I followed your steps and resolved the issue as well

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Impressive chart...., now we have to determine entry and exits.

Could you please indicate where the terminal.exe of build 890 can be downloaded from? I looked for it and did not find it. Thank you

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Attached is the terminal of MT4 build 890. Note: You need both parts to extract the whole terminal.exe.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi MathTrader thanks for the files. I installed them on the FXDD platform and checked that all my M2 offline charts are working. So now I will let the platform do its work and will give feedback tomorrow .

--- 帖子 #342 ---
thank you very much. you are very kind

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thank you Mathtrader7

--- 帖子 #344 ---
hello i got so difficulty to open these rar files.anybody has any idea how to open these files. thanks fred

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I tried to replace the terminal.exe that you provided, but it stays at 902.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi JB, Extract the .rar file. You must extract both. When you extract the second file just click on skip when there are duplicate files. Copy the terminal.exe file. Open your C drive and look for the MT4 platform in your Program Files folder and paste it. If prompted for replace or skip select replace. Close everything and open MT4. Most probably MT4 will close and another screen will come up. In my instance the heading is "User Account" Do you want to let program make changes Click no. If you click yes then the latest version of MT4 will be installed. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Here is Version 1.60 of the EA. This version is compiled with MT4 build 910 , and it only works for those having MT4 build 910+. I removed MA Trend filter, and I added another filter with some optimization that I get the following results. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note 1: This EA only works on non-gap Renko charts. You can download the required Renko builder EA from here . Note 2: This version is not fully tested. It may represent some bugs. Please report your observations.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi Mathtrader, Need your help please. I am running now on Build890. However some charts have problems with updating data. I have included a chart for the EUR/JPY. I then closed the platform and opened it again to check if I am still on Build 890. I then discovered that the cM2 chart is not updating even though in the top left corner the current price is shown. So Chart 1 is before and Chart2 after. Chart3 shows the time difference between the 2 charts. The EURAUD stopped at 12/08. Likewise all the other M2 charts - EURJPY, GBPUSD, GBPAUD, GBPJPY, GBPCGF, GBPNZD do not have the latest info on the charts. Last night I after I installed Build 890 I created all new M2 charts. I left the computer running and discovered that the MathTrader7_RenkoStreet EA v1.5 did not open some positions. I then went back to my 1min chart and discovered that the MathTrader7_RenkoChart Creator EA was not there anymore. So for some reason when the platform was closed and reopened the EA was deleted from the chart. I will open another MT4 platform from another broker with the latest build and see what happens next. Will keep you posted.

[quote=MathTrader7;8597750]Here is Version 1.60 of the EA. This version is compiled with MT4 build 910, and it only works for those having MT4 build 910+. MathTrader my broker is still running on Build 902. That means I must wait till they have brought out Build 910??

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi eckbertg, This observation is really strange! I suspect about your broker Please open a demo account with IC Markets (which I'm testing all my EAs on) to see whether the same things happen to you. Best, ​Math I do not have access to MT4 build 902 yet. If I find this version, I'll re-compile the last version with build 902... What is your broker?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hallo, Eckberg, can you please share indicator VB 9.11.5? TY

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Mathtrader I am back on Build 902. On my 1min chart I have installed the Chartcreator EA with the matching M2 chart. I have opened and closed the platform a number of times and I have not lost the Chartcreator on the 1 min chart and the M2 chart keeps updating. So it seems that there must have been a conflict when downgrading to Build 890. Also I have installed the RenkoStreet EA v1.2. I will run a parallel M2 chart which I will call M3 and install the Renko Street EA v1.6

--- 帖子 #353 ---

--- 帖子 #359 ---
[quote=MathTrader7;8597909] I don't get any error. It does not attach to the chart. So if I drag v1.61 onto the chart it does not open the input screen. In the meantime I have installed a demo version from IC Markets. The version that I have is the build 910. I have made 4 1min charts. 2 for EURUSD and 2 for EURAUD. I want to create a M2 and M3 chart where I want to load the version 1.5 and 1.6 and try them out. The EA is on the chart as you can see, but there are no M2 &amp;M3 offline charts. On FXDD I do not have this problem. Can youn please advise.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
... Ignored Hi, I just had the same problem but was due to the 5 figure values. That is to create a 10 pip bar or brick the pips figure used is actually 100 instead of 10. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
0. Check the journal tab of your terminal for any error. 1. It takes a little time for the chart builder to create Renko chart (offline M2 chart). 2. If you want to test v1.5 and v1.61 at the same time, do not forget to set different Magic Numbers for the EAs. 3. I have no problem with IC Markets MT4 platform. I just guess that you need to load enough M1 history data on newly downloaded IC Markets platform.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
The brick size is in points, not pips! So, in order to create 10 pips Renko charts, if your broker is 5 digits, you must enter 100 as Renko brick size, if your broker is 4 digits, you must enter 10 as Renko brick size.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hi, my brick size is 100 piplets and time fame M2.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi Math you will eventually come back to MT4-version 9.10?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
MathTrader7, what broker would you suggest for this particular EA? I have FxPro but I am considering RoboForex for the fix spread

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I use IC Markets, but it doesn't mean that this EA won't work properly with other brokers. In general, true ECN brokers with good liquidity, fast order execution, and without re-quote error, platform freeze and so on would be recommended.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
hi mathtrader, is it possible for me to test this on strategytester on mt4?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Yes, but you need to create non-gap renko history data and save it into a M1 HST file....

--- 帖子 #369 ---
thank MT for the response, i tried it but error, so thats the secret..

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Interesting, thank you. At the moment I am running the EA on demo account to test it at 1:100 leverage. Are you on same leverage figure?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Wow math nice i see updated EA. I had bad results with EA what i tested on VPS what i mention. What filtr did you add? This ea work also with offine chart?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
[quote=comoestas;8598368]Why to use only renko ? traders need to add a personal touch to what we read here. here is my touch Hi Comoestas, I suppose that there is nothing wrong with your suggestion. However if I may answer on Skyler's behalf, that this is a Renko + Fast EMA thread. We are all contributing to improve entry and exit levels. MathTrader is nice to give us an EA to do the job automatically. I have a suggestion and that you have an interesting topic to start another thread. I would be more than willing to subscribe and follow

Here is Version 1.64 of the EA. This version is compiled with MT4 build 910 , and it only works for those having MT4 build 910+. This is the same as 1.60 except for a minor change where I observed that included stdlib is not compatible with some of platforms, so I removed the dependency to this lib in this version. Note: This version is not fully tested. The EA is under test and development. Use it on demo accounts until a stable version is released.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Notice! I just realized that there are some updates made in MT4 build 902+ which prevent it from letting EAs get information about offline charts unless the user manually unchecks "Offline chart" option! So, if you are using EAs 1.60+ on MT4 build 902+, you have to uncheck "Offline chart" option in order to let the EA work properly.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi, thanks for Your work. I have newer used Renko but i will try. Can I close the 1 min chart after opened the 2 min offline chart? Regards Elovv

--- 帖子 #380 ---
If you close M1 chart, Renko M2 chart won't be updated any more, and consequently Renko Street EA won't work.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Do you still trade it manually?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thanks....do I have to open a 1 min chart for every 2 min offline charts? I guess so... And can You explain settings for money management? Now I have everything default as on Your backtest. Thanks again and greetings from Sweden. Elovv

Once it stops scrolling back then add ea to create offline chart and you will see enough candles in your renko offline chart.... i hope this helps you... best regards

Generally there are 2 things to do 1.) Put those files in their corresponding folders 2.) Insert EAs and Indicator in the chart. There are 3 needed files to run MathTrader7 Strategy 1.) Renko Chart Creator (To Create Renko Chart) 2.) Renko Street EA (To open position automatically) 3.) Renko Street Channel (To draw the red and green line) The first 2 are EAs. The third one is an indicator. I put 1st and 2nd in Experts Folder and the 3rd in Indicators folder. Have you put those files in their corresponding folders?

Just curious, does it matter whether you open the renko chart through the M1 or not? M1 never worked for me, I've just been loading the charts up through the H4 only way I could get the renkos to show. If I use the M1 it only shows 1 bar in the past candles.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
It takes lot of memory. My mt4 chart hangs, than i have to close and open again. How to solve this? Anyone has better idea

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Mathtrader, I opened a demo account with IC Markets build 910. Initially I could not get the offline charts working on a imon chart. I then installed another Renko chart builder indicator, which worked perfectly on a 1min chart and with your renko Street EA v1.64. Withy this indicator I have a 15day trial period. The nice thing here it is an indicator and not an EA and you can easily change the box sizes at a fly. I then installed your Chart Creator Ea on a 1hour chart and my off line charts worked perfectly. The Renko Street EAv1.64 opens trades whenever there is a reversal? This would then be triggered by a close above the EMA for a long or a short below the EMA? Is this assumption correct? A question: Lets presume one is in a long trade and there is a close below the EMA. Will the long trade be closed and opened with a short trade? Then in my demo account I have $25000. On the screenshots you will see that I have set the position size to be 5% of equity. However the EA opened only 0.01lot. It should have opened about 7 lots. Pls advise if I have done anything wrong.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
You set Free margin to zero! Set it to 5. And you don't have to set other settings to zero.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi MathTrader, if I uncheck the "Offline Chart" then the chart reverts back to a chart with the same time frame as the one where the Chart Creator EA was installed. When I close the platform and open it again, The Chart Creator EA is not there anymore and the MR offline chart is now a standard hourly chart. I am experiencing this on the FXDD build 902 platform. I am also running the IC Market Build 910 on a number of charts. The "Offline Chart" box is checked and I do not experience any problems. The only problem I have is that I cannot create off line charts based on the 1 min chart.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi Math can you please point me in the right direction here. If I want the EA to open a trade based on my equity of $10 000 (example) with a 10pip stop. This implies that the EA will open a trade with 1 lot size. But in the EA you specify also a lot size of 0.1 lots. So what setting will the EA use? Surely I should then enter a 0 for "Fixed Lot Size" and similiarly a 0 zero for the others. Or does the EA select which value is the greatest based on your equity? Anyway I will change the Free Margin to 5% and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
You select lot size calculation mode in the input settings of the EA ( Lot Size Mode ). If it is set to, for example, Free Margin % , then the EA only uses the value you set for the input setting Free Margin %. So, you don't have to set other inputs (Fixed Lot Size, Fixed Money and Balance %) to zero. The best way of trading with any EA, especially for Renko EAs, is to have them running on a VPS.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
You need to load more M1 history data. See this post .

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Sorry I somehow missed that input field. My blond moment for the day . Now everything makes sense

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I'll try later and let you know againHow bout the other pair that won't auto open position? Still same only work for EU / UJ till now... thanks you so much bring the good stuff

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi MathTrader, I have another question: "Initial Profit to Move SL" the default setting is 100. Am I correct in assuming that once your position is 10 pips in profit, then the trailing stop starts to work. In the default setting the Stop loss would then be 5 pips below? So if I increase the Initial Profit to 40 pips and make the trailing stop 40 pips then when the trade is on profit by 40 pips the trailing stop is at break even and then work itself up progressively as the profit increases?? Lastly what is the setting if I want to move the stop to break even after XXpips but have no trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
It is correct. Breakeven-only function has not been implemented. The EA trails the stop loss according to the input settings.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Ha at least I see that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Ok sofar it seems that everything is working on Build 910 on IC Market. Will keep you posted.

I unchecked the offline chart box and now the EA is opening trades and made a profitable trade overnight. I will add more pairs onto the VPS and let it run.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi, Newby here. First, Many thanks to Mathtrader7. I have just managed to get this up and running on 4 pairs, and im having the similar problem as mpradeep, the mt4 running this uses 30 to 40% of cpu compared to my other mt4's that only run between 0.5 to 5%, any ideas?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi kjg, there must something else wrong. On the IC platform I have 12 Renko charts open and on my Capital Index I have 6 Renko and 6 standard time charts.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hi MathTrader, thought I need to post an update. A winning trade on the GBPUSD. This trade was taken on demo, IC Market platform build 910. I have loaded 12 different charts on the platform and will monitor them. My live account is also running on Build 910 now. One last question, can you explain how the entries and exits are done. Exits if the TP is set to 0.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Here is Version 1.70 of the EA. In this version the problem of high CPU usage is solved. Note 1: This EA only works with non-gap Renko charts. You can download the required Renko builder EA from here . Note 2: This version is compiled and tested with MT4 build 910. Note 3: in order to let the EA work on Renko charts, you have to uncheck " Offline chart " option of the Renko charts. How to install this EA on your MetaTrader4 Platform For newbies, here is a video on youtube that shows how to install any EA on MetaTrader 4 platform in 5 easy steps

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Have and thanks... Is always necessary unckeck offline charts option? Regards

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Yes, it is necessary.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I don't know why, but when I drag the EA to the chart renko M2 chart nothing happen.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Thank you mathtrader, cpu problem solved.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
can someone tell me me, what is the best broker and what is the best pair for Renko EA trading..

--- 帖子 #440 ---
yup.. disable d * i try again... see work or not i tried with your lastest EA but seems like more laggy on my MT4 and also how do i check my MT4 version ya?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
From Help menu choose About

--- 帖子 #442 ---
If TP is set to zero, exit with profit is based on trailing stop

--- 帖子 #443 ---
hi mathtrader7 how can i update my mt4 version 902 to 910? terminal does not give me that option. regards fred

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Attached is terminal.exe build 910. You can replace your current MT4 terminal.exe with the attached to update your platform to 910. You need both parts to extract the whole file terminal.exe.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Be careful calling any update an upgrade.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
where we have to go to change them? regards fred

--- 帖子 #447 ---
If your MT4 is installed in the default directory, it would be at "C:\Program Files (x86)\MetaTrader4\terminal.exe"

--- 帖子 #448 ---
you can get it for free . dont forget to set it on 1 min chart and then open the renko from offline chart . 1 min feeds the renk chart and like that it never repaints. copy files in expert and close mt4 and reopen

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Thanks, do you use default settings? This don't look like the pic. in post #32???

--- 帖子 #450 ---
i did exactly as you said ,its still shows 902 version. fred

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi, i am doing all as per described but my chart is not atol visible as per the chart of skyler... can anyone help me.. how do i get same chart as per the same in this forum.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
cannot creat terminal exe.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Will the repainting renko street channel bother you? Does the EA trigger an order at the place where a circle shows up and later disappears? If it does, how can you deal with this problem? Will the repainting of renko street channel affect the result of backtesting?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Any suggestions of how to filter the false signals although they will disappear later?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
hello metatrader7 when i extract terminal 2 its saying this error message.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
You need a program that is able to extract RAR files, not ZIP files! For example, you can try the demo version of WinRAR for free.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
For those who forward test it on demo. Do you use ECN or MM model? I'm asking because on your balance report i cant see commissions. Opening 6Lot transaction for profit 150$ makes little sense. Just for consideraton MathTrader7, shouldnt we move BE a bit higher to cover that? Its most likely somewhere 0,0035% of lot value 2 times (open and close)

--- 帖子 #458 ---
hi mathtrader7, would you solve this issue. 1. i attached reanko ea with your direction last tuesday in pepperstone mt4 terminal. did not open yet. i did not uncheck offline chart. when uncheck offline chart then restart terminal then saw all chart converted to normal chart. did see offline chart. i use ea verson 1.5

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hello, MathTrader7, thank you for your ongoing development and support. I am testing v1.70. What entry signal(s) does this EA use to open trades?

--- 帖子 #460 ---
You have to uncheck Offline chart option. Otherwise the EA won't work! I personally use VPS to prevent the problem of restarting the MT4 platform.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Next week I compare this EA on FXCM and IC-market, default settings. Do You trade on fridays? Close open trades friday evening?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Where did u get those from? Have it ready for MACbook?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hello, I am experiencing a NON TRADING problem. I set the charts on amazon ws VPS and no trades for me so far. I did follow the instruction from post 434 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...05#post8602605

--- 帖子 #465 ---
hi metatrader7 I have changed my version to 910 and uncheck the offline on Renko charts , no trade made at all for 10 pairs. Any idea what cloud be the problem? Thanks Fred

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hey Math. Could you add in next version stochastic filtr? EA take option only, when candle reversal bounce of channel but need to be stoch overbought and oversold. I think its will increase % of accurate trades, coz stoch working really well in renko chart

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I will add stochastic filter in the next version.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Skyler, does the background colors in the Stoch repaints?. Red/Green. Could you post that indi?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Great work once again!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Yeah its repaint, but working not so bad. Detriment I dont have mql code of this indi, just ex4, so we cant code it

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Last week I had several pairs on a VPS which were making trades. I let it run constantly over the weekend, never restarting the terminal, and even added a few pairs before close. The charts show some tradeable points but none have been taken since Sunday open. Not sure if its due to the end of trading or other? Those using VPS, have you had problems after a trade week ends?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Not to me, I left it on a VPS but no trades at all http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...58#post8605158 Would you know what I am doing wrong ?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Sorry, no idea right now. All the settings are the same as they were last week. I will try restarting the EA on some pairs and see if that helps. I'll let you know but I suggest trying that. But DON't restart the chart just remove the trading EA and add it back.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Since sunday evening I let Ea run on IC-market and FXCM. Trades for usdcad, eurjpy, usdchf (2 trades) same trades on both brookers, and just now FXCM opened eurusd. Everything default. When I restart MT4, I first check "offline chart" on 2 minutes renko chart. After restart, uncheck again. Works perfekt

--- 帖子 #475 ---
same here, no trades since 2 days MT4 ver. 4.00 build 910. Offline chart un-checked. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any guesses team?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Mine is ver 1.70, MT4 build 910 I set it at 16 pairs. 17 trades were opened, no AUDUSD opened so far. Overall, 7 got SL (each -25 pips), 8 took profit at ave 8 pips, 2 are still running. There were about 130 pips lost.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
hi would you please include the MT4 910 Version compatible Renko Chart creator which you use. As most of the renko creators are very different. please do the needful.

--- 帖子 #478 ---

1.70 not working here on build 910. 1.60 version worked on build 902 not sure what's going on.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
which version has worked better till now?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
v 1.60 build 910 - GU. GA. EA x 2- long &amp; short - all winning trades overnight for me. Currently up in a UC position. FYI.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Running the EA for a few days now on 100 points brick size. All trades are closed on profit. Maybe its just luck.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
what settings you use?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I had exactly the same problem. EA did not restart trading after the weekend. I opened the EA properties and clicked OK to close (without changing anything) and the EA started trading again. Maybe something to do with the market being closed affecting the EA.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
My EA on VPS started after weekend. Latest client version.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
A (partial) work around to the H1 offline chart problem: For those (like me) who are frustrated by having the setup all the Renko Charts after restarting MT4 (which still seems to be a problem in build 910) I have developed a process that reduces the work of recreating all the charts. MT4 will correctly reload the offline charts when Offline chart is checked. Therefore, I have created two Profiles: one called Startup where all the charts have Offline chart still checked, and another profile called Running. When I restart MT4 I load the Startup profile, then immediately save it as Running (overwriting the Running profile if it is already there). You still need to go into each chart and uncheck Offline chart , but at least you don't have to set everything up from scratch. Here are the steps I use for the initial setup: 1. Open your M2 charts, leave Offline chart checked for now, and setup your indicators and EAs. (It's also worth saving your first M2 chart as a Template so that you can set charts up more quickly). 2. Once you have all your charts ready (with Offline chart still checked) save this setup as a new Profile (e.g. Startup). 3. BEFORE any more changes, save the Profile again with a different name (e.g. Running) Here are the steps for restating MT4. 1. Start/Restart MT4 2. Load the profile that has Offline chart still checked (e.g. Startup) 3. BEFORE making any changes to your charts, re-save this profile with a different name (e.g. Running) 4. Ensure that AutoTrading is enabled 5. For each of your charts, uncheck Offline chart . Hope this helps. If anyone has a quicker method please share.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thanks for the info. Interesting. I am now upgraded to build 910 with EV v1.70 so I'll see what happens over the coming weekend.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I created a Trade Explorer for the EA running on my VPS. You can find it on my profile or on top of this thread .

--- 帖子 #490 ---
HELLO, i can't find the EA in the posts, is it working?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hi Traders, I have been trading since March 2009. I trade the old skool way of price action &amp; some indicators. I aim for a minimum of 40 pips per day but I do about 105 on average. I have heard of RENKO but I don't know nothing about it! I have never looked at it to be honest. Had a quick look at the posts &amp; I kinda get the idea. Quick questions. Do all of the RENKO indicators re-paint? How do I get my bars to look like the ones in the posts? Thank you for helping me!

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi Mathtrader On Your backtest post 347, what Money management do You use? Default Free margin %? And what leverage? Regards

--- 帖子 #493 ---
MathTrader7, is this something that is possible to automate? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=567420

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Elovv, Yes, it is Free Margin percentage (1.0%). The leverage is 100:1. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hello MT7, I am testing v1.7 and the EA has been opening orders however a few days ago I inquired what signal/condition opens a new order but didn't receive any response. Please see the attachment where a trade was not opened where I believe it should have. Attached Image (click to enlarge) What signal/condition opens a new order? Please advise. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi t3ch, In version 1.7 the signal is based on the channel indicator, and a filter that I have implemented into the EA. If you want to trade every signal by the channel, you can use version 1.5 and disable trend filter. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Where is Version 1.7 Please?, i could not find it!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Post #434 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...05#post8602605

thanks buddy!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Thank you Math!!

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I atached the latest ver of this ea it looks like it works but I dont see the channel on the chart do I need to insert the indi of the channel (and where I find it?) or the ea does it itself? sorry if I sounds dumb its because I realy am. and completely new to renko

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I never trade with EA. I trade manually I use Mathtrader Chart creator EA and some Indicator for clue. Here is my template in renko chart.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
ok I added this: RenkoStreetChannel .ex4 I can see the channel do I need another indi? ma or something?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi saiffx,can you share your template pls

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi mate, All settings is same. I use 50 Point brick and 2 mn offline chart. Off course i use daily chart where i place Nongap CC EA. It helps me to to take decision slowly but smoothly. Then I use Renko channel, Renko trend, Trend session, Nihilist holygrail, Nihilist ultra trend v2, Nihilist Ultra ADX to enter and exit from the market. Nothing else. If anyone want can make easily. Thank you and MT7

--- 帖子 #506 ---
This is not MT7 thread

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Ok guys, This is my Renko strategy. Full system here. Happy trading for all.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Sorry for that.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
MT7 can you add new function to indicator- RenkoStreetChannel?? (attachment) I would like get alert (alarm) in MT4 platform and MT4 in my phone (MetaQuotesID function), when will appear new "dot" (green or red). Regards, pkiFX

--- 帖子 #510 ---
anybody has any idea why do i get this error message? i got this message" EA needs renko street chanal indicator" but i already attached that indicator to the renko chart. fred

--- 帖子 #511 ---
i mat trader, i wait three days. but not open any kind of trade yet. also uncheck offline charts. attached this ea about 20 pairs.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
You got Nihilist,Sonic,Renko and Renko channel. By my opinion it is very powerful combination

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I do not have the indicator source code. I haven't written it. If you can find the source code, I will add alert to it. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #514 ---
You have to copy the indicator RenkoStreetChannel.ex4 into &lt;MQL4\Indicators&gt; folder, and do NOT rename it! Leave it there so that the EA would be able to find it.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Which version of the EA are you running? Do you get any error message in the Experts tab of your terminal? What is the build version of your MT4 platform?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hey Renko lovers, For better understanding organised template is here.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Nice combination. How your results? I see you dont have any alarm for enter? You watching all the time chart?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Nice setup Saiffx!

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi guys, I test this EA on a demo konto on my PC. have the same problem as in post #487 if i restart mt4. Instead the offline chart opens mt4 the h1 Has anyone a better and faster solution? Regards

--- 帖子 #520 ---
The Offline chart have to be checked before you restart

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Ok, thanks guy Now I'm working with 2 profiles regards

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Works perfect. My demo on IC and FXCM ar up 2% since sunday evening. Everything default, 9 pairs. Thinking of when to stop trades on friday, close trade before trade stop or let it be. 2%/week is 180% up/year. Lets see after 1 month. Best

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Got as far as creating three offline charts and my pc ground to a halt.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Math, would it make sense to add EA options that allows for using standard MT4 indicators like ADX, and standard MT4 indicators for filters like stochastic, EMA like the image below? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #525 ---
The first version of an EA that trades based on ADX signals on non-gap Renko charts can be downloaded from here .

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hey t3chm could you tell me how much is the value of that brick? And in which TF you are generating that renko? Which is that MA? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Is the ADX one better or just the Simple Normal which one would be more profitable with less loss.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I found that chart here: http://forexholygrailbot.com/tag/best-renko-adx/

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Thanks Math. The backtests for RenkoADX have good average profit for winning trades vs loss trades. Have you tried using any filter(like Moving Average) as seen below to reduce the amount of losing trades: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #530 ---
No, I didn't try to additionally filter ADX signals with a moving average. I may do it in the next version...

--- 帖子 #531 ---
can someone teach me how to run or apply renko chart guys ?

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Elovv which setup are you using?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #534 ---
That's pretty good Elovv. What pairs and which version of the EA?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
EA Ver 1.70 EU, GU, UJ, AU, EJ, GJ, UCHF and UCAD 8 pairs (said 9 before) everything default.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi mate, Some of us asked me in PM box about entry and exit rules of my Renko trading system. This PDF manual for those RENKO lovers. Thanking you, saiffx

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Gotta love PA heroes. They surely can talk the talk but I have yet to see a single one of them walking the walk. All those legends about how PA is the most profitable way to trade never cease to amuse me. PA trading has it's fair share of gurus, claiming to make a living by trading the charts naked. I for one, prefer to have an objective way to enter a trade. Both indicators and PA can be profitable, as it comes down to MM in the end. I don't see why would anybody start bashing the thread. Anyway, I'll set up the system during the weekend, it's always nice to broaden my horizon. Thanks to the OP for sharing. Regards Balazs

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hello Saiffx, but if you apply renko to a Daily chart then the renko candles will repaint itself after the close of each daily candle. Is it rigth or am I wrong? Regards

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Is Half trend set to defaults or?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hi mate, From where I collect half trend-1.02 they suggest to use default setting and they also said it's a Non repainting indicator. Though I don't believe any indicator. Just use indicator for clue ................only. But I believe following all the rule of manual can brings good result. Yea I use default setting for half trend-1.02. Thanks..........

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi mates, Somebody love Pivot indicator in their trading. Renko lovers can use this indicator in RENKO CHART.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
thank you a lot my friend

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi mate, You are right. If anyone close metatrader platform at any time Renko chart always re-arrange bricks and its trend. But We just follow its visual chart. Nothing is magic in Forex market we all know. We have to overcome through our knowledge and experience. Price always show its character (up and down) but we have to enter the market in right time and also exit in right time. Discipline, patience and money management is the key we all know. Off course we use stop loss in each entry. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
MathTrader7, any chance you get us a tip how to backtest it? Normally i create "fake" server and Renko chart in standard time frame (5min) to use for backtesting but this time tester still screams for "Please attach the EA to a non-gap Renko chart!" Attached Image (click to enlarge) i see you backtest in 1min chart with control points method. How do you do it? Thanks

--- 帖子 #545 ---
nevermind, i made it Poor modeling quality due to 1m used instead of ticks. Good thing is that backtest overlaps with 1 week forward test, EURUSD opened at the same time with the same results. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'll play a bit with optimization

--- 帖子 #546 ---
will be good if you show entries and exits in live trades to facilitate understanding of your method

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi Adam. which version did You backtest

--- 帖子 #548 ---
1.70, i think its the latest

--- 帖子 #549 ---
If you could please help me out, i dont know why but whenever i try to attach this EA Ver 1.70 or any other it doesent work just nothing happens Ver 1.00 is the only one that works i dont know why and mt MT4 Build is 910.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
hello mine is same things.i use version 910 ,EA does not work at all neither.never open any trade in more than 10 pairs. dont find any solution for that. regards fred

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Great to see that you managed to backtest it!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
thx BTW i see some negative impact of trading between 5 - 6PM. Could be coincidence but also trading at night (GMT+1) is pointless due to low profit and broker commissions that will spoil the balance - even to negative. How about adding a trading hours? i use to do it in my EAs..

--- 帖子 #553 ---
This will definitely make the EA more stronger! Thanks for sharing your work so far!

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Adam, You mean EA from post 434, not the ADX EA from post 525? Regards

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Adam could you mark market open lines on your profit chart? thanks Bob

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Bad news...after over 1 week of test back and forward test on demo same broker here'e my summary: Attached Image Good thing: EA opens correctly on both tests Bad thing: Back-testing shows different close (more pips - higher profit) than forward-testing (less pips - lower profit) Whats your results guys?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
what you expect from an EA who depends in a repainting indi, a high volatility market will kill you

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I tested ver 1.7 last week with not so good results.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
A noob question: how do you strategy test this EA? I've seen test results around here, but can't figure it out how to choose the M2 timeframe when starting the tester. I'm on MT4 920, if it matters.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi, look at the combination of Renko + ADX + Stochastic. Currency pair: GBPUSD Renko size = 10 pips How to trade: 1. Take ADX sell signal only if both stochastic lines are below 50; 2. Take ADX buy signal only if both stochastic lines are above 50; 3. SL = 35 pips or valid signal in the opposite direction; 4. TP = 90 pips or valid signal in the opposite direction; 5. When profit reaches 20 pips , close 80% of the position (thus we guarantee small profit, even if SL is hit by the price action) For November 2015 - 14 winners and 1 loss. Not a bad candidate for EA. All indicators and template are attached.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks Saiffx for sharing this nice system. it is clean and beautiful. Maybe it is a lot more to ask but is it possible for you to start a new thread for this system so we can follow you better? Thanks, -Henry

i am not sure what you mean, but the renko ea you only put on a 1 min chart and than you open the offlinechart and now you see renkobricks. you do not close the 1 min chart where the ea is on. if you want a 1 h or any other timeframe you have to open another chart. http://prntscr.com/99g22o

Does the RenkoStreet_Trend indicator Repaint? Tried testing it on a backtester using Candlesticks and it started repainting

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Darius, i am testing ver 1.70. Probably will have to check the other

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi guys! Please tell me how I can test this EA ver 1.70 using non-gap Renko charts. Write a manual or give a link with detailed instructions. Thanks

--- 帖子 #476 ---
can anyone shares the best time frame on which the renko system using offline charts can be trade. i do know that Renko doesnt mean with time frame.. but as per logics price action does move as per time frame and we as trader do need to know a good time frame using which we can trade the system with less fakouts

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Did you make some backtest? It could be good for some short period of strong trend but question is if it's better in longer period. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
In long periods you must changed the setting. You need more room.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Mathtrader! I can see on Your Trade Explorer that Renko Street have good result. Have You change settings? Non 16-Nov 19 whas not good, 7 losses, 1 win. After that its very good. Are settings default? Regards Elovv

--- 帖子 #480 ---
And do You run EA 24 hours a day?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
The first 7 trades were taken with another EA. I use the default settings of v1.7 of the EA except for money management which is Fixed Money (50 USD risk per trade per symbol). I run it on four major pairs: EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD and USDCAD. Yes! The EA is running on my VPS 24/7

im trading versiion 1.7 on mt4 build 920 it hasn't taken any trades in 3 days any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
v 1.7 open positions, but only loose. Is a good system, but something is missing other filter maybe.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
1. Is 1m chart with chartcreator open? 2. Is 2m Renko chart offline option un-checked?

--- 帖子 #608 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #609 ---
mathtrader7,i have idea. if is possible make EA ,where is option to allow take only short signals,or only long,than we can watch daily graphic (not renko),and follow trend in daily if trend is long then set EA take only long signals,an in settings we can take bigger tp and trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I believe you already have the option under the common option in property of the ea. You can choose long, short or long&amp;short.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
oh thanks.I got yes

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Does the EA work or not? I think it missed 2 entries, if I understood well how it works. Am I missing anything? Attached Image (click to enlarge) If it matters, I'm on XM broker, MT4 920.

lastest version not working for me so i just use v1.5 tested after 24hour... so far result is not bad... but.. i face a problem is... example EU up trend - Long ok EA enter this... but after few hour i checked it sell EurAud( uptrend ) so... possible to avoid problem like this? thanks Note: can someone share your TP/ TS setting? possible to make it TP after touched next signal?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Mathtrader7, could you tell which filter do you use in the latest versions? I'm planning to test your EA in semiautomatic mode, so just trying to understand which version should I use. Also I have a suggestion, since the ea suits range market better (channel indicator does't show the signals in the strong trend): add a filter, which measures the vertical distance in pips during single market session. Example: inputs: time begin 9:00 time end 15:00 min distance 50 pips If the price moves at least 50 pips in the one direction during this time, then after 15:00 the ea looks only for the signals in opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hello guys, version 1.7 is missing MA trend filter. With this version i have only loss, as its opening position incorrect and several times. I return back to version 1.5 which has this filter Have a nice day

--- 帖子 #616 ---
yes and yes

--- 帖子 #617 ---
OK, after a quick test I can tell you don't waste your time on this one. I would say it wouldn't be easy to find worse indicator

My way to trade renko : RENKO CREATE Size 10 TF 2 Indicator DMI Entry: Buy: candle close with green arrow Sell: candle close with red arrow Take Profit: Buy: Next candle close at higher - or more higher Sell: Next candle close at lower - or more lower Stop Lose: Buy: Next candle close at 2 lower Sell: Next candle close at 2 higher You can also use martingale to trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What is the final version of this system. I want to trade this manually. Can anyone summarize the whole system in one post with indicators and template so that I can use it for my trading. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I like this system for its simplicity and will try next week on a demo account, I also plan on trying with CFDs (US30 for example). My setup is very similar to the original post and I am using MathTrader7 work for plotting the Renko chart. I compiled everything into a single zip file attached to this post. I also included my template with a color scheme that is close to the first post. Enjoy and thanks for your work. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi All, I really like what the TmaSlope does, only problem is it repaints like crazy. Any ideas on what I can use that will give the same indication without the repaint? Was thinking MACD? Settings perhaps?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
​@KevinSt9,i too really love this system but it repaints like crazy,is there any senior members out there on FF who knows how to filter out the bad signals?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
As mentionned in my post, I tried with some CFDs on US30.I on demo account this evening (~1h30 span). Base chart is M1 and I added M2 to generate the Renko. Still finetuning, tweaking and experimenting, just consider this as a quick diary from the laboratory. For US30, I put the Renko brick size to 6. My lot size is 2 US30.I (~17.3k), I tried with 1 US30.I first. I'm trying to add some other indicators, currently looking at ADX and volatility. It's not worth trying to play with the Renko if there are no steep valleys and mountains, peaks must be clear. I summarized my first attempts in this table, I did not pay much attention to the 200 EMA for the moment but it would definitely discard some weaker entries, I wanted to test it in "long &amp; short" mode.

Looking at the 1 trade that's still open, I am suspecting that the trailing stop settings (currently left at default) can be optimized.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Ok, made some minor tweaks. Just to clarify, I'm running version 1.7. Because I found a lot of the trades from yesterday were stopped out prematurely, I have now decided to forward test with these settings: Attached Image The setup/pairs list I'm running this on are: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Will leave this on until the end of the year (or until I hit a ridiculous drawdown) and see what happens.

im not familiar with renko . how can i make my m2 chart live . it is offline and price is stuck . how can i trade by using offline chart ? how does chart update? thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Tarvold , I already did like what you do now , Drawdown more than 40 % after running four days , and it's completely logic when you see in one pair continuous 4 ST hitted . Real problem that version 1.7 without any filter , so my advice that don't waste your time about this version , we hope that MathTrader7 could add real filter , specially that he said version 1.9 give good results .

hey eCris any updates on your demo? is it the TE on your profile? thanks

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Quick update. So being the sucker for pain that I am, and since it's a demo account anyway, I left ver 1.7 running. Since the week's open so far, (about 2 hours ago), it's lost 1% of account. BTW, I am not posting this to diss Math or Skyler... I think Math has done brilliant work in coding this, and they are both very generous to share this with us. I just didn't see anyone post an extensive forward test, so.... well.... here it is. I truly hope the next version will be profitable.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
8 hours into the week so far, and I'm about to hit about 10% drawdown. Seems consistent with your stats. Turning it off now. It's been fun.

Nice that you see it by yourself without wasting time , Hope that new version with real filter coming soon . MT7 testing ver 1.9 hope he will post it soon to try

Hi, thanks MathT7RS for coding this trading startegy. I just came to this topic after looking to make HGB working on Renko chart. Triger and filter criteria are exactly what I wanted to implement, but could not find a way until I started to read this topic on forum. I ma trading this EA life with small lots as it is only way to validate its performance. So far I have positive results and feeling about this bot. However,I would like to suggest some possible optimization to increase profitability and security during traiding. MathT7RS, could you consider to add: 1. Multiply trading by enetering buy/sell stops when entering main trade. Let's say multitrade will be opened every new candle opens in the same direction and closed at 1.5 candle profit or close all of them with main trade trigered by chanel line and change in candle direction. In this case we will have 2 trades per pair, similarly like in Steve Hopwood/Bob's HGB EA attatched or Captain's Renko EA or huge profit when kept to the end. Attached File(s) Holy Graily Bob.mq4 210 KB | 1,273 downloads Attached File(s) The Captain's auto trading robot by Steve Hopwood.mq4 25 KB | 989 downloads 2. Also, it would fantastic to have security level as in atatched Shall EA, regarding min. margin left, time between trades, etc. Attached File(s) ShellAutoTradingRobotCode_BobStuff_6xx.mq4 147 KB | 992 downloads Cheers,

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi MT7RS, Additional thought to make this Renko more profitable. I have changed arrows with super signal to take additional trades as breakout approach on top what we have today. Do you see possibility to add this option to your bot like on attached pic. to take mechanickly advantage of strong trend? Attached Image I attached indi generating those arrows. They are in opposite direction, but changing 233/234 numbers will correct direction. Attached File(s) super-signals-channel1.mq4 2 KB | 1,053 downloads Cheers

Dear all,use my strategy on 15tf offline chart is better. Never set dailytf offline chart.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Why does timeframe matter if it's renko?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
In my experience,dailytf offline chart will cause candle repaint. I have no idea. Best regard Tai

--- 帖子 #655 ---
isnt the 15 min timeframe renko repainting too ? The 1 minute has to be the best option imo.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Attached Image First time posting a screenshot so hoping it shows up properly. This is a concept that for whatever reason is seems rarely discussed on forums. The idea is that when you get an initial signal to buy or sell. There is for the most part an initial retracement before the "signal" move. The reason i'm showing this is how to get a better entry and minimize risk. If this doesnt post properly I will will figure it out. Fid

--- 帖子 #657 ---
These are fib levels and the minimum retracement is 50%. In other words...if it doesnt pull back at least 50% there is no entry. So once you get the signal on the renko strategy. No need to rush into the trade it will retrace. Then you get in around the 50%. and front run the price by the pip spread + 3 on the given pair. Hope if helps. Fid

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Ah cool. That makes more sense. My solution to this is to use a non standard tf for renko like 2-3min.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hi Fiddy, What you explained needs a statistical analysis to find out how it would improve the performance of a Renko trading strategy who suggests to open a position at a Renko reverse candle. Best, Math

MathTrader7 , You are the Man and big master of indicators especially expert in Renko versions. Guys can anybody Add Numbers on the TOP of Each Renko Brick and make those Numbers represent TIME aka 0= &lt;1 min; 1 = &lt;2min; 3=&lt;3 min, and so on. The biggest problem in Renko is when you hit RANGE, 2 bricks up 2 bricks down ( Usually SLOW not moving period) and you get loss here and loss there as a result.. Almost all trends start with fast move in the direction, SO fast Renko BAR will represent possible Profitable ENTRY.. Same goes for Take profit, ones move is losing steam /speed is also slowing down and that's the time to Exit the trade. Look it could be not the Numbers but COLORS, let's say Slow bar down direction lite RED fast down bar DARK red.. And same for LONG lite Green/Dark Green... Just an idea, but the Numbers will tell the Story... I saw such Renko Bars Somewhere ones, but Cannot find it.. Thank you.

Hello MathTrader7 and everyone. Why it doesn't work MathTrader7_RenkoStreetEA_1 . 7 . ex4 . In 2015, the Advisor worked, and from the beginning of 2016 it did not open any orders . Is there t ime protection in the EA ??? how it to remove ? Have anybody these problems ? The option is removed with the offline charts, no errors in log. There are a lot s ignals in this year.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Tai927, i've set it up with your settings. It looks good. I got 3 questions: - In your examples a few posts ago, i see lots of arrows. If i set DMI as you describe on TF240 there wont be lots of arrows. So, are you using different settings? - in your description you say: SL is another signal (the other side). A few posts before you show you put SL 1 or 2 bricks at the otherside. So which rules are the right ones? - Do you use any trademanager to babysit the trades? It looks like an interesting setup, so thank you for that. Its still a bit fuzzy with the rules. So if you can explain, will preciate!

You don't have to uncheck it anymore. I solved this problem in my non-gap renko builder EA.

well i been comparing the repainting to the non repainting renko. i'm not 100% sure but i'd like to know when the top of the channel forms or the bottom.(havnt used on live chart yet). is it after it goes up or down one box? if so i been testing it and it seems that with proper 1:2 and above money management this is a guaranteed profit system. also if price breaks below a 1 to 1 profit and retraces back up close at break even. am i reading this indicator wrong???? also trailing stop above 1:2 would be a money maker???

ok ive live tested this indicator. this indicator will give a buy or sell signal and if it keeps going up or down it will keep replotting the signal. so if it gives you a sell signal and you get in, it can keep going up and it will set the signal at the new high or low. indicator deleted!!!!! dont waste your time. just my opinion.

Hello, I would to talk you about your chart that your posted. I also found a flex renko chart who not repainting. Like you said, there are no best who are free. I bought the mine.

renko street is crap. I have used it. the indicators repaint and even back paint several bars. the best you can do is price action alone and even then with renko do not think it is so easy however renko type charts do simplify things as far as noise, and identification of support and resistance.

Hello Guys, I am looking for an EA with following simple rules. Variable (Default Value) Lot Size 0.1 Trade Buy &amp; Sell Buy Only Sell Only Trading Time Zones USA &amp; London USA Only 24 Hours Maximum Trades per pair 1 ( If a trade is already open for a pair, it should NOT open another one.) 2 (2 trades (one buy and one sell) could be open. For example, if entry mode is 2nd bar and exit mode is 3rd bar. EA opened a sell entry after completion of 2 red bars then market reversed and 3 blue bars appeared. EA should open another buy trade at the completion of 2nd blue bar and should close sell at the completion of the 3rd bar.) Entry 1st Bar (At the completion of 1st Bar) 2nd Bar (At the completion of 2nd Bar) Blue/Orange Dot (EA should open buy entry once blue dot with bar completed and sell entry once orange dot with bar completed.) Exit 1st Bar (At the completion of 1st Bar of opposite color) 2nd Bar (At the completion of 2nd Bar of opposite color) 3rd Bar (At the completion of 3rd Bar of opposite color) Exit Manually (Don’t let EA close the trade) EMA Value 30 (It could be changed to any particular value) EMA Filter Off On (Once on, it should open only Sell Trades below EMA and Buy Trades above EMA as per above set rules. For example, if entry is selected at the completion of 2nd bar and 2nd bar completed just above/below EMA then it should open a trade.) Renko Street Trend Filter Off On (Whatever entry method selected above, it should get confirmation from Renko Street color before opening trade. Green for Buy, Red for sell.) Take Profit 1000 Points (100 Pips) Stop Loss 0 Points Buy Stop Enter Price Buy above given price (EA Should not buy below given price) Sell Stop Enter Price Sell below given price (EA Should not sell above given price) In case, we make changes in setting of EA or we close the EA, it should not close already open trades. Please see attached files for further details. Let me know in case of any query. Thanks

Hello skyler, what's sessions do you turn on the Ea?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Well said zamanib. Too many people think that indicators don't repaint or that there is a "Forex Magic Formula" that will ensure that all trades are winners. Forex trading requires learning and trying different systems until you have one that suits you but, more importantly, it requires patience. It looks like that many people don't have the patience required to learn a new system and even less trading it.

Hi, normally on MT4 you have to use offline chart to enable Renko charts to work. Do you just place the indicator on the Indicator folder and it will work? I wish it was the same like on Ninjatrader where it is much easier to place Renko indicator.

It does like ALL Renkp chart builders.

Place it in the indicators folder, restart MT4, load it on your M1 chart then open the M2 offline chart.

Thanks a lot for your quick response. Is there a way to make the bricks e.g. 10 pips to be thicker ? I see they are very thin. Great work.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
in MT4, place in indicator folder. Then refresh /reload your terminal. Open your pair like XAU/USD, use any timeframe u want. I normally use 15Minutes. Then file &gt; open offline &gt; select XAU/USD M2 or whatever min the RENKO INDI that you choose (M2, M3, M4 etc)

Hi, Thank you so much ! Looks amazing... I'm trying to find a good combination to use with DAX (GER30)

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Can you explain on the %, = SHIFT? 20 pips = 5%? Thanks

--- 帖子 #714 ---
First you choose the Pips/brick size say 10 like in the screenshot. Mind you that means for a Bearish to Bullish change in direction, price has to move 2 times the pips size. The shift is the incremental pips movement if you need a new bar printed with 10% movement which is 10% of 10pips = 1pip or you want 30% of 10pips = 3pips you indicate your choice in the Box_Shift_Percent field. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here I have chosen 10pips Brick size and 50% Shift Percent which is 5 pips.

Hi udeltaforex, I'm trying out your system on demo, is this still the current version or do you have an updated one? Perhaps with buy/sell alarm? Also, do you have EA for it that you could share? Thanks in advance.

Dear MathTrader7 I have a project with a robot with incredible results but I need help with some programming codes to make it more robust. This robot works with common renko bricks. Attached image of the year 2018 report. If you are interested please send a private message

Hi mathtrader do you have any recommendation a good indicator?

--- 帖子 #726 ---
ATR is one of the best indicstors...

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I agree that the ATR is one of the best indicators. Two indicators that are also very good are the Infoboard (that indicator includes ATR) and the Absolute strength histogram.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Hi Mathtrader, Would you possibly be able to assist me with a simple EA, i am testing a new renko indi out. This should be simple for you. 1- If price is above 50 EMA and 10 EMA only buy 2- if ADX is curved upwards and crosses 78 level 3- If above conditions are met, on the open on the 3rd green brick open a buy 4- Place SL 10 pips below last low 5- Exit trade on close of first red brick Vice versa for Sell. I hope I make sense, and really hope you can help. I have read all your posts and salute you for all you efforts in assisting us that are unable to do what you do. Thanks Math!

hello everyone iam a newbie and i use renko been trading for year and half i have read the whole thread got everything , but .... can anyone tell me why is the latest version of his ea is not working or is blocked by author ??? thanks

--- 帖子 #736 ---
can someone help me ? I'm trying to perfect a strategy on renko charts in detail: I have 4 EA Manager, to automatically set SL and TP, and all 4 do not work on this chart, I searched on google and more, but I have not found an EA manager for this purpose that works on Renko Charts, can anyone point me to something valid? if it also has the stealth function (to hide TP SL from the broker) even better! I won't be home this weekend, I'll try to share the renko strategy with you, while I continue to test the strategy ... I hope some of you have a working EA manager.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Good morning. Your Renko chart is currently set up like this (see yellow mark) For any EA to work, it must be set as the second image (see yellow mark)

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Zamaniba never answered you but here is the answer. This is a geometric Renko chart shifted 10%. Attached is the original Zamaniba chart with my DAX Renko 100 pips ($10) also shifted 10%. I also attached the indicator to produce normal, median and geometric Renko charts. This indicator can also produce 2 Renko charts for the same pair. Enjoy

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Hi Hutch, I loaded that in my indicator folder &amp; expert folder, but can't get it to produce an offline chart or attach to chart. Any suggestions? tks, cdk

--- 帖子 #740 ---
It is an indicator not and expert. There are two ways to get a new indicator to work properly: 1. In the navigator refresh the indicators; or 2. Close the MT4 and restart it.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Never mind, I figured it out. tks, cdk

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Reading this thread some traders have problem with no gap Renko EA. Attached are two charts. The first one is the same as the one in post #738 above but using Renko parallel mode. It shows little difference from that chart because of the high Renko brick size of 100 pips and the shift of 10%. The second chart shows only the normal Renko parallel mode shifted 100% (normal Renko chart). The indicator is also attached. Now you have more choices to choose your favorite chart

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hello, I've been reading this thread and I've tried the EAs from MathTrade7 and they are not working on my MT4 platform Build 1260 (offline unchecked box ), they are not open trades or not even working. Anybody with same issue? I tried all EAs versions. Thanks, Luis

--- 帖子 #744 ---
sorry for my very bad english. I am using the translator I started today with a small deposit on the real account and I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the development of this topic

--- 帖子 #745 ---
The indicator that I posted in post #742 above produces the same chart as MathTrader7 except that it can also produce geometric parallel Renko charts. As you can see it's working properly

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi Hutch, I was refering to the EAs created for this strategy, not for EAs that build Renko Charts. Thanks, Luis

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hello How can i use the indicator for forex pairs. I want it shifted for 10% but for 3 pip size bricks. If someone could help me i would be thankful. Thank you,

Hi MathTrader7, I am trying to load MT7_RenkoStreetEA last version with a RenkoNonGap chart (using your ChartBuilder in thread https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=535170 ) but it shows me the message "Please attach the EA to a non-gap Renko Chart". What am I doing bad? OTherwise, with MT7_RenkoEA works fine. Thanks mate for all your help!

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Problem solved, I rename RenkoStreetChannel indicator as originally, and it works fine, thanks!

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hello everyone. I want to thank skyler for the idea of the system. Also, special thanks to MathTrader7 for automating the system and constant support. And also to everyone who shares their ideas and improvements. I tried the system in manual mode and liked its simplicity and clarity. Everything was fine until I decided to install an automatic version. I am new to working with Renko and may not have taken into account some things in the installation. At first I set the graph type M1 Then i drop on the M1 chart MathTrader7_RenkoChartCreatorEA with standard settings. After that it automatically opens the Chart with Renko M3.i drop on this chart MathTrader7_RenkoStreetEA. ...and the system does not trade. I bet with and without the channel indicator. The result is the same-there are no deals. Trading with expert advisors is allowed in the terminal settings. Help me make this thing work . I will be very grateful for any help. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hello Math and Sky! First of all thank you for the amazing guy's that you are for sharing! But like others arround here we allways have the message " please use the EA in a renko no gap " I have tried everything and every versions with on/off offline chart and allways get the same error... my mt4 build is the 1280. You think its beacuse of that? Really want to try this amazing EA Best Regards

Why are people using these 100 % stupid and useless repaint indicators ?

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Whether an indicator repaints or not it's not relevant. What matter is how the indicator works and the level of knowledge of traders using them. By the comment you made I know you will not believe this but some repainting indicators are sometime better than indicators that don't repaint. Learning to use repainting indicators is part of learning how to trade.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
If you could trade you don't use any indicators at all.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
doesnt mean you use indicator, you dont know how to trade.. you're a boastfull bastard bro!

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Dont just say it, Prove it ! Almost of all indicators are junk, but repainting indis take it to a whole another level.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Because sometimes it feels good to be fooled or to fool other people too

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Well you made your statement but did not offer any proof. Here is proof that the repainting indicator I use for my day trading is a lot better than three non-repainting indicators of the same category. Please show me a HalfTrend non-repainting indicator that is as good as the one I use in my daily trading. All the HalfTrend indicators shown in the pictures have an amplitude of 2 that I use to trade the DAX using Renko (last hour of trading Friday). HalfTrend TT [x5v4] repaints but gives excellent signals of trend reversal and rarely repaints. Do you see a problem with that indicator? Half-Trend NRP_Mladen doesn't repaints but gives signals 2 bars after HalfTrend TT and sometime gives a signal when the trend has ended (second green arrow at 22:53 then a few more). HalfTrend 2 and Half-Trend-buy-sell-indicator don't repaint but also sometime give signals when the trend has ended. I suspect that these two indicators are copy cats of the original Half-Trend NRP_Mladen indicator. If you don't have a problem with these 3 non-repainting indicators use them in your trading. I prefer the HalfTrend TT [x5v4] repainting indicator

So you buy when it goes from red to green and sell when it goes from green to red ? You don't need an indicator at all

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Less than a month ago you didnt even know your indi repaints after a candle close so it may take you again a bit of time to realize that a repainting indi has no predictive value over its NRP version. On your first hindsight chart, you see all those early signals ? Nice, do you also see the late signals ? No ? Because its the job of your repainting indi to hide all the late/bad entries and make it look cuter than it really is. Thats why the only proof you can bring, is a repainting indi on an hindsight chart with early signals everywhere. If your repainting indi also got some late signals, please post some screenshots of those.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Please take a look at the second sell arrow (22:52) on the HalfTrend TT chart again. Between that sell arrow and the buy arrow at the bottom of the chart there were 2 instances of 2 green bars when the HalfTrend TT indicator did not trigger a buy signal. If I exclusively bought/sold every time there was a color change I would not need the HalfTrend TT indicator. Please note that, in both cases, the 2 instances of 2 green bars would have produced 2 losing trades. Good enough reason for me not to trigger a trade every time there is a color change.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
You are right stating that I did not know that the HalfTrend TT repainted because it had never happened to me but a trader showed me that it did repaint. The reason I had not seen it repaint on me is that I don't use low value Renko bars that traders must use to get any good trade on low ATR pairs. Ok I will post screenshots of late HalfTrend TT signals if I see them but it's highly unlikely on high ATR pairs traded with decent size Renko bars. You can also post screenshots of late HalfTrend TT signals if you want. Please note that there is nothing wrong with the late signals of the Half-Trend NRP_Mladen, HalfTrend 2 and the Half-Trend-buy-sell-indicator since they were probably designed to give signals only after the trend had been confirmed while the HalfTrend TT doesn't wait for further confirmation of the trend.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Im absolutely waiting for this.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I did not get a late signal from HalfTrend TT but I received a bad sell signal at 21:48 today as shown by the "x". This is rare but it happens. No indicator is perfect so I'm still waiting for a late signal.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Actually you could consider the signal at 21:48 a late signal since there were two red bricks prior to these at 21:02 and 21:22 that didn't generate a signal.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Ho Hutch, trading DAX30 10 pips bricks do you use default input settings with Half Trend Indicator or could you suggest another set up? Thank you

--- 帖子 #768 ---
No matter what I trade I use a factor of 2 for the HalfTrend TT since it gives good signals on Renko. The default factor of 1 probably works best on time based charts but I don't trade them except for D1 but I don't use any HalfTrend on those.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I did not get a late signal from HalfTrend TT but I received a bad sell signal at 21:48 today as shown by the "x". This is rare but it happens. No indicator is perfect so I'm still waiting for a late signal. I already posted the late signals now I'm posting what I thought was nearly impossible, repainting on Renko brick size of 20. The first chart shows a down arrow but it disappeared in the second chart after the new Renko brick is positive. The redeeming feature is that at the time the down arrow appeared the FxBay MACD was still positive as it had not yet crossed the zero line so I should not have closed the trade. However, the wick convinced me that it was a reversal and it was time to close the trade.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Actually this x should be your holy grail signal, if you sold at the next up bar, this is garanteed 20 pips. Vice versa for buy. If you check your history, you ll see that it never fails not even once. Very easy to spot especially when you have that much experience with your repainting indi. Now go make your millions.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Nothing new for me nor you, so why do you fool yourself and/or others with those hindsight arrows on your charts ?

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Hi Guys. Wanna say hi to you all and I am new to Renko chart. Happened to learn about this Jap chart type. Seems Renko is very simple to read and able to apply very simple rules to create a profitable system. I use strategies involving Price Actions and S/R, and running a few EAs on MT4 to auto open/close trades. May I ask for your experience on whether a EA bot can work well on an offline Renko chart and open/close trades? On the other hand I was experimenting mixing Renko bars with normal candles (Or Renko-like price segments), and found something interesting. Seems a good setup in Renko supported by Engulfing Candles on normal candles [0]-[2] would turn out to be a higher chance winner. Haven't tested it yet but will let you guys know when I have time to look into it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I'm not fooling myself or anybody else the HalfTrend TT probably repaints one time a month on a Renko 20 pips chart and many times a day on Renko 2 to 5 pips charts. Don't you think that the HalfTrend TT is way better than non-repainting HalfTrend indicators that always provide a signal one brick after the HalfTrend TT and quite often when the trend is almost over?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Thank you for putting me on your ignore list I guess you can't handle the truth Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Hello and thank you for your work. I tried to follow your terms but after 2 renko 10.0 bricks, the arrow repainted, disappeared, and I lost the trade. And when I test it in other pairs, it repeats, of course mostly occurs in 5.0 bricks. Cant add a scrrenshot right now, but saved it if you want to see

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Last Friday a trader sent me a private message to learn more about my strategy. Here was my reply " It's a simple system and you would think that following the arrows is all you have to do and you would be right most of the time but not always. The main component of my system is the FxBay MACD. If the MACD line just crossed the zero line on the way up it's a buy and the opposite for a sell. Although rare the Half Trend TT sometime gives a bad signal. It happened to me yesterday when it gave a sell arrow signal when the FxBay MACD had not crossed the zero line on the down side so I did not take the sell trade but I still closed my buy trade just in case the next brick would be red. The Half Trend TT repaints but this is also rare so you always need to rely more of the FxBay MACD instead of the Half Trend TT. I just posted a WTI chart with Renko 10 pips in the link https://www.energyexch.com/thread/post/13218531#post13218531 As you can see there are 4 arrows. The first 3 are perfect trades since the FxBay MACD zero line crossed at the Renko brick after the arrow printed. The last arrow is most likely a repainter and, if this is the case, will disappear when the next brick is formed. This is because the size of the Renko brick is a big 25.2 pips as shown by the Infoboard indicator (Current Bar Hi-Lo) and looking at the FxBay MACD you can see that the MACD line is quite far from the zero line. On a bad signal the arrow stays but you can clearly see that the zero line of the FxBay MACD had not crossed or had crossed only a little before continuing in the same direction. You can say that these are tips but they are not tricks. The bottom line is that you have to learn to follow the Half Trend TT and the FxBay MACD with a third indicator which is the best that you have it's called your eyes. This system is quite good at trading anything using Renko 10 pips or bigger (best are all GBP pairs and CFDs) but but I would not recommend it for trading low ATR pairs such as EURUSD or USDCAD since you would need Renko of 5 pips or less. The more you trade that system the better you will get at discerning anomalies and detecting them will increase your profits." The link shows Friday's chart and as I thought the arrow was a repainter and disappeared at the start of Monday's trading when the red brick became fully formed then was followed by a light blue brick. Here is Friday's and Monday's WTI chart and you will see that the arrow disappeared but you will also see that the FxBay MACD never crossed the zero line on the down side. As I said it's a good strategy but like all strategies it takes time before you learn it enough to master it.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
It is worthless like all repainting indis, save yourself some time and drop it.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Of course for you it's worthless like all repainting indicators. This is because you haven't learned yet on how to use all indicators properly and especially those that repaint. Instead of complaining you need to post your strategy to prove to traders here that it's better than mine.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Metta I'm still waiting for you to post your "not repainting" strategy. Meanwhile look at what happened a few minutes ago. It was easy to detect that the arrow was a false signal and would disappear. This is how real traders take advantage of repainting indicators and not fooled by them

--- 帖子 #393 ---
And as your MACD was still above 0 line you wouldn't have taken the trade anyway.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
To those who are complaining about repainting indicator or lagging, here some 2 cents advice. Price action, candlestick patterns, and chart patterns are lagging tools as well. A daily timeframe candle is only formed after the market close A chart pattern can only be developed after a series of candles So, isn’t it a repaint or lagging tool as well? Unless you are the Broker everything you using to trade is unknown and is lagging and repainting, only the broker knows his order flow and how the charts will paint or form.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Still pissed that i called you out on your bs repainting indicator ?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Sorry but I have never been pissed off at you or anyone else. Everybody is entitled to his opinion and, even if it's negative in the eyes of other traders, it adds value to the FF community. Some traders over react to mild comments and put traders who made comments they didn't like on their ignored list. Since I respect everybody I don't have any trader on my ignored list. The most number of traders I have seen on an ignored list is 850. I guess that trader is quite frustrated and refuses all opinions that don't match his. Happy trading
