Hi Folks, I wanted to share the system I'm developing to gather opinions and criticisms from more experienced traders. I've only recently started trading a live account and frankly, it scares me quite a lot. I've been in constant study of the Forex market since the Spring of 2013 and within that time, I've tested systems of all kinds; systems that others have prospered with. For some reason, whether from ego or from a creative spirit, I had to design my own. I also found that I needed something that could keep me from becoming confused; something that would definitively tell me when I was wrong, how much to risk and what a reasonable profit target would be. I developed some ideas from several places, but the majority of it came from forexalien 's thread. Many thanks to him, dear teacher that he is. I studied his ways for two years and I'm so grateful to him for his generous spirit. His concept of multiple time frame analysis made perfect sense to me but the difficulty is that I have Asperger's and tend to get overly fixated on things. With Alien's systems (and I think they are wonderful), there are a lot of things to look at and I feel that it's too easy for me to focus on one thing while ignoring others. Anyway, I had to try to boil down a few elements and see if I could find a way to do the work of many indicators using only two. Moreover, there had to be little left to interpretation - the fewer "if this then that" scenarios, the better. First, I'll explain the underpinning of the indicators. Next, I will illustrate how best to use them (as far as I could figure out anyway).

--- 帖子 #2 ---
The first element is the indicator I call the "HAC." It's an acronym for "Hurst Average Composite." I learned that one could project profit targets using Hurst averages on tradingfives.com, so I thought I would incorporate that into my analysis, but as always, cycle length is an issue. What length to use? Well I decided that I would have a dynamically-adjusted cycle using John Ehler's formula. I have four moving averages involved here. The base one is the cycle period displaced forward by half its length. The other three are 1/3 the base, 1/2 the base and 2x the base, all projected 1/2 their lengths forward. Again, these are dynamically adjusted according to the current market cycles.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
The next component was to average the four MA's, so this is what that looks like: It seems a little jumpy, but bear with me.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
The next component I call the "RAC," which is an acronym for "RSIOMA Average Composite." This is calculated in much the same way as the HAC, only the calculations are converted into an oscillator. The two work hand-in-hand and confirm one another beautifully. Forexalien loves using the RSIOMA and I learned to love it too. This version responds differently than the original because it's dynamic. Again, it adapts to whatever the current market cycle is. Note that when the RAC makes a cross, the market also crosses the HAC.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The RAC also has another type of cross. Rather than cross its own average, it can cross below 80 or above 20. When it does so, the market will cross the HAC on the very bar that this occurs on. This is actually quite useful during runaway markets because as long as the RAC is above 80 or below 20, the market will not cross the HAC. Observe:

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Ok, now I said that I owe Alien a debt of gratitude to his MTF analysis and I want show you why. In his methods, he waits for wave structures to align themselves. The small TFs will go first, then the larger and so on. "The smaller time periods drives the larger," as he likes to say. Anyway, this is also true of this method. Moreover, the market really has to sometimes shake rattle and roll before it's ready to do something (as you all know far too well). Anyway, this method seems to catch very large moves once the cycles shake themselves out and align. Last week there was a very large move in USDJPY. What I'm going to show you now is what the indicators looked like prior to that move. It began with M15, then H1 and finally H4. I put the cursor on H1 and I have a tool that shows the cursor position on the other two charts (indicated by the orange vertical line).

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Ok. I might as well share my indys, which I should have maybe done in the first post. I had FerruFX program them for me and the code isn't visible, but you understand the underpinnings of it to know what's going on. I also included a cool indy that I found on Steve Hopwood's forum. You can place it on one chart and then control the cursor position of the others using just one chart. It makes it a lot easier to see the relationships between time frames that way.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Ok, I said earlier that profit targets can be calculated as well so I'm going to demonstrate that. It's very simple. What I do, say, for a long, is to take the last swing low to the HAC. I've adjusted my fib tool to show 1x, 2x, 3x, etc... that amount. 3x seems to be the average trade. When calculating PTs, I generally use the middle time frame just to be conservative. In this example it worked very well - nearly to the pip - and then had a sizable retrace.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Now when I move to H4 and perform the same operation - swing low to HAC cross point, the market hit a 4x target to the pip. This is actually a bit unusual, generally speaking, but since the RAC held above 80 the whole time, then I guess one could hope for more than the average.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
There's some other bits of information that can be gleaned from this method as well. Again, the whole thing is predicated on the alignment of cycles. When alignment isn't there, then the trade will not go as expected. In the example below, the market crossed the HAC BEFORE the RAC made a cross. When this occurs, in the majority of cases, the market will retrace before it goes very far and then get in proper alignment before making its move. Below, on the yellow line is where the RAC made its cross. Notice that the market had pulled away from the HAC for some distance before the RAC jumped in. Then it retraced all the way back to the beginning.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
this might be the best so far

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I always seem to be missing trades so this method helps a bit with that. For instance, if there is an H4 or H1 trade running and it is yet some distance to a 3x level, then I can ratchet down to the lower time frames like the M15,M5 &amp; M1 trio and wait for setups there. I guess you could say that there's some context established with this method in that way.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Another fine point is that the profit target projections don't work well using daily, or higher time frames. I wish they did! However, the HAC &amp; RAC work beautifully on them. These will align themselves with the H4 and below prior to great moves. This is especially true when the market goes sideways for a long time. What's happening is that all the HAC lines get into the same general area and then the move happens. What you'll often see is the HAC on a lower time frame racing way ahead of the HAC on a higher one. The higher one will have to catch up first before the move happens. You will see this during prolonged topping/bottoming formations after a large, fast move has occurred.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Well that's all for now. Guys, I just wanted to see if you saw what I saw with this. I mean, maybe I'm hallucinating or something, I don't know. There just seems to be something here, but I would like other points of view from more experienced people. Many thanks and Good night. Almuten

Well we have a tough crowd here, so we'll see.

You forgot to provide the "CyclePeriod.ex4" indicator. It is called by both RAC and HAC ...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
what build are you using?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Ok. Do these work for anybody? Geez!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Ah right! I can't believe I forgot that. I'm so sorry everybody! See if this helps.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thank you Almuten, Its working now. Regards, Roy

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thanx Almuten, everything is fine now

--- 帖子 #27 ---
You're welcome. And thanks FerruFX!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Great! Global_Crosshairs.mq4 is especially useful. I`ve been using an old script (@ sx BT get.ex4) for the same purpose but this one is way more practical. Special thx to FerruFX!

I`m seeing things at first glance too. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I like that quote!

Some more finer points: 1. Both the HAC &amp; RAC have a multiplier adjustment. What this does is lengthen or shorten the base cycle period length. On my charts I like to put on a 1/4 cycle period (0.25) of the HAC because it mimics the next lower time frame HAC on full cycle. I do this because 95% of the time the lower time frame will trigger first , or should trigger first. It's just easier to see at a glance this way. Recall Alien's words: "The lower leads the higher." In the chart below, the shorter length is in green and the regular is in red.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
2. You probably noticed that I have an extra line on the RAC above. What this is, is a 2 period RSI of the RAC itself. It's a lot easier to see if it's about to cross or not. Generally, during a really great trend, it will stay plastered to 100 or 0 until the trend begins to weaken.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
3. Pullbacks can be found and traded on reliably when the RAC is above 80 or below 20. Below is an ideal example. The RSI of the RAC pops the other way and the market bounces off of either the green or red HAC line. Strongest trends will stop at the green during a pullback. Then the RSI slams back to where it was before. Again, this is most reliable when the RAC is above 80 or below 20

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Almuten, One dumb question- RSI is applied to close or First indicator's data? Thanks. Roy

--- 帖子 #35 ---
hi, can you post your template plz

--- 帖子 #36 ---
4. The VERY BEST trades will have a very tight, cascading rhythm to them. It reflects a kind of pent up tension in that once things start to move, there is nobody left to oppose the new direction. As a general guideline, I like to see the next higher HAC line crossed within a set amount of periods. For example, if I'm comparing M1 to M5, I want to see M5 trigger within 10 minutes of M1 being triggered. When comparing M5 to M15, I like to see 8 or fewer and so on. If this happens, a tighter stop can be used. Below is an example of a very weak trade. M1 triggered a HAC cross and M5 did not trigger until 38 minutes later. Money could have been made, but not much. The first red vertical line is where M1 triggered. The second is where M5 triggered.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Sure. I'll put it up top, along with the heiken ashi I use. Actually it's Synergy ABP with auto-width.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi guys same for me...nothing happenned on Standard Alpari demo Edit: With Cycle period...it works

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Not a dumb question. It's placed on "First Indicator Data."

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Did you download the "cycleperiod.ex4?" We discovered I forgot to include that. It's what finds the cycle length. Anyway, I put it with the other indys.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks again. Roy

--- 帖子 #42 ---
By the way Thanks for the tpl...look better now What are the 2 red lines for...Probably just 2 lost lines... Now l will try to understand your system thx

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Oh boy....not enough sleep I guess. I forgot to delete them. I'll replace that template! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
You're welcome! That was obvious for me (for obvious reason) ... but as the additional indicator hasn't to be applied on chart, it is easy to forget about it! Keep up the great work you are doing here ...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks Ferru. I appreciate that coming from you.

Thank you.

Ok, here's a trade that's setting up right now on AUDUSD. First, it has hit a 3:1 profit target on H4, so it's good to start thinking about looking for a trade once this occurs. M1 through H1 have been active for some time and H4 has only triggered recently. There could be some problems with it in the form of a choppy market and I will show you why. The RAC has made a cross below 80 while the price action was still in the HAC so this part is good. Moreover, the shorter, green HAC line was above the red, which shows nice alignment.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Now I have switched the fibs from showing the trade that has just passed to the one setting up now. As it happens, the 3:1 level to the short side ends up just below the swing low on the D1 chart. This is a pretty sensible, normal expectation too.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Ok, now when I compare the place where H4 made its cross to where H1 made its cross, there are about 11 hours difference. This is acceptable, but it could indicate some chop before a big surge down. Generally, if a big move is going to happen, H4 will trigger within 4-8 bars. Plus there's another reason to think it could get a bit choppy. The heiken-ashi bar wasn't touching the HAC when the RAC dropped below 80 on H4. It's close, but precision is actually pretty important and needs to be attended to and accommodated.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Now this is where, in situations like this, I like to go down to the next lower setup to see how "clean" it was. If the H1 and M15 relationship was tight, then it might be better to use an H1 profit target and be more conservative. When H1 made its cross, M15 had done so 17 bars earlier, so that too is a little dubious and we have to accommodate for chop when that happens. Mustn't make the stop too tight.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Going back further, let's look at the M15-M5 relationship. Here we have a great example of how important patient and attention to accuracy is. On the M15 chart there is a HAC cross a few bars after M5 made a HAC cross BUT the RAC did not confirm on M15 because it had not gone below 80 yet. This is why the market came back and made a higher high, stopping out the premature. The second cross however was proper and it occurred within 3 periods.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Moving down still further, the M5-M1 relationship was tight as well. Within a few minutes M5 triggered after M1. Overall, this trade looks pretty clean and should do well, even on H4.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Here's another example of the RSI pullback setup that's in conjunction with this trade that we can see on D1. The market went into the HAC area while the RAC is buried &lt; 20 and the RSI popped up. It's now heading back down. It kind of adds another confirmation to an already good-looking trade.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
2 important current observations Earlier I said something about HAC lines on larger TFs needing to catch up to ones on the shorter TFs. What I have here is an example of GBPUSD. It had a hard short run recently and is now consolidating. Anyway, I think this is a good example of why one should wait....wait....wait... until things align themselves. I know a lot of people are tempted to just buy at certain levels for no reason - round numbers, fib levels or what have you. But there's no point to that if you know it simply isn't time. This method will NOT miss good moves. 1. What I did in this example was show the relationship between the longer HAC (red) on H4 in relation to the shorter HAC (green) on D1. On the D1 chart there is an orange cross. This is where the red HAC on H4 is. They are over 300 pips apart from one another. In normal market conditions, they are generally at least in the same area. Abnormal markets like this will cause extended consolidation. 2. There is an H4 signal that happened on Jan 22, but so far it has only hit a 2x profit target. It actually bounced off it several times, which shows there's something going on. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, it often means a very hard continuation - very fast and often, very sustained. This happens a lot when the 3x target isn't reached. I'm not saying it will happen THIS time (I couldn't know that), but this is the sort of situation that makes it more probable.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Here's another good example of what will happen when alignment starts to occur. In the GBPUSD example, I showed the spread between the higher TF green and the lower TF red. Well now they are getting aligned. I would expect the pound to break one way or the other quite soon. It ought to begin forming swings that can be more easily traded. I put the cursor on the red H4. Notice its correlation with the green on D1. This is important. These two haven't met in a long while, so when they do it will be significant.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I thought now might be a good time to say a few things. First, I've been working on this for quite a long time and I wasn't sure how to start illustrating it. It's almost second nature to me now so I apologize if I'm not clear. Please ask any question you want or even for me to look at any market you're working on now. Actually, I think it would help me quite a lot if you did. I'll do my best to help. Second, just because there are only two indicators doesn't mean it's without technique or skill. There is technique, but it has fewer things to look at. Those few things require more focus is all. I'm a terrible multi-tasker and have a hard time focusing on more than a couple of things at one time - and if I'm forced to, those two things had better be related to each other. Otherwise I'll feel uncertain about what I'm doing. Third, everything in this method is designed to adhere to a single value system: Making money. With everything I did, I kept this in mind. Because I have Asperger's, my mind gets overwhelmed and because I'm given to analysis anyway, the more indys that are on the chart, the more likely I'll scare myself and see things that aren't there. I see "cool" things in every indicator constantly. Drives me nuts! Anyway, then I forget why I'm doing this because I'm way too busy enjoying all the cool things the indys are doing. Now, some price action purists out there might be saying "Well indicators are lagging, so why not just focus on PA?" While I understand your viewpoint and have espoused it myself at one time, here's what I say to that: Price alone does not cooperate with what I want to do. Sometimes it jacks around forever, faking this way and then that. For me, there's too much to look at and be confused by. Too many questions that take too much time to find an answer for and even then I'm never sure. I certainly can't relax and chill out about it. Price action has way too many "if this then that" scenarios for me. What I'm really hunting for are what I like to call "Statistical Events." It's different than statistics because all indicators generate statistics in the form of facts. Statistical events differ in that I'm looking for the unlikely. It's the unlikely that moves markets into large moves, not what people generally see.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
So far, so good on the AUDUSD trade. Only the M5 &amp; M1 went above the red lines and even then they re-penetrated them.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
What's happening now with the USDJPY is kind of cool. It might turn out to be a great trade. It's not what I typically look for, but it's happening now so why not? 1. Notice H4 on the far right. The RAC is well above 80 and the RSI of it is indicating a PB and then a resumption of a long. 2. The next chart over, on H1, notice that when the HAC was crossed to the downside, the RAC did not break the 80 level until six bars later. As in previous examples, this indicates that it will return at least to where the HAC was at the time of the cross. 3. M15, M5, and M1 are coiled and ready for a ride north.They are all "in position," so to speak.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
This is a very interesting thread. I will surely be watching this further. I will start this on demo once I fully understand it from some more example live trades, like you are posting now. Thanks for the thread!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks for opening the thread. Watching with a great deal of interest and do get an imbalance between time frames is a great way to trade. Cheers gavin

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Very interesting. Thanks.

AUDUSD Update: Well, this happens now and then, but it appears that the Aussie is headed back north. H4 has yet to confirm, but all the other TFs had nice tight reversals - much better than the short side did. This is a case where, rather than allow your stoploss to be hit, it's better to either switch direction or exit. Oh...that reminds me. I never talked about stops. I just put them at the swing high or low. At least that's how I calculate my risk percentage. But that doesn't mean I intend to lose that much when losses come.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
USDJPY Update: This hasn't turned long yet. It tried to last night, but I'm highlighting on M15, it was like it was chasing the HAC line, trying to cross. It was saying "Not yet! Not yet! I'm not perfect yet!" On H4, I circled where it's likely headed first. But once there, again, we'll have to wait for the setup. I don't like this pair right now though. It has the behavior of an extended triangle or other complex pattern in the making. That doesn't mean there won't be trades that set up on smaller TFs, but where H4 is concerned, it might be best to be conservative.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
GBPUSD Update Ok, as expected, this took off nicely. Now here is something that happens once in awhile. There are actually two active trades to the long side in operation on this pair right now. I've drawn a new set of targets on the last H4 signal. It's near a 2x level on H4 and on H1, as the HAC line on both TFs were in the same place. That's kind of unusual. Anyway, both RAC lines are also above 80 with their RSI's at or near 100. So far, so good. But watch the 1x &amp; 2x levels because a lot of times retracements happen in these places. If they do, then you can ratchet down to M15 and wait for an M15, M5, &amp; M1 setup for a 3x target on the larger TF. A lot of times, if a retracement setup like that happens, the PT on, say, M15 will be very close to the PT on the larger TF, or right on it.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
You're welcome. I appreciate others looking at this with me.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
You're welcome. Please ask questions when you have them. I'm sure they'll come

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I have to go for a bit...have to take my dog to the vet. Anyway, keep an eye on USDJPY. It has hit the H4 HAC line and the RSI bounce setup is still active. But watch M15 to M1 for the setup. Be realistic and patient with it. Remember that the HAC line on the larger smaller time frame ought to be close enough to be crossed by the next larger time frame within an acceptable number of periods. I like to have at least 3 consecutive TFs align before pulling the trigger.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Ok..guess that didn't take long. Anyway, I just saw something on the GBPUSD trade. Below is an RSI/RAC bounce setup on D1. Notice that the 3x target I projected from H4 is right on the HAC on D1. I would think it's reasonable to believe it will reach this level and then reverse. But as always, wait...wait...wait for alignment! In most situations markets have to futz around for a bit before reversing. But it might be ok to use the lower TFs to set up a short once the 1.465 level is reached (or thereabouts).

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I'm going to talk a little bit about how to view when a trade setup is 100% invalidated and how multiple trade setups might happen within a consolidation pattern. A trade is 100% invalidated when: 1. The prior swing high (for shorts) is taken out prior to the HAC crossing. 2. The prior swing low (for longs) is taken out prior to the HAC crossing. DO NOT hold on in hope if the trade is invalidated. A failed trade setup is the best reason to switch your bias. The reason I designed this method was to know, without any doubt, when I was wrong. Being certain when wrong is almost as important as being certain when correct. In the GBPUSD situation, prior to the breakout to the upside, there were both long and short setups involved. The one that will win however is the one with the tightest setups. A tight setup is the most unlikely event to occur, yet it must occur prior to any large move. The tighter and cleaner it is, the more unlikely it is. It represents a kind of equilibrium point that has been reached. Such points are rare in the context of total market movement. Moreover, as you all know, markets tend to move away from equilibrium. If you go back and look at every time there was an H4 cross of the HAC line and then compare how tight it was compared to the lower TFs, you'll see that the long side was the best. Also, bear in mind that the trade triggered on Jan 22nd was still active. In the chart below I put on the profit targets of both active trades. The green lines are the PT levels from the 1/22 trade and the blue lines are from the most recent. The market has hit the PT on the first trade and has really reacted to it so I would expect some consolidation and then maybe an M15-M1 setup to make a run at the 3x target on trade #2, which also coincides with the HAC on D1. This is actually a more difficult scenario compared to most, but since it's happening now I'm using it as an example.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
USDJPY Update: Ok, this is something to pay attention to. Recall that not long ago I said to look for a bounce from the H4 HAC. The market did not bounce up and no setups were there on M15. M5 &amp; M1 barely did anything on their own either. But take note that the HAC on H4 has been crossed. Also take note that the RAC on H4 is nowhere near crossing below 80. This is the purpose of the RAC. It shows when a trade in the opposite direction is worth taking (with a probability of success). This kind of activity however DOES point to a future consolidation pattern that will form. It's best to leave this pair alone for awhile. The RSI bounce setup is still active, but it will be some time before the lower time frames align themselves into a respectable trade. The HAC lines on those are still very far apart (see yellow arrows on lower TFs), so it's best to let them get a bit closer together first.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
AUDUSD Update: Recall that when I pointed out a trade to the short side, I also pointed out it would be choppy because the setup wasn't tight. When H4 triggered there were 11 hours difference between H4 and H1, which is a long time. However, to the long side, there were only a few hours so it's likely going to take out the prior swing high. The relation between H1 &amp; M15 is also very tight, as were the relations between M15 &amp; M5 and M5 to M1. If one was short, then it would be wise to exit prior to allowing a stoploss to be hit. There's just no sense it in. Also, if it looks like a setup from M15-M1 is setting up in the opposite direction (which it did in this case), and you have the time to watch it, then play it. Play it until the M5 HAC is crossed or something. That's ok to do, even though the longer TF trade is going the other way. At least you'll get something out of it if the longer TF doesn't work out.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
AUDUSD - Further update: Ok, in my haste to teach this, I forgot to see if there were any active H4 trades to the long side still in play (ones that haven't reached the 3x profit area) and there were two that were triggered on Jan 19th and another on Jan 20th. These were nice, clean setups. Also, you can see that it's been bouncing around both sets of PT lines on the way up. Anyway, it ought to hit the 3x level and might push past it to the 3x level on the most recent active trade. Most times, there aren't this many active trades going on and things are simpler. Anyway, the "Pink" trade hit its PT a couple of times and then retraced to a "green" PT line from the trade that was triggered before it. That's why it's still going up now. The last trade, the "orange" one, has a 2x line in the same place as the 3x line on the 'green' trade, so I would look for a retrace from this area and maybe even a short on a set of lower TFs (but again, waiting for alignment first). This is one of the trickiest parts with this. Remembering to keep the overall context in mind and play the probabilities.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I wanted to talk about profit targets and why I put them where I do. For starters, they appear to work well But there's another reason. Logically, prior to any move, there's going to be a group of people who are on the correct side. This group will want to take profits at some point. For the winning side, there is going to be a place where it's generally agreed upon where they are wrong. They will put up a certain amount of risk capital accordingly. Most often, it's at a prior swing high or low. That's why the measurement line begins there. Now the equilibrium point, the point where all the TFs get together and say the same thing, is the line between the folks making money and those losing it. This is why the line ends here. The space in between is the "collective risk." Collectively then, they will also begin to take profits and secure gains in typical human ways. 1:1 (for the most timid), 2:1 (for the conservative) and 3:1 (for the real pros). Think of these as the "collective reward." Once all the reward is collected, what is left to do?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
GBPUSD Update: Ok, I put on a D1 chart to show it has now hit all the PT levels on all active long trades that triggered on H4. It is now at the HAC line on D1. Mission accomplished. Also, the RSI is popped to the top while the RAC is buried. Next, we'll have to see what it does. After such a move it will take some time for it to figure out what to do. All the short TFs need to have their HAC lines get a little closer together, etc.. before a short is triggered. If this doesn't happen, then I would bet that it will gear up for another long. But again, this will take time.

AUDUSD Update: The Aussie has hit all the 3x PT levels save one. Judging by the way it acted when the other trades closed out, I would say this last group of traders are holding on to 3x. Also, the HAC lines on the lower TFs are pretty far apart and don't appear to be lining up in any way. Also, on the D1, the RAC has popped above 20 while price is still within the HAC area. This could mean some much higher prices to come. But like always...wait...wait...wait.

USDJPY - Continuation short to Long setup (hopefully) Below is something happening on USDJPY. Note that M15 RAC is buried and its RSI popped to the top. At the same time, an M5 trade, backed up by a nice M1 signal, has reached a 1x profit target, which is on the green HAC on M15. The 2x target for M5 is on the red HAC on M15. Now, given the nature of the UJ today I'd be reluctant to short this but if it works out, it will pull the M15 HAC down closer to the bottom, which could set up for a nice long trade back to the H4 or H1 HAC line. It's something to watch.

Hi Almuten As far as l understand, this strategy is mainly about crosses from RAC, RSI(2) window's...Am l right? Can you show some trades example with entries and exits...and the correlation between TF and all indicator together... A step by step kind of trade plan should be great to help me figure out the full potential of this Thanks

Hi Ben. It's really about the HAC (red line on the chart) and the market's relationship to it that's most important. The oscillator, or RAC, merely confirms whether or not a crossing of the HAC was merely market noise or if there was some statistical importance to it. The 'unlikely event' that I'm looking for is the crossing of the red line from one time frame to another. First the M1, then M5, M15, etc... in rapid succession, along with a perfect RAC confirmation from each one. I'll find some past examples and post them. Thanks for the question!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I have a feeling I might have gotten ahead of myself so I'm going to go over the fundamentals again to make sure I haven't confused anyone. Some of this is surprisingly precise in certain areas and it bears repeating. The relationship between the HAC and the price is to determine when a change in trend is happening on that particular time frame. This is indicated by price crossing the HAC line. I use Heiken-ashi candles because it's easier to see this. Plus it allows for a bit of "slop." When the market crosses the HAC line, I also want the RAC to make a cross as well. This can happen in two ways: 1. crossing its own average 2. crossing below 80 3. crossing above 20 *** If the RAC crosses its own average while above 80 or below 20, then do NOT consider that as a cross. While in these zones, the RAC crossing its own average has no relationship to the HAC. In fact, you'll see that if the RAC crosses its own average while in these zones, the market will not cross the HAC. It will still indicate a (usually small) change of direction, but it will not have the significance (generally speaking) necessary for a great trade. If the market crosses the HAC, it has no significance unless the RAC has made one of it's crosses as well (again, in one of the three ways mentioned earlier). A PERFECT CROSS has these elements: 1. The direction of the HA candle is up if the cross is up or orange/red if it is down 2. The candle is touching the HAC line 3. The RAC has either separated from it's average (the sharper the better) or has crossed down from 80 (for shorts) or up through 20 (for longs)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
In my last example, it's obvious that this alone is not going to make a lot of money. That's why I use other TFs to find the real trend change. The smaller TFs will exhibit the same characteristics and give some warning that it's about to happen on the larger as well. The two good H1 crosses that didn't produce any money also had terrible lower TF support. I highlighted those and circled them. The M15 on those crosses either had way too many bars between its cross and H1, or a bad cross in the form of the HA candle not touching the HAC. Quality is important.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I think what I'm going to do now is let other people ask specific questions and lead the conversation. That way I'll know if what I said so far is clear and allow people to play around with it for awhile. You've already seen some of the things I can get into with this, like: 1. Bad crosses and what they mean 2. Profit targets 3. Getting into running markets 4. Anticipating consolidation patterns

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I couldn't resist putting this one up. Recall yesterday that the AUDUSD had a ways to go to hit a 3x target? Well M15 had the RSI slam down while the RAC was at the ceiling. Then M5 &amp; M1 gave a picture perfect HAC &amp; RAC cross. Anyway, I thought it was neat. It didn't quite make it to the pip yet, but it looks likely it will.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
AUDUSD - Thoughts.... As I think about this pair and what it's done over the past two weeks using this method, I find it unusual. I mean, three H4 trades, all hitting their 3x targets, all at different levels. On top of that, the D1 has had a HAC &amp; RAC cross while all this is going on. Now, I don't have a lot of experience analyzing this sort of thing (because it doesn't happen that often), but to my mind, it's almost like it's a very deliberate staging/buying campaign for a larger move. Maybe some of you out there, using your own methods, will determine the same thing. I really think this area will prove interesting. Btw, the final 3x has been hit

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Good stuff Almutan, clean non cluttered charts, nice. One question though, those lines, 0, 1.1, 2.1 etc, I get the feeling they are not fibs but profit targets, is it part of an available indicator

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Kmw, Yeah, I'm easily confused so I like to make do with fewer things. As for the PT levels, I reset the defaults for my fibs and adjusted the labels to say 1:1, 2:1, etc... At heart, I'm a fib man myself so it was a decision to reset the defaults on them. But there is a fib expansion tool as well so there's really two tools that can be adjusted. One can be left for using fibs.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Bad Crosses I found a great, recent example of bad crosses to take a look at. It really illustrates the importance of the RAC as a confirmation tool, especially when above 80 or below 20. This doesn't even factor in lower timeframes to make a determination.

Nicely done my man! Actually, I love those GBPAUD/NZD pairs. They're wild right now, eh? Anyway, you could, given the really volatile nature and number of pips, set yourself in the most probable direction, like going with the M15 or H1 and then wait for the M5 &amp; M1 to form their setups. [edit] But let's look at the PT levels for M5. I think you'll see you did the right thing. It went a bit further to a 4x level (or very close) but this is unusual. I'd say your instincts are pretty darn good

--- 帖子 #90 ---
After that last explanation I feel I understand much better, when I have time after work I will try to set it up and test for myself. Looking good.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I'm glad that was helpful

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Since Kmw is watching the GBPAUD pair, I thought I'd offer some perspective on it. First of all, both the GBPAUD &amp; NZD pairs have been in a lot of consolidation and corrective moves for the last couple months, so naturally one would expect indecisive action and so on. Heavily trending markets will be much cleaner in the setups and make money quicker and with less risk. Second, there are so many pips in those markets, who can resist?! Ok, so let me show you what this method is showing on H4 &amp; H1 now. In the pic below, I have two charts. The H1 &amp; H4. On the H4, on the bottom, is a 3x PT area from a valid trade setup made on Dec 15th. Last week's low nearly hit it to the pip. This is a good argument for that low holding for awhile. Shortly afterward, there was a valid H4 trade setup. In this one, the RAC went above 20 just as the market penetrated the HAC. So far, so good. However, when H1 penetrated the HAC with a valid setup, it was 14 bars (hours) earlier. Like I've said before, this will indicate choppiness and indecisive action, which is totally in keeping with the overall market structure. The fact that H1 hung around the HAC line before taking off is helpful though. Generally however, it's best if both components - the HAC &amp; RAC, happen within a few periods of each time frame. Ok, Now on the H1 chart, I marked the long setup in yellow. Note that it hit it's 2x PT and then triggered a valid sell. I've marked those PT levels in pink. However, the H4 trade to the long side is still active. The 3x on H1 is still above the low of last week, so it's possible that it will both meet that profit target AND continue on to flesh out the active H4 trade AND also fulfill the H1 trade that has yet to be invalidated. Now, you might think that because the H4 price is now below the HAC that this is an H4 short. It is not. The RAC did not cross while the market was in contact with the HAC. Historically, when this occurs, the market tends to be sucked right back into the HAC. This is a really, really complex situation and like all correcting/consolidating markets, is difficult to trade. Even so, it's not impossible.

Actually I'm liking your insights, that fake out above, your latest post, reading about your observations re HAC, RAC. gonna keep reading, but not now, sleepy time here , seeyas all tomorrow, gained a few more but out of the markets now

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Well after I applied your template, which works beautifully, I wanted to get familiar with it and got carried away by 20/80 crossings. If there is a strong cross from 20/80 after RAC being up/down there for a while, then entering on HAC cross seems to yield good results. I am not saying that it will work, or that it is better, just that it jumped at me so hard that I need to investigate it Also, what pairs are you watching? Having multiple time frames, I am not sure how to watch it properly, maybe on H4 and then simply confirming on H1 and M15 it is doable. Which timeframes and pair do you recommend?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi Plague, Actually this is a very good observation you've made. This is very true indeed. But if you do trade in this way, you will find that the best setups will have lower TF support. They, too, will have generated signals shortly before...unless you're trading M1 of course As for the pairs, I'm actively watching GBPUSD, AUDUSD, GBPJPY, USDJPY. I'm a little skiddish with the GBPAUD/NZD pairs, but I'm watching them anyway. Those are very challenging right now. As to how to watch them, this is what I recommend: 1. Find the context using H4. Are there any active trades that are still valid and haven't hit their 3x profit targets? This is good to know. Most of the time something will be active in some way and there might be a continuation trade setup on a lower TF. 2. Watch the setups on H1 &amp; H4. When they happen, check M15 to see how 'clean' it was or if even a valid setup occurred. 3. If you want, take the extra step of checking M15's relation to M5 for cleanliness and the same for M5 to M1. Now, all of that could be done well in advance of an H1 or H4 trade being triggered. You've got plenty of time to see it begin to set up and analyze how choppy it's likely to be and therefore, how loose your stop will have to be. Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks, I will look into H4-based method too. As a sidenote, I find NZDUSD to be pretty technical, maybe it will work too because of that?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi Almuten More l tried to work with your template...still have technical issues...am l alone?? l though Apari MT4 was the problem then l installed it to OANDA same thing... 1) when changing TF...enormous lag...My computer is brand new...Not the cause... 2) when l right click on chart...cross is coming by default like a personal customization from you...Have to left click to remove it...Didn't find yet how to reverse that setting... 3) when l try to look back to study...l find on the way horizontal and vertical lines named crosshair lines...What for? 4) if l try to put just crosshair indi to a new chart trying to see what it does nothing happen l thing something is wrong somewhere into tpl causing the lag...or maybie it is related to your customization... Just wondering Thanks Forgot 1 more if l click on lines to delete it as usual nothing happenned...have to go through objet list box to remove it

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi Ben, Ok, what's happening could be coming from two different problems: 1. The Global Crosshair indicator. It's a bit cumbersome, but you don't need it. I just find it useful for backtesting, etc.. and getting to know the relationships between one TF and another. It you hit "Cntrl + i", the indy list will come up and you can either remove it or adjust it to completely turn off. Whenever you apply the template to a chart, it will be turned on though. The purpose of it is when you have multiple charts open, you can position the crosshairs on all of them by moving around on just one. 2. The calculations are a bit resource intense. I might see if FerruFX can shorten the calculation length, like limit the number of bars the calcs are done on and see if that can still maintain the integrity of the method as it was designed. If you have a lot of bars set up on your charts, the indys will take up a lot of CPU power. It's kind of one of the drawbacks, I'm afraid. I have an Intel 5820k processor with 32 gigs of ram and it lags a bit for me as well. I even overclocked it by 800mhz. Let me know if this helps at all though.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hey Almuten, first of all I want to thank you for sharing this system. Before I get deeper in a system I would like to understand more about the indicators which are used. May I ask you to provide me a link or even a pdf-file with John Ehler's formula and his explanations? I already tried to google it but unfortunately I couldn't find any information. Best regards !!!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I'll look into that pair too. I haven't tested it out on that one, but like all pairs, it will have little quirks, I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi, you said that you have second HAC lines (green one). And it's multiplier on yout template is 0.382 , not 0.25 as you said. What should we actually use? Or it doesn't matter?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Ah... I'm glad you brought that up. 0.25 is what I originally said because when I first started doing this, that's what I did. Then I found that sometimes .25 shortened the cycle length too much and made the HAC behave strangely. It just got too short. However, putting it at .382 (being a fib man), accomplished what was needed. I'm going to see if I can amend or edit my original statement. Thanks for bringing that up!

you're welcome))) well, ok, now i see

--- 帖子 #105 ---
First of all wanted to thank you!! Now, since I am in a long on NU, I am seeing that it reached a 4:1 PT on the H1 and H4, retraced some and is now going back up (HAC crosses on smaller TF), maybe just touching again and then a big retrace? On the other hand, looking at the daily, it crossed where I have now my SL (up over 200p) and the 1:1 is still over 230P away. Take profit and then wait for a continuation on D1? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Go5, First of all, congrats on the nice trade! There's no way you can lose money on it now, so relax, right? Anyway, you did a good job analyzing this. H1 did in fact hit its 4:1 and shot past it a bit. D1 is in a great position too, but look at H4. See how it hit its 2:1 and backed off? That's telling me something. It's telling me that people are taking profits there. Not everybody, but some. If you have a split position, you might consider that too. Nothing would be wrong with that. So, what can we expect now? Would we expect an outright reversal of the whole shebang right here? Likely not. Sure, on M15-M1, there will be some short moves here and there, but the H1 and H4 are looking very strong still. The RAC on both is way above 80 and even the RSI on them is positive. However, trades can trigger to the short side on the lower TFs, which can lead to the larger ones being sucked in. The HAC on H1 is close enough to be involved, so it's something to watch for. Obviously, you don't want to lose what you have now though, so that's in your mind too. What to do? You know, there's every reason to believe H4 will hit its 3x target. However, there's also reason to believe that on its way to do so, it can slam back into the 1x line or in that area on its way to the target Can you deal with that? This is a question I can't answer for you. It's a lot of pips, after all. Currently, a perfect M15-M1 trade was triggered to the long side. Let's watch it and see if the M15 makes its 3x target. If it does, it will be past the 2:1 line on H4, giving us confidence that it will go higher and likely, that 2x line will become support, which will allow you to raise your SL further. If it does not make it however, and stops at the H4 2x line, then we really have to keep an eye on it closely and expect a deeper retracement. To be continued...

This is the first I've heard of it!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
GBPUSD - Short setup Ok, now we were interested in seeing what occurred after GBPUSD hit the 3x target. After some futzing around, and after some sloppy action, this pair finally set up for a short. M15-M1 is already in progress. H1 is near to crossing right now. A conservative target is the 3x on M15, which is exactly at the 1x line on the last H4 trade, right at the last consolidation area. This is a reasonable target on a couple of fronts. The M15 trigger was a bit sloppy though and it would have been easy to miss and I'm not sure I would've taken it anyway. That's just going to happen. Anyway, if the 3x target on H1 is hit, it will take out the prior low on D1. The H1 trade portion of this will probably be a little sloppy on the way down. M15-M1 segment was fine, but by the time the H1 was triggered, it had been many bars between the M15 trigger and H1. So expect a reaction. If the risk is too great, etc... it will likely come and you can reenter on another M15-M1 setup.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thanks for your insight! Can't split my microlot....adjusted my sl to the lower side of the kumo on the H1, we 'll see. Dropped under the pitchfork during the news though

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Yeah, see how it just bounced right off of the 2x line again? But be patient and wait for an M15-M1 setup to go long again. This is just an observation, but the 2x on the last M15 trade was right at the 2x on the H4. Price is still holding above the 1x on H4 though. H1 is crossing below the HAC, BUT the RAC has not crossed 80 so we're still good on that front. The RSI on H4 is still plastered against the ceiling as well. The HAC on M5 is still a good distance from M1, so the long won't set up until they get a bit closer together. Be patient.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
AUDUSD Update: Ok, after this pair hit the 3x target it set up for a short on M15 and then on H1. The 3x on H1 is marked on the H4 chart, which is very close to the lows on D1. There were many bars between the M15 setup and the H1 however. Once again, expect some counter trend reactions on the way down. It's likely not going straight there. It might do something strange like that, but it's not likely. Now, if you also think about what this means in the context of D1, consider what a double-bottom looks like. They're pretty ragged, right? Seldom are they smooth and easy-looking.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
GBPAUD Update: Ok, a nice series of trades just triggered on this pair. Anyway, like we said yesterday, there were active long trades that had yet to be invalidated on H1 &amp; H4 both. Then a valid H1 short set up and stopped at its 2x target (The H1 chart with pink lines). Also, on the W1 chart, it shows the market resting against the HAC line with no RAC crossing (well above 80), indicating that it's a support and not a trade setup on that TF. If this pair makes yet another H4 trade setup by the end of the day, then I would say we'll have a very interesting week next week.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I wanted to say something more about the M15-M1 setup, especially in light of Go5's long trade in progress right now. It's been on my mind all morning. Heck, that was a week's worth of pips for some people. Anyway, when these kinds of setups occur, it is perfectly fine to take a position in the opposite way of the main H4 trade. Generally, this setup will materialize into a sizable correction, or maybe even a total reversal of the whole H4 trade. Once again, this method looks for the UNLIKELY. When an unlikely event happens, it means that people are getting surprised. In this case, we weren't completely surprised because we had an H4 2x level to watch. It proved itself earlier as a profit-taking level for some of the traders. Then, to see the M15-M1 setup to occur, well, it says something doesn't it? Will the M15 hits its PT level? I don't know. However, what I DO know (as well as I am able as a human being), is that it won't reverse back to the long side UNTIL at least the M5 &amp; M1 align enough to produce a resumption of the trend upward. Until that gets even close, there's no point of thinking of going long again. There just isn't. A major clue lies in the RSI of the RAC on those TFs. If you put the cursor on M15, you'll see that all 3 triggered within that bar. First the M1, then M5 and then M15. The 3x PT level of M15 was around 110 pips away at the time of the valid cross, which makes it pretty worthy of consideration, right?

GBPAUD - Potential trade invalidation Wanted to point out something on this pair right now. Yesterday we were watching an H1 short trade and I pointed out that it hit its 2x level (pink lines) and began to go upward. Watch what occurs if that trade becomes invalidated. It will be at the 2.0564 level. If that happens, a lot of losses will be taken and stops triggered. Remember, there were multiple TFs involved on this level, an "unlikely event." With that level out of the way, there's no stopping this market. There are no current, active short trades other than that one going on right now. Moreover, it also appears that H4 will be making yet another active long trade within an acceptable number of periods. Looks like it will be clean as well.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Well I'm not too worried about adding indys to validate other ones or to filter them in any way. The method is pretty straightforward in that it does its own confirming (if done properly). There's a lot more "simplified sophistication" going on in those indicators than any 10 things MT4 ships with. Some of the PT analysis can get complex and one might get lost in it, and that part does take getting used to. I'll admit that. But here's how I see it. If a person has to wait around for a trade to set up (and he will), then he might as well see what other trades are happening in those markets and give himself some overall context - meaningful context - in light of the overall method. Now don't have a cow but I AM going to add a couple of things to help get a person into a running market, etc... But I don't want to confuse anybody or throw new things into it yet. When people start finding things on their own and posting them, asking good questions and so on, then I'll know I can do that.

Almuten - Great thread ! question- How do you use the Global crosshairs, indi Not sure its working on my chart correctly. Really enjoying your insights with this approach.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Well what do you mean then? Maybe I misunderstood something. If so, I apologize.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Well the template has it set up already. But how it works is that if you have a chart open with the GH on it and then you open another chart, say, of a lower time frame or even another currency pair, the chart with the GH on it, and you move the cursor, the other chart will have an orange set of crosshairs moving on it. So it takes at least two charts to be open to see how it works. With this method I found it useful to see correlations from a setup on say, an M1 chart to one on M5, M15, etc... Let me know if this doesn't make sense.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
RAC - finer points I wanted to say a few things about the RAC because while it's a confirmation oscillator, it also says something about the bias of the market, as well as whether or not the market is operating cyclically or in a trending mode. Bear in mind that this oscillator utilizes a cyclical component and fractions and multiples of cycles. Those are converted into displaced moving averages and a moving average of the RSI (with a period length equal to the main cycle length) of those averages is what makes the oscillator. That's basically how it works. As I said earlier, it's a derivative of the RSIOMA oscillator (which you can look up on the internet). No secrets here. When the RAC is above 80 or below 20 it represents strong (RSI) momentum of all 4 displaced moving averages. In the chart below, you can see how the MAs fan out when the RAC is at an extreme. In this example though, the MAs aren't auto-adjusted dynamically so they won't match the RAC perfectly, but you get the idea.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
RAC - Finer Points Contd... This oscillator is also a BIAS indicator. The 50 line shows whether or not the bias is up or down. If the shorter displaced MAs are above the longer ones, then the RAC will be &gt; 50. If below, then &lt; 50. When the RAC is flat at the 50 line or banging around it first above, then below, this means the the MAs have all collected together, like in the NZDUSD chart below. The market won't move when like this. Knowing this information has a lot to do with the quality of the trade, or the likelihood of it moving quickly. A meandering RAC near the 50 line can be looked at with some extra care. AGAIN, this is in a meandering situation, like in a consolidation pattern, etc... A good cross coming out of 20 is still a great potential long if it meets the other criteria and a cross below 80 is still a great short. If it stalls at 50 however...well be mindful of that. It's best to get a cross from an extreme and then keep on trucking through 50. If it has been meandering near 50 but above it and crosses up, then the probability of the trade working is greater than if it crosses down, etc... These situations are going to happen plenty of times, so it's good to be mindful of. This is just something to, once again, help establish context.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
HAC - Finer points Now that you guys have seen this stuff for a bit, I wanted to get into why I made this indicator the way I did and the reason for some other things. If there's some logic involved, it takes trading from the realm of following indicators blindly like a monkey into something more meaningful. Granted, a monkey could do better than me at this, but...since I have a brain I like to use it. I sometimes forget that I like to use it, but really, I like to use it. Anyway, consider the picture below. What is happening there? There are lots of direction changes, etc... In the midst of the chaos, there's an equilibrium, or tipping point. The HAC line is the average of all of those lines and thus, is the tipping point. Attached Image (click to enlarge) When the market crosses the HAC line, what it's doing is crossing that tipping point. Ah, but what made it? Aggregate Disagreement. There were people who thought one thing and people who thought another. Or, if you're more of a devious turn of mind, it's the place where the brokers and market makers gathered the hapless and prepared them for slaughter prior to taking it in the direction they always knew it would go. At any rate, some goings on &amp; back and forth was happening, whatever the real causes are. The reason I'm telling you that the HAC line on one TF has to catch up to another one prior to a move being made is because until it does, there's no back and forth on that TF at all. It's not even in the neighborhood of the slaughterhouse yet, let alone in it. It has to be present. The more TFs that are in the neighborhood, the greater number of "unlikely" events will be made available. A trade worth taking isn't going to happen with just an M1 setting up. It's such a remote possibility it's not worth consideration. This is also the reason that I strongly advise that there be very few periods from a trigger from one TF to the trigger on the next and so on. Why? Because the fewer periods there are in between, the more participants have gathered into one nice, neat little area. Once the direction proves one way or the other, well, it's like somebody shouting "Fire!" in a crowded movie theater. They'll be trampling each other to get through the doors. I know, I'm being a bit dramatic but it's more fun this way

Thank You ALL I wanted to thank everybody for looking at this with me. I can't begin to tell you how much it has helped to focus me and to help alleviate my fears of trading. Public humiliation is as fearful than losing money for a lot of people (at least me), so this is really good for me. This isn't my first time at the rodeo when it comes to trading though. I did it professionally for five years trading S&amp;P futures. I started out as a financial cripple. Before I got into this I made $15k a year industrial painting and sandblasting. It was a dangerous and grueling job. Naturally I wanted to find a more humane way of making a living, which is why I developed an interest in trading. Besides, I didn't like alcohol enough to keep working the job I was working (it's kind of a necessity after years of doing it). Anyway, I happened to find that the man who invented the stochastics indicator, George Lane, lived in a small farming community not far from me. It felt like fate, so I contacted him and he soon became my mentor. I sat with that man every day from 6:00 am to market close for two years and learned quite a lot from him. (Did you know he was the one in possession of R.N. Elliot's work and gave it to Robert Prechter? Larry Williams also got his %R from him as well.) He also taught classes twice a month and I helped him with those. I found that I had an almost "Rain Man" ability to read price charts and would make accurate market calls constantly. Imagine my joy! Consequently, some of the students offered opportunities to trade for them and, having no real money of my own, I took them up on it. (One guy knew me for three days and gave me a $100k account to trade for him - crazy!) Most of them were pretty well-off and some were very wealthy. I had no other real opportunities for adventure and fortune, so I went with it. I can't begin to tell you the eventual pressure that put me under though. I wasn't ready for it emotionally, but I left George and took the offer of a very wealthy and kind gentleman across country to trade for him. The man actually bought me a 4 bedroom house to live in, which wasn't the first offer of that kind to be made, but I felt better with him than others so I took him up on it. Can you imagine it though? There are people out there like that! So there I was, far from my childhood home in the boonies, vulnerable and untested in the world of trading. Moreover, making or losing what was formerly a year's pay within the span of a few hours was so damned surreal at the time. I was fighting that. Anyway, the freedom and objectivity I first felt when I got into trading left me. No more Rain Man To compensate, I simply worked harder...and I mean much harder, like my life depended on it - which it sort of did. I produced from 45% to 95% returns every year, but I'm telling you it took its toll in ways I can't describe. I was a wreck. All I wanted to do was get out of that situation and get into "normal" again. But here's the thing...and some of you might have experienced this too; going from a world of limitless opportunity to virtual boredom and wage slavery, working for unimaginative, corporate reptiles who wouldn't know a sound risk to take or change to make if it bit them in the balls, is also maddening. Trading, that distant memory, still lingered - helped by the fact that I still spent 4-5 hours a day studying markets. (Hey, it gets in the blood!) So here I am again, after having lost my umpteenth job after saving yet another organization millions of dollars (ungrateful wretches), attempting to trade again. At this point it's clear that there is nothing else I'm suited for. I think the psychological damage is nearly healed and I've forgiven myself for the most part. When I used to trade years ago there was so much anxiety that even now when I do it I associate it somehow, even though the money is in minuscule amounts at present. Well that's my story. I've had a few PMs asking me about myself, etc... so here it is, in public view. Onward and upward!

That's good reading. Me, this is my second go at forex, lost $300 last time trading micro lots which isn't much but when I struggled to turn things around knew I had to stop for a while. This time I'm up around $300 still doing micros looking for consistency in my trading, not quite there yet but it's coming. My day job is also in the painting field, boring and feel like I'm getting to old for it. Just turned 58 a few days ago and really feel I have nothing to show for those years in the trade. Funny where the money goes . Was self employed up to a year ago but never seemed to get anywhere with that, was near bankrupt so quit and went working for another painter which has enabled me to clear most of the depts to the point I only have a few hundred outstanding on the credit card today, and a few more months on the vehicle payments. So close now. Onward and upward indeed but back to the day job on monday again for me, can't stop yet.

Oh brother! Another painter that trades? What are the odds!? Must've been fate my friend. And you actually traded this already once. Painters unite! This year, after losing my job yet again (I think it's the "Asperger's Curse of Employment", or "ACE"), I painted a few houses to earn some money for trading. I still have an airless sprayer and other tools (just in case). Anyway, while doing so, I often pondered my decision to leave the painting trade, whether or not it was worth the anxiety and pain, and would I have been happier overall and so on. I can't really know the answer to that I guess, but I did think about it quite often. I know one thing that was difficult with the whole trading thing. It was getting used to the notion of the possibility of making ridiculous amounts of money so quickly. One has to change his entire concept of value. My father was a painting and sandblasting contractor, so "by the sweat of thy brow" was pretty much what I learned from early on. At this point though (I'm 51 now), I figure it's time for me. I've had about enough of suffering. I've got $500 burning a hole in the pocket of my trading account, so we're in the same boat. If I lose it, I won't be able to replace it very quickly. But you know, I once read something that Richard Dennis said (my old mentor used to have him as a runner in the pits of Chicago), it went something like "I'd put more faith in somebody that started with a small account than someone with millions." The idea being that the smaller account guy would be more attentive and develop better skills. I don't know if that's true, but it makes sense.

TIME: The only thing of real value As I get older I realize more and more that everything has a time value to it. Ever think about that? I do all the time. And what's really funny is that nobody even knows what it is! How crazy is that? We all must be f*cking nuts! Anyway, since my objective with the whole system was to make money, and time being a major factor in that endeavor, I wanted to make the most expeditious use of time that I could. This is why I worked at something that had an immediate result. Waiting for a profit to materialize not only ties up capital, but it's psychologically draining - especially if even a small loss is involved while you wait. God knows (or at least I do) it impairs judgment. I've been through that hell before...not going there again!

What you said about the wave structures aligning themselves cannot be understated. As when they do align themselves they can be extremely powerful. I often refer to a setup in Tradingview for that very same concept. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hmm....yet another painter? There must be something in the air! Anyway, yes, I can understand the feeling of getting too old. Heck, even when I was 32 I realized I wouldn't last, especially doing industrial work. Only the small, wiry guys can do that crap into their sixties. It just beats up the body too much. And any painting, really, is like that. Other trades get to "think" and "ponder" about what their doing, like electricians, for example. But painters? If you're a painter and you're not moving and busting your ass, then you're not working.

Thanks for posting your indis and template - however, I loaded the template and in comparing with some of the screen shots you have put up, I don't understand which one is the HAC. Can you maybe put up a screen shot with labels of the lines? I only see red and green lines on the main chart; in the second indicator window is the RAC along with thin red line for RSI. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hilarious!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
The red one is the HAC. The green is a shorter version of it, which mimics the next lower TF. The green isn't necessary, but I do have a use for it that I'll talk more about later. It does however give a clue if the next lower TF has triggered a trade.

AUDUSD - D1 Long &amp; H1 Short I mentioned last week that the H1 trade that was triggered on this pair had a PT level near the lows of last month. Now, I want you to take a look at the last signal on the D1 chart. It was long. Moreover, the RAC signal was perfect and the price bar was touching the HAC line at the time. Remember when I said that a trade isn't proven invalid until the prior swing is taken out? Keep on remembering it, because if the H1 profit target is hit, you'll likely forget it by then. Plus, on the D1 chart it will show a short through the HAC line (although the RAC will likely not be a clean cross, but we'll see). If the market moves through the D1 HAC today or tomorrow to the short side, then the 1x level will be in the same place as the H1 3x target, which, again, is just above the lows of last month.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
NZDUSD Update Last week we were looking at this pair and anticipated that it might pull back to the 1x line, which it has. It's basically stopped there to the pip; stalled as it were. Anyway, it might touch .66034, which is about 10 pips below that line and then make a run for the high and beyond. The 2x PT line for the last M15 trade is at that level, which is why I'm putting it out there. Some of you might be thinking "Well what about the H1 trade to the short side?" On that one, by the time the RAC crossed, the price was no longer touching the HAC, so we can't count it as a means of projecting PT levels. H4 had a nice RSI PB setup to the long side. The RAC is plastered against the ceiling. Also, M15-M1 are within range to trigger a trade to the long side. It took them awhile to get jockeyed into position, which is why it's always good to wait and leave things alone for a bit.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
USDJPY - Getting active This pair is almost ready to start trading again. M15-M1 are cooperating together fairly well and H1 is moving into range. I'm still thinking it could evolve into an H4 or D1 consolidation pattern, but there are plenty of pips coming regardless

--- 帖子 #146 ---
LESSON TIME! Green &amp; Red Relationship - Pt 1 Ok here's something that will help you, at a glance, recognize the quality of the trade that's developing or that may have triggered. I think it will help people who don't have a lot of screens to work from as well. On the chart below I have the most recent GBPUSD short trade that triggered on M15-M1 as well as on H1. However, when seeing how long it was from the time M15 triggered to the time H1 triggered, it was 22 hours. Such a delay will generally indicate choppiness or lots of reactions, etc... and maybe, just maybe, a failed trade setup. Recall one of the reasons I made this method in the way I did. It was to make money quickly and not tying it up in things that aren't going into profit immediately. The example below is WHY you want very few bars in between TFs (and indeed, why you want to look at the other TFs - which some will be reluctant to do). This thing could jerk around for a long time for all we know, and likely will. Anyway, to expedite matters, you can see where the market first crossed the green line on H1. In most cases, where the green line was crossed, it will be on the very same bar that the next lower TF had the red HAC crossed on.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
GBPAUD-Update Watching with great interest this pair because on Friday it hit a 2x level on the H1 long that was triggered (yellow lines) in anticipation of the H1 short triggered 2 days earlier being invalidated (pink lines). Currently there is another potential short being set up, BUT notice that the RAC is above 50 and pretty flat, which indicates a lower probability on the short side. Plus, if you check M15, you'll see that the M15 side of it triggered 27 M15 bars earlier, which is pretty far away, indicating that if the new short is to hit a profit target, it will struggle on the way down (which is in keeping with this market right now anyway). The setups favor the long side overall. Where I circled in green is the level that we have to watch carefully. If it gets taken out, this market should move extremely fast.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Almuten, thank you for your time in showing us your trading method. Just a question if I may. If we just look at the one time frame, like the 1 hour, and see that the price has crossed the red and the green line both at the same time, then it is a good trade, but if the red and green line is far away from each other then stay away? Is that right?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi Timo, I originally designed this to work with multiple TFs so do be careful if working with only one TF. As far as distance between the red &amp; green goes, there are really two parts to it: 1. The relationship of the green on the higher TF to the red on the next lower. The closer together they are in price, the better. When far apart, the market tends to need to consolidate and "rest" before another trade will be made ready. The point of knowing this though is to know when to step away for awhile and let it do its thing. 2. The number of periods between the crossing of the green &amp; red on the same TF If you're using only one TF then #1 means nothing. But your assumption is correct in that if there is a cross between the red and green on the same bar or just a couple of bars from each other, then this is generally a better trade (it will move quicker) than crossings between many bars.

RAC - "Green Shorty" Version Ok I know everyone out there won't have a powerful enough of a computer to be running lots of instances of these indicators and you don't want to have to keep switching TFs to verify this or that. Anyway, I have something that might help you out if this method really interests you. Though I'm reluctant, I will share this. In my opinion it won't have the same probabilities as a multiple TF setup, but if you're hell-bent on using just one chart, then you might as well lower your risk in the bargain. Plus, I guess it will give additional insights once you become used to it. What can be done is to run another instance of the RAC. On the indicator, there is a multiplier adjustment. On the attached template the colors are set to green and the multiplier to .382, which matches the green HAC line. It works in exactly the same way as the normal HAC&amp;RAC, only executes sooner. I don't think the PT levels are accurate if calculated from it, so it will have limitations. But PLEASE watch the main RAC before executing a trade on the shorter version. If it's buried (like in the example below), then use the "shorty" to execute a with-trend trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hey Crypto! I appreciate you posting this. I worked quite a lot with the TDI, actually. I contemplated using it with this method but the goal was to eliminate as many distractions as possible so, sadly, it had to go. There were also other elements that I wanted a method to address that merely knowing when to execute a trade does not. Risk to reward was one of the biggest concerns. Knowing where the most likely profit target is (and I think this is proving itself pretty well so far), is important in that respect. At least it has a built-in plan. Thanks for posting!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Yeah i know what you mean about too many distractions. Its a struggle with me as well. Try to simplify as much as possible so a clear decision can be made. Anyways i have your system loaded and following, pretty decent imo, keep up the good work!

NZDUSD - Update Ok last week we were looking for a PB on this pair and then for it to take another run at the high. M15 has hit a 2x line to the short side and is very close to triggering a long. 1. Compare it to M5. There weren't many bars. It looks like it will be less than 10 (if it triggers pretty soon). 2. The RAC on M15 isn't crossing 20 yet so watch for that. It might have to make another push down first to get things lined up. 3. H1 is in a good position to trigger too, but the RAC must confirm if this TF is to be considered for PT levels 4. For a target, if the M15 triggers, it will be a touch above last week's high. edit.... Just checked M5 for "cleanness" of the RAC vs HAC. It looks like it will likely pull back first, reset the indys and then make a run for it.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
GBPUSD H1 PB &amp; M1-M15 Setup Example Funny how I used this chart earlier to point out the importance of fewer bars in between TFs, but almost as soon as I posted it, it took a big dump Anyway, this kind of thing happens pretty often with these late crossings. A PB occurs, sets up and then resumes. But it's the interim that's maddening (at least for me). For instance, if an H1 trade was taken on this pair last Friday, it would've went against you at least 60 pips and wouldn't have shown a profit for 20 hours. I don't like those, but it doesn't mean they can't be traded at all. A different strategy can be employed. On the H1, notice that there was a PB to the red &amp; green lines. The RAC looked as though it could've crossed right there. In fact, M1-M15 produced a long trade - a trade that I advised taking, even though it was against the longer term. This one was extremely tight between TFs. BUT notice that the M15 component of this did not produce a fresh cross of the RAC; therefore you'd have to use M5 for a target. The 3x on M5 was exactly at the high of that little swing. Then.... M1-M15 quickly triggered a short within a few periods. The PT target on M15 actually went to 4x this time. 4x targets that get hit generally produce sizable retracements, so it's something to watch for. The market gets a bit overextended for a time.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
USDJPY - Update Currently there's an M15-M1 long setup in progress right now. It meets all the criteria, except maybe the M5-M15 disparity is a little high (11 bars or so)...but that's not what I wanted to talk about. Observe the H1 chart on the far right. The green HAC is 65 pips from the red HAC on M15, which is a pretty big space between them. I marked this on the chart below. Also, I've marked the 3x target for M15, which happens to correspond with the current location of the H1 HAC line. If it does go there, it will be a labored effort.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
3 things to emphasize on this failed trade: 1. The # of bars between M15 &amp; M5 crossings was 14 M5 periods - already a warning that it's going to be rough at best 2. The HAC on H1 was nowhere near to being crossed when M15 triggered - Multi TF cycles are not aligned 3. When a trade becomes invalidated, GET OUT!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
GBPAUD Update The only short trade left to be invalidated is but pips away from being taken out. It hit its 2x level, reversed and then triggered a long trade, then a short trade (which has now been invalidated) and another long. The W1 chart shows the market on the HAC line with the RAC &gt; 80. This one has had me in suspense! Btw, I actually bought this at the last swing low but got nervous because I had to leave and make dinner and didn't think it would do anything. I think I need to buy a monkey to do my trading for me

--- 帖子 #158 ---
OI, I resemble that remark I was at work and saw GBPAUD shoot back up on the hourly, couldn't do a thing about it. I have netdania on the smartphone just to keep an eye on things during the day

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hey I use Netdania too...and for the same reasons.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Can you please show a complete trade? In the graph, including the SL and PT.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Sure dokopy. In the pic below there are two charts. The one on the left is H1. The trade was triggered with a nice clean cross while the price action was still in the HAC. Stop loss would be placed beneath the low. A few hours later, an H4 trade was triggered, only this time the cross was of a different type. It crossed above 20 as the HAC was being penetrated by the price. When trades trigger in rapid succession like this, it makes them particularly strong, especially when the RAC is just coming out of 20 for longs and down from 80 for shorts. Also (I didn't show this), if you check when M15 had a trigger, you'd see that it happened just before the H1 triggered. When M15 triggered, M5 had just triggered, etc... Initial stops are always beneath the prior high or low. They do not have to be hit, but it's wise, I think, to calculate the risk in this way. If the trade isn't going to work out (this is especially true when you're playing higher TFs like H1 &amp; H4), an M15-M1 series will set up the other way and you should close the original trade and reverse. That way you can make some money after taking a small loss on your original position. Trades are officially closed when: 1. They have hit a 3x level 2. They have their stops taken out Until one of those events occurs, the trade is still considered active and will have an influence on the overall market action. Moreover, multiple trades can be active. Even trades going the opposite way can be active (which happens in consolidating markets - like in the GBPAUD lately). As far as profit targets go, as in the example below, the swing low to the HAC line is where you draw the "collective risk" area (see a prior post #74 for this explanation). I set my fibs in even increments - 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and so on because that's how human beings think when it comes to taking profits. They do this collectively. 3x, especially on an H4 chart, is where I consider the trade to be ended. It's rare that it goes further than that. On H1, the PT can hit 4x (see second pic). Oftentimes, the 4x on H1 is equal to the 3x on H4 (as in this example). Does this help?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Well thank you. As I see it: The H1 is input invalid because RAC is higher than 20. PT 3x would not work. H4 on the input OK. PT 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x is easy to find in the history. I have to decide after accession.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
For me it is also invalid input H4. The first candle is wrong RAC. The second candle is wrong HAC.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi dokopy, Can you please explain what you mean a little bit more? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something and I didn't want to comment on something you didn't mean. What are your observations and thinking on this?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I think I understand you now since you sent that pic. Here's what mine looked like up close. Maybe it's just a slight difference in brokers, etc... I don't really know. Anyway, at the time of the cross, the HAC on mine was 166.556. But look, in all reality, that HAC line, going from one bar to the next, is oftentimes going to have an angle to it. In that case, you have to eyeball it anyway. Will it make a difference? Sure. It will be a few pips off now and then. I've been putting these lines on for the last, I dunno, six months for 8-12 hours a day testing this stuff, so most likely I'll be able to give it the right amount of "Kentucky windage" when needed. But here's a tip. Watch the way the market acts when it hits the 1x, 2x lines and so on. If it seems to overshoot them a bit or under shoot them before reversing and making reactions, well, then try to draw the lines a little different if it matters to you. I like them to be as accurate as possible because I think it's a great piece of information to have. Did I address what concerned you dokopy?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Invalid input H1 is your first picture.

Thanks for this GreenShorty. Here a "quick&amp;dirty" trade on GJ M1: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I exited way too early - as always - and missed another 120 pips instead of just rolling down along the cloud...

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Nice one! And congrats! I don't know if you want to mess with this, but in my research I tried a lot of things from many different methods. Since you like Ichimoku, try using the RAC as a means of a cloud-break confirmation. This works really well, especially if you lengthen the RAC multiplier to 2.00. When the RSI of it pops up, it's a good indication that the cloud will be at least partially penetrated. Like anything else, it works best if the market isn't too choppy.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
If well managed with tight stops, choppy market is by far covered by the trend trades.

Almuten My friend could you assist in connecting continuously-moving cross-hair orange if possible please explain how to do this, or do better HACnRAC -Shorty .tpl Template without this feature. Thanks in advance vvFish

--- 帖子 #172 ---
GLOBAL CROSSHAIRS - the "pesky orange line" If you want to turn off the orange crosshairs, just open it up and make the first selection false. Or remove it altogether. It's not a requirement of the method/system anyway. It's only there to help verify a trade during backtesting/learning the system. Trades going forward in time, if you're watching them set up in real time, can be checked for 'tightness' between TFs without the use of the crosshairs. Again, I just thought it would be more convenient for learning purposes, as I certainly found them useful. Thanks goes to vvFish for bringing it up As suggested, I have here two templates with no crosshairs on them.

GBPUSD Here's two active H1 trades going on with this pair right now. Remember that all the H4 trades to the long side have been fulfilled...unless it does a rare thing and go to an H4 4x level. This we can't know for sure. Anyway, when the market hit the 1x level on the H1 short, it bounced off of it and set up an H1 long. Checking the lower TFs, this trade was actually really clean. Not many bars between H1 &amp; M15 or between M15 &amp; M5, etc... But see how it bounced from the 1x level on the long side? so far, this current PB isn't setting up an M15-M1 short. It did set up an M5-M1, which isn't very strong. It will likely make a new high today at least. [edit] I just noticed that the RAC is at 95 on M15 and price is nearly touching the HAC line. I think this is the makings of a real bounce up, but we'll see. H4 has a PB setup with the RSI, as the RAC is &gt; 80 D1 RAC is not near to crossing 20 so I wouldn't expect anything major.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
If there is a bounce up, then it will likely happen when the green HAC on M5 catches up to the red on M1. When they're in the same place, it will be more likely then. Also, notice that M15 is set up for a PB.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I'm not sure why I like these complex situations. I guess I find them fascinating, plus it tests the robustness of various theories. Anyway, I wanted to point out that the M5 portion of this setup was 'late' in the RAC crossing, which also generally points to a reversal of the setup. And it is currently resting on its 1x level. That level is also the equilibrium point for the H1 long that was set up earlier - or is a few pips shy of it.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Exceptions to the rules? ... there's a logical reason. Opinions wanted, please Earlier today I starting to write a post with regard as to when one might disregard certain rules or at least diminish their importance. After watching the Yen pairs fall out of the sky - USDJPY in particular, I spent the past 5 days or so considering why this might be the case when on the USDJPY the HAC &amp; RAC were, 'officially' not well synchronized enough. I even said I wanted to stay away from them for that reason. Anyway, in the process of writing my post I noticed GBPUSD in the process of setting up a PB trade, so I got onto that one with the intention of resuming my revised theory as to when one might 'relax' certain rules. Well now seems as good a time as any to resume my original intent. Recall that I generally want to know the 'context' of the market. In particular, I want to know if there are any active H4 trades; meaning ones that have not hit a 3x profit target or that have not been invalidated by having their stops taken out. Well last week GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDJPY &amp; USDJPY had all of their 3x H4 profit targets hit to the long side and these were even called and plotted in advance. There wasn't a single 3x level left on any of them. Consequently, an M15-M1 setup is enough to trigger an avalanche, which in the case of the Yen pairs especially, was the case. Now, how often are we in such a condition? Not that often, really. Generally there are going to be active H4 trades happening throughout, which will provide a certain amount of tension that prevails and thus, will be reflected in the 'normal' operation of the indicators and the relationships between TFs. When that tension is gone, when the interested parties in one direction are no longer present, can we always expect things to act the same? I'm not so sure it's reasonable. I'd like to relax my dogmatism a little in light of this logic. Take a look at the H1 &amp; H4 charts of the USDJPY. Both had the HAC crossed when the RAC was nowhere near to crossing 80. As you've all seen by now, this relationship is important. But in this case, the market overruled the relationship on both TFs. The M15-M1 setup was fine - excellent even (if you care to find it). However, on those TFs, there were active (but poor quality) M15 trades happening to the long side. There was 'tension' on that time frame, but not on the longer ones.

I agree FerruFx. I don't think I have the skill or objectivity to deal with chop yet, but I know a lot of people are really good at it.

GBPUSD - Reason for sharp recent PB Generally there are multiple TFs that are showing 'x levels' in the same places - often to the very pip. I like to point these out because it's good information. Anyway, M15 showed a 3x target in the same place as did a 1x level for the H1 that triggered around the same time. Kinda spooky the way these things work out isn't it? Anyway, the smaller TFs generally support the higher in this way. For the H1 long to resume (provided it doesn't fail - recall my post with regard to H4 3x profit levels being taken out), an M15 ought to set up and give it some juice. An M5 will likely not do it.

GBPUSD Why stop beating a dead horse? Ok, if I was to relax my hard &amp; fast rules that requires a RAC cross under the conditions that there be no active H4 trades in the opposite direction, then the GBPUSD would officially have an H4 short in progress right now just because it crossed the HAC line. Moreover, the 1x on it would be near the lows on the D1 chart - about 58 pips away from it. This is a pretty sensible target. On the chart below I marked the x level for our hypothetical H4 trade as well as the failure point for the current H1 long. It's just something to keep an eye on because between that failure point and the 1x target for a short, there are about 200 pips. Granted, by then there ought to be a better quality H4 set up because this thing isn't following the same pattern as the Yen pairs. Those just blew past the HAC without any concern for the RAC and kept on truckin'. This one is up to something devious

Hi Alumten, How exactly is it again you determine the profit targets? Is is simply from the previous swing low, (or high), or do any fibs come into play also?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I changed my fib defaults to reflect the 1x, 2x levels and changed the labels (see pic below). As for where to draw them, use the high for shorts, the low for longs. The red HAC line is the other point (get it as close as you can and don't let it "snap" to the price bar)

USDJPY - Possible support As I was putting together an expose` on this pair using 'x levels,' I noticed 2 things that will lend support, likely tomorrow. 1. There's a 3x H4 target coming up 2. The 3x target is in the same area as the green HAC on the monthly. Before you get to thinking it's time to go long, it will be some time. I think after the target is reached, it will take a few days at least to set up a respectable long.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
GBPUSD I wanted to show where the green M5 and the red M1 met in that PB setup on GBPUSD today. This is true of all markets that are just going straight down. It takes time to get them back in sync.

GBPUSD - Current Conditions &amp; Something to Watch Here's a chart that's marked up with the current situation on M15 &amp; H1. After the market made a good high it set up an H1 short that hit a 1x profit level several days ago. Then it set up an M15 and an H1 long. The M15 hit its 3x profit target earlier yesterday and sold off sharply. Then it set up another M15 long. The 3x target on that is near the high, after which it will likely sell off again (if it gets there). Now, with all this context in mind, I want to point out something before it happens so you can watch this. I'm going to talk about this more in the days ahead. Note the RAC on H1. It is climbing toward 80. Recall in an earlier lesson some posts back (I think it's around post #124 or so) where I talked about the RAC when it climbs above 80 &amp; below 20. In that example I showed the relationship between that and the way moving averages fan out during a strong trend. Now you can plainly see that on that H1 chart, if you were to put moving averages on it, they would not be fanning out. This market is struggling. That trend is not strong. Under conditions like this, the 80 &amp; 20 levels will act like support &amp; resistance. This is often true of the 50 level as well. In fact, when the low of the prior swing was made, the RAC had just crossed through the 50 level. The RAC kept heading south, but the price began to reverse. This happens a LOT in choppy, consolidating markets. But I'll find more examples of that and illustrate the full concept in detail.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
NZDUSD - Current Conditions The chart below is reminiscent of the GBPUSD chart, is it not? Gee, it's almost like there's a mysterious hand at work orchestrating all of this. Anyway, you can see that the picture is pretty similar. There was a 1x H1 short target that marked the low of the last swing, then two H1 trades that set up. One was fulfilled. The remaining one, if it comes to fruition, will be precisely at the high on the H4 chart. Recall that we predicted that the old high would be revisited and perhaps even surpassed by 135 pips to an H4 3x target. (See post 106).

--- 帖子 #187 ---
GBPAUD - Update I had hoped this market would have resumed its bull campaign once the one active short trade was taken out, but alas, it was not to be... not yet anyway. Instead, it fulfilled a 3x target for an H1 trade (high made on the 9th). Now there is still an active H1 &amp; 2 H4 trades happening to the long side at present, so there's a lot of upward tension. However, a valid and very 'tight' H1 set up yesterday to the short side took place. The 3x target on that is a mere few pips above the low that set up the last H4 trade. If that low gets taken out, then it will invalidate one of the long trades. I know it's really hidden in that mess, but it's there. It's already bounced from its 1x level so I know there's something to it. If the place where I marked "watch' gets taken out, then that trade will be off the board. Maybe then this market can go about its business.

Fuzzy Matters - How to choose the appropriate high or low Given some of the markets have had a lot of chop lately, this situation has undoubtedly come up in your minds. The problem is that sometimes after a trade is set up, it is unclear which high or low to use when calculating a profit target. As we've seen, profit targets play a major role in choppy conditions, so to draw them from the appropriate places is important. There's a logic to this. It isn't arbitrary. Take a look at Trade #1. The price/HAC cross is marked as is the RAC crossing. So far, so good. We have a valid trade. Now, which low do we use? Is it "A" or "B"? This is the question you will have in your mind. Here's how to think about it and then make the correct determination: Consider for a moment what we're after. Recall the logic that governs this method. It's about finding equilibrium points and "unlikely events." We're looking for special places where disagreement or market manipulation has occurred and then a resolution arrived at. These special places are marked by two factors: 1. A HAC that is crossed by the price 2. A RAC cross that occurs while the price is being crossed What has happened between point A &amp; B? The HAC was touched, but the RAC did not cross. There's no 'special event' in between them. This is why you would select "A" because it is this point that the collective risk has been taken from. This is an H1 chart. If you went to an M15 chart, there could be a valid trade setup on both A &amp; B, but as we've also seen, this is a matter all by itself. It will have its own targets and so on. Look at the recent short trade that set up on Trade #2. The same logic applies and for the same reasons. "C" would be the high chosen to project a profit target. And, like in Trade #1, there might be an M15 that set up on both highs. But again, this is a matter all on its own.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
USDJPY Update Ok, it looks as if the 3x H4 target and the Weekly green HAC line is showing us some support for this pair. But I wanted to emphasize, once again, that the relationships between the green HAC on the next higher TF to the red HAC on the lower is significant. This is important because you'll know to bide your time - and that you really do, in fact, have time, to do some good analysis and wait for a perfect setup. So far today there were only M1-M15 setups and the only really perfectly formed one was on M1. The various HAC lines on M15-M1 have made contact with each other though. These will be ok to take setups on. Below is a picture of the longer TFs at present:

GBPJPY/USDJPY correlation As I know most of you are aware, many currencies have pretty strong correlations with each other. The GBPJPY often moves with the USDJPY. Anyway, I wanted to point out that on the GJ, it too has hit a 3x level on H4. You'll find this often happens with pairs that move together. Also, on the GJ, it has touched up against its monthly HAC line.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Almuten, I like the cycles in the markets concept and also have looked at Aliens thread. I was backtesting your system on the 5 min GBPJPY. There is a lot of times when the price just chops back and forth the HAC, also the RAC is crossing all over the place, but then suddenly the price will shoot off for a really good trade, and then back the other way for a really good trade. How would you know when to take the trade after all the chop? because the good trade looks just like part of the chop untill the price just takes off, and it's too late. May be 5 min TF is not the one to trade on this system. Have you used any ADX indicators, like on Aliens thread? Or do you think the ADX is unnecessary? By the way, I don't really want any more indicators, already my computer is very slow running your system on only 6 instruments!

Homage to Captain Jack Attached Image When I began this thread I gave credit to forexalien for multiple TF analysis, learning to wait for the TFs to align and so on, but there's another person that inspired some of the other components of this method and I think if what I'm doing appeals to you, then "The Captain" is worth a read. His approach is entirely the opposite of forexalien in that he uses no indicators at all. The Captain's "edge" lies in the premise he holds behind all market movement; it lies in the way that he thinks about it. The premise behind the Captain's method is that price is actually driven with intent - driven by brokers and market makers to specific places that will trap traders into making losing trades. His account statements speak for themselves and his accuracy rate, like forexalien, is above 95% with an R:R that is often above 10:1. You just have to respect that, regardless if you want to agree with his premise or not. If you care to read his thread, it's on Steve Hopwood's forum. http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/php...hp?f=59&amp;t=1572 While I wanted to use the Captain's method in that it was an uncluttered approach, there were particular elements that I found too subjective for me. Plus Alien's ways tugged at my elbow. But I took what the Captain said to heart: Market makers and brokers drive the market. If you've ever felt 'tricked' into making a bad trade, you likely have been. How many times has an oscillator "popped," got you excited and you just jumped on it and then within minutes it shot the other way? Yeah, "they" know how to move an oscillator with the price. "They" know where the key fib levels, round numbers, pivot points and trend lines are. "They" know how to get traders interested and into the slaughterhouse. At any rate, if the markets are driven to certain places with a specific intent, it can only mean that there's a lot of capital investment to get them there. If they are driven by deep pockets, then those participants must seek a return on their investment. Moreover, that return should be worth the time and trouble. They aren't likely making a killing; perhaps a few percent when it's all said and done, but then again, that's all a casino does. This is the reasoning behind the "x levels." That's why they're important to use. They aren't "magical lines" like the fibs. They represent returns on investment ; returns that these "investors" WILL collect one way or another. All I'm trying to do with this is place a trade with the people who will win every time. It's important to figure out where their interests are, which is why this method has some pretty precise elements to it and is "picky" sometimes. I can't play the same way they do, but if I can divine their strategy and intentions, I can then find precise ways to participate along with them. Anyway... "God bless the Captain!"

USDJPY &amp; GBPJPY - HAC lines On both of these pairs the longer term HAC lines - green &amp; red are coming into alignment. GJ M15 &amp; H1 are only 25 pips apart; UJ are only 45 apart. By tomorrow the M15 &amp; H1 will be meeting one another, so setups that occur on M15 &amp; below should work well. H1 &amp; H4 lines will likely take until Monday to get into alignment.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Timo, Yeah, M5 is pretty dicey with this. Just the spread alone will diminish your returns on that TF. But like I keep saying, multiple TFs are best. I like to see them occur in rapid succession M1, then M5, M15, etc... all very quickly after one another. Moreover, this method was designed with profit targets in mind - very specific reasons for them in fact. I have used ADX but I found it isn't necessary with this. After months of attempting it to add value with it I finally decided that I could do without it, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be useful in an EA. It just added nothing to the way I wanted to trade this. Part of Alien's method relies on momentum - the ebb and flow of it. It allows the market to "rest," consolidate and then explode. The way he uses ADX accommodates this. However, the green HAC on a larger TF in relation to the red on the next lower TF does the same thing, but it doesn't require the indicator to 'reset' like ADX often needs to. This is one reason Alien uses about 5 different systems at the same time. The ADX portion of it is one of the best though. Anyway, the reason the market needs this 'rest' is because other TFs need to catch up. That's all that is happening. What you might do however is write an EA that compares M5 red HAC to M15 green HAC. If they are far apart and the M5 is leading up by x number of pips, then you have a strong trend and should only be long. Same with shorts. Let M5 red lead by x pips down to M15 green and then only go short. Or you could try this relationship between say M15 and H1 and filter your M5 trades that way. Keep to one direction until the lines meet and then separate again the other way. I'll bet your results will improve markedly. The reason it will improve is because the slaughter is complete and the market is ready to move. When more killing is required, the market makers will gather together everyone in the same area and into the "chop shop" prior to another run. The real calculation hog is the RAC. This is what slows the computer. If this is a big concern, you can approximate the true RAC by using an RSIOMA and making the length of it around 25-40 periods. It won't work precisely like the real one does, but it will give you a solid bias as to direction and trend strength. You could probably play with the length periodically and calibrate it each day or so if needed. You could also filter the directional bias using multiple TFs of the RAC. Read Alien's use of RSIOMA on his thread. It operates in pretty much the same way. Heck, use the RSIOMA itself. It's not a calculation hog. Let me know if this makes sense or if you think it will help. Thanks for the question!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
On my charts GJ M15 is 82 - and H1 278 apart, UJ not much different, strange While still trying to digest all you have been teaching I would need to come up with some sort of methodical approach in order to be able to trade this. I keep missing good entries while flipping through charts. Until someone comes up with a dashboard-like solution (I am no dasboard fan b.t.w..) I'll maybe better stick to 1 or 2 pairs...

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Easier Calculating RAC Ok, I know a lot of you want a quicker calculating RAC. I know, it's a calculation hog so here's another one that won't do that. It's one that I made myself, so it's not adaptive. IT HAS A QUIRK and it may or may not annoy you, but here it is: Each time you change the TF on the chart the indicator will basically replot itself according to what the current market cycle is. For instance, let's say you're working on an M5 chart at 10:00 am. You put this indy on there and it will say "RSIOMA(28) in the upper left corner of the indicator window box. Then let's say at 12:00 you change the TF and then back again. It might say "RSIOMA(42). What it does is grab the cycle period and then use that value for the length until the chart is refreshed, etc... This might actually be ok, especially if you're about to get a HAC cross and want to verify it with the RAC. Just refresh the chart and it will have the current cycle on it. It won't match the original exactly though.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I think you're comparing red to red instead of green to red , because that's what I have too when I do that. As for the 'dashboard,' yes I often wondered about that too. There's likely an optimal way to do that, but usually those things are misleading and give non-pertinent information too much of the time. But let's think on it. Maybe a "pipometer" between green &amp; red HAC lines? Also, this is one of the reasons I like the longer TF setups. There's plenty of time to spot H4 and even H1 trades most times. But even if you only focused on a couple of pairs and you had a good idea as to the overall structure of each one, well, that's not too bad either.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Right! I have been sleeping there and measured on the same TF Why not put the next higher TF -HAC on the same chart - possible?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
No worries! It's so easy to make mistakes. But yeah, I would like to look into that. I'm not sure how to do it or if it would slow the computer too much if multi-TFs are being used on the same chart with calculations like those. Maybe if FerruFX comes around we can ask him.

USDJPY - X Levels I thought this was a nice illustration of how the x levels stack onto each other and is worthy of note. First of all, they did not occur in rapid succession and as we've seen several times before, this generally indicates a choppy or consolidating situation in the offing. Second, I want you to see that there's a definite relationship between time frames, which is why it's beneficial to utilize more than just one. Third, there was a sizable bounce from those levels, being all clustered together like that. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
This pair had its HAC lines meet for the first time in quite awhile on H1 &amp; M15 and had a nice run afterward. I hope to explain soon more about what to do with this information. At any rate, expect the H1 to now be setting ranges and 'x levels.' But don't expect those to go any further than 1x into profit until the green HAC on H4 catches up to H1 red.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Almuten, thank you very much for the explanations and clear graphs you show us. I am just wondering how you would know that the m15 chart is not going any further than 1X? Or is it going further? Is there any way of telling? Or is it something like if the HAC and RAC align on all 3 timeframes, then the largest of the 3 timeframes will usually go 3X? Do I understand it right? Thanks! and have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hey Timo, I have a long answer to your question, but I think it will answer many questions you and others will have in the future... and you'll probably teach me a thing or two as well because, my God, people on this forum are smart! At extreme tops and bottoms, especially after all H4 3x targets have been cleared away, for the market to have a significant move in the other direction, it will take some 'coaxing' and the drawing in of traders who have to lose their money first (or who are about to lose their money) in order for the market to move. This is the purpose of the heavily orchestrated "chop zones." These zones trigger all sorts of systems from support &amp; resistance to oscillator-based methodologies and even discretionary traders playing various pattern formations. These are the places where most systems and methods experience heavy drawdowns, like being eaten in little bites by piranhas. Moreover, traders tend to utilize one TF for their various systems and overall habits. To make money, you have to be a creature of habit; otherwise whatever probabilities you've calculated using whatever system or method you've developed means nothing. That's why traders tend to do the same things in the same ways. They have to. Now the HAC lines, when they enter the area where a significant top or bottom was made, will also reflect the budding interest of the players who are trading from that particular TF. The higher TF green HAC line, when it is in contact with the next lower TF red HAC line, shows when that interest is beginning. It shows that the higher TF cycles are getting in sync again with the lower TF cycles. Small TF players are mixing in with the longer term and so on. The more TFs involved, the larger the moves will be. Attached Image IF you don't want to think like a criminal (though I think it's fun), that's ok too. There's another way to see this. It's a mathematical principle that's based in "crowd wisdom." For instance, I once saw a documentary called "The Code." It's on Netflix if you want to watch it. Anyway, a mathematician did an experiment where he counted out something like 4,850 jelly beans and put them in a glass jar. Then he went around to random people and asked about 160 of them how many jelly beans they thought were in that jar. The answers varied widely. The extreme guesses were between 50,000 and 500. But here's the thing: When all the guesses were averaged together, that average was only off by 4 jelly beans. How profound is that?! The lesson is simple: Precision is possible utilizing crowd wisdom. The question is: "How do we make use of it?" What's happening in the market is basically the same thing. The moving averages that comprise the HAC represent the range of "collective guesses" as to the true price of the market. The RAC represents the momentum toward one side or the other, or, which side will prevail on that particular TF. The "winning side" will have an expectation for profit and take off their positions accordingly. They got what they wanted out of it and thus, the market will have to 'reset' and gather in both sides once again. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, to answer your question more specifically... If, say, M1, M5 &amp; M15 were the only TFs in the area, then I would use M5 for 3x targets and M15 for 1x. When H1 moves into the area, then M15 will have a better chance of hitting a 3x. When H4 moves in, then H1 can hit a 3x. When D1 moves in, then H4 can hit a 3x target. In order for a lower TF to hit a 3x target, it generally takes the "juice" of a larger TF and the interest of the players on that TF to get it there. Initially what will be happening is that the longer term players will be taking off profitable positions and exiting. Why? Because they are seeing a top or bottom forming and that the swings are getting larger and and more powerful the opposite way that they're positioned in. That's where the first bit of juice comes from to get it to move the other way. Also, consider that the MAs that comprise the HAC lines on the longer TF will begin to be penetrated. Traders on those longer TFs will be playing those averages and begin to make their 'collective guesses' accordingly. Some will be playing a 30 period, others a 21, etc... but when those averages start to get penetrated and the market spends more and more time on the opposite side of the direction they're positioned in, the less likely they'll add to their positions and the more likely they will remove the profitable ones they have. Almuten

Thanks Almuten, excellent explanation. I just didn't understand your statement "The higher TF green HAC line, when it is in contact with the next lower TF red HAC line, shows when that interest is beginning." Are you talking about the same TF chart? Also, after a period of consolidation, like in my example below, the two lines are entangled with each other, how would you know when the big move is going to take place? How would you read the RAC line? Or would you just not trade when the RAC is neither above or below 20 or 80? That by the way is the gbpjpy 4H chart. gbpjpy.JPG

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hey Timo, There are several things I can talk about here. First, what I meant by the higher TF green HAC line making contact with the red HAC on the lower TF is not on the same chart. It's at the price level. Second, it's fine to take trades when the RAC is not coming out of 80 or 20. Is it more likely that it's a big trade if it does? Yes, but is it necessary? No. Just crossing its own average constitutes a shift in momentum toward one side or the other. Third, it's impossible to know when a big move is going to take place. All we know is how to determine the greatest probability factors involved. For instance, M15 &amp; H1 triggered on the same H4 bar that went through the the HAC. And if that wasn't enough warning, the D1 triggered the very next day (so you had plenty of time to consider it). Regardless though, it's always a surprise, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Ok, thanks for that Almuten, I am trying to understand this method to the best of my ability, have read your posts throughout the thread at least twice. I like to trade 4H bars, so, what would I do? -Should I check the instruments I like to trade at the end of every 4 hours, -and if I see a bar has crossed the red HAC line, then I see if the green HAC line is nearby? -If it is nearby, say 2 or 3 bars, (Or should that be a certain amount of pips?), -then I check the RAC line if it has crossed within 2 or 3 bars, -if it has, then I check the same things on the 1H time frame, -and if the 1H time frame conditions are acceptable, should I check the daily or the 15M? I'm just trying to come up with a methological way to trade this system. Is this something that you do Almuten? If not, what do you do? and how are you going with your live $500 account?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Timo, I want to focus on trading H4 too so we're on the same page. Anyway, you will begin to see potential setups long before they occur on that TF. For instance, the RSI on the RAC will pop the other way first. This shows that the RAC has begun to turn. It's based on 2 periods of the RAC so it will catch the smallest, imperceptible (by eye) change possible. If this occurs when the RAC is plastered against the ceiling or on the floor, then its' most likely a pullback in the larger trend (which you can trade, but will have to use a lower TF to find the setup on). However, if it's not above 80 or below 20, then it shows that within a few periods it's going to give a signal in the form of a crossing. That's warning #1 Having seen this warning, you can check to see if H1 has done anything or if it's about to. Perhaps H1 has crossed its green HAC line. If so, check M15 to see if it's crossed its red HAC line. If it has, go back and check how tightly the lower TFs have aligned. This will give you a good idea as to the potential vigor of the move. I would think that after awhile you can preempt a few things. For instance, if you're alerted by the RSI on H4 and you go backward and check the lower TFs and see, if they've formed good setups, that it would be wise to take a trade immediately, even before H4 has given an official signal, then that would be ok too. Check the PTs on them and see if they were met whether or not they would surpass the red HAC on H4. If so, it's even better. If you do play preemptively you'll have to be careful to watch the curvature of the RAC on H4. If it's flat, then it shows that the market has been going sideways. In situations like that, the RSI will move back and forth a lot sometimes. Also, the other TFs will be giving signals both ways and if you look too hard, you might find justification for taking a trade early when you actually shouldn't. Just watch that. As for my trading, I'm working on trying to stay in smaller trades for short time periods. I'm only playing .01 lots so it's no big deal monetarily. BUT I have made progress in that I can actually sleep now with a position on. I even took a loss the other day and it didn't bother me. When it comes to actually trading Forex, I'm just a baby in a lot of ways. My issues are psychological for the most part. I'm learning to trust myself again to not go into self-destructive modes of operation. In the past I've put myself through hell and back by allowing my mind to play tricks on me. And it really can do that! It can see things that aren't there, be convincing that something is a good idea when it isn't, once exception to the rules is ok, and so on. When I take trades now, all sorts of "thought forms" come up. They're like phantoms. So I just "look" at them and "breathe" until they're gone. This is really where I'm at right now with this. I know it's very basic and even laughable to a lot of people because they've been doing this for so long, but I've learned that it's best to just accept where I am and deal with it rather than try to "false bravado" my way through it. I know from experience that faking my way through my fears will bite me in the ass when I least expect it.

GBPJPY H4 Involvement I've been watching this pair closely after it hit an M15 3x target. I wish I had the time to post this earlier but I had some job interviews, etc... Anyway, M15 gave signals in both directions prior to the drop, which is why it's good to watch what's happening on the higher TFs. Things start to move quickly after a longer TF comes online. It's almost like H1 was "waiting" for H4 to catch up, isn't it? Once it did so, H1 could set up a good trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now that H4 is involved, we can start to expect 3x targets from H1. Let's now see where those targets end up. You can see that 3x on H1 is about 100 pips or so above the low and 4x is directly on it. If it makes it there, this will pull H4 down into an area where it can then align for an ideal trade setup.

GBPUSD H4 This one is a messy H4 trade. It had a pullback prior to really moving down, but if you check the time of the crossing of the RAC, you'll see that it was late by a bar or two. The same happened on the H1 portion of this trade. This is one of the reasons that timing is critical because if you place a stoploss too close to a situation like this, you're probably going to lose 70% of the time or more. Anyway, I wanted to point out, once again, the symmetry of these trades and how precise the collective thinking actually is. The 1x on this H4 trade is EXACTLY in the same place as is the equilibrium point in the last long H4 trade setup. The 2x is EXACTLY on the last major low found on the D1 chart H4 is capable of hitting a 2x or higher because the green HAC on D1 matches exactly with the red on H4 (in case you're wondering)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
NZDUSD H4 In this chart the D1 green has not caught up to the H4 red. They are still about 50 pips apart. This means that H4 will likely stop right where it is at 1x. It might sit for a bit and consolidate while D1 catches up and then go down to 2x or lower. If it does go to 3x, it will be a few pips from the low on D1. But remember that on this pair, there is still an unfulfilled H4 long. Two weeks ago it hit its 2x target to the pip, backed off and tried again. It's going to be a factor in the overall balance. If the current H4 short trade makes it to its 2x target, it will be in exactly the same place as the remaining active H4 long was triggered. [edit] I just noticed something else about this. Look at D1. The RAC is above its average and the price is nearly resting on the red HAC line.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
NZDUSD - possible long setup to watch Ok, now having seen that there's a good argument for a support area - an H4 1x and a D1 HAC line, we ought to look and see if the lower TFs are making x levels. On M15 and H1 both, 4x levels are coming up. Again, these levels are somewhat rare and generally indicate very pronounced reversals. M5 green has caught up to M1 red. This is the first clue that a bottom could be forming. Then we'd watch M15 catch up with M5 and so on. If you want to make a play like this, then be realistic with the M1 &amp; M5. If they are far apart, then it's going to take more time for some kind of basing pattern. Once accomplished, there will be 10 or so bars in between an M1 and M5 trigger. But also look at M15. Is it coming into range of M5? If so, then it too might become involved. If not, then don't expect much without a lot of chop, etc...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
NZDUSD - Be careful with this I want to point out that what the M1 chart is showing, in reality, is broker/market maker manipulation. At least that's what Cap'n Jack would say. This is some evidence that there's interest in this area already discussed. However, if this is broker manipulation, then there's also a likelihood of then gunning everybody's stops by hitting 2x prior to going long. Note the chart on the far right. It's an H1 - the first H1 trade to the short side initiated after a major top was made. Also note that the market has respected these levels thus far (this is something to pay attention to, btw). What could likely happen is to get people interested in going long, get them long, and then gun the stops at the H1 2x level I marked out. This also serves to get more people involved on the short side who can then be taken for a ride to their stops at a significant swing high. If an M15 gets triggered long, we'll probably be able to find where that is.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
NZDUSD- Getting into position Note the H1 - hit a perfect 2x target M15 - a 6x (very unusual) target M5 - 4x target HAC green &amp; red have to be pulled into position. If this is a good trade, then all the TFs should trigger one after another very quickly. A good way to do this is when M15 green is penetrated, then M5 ought to have triggered on the same M15 bar. The same with M5 green penetration. M1 should have triggered a trade on the same M5 bar (or within a minute or two). The H1 chart will likely not be involved in this trade. The HAC line is very far away as yet and the RAC will take time to turn.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
GBPJPY - Bounce alert In the chart below, several major targets are about to be hit and they are all in the same place - within a pip or two. H1 2x M15 4x M5 4x Also, the H1 RAC has just crossed the 50 line. Since this market isn't really trending right now in either direction, the 50 level often proves to be support/resistance. (More on this concept later) If it set up long for any sustained period, it will have to rest for a bit first. M5-M1 setup would be ok, but don't count on M15.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I took this trade a little bit ago. It set up in the way it should've, but I wish H1 was a little closer to the action. But then again...they're never really 'perfect,' are they?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I probably have a pretty bad risk/reward profile on this trade. For one, I can't really depend on more than an M15 1x target because the H1 is still too far away to be of help. If I had been a little more alert, I would've taken the trade on M5 instead of waiting for M15. Anyway, a 1x on M15 is in the same place as a 4x on M5 on this trade. I will have to take profits around there I think.

I got in earlier - too early? and also 10 pips late. Let's see if it reaches 6614. Comments welcome! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I got out after the 3x on M5 was taken out. Then it backed off. I probably should have stuck with my original intent to hang on for M5 4x and M15 1x. The H1 green HAC has been crossed, along with a 'green shorty' RAC crossing...but it doesn't sync up well with M15, which makes me think it will have to cycle down and then back up again. [edit] I think there's a major meeting today as well. I've noticed oftentimes these 'cycles' will align/position themselves when the news events are about to come out.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Yeah, it wasn't the best of entries. But you don't seem to have an issue pulling the trigger like I do Maybe you should play M1 crossings after a cluster of x levels are hit. You seem to have the nerve for it!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Ok, here are the results of that 'bounce trade.' After fiddling around (see highlighted area on M5 chart), the M1 and M5 gave simultaneous signals. A 2x level was hit for M5, which is pretty good considering that M15 offered no support. It was just a pullback in the larger trend.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
GBPJPY - M15 pullback example I really wish I had been watching THIS pair more closely. Anyway, recall that a bounce had been called earlier. It came down the same way it went up, only with a much better setup. M15 had an RSI pullback setup. The RAC was below 10 and very flat, which makes this setup near perfect. After the bounce up was completed, M1 triggered and then M5. M15 crossed the green HAC line within the same period or just after. This is the kind of nice, clean succession we want. Now if only I can get myself to find THOSE setups instead of the choppy crap!

--- 帖子 #222 ---
GBPAUD - Potential bottom I almost gave up on this pair but after two weeks of futzing around, it finally began to move. Anyway, this pair is up against a W1 HAC line with the RAC &gt; 80. There's also an RSI PB setup on this TF. But that's not what got my attention. At the 1.9990 level there are several x levels clustering together as follows: H4 has two 2x levels H1 has a 4x level M15 has a 3x level This is a good area to watch for a solid setup. It might have to jockey around for a bit, as I'm sure there's a lot of interest so close to a round number.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Isn't there some kind of trader's maxim that says to stick with one's original plan? Oh if only I could! Haha! But I suppose that's another skill, isn't it? Planning and analysis is one thing, but sticking to it is quite another! Anyway, my original plan on this pair was fulfilled.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I Wish I Could Trade Better...but I wish I could trade better in order to build confidence in how this works. I'm just not there and I want to be. I know how much time a person has to invest in order to learn something new and seeing somebody that's successful already makes it appear worth the time and effort one has to put in. Time is, after all, finite. I want to be able to give that confidence. I mean, a lot of the calls I've been making have been pretty good; it's just the execution on my part that's been missing. There's the actual trading I need practice with, but there are also subconscious undercurrents in my thinking to examine; beliefs about myself, what I deserve and what I'm capable of. I'd like to think that everybody has those same 'arrangements' they've made with themselves with which to contend. It's helpful to be honest about these agreements and beliefs. Otherwise, those beliefs, whether they reflect the truth or not or even our best interests or not, will alter thinking in such a way that it will be impossible to make a success with this or any other endeavor. It simply cannot be done. Nobody can go against their beliefs for very long. They are intrinsic to who we think we are; to go against them, whether they serve us well or not, is to bring about a sense of self-destruction. My trading, right now, is actually showing me what I believe about myself. That's where I'm at and it's a kind of middle ground - a neutral zone between success and failure. I imagine I won't be seeing much growth in my account until this is rectified...so for God's sake, don't follow any trades I make! It's likely to be a crap shoot! But getting back to the method, I have noticed over the years of my 'thread surfing,' that no matter what the method is, there are, generally, only a few who can actually use it with any efficacy on a long-term basis. It speaks to them somehow. It becomes a part of them because it's conducive to who they are and their natural inclinations. They "get it" because it virtually gets in their bones. There's an intrinsic understanding going on there; an understanding that has built a sustainable confidence. This thread hasn't been up that long and I've posted a LOT of examples to study. Not only have I posted examples, I've discussed at length the philosophy behind all of it. While 'simple,' this method really has a lot to it in that I think there are ways to improve timing and risk management. It's a bit like Elliott Wave in that there's a price structure underpinning everything and a logical reason behind it. Then there's the cyclical aspect and a timing component. There's a lot going on with the two indys on the charts and then of course there's the multiple TFs that all nest together. It's actually a lot to take in, but the more I do this, the fewer surprises I find in the markets. Because I've been posting so much, it's helped me to integrate it into my thinking. (Thank you again for reading them. It's been a great motivator for my thoughts.) I believe that there is more to this than I have been able to find. It's still a wide-open set of potentials that are yet to be discovered. I hope people to whom this speaks will help discover things with me and share their thoughts too. I'm going to stop posting for awhile because it's time for me to focus on my execution and mindset. Plus I will be on a retreat until March 3rd. However if anybody wants to post something or has as question, I will check in a few times a day. Oh...and that retreat I'm going to deals extensively with unconscious beliefs My wife went to it last Summer and loved it. Definitely a life-changer! http://www.choose-again.com/home/

--- 帖子 #225 ---
It definitely seems to me that there are a lot of (uncovered?) posibilities with what you so kindly offered here - unique stuff! I hope to find some step-wise approach so I can trade this. I need a "structure" of some kind. After all, if we can get some nice statistics trading only a 2:1 ratio - that's all we need, isn't it? Maybe even adding some other "cycle" system like Brooky's KST, who knows, I am looking at that. Wish you a nice retreat - time!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I totally agree with you Go5, I am trying to work out some easy methodological approach to trading this. may be even add a third HAC line on the same chart from another timeframe? (What do you think Almuten?), Then all I want to do is quickly scan the 4H bars at the end of every 4 hour period and see any potential coming up, like all three lines starting to line up etc. Then place a trade, stop in place and as you said 2X is plenty enough if this works more than 75% of the time, then walk away and not even bother watching the trade develop. Simple! Ha, I wish. I have always loved the idea of cycles in the market, and Almuten, I really like your unique approach to this, thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks Almuten, I really like the way you are posting. There are many examples to properly learn I think. I just am occupied at work and testing my daily strategy, once that is finished, this thread is pinned in Chrome for that time Have a nice time till March.

I'm Back! After a week away I got some clarity (or at least I think I did) on how to deal with this methodology. On one hand, if somebody was to 'specialize' in just one or two markets, this method has a lot to recommend itself. On the other hand though, looking for trade setups is a real pain when dealing with many markets. There's just too much to analyze because in a way, it gives almost too much information. Originally my intention was to locate areas where major reversals happen and to 'stack' TFs on top of one another in order to get the tightest trade with the highest probability possible. I think I've done that, yet there's just so much temptation to over complicate the issue with other things. So now my goal is to go back to the goal of making as many trades as possible rather than analyzing markets to death. I did a few things: 1. I did a risk of ruin calculation and determined that if the payoff ratio is 4:1 (I will show how this can be achieved) and the probability of success is 33% or greater, then the risk of ruin is zero. So far, I've seen no evidence that anything close to a 33% success rate will occur. If all the rules are followed, the rate of success will be far greater. The graph below shows the equity curve of trading a $500 account and taking a 2% risk on each trade. The probability is set to a 40% success rate, but this is very, very conservative. Profits are not put back into the account. This is only to show what happens if the risk amount is the same for a static amount of money. In my judgment, the equity curve is pretty smooth and can be mentally handled pretty well.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
2. Next, I recognized that the best trades have two things that tend to be true: First, that where the green HAC line is crossed tends to hold and not be revisted. Second, that the green HAC on the higher TF tends to be crossed during the same period that the red HAC on the lower TF gets crossed. Calculating the risk portion from the point where the green HAC on the higher TF gets crossed to the place where the red will be crossed is a lot better than using the prior swing low or high. It cuts the pips in half most of the time, which allows for a greater position size. The truly good trades will always move away quickly. If they don't, then it's generally better to just be out of it and on to the next one. The advantage to approaching it in this way is that prior to a position taken on the H1 example below, there is already a good M15 trade in progress and thus, greater confidence that the H1 will actually succeed.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
3. Finding the 4:1 payoff Another thing I recognized is that there will be some situations where the risk will be too great relative to the payoff. My goal is to find situations of the highest likelihood for a 4:1 payoff and I want them as quickly as possible. A good way to find this out is to put on the x levels. If a 3x target can meet or exceed a 4:1 payoff, then it's a great trade. The best ones will offer 10:1 sometimes. But to find the likelihood of that 3x being hit, move to the next higher TF and see if when it's green HAC was penetrated, the red HAC on the TF you're trading was penetrated also. If so, then that means the "stars have aligned," so to speak. 4. Trailing Stops In order to keep this as simple as possible and the 'analysis' out of it as much as possible, there's a way to simplify it. a. Once the 1x is achieved, then the stop moves to breakeven b. Once 2x is achieved, then the stop is moved to 1x (this will generally secure a 2:1 on the risk) c. Once a 4:1 payoff is accomplished, then trail the stop above/below the last heiken-ashi bar. The first ("a") will actually pare down the losing trades considerably. There are times when things seem to align and then suddenly peter out and reverse the other way. Generally though, trades will hit at least a 1x before doing so. Again, the best trades (and this method is designed to find them) will take off right away, blow through 1x and at least up to 2x before having a correction of any depth. If after a 1x is hit, then it ought not to return back to the point of entry. If it does, then it means the market is not doing as expected. If that's the case, why be in it?

Hi Almuten, thanks for sharing your strategy. I discovered it yesterday and studying it. I have a simple question: in your opinion, is it fine to trade indices (intraday)? In such case, I like European indices (EuroStox, German Dax,etc ) and their opening time is 14 hours/day (they are not 24/24). Since your system is strongly based on cycles, do you think it (indicators) should be consequently 'fitted' to this shorter trading time? Thanks Giacomo

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Welcome back Almuten! Question is, how would you know that the green HAC will hold and not be revisited? What about when the price is ranging and crossing the HACS back and forth, how would you know when the price will take off? Because I tend to keep an eye on only a few markets, and ranging happens a lot, but then the price just takes off, and I miss it!

--- 帖子 #239 ---
You'll have no argument from me over that one! But hey, if what you're doing is working, then by all means keep doing it

--- 帖子 #240 ---
That's a good question jack-fx and one I don't have an answer for. I used to trade the Nasdaq &amp; S&amp;P indices but have not testing this on them yet. Since I live in the U.S., I can't trade those so I've concentrated on currencies only. But since cycles are only a small part of the underlying theory, it might work well on those too. Years ago when I was trading the S&amp;P, the idea of profit targets based on aggregate risk worked well (but I did not use anything like I'm using now back then). To my mind, the idea ought to hold. It might even work better if the trading hours were limited because the hours of listless chop will be more limited.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi Timo, The short answer: Nothing is ever certain. The long answer would be to look to the lower TFs and see how they're faring. For instance, when the M1 triggered, how many periods until the M5 triggered? Then how many periods before the M15? Next, is the green HAC on the H1 very close in price to the red on M15? If it's close or right on it, there will be H1 support/involvement. Same for the H1 red - how close is the H4 green? If it's close, then there will be H4 involvement and so on. So let's say that you're interested in trading an H1 and the green line has just been crossed or is in the process of crossing. Look to the lower TFs and see what's going on. If it all looks good and tight and the M15 has plenty of room to 3x, the chances of H1 taking off sharply is very great - especially if the RAC is confirming or will realistically confirm it in the near future. If it's buried one way or the other (like flat above 90 or below 10), then it's likely going to come back on you. But I think this would be rare if the lower TFs are showing strong movement and the HAC lines are lined up from one TF to another. The H1 red gets crossed an average of 11 times per month across all markets. Not all of them are great moves (obviously), but most of the bad ones can get filtered out by looking at the factors mentioned above. Many pairs trigger together or very close together as well. Generally there will be a leader among them and often they make identical patterns in the indicators. The HAC lines will make the same shapes and so on. This can be useful as well because when major currency rotations occur, there's less chance of them jacking around.

Hi Timo, I would advise you on a couple of things with this pair because although it could work out, trading D1 might be a rocky road. The first chart below is an H1. It has hit a 4x profit level and lots of times markets have to have a retracement afterwards. It sort of has already so that might be ok. The next chart is a W1. On that chart the RAC is very strong still. Even the RSI is against the ceiling. Plus the green HAC on W1 is a long ways from being matched up with the red on D1. This generally means that the market will futz around until the longer TF catches up. If the trade does go in your favor, it will probably stop at the green HAC line or near it on the W1 chart. This also matches the 4x level from the H4 chart (I put those on the W1 chart for convenience) - but be mindful of the 3x on H4 because on average, the market will stop and reverse in those places. I would not use a D1 profit target because it will take the W1 to be in alignment with it in order to get it past 1x or 2x. Use instead the H4 levels because the D1 green matched the H4 red pretty closely. On the D1, the RAC broke below 80 but the market was not touching the red HAC line at the time, which is an argument for a revisitation toward the original break area prior to moving down further. [edit] I guess this one is iffy...but one good thing is that when the green HAC was penetrated, the RSI shot down. This is generally a very good sign that the cross on the red HAC will produce something. If the market is in just a pullback mode prior to the resumption of an upward move, the M15-M1 will tip you off. If those TFs align and go long, then I would get out because it will indicate further upside - perhaps much further.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I too am working on some kind of 'step-wise' approach, like a screener of some sort. I'm currently tracking about 12 markets and I think (or would like to think) that the highest probability ones can be ferreted out. I did do something like that last year with Forexalien's method in that I had about 22 different variables I weighed over 3 different TFs. Bullish vs bearish factors were calculated and then I looked for the top 5 out of 21 markets that showed strongest biases either way...but it was exhausting! It worked pretty well though. Anyway, I'm working on the D1 chart to start out with and am working on weighing the RAC lines first - both the green shorty and the regular one. The pitch, changes in pitch, level position and spread between them and their averages are being evaluated. But this is the momentum component only. The next phase will be the HAC lines - whether or not the price is touching them, are they moving further away or closer together, etc... If I come up with something fruitful I'll post it here, but it will be in Excel. I'm not skilled enough to program anything too sophisticated.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
HAC Open Code I think I might have an idea to help know how many TFs are involved with a given pair. This might be very useful because as we've seen before, markets don't generally turn hard one way or the other until the HAC lines on the longer TFs come into contact with the HAC lines on the shorter. Even on an M1 chart that's racing to the moon will sit and wait for the M5 to catch up before making a sizable retrace. I had FerruFX program my indys, but I did manage to do one of them myself (I checked it with his work to be sure it matched and it does perfectly). I can hardly believe I pulled it off. Anyway, if I offer it here, my hope is that somebody might create some kind of comparison indy - like comparing the green H4 to the red H1, etc.... This indicator also has the capability of plotting in the future by at least a few bars because it's calculated with displaced moving averages, but I don't know how to get it to take the values that I know exist and get them to plot ahead. It should be capable though (see post #2). It's useful to know when the green HAC on, say, H4 will intersect the red on H1. Changes in trend often occur when this happens, especially after an extended run. At any rate, it's good to know the future just a little bit. Anyway, if anybody wants to take a stab at this, have at it!

Thanks Almuten, I'm not a coder but would hope to be. I learnt machine language in college, but thats about all. Any way, what does the Alpha 0.07 mean. I think I know what the multiplier does, but why do you have it at 0.382? I would have thought it would be 0.250, for the lower time frame. I tried putting a higher time frame HAC line on also, but I'm not sure if it actually helps. May be wait until all three lines come together and price crosses them at the same time like in the screen shot. But that doesn't happen very often so cleanly! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hey Timo, The alpha, if I remember right, shortens or lengthens the cycle. Mathematically, what happens is that Elher's formula makes a 'circle'. The alpha, I believe, is a smoothing function that makes the circle bigger or smaller. Elhers leaves the alpha at .07 so that's what I do. Anyway, the circle is then cut in half, which is the cycle length. I'm not 100% certain about all this because it's been a few years since I've studied his material, but I think that's the gist of it. You can play around with it and see if it helps to adjust anything. With regard to the .382 instead of .25, I put it there because .25 can be too short and the indy gets pretty wonky if the cycle is too short. What it's doing is taking the cycle period length, whatever it is, and then taking 38% of it. It happens to mimic the next lower TF red HAC pretty well when things are getting ready to turn. And this doesn't need to be exact to be useful. The main issue is to make sure that the longer TF is within range to participate in a reversal formation. Btw, can you share what you made? I'm curious how you did that!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thanks Almuten for those explanations, all I did was try to put the next higher TF HAC on screen, but back testing and looking at different markets I don't think it is that useful. Probably the most useful thing I have found is just to scan the markets on the 4H TF, and see if any one is crossing the green and red HAC roughly about the same time, and then check the 1H, and 15M to see if the same thing is happening. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hey Timo, I think that's a sound strategy. Generally if the green HAC on H4 is being crossed, the red HAC on H1 will be crossed also. If it is, this shows great alignment and a high-probability of working out. This is true of smaller TFs as well. Generally, this works well but sometimes, especially if a triangle pattern, a lengthy topping or bottoming formation or other difficult scenario is forming, the HAC lines will not line up that well.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Rudimentary Screener? Last May I started developing an idea that seemed to have merit but it didn't address other concerns so I tabled it. It's very simple but appears to be effective. Anyway, it gives the general market condition relative to the previous day's activity by drawing a trend line from yesterday's open to halfway into today. The trend line ends one half into today's session at the level of the opening price. See below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This can be done in mathematically in Excel for all markets and monitored accordingly. In the example below, the columns in red are markets that are currently below the trend line and those in green are above it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) With great moves markets move together so I also made a little tool that keeps track of each currency relative to the others. It's probably a bit like a currency strength meter only this calculates relative to the trend line. In this example there's a column showing the % of the pairs that are being traded against that are up and down. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next example shows what sort of trade is either in progress or is beginning to happen. When it says "Reversal", it means that the market has moved in the opposite direction of its trend line. "Check H&amp;R!" means to take a look at the chart and see if the HAC &amp; RAC is giving a signal because the market is close to crossing the trend line. This is pretty early in development and I want to make some finer adjustments, but this is the direction I'm going in I think. Attached Image Finally, just for kicks, I track each market in terms of points. I also grouped them by geography and track them by points as well. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Anyway, to update this each day takes around 5 minutes or less. I just put in the new open for the day and it's all done automatically. Trying to keep it as simple as possible is the goal. It's so much easier to watch a single spreadsheet than to keep my eye on all the markets. Even monitoring a few can be difficult because some days they don't do a thing and I get tired out for nothing. Then, once exhausted the markets all of a sudden move and I'm either not ready or sleeping. In the spreadsheet I attached, the data is set for Forex.com data, which uses a 'pro' suffix. Columns B-G import the data so if you want to play around with this and don't use Forex.com, you'll have to change the suffix in those columns.

Looks good, I hope it works under wine - had some difficulties with DDE in the past... If I put 2 more HAC's on the M1 chart, say with multiplier 5 &amp; 15 I get this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Lines come together in the dark circle and off it goes, happens all the time.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Wow! That is awesome dude! See? I knew I wasn't seeing everything! It makes sense though because if you think about it, large moves happen when cycles align. I actually tried something like this but never with large multiplier numbers on the M1. I was too focused on the lager TFs. Nice work!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
What sort of difficulties did you have? Are there times when the data doesn't pull through or was it corrupted somehow? Anybody else experience this?

Hi Almuten, Please can I ask a couple of questions? First, do you take a trade if there is a setup just before red news. Secondly, please can you advise me how to alter my fib properties to show x1, x2, x3. Again, many thanks for sharing this system, looks very promising. Moonie.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Moonie, Thanks for the question. First of all, I tend to discount news but I might be persuaded to change my mind. I know, I know, news moves the market...but I'm of the mind that those who know what's going to happen have positioned themselves in advance to take advantage of it and this is revealed in the alignment of the indicators. The more certain it is, the better the alignment tends to be. Sometimes news does weird things though, like create spikes in both directions. In those cases, I'm betting that the all-important alignment wasn't there beforehand. As for the fibs, here's a screenshot of how I altered the default settings (what isn't shown is the first level, which is set at zero. The description for that says zero as well.) : Attached Image

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Something of Interest... Perhaps? I'm of the mind that if I value a thing and I want to keep it, the best thing I can do is to share it. There's power and truth in that somehow. To withhold a thing is akin to making everyone an enemy to my own interests. I value my peace of mind, which is why I want to share what I have with you. Anyway, not to confuse anybody with what I'm about to present here, what I'm going to show you is more for educational purposes; it's to show you how much deception really exists in the market and why what the eyes see is merely there to obfuscate the intentions of those who move them. I've hinted (strongly) that markets are manipulated. Many will refuse to believe it because they're scared enough already. Even so, it's better to acknowledge it and deal with it accordingly than to hope that somehow the playing field will level itself and give everyone a fair shot. In the screenshot below you'll see a white line and an orange line. This is an indicator you've never seen before (at least I'm pretty sure you never have) or even heard about. It's not based on price movement at all. What it is, is purely numerical. It measures the frequency of numbers; their occurrence over a given period of time. In this example, when the white line dipped below the orange and then recrossed above it, a line was drawn. The next day, when the same thing happened, the market was in exactly the same place as before, but a huge move ensued shortly afterwards. There is a reason for it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If left to themselves, without manipulation, markets would indeed be totally random. There are times when this is certainly the case, but there are also times when large players step in and bump them this way or that; they leave such a large numerical footprint they can't hide completely. On the surface all the market activity looks the same, but if we peer below it just a little bit, there is another story. I think you'll enjoy hearing it

--- 帖子 #257 ---
What it is... This indicator is set up to measure two numbers - the number 1 and the number 4. The basis of the calculation is as follows: The leading digit of: Range x volume. The frequency of leading digits is taken from 48 periods on an M5 chart - or one H4 bar. In a completely random situation, the number one will occur roughly 31% of the time. The number 4 will occur only 9% of the time - a huge difference! In the indicator, the white line is the measurement of #1; the orange is the measurement of #4. Having them cross would be a pretty low probability indeed if things were random. In this example, after that huge run was made, the lines recrossed and a horizontal line was drawn in the place they did so. See how it became resistance and then support? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've said before that I like to find "statistical events." Well having an unlikely distribution of leading digits certainly qualifies in my book!

What it's called About three years ago I ran across a principle of mathematics that I found intriguing. Look it up under "Benford's Law." It's often used to ferret out fraud, so I figured that it ought to work in some way on the currency markets. Haha! It took about two years to figure out how best to make use of it though. Anyway, this is a calculation hog so those with low power computers could get frustrated by it. It takes a while to get it loaded so be patient. There's a lot going on in it. FerruFX programmed it for me, btw. He's great at making my crazy ideas into a reality. Plus I trust him. Anyway, I've at times put this on an H1 chart and marked the places where crosses happened and then maybe a month or two later those places get revisited and bounce cleanly off of them. There's something to this. Anyway, it helped me to see, truly see, the market in a new way. It gave me an insight that I didn't have before and began to bring a sense of orderliness from what seemed to be random noise before. Below is an H1 chart that spans several months. Point A established resistance for Point C. The place of Point B was revisited at Point D for another Benford cross. Weird, huh? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I don't mean to distract anyone from the original endeavor of working out the HAC &amp; RAC method, but only to show that there's a hidden agenda at work here, which is why things like alignment are important. Plus, this might actually make a decent trading filter for somebody who might take a shine to it. Anyway, here's the indy and a template that will make it easier to set up if anybody wants to play around with it.

Fun with M1 Just for shits &amp; giggles I'm going to put on an M1 chart of NZDUSD for the start of February. The periods are set to 60 in order to catch the H1 manipulation cycles. Oh...and the key to this is to do something sensible. On the M5 I put on 48 periods in order to capture the H4 manipulation. Plus, 48 periods is an ample enough of a sample size to obtain statistical reliability (or as much as a market could be deemed 'reliable.') When these manipulation cycles occur, the key question to ask is "Why here?" Of particular importance is when the cycle repeats in the same location several times. It can be the sign of a large campaign; a slow accumulation/distribution that sometimes lasts several days prior to a large move happening. The start of the month is always a good thing because many times the high or low for the whole month begins there. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On Feb 3rd, the market bounced from the levels of Feb 1st &amp; 2nd and then made a new level further up, which was made again on the 4th in the exact same place. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Feb 5th the market made a spike high above the level made the previous day and then toward the end of the day, new cycles formed; likely profit-taking places. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Feb 8th is the start of a new week. These are generally important because they can set the key level for the entire week. The market will often play off of the first levels of the week prior to establishing a sustained direction. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This next chart shows the support &amp; resistance already established. New cycles formed in the same areas as the prior ones. That's why I didn't draw any new lines. Attached Image (click to enlarge) At any rate, this is (for me) a fun thing to do. It gives me some context of where the big players are interested. If a person isn't interested in keeping track of a bunch of TFs like I do and would like to play the M1, this is a great way to do it IMO.

Great, thanks for the quick response Almuten. Many green pips to you.

Hi Almuten, Thank you for sharing your idea. You give some hope to some of us for a better life than job 9-18. For quite a long time I was looking for a system which I feel comfortable with. The most effective, simple and practical, I discovered to be yours and scalpeur's (he has a journal on ff, with bollinger bands - his BBs 100, 360 and 720 proved to be extremely powerful as dynamic support and resistance). I suggest you have a look, maybe it gives you some ideas: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=447470 . He is a great trader. Recently I started to test live this combined system (only trade EJ; 2 charts M1 &amp; M5 as per your system for entry; plus 6 charts M1,M5,M15,M30,H1,H4 as per scalpeur's system to watch out for the price hitting one of the bands in any timeframe, for exit). This is what works best for me, scalping on M1&amp;M5 and I got used with the bbs, although I really believe you a great system with the exits too. I had great results from the trades in which I sticked to your entry rules and exited when price was hitting a band that was going in the opposite direction. Unfortunately I discovered in practice that I have a very strong lack of discipline, entering trades before entry rules were fully checked, or not exiting on time when price hits the bands and reverses the price direction. Due to this bad habit, usually my SLs are hit. I know what the issue is, and I hope to overcome it..in theory it should not be so difficult to enforce discipline, but in practice it seems. The problem with trading only one pair, although it has its advantages, is when price does not move significantly for a long time, enters a range and mistakes are easy to make. So I was really enthusiastic to see your post. However I was not able to make the excel work, because I don't know where to place it, it asks for mt4.exe and my platform for example uses a file labeled 'terminal.exe' (which is placed in the same folder as the DDE-Sample.xls mentioned by Go5 - at least I think that is the one). Could you please help with this? Best regards, Dragos

[quote=dragos_;8810505]{quote} Hi Almuten, Thank you for sharing your idea. You give some hope to some of us for a better life than job 9-18. Hi dragos, I appreciate the optimism with regard to my methodology. I'm not a 'great trader' as yet; just a guy that's working away at developing his approach. Sharing is my way of teaching myself and focusing my mind toward perfecting it. Everyone here has been a big help in that regard and I'm very grateful for that. I'll take a look at scalpeur's methodology. Who knows? It might spark a few ideas or pull together some incongruities...but I'm resistant to adding anything more. Trying to keep it simple is the watchword and despite my best efforts, this thing I'm doing can get complicated if I let it. Just two indys provide so much information that adding more might prove to be overwhelming. As to getting the Excel to work, did you try to change the suffix that I mentioned? The formulas in question are on the "Input" page in columns B thru G. My broker uses "pro" as a suffix and this could be a problem for you. Also, you can probably copy and paste everything one page at a time into the sample spreadsheet you mentioned or just move/copy the whole tab into that sample. When I did mine, I used a working spreadsheet that was done by somebody else because I didn't know how to get the data into it either As to your 'lack of discipline,' I've learned not to fight myself too hard on this because the issue is not discipline with trading; it's discipline in the mind in general. Yet how can discipline in the mind be accomplished without a firm footing? What in life is consistent enough to build such discipline upon? Not long ago I went to a retreat workshop that helped me discover deeply held beliefs I had about myself; beliefs that governed the way I perceived everything. I spent 5x more money on that than on funding my trading account because I knew that unless I healed myself, there was no way I could make a success of this, regardless of how good a method might be. Anyway, I discovered that beliefs are like hidden programs in the subconscious mind that run - like an EA, only these made me lose! Not being in touch with those underlying beliefs has proved to be quite self-destructive and attempts to fight them head-on made them even more powerful. They have the ability to literally scramble the mind into a state of chaos and in-coherency when I least expected it, which made it difficult to impossible to truly trust myself enough to operate in my own best interests. It's a very subtle thing, but all-pervasive. I'm finding that the best thing to do by way of disciplining my mind is to simply love everybody all the time, regardless of what they do or not do. This takes more discipline than any other response because there's only one way to respond to any situation. The ego wants more options than that and is resistant because the ego is a collection of fictitious beliefs about myself - all hellbent on my destruction. Love and forgiveness will undo those fictions. Anyway, I find that the quicker I forgive offenses, the quicker my sanity returns and the clearer my mind becomes. Moreover, refraining from judgment of others has also proved to be effective in eliminating unconscious guilt - which will seek out its own punishment eventually. Plus the fear goes away, which is a good thing for a trader. Living like that has made me see that I'm more than I ever thought I could be...and so is everyone else, whether they realize it or not.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Well how did you put that shading in then? I'm puzzled!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
very surprised. all that I manage is m1.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
... Ignored Thank you very much for your advice. I believe there is wisdom in your words, with respect to the ego..I will actually try to work on this. Regarding the technical question, just in case other people have the same problem that I had: I did some research on the net and found out that the DDE connection has to be enabled in order for excel to work To do this, one has to go to Tools-Options-Server tab and check "Enable DDE server". Then if one just types MT4|bid!EURUSD in an excel cell (or with -PRO, if his broker has this suffix) he will get the data. So my issue was not about the placement of the file, or about calling an mt4.exe file, but about connection excel - metatrader. However at this time I get "N/A", and I presume it is becasue is weekend and the markets are closed. I also tried to export some data from mt4 (from Tools-History center) but the exported file was empty, probably due to the weekend as well. So I will wait for Monday. Best regards, Dragos

Hi Team, I've managed to get the spreadsheet working. Just need to know which column to put the new open price in. Column 'I' and 'J' on tab 'Input' are 'Yesterdays Open' and 'Today's Open'. Do I move today's open (J) into yesterdays open (I) and then put the new open price into today's open (J). Hope that makes sense. Moonie.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hey Moonie, What I do when a new day begins is to cut the contents of column J and paste them into column I. Then I put in the new values for the day. So you did it right!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hey dragos, Thanks for posting that! I completely forgot about telling people to enable the DDE server in MT4.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thanks Almuten, I think I might have an indicator which shows the daily open that I can copy and paste. Or maybe there's a web site where I could link the data from directly. I'll investigate. Very kind of you to share this, superb.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
It's Coming Together... but here's how it came I think it's important for you to understand how all this is coming together. Every time I share something, all of a sudden, I understand what it was for and how to use it. It amazes me every time! I will be posting how to use the Benford analysis to its full effect either today or tomorrow. It's blown my mind. I've been working on this methodology for quite a long while and put in many, many joyful hours testing this and then that, etc... But the way it came to me was something of a miracle in itself. I felt like I was being guided by a higher Intelligence. Every time I would get discouraged, "It" kept encouraging me to press on; indicating that it would be worth it if only I didn't give up. One might even say it's been a path to enlightenment of sorts. Anyway, like I said a few posts back, I've endeavored to keep my mind clear. The more I could do so, the better I "heard" that Intelligence. My first encounter with it in the trading arena was in 1998. Once in awhile something would come over me and more or less, tell me what to trade and whether to go long or short. And always...ALWAYS, it was an absolute monster of a trade - to the point of being overwhelming. I didn't have the faith to listen to it though. After hearing that 'voice' over and over (about three years worth of this) and seeing the utter reliability of it, I decided to finally act on it the next time it happened. I mean, it was so annoying how reliable it was that I couldn't ignore it anymore. On April 19, 2001 the Nasdaq futures were going down hard all day long - just a steady stream of selling pressure. I wasn't in a position (so common back then because I was scared out of my wits most times). Then I noticed unusual volume and tick patterns - my eye just picked up on them after staring at charts for years - and had this extremely strong intuition to go long. I looked at my trading partner and said, and I kid you not, "I think God is telling me to go long right now." There was absolutely no technical basis for it at all - NONE. Of course he thought I was nuts, but I went long close to the bottom tick. Within 5 minutes Alan Greenspan's face appeared on CNBC and announced a surprise 50 basis point reduction in interest rates. This was in early 2001. Remember what the Nasdaq was like back then? That thing would move so fast that the fills would be 50 points from my intended entry ($5000 per contract). Within 15 seconds, that market moved 450 points up. (Too bad I didn't trade my full margin!) It was a very, very good day indeed Imagine the impression that made upon me at the time though. Here I was, doing all sorts of technical analysis, etc... and that "Voice" knew stuff I could never know on my own. Problem was, I was partly afraid of it and so couldn't trust it, even though it had always been benevolent and never once steered me into a wall. I wanted to trust it. I really did. I just couldn't do it. Plus, I didn't know how that would actually work in practice. I mean, what do I do? Just sit around all day and wait for God or whatever to tell me what to do? That would never work. I was in a quandary for sure.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Well, thanks Almuten, very interesting, please keep on sharing!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Unrelated but Congruent As this progresses on, I'm beginning to see how there's actually three methodologies at work. Each of them addresses different things. The thread began with the HAC &amp; RAC and by itself, it does pretty well. But there's room for doubt and the lines can get a bit hard to watch, especially when in a listless market or consolidation pattern. Plus it's hard to know which market to focus on at any given time. So there's really two remaining problems: 1. Finding objectivity midst the "noise" 2. Locating the most probable high-movers I'm in the process of perfecting the Excel portion of this in that I've added a few things that require further development before I post a new version. I think it's going to turn out to be a 'whale hunter' in the end. I calculated that if I can find the highest probability of a market moving 100+ pips and trade only half my available margin on those markets, the returns are beyond belief. But for now, I want to turn to the Benford. So far, nobody's really commented on it and it might be because people don't understand why I developed this. I made it for a reason. I paid a fair amount of money for the indys and spent close to 3,000 hours testing it because I could see there was efficacy there. I just couldn't figure out how best to harness it into something useful for trading until now. In the story I told in my prior post, I related an incident where I saw unusual tick &amp; volume patterns in the Nasdaq futures. Those patterns were caused by people who knew, well ahead of time, what was about to occur. This is likely true of all news events in one way or another. Either there are people on the 'inside' or a firm does so much of its own research that it already knows what's about to be announced. When I first heard of Benford, my mind immediately hearkened back to April 19, 2001. I felt an inner joy I can't describe. That's where I was feeling guided so I started a pretty lengthy research project in that direction. For a long time I felt like I was beating my head against a wall because while it was obvious the markets responded to those levels, there was no way to know for sure how to trade from them. The information didn't seem any better than any other information from other indicators. Now it all makes sense

--- 帖子 #279 ---
You do so much more You're wellcome!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Benford Lesson #1 First let me begin by asking you to believe one particular aspect. This is something you can do your own research on in order to prove the efficacy of it, but if you don't want to go to that trouble, you can simply take my word for it. I used to run experiments of this kind on the expenses my last employer had and it worked to the tee. The basic premise here is that the leading digit in a naturally-occurring set of numbers will have the following distribution: Attached Image When I decided to pursue working with this phenomenon in the currency markets, it was obvious that using the first digit of each closing price was not going to work because it seldom changes. Something else, naturally-occurring, had to be measured. That's why I opted to use the range of each bar instead. I did this for about a year and then realized, through other research on Benford, that the range ought to be multiplied by the volume as well. I know this seems like some freaky shit, but after seeing it over and over for years, I know there's something to it. It works on all markets, which is another reason why the efficacy is there. By the time I'm finished explaining this, I believe you'll see it as plainly as I do.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Benford Lesson #2 At first I only used the #1 because it was the most prevalent and moved around the most. I began by seeing what would happen if the #1 got really far away from its ideal level of 31.8% but it was not clear enough to trade from. Oftentimes when it did reach and stay close to its 'ideal level' of 31.8%, the market would just stop moving. But this told me something as well. It told me that without "big money" and highly dominant players overtaking the the "natural order," markets will not move much. We need these folks. Problem is, they expertly mask their operations. You will NEVER see their actions in the volume or in anything else. That's how good they are. Make no mistake. They are the BEST at what they do. They spend millions of dollars on salaries, the most powerful computers and the brightest and best minds in order to maintain an edge. Whatever you think you see of them is because they want you to see it. God bless em! I don't know who these heavy hitters are. It could be various banks, large hedge funds or whatever. The "who" isn't important. What is important is that these folks invest enough capital to obliterate the "natural order" of the markets. The capital outlay must be considerable indeed! It would have to be in the billions. We want to trade on the same side they do. Their capital outlay is considerable; therefore, their reasons for putting on positions where they do are considerable as well. Let them do some of our work for us. Let's use their research and opinions. Finding the Ideal Extremes Since the distribution of numbers are seldom at their ideal levels, another means of finding "unlikely events" had to be found. There had to be a reliable, yet frequent enough of an event to be of use. This is why I finally landed on the intersection of #1 and #4. Recall earlier (and in the chart in the previous post), that the #4 should occur around 9% of the time. To have #1 and #4 intersect is a very unlikely event. Either #4 has to increase by 22%, or over 200% its normal distribution, or #1 has to decrease its normal distribution by roughly 72%.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Benford Lesson #3 Here are questions... very important questions to ask yourself at all times: The first one is: 1. If I had a billion dollar position to put on and it would take me at least a few hours to accomplish it undetected, what would my strategy be? This leads to the second &amp; third questions 2. Could I hope to get the bottom or top tick on the whole thing? 3. Should I buy close to where I think the bottom is or sell close to where I think the top is? Once the position is on and has run for a bit, questions 2 &amp; 3 present themselves once again in a different form: 4. Could I hope to take profits on the bottom or top tick on the whole thing? 5. Should I take profits and buy close to where I think the bottom is or sell close to where I think the top is? Remember, these folks have a huge task ahead of them. They think in terms of overall context and can't afford to be overly concerned about precise tops &amp; bottoms. Remember, THEY move the market. They ARE the liquidity. There IS nobody else to take the other side of their entire position. It has to be spoon-fed into the market. Learn to think in these terms. It's important.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Example #1 GBPJPY In the chart below the GBPJPY had gone just past a 3x target from H1 after a considerable run up. There was also a 1-4 cross and recross. Once the white line (#1) starts to move up and away from the orange (#4), I consider the trading program to have completed. Wherever it completed is where a new key level will be established. It will often be "masked" in one way or another, but if the other HAC &amp; RAC rules are followed and considered, you will not be fooled. Bear this in mind: These large players MUST get people to take the other side of their trades. Therefore, they will go with the tide if possible. Remember always what the HAC lines represent. They are various moving averages, which are the tides of the market. The RAC is the momentum toward one side of the tide or the other. By themselves, they are reliable, but now we can see where the liquidity really is. Do you think this big trader activity is toward the long side? Not a chance! What fool would put billions into a market that's already moved? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Example #2 GBPJPY A few hours later there was another crossing. Look where it is! Right on the red HAC line. Also, the RAC is giving a picture-perfect signal.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Example #3 GBPJPY Now that a short trade is underway, we look to where the big guys might be starting to take profits. It's unlikely they're putting on long positions because they like to have a little momentum on their side first. They like the market to move around in confusing patterns and get in as close to their intended level as possible. Anyway, the first recross happened very close to a 2x level, which was profit taking for sure. The second cross happened close to the 3x level - a level that will not likely be surpassed. With the liquidity gone, how far can it really go? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Example #4 GBPJPY There was yet another cross just a few pips above the 3x level. This happens to coincide with a major swing low on the H4 chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I realized something pretty important. It's possible that the recrossings of the Benford indicate more positions being put on. They occurred in the same place that the HAC line on H4 was crossed. It gave a perfect signal, so let's be sure not to go long until there are good signals from the HAC &amp; RAC telling us to do so. Where I circled is where the crossings happened on M1 and the H4 HAC line. Now because H1 has reached a major profit target, the market might have to swing back &amp; forth a bit before it heads down more. Or, if it does reverse and go up, the H&amp;R will let us know. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hey Moonie, Here's an indy I got some time ago. It shows the daily open. I used it a lot to experiment with the trendline approach I mentioned a while back.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Example #6 GBPJPY There's something big going on here boys. Keep your eye on this area. Several crosses in the same area generally means some kind of position-building. Plus it's really "quiet." Those are the best. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #289 ---
So you think it's best to find the Benford crossings on the M1 chart if your trading the H1 chart? What about if your trading the H4 chart, should we look for Bedford crossings on the M5 charts? Same with Daily, Should we look for Bedford crossings on a lower time frame? And what settings for the should we use for the Period 1, Period 2, range multiplier, range divisor should we use for a lower TF chart?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Good questions Timo! I'm glad you asked these because I want to underscore again what's being measured. We're looking for places where the biggest money is doing something significant. Their 'programs' will have a beginning and an end. With that said, we have to consider a couple of things: 1. Sample size - there has to be enough periods to obtain an adequate numerical sample. 2. Time - The actual time, in terms of minutes/hours has to be short enough to capture the effects of their buying/selling. Too long of a time will obscure it IMO. Personally, I like M1 over M5 because it shows multiple hits in the same area. M5 oftentimes does a 'touch n go" and that's it. It's just easier to see on M1. At significant levels though, they occur together. Usually, when M1 has multiple hits in the same area, there will be an M5 anyway. Bear in mind that those market participants aren't interested in grabbing just a few pips. These are significant moves that are under development - ones that easily run for days. With regard to the settings, use the template I provided. It's set up to put two instances of the indy into one window. Also, the scaling is adjusted to match up both instances. I think the template I gave is set to 48 periods (ideal for M5), but if you use an M1 chart, set period 1 to 60 on both instances. Here's what the settings actually do: Reference: This is a selection to either use the range, volume, or range x volume. Use range x volume. Period 1 : This sets the number of periods for the sample. Period 2: This is a second sample size to look for. (I used to compare D1 &amp; W1 sample sizes and see their relationships) - don't bother with this (the default is to have it turned off). But be careful to have it set to a very low number. Otherwise it takes an enormous amount of calculation Range Multiplier: This multiplies the range to get it out of decimals. I was afraid that if it was multiplied by the volume, it might not be right. The default is 10,000, which is high enough to accomplish this for all currencies Range Divisor: Originally I thought that some currencies might require dividing the range by a certain amount and then running the analysis on them, but this isn't the case. The default is 4, but set it to 1 . (Again, the template is set up properly) Leading Digit: This is the leading digit being looked for. The indy counts the number of occurrences. Disable_Average 2: All this does is turn on off the results of Period 2 At some point, I'll ask FerruFX to add the second leading digit and remove Period 2. That way, we will have only one instance of it running. Meanwhile, please use the template. If you use M1 though, I would change the period to 60 on both instances.

Thanks Almuten you are always so good and thorough with your explanations and answers. Wouldn't it be good if we could set up a team of us, scanning all 25 or 30 currency pairs, just looking out for these big moves!

I think it would be tremendous and a lot of fun! It will take some time and getting used to, but we'll get there.

And if we look at the chart in a form?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Now I've made some indy that shows difference between current TF red HAC and higher TF green HAC (see post #306). And Weekly Open Line. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hey vvFish, I'm not familiar with looking at a chart in a "form." Please explain. Also, I'm wondering if you're on a demo feed on the chart you displayed or maybe the scaling is different on the indys. The Benford looks a bit different. It seems to be making similar patterns to mine, but the lines aren't touching at any point in that last consolidation pattern. There should be two instances of the indy and the scaling has to be identical on both of them. Otherwise, they might never touch. I set the template to .01 for the minimum and .6 for the max.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hey Rammstein, Thanks for posting that! I will play around with it so on. I do have one question though. Is there a reason you put "2" for a level in it? I'm just wondering if there's something I don't understand about it, etc... Thanks for the contribution!

Hi, Almuten! There is no level "2", there is just level "0". I don't understand - what are you talking about. And I see just level "0" in indi window... Excuse me for my english, please. And I have to note that M60 (not M30) is higher TF for M15. The M60 is higher TF in my indy for both M15 and M30, cause I don't use M30 in my trading by this method. And, cause MN1 is highest TF, don't use Delta HAC on it. DeltaHAC helps me to see aligning of TFs. Now I wait great move on #NIKKEI, cause M15-H1-H4 are aligned (Delta HAC are about "0" on all three TFs).

Oh it's just that when I put on the indy there was a horizontal line that was set to "2" in the 'level' section of the indicator. No big deal. And besides, if it is set to '2', it would be only 2 pips, right? Btw, your English is fine

--- 帖子 #305 ---
You can set desired level in the "Levels" tab of the indicator property window. But if desired level isn't "0", then you have set three levels: "0", "+desired level", "-desired level". Then picture will be more readable. Of caurse, it's up to you. And yes, DeltaHAC measured in Points, without any conversion. By the way, DeltaHAC was built with iCustom() function, so original "HAC_v02.00_[KristopherStreeter]" indy has to be located in "Indicators" folder.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I'm so sorry... I've found bug in source code of DeltaHAC. There really was Level=2, but I didn't see it cause I trade #NIKKEI, wich hasn't decimal digits. That's why "0" and "2" levels seems like one level in indicator window, they are too close. Excuse me, please, and get fixed bug version:

What About News? I want to pose a question; perhaps one that isn't asked that often because it's such an accepted thing that a person would feel stupid for asking it. I'm trying to figure out why people care so much about the news. What do you do with it? How does it change the outlook or the decisions that have to be made? The only reason that I'm asking is that lately I've been getting comments or ideas about the news - not just from you vvFish Some people even turn off their systems when there's about to be a news announcement. Why is that? I've worked on this system for years and never once considered the news while developing it. It just didn't occur to me I guess because, back in the day, I learned that most of the news is bullshit and worthless. Trading from it was a sure way to ruin. But maybe things have changed since then? I don't know. Maybe Forex is different from every other trading instrument out there. All along my thinking on this has been that upcoming news events are for public consumption only. I can't bring myself to believe that large traders are surprised by any news announcement. That incident I related earlier about April 19,2001...now THAT was news! It surprised just about everybody - except for a few insiders that obviously positioned themselves to take advantage of it. But even that incident, as powerful as it was, could not be sustained. In his arrogance, Greenspan thought he could scare the market into another bull run, but he failed miserably and used up the few bullets the Fed had left in its arsenal. The market continued down almost immediately - that very day in fact.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks Rammstein! Btw, I'm really liking this! It often shows up and coming turning points once those cycles align with the higher TFs. I'll be playing with this a lot more! Kudos!

Guess this computer's just to old, MT froze up on loading that benford onto the template,,, . I read your post in regards to it being a resource hog a few days ago but wanted to try it anyway. Never mind I'll buy a new one soon. Went to load them last night but couldn't find the template nor indicator, solved that one though the indicator was in the template folder, Wonder who put it there Dunno where the template got to though

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Time for a Review I introduced a major thing yesterday and as with all new things, sometimes the 'old' things get forgotten in the process. Remember that locating large trader activity merely confirms the basic system. It shows where a lot of money has been invested; that money tends to both create and go with the general tide of the market. Our system is there to discover both the tide and its direction. 1. Basic signal: When a signal occurs it will cross the red HAC line at the same time the RAC either: a. crosses its own average b. crosses down through 80 or up through 20 c. late crossings from the RAC tend to cause the market to pull back to the area of the crossing of the red HAC line. It doesn't mean the trade will fail, but it generally means that the stop shouldn't be too tight. There are exceptions to this of course, but it's a good rule to be mindful of. d. when the market goes through one of the HAC lines and the RAC is nowhere near to crossing, the market will resume its original trend 95% of the time. When this occurs, there will generally be an RSI pullback trade on a higher TF e. the RSI pullback trade occurs when the RAC is buried at one extreme or the other. (The rule is if it's above 80 or below 20, but if it's above 90-99 or below 10-1, it's even better) The RSI will then hit the other extreme while the RAC is buried. The market will generally hit one of the HAC lines. The green is best for a continuation because it shows the trend is quite strong. The red is ok too, but green is best. 2. Alignment of signals: The largest and best and cleanest moves happen when there are very few periods between a signal from one TF to the next. If there are lots of periods in between, this generally indicates choppy waters ahead and perhaps even a failed trade. There are exceptions to this of course, but the next rule has a lot to do with handling those. 3. Alignment of Time Frames When the green HAC on the next highest TF is a long way from the red HAC on the TF you're trading from, it means that the higher TF will not be offering its power to the trade. They don't have to be equal, just in the general area. For an M1 to M5 for example, a few pips apart is fine. For an M5 to M15, maybe 10 pips is ok and so on. There's nothing I can be definitive about here though. It's just something that has to be 'felt.' At times it will be very obvious though - especially after very large moves - where you should wait for the longer TF to 'catch up.' 4. Profit Targets a. profit targets are drawn from the last pivot to the red HAC line where it was crossed (along with the RAC confirmation) and projected in equal increments. The ideal average target is 3x. b. for a TF to reach the 3x level or higher, it will require support from the next higher TF (see rule 3) . Otherwise, the target will be 1x or 2x. Also, profit targets from various TFs tend to overlap each other. A 2x on H1 might equal a 3x on M15 and so on. Sometimes this is good to know about because, say you have an 'unsupported H1 signal,' (meaning that the H4 alignment isn't there). This means that it will likely not hit a 3x. Instead it might go 1 or 2x. However, if the M15 is being supported by the H1, then see where the 3x and 4x are on M15. Whichever one of those is closest to the H1 x level is the one likely to be hit. c. be mindful of higher TF profit targets like H1 &amp; especially H4. Unfulfilled targets on larger TFs, when they exist, tend to cause lower TF trades to either not work out or not reach their intended profit targets. There are still decent counter trend trades, but some care should be taken to watch out for alignment on M1-M15 (see rule 2) That should do it for now

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Yeah... unfortunately a lot of my indys are real resource hogs! But in my next request to FerruFX, I might see if I can get a period limiter put on them. That way they'll run without too much trouble for most people.

It's funny, but I feel very rewarded already. At least I'm quite happy about the way this is all going. But a little $$$ would be welcomed too!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
LOL, well said Rammstein, dream big! And thanks for that summary Almuten, I am going back over charts to see occasions where the high probability trades have occurred, and see if I can get a method to be able to spot them quickly.

Taken to heart my friend!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hey Timo, I have an idea but I don't know how to get it to work. Maybe somebody with some programming skills can give it a go. I've been thinking about this problem for a while and have toyed with various ideas but here's something that could work...but , this is just to give a 'heads-up.' I don't know if it could be traded from by itself. Recall that the system is based upon one time frame nesting into another and so on. That's the whole premise behind it, right? When M1 gives a signal, the market will have moved beyond the HAC line by x number of pips. Then, when M5 gives a signal, same thing. Then M15, H1, etc... What if this were done: (Close - M1 HAC) + (Close - M5 HAC) + (Close - M15 HAC), etc... Maybe some kind of selection can be arranged to suit the trader's timeframe, like larger or smaller ones being turned off. Maybe a person wants to trade M5, so he turns on M1 thru M15 or something. Plot the thing like a histogram, shrink it down to where that's all you see of it and have a profile page that works like a screener. When something 'pops,' go look at the actual charts on another profile page. There might be an issue however with calculation speed. What makes these indys resource hogs is the ever-adjusting cycle period. However, if all we're doing is using it like a screener of some kind, then precision isn't that important. And besides, when I first began working with this, I actually used a static cycle of around 24 periods for all the TFs and it gave good signals. I couldn't calculate accurate profit targets with it being that way, but the signals were pretty good overall. I attached an indy that I used early on that might be of use if anybody wants to try this. It has none of the complex cycle calculations in it so it will calculate very fast.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I have been experimenting setting up my mt4 with 4 screens open, 5M, 15M, 1H and 4H on the one screen. It's a bit awkward though, I suppose I could save them as profiles for each instrument, and just scroll through the profiles, but still a bit cumbersome. Any one know of a better method? Your idea Almuten, of say like a table, or like a matrix board where it's scanning all pairs and all time frames is the best idea. Lets hope a programmer gets on board and decides to help out. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Create an overview profile. Open all trading instruments with the same TF, apply to them "overview template" (organize it with indicators to find "the first clue"), and tile them on the screen to see them all contemporaneously. Then you have to scan your screen to find "the first clue" and switch to the correspondent instrument profile when "the first clue" will be found. More simple is impossible, I think.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I'm doing mine pretty much like you are Timo. I have 2 27" monitors and a 42" TV for backup. It would be good though to get them all compact enough to watch at a glance.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I'm going to give that composite indicator a try. I've been doing some tests and I think I might be able to pull off something simple. I did create a histogram out of the HAC before, so maybe I can get several TFs to compile together somehow.

GBPJPY Update For those of you who've been watching this pair, it's been exciting, no? Anyway, if you were paying attention closely, you'd see that the M5 was in alignment with the M15 for that last long. It hit its 3x profit target. But because the M15 wasn't in alignment with the H1, it couldn't go farther. But here's something that I'd like to show you about this pair right now. Recall yesterday where I drew a pink box at the area where the first bit of profit taking occurred. Then I drew another one at the bottom - right at the 3x level for the H1 short. Anyway, on this last little run up, it not only hit the 3x profit level on M5, but that level was also at the first pink box drawn yesterday. I'm pointing this out because those levels, once established by trading programs or whatever, become areas of interest in the future. These guys are working this pair back &amp; forth between established zones that they themselves created.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Interesting, and there was another benford crossing about 3 hours ago. They may be busy building up a position or still profit taking maybe? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Almuten Thanx for sharing. My guess Alpha=0.07 borrowed from Pi=22/7 where 22=circle perimeter &amp; 7=circle diameter 22 is near to 24 (hours) Thus Pi numbers find their use in scaling up/down daily cycles So changing 7 should be changing cycle length by a factor of Pi=3,14(22/7). Just my guess i don't know ehler's formula though. My second guess why 0.382 multiplier instead of 0.25 fits well to represent HAC of 1H on a 4H chart is that .382 is 1.5 times of .25 and excess accommodates randomness in markets which is always present atleast 50% all the time. I saw your name in Alien's thread &amp; here you are using his RSIOMA in a way that I had wished to ...Beside you gave few things never heard of before. I want to learn your methods. I have to read it several times... Kind regards..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi Almuten, what do you think about NZDJPY? On H4 RAC went through its MA and price closed above HAC. On H1 it happend 9 bars ago. R/R on H1 is pretty low, about 1:1 tho. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Many green pips are caught. Almuten, you have to remove this thread as soon as possible... I think you know - why No need anymore, there is enough.

Thanks for that explanation! It's better than mine - that being "It just works." Please, share any other insights you might have on these matters. It's always best to have as much of a well-reasoned foundation as possible for all that we do. It builds trust in our methods.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I know what you're saying....and because you said it, you truly understand. I used to be concerned about sharing this. I even selected FerruFX to program it for me because I could trust him to keep it under wraps. I'm not worried now though. Besides, who is going to follow the words of a has-been, former painter/hack? People want to see "live success" more than learning how to think for themselves. I'm not offering live trades. It just draws too much of the wrong kind of element IMO.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Dovilo, First of all, thank you for your question. There are good reasons why these trades didn't work out, but you are going to tell us why. Refer to post 313. Read the section under "Profit Targets" - specifically under 4-b. Don't miss the opportunity to teach others from your mistakes

My God...so much to talk about with this pair, isn't there? I purposely chose this pair to use as an example because it scares the shit out of people. And that my friends, is by DESIGN. It's not called "The Beast" for nothing. Hone your skills with this pair and you'll master everything far more quickly. Nothing will frighten you from then on. Perhaps a picture will do. I highlighted in pink boxes the areas where there were Benford indications of positions being put on by large traders. If these areas are examined in light of our methodology, it will become clearer I think. I didn't put pink boxes in the last consolidation area near the lows because it would clutter things up to much. It's confusing enough - and this too is by design. Sometimes it's enough to know that "something" is going on in a given area. Use the indys and the rules of the methodology to tell you the "what."

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Perhaps that will change soon

--- 帖子 #336 ---
yeah but there's no hurry

--- 帖子 #337 ---
So, we need a confirmation from a higher time frame. If I used H1, I should have a confirmation on H4, if my primary TF is a H4, I need a confirmation on D1. Wasn't H1 chart supported by H4 chart in my example? Both were closing under the HAC (albeit ~60 pips apart) and giving signals on RAC indicator.

A Single Trade Can Change Your Life I remember when my mentor, George Lane (the inventor of stochastics) told me when he was working the grain pits of Chicago he noticed something odd. The exchange had been quiet for a long time and the big Cargill traders were seldom out of the break room. Most days they'd smoke cigarettes and drink coffee and seldom enter the pit. But then he, as he put it, "smelled something stinky" and noticed them in the pit doing what he called "sneaky buying" of wheat, corn and beans. Come to find out, there had been a secret deal with the Soviet Union with regard to exporting grain - big news for a grain trader - and nobody in the public knew about it yet. Well old George began buying along with them and even went beyond the limit the exchange allowed at that time. He made over $4 million dollars on that trade during the great bull grain market of 1972. I have my own story...although I don't think nearly as good. I've related some of my trading experiences, but one I've not told you about is how awful I did during the 'tech-bubble' of March 2000. I was trading Nasdaq futures and being a 2nd year trader with no support from anybody, I got creamed day after day. It was just me, alone, far from my small hometown for the first time, and trading another person's money. Being scared shitless, I just couldn't see clearly enough to trade well. My performance was so awful that I managed to lose 96% of my trading capital. THAT'S RIGHT - 96%. So... I was down to my 'last bullet,' so to speak. One more losing trade and that would be it for my trading career. My job, my house and, for all I knew, maybe even my marriage was on the line. Heck, the slippage on getting filled would have wiped out what I had left. Needless to say, the pressure was on...full-on. Attached Image I decided that I would treat this last trading opportunity as a 'torpedo attack.' I'd stalk the market and really, really focus. Pull out every trick in the book that I had - and there were many. For two weeks I stalked the Nasdaq, getting ready to short it. Mind you, the whole damned world was screaming "That market will NEVER go down!" Everybody was amazed at its buoyancy. It was like a magical flying carpet. All the big bears were getting their asses handed to them day after day. I placed fib-based profit targets on it from all sorts of places - found a significant cluster I thought would be good to focus on. I even used Gann's square of nine, astrology, cycles and a goodness knows what else. Like I said, I had a lot of tricks and used them all. I had a plan: It had a place and it had a day and a time. And I waited until it all lined up. http://drduru.com/onetwentytwo/wp-co...Q1999-2000.png As soon as that sonofabitch hit the exact place and time, I torpedoed it with a short...my potential last trade. Then I turned off the monitor because I needed a drink. Later that day I was relieved to find that my target was accurate to within 15 points, which was pretty darn close for a market that moved 350+ per day. Within 10 days, my account was up 98% for the year... but I swore I would never put myself through that again. Never! How Does This Relate? The fact is, when I consider what I had to do in order to find a monster trade that would've frightened almost anybody else - weeks of planning - this method we're working with is a walk in the park. I had no real rules back then. I just tried to find a confluence of indications and went with the probabilities of each. But there were no rules, per se. I simply "had to be right." If I was wrong, there was no plan...which is very scary, actually. Plus I liked to risk a lot and leverage myself as much as possible. My thinking was that if I was going to put so much work into something and take a risk, then I ought to be paid accordingly. Right now the trouble I'm having is that there are always so many great trades happening or in development that I don't know which one to pick! It's almost embarrassing.

YES! Excellent Dovilo! Well done my friend, well done!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I'm still not sure. I mean, it's true that D1 is completely out of position for a short trade (RAC scrubs the zero level) so I definitely shouldn't take a trade on a H4 timeframe. But what about H1/H4 pair? Selling on H1 with eyeballing H4 looked nice. Should I look on more TFs than just one higher, or maybe it was just one of these trades that went in wrong direction after all (well, we can't predict future with 100% accuracy)?

Hi Rammstein, may be concentrating on one pair or instrument may be the way to go. trying to catch something happening on 30 odd currency pairs is a bit daunting! Gold would be a good one, when it moves, it really moves a lot of pips. Thanks Almuten for that story of your torpedo trade. How true it is, all you need is one good GOOD trade per month and you've made it!

Hi Dovilo, GBPUSD Two other parts of this that I just noticed (sorry I didn't dissect this more thoroughly - I'm pretty tired right now) is to look at the number of bars between the M15 and H1 trigger. They are over 70 bars apart. Also, the RAC crossing came quite a bit after the HAC crossing on H1. Both of these indicate poor alignment...but not bad trades necessarily. It only means that the "tides of the market" aren't quite in sync enough for a truly spectacular move. At least H1 hit a 2x spot on though, which is still pretty decent.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
NZDJPY Now this pair was a bit more challenging Dovilo. The reason is because there were active H4 trades to the long side still in play. There were two of them. The general rule is to consider them a factor until either: 1. The pivot is taken out 2. 3x has been hit Until one of these occur, proceed carefully with any counter trend trade. Refer to post 313, 4-c. In situations like this, situations where there's large investment in one direction or the other, it's a good idea to keep an eye on M15-M1. If you have the time to keep your eye on it, it's no problem. If not, then I would not want to trade against the H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GBPJPY - Today's Bottom Under a Microscope I know this is getting into some precision stuff, but I wanted to highlight that 'surprise' bottom this pair made today. We all saw it coming, right? We knew 'they' were up to something big. My God, the Benford made so many crosses in this area it was maddening, wasn't it? Anyway, what I did was put x levels from all the trades to the short side so you could see how many were in the same area. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #345 ---
... Ignored Yes...and I think that most big traders are likely just working one or two pairs full-time and make a very good living doing so. I've been considering working one currency group - perhaps the Yen pairs. Those are generally great movers. Plus, if you care to put the Benford on different groups, you'll see that levels can get established pretty close to the same time and general area. When this happens, it generally means that they will move as a group too. Plus the H&amp;R will signal close in time from one pair of the same group to another. One of them will be the leader, generally. If gold is your thing, other metals might also establish areas of interest as well. I don't know much about metals, but I imagine that oftentimes they, too, will move as a group.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
No problem. It's true that there is a lot os space between H1 trigger and M15 trigger but that means I should look at more TFs than just two (H1 main with H4 as a filter for example). Thanks for the insight. Well, lets say my main TF will be H1. I will be looking for confirmation on both M15 and H4. The pairs that are looking promising for now are: EUR/USD with all three TFs above or almost above RAC 80, I will wait for them to cross it from the upside, albeit it can take a while. M15 is also pretty far away from HAC. USD/JPY with all TFs under the RAC 20, with M15 almost breaking it. I don't think it will actually work in the near future out because H1 and H4 are really far away from HAC. EUR/JPY looks really nice. On M15 and H1 RAC just crossed its MA and price closed above HAC. It looks worse on H4 with price coming above HAC a week ago, and it stays there. Continuation of a choppy market? CAD/JPY looks much like EUR/JPY. AUD/JPY looks the best from the last 3 pairs but unfortunately, it has R/R of only about 1:1 on H4. So, for today, for pairs I have scanned I don't see any trades. And that can be okay, markets are exhausted with recent two big news (ECB increasing QE and FED not increasing USD rates). Also It's much better not to trade at all than to trade badly.

Timing: Introduction Just when you thought it was over... There's another aspect to this, one that I think some of you will appreciate and could be ready for. I don't want to overwhelm anybody, as I know some are just beginning to have the lights turned on. More information can overload mental circuits...and we certainly don't want that. But if that happens, merely let the mind rest for a while and continue on when ready. I think what I have here will help calm some people down, help them relax and wait patiently for setups or profit targets to materialize. It's nice to be able to walk away from the monitor, isn't it? I have over 500 pages of research notes when it comes to this system. Some of my more extensive ones have to do with timing using the RAC. At the time I made these notes, I was using static cycles of 24 periods. Sometimes this worked well, while at other times, it did not. However, using a dynamically-adjusted cycle works wonders with this. Before I get into this, I would advise you to master the basic H&amp;R system FIRST. This is because the application of this particular technique requires skill and discretion. Prior to mastery, the mind tends to want to 'systematize' everything into a series of mindless actions. Resist this temptation...please.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Almuten How do you dynamically adjust the cycle of 24 hours. can you give hourly breakup. I remember on Mql4.com forum somebody had asked to measure speed of tick flow per second. But what is your method. kind regards.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
You, my friend, will probably have some keen insights into this. I'll be interested to hear them when they come! In fact, it was YOU who reminded me of this method. When you made your comment about the .382 multiplier and why it worked, etc... it turned a light on for me and I remembered my testing I did over six months ago...so thank you!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Timing: Lesson 1 Let's return to our old friend "The Beast." What I've done here is to put on the cycle period indicator in order to obtain the period length at the time the RAC was crossed. This gave an extremely clean signal, as the HAC was crossed exactly on that moment. At that moment, the cycle period was 40. What I did was place the Fib Cycle tool on the HAC crossing and extended it 40 periods into the future. Subsequent lines are at 1.62 * 40 and 2.62 * 40 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[quote=Timo7;8821322] This is the only true for me. May be there are traders who can monitor many instruments, but not me. I've tried to do that, but failed. All the instruments have their own spirit. I have to be tuned to instrument to feel its "breathing" in his different TF cycles. M oreover, we need time to rest, and when we work with 1-2 instruments we have this time. But 30 instruments could make us redeyed crazy. Besided, in my experience there is simultaneity in different pairs activity. So I'm tuned on one of them, that matches to my requirements.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Just one question about timing. How do you count cycle period? From red HAC cross to extremum, I see it right? May be to count cycle "from cross to cross" should be more correct? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Lesson 2 - The Best Circumstances for Application Some care needs to be taken when it comes to applying this. I like higher TFs because it's the most useful on those. Below M15 things get a little dodgy at times. For the following reasons, you should stay at M15 &amp; above. 1. The large players who create these cyclic patterns are playing for many pips - and those are generally found only on larger TFs. 2. When we get below M15, there are too many cross-currents running. M1 &amp; M5 might be running against the tide of M15 or H1. 3. If the lower TFs are moving with the larger TFs, then why not just use the larger TFs anyway? Like the general HAC rules, before applying timing for use as a profit-taking tool, we ought to have support of a larger TF in the same direction. Otherwise, the results might not be so reliable. In my GBPJPY example, H4 RAC had not crossed yet in that last short. It did however approach its green HAC line and the RAC was leveling out and getting ready to cross. Like I said, some skill and discretion is required. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
And here it is on a D1. Sometimes this can be quite useful in a choppy market situation. When the cycle length is very short (in this example it was at 17) this will generally indicate chop. I'm sure some of you have noticed by now that when the RAC is jumping around a lot, the market tends to be choppy. That's because the cycles are very short and this will be reflected in the RAC. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I think I'm just going to let this sit with you guys for a bit. You'll discover many applications for this and can, in all likelihood, incorporate it into a general strategy for your respective operations. Just try not to press it too far. Timing is a 'magical' thing indeed, especially something that gives information days and weeks ahead in some cases. There can be a temptation to overdo it and become overly dependent on it to the exclusion of all else. I plan to keep track of certain markets in a spreadsheet and have a 'countdown' timer that shows me anything that might be due for the day. At least I'm going to see how well this works. Naturally, as Rammstein indicated, too many markets make this method cumbersome, so I'll be limiting my tracking to just a few.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Interesting that you brought that up because I did try it that way and it seemed to have some merit, but the way I do it is to put the "CyclePeriod" indicator (it's in your indy folder) on the chart to obtain the period. But don't let me dissuade you from doing your own experimentation. It might work just fine in the manner you brought up. There are issues with using an extreme pivot to the HAC cross though. One major problem I encountered was in very dull, slow-moving markets where the proper pivot wasn't clear enough. But the cycle indy has no such limitations, which is a major reason why I opted for it.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi T4xr, I don't adjust anything from a 24 hour cycle. I think I might have some notes on various experiments I did on this but will have to dig them out The cycle I'm using is one derived from Ehler's formula for finding the cycle period, which is purely statistical rather than synodic.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Almuten can you link me to Ehler's formula, or give me .mq4 source that does cycle period. It seems important how it gets its output numbers at different times. off course it has to do with pinpointing the moment of big money activity that surprises all retailers. Depending solely on Benford all the time will not be so wise also unless we can extract some indication from market data itself. BTW in Benford you are counting frequency of digits [1's and 4's] in price data of a week or month, right? To me it sounds like asking a fortune teller what is next. regards

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hey T4xr, If you want to see the formula for the cycle period, you can open it up in the indicator itself. It's in the list of indys in your MT4 under "CyclePeriod." I didn't write it, btw. It's also in Ehler's books. As to the "Benford" being the preserve of 'fortune tellers,' I'm VERY happy to hear you say that! It's always been my thinking that a mathematically-gifted person (especially the quants that work for these large firms) would never suspect that we can peek under their skirts. But also note that I'm not advocating being 100% reliant upon the phenomenon. I'm merely saying that it gives more credence to an already established bias...and maybe some advanced warning to boot. As to the counting of numbers, I'm using a sample size of only 60 periods on an M1 chart. 48 periods on M5 also works but not as frequently. This stuff does show up on occasion on a monthly or weekly chart but to my mind, it can't be the result of a long term trading program. In cases like that, it's probably something else - a disruption of normal activity, but not due to a single trading program. For instance, some currencies that have been consolidating for a year or two will have a huge, sustained change in the Benford just prior to breaking out for a massive move. This isn't always the case, but it does happen.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Early Benford Tests For the skeptical I want to show you a chart of some analysis I did on the leading digit of Volume (red) vs. Range (blue). As you can see, they make very similar patterns - particularly evident are the spikes, which show very abrupt deviations from "natural." Now one has to ask "WHY would there be such correlation in numbers that really have nothing to do with each other?"

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I made a little nicer template for watching M1 charts if anybody wants to use this one instead. But low-power computer users beware! There are several more instances of the Benford on it...and you know what that means.

Hi Almuten and group! vvFish I got this:

VVFish, you need to add the Benford Analysis indicator in post 258, page 13. Moonie.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi, Almuten! I've tried your new template, but I can't see anything on it. Red crosses white, or blue crosses red, but I don't see anything behind of all those crossings. Should I buy, or should I sell? Those crossings don't clear this moment TO ME. May be it should be aplied to higher TFs? I don't know, but that's not mine in the present way. Btw, that is another method and I don't understand - why it's here?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Almuten, I'm just watching UJ, thinking it might be going short. The RSI has shot up while the RAC is buried below 20 on the H1. Please can you give your opinion. Many thanks Moonie.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
New Template...and why it's here I think I'll likely lose some subscribers from saying this, but the reason I made a new template with more Benford indys on it is because that 'guidance' I keep telling you guys about said this to me on Friday: "5 and 9 are the numbers we are working with now..." It was unmistakable and as clear as a bell. That's how this whole system, more or less, came about btw. How could I not listen to it? And how could I not also share it? So what I did was alter the "range divisor" for each indy. Top set: Digit 1 - range divisor of 9; Digit 4 - range divisor of 5 Middle set: Digit 1 - range divisor of 1; Digit 4 - range divisor of 1 Bottom set: Digit 1 - range divisor of 5; Digit 4 - range divisor of 9 After a weekend of testing, I saw immediately the value of it, but I don't understand the basis of it. I just don't. Perhaps somebody else can shed some light on it or maybe at some point I'll understand it or be led to a place where I can understand it. It's led to deeper questions for me for sure. But the way it behaves is almost like three different groups are entering/exiting the market. What it seems to do reliably though is indicate the areas with the greatest big money involvement. For instance, when all three indys make a cross with each other, especially after a major bottom or top on H1 or H4, that level will not only hold, but launch a major campaign. When the market is running, not one of the indys will cross each other until a profit target is approaching. Then maybe one or two of them will cross. If a major turning point is happening though, once again, all three will make crosses, either simultaneously, or in the same general area, and sometimes even multiple times. I spent a good 35 hours testing it since Friday. But this isn't the kind of thing that a guy who wants to trade a bunch of currencies is going to want to mess with. It's better to stick to one or two pairs if you want to get in depth in this way. It's not necessary at all.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Almuten, many thanks for your hard work over the weekend. Can I ask, approximately how many crossovers typically happen in a week? Kind Regards Moonie.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi Almuten, really enjoying your thread. A lot of it is over my head stuff but I plan to try and digest it over the long term. I think you're on to something with the 5 and 9 cycles. The technical analysis software Wave 59 is named for one of its indicators which finds waves based on the individual numerical values of five and nine...not the number 59. I trialed the software a few years ago and didn't make much progress as my job got very busy but its full of interesting esoteric techniques. http://www.wave59.com/About/EarikBeannBio.aspx

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I too, have been trying to do back testing on the new Benford Template, (Thanks Almuten), but am very frustrated with MT4, with trying to get enough back history on the M1 charts. Does any one know a quick way to force MT4 to download weeks and weeks of M1 back history?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Wow...that's a very good question and one that I don't have an answer for! I didn't have time to write things down and keep records of my testing, etc... But logically, if we think about it, these ought not to happen all that frequently. Generally they will collect at the tops and bottoms of large moves on the H1 &amp; H4. Keep your eye out near old 3x &amp; 4x profit target areas. If you do see many in the same area over and over, it might mean choppy waters ahead. But the H&amp;R will keep you out of trouble.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hey Poocher, I am quite familiar with Wave 59, actually! I used it for almost a year - definitely a chartist's package. I didn't make that 5 &amp; 9 correlation either, so thank you! Perhaps I need to contemplate it from that angle. I have their book of techniques that I read years ago - lots of very interesting stuff in there to be sure I think I might take another look at it. But as to learning the methodology, it will sink in after a bit. Think of Russian dolls - all nesting within one another. I tried to keep it as simple as possible, with clear rules and so on. One thing logically fits into another, etc... But do not hesitate to ask a question. If I can answer it with a rule (see post 313), then I'll refer you to it. If something falls outside the rules, then I'll offer an explanation. But the Benford thing...now that is definitely a little out there. I wouldn't focus too much on that at first though. It's just an addendum, really. This method can get really involved sometimes. Back in the day, I generally only traded one market so I wanted something that could help me to know what was going on in a single market pretty much all the time (virtually impossible, I know, but I have to try, right?). Anyway, the Benford just adds another layer for a person requiring more in-depth understanding of the fundamentals behind the market - that being big money.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Timo, The only thing I know of is to use the 'History Center.' Just hit "F2" and it will appear. Then you can select the pair and TF you want to download. I also think that you might have to alter the "options' to be able to have enough chart data displayed. The indy is a real resource hog though...so beware. You might want to shut off the data feed while you're putting it on and doing your testing. It will display much, much faster when it doesn't have to calculate the entire series with every new tick.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi Moonie, I would be very careful right now about that. There are several reasons I'm saying this. For starters, the M15 RAC is plastered against the ceiling (and it was 5 hours ago too). Also, the HAC on H1 is close to being penetrated, so one must be careful. Generally, when you see extremes like that - one TF saying one thing and another saying the opposite, it portends of choppy waters ahead. Makes sense, right? But here's the hard thing to remember...when things don't make sense, then stay away. Forexalien drilled that one into me!

USDJPY - Beware of the fakeout Trading requires patience...lots of patience. When the time to pull the trigger comes, especially after lots and lots of waiting for the proper signal, it's very easy to get trigger happy. Way too easy! That's what our rules are for. In the chart below I pointed out a few things to help keep things in check. This kind of thing happens all the time, so it's good to beware of. 1. There were around 50 M15 periods between the M15 HAC crossing and the H1 crossing - already a warning to not be long...at least for long . Sometimes this isn't a major issue, so long as the market hasn't really moved much. But this one was on a run. It's not going far. 2. The M15 already hit a 3x profit target - which typically calls for a retracement of some depth most times. 3. The RAC crossing was late on H1. The market had already pulled away from the HAC for several periods 4. The RSI on H4, when the market penetrated the green HAC line, hadn't even so much as budged. When a trade is really good, the RSI will have popped by the time the green HAC is hit. If it had popped in this instance, it might have mitigated some other factors to some extent. There might be an exception brewing here...but as traders, we can't play exceptions unless we discover a statistically viable reason for doing so.

Ok, now I'm checking this hypothesis online. Let's see, but that sounds very good. And that looks like You have naked one more grail... I've found the #NIKKEY's level, where all three indies have crossings. It was formed on march, 18-th, 15:50 terminal time about. Price rose 400 points after that, now it is retracing. It looks like 1-st wave up is formed and 2-nd wave is forming. I'll post later - what came out of it.

RAC as a Support &amp; Resistance Generator A week or two ago I mentioned that the RAC can be used to find areas of support and resistance. It can generate these far in advance and also be used spontaneously under the proper conditions. As I've said several times, even though there are only two indicators to work with (not including the 'bonus' indy in the form of the Benford), these do quite a lot of work for us. The reason for that is because they are designed to dig out key bits of information. If you've absorbed what's been presented so far, I think this next concept will make a lot of intuitive sense. First, remember what the RAC is for. It's to measure momentum toward one side of the market equilibrium or the other. Two major areas of interest for us have been the 80 and 20 levels. The other key level, and one that I mentioned briefly once or twice, is the 50 level. Why are the 80 and 20 important? These levels are important because generally speaking, when the RAC reaches beyond them, it represents a point where the market is straying too far from equilibrium relative to its current cycle. Sometimes this is sustained during a strong trend...but very strong trends aren't all that common. In the example below, note that the RAC has crossed its own average a couple of times, yet it did not cross the HAC line until it dipped below 80. Beyond 80 or 20, the market will need time to come back to equilibrium. Everybody has seen this plenty of times by now. Maybe even a few have gotten burned for not waiting until it crossed 80 or 20. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The place where 80 or 20 was originally crossed will prove to be important in the future though. At least these can be watched if one wishes. Plus it might help to focus the mind a little on a given area. This can be useful when a signal occurs because many, many times a signal will occur near one of these support &amp; resistance areas. The rough logic behind it is this: 1. The place where this happened, most likely, triggered some breakout systems. Generally, about 70% or more breakouts fail after a short time. 2. If scalpers were trading in the opposite direction from moving averages, they lost on those trades. In both cases, the area where the 80 or 20 was crossed will prove to be significant for many people on a collective basis. We've all seen places where once it was support, it becomes resistance or visa versa. The reason for that is because the bias has shifted. People lost money buying in a support area, so when the market returns to it from below, they will collectively sell it and so forth. The 50 Level: This level is important for relatively obvious reasons. It's the halfway point, which is particularly important when using a cyclical methodology like ours. In my next post I will demonstrate the proper way of applying it and how it might be best employed.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
General Guidelines: 1. Places for support are drawn at the LOW of the bar when the 80,20 and 50 levels have been crossed from ABOVE. 2. Places for resistance are drawn at the HIGH of the bar when the 80,20 and 50 levels have been crossed from BELOW. Like so: Attachment The first crossing was from below so it's drawn from the high. The next was from above back through 20 ever so slightly, so it was drawn from the low of that bar. The third one was from below so it was drawn at the high, etc...

--- 帖子 #384 ---
General Guideline #2: In order to minimize the number of lines and to highlight the ones with the highest probability for being significant, I wish to make a recommendation, but first I will explain my reasons behind it. First of all, I like to see markets as having to spring far from equilibrium (above 80 or below 20), find their balance and then spring too far the other way. In between times are when the key S&amp;R levels are established. So let's say that the market crosses above 20 and we draw a line. Next, it crosses 50 and we draw another line. But let's say that it crosses 50 the other way and then maybe even across it again and again and again... It might do that ten times back and forth. Why is it doing that? Because the market isn't going anywhere. Therefore, there's no need to keep drawing lines each time it makes a cross over 50. Before another line can be drawn at the 50 level, the market ought to have first reached the 20 or 80 levels. In this way it kind of "resets" itself by moving out of equilibrium and then back toward it again.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
What about the times when price crosses the red HAC line at the same time as the RAC crosses 80 or 20? are they stronger support and resistance levels, or do we ignore the red HAC line for this?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
In a way, any crossing of the 80 or 20 is going to have some support/resistance qualities to it, even during a signal. Fortunately we have the wind at our backs when this happens, which is why when a proper signal does occur, the bars tend to get larger afterwards. There's been a kind of capitulation at the place of collective equilibrium.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
The new #NIKKEI level was established (with "3-crossings rule") at midnight today. That means that previous bullish level, I was wrote about, is aborted. His swing was 400 points within 5 days. That's very good. I think that new level is bearish and, so, testing of "3-crossings rule" (based on the Benford Template) still running. Let's see...

Hello Almuten, I have been reading and re-reading this thread for the past week with a lot of interest and, may I begin by thanking you sincerely for sharing your trading system, knowledge and experience. I'm struggling to digest this trading method and wondered whether it was just me being a numpty. I created a crib sheet based on lots of the threads (posts 6, 80 and 313 especially) but where I am struggling is: On MT4 should I just set my charts on e.g. the M15 time frame? If a candle crosses the red HAC and the RAC crosses (preferably crosses the 80 or 20 lines) on the M15 time frame, should I then look at the 1 hour and 4 hour charts to see if the same thing has happened (unlikely event - I think you named it)? If it does, I should take the trade via the M15 chart? I read and re-read the information about using the fibo tool but made no sense of which time frame and how to apply it but will keep reading over and over. is it possible to post a chart from say today which explains it for me, sorry for being a numpty. Thank you Scchplendid

Attention All Interested Parties: Over the past two weeks I've had some major life changes going on. I haven't had access to my computer for that time, but I will be back to answer current outstanding questions and those in the future. My apologies for not notifying everyone. It was all rather sudden for me. Within a few days I should be up and running again. Almuten.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi Scchplendid, First of all, you're not a 'numpty' (that's a new one for me btw). Second, with regard to what TF to set the charts on, you can trade just one TF, but I think the strength of the method really lies in seeing how well multiple TFs align in rapid succession. What this means is that the lower TFs will trigger prior to the higher. Therefore, if you see the signal on H1, the M15 will have already been underway. But here's what you can do. If you see a signal on M15 with the red HAC being crossed, etc..., look then at the H1 and see whether or not the green HAC was crossed at the same time the red HAC on M15 was crossed. If so, this is good alignment. If it happens that H1 has its red HAC crossed, then look at H4 to see if the green HAC on that TF was crossed at the same time. If so, it will indicate that those two TFs are aligned. Work your way up as high as you can. When you find the highest TF that has alignment, move to the next lower one to find your profit targets. If you're having trouble with the fib tool, see post # 182. If that still doesn't help, let me know specifically what's going on and we'll look at it together.

Ok, just checking in here. I know it's been awhile since I've been on here but my life has been in a complete upheaval over the past six weeks or so. My wife asked me to leave (well, screamed it repeatedly actually, for months) so I did. I have no job and what money I have is nearly gone for the moment. I don't have enough capital to hope to make a living from trading - just a very small account to at least begin the arduous process of getting it into my bones and I'm not sure I'm ready to even do that right now. As luck would have it, I have a friend who is old and somewhat feeble. He needed a roommate to help him get his life together. So that's where I am - getting both my and his life together. We're both in financial straights at the present time but little miracles happen now and then to get us by. His house was in shambles - dog poop and pee everywhere and it hadn't been cleaned in years ever since his wife died. Anyway, I've been cleaning, painting every room in his house, plus the outside in exchange for living here. That's been my life for the last six weeks. Amidst all the changes and financial constraints, it's been very difficult to put my mind on trading. The healing is coming quickly though. If I can get through this without losing my mind in the process, trading should be a piece of cake Meanwhile, if anyone has any charts they'd like to post, please do so. I check for questions on a regular basis too. Almuten

Hello, I'm sorry for your troubles, life is not easy for anyone, but everytime a door gets closed you can find an either bigger one opening just for you. If I may give you a suggest, keep your savings, for little they might be, apart for the day you will be ready to trade real and train yourself on demo only. Your system is very simple to use but behind it there are smart thoughts and you can make good pips with it: however it is essential to your success to educate your mind to trading environment because trading is first of all a state of mind. Your mindset is your true Holy Grail, so take care of it and train it the best as you can. I wish you all the best!

Hi Everyone, After a few PMs I thought it might be nice to post something and let everyone know what's going on with me. First of all, I'm not trading anything, but I do look at charts every day and explore different possibilities on how to manage the H&amp;R better. It's still fun for me. More on that in a bit. Even though I'm not trading or even making regular money on a consistent basis, life has turned into an incomprehensible stream of joy and peace for me. I literally live by prayer and miracles. I never know what any day, or even any moment, might bring, but I've never lacked anything I've needed for these many months. Most of my time is spent in meditation, study of sacred texts and teaching. A bit of distance from trading, right? I think I've always wanted to do this "trust experiment," you know? It was a desire to be free from fear and to know what true freedom is. But I'll tell you what drove me to this. It was TRADING! The anxiety, the uncertainty, the hope and the despair - all of it - brought out a deep yearning for something to count on; something that wouldn't cost me my freedom. After all, what could be worse than an imprisoned will? It's more than just trust and having my needs supplied, though. Through all of that there's been a relationship with the Divine established. And along with that comes daily guidance that inevitably leads to peace and complete freedom for me. Will I ever trade again? I have no idea. But what was it originally for anyway? Was it not to have freedom? Why seek for what's already here? And therein lies the dilemma. But I still love those charts! I have a couple of ideas that might be useful. For the past several months I've been using an M15 chart with a Benford on it - standard, original settings. I put it on by 'accident' one day and checked to see if it might help predict larger moves such as H&amp;R signals on H4. It appears to work very well for that purpose. The other idea would be for a dashboard to measure the 'tightness' of signals between one time frame and the next, but I haven't worked out the most feasible way (and least CPU intensive) to do that just yet. Perhaps somebody has a good idea or two on how to accomplish that. I want to thank everyone here once again for the encouragement and support. I thoroughly enjoy sharing what I have and by doing so, it seemed to have returned something more to me on many levels. If anyone ever asks the question "Where's Almuten?" You can find me on my Youtube channel. I pretty much document my "trust experiment" and the things I learn on here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis...VSN9ac3rk7FEgG May your minds be at peace and your wallets full of green pips!

Wow , what a wonderful surprise Kris ! I am very very happy because you have been able to overcome your material problems and now you're in a condition of happiness and peace. Moreover , I am happy because you continue to be interested to Forex : we can not waste a brilliant mind like your ! However, I'm going to see your videos on Youtube... That the Divinity can be always with you .

Alright... Now you guys might think I'm nuts with my 'being led' thing, but here's what came out of a 2 hour meditation. I felt like I had to use a HAC indicator in histogram format (see attached). What I did next was to put ATR bands on it. I used a standard 14 period ATR and made one positive and one negative. The HAC histogram measures the distance of the closing price from the HAC line (close - HAC). The ATR lets me know the signal strength. The best trades (seemingly so far) are the ones that have the histogram break the ATR band when the candle is still touching the HAC line or 1-2 periods after. If it takes longer than that to break the bands, the probability of a choppy market and/or failed trade goes up greatly. I didn't know how to program the ATR into the HAC oscillator so I overlaid it and adjusted the scale on all three indicators so they matched up in scale. But here's what I'm thinking. What if a dashboard were to give alerts on all tracked markets; perhaps on different time frames, that met the criteria of breaking the ATR bands? That way they could all be monitored easily. Also, the larger TFs could be checked for overall trend strength. For example, if H4 was running strong over its ATR band and the M15 gave a very strong signal, it might be a better probability that it will hit a 3x target, etc... Comments welcome! Almuten

Visually, it seems to be really nice. About exits, do u still stay with your initial rules?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Almuten, it's nice to hear from you again. I also watched some of your videos, and I like them. Just a question, how did you set up the scale in the indicators to read like they read? I tried, but cannot get it to look like your screen. It seems like your onto a another good idea once again, but can you explain it a little more so i can try to set up my screen to look like yours? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hey manuoz, I'm not entirely sure about the exits. I would seem to be a good idea to use the original exits. Bear in mind that the purpose of this is to create a simplified dashboard; something that doesn't require loads of CPU power to operate a dozen or more markets on.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hey Timo7, I've attached the indys I used on the screenshot above, along with a template. Since I'm not much of a programmer, I didn't know how to integrate the ATR indicators into the HAC oscillator, which is why I had to create a separate ATR indicator (by using the original one and multiplying by -1) and also adjusting the scaling for all three. If I was more clever I could have integrated the ATR into the HAC oscillator itself. Perhaps someone here would know best how to do that. Once this is accomplished, I think the next step would be to search for true/false scenarios such as: 1. If any part of the candle is touching the HAC line = TRUE 2. If #1 = TRUE on the current bar OR 1 bar ago AND HAC oscillator is &gt; or &lt; than ATR band= TRUE 3. If #2 = TRUE and HAC oscillator is &lt; ATR band, then = potential short scenario 4. If #2 = TRUE and HAC oscillator is &gt; ATR band, then = potential long scenario Now if there's a legitimate scenario brewing, then it makes sense to check out the RAC, etc... and verify everything. Again, this is just to enable a person to have a quick &amp; ready overview of various time frames and markets. Great trades tend to happen under these conditions and most often tighter stops can be used. When these conditions aren't present, the trade tends to fail or only reach a 1x or 2x target. Almuten ps: thanks for watching my vids

A Note on Template Scaling: I know at least a few people are going to notice that my template scaling, with some markets at least, is going to show a solid blue line and no histogram at all. When I originally made this template I was playing around with GBPJPY, which is one of the more wily and volatile markets out there. For that market, a scaling of -1 and +1 works well. Others won't. So if that scaling doesn't work with your favorite market you'll have to change it to whatever does work. But DO REMEMBER to change the scaling on all three indicators.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Something New... After a long and patient wait, I'm nearly ready to begin trading again. At last, life circumstances have afforded me an ideal situation in which to operate from day to day. But I've been refining a few things because trading is going to be my means of self-support and because I only have a small account, I must find many high-probability opportunities. I'm sure some of you are in similar circumstances. Attachment G Most of the concern people have is with finding great setups that are well-defined and simple. Recall the main method of using the RAC indicator in combination with the HAC. In that method, there were a couple of elements that I'll be using with this one. In particular, the 80 and 20 levels. This method is simpler in a couple of respects: 1. First, there are no multiple time-frames involved (although one would be wise to consult higher TFs for similar, in-progress trades). 2. There is no HAC line 3. An adaptive stochastic is used instead of the RAC. The Adaptive Stochastic is just like a normal stochastic, except that the period length is adaptive. It is slowed by 3 periods to ensure smoothness. I've also taken out the second line (or hidden it, really) because it isn't needed. The Setups: Setup #1 Rules: 1. The stochastic breaks the 20 level to the upside. It MUST clear it completely for accurate profit target calculating. 2. When the stochastic has cleared the 20 level, it must also have broken a trendline (see below) 3. It MUST close in the direction of the trade. If the trade is long, then it must close UP. Below is a screenshot of the ideal long setup:

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Profit Targets: This method is similar to the regular HAC &amp; RAC, but instead of using a line drawn on the chart, we use the high of the trigger bar. The usual profit targets are considered. See below:

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Here's the setup going the other way. This one's not as "clean," but one has to consider that it's going counter-trend. Eventually, the trade nearly hit a 3x target, but it took several days. But even the 1x target, which was hit very quickly, provided 156 pips on H1.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Consolidation Setup: This setup is a little counter-intuitive, but it does help in dealing with those consolidation areas where things are often unclear. What happens here is much the same as the prior setups, only this time, a crossing BELOW 20 is needed for a short (above 80 for longs). The profit targets are drawn from the top of the consolidation area to the low of the trigger bar. Everything else is still required though: 1. a break of a trendline 2. a close in the direction of the trade In this example, the 1x was hit very quickly.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Here's a real beauty. This one hit a 5x target. It should be noted however that the trigger bar was the same as the bar that broke the trendline. I think these are much more decisive and less prone to retracements.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
And here we go back the other way... A nice, 2x target was reached without issue.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Interesting Phenomena: Some of you have carefully read this thread and have followed my journey in developing what I'm intent on using. The more I investigate my own methods, the more I discover, both on a theoretical level, as well as practical. In a prior post (I can't remember which), I talked about the 80 and 20 levels where the RAC was concerned; how they were places where the market would attempt to "escape" its bounds and go into a heavy trend mode. As I thought more about that, I realized that "normal" market activity occurs in between those levels - above 20 and below 80. Since I'm a Fibonacci fan from way back, and because I have a special regard for the 78.6% level, I added two more lines to my oscillators. What I did was take the "normal" zones of +20 and -80 and located the 78.6% level within those. They are: 67.16% 32.84% There is a high tendency for highs and lows (or at least the beginnings of pullbacks) to occur when either the RAC or the adaptive stochastic reaches those levels. If the pullback doesn't occur, then the tendency is for that level to be support/resistance for the next swing. It may or may not be of practical value, but I do have a better sense on whether or not the market will continue in its direction. First, I'll show you what I'm talking about : In the examples below, note that the RAC crossed the 67.16% level down and then later crossed it back up. I put those levels in green . Those places will be either beginnings of a retracement, future S&amp;R areas, or both. Either way, it's a good way for me to be alerted to a specific area. Note the stochastic setups that happened around those levels (examples are above). I like to be more contemplative than reactive with trading. Stuff like this helps me not get too trigger-happy and encourages patience.

Hi Almuten, I'm glad your starting trading again. I'm certain you will succeed. Thank you for keeping up this thread. I like the way you think. I'm a bit surprised however, that you would abandon the Hac and Rac, after all that work on it, and it showing the cycles in the market etc, but it's still there for us to use if we want, and thanks for that! It all boils down to high probability trades, no matter what method is used. So please, keep us informed, I will also back test and forward test the adaptive stochastic method, it looks good so far, and it's simple, and not a resource hog. Perfect!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hello Almuten , welcome FF home ! Me too , as Timo7 , I'm surprised for the abandonment of amazing Hac &amp; Rac . You had done an excellent and hard work with H&amp;R : in my modest opinion, you should continue the development of this method , maybe introducing some novelties as ATR and Hac-Composite ( post # 415 ) . Of course , you decide !

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello! The indicator in the 419 post is not displayed on the graph. Build 1045.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I haven't abandoned it. It will still figure in my outlook, but I wanted to find something to keep the trades coming. It's been a year since I first posted the HAC &amp; RAC and it's still holding up well!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I'm not an MT4 expert. But maybe somebody can lend you a hand.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Yeah the adaptive stochastic really does help on the resources. I'm also noticing that there's a pretty high tendency for it to cross 50 when the HAC line is crossed, so that might be an adequate trigger instead of using the RAC. I am going to display some good uses for it on a D1 chart as well. It helps to find some really great setups.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Yes, D1 is the way to go. Lifestyle trading. 15 mins per day. /media/tj/88EA-26A7/adaptive stoch.png

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I'm beginning to pull out my old technical analysis training and am looking at the D1 charts for good setups. It makes sense to trade logical setups on that timeframe. Fancy indicators are great and I'm glad I spent so much time developing them (because they, too, have a logical basis), but traditional things on D1 are also of great value; especially since the H&amp;R can validate what's happening and offer a reasonable expectation for profits. I'm looking at a couple of things that I think will be of use to others. The first is just a really simple sort of setup on D1 that uses trendlines from high to high and low to low, etc... Lots of professional traders trade the D1 in this way. M15 and H1 are probably of the greatest value when combining D1 analysis because the setups have enough bars to complete. The first one I want to show is just a basic trendline from high to high. Attached Image The next chart shows what it looked like on M15. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Closing Prices on D1 Another thing you can watch for are the closing prices on D1. On the VERY BEST trades, what tends to happen is that the next day's HAC line will be very close to the prior day's closing price. Logically this makes sense, given what the HAC line represents: The line in the sand where losers are on one side and winners on the other. The screenshot below is of the GBPUSD when it made its low earlier this week. I've circled the area of interest on D1: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The pic below has the closing price of the red candle from D1 drawn on an M15 chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Here's another example on the short side: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #436 ---
There's also other things that can be watched for using the adaptive stochastic and the RAC indicators. As I mentioned a few posts back, they have a tendency to indicate pivotal highs and lows. In my research, I'm finding this useful, particularly on D1. Of specific interest are the 67.16% and 32.84% levels. When either one of those indicators crosses through one of those levels... beware of a high or low in the making. It's not a guarantee, but it is a very high probability. If a strong trend is present, then all bets are off. Stochastics is meant for choppy or medium swing markets. In the example below I marked the places of likely turns. A cross UP indicates resistance or upward exhaustion. A cross DOWN indicates support. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Can someone help me with the indicator of 419 posts? The problem is depicted in 428 post.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I was wondering... Do you have the "CyclePeriod.exe" indicator in your list of indicators? If not, then that is most likely the reason nothing is working.

H4 Setups &amp; how to find them After working with this every day for over a year I finally found out how to locate good H4 setups. This is done similarly to how setups are found on M15 for short term trades, but H4 trades, because they can go for weeks sometimes, must be located using trendline breaks from key pivots on D1. In the pic below I've drawn multiple trendlines on a D1 chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the next screenshot, I've circled the areas where the D1 trendlines made an impact on H4 (I stripped that chart down to the bare essentials so it's easier to read). The red circled area (the impact zone of the D1 red trendline) didn't produce anything, but even so, that level was important a week later when the green D1 trendline was broken at exactly the same level. Also, prior to that was the area where the white D1 trendline was touched just prior to the drop in price. The market was clearly being boxed in little by little. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next shot was when the D1 blue trendline was broken. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And finally, here's the area where the white D1 trendline was broken. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Today's short on EURJPY This one had a trendline break to the downside. The place where the TL was broken was only 5 pips from the HAC on H1. Generally-speaking, the HAC line will be very close to wherever there is trendline interaction with the price. It's not always certain (what is though!), but it's a reasonable expectation and I think it lends itself to more confidence when pulling the trigger. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Boiling it ALL Down and Simplifying After much deliberation I finally decided on a method of finding what I like to call "Bread &amp; Butter" trades. A lot of you have probably noticed that M5 sets up a lot of decent trades pretty regularly. Problem is, it also sets up a lot of not-so-good ones too. I know I've been all over the map recently and I think it's partly because I've learned these indicators inside and out. There's just too much to be seen with them! But of what can be seen, there must also be a way to prioritize it. Otherwise, confusion quickly sets in. What often happens for me is that, because I've been in "research mode" for so long, I go off on yet another idea or my curiosity beckons me to look into "just one more thing." I'm done with that now. Going cold turkey! Today I deleted all the non-essential work spaces, templates and indicators from my trading platform. I think this thing is ready to finally go online for real. Who Helped Me recently was a trader named "TooSlow" here on FF. "Too Slow" has a very simple method of selling the highest open for the day and buying the lowest open on H1 bars. Generally there's not many pips involved, but every once in awhile, he finds a whopper and because the money management is so rigorous, he can receive at least a pip or two until the big one hits. So I started investigating this method. Here's a link: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=590623 Anyway, after reading hundreds of pages of not only the system being used, but the wonderful inspirational/mind-training bits, I felt convinced that TooSlow's method has something to offer where the M5 Hac &amp; Rac is concerned. It wasn't immediately evident because his HILO method shuns any indicators or "squiggly lines" (as they put it over there), but I could see how using no indicators at all would help me retain focus on just the price and thereby keep me in a state of readiness. Using the HILO method simply tells me that something significant might be happening with the price and to keep an eye on the H&amp;R indicators for a good signal. Below is a great example from this morning. The GBPJPY generated a HOLO alert on H1. Note the simplicity of the chart - there's hardly anything to have to watch. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next, I go to my HAC &amp; RAC workspace for GBPJPY and see what's what. M5 &amp; M15 were in great alignment with the HAC lines. The RAC on H1 hit the 32.84% level and created a support area (always good to see before a signal, whenever that happens). Risk on the trade was around 12 pips. Going to the 3x target produced 48 pips. The 4x (which I didn't have the patience or nerve for), produced 64 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I've added levels 20 and 80 and set maximum at 100 and minimum at 0. So we could see stochastic as we all know it.

More New Stuff After several weeks of testing, I thought a couple of things I've been working on might be helpful. In conjunction with the 'x-levels', I've found that price projections can be made using the RAC and dynamic stochastic. What drove this was the fact that, in a lot of instances, by the time a good signal forms, the price has really pulled away. Hence, the risk/reward becomes unacceptable. This could really challenge some of you because it won't make logical sense, but allow me to explain myself here. What drove my mind toward more mathematically-based methods was due to my experience with the E-Mini futures several years ago. There seemed to be a sophisticated bunch of traders who always knew what the crowd was doing/looking at and where their stops were placed, etc... To my mind, they were using something hidden that measured market momentum. Whatever it was, it wasn't very obvious in either the chart patterns or standard indicators. Anyway, I wanted to find this 'hidden perspective' and trade on their side. I don't know if I've succeeded in doing that, but I think I have uncovered some solid statistical tendencies. Here's what I'm doing: First I'll talk about the RAC when used as a price projector and then the stochastic. They're similar, but I use them for different reasons. The RAC is for getting a feel for the overall trend projection , whereas the stochastic is for fine-tuning a trade entry or finding a risk-acceptable way of entering an already established trend. Here are the steps: 1. Find the dominant swing low/high. This will be point "zero" 2. Watch the RAC when it crosses 20, 50 &amp; 80. 3a. If it crosses UP through one of those levels, then draw Fibonacci levels from 'point zero' to the HIGH of the bar that first exceeds the level. 3b. If it crosses DOWN though one of those levels, then draw the fibs from point zero to the low of the bar that first exceeds the level. #3 will not make sense in some circumstances because it will seldom be on a swing high or low. Most likely, it will be in the middle of a swing, which is why it won't be intuitive. Here's how this generally plays out in a good, clean &amp; strong trend: 333-424% or higher from point zero to a break of the 20 (for longs) or 80 (for shorts) will match the 3x or 4x target. 205%-333% from point zero to a break of the 50 will match the 3x or 4x target 127%-162% from point zero to a break of the 80 (for longs) or 20 (for shorts) will match the 3x or 4x target. Corrective moves and other, more complex aspects of market behavior are handled differently, but more on that later. Below is a basic example. First we begin with drawing the fibs when the 20 level is broken. Note that we are measuring from the swing low to the high of the bar that broke the 20. Also note that there was a 78.6% pullback, which very frequently occurs after a level break (not generally 78.6%, but a fib level nonetheless). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Ok now the market continues on its way and when it crosses 50, we adjust our levels to expand with the market. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #446 ---
And here's when it crossed the 80 level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Before it hit a probable projection, the RAC crossed down below 80 and though you can't see it on this chart, I'll show you on the next. What do we do about that? Well I'm glad you asked because what I'm going to show you is how to tell, with good probability, whether or not a level cross is strong or weak or just a corrective move.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
A lot of times, just before a move exhausts, it crosses the 80/20 levels a couple of times. Generally what occurs is that when the level is crossed, it will make a bounce the other way. In the case below, when the 80 was crossed down, the market bounced back up to a new high and toward our original projection. But this also affords us a new opportunity for a more accurate projection. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this chart, a new fib level was drawn with a new 'zero point' because once a level is crossed the other way, the market kind of 'resets.' The tan box was the original projection. The green box is the new one. We still use the 127%-162% levels for a target because it was an 80 crossing UP. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #448 ---
How all projections came together can be seen by that orange line near the high of the move. There were three RAC projections in EXACTLY the same place, along with a 6x H&amp;R projection. Again, all in the same place. Soon, I'll talk more about the finer points of this, but I thought it might interest some people and help them to see that there is a lot more in the RAC than might meet the eye. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Here's the subsequent move down the other way. What I did here was average all of the probable projections for each RAC crossing and found that they were quite close to the 3x level. The green/yellow lines are the projections from the different levels. The red line is the average of them. Note it's proximity to 3x. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A Few Things to Share This trading thing has really taken me on quite a ride and I thought it might be good to share some things I've learned along the way. First, I'd like to share the developments in my mind - what I've done to eliminate the fear, maintain peace of mind and objectivity, etc... Next, I have some ideas on how to find decent setups rather quickly. The mind development has taken the most time and in my view is the most important. Without that nothing will work. Even if it appears to work on a monetary level, it can't be enjoyed because the fear of losing it again will always remain. There's just no peace in that. I've tried to completely eliminate the fear by creating 'foolproof' trading methods, but alas! Nothing is truly foolproof on that level. The real key, as I see it now, is in having consistency of thought; of the way I see EVERYTHING. How I see anything will be a reflection of how I see myself in any given moment. And so the questions become: What am I? What is the purpose of life? These ARE BIG life questions to be sure, but ones that must be answered before fear can be eliminated. It's the only real way. Answering these question can't be done with hypothetical thinking. They are answered with experience. They are answers that are LIVED because these answers are life itself. For me, and perhaps for some of you, one of my issues had to do with my sense of "worthiness." I was always trying to become "worthy" of this or that and it led me on a fruitless search for self-validation. To look for something one already has is a sure way of never recognizing it. God made us all worthy. It's an innate quality. Nothing can be added or taken away, save for my illusions about myself. But I had to discover this for myself and it was worth more to me than my own life. And so I 'lay down my life,' as it were, and decided to simply accept whatever came, however it came, without searching or grasping or 'working out' my own problems. I thought, "If I'm worthy, truly worthy, then God will care for me no matter what." I focused on two things: 1. Monitored my state of mind for ANY upset and forgave it, regardless of its source, magnitude, form, or how 'justified' it appeared to be. Sometimes this was very difficult because I found that my very identity, in large part, was based on grievances in the form of upsets. To give them up was like giving up my sense of self. 2. Committed myself to be helpful. Whoever asked for or needed my help received it. Some of them paid me something and others could not. It didn't matter. I simply felt that being a servant to humanity, in whatever capacity, was the mission and to allow Spirit to care for the rest. Either God was real or He wasn't. He loved me or He didn't. That, in truth, was at the heart of every upset or worry I ever had. Sure, I dissociated it and put my reasons for fear and worry on other things, but truly, my worth to God was at the heart of it all. I had to be taught my own worth. I had to learn it through experience. For two years I've not had any steady income or even a place to stay of my own and yet...and yet... I've not spent so much as a night outside or lacked for anything or went hungry for even an instant. I'm never lonely or without peace of mind. There's always just enough...and very often, much to my amazement, I'm the one who gives other people money or feeds them. All this and without so much as a trifling of steadiness in income or a "place" in the world. I mean I don't even make minimum wage and my life is better than it ever was! Through all this, naturally, there were times of great fear with regard to how things would turn out or whether or not I'd perish from my apparent foolhardiness. My mind would go to the future and it made me fearful, but it was only because I looked upon the past and hated what I saw there. And having judged it hateful, I projected it onto my own future and condemned myself to repeat it. Slowly, I learned that I was projecting illusions onto the world. I was projecting illusions onto everything - wishes and regrets both. And how could I, having such a mindset, avoid projecting illusions onto the markets? How could I accept the present message they were telling me? I could not. Over time, my sense of worthiness was restored. I discovered that, at my core, there is an unchangeable, immutable Being. It's is God's true Creation...and that is Me. That is You. It's worth is beyond question. Everything else is simply an illusion of a self with all its apparent needs and frailties, but what God wills for His True Creation is perfect peace, unlimited power and unquestioned worth. We are truly mirrors of Himself. I discovered the answer to question #1: What am I? Next question... What is the purpose of life? It almost answers itself, doesn't it? Would it not be to answer question #1? And in the answering of the first question, are all things in life channelized to bring about its expression. There is no real danger or cause for fear. It can't be harmed, even though the world seems to be dangerous. The world, for all its seeming ferocity, is an appearance only and if you see it as such, (the power of your mind being what it is) it will dissolve like a cloud in the sky and touch you not. These days, markets look quite friendly to me whereas before they seemed ominous and terrifying - great punishers and causes for pain. What I see in them now is so different! They kind of mirror my own life in that they depend on cooperation and inter-dependence. It's a peaceful picture! And how could such a picture be a cause for fear? Ok...so much for the mind reformation! I had to give an account of myself on that because I haven't been posting much. I've been quite busy with it in that it's a night &amp; day kind of project! My next post will show how you might be able to find good H&amp;R setups across markets - which ones are more likely to produce something, etc...

Finding trade-worthy markets: In earlier posts I described the basic premise behind the HAC line. Basically, it's a place where crowd wisdom has arrived at a kind of equilibrium. Anyway I thought more and more about the places where traders focus their attention. I looked at trendlines, for example, and found that on D1 charts, H1 &amp; H4 trades frequently occurred almost exactly on trendline breaks of D1. But there is another place where traders focus attention - the closing price. So I studied the effects of the closing price of the Synergy APB indicator. I like this form of candlestick because it takes into account various factors and collects them into a pretty reliable place. At any rate, what I found was that if the HAC line is very close to yesterday's Synergy close, that market should produce some good setups. Also, if at some point during the day the HAC line draws near to that area, it will most likely produce a setup. The timeframes that have their HAC line near or on that Synergy close should be the ones to focus on. If the HAC line begins the day near or right on the Synergy close, there's a good chance that the move will begin just after the open. Sometimes it waits until later, perhaps during the London or New York session. To illustrate: In this example, the place where the D1 Synergy close from the previous day was marked on the current day's chart. H1 had its green HAC line there and M15 had its red HAC there.

Hi Kris - good to "see" you still going strong

--- 帖子 #453 ---
A few days later another decent/clean setup happened on M15. M15 red HAC matched the green H1 perfectly and were exactly on the Synergy close from the previous day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #454 ---
The following day it happened to the long side with the same kind of scenario Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Two days after that it happened on the short side. It was a Sunday, but look what happened! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #456 ---
If the previous one was missed, it set up again on H1 the next day and also on M15 again. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
It never really setup again until the bottom of the daily swing - there was some crappy M15 interaction the day before, but it was probably a little too choppy for anyone to want to trade it. Anyway, here's what it looked like at the bottom: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks Go5! Yeah, I've had my 'moments' over the last year especially, but I've come through. I've even managed to collect $1000 for a trading account despite everything else I very nearly stepped away from this entirely, but a few people from the board PM'd me and kept me going. Many thanks to them!

--- 帖子 #459 ---
After the market raced up for awhile it paused and took a rest. At the resumption of the trend it setup again with a similar scenario - M15 red &amp; H1 Green Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #460 ---
After the big run up, the market became really choppy and there weren't any clean setups that were close to the Synergy close. But after it futzed around for about 3-4 days, a setup developed that produced something clean. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

After awhile it setup again for another short. This one took place in the middle of the day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If anyone has some ideas as to how this might be made most efficient, I'd love to hear them. For instance, if the pairs could be sorted by their proximity of their HAC lines to the Synergy close, etc... or maybe there's something else better. Anyway, if you think this notion of mine has merit, give it some thought and maybe we can create a sort of "trade finder" or something. Get the best ideas together and I'll ask FerruFX what he'll charge to program it.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Almuten, nice to hear from you again! Would you explain more about what synergy is? Is it an indicator? Or is it a trading system someone has made up? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hey Timo, What it is, is a version of the Heiken-Ashi candle. The main difference, as far as I can tell, is that when calculating the closing price for the candle, the actual market close is given an additional weight. For instance, the calculation is as follows: (((Open+High+Low+Close)/4)+Close))/2 The formula was devised by Dean Malone. He also came up with the TDI indicator.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Thanks Almuten, I have done some quick back testing with your latest idea, and it looks like it sure has merit! Some kind of table or dashboard indicator to monitor all pairs for that particular setup would be really good, for sure.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Something helpful to play with... I've worked to improve my timing as far as trades go and the more I work with this, the more I like it. I first learned of it over on Forexalien's thread. It's called the 'Drake Delayed Stochastic.' Originally the idea for this indicator came from the need to filter out false alarms for the spread of infectious diseases (believe it or not). It's used in the evaluation of trends in statistics, but it works very nicely for a cyclical indicator as well, as significant tops and bottoms will be made along with the Drake. What I have attached here is both a non-repainting and repainting version of it. I like the non-repainting one. Generally these are the same, but I like the idea of when an indicator 'prints,' what it prints stays printed the way it originally was. That's just me though. I've just noticed that there are many times, especially during a complex correction, a prolonged topping/bottoming situation or even an ABC pattern, a lot of false signals can be given. This filters out at least half of them. In most cases, for instance, the market won't turn until the Drake reaches at least couple of periods into the Overbought/Oversold zones. Once it crosses and heads the other way, you can be confident that price won't turn again until it reaches the other side of the indicator window. It's not foolproof of course, but it comes reasonably close, provided the rest of the criteria for a good setup are present. Settings: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I know I'm starting to proliferate indicators, which I really wanted to avoid altogether, but as I've worked with this system for two years, I've discovered that even though there are only a couple of indicators, they produce a lot of information to process. Actual trade entry takes a different kind of focus and concentration. Having an indicator that's telling me "Hey!....Get ready now!..." is rather helpful. It helps me to be less reactive and to take my time and watch it set up. This isn't what I want to watch for finding trade setups. It's one of the last things to be used prior to pulling the trigger. As you've probably noticed, there are times when the RAC indy crosses 80 or 20 and the HAC is penetrated, etc... and everything looks perfect, but alas! The market was not quite ready. Situations like that are greatly helped by the Drake, especially if carefully observing multiple TF's for 'cleanness' is difficult. One of the more powerful setups using this indicator is when the lines cross each other and the other H&amp;R criteria occur within a few periods. Example 1: When it's "perfect" Attached Image (click to enlarge) Example 2: When it's "not-so-perfect" In this example, the Drake and RAC were a bit out of sync. The Drake was ready to head North and the RAC was preparing to go South. The H&amp;R signal itself was fine, but the market wasn't ready. It went sideways at the point of entry until it was.

Hi, Almuten! You always blow up some fucking bomb when you show up in your thread. That' s cool!

--- 帖子 #469 ---
A great indicator! Especially the version of DDS_GPRT. If possible, put the version in mq4 or output the buffers 0,1,2. It would be great to add more different notifications and alerts, when crossing levels and / or crossing lines. (Google translate)

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi fastinv, I don't know the coding for the non-repainting version. The guy who originally coded is 'Permalex.' You might try to PM him and see if he will give the code. He's done a couple of other Drake indys with different configurations and some of them have the code available.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Thanks Rammstein!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I managed to hack someone else's code and calculate the Synergy close for D1, W1 &amp; MN and plot them. Anyway, they work perfectly as far as I can tell. Blue = D1 Red = W1 Green = MN Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hey Almuten, any progress, or success with your trading? Any updates? I my self have been trying out your methods, but mainly on back test and mainly on daily timeframe. I would love to have a daily method that wold succeed so I can have time to "live" and have a trading income also.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Timo, Over the last few months I've been readjusting my life to accomodate trading. I live in the United States and the best hours are of course during the London session. Problem was, my life was mostly conducted during the daytime. Fortunately I began a job that has the hours that begin at 3pm and end at 1:30am. Trading gets more active around 2-2:30 am. I really wanted to get accustomed to a more nocturnal schedule before I begin this. All that aside, I'm going to try something that might help you simplify your own trading. I don't know if it will be optimal, but it looks promising. I'm trying to stick to longer time frames now because I am working full time and really love what I'm doing (meaning I don't feel like I have to 'escape' from working). Also, my account size doesn't justify spending all day squeezing pips out of smaller moves that last an hour or two. It just doesn't fit me anymore and I didn't feel any joy from doing it. Moreover, I found that it tired me rather quickly and I lost the alertness I needed to take the appropriate actions consistently. For me, I think H4 is the right time frame to focus on. It doesn't take very long to check 12-18 markets either. This is only a screening method though, nothing more. Once a trade opportunity is seen, it can be managed according to all the other rules previously discussed. Below is a screenshot of what I'm using. Notice there's no RAC on there. I wanted this to be as simple as possible and with little ambiguity. I employed the help of another student of Forexalien's. His name is Nihilist. Like me, he took Alien's ideas and integrated them into indicators that worked well for him. One of his indy's called (playfully) "Holy Grail" happens to coincide nicely with clean RAC crossings so I decided for simplicity's sake to use it as a screening criteria. The other screening criteria, and the first one I look at, is the one that Rammenstein made for me. It's an oscillator based on the distance between the close and the HAC line. The ATR both above and below are on there too. Once the indy pops above the ATR I look then to the Holy Grail to see if it has turned either blue or green. If so, the market is in a good long position. When the indy turns negative and is below the ATR line, I look to the Holy Grail to see if it is either orange or red. If so, the market is in a good short position. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have to dash off to work now, but maybe once I get going I can start posting the setups when they occur.

New Adjustments in Life and Other Cool Stuff Well life has changed once again. Just as I was getting used to being up at night, etc... I lost my job...AGAIN! Now I've just $65 in my trading account. Other 'fun' things have been happening too! Get this. I ran into a deer a month ago. My hood was crushed so I couldn't open it. Three weeks ago I lost my job. Two weeks ago my car battery died in the middle of a busy intersection and because I can't get the hood open, well...no car now. Anyway, I'm walking a LOT these days - about 6-10 miles a day. The wonderful thing is, I am finally at a place where all of this is 100% ok with me. I think I just completed my life's work: complete acceptance of whatever occurs. There seems to be a kind of divine grace operating through all this. It's been quite extraordinary. Anyway... because I have so little money to work with right now, my main focus has been on continuing to develop methods, understand my tools better, etc... I do have some exciting developments (at least I think so). I have a way of using the RAC indy that's rather unique and I think it might be a way of finding very good monthly-level trades; meaning trades that run for days or weeks.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
RAC as a predictive tool for price: The logic behind this is that the smaller time frames will lead the larger; that patterns made in them will repeat in the larger structure. To obtain some idea of this I've been using the RAC indy to establish a key oscillator level for one month at a time. But first, seeing what this indy is really like will lend some credibility to it. For example, take the 50% level. Mark on the chart every time the RAC crossed 50%. Watch how many times price will cross those levels when the RAC crosses 50% is rather astonishing. It's like it keeps track of the 'balance' of the market somehow. This kind of thing will occur over even months at times. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Now the next thing I want to show you is that the indicator can potentially be used to map out a month's worth of price movement using the first five minutes of the month. The RAC on the lower time frame will translate into significance on the larger time frame. First I'll put on what's done on M5. The RAC level is marked in the oscillator window and the opening price is also marked. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Now I change the chart to an H1. Just notice what happens with the RAC on that time frame crosses the level marked out by M5. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also look at H4. Same kind of thing, only it happens later. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Now this part is really cool. It will confirm whether or not the trade is perfect; at least as perfect as could be expected. Now that we have the levels set up, I'm going to use H1 to find the setups. This time frame will make enough swings on a monthly basis that really great setups can be located. 1. The trend line begins on the monthly open. 2. point #2 is drawn on the close whenever the RAC crosses the key level. In the pic below, the RAC made 2 crosses on H1, but one of them is more important because, as marked by the pink arrow, it crossed again and intersected the trendline. This is what makes that line all-important. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hit #4 In this example, the TL was hit yet again, just as the RAC was crossing the key level. This is an extremely UNLIKELY event. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now we can measure how far it ought to go. On a fresh run, the typical target is 3x. This one went much, much further on H1. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #481 ---
And now is the H4 chart. It's not really a 'perfect setup' like H1 and I wouldn't trade it this way, but given H1 was so perfect I used H4 as a measuring device. Pretty much nailed 3x to the pip. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Here's another setup going the other way in September. This one hit 5-6 times on the same trendline before moving lower. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And here's the 3x target reached in early October Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
H4 Projection Like the previous example, this one also had a nice H4 projection - a 3x to the pip. In this case, a high was made just as the H4 RAC crossed the key level. To my mind, this establishes some importance. Anyway, the projection was made on the close when the key level was crossed to the downside. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Thanks for sharing your latest, Almuten, I wish you all the best, have a merry Christmas, (I hope that is possible, in your situation), and hope to hear more from you on this thread in the new year. God bless you, and I know things will pick up for you soon. Hang in there!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Thanks Timo! I guess this is just part of my sojourn through life...not knowing from one day to the next what will occur. But, if I really consider it, that's how trading is. So in some ways, I'm just being prepared for it all the more. It's all good and I've no complaints. I'm fortunate that I've been able to focus on something other than external "troubles." I have a nice computer and a nice office to work in ( a friend lets me use one in a building that her and her husband own) and I live with people who can use some help here and there with their lives. That's how this has all been working out from one day to the next. It's been a series of miracles, really. It's hard to imagine being any happier! Happy New Year to all!

--- 帖子 #486 ---
A Helpful Tool I've been perusing on Forexalien's thread lately and happened across a nice indicator - a multi TF Drake Stochastic (more on this later). Anyway, I modified the code a bit and made a multi-TF HAC line. I have two versions, each having 4 lines. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This one matches the red HAC to the green on the next higher TF. For example: TF 1 RED to TF 2 Green And... TF2 Red to TF 3 Green There are buttons on it to turn them on and off. Attached File(s) AA_HAC_Line V1.04-Matcher.mq4 16 KB | 353 downloads This next one plots up to 4 HAC lines, each with its own button to turn it on and off. Many thanks to Emonts over at Forexalien's thread for this! I don't have that much talent to do this entirely myself. Attached File(s) AA_HAC_Line V1.04.mq4 16 KB | 354 downloads I also made a MTF RAC indy as well using the same bit of code. I rather like this! Attached File(s) AA_MTF_RAC_Line V1.04.mq4 16 KB | 370 downloads

--- 帖子 #487 ---
I just remembered that I had to put a different source file for the HAC calculation. It does the same thing as the "HAC_v0.200[KristopherStreeter]" one. I just couldn't get the original to work because I don't have the mt4 file for it. Anyway, here it is: Attached File(s) ###HAC.mq4 2 KB | 387 downloads

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I have been experimenting with the MTF RAC line indicators, and I'm not sure the best way to use them. How are you using them Almuten? Which TF do you scan the charts with? And what do you watch for? Do you wait until all four lines come close to each other and price crosses them? Thanks, and hope your doing well.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi Timo! What I wanted to do was place all the info for multiple TFs on a single chart because it would be easier to manage (at least in theory). At the very least it could offer a quicker, cleaner view of the relationships between TFs. Also, I think with a bit of practice and discernment, one could jump into a longer term trade a bit earlier. I'll give some examples. In the chart below is the GBPJPY on M15. I have the HAC MTF indy and the RAC MTF indy. I'll go over a few days and tell you how I see this. The green lines are for M15 Red lines are H1 Yellow lines are H4 To reduce confusion I switched off the D1 on both the HAC and RAC On Jan 2nd the situation was as follows: 1st half of the day: H4 - very strong - RAC &gt; 80 and sloping up H1 - same as H4 M15 - &gt; 80 intermittently Later the M15 RAC crossed below 80 and then H1 also crossed down, but H4 was showing no signs of degrading. The M15 didn't even make it to 3x, but was 5 pips shy of it. A bit later a cross above 20 on M15 happened, but it was not touching the HAC line so it's a dubious situation. H1 was ok because its RAC line was sloping up while its HAC was touched by price. But still, it's a dubious situation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Jan 3rd a similar scenario unfolded with H4 &gt; 80, H1 &gt; 80 and M15 RAC crossing below 80. The high exceeded the previous day's high by only a few pips and another short was initiated. This time it hit a 4x target for M15. Another useful thing about this is that you can monitor hits to the HAC line for 'bounce trades.' For instance, the market hit the H4 HAC line while the H4 RAC was &gt; 80. Combined with the fact that M15 had just hit a 4x profit target, this could be a decent area to take a long on the cheap. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next day we see the M15 set up for a trade. Indications are great for a long position for the following reasons: 1. H4 HAC bounce the day before 2. H4 RAC &gt; 80 3. H1 RAC &gt; 50 This one took until the following day to hit 3x. Along the way, the M15 RAC (green), overtook H1 and H4, which is a great sign that it will continue on. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On Jan 8th there was a nice, clean crossing down of the H&amp;R on M15. Other indications are for market strength though because H4 RAC &gt; 80, H1 &gt; 80. Best not to get greedy on the short side. On the long side, there was an H1 'bounce' trade. The H1 RAC &gt; 80 while the H1 HAC was penetrated. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Jan 9th - this is the kind of ideal scenario that you want to find; a quick, cascading of triggers from one TF to the next. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But since H4 was involved, I'll put on the D1 and see its relationship to everything. You can see that the H4 RAC has now crossed below D1 RAC (pink line). This means that it could be pulling the D1 down lower, as shorter TFs lead the higher. For this reason, we can put on a 3x H4 target along with H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Running until the 10th, the market bounced neatly off the 3x H4 profit target. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But observe that the D1 HAC was penetrated while its RAC was well above 80. In itself, it's a good reason to believe it will bounce up for a good long position. It was beginning to slope down though, but still, the argument is for a long, especially after H4 had just hit a major profit target. So now we look for confirmation of that from the lower TFs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Jan 11th On this day the market futzed around, trying to build a long position, etc... The first opportunity would've been a loss of around 45 pips. After that it was clear sailing. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Jan 12th M15 and H1 both triggered. H1 had a late RAC crossing, but in some instances this is ok. It's when there's no real resistance going the other way. In this case, we already had a H4 target reached, along with a D1 bounce forecast, so I'd excuse it. Nevertheless, M15 triggered nicely. 3x target on that was 152 pips. 4x was 204 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) H1 profit targets, if they were used, looked like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) H4 targets would've taken up to the 25th for a 2x target to the pip. Also, I would like to remind people that we try to trade in the direction of H4, especially if there are unrealized profit targets on that TF. That one rule alone would keep us long for the duration. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Jan 25th &amp; 26th On the 25th, a short initiated on M15 for a 2x profit (if it was taken). The H1 triggered late on the RAC, so right there is a reason to think it will reset and test the top. The 26th afforded an ideal opportunity to the short side though. Boom! Boom! Boom! Attached Image (click to enlarge) The profit targets of 4x for M15 and 3x for H1 were reached. Also, notice the 'bounce' trade on D1. RAC &gt; 80 while D1 HAC was hit. This set up for a very nice long on both M15 and H1. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I hope this development is helpful. I just wanted to be able to more easily monitor pairs is all. Same rules apply. It's just an easier way of keeping track of what's happening. Happy Trading to all

It's been quite a while since I've posted much here and largely it's because of so many life changes. Oftentimes the journey to any type of success is full of difficulty, delay, unexpected events, tragedies and the like. I've definitely had a few of those You know, Alien once said that to be a good trader, one also has to be a good person. I thought I was a good person, and maybe in some respects, I was. But deep down inside there was a kind of self-hatred; an abiding guilt that gnawed at me and pulled me down. It was the kind of thing that subconsciously undermined everything I did. I really wanted to rid myself of that because, no matter how hard I worked, no matter how well-developed my methods became, they were never good enough to overcome the fear of losing and the fear of the world, or what the world would do to me if I lost all I had and became destitute. To be truly free; free in mind and free to act in accord to my best interests, I had to overcome that and face it head on. But how? A prayer from the heart always receives an answer. It never fails. I prayed to be healed of all my self-hatred so I could be free at last. Below is what happened on account of that prayer. For about 5 months my car was out of commission because I hit a deer. I had no job or money to get it fixed and the only job I could find within walking distance was working in a nursing home as a server in the dining department. It didn't pay much and for a several months I walked about 5 miles a day just getting to and from work. And then I'd walk another 8-12 miles on the job serving people with Alzheimer's and various disabilities their food. I felt what I was doing was like a living nightmare in many respects. For me, at that time, it was the epitome of failure as a man. I had no idea that I would be building a better foundation; one that would be based on something tangible and real, rather than mere ideas about myself. Over time, as I gradually had my ego busted again and again, I started to appreciate what I was doing. The old people also really loved me and told me so every day. I became very important to them, especially since so many of them were virtually forgotten by their families. It's very hard for families to watch their mothers and fathers become more and more disabled. They just don't know how to relate to them anymore. I know it frightens them to the core. These people have become almost like my own children. They are so dependent, but I deny them nothing and have learned to respond to even their unspoken needs. I can't shut out their cries, no matter how tired I am or how much work I have to do. They often get freaked out because they don't know where they are and have forgotten even their own names sometimes, but if I just stop what I'm doing and sit with them for a little while and listen to them, they don't feel all alone and feel happy again. Sometimes, when they're ready to die, they tell me and I listen to their life review. And then they go. It's like they decide and then let it go completely. In a strange kind of way, they've led me to care for myself more. In hearing their needs, I also hear my own. In forgiving their nasty and angry moments, I forgive my own too. I think most of all what I've learned is to value what's most important. It's to value the love and connection between people because, no matter how grim things appear to be, that can never be lost. It can be forgotten, but never, ever lost. So that's the part of the journey I'm on now. A bit of self-discovery with a dollop of self-forgiveness thrown in. I hope to begin trading in a month or so, as I've managed to save a few hundred dollars over the last 9 months. I think I'm in a good frame of mind because just the other day as I was driving down the road, my hood suddenly flew off my car! With a fraction of a second it was gone to parts unknown (it happened so fast I couldn't even see where it went). Anyway, I just laughed and laughed all the way home. If that had happened a year ago I would've freaked out for sure! I definitely would've been angry at the very least. Given that, I think I'm able to take a loss or two.

I loaded the multi-TF HAC line, but there was only the button on the screen without any lines. Anyone same question? Thank you!

I'll look into it over the next couple of days. I might have to ask FerruFX to look at the code and see what's up.

Ok...I just messaged FerruFX to look at it. I think it's because of the "CyclePeriod" function that both the HAC and RAC are dependent on. It likely needs to be updated to work with the latest MT4 build. That's my guess. I remember when FerruFX programmed these for me he advised me to use another cycle period function - a later version, but it didn't work in my MT4 at the time. I think he was trying to "future proof" it as much as possible.

Hi Timo! Well a lot has changed since the last time I posted. For starters, I moved to northern California in an act of faith. It was funny, but I felt an overwhelming pull to just pack up everything with nothing but $1200 to my name and drive from Kansas City to Eureka, CA. I really don't know why I selected that town, but that's what I did. No plan. No job lined up or anything. I felt like I had to learn to trust my inner guidance and that God would take care of me if only I trusted. I think it was the most scary thing I've ever done, but I felt like if I didn't do it I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I must say that, driving to an unknown place with an uncertain future has certainly made any fear of trading go away! Anyway, one thing followed another and within days I found a great place to live, made friends quickly and survived on odd jobs for the first five months. I never ran out of money and it always came just before I needed it. Then I got a job in a building center, which enabled me to save money to start trading again. I left there just after the Corona outbreak. I haven't had much time to work on trading until very recently. Finally, I think I can breath again and relax long enough to devote the time needed. I work on it all the time and am getting back into the required mindset. I've been re-examining my original ideas because I like the underlying logic behind them. Lately I've been rereading Alien's thread because that's where my original inspiration came from. I guess my trading journey has been a little different than a lot of folks. I've had to heal so much in my mind over the last five years, eliminate fear and learn to live with uncertainty. I've had a lot of psychological problems to confront; problems that trading certainly brings out in a person! I think I'm in a much better position than I've ever been in though. Kris

Well, nice to hear from you Kris, I also "like the underlying logic behind" your ideas, especially the cycles, and the short term, medium and long term cycles aligning up etc. Any way, keep us posted of anything new you come up with. All the best, and keep trading. Build that small account into a big one!

[quote=Almuten;12873260]{quote} Hola Timo! Bueno, muchas cosas han cambiado desde la última vez que publiqué. Para empezar, me mudé al norte de California en un acto de fe. Fue gracioso, pero sentí un impulso abrumador de simplemente empacar todo con nada más que $1200 a mi nombre y conducir desde Kansas City a Eureka, CA. Realmente no sé por qué elegí ese pueblo, pero eso fue lo que hice. Ningún plan. No hay trabajo en fila ni nada. Sentí que tenía que aprender a confiar en mi guía interior y que Dios me cuidaría si solo confiaba. Creo que fue lo más aterrador que he hecho, pero sentí que si no lo hacía me arrepentiría por el resto de mi vida. ¡Debo decir que conducir a un lugar desconocido con un futuro incierto ciertamente ha hecho desaparecer cualquier miedo al comercio! De todos modos, una cosa siguió a la otra y en cuestión de días encontré un excelente lugar para vivir, hice amigos rápidamente y sobreviví con trabajos ocasionales durante los primeros cinco meses. Nunca me quedé sin dinero y siempre llegaba justo antes de que lo necesitara. Luego conseguí un trabajo en un centro de construcción, lo que me permitió ahorrar dinero para comenzar a operar nuevamente. Me fui de allí justo después del brote de Corona. No he tenido mucho tiempo para trabajar en el comercio hasta hace muy poco. Finalmente, creo que puedo respirar de nuevo y relajarme lo suficiente como para dedicar el tiempo necesario. Trabajo en ello todo el tiempo y estoy volviendo a la mentalidad requerida. He estado reexaminando mis ideas originales porque me gusta la lógica subyacente detrás de ellas. Últimamente he estado releyendo el hilo de Alien porque de ahí vino mi inspiración original. Supongo que mi viaje comercial ha sido un poco diferente al de mucha gente. Tuve que sanar mucho en mi mente durante los últimos cinco años, eliminar el miedo y aprender a vivir con la incertidumbre. He tenido que enfrentar muchos problemas psicológicos; ¡Problemas que el comercio ciertamente trae a la persona! Sin embargo, creo que estoy en una posición mucho mejor que nunca. Kris[/cita] Almuten, hope everything is going well to you. Here I left some images.
