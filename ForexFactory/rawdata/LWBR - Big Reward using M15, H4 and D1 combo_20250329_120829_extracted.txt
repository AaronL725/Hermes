GBPAUD +2.08R Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPCAD SL hit on monday market gap -1R

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Can you explain in a bit more detail how the trend is "clearer"? Interesting that you use all green candles on the higher time frames. I really don't see how the color will affect my trading; in the video, he shows the color as preventing an entry and also an early exit. For me, in a way I do use a single color while in a trade; for example, here is the EURUSD last Friday. Bearish bias during the Asian session, if a short trade is entered, the bearish bias can quite easily be seen for the rest of the day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

HK50.. Closing half at +2.1R and another +2.3R still running. Price moved too fast, didn't manage to add. Target at D1 SR zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I still don't get it; when a trader takes the signal from a higher time frame eg. a daily Pin Bar or a 4-Hour inside bar, you make a huge assumption that all traders will simply exit the trade on 15M because they might see a different color candle or tiny Pin Bar. Really speculative thesis IMHO. Anyway, that's aside from the actual system, good luck.

It is time for another Monthly Update... Total profit for the month is +54.79R with 34% Win rate Average Trade is +3.15R. Of the total 139 trades taken, only 7 trades resulting for more than +5R Average trade RR without the home run trades is +2.29R. Three losing streaks period with 9, 7 and 13 losing trades. Expectancy is +0.394R Biggest Loss on single trade is -2.46R (Overtraded) Largest Win on a single trade is +12.49R Such low win rate caused by me always looking for a home run trade, many trades hit breakeven or turned into loser after floating more than +1.5R in profit. I need to find the balance on selecting which trade to close on small profit vs which one to get on into home run trade.

What session do you usually trade? Do you set to BE at a certain pips profit and/or trail SL?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I trade HK50, JP225, CHINA50, AUD, NZD, JPY Pairs on Asian Session and everything else after London Open. I often set to BE after +1.5R, but I prefer to add more on winning position and move SL tighter to keep the same risk level on the trade.

BTCUSD almost hit TP but hit SL instead.. -1R

EURAUD similar to AUDCHF, d1 is on some sort of fake breakout/stophunt... entered on pullback via m15. Scaled in for big RR Target on H4 SR

--- 帖子 #121 ---
AUDNZD.. I like trading this one because this pair don't really correlate much with any other pairs. D1 stophunt, entered on EMA cross. Still deciding on the target, either on nearest H4 SR(+1.8R) or a breakout(+4R)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Closed manually +2.07R... Attached Image (click to enlarge) So I decide to remove TP and hold for Swing since price bounce off Support level and most likely D1 will end up as an Engulfing bar.

CHFJPY it may seem like a good long setup but if you look at H4 it is on SR zone and D1 was a huge bear bar so no long for this pair

Never thought about it, just googled for HA and thicker bar chart. I think a candlestick with "less wick" might be better, but I have no idea if such indicator exist. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Try this one. Attached File(s) Heiken Ashi AutoWidth button.mq4 8 KB | 242 downloads Note: After adding this Heiken Ashi indicator to your chart, do the following: Right click on MT4. Click on Properties. Set Line graph to 'None'. Click OK. Then go to line graph to get a clean view of the Heiken Ashi candles. If you want to see the underlying Japanese candlesticks, then switch to the candlestick setting in MT4 and use the Show/Hide button for the Heiken Ashi indicator. I think you may like this approach more.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Try this. Attached File(s) thickwick.mq4 5 KB | 251 downloads This one is best viewed on line graph. But be sure to set line graph to 'None' (in properties). After adding this indicator to your chart, go into the settings of the indicator and set 'Wick' to 4.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
wow here2there how do you come up with such great indicators so quickly... The level 4 wick is definitely less distracting, what do you think? Also is it okay for you if I repackage the indicators and share it with other members? Thank you so much!

Feinan, 1 technical qn. 1) How can I get the same screen as you do? One screen that has D1, H4 and M15 charts. Or you screenshot 3 times and paste for our easy reference? 2) I can't get the orange and red histogram. Is there a template? Or what is the indicator name?

Hi again kedridder. 1. arrange your layout to something like this, and press the ON OFF button on the m15 chart to hide the borders. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. The indicator name is Absolute Strength histogram with : Attached Image Im on Discord right now i can help you setup your chart. Cheers

I have been learning mql4 coding since past month. Made this amateur looking indicator that help with risk management. It shows the allowed $ per trade in fixed amount or in percentage of the account balance. SL to Risk $$ is very helpful when adding multiple positions and calculate the SL price that match the $ amount. And also I added alert when it reaches X amount of loss per day and force you to close the platform Still has couple of bugs that I don't know how to fix yet.

I've been trying to trade a small account($500) since Oct 1st. I noticed that it is impossible to have perfect risk management because the of the minimum lot size.. To have a perfect sizing you must have at least $3000.. You could try micro or cent account but the spreads are wider than Raw spread or ECN. Risk for each setup should be in fixed number of dollar or percentage of the account balance and never risk more than 1% of your account.. Feinan

Hi there is an Absolute Strength Histogram indicator file on the LWBR V7 template package, try add the indicator manually with these settings: Attached Image D1 bias is overall trend or candlestick pattern.

Hi feinan, nice system. Do you still set your initial SL according the 1,0 - 1,5 x H1 ATR or do you look on swings on M15?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Yes, around 1,0 to 1,75 x H1 ATR. Mostly Trend following by identifying the bias using H4 and D1 chart. You can use EMA5 and EMA13 crossover for entry or add more position on the pullback.

-1R and +2.89R... there is no right way to trade a trend, sometimes they just want to stop you out first.. All you can do is try again, add to the winner to negate the loss.

Hi Feinan. A very thorough looking system. Question: Do you manually arrange the 3 charts with different TF's or is there a template for that?

Been a while since i check this Thread, The owner is pretty busy now and barely check his discord group, and it died down, One thing for sure is that his trade strategy is pretty good, Used this strategy in ASIAN session with lower timeframe, some minor tweek, but same EMAs , Dragon EMA now, im pretty much consistent with it, Thanks Feinan
