PRIORI or POSTERIORI  pt49 your post deserves to be the start of the thread.
MOVIE button is a miracle idea. like D-Theory

when I tell you the status of the MACD for example for all 1000 symbols at less than one second? does it deserve or not?

when you watch expert open all symbols chart, one by one and draw their trends automatically for each pair each 5 seconds while you are laying on your Bed, does it deserve or not?

when you see the current prices related to FIBOS % for all pairs in less than 0.001 second? does it deserve or not?

when you see the S/R arranged according to time and drawn automatically for all pairs, in less than 1 sec? does it deserve or not?

etc.. for another 72 advantages

any way, According to my approach of defining Technical Indicators, they can be categorized under two titles:

Technical indicators are either PRIORI or POSTERIORI

Similarly:
Fundamental Analysis are either SCHEDULED NEWS or UNSCHEDULED NEWS.

Posteriori indicators: like MACD, RSI, etc... we know technical price after "post"
Priori indicators: like TREND-FIBO- R/S etc.. we know technical price before "prior to"
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

for priori indicators: we have 4 buttons, plus RENKO-ZIGZAG

The format must be unified like picture below:

under each button there is RED or ORANGE, and for each case, there is a DASH or TECHNICAL LINES DRAW

the second possible problem is rumtime arrors if any, espicially "divide by 0"

the third possible problem: process speed

the fourth possible problem: wrong logic or wrong output

and so on

at the end expert must be errors-free, agile, accurate etc... the best thing that you can imagine.

now i restart sizing: it is ok now:

Recommended site:
https://school.stockcharts.com/doku....cal_indicators

SAR in old books is a "TREND" indicator:

if price below SAR ===> UP-TREND

if price above SAR ===> DOWN-TREND

some says:
The Parabolic SAR establish the direction of the trend.
Then use use alternative indicators to measure the strength of the trend.
I accept this statement
Others say: use it as a StopLoss.
also I accept that

Each SAR icon, we can make many SAR functions following our tradtional style of programming.

like what we did with instruments-group. "single icon with multi-functions"

my own idea: use the SAR as:

1- StopLoss if there is any reversal

2- trend determiner
3- trading on touch of SAR point--do not wait for next candle. -- new idea
4- TP: when "SAR-now" reaches the value of "SAR during our entry" -- new idea

--- 帖子 #17 ---
it may close on profit or even on loss.

and our stoploss will be the low after SAR status change.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Trailing StopLoss: the lowest low of any new candles after any RED candles has been confirmed, with value higher than prev. SL when 6 candles pass after that low confirmation.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
1- Select any group
2- Make OnTrading Green
3- Activate any frame

then trading will start

we postpone safety-gears to the end!

Concept of A1 (old version BED3) : "What is the most volatile pair last x day/s"
x days range from current day till 62 days ago.

it is the percnetage or pips changes

As mentioned in previous thread please find attached an Indicator based EA which made lots of profit circa 2009-2015, to this day it works but nowadays trades are far and few. If you do back test you can get 95%+ accuracy depending on settings. This tell me the indicator is still good but may need modification (static to dynamic ?) for current/future market conditions. Please enjoy

Edit: Forex factory will not allow me to upload the .dll file which is required unless those with programming experience can get around or I can provide .dll file with a recommended hosting/upload company.

Edit 2: please see mega upload link with missing .dll file.

You are a master of visualization.

Will appreciate it if you can develop a user-friendly tool (not for trading) but for exploring probabilities and past patterns.

I mentor retirees free of cost as part of a non-profit community organistion.

I have done a free simple course of buying options for risk-averse investors. I have sent you the link by PM.

Now I am developing a simple course for trading futures for them to use it to make passive income.

I will appreciate your help.

I base most of my decisions on data. The course will focus on using skills and lean pockets to generate part-time income.

Scalping with non-directional bias needs to keep the brain active and with no confusion. It will be based on the 1-year demo trades used by the retiree learners using their own skills of planning trades following patterns detected by the attached past statistics excel sheet generating indicator. I have attached mql.

They are doing well trading manually with no directional bias. But finding it difficult to trade enough to make a decent income.

It is for them I have planned a futures trading course with the theme of Mind and Machine.

Plan like a human, trade like a machine is my core method where I plot trades manually on demand (no preparation is needed) and restrict myself to the role of a machine operator who will start the machine at a time when my brain gives me signals by identifying suitable spots to deploy the machine.

The machine will never be used for generating signals. Only for executing trades rapidly.

Algo bots work with speed to execute trades quickly and rapidly. Execution is set with a system of Entry and Exit using past data and patterns for trade planning.

The advantage of using a machine is that your mind remains in control of the situation and is free to see how the price action is moving the market and arousing emotions. You will have to thank the machine for affording you the freedom to think and plan locations where the machine needs to work.

Machines can facilitate capturing a sizable portion of a price range formed by price movements moving in increments of tiny sizes in such a way that unless they reach a size that can be traded in a cost-efficient manner, you can't trade. You can’t trade 2 or 4 or even 6 pips movements because the buying and selling spread plus broker fee at any time is more than 6 pips. Economical trade size should be one that can cover spread, broker fee and leave at least 60% of gains as net income.

The results from one year of manual trading of fixed size grids is astounding. I don't know Excel or any programming language. I have been helped by FF member BlueRain for producing the statistics indicator. I am now requesting to improve the statistics indicator to catch Buy Low and Sell High (Buy Limit) and Sell High and buy low statistics.

When you make a count of 1440 bars, each moving in a single minute generates from 0 to 30 points for DAX index and end up open to close with a total of 148 points in 1440 minutes of trading. It is amazing that the length of the one minute price candle traveled - up, down & sideways - covering 21,265 points while ending the day (1440) minutes at an average return of only 148 points or less than one-quarter percent of the sum total of 21,255 points.

It can be compared to the making of home made condensed milk - thick and creamy where milk is boiled, simmered and reduced to some kind of a thick paste. Volatility is like boiling or simmering milk.

You will be able to visually see how the price levels zig zag, changing directions at various times, giving no idea whether it is traveling up or down or is lost in the traffic (volume) but the retirees in one year practice of catching trades manually are not finding it difficult to do.

Trades with smaller sizes that naked eyes may not be able to detect easily and conclude all such ranges as No Trades in small price movement zones were being detected by the traders with an effort and strain on eyes. They made a profit from them but not so much because human execution of trades continuously has big limitations. Planning pending trades manually and very quickly is not feasible. Only a bot can help in executing trades like a machine gun shooting bullets rapidly. It is not martingale trading. Fixed lots are traded. Not of variable size and certainly not with doubled or tripled like martingale requires.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Any grid trading EA (not martingale one) should be able to get the most out of it before it is reduced to the daily average range. I am working on getting a simple grid trader coded.

I derive edge from historical statistics gathered (not patterns) . Specifically, that help in determining entry size, TP size, Stop loss size, the frequency of pullbacks happening on the long side and low side. The theme is Buy Low, Sell High or Sell High Buy Low. 85% of the time market consolidates or trades in ranges. So my focus is on identifying the Sideways market by known active hours, measuring Outliers in pip sizes and the counting frequency in M1 chart on a daily basis. Measurement is by PIPs. No moving average or any oscillator is used.

Presently, the Intention is to find out the past frequency of Sideways market: what are active hours to trade; and during active hours how many times pullbacks or retracement takes place, how many times Repurchases or Resells happen (you can call it revisits as well price moves counted within a defined xxx pips range).
Identify Outlier bars: Positive Bulls and negative Bears by bar size-frequency and hours it is happening.

Link between the Outlier bar (Accumulation phase) and smaller bars ( Distribution phase) on the frequency and hours of frequent happening, Pips gathered Positive Bulls and negative bears in defined time.

1440 bars collect data but I don't know how to filter or manipulate data to get desired statistics or insert the columns and fields.

Swing size calculation is quite important as an input to feed the grid bot.

Swing size should be such that it can happen rapidly.

Manually, during one year of demo testing by retiree/elderly traders, they were selecting a range by looking at the chart after the a big movement of at least 30% of daily high low has happened. They then assume sideways will move for 1/3 of it or 10% of the day range. Then they break down 10% in 4 ranges and see if each grid size is cost-effective. That method worked very well except that they find it consumes a lot of their time on watching the screen as well as only trading manually.

This method of scalping or day trading requires only finding Outliers (big candles) and wait for brekout or breakdown to pass away. The elderly enjoy this kind of less stressful trading in a systematic way without doing any kind of analysis. The elderly also find that this kind of trading gives their brain work to do and is stimulating.

No need to analyze news except to keep an eye on the data calendar and keep count of events to avoid situations where trending can happen and not trade.

Focus is on trading in a non-trending environment.

No technical analysis is required. No oscillators or dependency on indicators is needed. The elderly have their own reasons for using brains rather than depend on signals.

The Sideways statistics collection is important. Most important is to collect data on revisits being made to certain price levels. This helps planning the size of entry and exit, size of equity loss or stop loss. When market is waiting for job report the consolidation lasts for hours altogether. You may think there is no trade happening but the retiree traders made most of their profit stress-free finding ways to trade small trades. It is during such trading, they found some price levels are revisited often. For instance, one trader used 30 points High Low range and divided into 3 grids , each of 10 points. He found that during six hours of consolidation, some prive levels were visited 50 times. which means 1 trade is able to generate 50 trades, each of 10 pips profit, total sum being 500 pips. This kind of observation was made by them and that is when I realised how useful a simple grid EA can be useful.

we have two kinds of instruments:

1) Dollaric pairs

2) Non-dollaric pairs, which average people  name it crosses---from now and on we will call it MATH-pairs

we assume dollaric pairs (any pair include USD) the most liquid market pairs. therefore any other math pair.

any math pair is actually an equation of related twp USD pairs.

some of them are multiplication , some are division

some are direct BASE/QOUTE

some are inverse Quote/Base

DIRECT = D

INVERSE = I

MULTIPLY = M

DIVIDE = D

then we have 4 possible config:
M-D
M-I
D-I
D-D

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Examples:

EURGBP is D-D----REASON: EURGBP=EURUSD/GBPUSD -- DIRECT DIVISIION

AUDCAD is M-D ---- Reason: AUDCAD = AUDUSD*USDCAD

CHFJPY is D-I ----- Reason: CHFJPY = USDJPY/USDCHF

look CHF which is BASE is in the denominator in equation (inverse)

Dear Al-Otaibi,

Regarding to the CALC, i checked the CALC-RED and CALC-ORANGE.

CALC-RED is OK

But with CALC-ORANGE (extreme case based on pair velocity), there are some places which are completely different from my calculation.

This is one of them: case ++ of CHFJPY
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is my calculation for case ++ of CHFJPY

CHFJPY = CHFUSD/JPYUSD = pair_B/pair_Q

pair_B = CHFUSD = 1/USDCHF

pair_Q = JPYUSD = 1/USDJPY

CHFJPY = CHFUSD/JPYUSD = pair_B / pair_Q = (1/USDCHF) / (1/USDJPY) = (1/0.92872) / (1/115.760) = 124.645

pair_B+ = CHFUSD+ = 1/USDCHF+ = 1/[USDCHF + (USDCHF*100*0.0001)] = 1/[0.92872 + (0.92872*100*0.0001)] = 1.06609

pair_Q+ = JPYUSD+ = 1/USDJPY+ = 1/[USDJPY + (USDJPY*0.01)] = 1/[115.760 + (115.760*0.01)] = 0.00855

++ = [(pair_B+ / pair_Q+) - CHFJPY]*100 = [(1.06609 / 0.00855) - 124.645]*100 = 4.4

==========

Please correct me if i am wrong.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #229 ---

Thank you Phu,

I've installed and run EA as per 1st-page instructions. It has opened a few trades and Free-margin is negative. Yes, I read Mohammad's solution (I think justice to increase margin so i will read study again and fix problems one by one) in the thread but now I've to implement that solution in practice.

Anyway, I'm posting a screenshot to let you know that I'm in with you guys but I'll take time to study thread and software and practice it silently as I'm not as young as you are  so my brain is slow.

Cheers.

you mean good waste of time.

i do not even read it.

to test and analyze you must first do in 1 minute what others do in 2 years.

that can not be achieved without help of programming.

otherwise your test/analysis is nothing at all, even if you think it is valuable.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
The indicator analyses price movements in 1 minute for 1440 minutes.

Being an Excel expert, I was hoping from you to add a few columns to help filter the frequency of pullbacks, continuation, the re-visits to the price level based on very narrow ranges grid sizes threshold and in certain times so that the least amount of margin can be used to maximise returns.

I have no commercial agenda, so all the indicators/EAs I upload are with full source mql because it benefits mainly the coding learners. My non-profit organisation hires at least 10-year-experienced coders to do the job of suitable EAs for retirees and pay them money. I want the learners to get the benefit of the way experienced coders code. Mql will not help traders but will help the coding beginners.

My belief system is different and I can not say that others should also follow that. However, no harm in giving a reality check.

If you are on FF, you think you can build an audience to sell your services. Thousands of free indicators and EAs are available for free. Hundreds of programmers launched their online ventures in the past but ventures did not work.  Signals, copy trades, nothing works because of the nature of the financial trading.

It MAJORLY needs brain management and sufficient risk money.  Without understanding this basic thing, delusional programmers will keep trying their luck. No harm in playing any kind of video games.

Fortunately, a few freelance sites like mql5  provide some opportunity to make $30 to $40 if they are given the idea by any experienced trader with rules and logic. It attracts programmers who are really looking for holy grail and not money for their time.

Surprisingly, I can't find even ONE programmer at any of freelance sites, who knows trading and has Excel proficiency.. Because it is easier for them to use technical indicators libraries. And not use their own brains to figure out what to filter, which kind of thresholds to apply, to arrive at frequencies figures. Secretly, they themselves are hoping that they will find holy grail EAS. Some of them have lost heavily by their misplaced beliefs that EAs can generate money without having any trading experience.

It is like you want to get a sports medal without really having given any time for exercises.

BlueRain is a programmer with exception ability - a rate kind of programmer - who was active on FF like a breeze for hardly 12 months. He is not active anymore and will not touch even the indictor and the spreadsheet on which he spent at least 100 hours coding it for the elderly traders at my request, without accepting payment.

1440 minutes analysis is done mainly - though you can use it maximum up to 4 hours for index selected by you.  I only use 1440 minutes for planning entry size, using hot hours, and for immediate forward testing (or actual trading) estimate pullbacks, continuation, ideal trading size which not only covers trading costs, but which can generate around 2 % of contract size gains (leverage returns will be exponential) by trading 1 minutes bars for non-neutral grid trading.

I don't need signals because I use my experience to detect Sideways or compressed range environments.

It's a challenge for your coding abilities. Can you do it?

So far I have not come across a single indicator that can be a sort of leading indicator (not a lagging one) for Sideways movements.

If you can create a dynamic Sideways indicator to identify the entry points for pullbacks, range trading, compressed range trading, then you can have a profitable EA that generates signals based on Sideways. Breakouts have good indicators. But I have not found any for Sideways forecast or assumption.

It will be a challenge for your coding ability to code a Sideways indicator that prints highlighter or forms a dynamic box based on previous candle movements measured by thresholds defined by the trader (not just imagination) but from studying probability statistics generated by the frequency of steady price moves in 1-minute moves made by looking at the probability spreadsheet that I have attached and which works for 1 minutes movement of NOW using Index 0 and not looking back using index 1, 2, 3,4 etc.

Ok. I will design a win-win algo, keeping retirees in my mind.

How about using vertical lines (instead of horizontal lines) based on Time element and price moves based on the frequency of immediate previous bars?

When time frame was chosen, was it equal to the normal period?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
first of all look at the shape, not at the value

value on your PC must be different from my value on my PC. since your PC has less pixels,

your PC according to your picture check for the last 121 bars. look at 121 on your picture.

while my PC check and draw for the last 171 bars. (my PC screen is wider)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and of course calculation is based on only-equation for index,

for example for EURUSD = ( EURGBP*EURAUD* .......*EURJPY(Normalized) )^(1/7)

then minus 1

then multiply by 10000

I1 orange, convert pips to price, since 1.0000 is the ref price since 85 days ago for all pairs. (in my PC case)

but we both have the same wave shape.

--- 帖子 #410 ---

post #408 s not clear?

you can change frame to see the frame on the corner will change accordingly. (passive element)

regarding D1 is linked to H1, please understand our definition of the DAY.

our definition of the day: DAY is the last 24 hours, not the last Thursday

for example now is 18:00, then day on F1 is the candle drawn from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 now.

I think 4 forex pairs is good enough for price profile. The intention is to make maximum use of margin to generate more trades continously.

The one with a low volatility range will be fit candidates like CHF, gold, Euro.

You can use your scanner or use my Spreadsheet to generate statistics on finding the low volatility symbols.

For 5 years I have traded using an EA which took a set amount of bars (threshold defined by me) and checks whether or not the difference between the highest or lowest points is bigger than the pip threshold (defined by me). Logically, if the high point was further back in time than the low point, then it was considered a negative candle. I used to make a count of negative and positive bars, assigning each currency in the pair same index value 1+ or 1- .

It worked well but Indices, because of its high ADR volatility of 2% attracted me and I gave up forex trading in favour of equity indices.

Price profile works very well when hippo-like price jumps (may look like not tradable to a naked eye) happen in a narrow range of 30 pips.

My profit target is always not less than 10 pips so that I can always cover 2 pips trading cost. Spread don't matter for limit orders. Any discounted regulated futures broker (not cfd) will charge a brokerage fee of not more than 1 pip so total cost of trading is 2 pips.

CFD brokers using futures as a derivative charge spreads to cover their commission because they are not exchange brokers. They are just using the price feed of the exchange and some of them even don't charge swaps fee. Futures have no swap cost so in order to mislead the retailers they claim they are future brokers.

Some of them are genuinely using exchange price feed for their indices CFD and if a retailer can accept their high commission rates of 6 pips (return) and do position trades, then those traders will be at a better position than those who don't use the futures price feed for CFD and make up to 20 pips commission by inflating them during the trading breaks as well as during the actual trading.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Equity indices I can suggest is DAX40, S&P500 from my own experience.

Price profile works well only if the price crosses a TP by at least 5 points to 9 points in a grid distance of 10 pips.

Example: For a 40 pips range of 10 pips distance of increment for a pullback and with a TP of 8 pips profit, if the price profile is activated then trading will keep continuing. If the price profile is not used, then there will be one trade only for each pending order. The major risk for the price profile is that the price should not revisit (price crossing) for less than trading costs of 2 pips. It will be be profitable if revisits result in dips of (for Buy Limit) 4,5,6,7,8 or 9 pips when the increment distance is 10 pips..

Attached is the picture of my strategy and screenshots of trades I have done for DAX40 micro FDS @Euro 1 for yesterday.

1. I have found the consolidation patterns are systematically implemented by official market makers and can be very usefully traded stress free with the help of bot executing  trades.

Don't need a signal . Only find the link between the big economic events and consolidation patterns regularity and find the frequency of smallest tradable size based on pips.

Also on days like Fridays and Mondays  the same pattern is used to wind and unwind the markets .

Stress-free non-directional small range trading during regular consolidation zones by finding them based on price profile will help the risk averse traders.

2. In my excel sheet volume ticks are counted Candle wise, minute wise but not analysed in any manner except making it a total to compare with total of OH OL ticks.

it does not require modifying the mt4 indicator that generates the spreadsheet. Just need to have more columns added to the spreadsheet and and linked with the existing indicator.

Will you please do it?

Thank you.

I am waiting for the day you use indexes by using genuine futures price feeds provided by two brokers, GBE Brokers and Easymarkets.

Their spreads are different because they include their own spreads of commissions. Both are charge similar commissions but they are faithfully using futures price data for their index futures with a different symbols having suffix to differentiate from other CFDs based on same symbols.

Dear Al-Otaibi,

what is the difference between THREE_PAIR_1 and THREE_PAIR_2 ?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Swiss quote and exness have no futures price feeds.

Interactive Brokers does not offer MT4 trading platform.

We need futures price feed demo trading platform and not CFD price feeds supplied by market makers with wild spreads.

Futures CFD brokers don't charge wild spreads.

Besides we are demo trading for experimental trading .

Until the platform becomes stable, you can't use it for live trading.

For BTCKRW:

DIGOS=1*1000=1000

DIGO=1000*1=1000

For NAS100:

DIGOS=100*1=100

DIGO=100*0.01=1

--- 帖子 #535 ---
anyway, I find another critical problem CADZAR is divisive pair not multiplicative

D-I, not D-D nor M-D

CADZAR = USDZAR/USDCAD

Why it Is "I" = Inverse

reason: CADZAR base is CAD, but it is in the denominator of USDZAR/USDCAD

NEWPAIR draws everything as they are multiplicative---that is very critical mistake.

you will get correct chart draw for GBPZAR, but wrong for CADZAR ---- GBPZAR is originally a multiplicative pair M-D

currently you will get the chart of a pair named USD^2/(CAD)/(ZAR) -- COMPOUND PAIR, no-sense pair!!

and the reason for that to make prices appealing to our sense

and then if we sense, we can compare.

USDSEK price: 10.12345
EURUSD price: 01.09345

R=2 for the first, r=1 for the second:

USDSEK price: 1.012345
EURUSD price: 1.09345
both now around 1, you can feel it, sense it, compare it.

others see USDSEK price at 10.12345, but you see it as 1.01234

your post about trading itself, which is a subjective matter.

sometimes counter or against counter fails and some times succeed. it is a 50% 50% probability.

each case has its proper trading time.

MAHAL role is just to save your time, for example S/R point will be listed on spatial domain for all pairs in less than 1 second.

FM ORANGE will be about the maximum possible lots what make MCP=0 PIPS.

Its math rule is very simple, its is sol/r ?? to check.

let us prove it.

...

..

--- 帖子 #635 ---
MCP=0;

Extra risk:

Always max possible leverage at extra high risk is ORIGINAL_LEVERAGE/SOL_VALUE
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

in other words, if your balance is 10,000 and SOL of your broker is 30%,

then you can trade as if your balance is 33,333.33 ---------------> (10,000/0.30) ----> leverage is tripled (since 1/0.30 = 3.333333333)

Greetings Mohammad,

I am relatively new to trading and all, joined FF just last march. Been silently reading this thread and the millionaire EA (still have 400 pages to read through with that).

I do not think my thousand dollars with millionaire would survive. Planning to manually trade using mahal; what are your thoughts on divergences? mainly reversals and continuation. EDIT: The renkonized zigzag would be a nice reference for spoting divs.

Your teachings have been profound, Thank you.

just a fun trivia Mahal is "Love" in my language

On USDJPY daily chart, sequence of event are as follows;

1. Signal Line cross Main Line Downwards

2. Signal Line cross Zero Line Upwards

3. Signal Line cross Main Line Upwards

4. Signal Line cross Main Line Downwards

5. Signal Line cross Main Line Upwards

6. Signal Line cross Main Line Downwards

After Signal Line Crossed Zero Line - There are 4 events (Event Sr No. 3 & 5 - Upwards, 4 & 6 - Downwards)

So how the value 3 comes ?

--- 帖子 #671 ---
of course, new trend counter

if main or signal cross zero--counter reset

thank you for clear picture

case 3:

3. Signal Line cross Main Line Downwards, on condition that they are above zero (+ve MACD Area)

we call it direct cross--- or normal cross

in your picture case 1, 4, and 6 is not direct, it is called opposite cross, that we count for overbought/oversold degree

how to test using paper-pencil

:record a sample now of both PRICE and MARGIN LEVEL

after some seconds, record/take another sample,

then do calculations to get rate of change (let us call it sensitivity)

usually true definition of sensitivity is a little bit different,

it is scientifily a (rate of change of any amount) divided by the (rate of change of another amount with different unit)

rate divided by another rate---refer to physics courses

--- 帖子 #846 ---
New lesson: why i put CLASSIC as the first indicator in our list?

answer: because it is the most comprehensive tool in our expert,

look how easy to know how far the RESISTANCE from the current price, AUDUSD, before 79 candles, there is an absolute high(resistance)

since it is in the left side , it is broken (price above assumed resistance)
ordinary people say: broken resistance becomes a support, but we do not say that. we say it is a "broken resistance"

then it is a retest point. of course we highly recommend buylimit at 0.73136

Hello Mohammed, nice trade entries btw

Just saw the profile shout. Since mahal already does a phenomenal work visualizing all the incorporated technical analyzers (and then some), having the capability to send or create alerts whenever "specific" parameters are hit (e.g. broken support/resistance) would be really nice. Still hoping you'd add divergences with mahal

EDIT: Other than the divergences with the Renkonized Zigzag (really like that feature), another suggestion would be drawing ray lines connecting points on the zigzag to identify trend reversals, pretty sure the channel only follows the current trend or range. welp, that was stupid of me, sorry

I_fm = (1-S)*(CS/R)*ZZZXXX

for double leverage:
I_fm = (1-2S)*(CS/R)*ZZZXXX

for triple leverage
I_fm = (1-3S)*(CS/R)*ZZZXXX

ZZZXXX is the pair price itself

CS: Contract size

R: Leverage

S: StopOutLevel (Minimum Margin Level)

Assume you want to trade Nasdcac with R=50:1 and current price is 14,000

CS=1 unit

for full margin entry, MCP will be:
I_fm = (1-S)*(CS/R)*ZZZXXX = (0.70)*(1/50)*14000 = 0.70*280=196 pips

for doubling leverage MCP will be:
I_fm = (1-2S)*(CS/R)*ZZZXXX = (0.40)*(1/50)*14000 = 0.40*280=112 pips

for tripling leverage MCP will be:

MCP

BARS SHOWS 10000/MCP,   not MCP
why?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

who could imagine answer?

assume MCP for EURUSD is 100,000, very save, but will show long bar with 100,000 pips, them risky pairs bar, will be very small,

we must care for pairs with low MCP, not high MCP

Therefore the best thing to do is to inverse MCP, make it in denominator

then multiply by 10000 to make y-axis values estimable

--- 帖子 #904 ---
above is direct MCP pair, before inversion rule

after inversion:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

high bars become low bars, and low bars become high bars

math:

100 is big number,

when you divide 1 by 100, it becomes very small number

we need to annihilate (make smaller) the save MCP which is literally very very large!

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Now picture shows that, CADJPY is the most risky pair (higher pipValue)

so stop adding to this pair

--- 帖子 #906 ---
so you have to "drink" a new complex culture, a "new theory" in the risk management field studies

complicated mind is a virtue and it is a step (if not a great jump) toward success

while simple minds will continue forever as simple minds, and one can not describe it in any other way.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
if we see y-axis max value , let say 1000, then MCP definitely is 10---very very very risky

Why 1000?

rule: 10000/MCP = 10000/10=1000

now what is separate line b/w risky and non-risky
here it depends on your phycological number!

you how tolerate, you who decide!! ?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
let us rename MCP inversion based on our rule as MCPI

we add letter I

then

MCP = 10,000/MCPI

therefore:

MCPI = 10,000/MCP

MCPI*MCP=10,000

The Math Behind Fibonacci

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Can we do it in reverse or proactive? Let's first determine the number of pips after which the margin call occurs, and accordingly, we will know the size of the lot for each pair or for each currency.
For example, the EUR/USD pair, I select the number 200, and the lot size that Margin Call occurs after 200 Pips appears.

ممكن نعملها معكوسة أو استباقية دعنا أولا نحدد عدد النقاط التي يحدث بعدها المارجن وبناءأ عليه نعرف حجم اللوت لكل زوج أو لكل عملة
مثلا زوج اليور/دولار أحدد رقم 200 فيظهر حجم اللوت الذي يحدث عنده المارجن كول بعد 200 نقطة

we may add Schmitt trigger to y-axis scaling, to prevent a lot of hysteresis!

assume y-axis max now is 140, and bar length itself is fluctuating /w 139 and 142!

if above 140 scale max will be 160?

then when back below 140, becomes 140 and so on---the max may change within 1 minute 1000 times!! we want to prevent this. less noise, less hysteresis!! and more comfortable!

boiler in your bathroom when set at 132 Fahrenheit, they use this concept, to prevent ON/OFF of power many times in seconds!

when 132 was hit, then power is off tell temperature drop to 111F for example, then ON---till Temp reaches 132 again (save a lot of mechanical(latches) and power losses)

for stock APL, make file APLxxx.wav

there is a CRES and CSUP methods! and still under final improvement

else it is a CSUP.

السلام عليكم اخى العتيبى

اولا احب اهنيك واهنئ كل اصدقائى هنا بالعيد تقبل الله منا ومنكم صالح الاعمال ان شاء الله واعاده الله علينا بالخير والبركات

ثانيا اخى اريد ان اقتراح اضافه شئ بخصوص الفيبوناتشى ويكون منفضل يعنى بمعنى نثبت لون معين لهذه الفكرة

وهى الوحده الزمنية الثابته

وهى رسم فيبوناتشى على وحده اغلقت بالفعل وكل تايم فريم له وحده زمنية ثابته على سبيل المثال فريم الدقيقه يكون فيبوناتشى على اخر ساعه اغلقت ويستمر الى ان تغلق الساعه الحاليه ثم يتغير

فريم ال5 دقايق يكون على اخر شمعة 4 ساعات اغلقت ويتغير حين تغلق ال4 ساعات الحاليه

الربع ساعه يكون اخر 6 ساعات اغلق وده بيكون المرجع ليها عند الافتتاح يكون الفيبو مرسوم على اخر 6 ساعات وننتظر اغلاق الشمعة السادسه للتغير وهكذا

فريم النص ساعه يكون 12 ساعه

فريم الساعه يكون على اليوم الاخير

بمعنى شمعة الامس وعند اغلاق شمعة اليوم يتغير الرسم

فريم الاربع ساعات يكون اخر اسبوع

فريم اليومى يكون اخر شهر اغلق

فريم الاسبوعى يكون اخر 6 شهور اغلقت

فريم الشهرى يكون السنه التى اغلقت

Dear Al-Otaibi,

It has been a long time since my last post in this thread.

How are you? i wish all the best for you.

According to the "FM", DIGOS = 100 (r=2) for USDKRW
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

but according to SMART_GRID Expert, DIGOS = 10,000 (r=4)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

That's what makes me confused. which is the correct one?

Moreover, when i myself do the calculation, it comes out with a different result:
USDKRW price now is: 1274.5217

normalize to EURUSD (value b/w 0.50 and 5)
==> 1.2745217
==> DIGOS = 1,000 (r=3)

In conclusion, which is the correct one?

DIGOS = 100 (r=2) ?

DIGOS = 1,000 (r=3) ?

DIGOS = 10,000 (r=4) ?

very stupid assumption if your broker is very stupid ... some brokers have 6 candles per week !!! (candle of Sunday is only 3 hours !! ) like exness

what is the solution ..

programmatically:

take the time itself then calculate for candles # .. .

for example today is 25.05.2023 /////then month start is 25.04.2023 ....then calc for  candles number (get number of daily candles)

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
according to month=22 days ---> with exness from 1 may to 25 may (this day) is a complete month ... their candles = 22 candles!!

in Realtime ... this is very stupid concept!

we need to start from 25.04.2023... not 01.05.2023

candle#24 ??

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
yes

since time (vertical line is the same hour for today and yesterday)

so our day is actually prev 24 candles plus today candle . .

keep it as it is or decrement 1 ??

we will keep it as it is

so any candles number for day is 24.x candle

ans: I guess YES ... even if the resulting frame is "unnamed"

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
then this is weird ?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
let us check . .

AA=3

CA=0;

[i]open=iOpen(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,CA+30);

high=iHigh(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iHighest(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,MODE_HIGH,AA+30,CA));

low=iLow(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iLowest(pairs,PERIOD_M1,MODE_LOW,AA+30,CA));

=

[i] open=iOpen(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,30);

high=iHigh(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iHighest(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,MODE_HIGH,33,0));

low=iLow(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iLowest(pairs,PERIOD_M1,MODE_LOW,33,0));
-------------

sorry, will be fine only for AA=1 . . . to be improved . .
high and low will include also candles #31, #32,

while open at C#30 !!!

so just we must add AA-1 to open ... this is the solution

[i]open=iOpen(pairs,PERIOD_M1,CA+30+A-1);

Now check again: AA=3, A=0;

[i]open=iOpen(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,0+30+3-1); = 32

high=iHigh(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iHighest(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,MODE_HIGH,33,0));

low=iLow(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iLowest(pairs,PERIOD_M1,MODE_LOW,33,0));
33=32 CANDLES + candle#0 = 33

--- 帖子 #1267 ---
please brother phu

check for CA=3 AA=4?

will all 4 paramterws will be in conformity (span from start candle to last candle)

take corrected open function:
open=iOpen(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,CA+x+A-1);

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
close=iClose(pairs[i],0,CA);
open=iOpen(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,CA+x+A-1);
high=iHigh(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iHighest(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,MODE_HIGH,AA+x,CA));
low=iLow(pairs[i],PERIOD_M1,iLowest(pairs,PERIOD_M1,MODE_LOW,AA+x,CA));

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
generic check . .

close at : CA

OPEN at: CA+x+A-1

therefore, number of spanned candles is: (OPEN)-(CLOSE)+1 = (CA+x+A-1)-(CA)+1=x+A

then high and low total candles is x+A
no need to check . . .

EXTREME definition:

for example GBPAUD is a "division pair"

since GBPAUD=GBPUSD/AUDUSD . . . . . . .divided by

therefore . .

if GBPUSD goes up and AUDUSD goes down we expect a double push for GBPAUD (two forces leading to the same direction)

do you see this very stupid "0" ?? current chart Which is H4

when you go to chart M15 ?? things must be shifted by the total period of H4 which is 240 minutes
start candle itself most be fitted correctly to be delayed from current price by 240 minutes . . assuming last 240 min are the current candle .. common sense rule

Then you go to M15 picture at 05:45:01 candle of 05:45:00

No to make MA-CURVE orange at rank#1 instead of F1 (MY OPINION)

we add prev MA extreme points for the last 2000 candles . . (up to 6 extremes downside or upside)

some of them will be filtered . . (small values diff are useless !! )

Orange Concept (please write my post before I die )

if RSI cross first 70 up, then the cross price , let say: 1.1234

days later RSI crosses 70 up .... at price 1.1334 .. second up cross

if second cross price is higher , , ,then, , , ,  color=BLUE (There was a strong trend)

the issue causes by the period of the weekend when the market is closed for that pair.

So i have a suggestion:

for perd=="PERIOD_MN1" and perd=="PERIOD_W1", the code is ok, in other word, leave it as it is

but for the lower periods: please replace barStart and barEnd as the below code
Inserted Code                   else if(perd=="PERIOD_D1")
{
barStart=  CA*24;
barEnd=    (CA+AA)*24;
...
...
}
else if(perd=="PERIOD_H4")
{
barStart=  CA*16;
barEnd=    (CA+AA)*16;
...
...
}
else if(perd=="PERIOD_H1")
{
barStart=  CA*12;
barEnd=    (CA+AA)*12;
...
...
}
else if(perd=="PERIOD_M30")
{
barStart=  CA*30;
barEnd=    (CA+AA)*30;
...
...
}
else if(perd=="PERIOD_M15")
{
barStart=  CA*15;
barEnd=    (CA+AA)*15;
...
...
}
else if(perd=="PERIOD_M5")
{
barStart=  CA*5;
barEnd=    (CA+AA)*5;

working on RSI-BLUE

the same values, but the concept is

1) DEtermine Trend(example cross 70 up)

2) Decide Enry on correftion (cross 40 below or up after 70 cross, on condition that it doens touch 30)

and vice versa for 30-LEEL
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

No more, no less, and please no suggestions here .. take it or leave it

you only have the right to set trend determination level(70/30 on picture) and entry level (40/60, not 60/40 on picture)

existing ver is complete months ago .. just to check parameters buttons

do you want to draw trend for example without remoing dashboard??

click on dot (any TECH POINT)

IF IT IS NOT THE PAIR CHART  dash will be deleted
BACK (there is only one button to click)

then click on the same dot again

if you want to enforce deletion to make pure chart with pure trend each time ... make CLEAN button red . .

below: tech lines on dashboard . . .since CLEAN is not red .... and the same chart Symbol . .

SPIKE RED concept:

very simple: my definition of volatile is 35 pips (update each 10 seconds)

so if the pair moves by 35 pips mat occurs during 1 hour or 1 second .. then i will hear the appropriate music . . .

you already downloaded 200 sound *.wav files from SmartGrid thread . .

women voice for down prices

male voices for upward move . .
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

end of explanation

later if its moves by 35 pips from last alert price either up or down, you will be alerted . .

sound formats always is
male: HIGH_EURUSD.wav //// up
female: LOWX_EURUSD.wav //// down

for other pairs just change pair part name

--- 帖子 #1480 ---
is the dash format will be good for you if you switch from 28 pairs to EUR-RED (only 7 pairs)

check for these issues . . you have a 24 hours (open for suggestions)

do not miss

Dear Al-Otaibi,

what is the difference of them?

group of 8 buttons vs "EXTREME" button
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
any choice will be the calibration currency for EXTREME CASES

so now calibration may be based on any currency, not only DOMINATING currency, which is usually USD

assume JPY Button, and focus on pair GBPAUD

so instead of equation: GBPAUD=GBPUSD/AUDUSD

the used equation is GBPAUD=GBPJPY/AUDJPY

in one word DDD value is JPY

is i now very clear ...

now since it is a division pair based on JPY=DDD

then extreme cases are 1) +- case or 2) -+case opposite movements of both two main JPYs pairs (namely: GBPJPY, AUDJPY)

+-: GBPJPY UP while AUDJPY down

why extreme?

reason value of numerator becomes higher while values of denominator gets lowers: double push in one direction

assume you have 112/109

what will happen to the value in this case (112+1)/(109-1) = 113/108 ?? will be higher or lower??

is it clear?

--- 帖子 #1489 ---
our minds can not visualize more than 9 cases

can you imagine the tenth??

--- 帖子 #1490 ---
possible cases or max random outcomes:

1) 0 0   case (both pair: no movement.. like vacations now)

2) 0 +  case (some what idle)

3) + 0   case (some what idle)

4) 0 - case (some what idle)

5) - 0   case (some what idle)

6) ++   case (idle for division pair, while extreme/volatile for multiplication pairs)

7)- - case (idle for division pair, while extreme/volatile for multiplication pairs)

8) + - case (idle for multiplication  pair, while extreme/volatile for division pairs)

9) - + case (idle for multiplication pair, while extreme/volatile for division pairs)

. . .

.

this post for market philosophers (not for normal traders)

.

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
assuming JPY prices for pair named YYYJPY (numerator) and another pair named XXXJPY (denominator)

assume 113/108

==>

114/109 ?? or 112/107

no huge difference compared to 114/107

always forex market first rule is:
YYYXXX  =  YYYDDD/XXXDDD  =  YYYJPY/XXXJPY  =  YYYJPY*JPYXXX

why GBPEUR ?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1507 ---
please do not ask like this

what is shown is for GBPEUR, not EURGBP

so if EURGBP is red, you will see green (opposite)

since GBP is our DDD now
left: terminal currency
right: converted currency, if needed, (what we want)

and buttons red/green for right buttons

--- 帖子 #1508 ---
why?

ans: to easily compare non-DDD currencies

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
look at Background color for our so-called dominating or calibration currency . . .

so it will be converted if necessary to make all math pairs as if they are all DIV pairs .... REASON: for easiness

SPIKE-RED will reference

SPike-Blue will not reference (like our SmartGrid expert, since there is no reference after start)

assume pips = 30

for BLUE, each new 30 pips up, alert

while for RED: if up 30 pips ALERT, then if drop 30 ALERT, then if up 30 ALERT and so on ...

i wonder how can we say about volatile if there is a pair, for example, that moves by 35 pips in 24 hours or even 2 days or more

in other words, we get an alert which notices us that:

there is a pair moves by 35 pips from the last alert price which was 1 or 2 days or even 1 month ago

and we say there is volatile in that pair???

please correct me if i misunderstand of how SPIKE-RED works.

--- 帖子 #1604 ---
yes, trader has the right to define volatility range and period , ,

but here we care for SPIKES . . . . that mean happened at short period . .

I didnt mean nothing bad into your address mate, only had in mind for me, I felt stupid, didnt want to insult or say something bad

--- 帖子 #1641 ---
i know that . .

nothing bad in you post ... actually opposite is true ..

but just to clarify again for others, it is not more than a comprehensive tool for market analysis . . just tp save a lot of our analysis time . .

.

for example for button S/R . . . since it arranges supports resistance according to the nearest on the chart .. it shows the nearest 10 supportss/ resistances ..

by the way, there are some videos here, and in future more videos will be uploaded . .

do you check "MOVIE" ??

AO-PINK: Lesson-1:

on AO indic chart: 2 yellow horizontal lines are filter lines

so any trough below will be filtered . . (for AO-neg .. any value above is filtered)

or

let us say, any trough(AO top/button) b/w THE two h-lines will be filtered either neg. or pos.

--- 帖子 #1675 ---
AO-PINK: Lesson-2:

first 8 top/bottoms above upper HL or below lower HL , will be dotted using BLUE color (important troughs)

any trough(collective name for both top and button) b/w two lines will take color red or lime (unimportant troughs)

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
AO-PINK: Lesson-3:

if the AO value now is breaking all 8 important troughs, then dash square will be white(+ve AO) or yellow(-ve AO) . .

ver 71 in the main post

AO-PINK: Lesson-4:

But if the AO value now is breaking 7 important troughs, then the dash square will be aqua (+ve AO) or violet(-ve AO) . .

AO-PINK: Lesson-5:

and if the AO value now is breaking 6 important troughs, then the dash square will be blue(+ve AO) or orange(-ve AO) . .

and so on as the colors has been arranged on the top of indic dashboard

working on FIBOS . . . for EXTREME purposes . .

How to get FIBO price at specific level;, let us say 61.8% (0.618 as a value)

FIBO_LEVEL_PRICE=(HIGH-LOW)*FL%+ref;

ref: is 0.0% level which could be HIGH or LOW . .

PLEASE phu, zreboo confirm correctness of this rule, using excel or pen-paper . .

--- 帖子 #1735 ---
please use this picture data . .
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1736 ---
FIBO_LEVEL_PRICE=(HIGH-LOW)*FL%+ref;

HIGH /// at this time is 100% fibo = 1.24469

LOW/// at this time is 0% fibo = 1.18016

problem is: "is REF must be HIGH or LOW"

let us assume ref=LOW:
FIBO_LEVEL_PRICE=(HIGH-LOW)*FL%+LOW;

if FL%=100% --->

FIBO_LEVEL_PRICE = HIGH-LOW+LOW = HIGH
very excellent . .

to check for fibo 61.8%

FIBO_LEVEL_PRICE=(HIGH-LOW)*0.681+LOW;
= (1.24469-1.18016)*0.618+1.18016 = 1.22004 ---> THE SAME ON THE PCITURE . . .

--- 帖子 #1737 ---
correction:
FIBO_LEVEL_PRICE=(FB 100.0% - FB 0.0% ) * FL% + FB 0.0%
