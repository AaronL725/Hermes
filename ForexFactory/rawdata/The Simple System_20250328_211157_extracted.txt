I thought it best to start a new thread to discuss this simple method. Am not one for a lot of typing so here goes. 1) This system is based on "T3MA" triple smoothed MA indicator. 2) I do not use the default parameters of 15 and 0.7, Instead I use 4 and 1.5(volume factor). 3) When plotted on a chart, T3MA will have well defined peaks and valleys. 4) I have coded a very simple indicator to detect those peaks and valleys which appear as arrows up or down. 5) A built-in alarm alerts you when a new arrow forms. That's where it gets complicated. BUY on the formation of an UP arrow and SELL on a down arrow; that's it! So far it seems to be OK on any TF but, of course, the longer TF's are better because of less random "noise". TF's M30 to H4, seem to be the best. Have fun. Pip2 P.S. As usual, make sure T3MA.mq4 is in your "INDICATORS" folder (you MUST compile it too). If you have problems, click on "Terminal" on the platform, then choose "Journal" tab on the right, you will see what's going on, and hopefully fix it.

Hi Snobol1, I would like to be the first one to thank you for sharing...love those people here that is out to help and help. Keep up the good work everyone....believe in what good goes around will come around. Regards Robert

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thanks Robert. Pip2

--- 帖子 #4 ---
On what pairs do you think it works best? Does the T3MA work better in trend or range? Does it lag like most MAs? Thanks for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Good questions KudzuFX, I'll try to answer: 1) It works in both but trends are infinitely more profitable. 2) Yes it lags by one bar or less, it does not lag as much as "Perky" a similar indicator. 3) It works on most pairs, be careful of GBPUSD, because of its volatility, use H4 for GBPUSD. I'll work on taming the alert because it can be annoying when hit. Each time there is a new tick the alert goes off if conditions are right. Try playing with the volume factor in T3MA and see if you can reduce the little lag there is. Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Dear Snobol1, Thank you for being share your simple system with me. I am looking forward to trade this system on the demo. Warmest regards, jkdguy

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Snobol1 I want to ask how is your indicator T3MA-Alarm working. Because I put it on a daily chart and it looks quite good. Does it redraw past or not? Thank you for answer. Peter

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Test for yourself on m1 chart, I'll test it tomorrow evening...

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I really like this indicator. I've been looking at the D1 charts. Almost perfect. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I cannot seem to get it to work on Metatrader. It loads and then is removed from the chart, that is what is says under the journal tab. Any help out there?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thats what worry me - is almost perfect. and nothing is perfect in fx

Repaint... To bad

--- 帖子 #13 ---
How long have you been using this indicator? They say it repaints.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
No it does not repaint, but in order to get the first chance at an entry I have made it show an arrow while BAR #0 is still being formed. If I wait until bar 0 is fully formed bar 0 is now bar 1 and the signal will be 1 bar later. If an arrow appears while bar 0 is being formed, that arrow might disappear if the bar shrinks in the opposite direction. The best time to use the signal arrow is right AFTER bar 0 closes and becomes bar 1 and the new bar 0 opens. If an arrow forms and the bar which initiated it (Bar 0) is closed, that arrow WILL NOT be repainted!. I know, because I wrote this simple indicator. Common sense in trading still holds true. Don't sell in an up trend, and don't buy in a downtrend. Always buy or sell on pullbacks in the direction of the trend. I use T3MA(28,0.7) to determine the trend on H4 charts. I have been paper and demo trading this week only but the results are encouraging. This indicator has less lag than MA crosses and MACD. In a ranging market, caution is the rule as always. Hope this helps. Pip2

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Peter, no it does not repaint, I used the triple smoothed MA called T3MA with a period of 4 and a volume factor of 1.5 instead of 0.7. This reduces the lag quite a bit. I am working on a way to tame the Alarm. Pip2

--- 帖子 #16 ---
First , you must put the indicator in the INDICATORS folder, which is in the EXPERTS folder. Then RESTART Metatrader platform from its shortcut. In the NAVIGATOR panel on the left, scroll down until you find the indicator. RIGHT click on it and in the window that opens choose MODIFY. When the file is open choose FILE from LEFT TOP menu scroll down to COMPILE. If it compiles OK you're in business. Go back to the NAVIGATOR panel on the left, and attach it to your chart. If you have errors on compiling, send me a PM. Pip2

--- 帖子 #17 ---
What TF do you trade this on? It seems to be best on 4hr(GBP/USD). If you had a buy signal on 4hr tf would you add to positions using the signal on lower tfs that agreed with the 4 hr signal?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Yes, I use it on the 4 hour TF but I do not check lower TF's before or after placing an order. I have not fully assessed the wisdom in using lower, or other TF's to make position decisions. In the spirit of keeping it simple, I just stick to the H4 TF and with a T3MA(28,0.7) indicator on the chart, I know what the TREND is. So I don't buck the trend, I go with the flow. I also don't trade a pair if its trend at that point is not clear. This indicator like other indicators, supplements common sense, not supersede common sense. Pip2

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Snobol, thank you for sharing your expertise... I've already put your system to use, and will be using it to see how it performs. I'll let you know the results, and if they're anything like the history shows, it should be fantastic!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Results are always welcome, hope you make lots of dough! Pip2

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thank you for your answer. I was playing with idea to put it on a daily chart. I want to backtest it these days. I was thinking that next day after arrow is showed take a trade at certain time and let it go till another arrow is given or SL hit. Is it right to do it like this? Will it be also like this in real? Thank you

--- 帖子 #22 ---
If the past is any indicator for daily charts, then it seems it will work well in the future for daily charts. I just went short on USDJPY, at 118.83, on the down arrow from yesterday or two days ago. We'll see how this first trade goes. I'm already in the green--I've got a 100 pip SL, but I'm not setting a TP. I'm just going to let it ride and cover when the indicator signals, or when I feel the run has finished. The beauty of daily charts is that they don't eat all your time, which is something important to me I'm realizing these days :-)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Yes you right. Thats the reason why I stick on daily charts. Hope you harvest a lot of pips. Peter

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I've looked at your system and it seems to be an effective trader. Will keep you informed after using it for a while.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I have tried the different settings that you have mentioned in this thread...but I notice that no matter which setting I have used the arrows are still in the same location with the alarm indicator.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
This indicator looks very promising. Thanks for sharing with us here Wish you many pips!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks Snobol1 for this great indicator. After looking at it, I agree with a couple of others that it could be used on the D1 charts and only tend to it once a day. I am also considering using a 100 pip SL with no TP. Looks like it works with any currency. Looks like a winner. Carol

t3ma.mq4 is NOT repainting, BUT t4ma-alarm.mp4 DOES!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I tested the alarm (arrows) when this was first posted. I watched it repaint the arrows on 5M. Be sure to double check what you are using.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hello. What is a good setting for daily chart please? Thank in advance. Cha.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Could you attach the picture when I should entry please? Thank. Cha.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Reread the first post.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
hy, t3ma is not working properly, it fails to display any information after 10 or 15 bars, anyone can test it on 1m tf and see the problem.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Well I had it on a 5 min chart switched time frames, came back to the 5 min and an arrow appeared 3 bars back from the current bar that was not there. I also seen an arrow on a previous bar (not current) on a 1 hr chart and it disappeared. So I have little faith in this indicator. Which is too bad as it had a lot of promise.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
OK guys, each time the indicator is refreshed either by changing TF's or by a new tick on a chart, or by clicking "edit" from the Indicators menu, a completely new set of arrows will be calculated this is NOT repainting. Why? On refresh if the data presented are different you will (must) get new arrow positions because the data have changed. The most important arrow is the last arrow which is based on bar 0: bar 0 is normally in a state of flux. Up and down. The last arrow might disappear and return depending on the state of bar0; the first bar. It is best to wait until bar 0 becomes bar1, i.e. at the close of bar 0 and the open of a new bar0, to place a trade if the trend is favourable. I checked this indicator with another called "perky" and it is several bars earlier than "perky". I have not tested on D1 TF, on the lower TF's there will be too much noise. This is NOT a scalping indicator, so please don't use ridiculously low TF's then complain it does not work. All indicators have preferred TF's. This one works best from H1 to H4, although D1 may also work OK. To recap, TF's H1,H4 and maybe D1, use a trend indicator, also Stochastic(10,4,4) helps as a confirming indicator. I've closed all my positions to-day Friday at 9.44k up from about $6.2k on Sunday, using this method (demo acct). Pip2 See attached screen-shot

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I have T3MA and T3MA alarm attached to my chart...I have changed the values of T3MA several times but the arrows on the chart stay in the same positions anyway. Is the T3MA indicator supposed to show the arrows also? What would be the signals if we used T3MA without the alarm and arrows? Thanks, I really think this is a good indicator I just want to clear up a few things before testing.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hi, thanks for sharing, and it looks very simple. less time sticking to the screen. im sorry if this question is stupid.. i dont quite understarnd regarding bar 1 and bar 0 that u mentioned in your earlier post. what is it bar 1 and bar 0 in the chart means? can u give more example on this? i mean can u give some examples about bar 1 and bar 0 whenever we look to place a trade in 'visuals/pictures explanation'? maybe i can get better understanding using pictures. thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
T3ma and T3MA-ALARM are two separate stand alone programs. First T3MA-ALARM. The position of the arrows is coded in T3MA-ALARM, they will not move by changing the T3MA indicator. I will post another version which allows you to do that. Right now T3MA-ALARM is coded at period 4 and volume factor 1.5. If you set T3MA inficator to those parameters, you will see the positioning of the arrows correspond to the peaks and valleys of T3MA. T3MA is a triple smoothed MA and removes much noise even on lower TF's. The alarm part is just a convenience so you don't have to stare at your computer all day, when a trade is imminent , it will let you know, that is, if you are at home and not out cavorting with your wife or significant other. lol. Pip2

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks! I am looking to use this on 4hr TF.(alarm indicator). I am also working on confirming indicators for this

--- 帖子 #40 ---
A good confirming indicator on the longer TF's is "HAS" Heiken Ashi Smoothed. There is a thread on this Forum about this indicator so I'll say no more. Pip2

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi. sonobol1 This is my screen shot with setting 28 and 0.7 but look different from you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Look at post #38 . T3MA used for the Alarm indicator is set at 4 and 1.5. NOT 28 and .7. Read post #38 again. Pip2

--- 帖子 #43 ---
This my chart when I change T3MA to 4 and 1.5 Thank for your help. Cha. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Nice indicator you've came up there, buddy! My only hope is that it doesn't repaint itself, because I've already seen these so-called holy grails that repaint themselves to look better. I'm going to check it, thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Were you successful at fixing the alarm feature whereas it will go off just once instead of continuously?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
im using 4 and 1.5 setup... Snobol1, does it look correct? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #47 ---
But only a bit. By judging this code: PHP Code if( xdown == 1 ){ dnbuffer [ cnt + 1 ]= High [ cnt + 1 ]+( sep * Point );} if( xup == 1 ){ upbuffer [ cnt + 1 ]= Low [ cnt + 1 ]-( sep * Point );} You actually see that the buffer is not changed for the current bar(cnt), but for the bar before the current(cnt+1), so the signal is actually changed a bit. Anyway, I still think it is a system worth checking.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I didn't really understand how you used the iCustom function.. You've written this code: PHP Code ax0 [ cnt ]= iCustom ( Symbol (), 0 , "T3MA" , 4 , 1.5 , cnt ); ax1 [ cnt + 1 ]= iCustom ( Symbol (), 0 , "T3MA" , 4 , 1.5 , cnt + 1 ); ax2 [ cnt + 2 ]= iCustom ( Symbol (), 0 , "T3MA" , 4 , 1.5 , cnt + 2 ); But in iCustom function you should specify the mode(buffer index) and then the shift, and you specified only the shift and parameters. It would be nice if you shed some light about the calculation here, and the method in which you define signals. Thanks in advance, M256

--- 帖子 #49 ---
No not yet fixed. I tried checking a box which said "Cancel alarm once hit" but it did not work. I'll have to hard-code a solution, maybe after 2-5 (user input) alarms it will stop for that pair. Pip2

--- 帖子 #50 ---
A picture for this is a waste of bandwidth. Look at a chart with BARS or CANDLES, NOT a line chart. The last bar or candle on the RIGHT is BAR or candle 0 Bars are numbered RIGHT to LEFT, starting with bar (PRICE BAR) 0 then bar 1 then bar 2 then bar 3 then bar......5000 etc. If this is not clear please do some more reading. Pip2

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Snobol1 I really apreciate what you have come with here... And waiting impatiently for the markets open to check whether to see a repaint or not.... I understand that people have made you a bit nervous by insisting on it does repaint... Keep on the good stuff

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes that's correct. I decided to place the arrow at bar #1 which is more stable than bar#0. If placed at bar#0 it would flicker on and off. Don't forget that the program is executed each time there is a change in price. I decided to code this indicator when I noticed the change in T3MA's "Volume factor" param. The reduction in lag was astounding. I am NOT a programmer. I have picked up bits and pieces here and there and reading a lot. So, any programmers out there, feel free to enhance my ideas for the benefit of all. Pip2

--- 帖子 #53 ---
A big fat YES, you are absolutely right, I posted the wrong version. The buffer to be used must be coded in iCustom(..."T3MA",4,1.5, 0 ,...) as you mentioned. The version I actually use is correct I will repost with the buffer info and fix the alarm at the same time. Step by step, it gets better all the time. Thanks for your input , its much appreciated. I also hope to incorporate a trend filter using a T3MA(55,0.7 ) indicator and further filtered by the slope of that trend. Arrows are placed at peaks and valleys of the T3MA(4,1.5) indicator thats all. I have tried using +- slopes, MathAbs, and other decoders. Besides that there is no other filtering yet, this is definitely a work in progress. In the spirit of keeping it simple, I am trying to have just ONE alarm indicator attached to my chart, that's all. There are so many indicators out there that you can fill up your charts to the point of not being able to see prices, or know what to do! Hopefully, ONE indicator in which you have TOTAL confidence is the best way IMO. Its basically a matter of quantity vs quality. I vote for quality! Pip2

--- 帖子 #54 ---
im sure everybody this weekend is willing your T3 MA alarm arrows, looking back in history are correct, and dont re paint, i have read all the posts, and there are different reports on it re painting or not, i do understand its annoying you that people say its repainting, but maybe as you have seen it live and the majority of us have not could clarify the following, and maybe no one will ask again?? i hope this is simple for everbody to understand?? 1. if at the start of a 4 hour bar, lets say 7.00am gmt to 11.00am gmt, bar 0, an arrow will apppear, but will change all the time whilst the price is changing for that 4 hour bar, at the end of that 4 hour bar, which becomes bar 1, at 11.01 gmt the new candle which becomes bar 0, an up or down arrow will apear on bar 1, and will not change or move from its position. i think this is what people want you to confirm. cheers.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
hi Snobol1, thanks for the explanation. it is much appreciated. thanks again.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Ok understood. When a new bar is beginning if an up arrow forms under bar#1 and the new bar just starting continues up the up arrow will stay put. But if the new bar continues up for a while then turns down the up arrow will disappear and may return if the new bar goes up again. So the state of the arrow depends on the state of the new bar. If a trend indicator shows weakening (change in slope) , the arrows give an early warning of things to come in a digital way as opposed to an analogue way as with an MA. It is my intention to incorporate an MA trend filter with threshold. That is if the slope of the trend becomes too shallow, don't trade, and no arrows will show. Sort of a grey zone. So regarding repainting, the arrows on a chart are never repainted except the last arrow being formed which is influenced by the vagaries of price movements. So that's how it works! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #57 ---
So when looking at charts with arrows we would not assume entry at the arrow shown but at the open of the bar 2 bars after the arrow because the arrow at bar 1 doesn't stay put until the close of bar 0...So after bar 0 closes and the arrow is still shown at bar 1, then entry is taken. Just want to make sure so when visually backtesting I see when actual entry would be taken.

Hi SNOBOL, I tried to download your indicators following your instructions, but when I try to compile I get an error message that says "Could not launch the compiler". Do you know what is the problem? Thanks, Alcastro

--- 帖子 #59 ---
hello I am totally new when it comes to mq4 things. i downloaded the file and compiled it(i think i did, but not sure because the description in the tool box says 'compiling' 4 ever, about 30m passed and still compiling) anyway i attached it on the chart and i see no arrows all i see is one yellow MA and 6 black MAs. Please Help Me.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I've seen that once with another file. Just try closing and reopening the platform.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Compiling 'T3MA-ALARM.mq4'... tried again but still compiling...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
PM me with the file attached. Pip2

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Seems like the file is corrupted, I have attached a new one. Pip2

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Snobol1. thanks for work on T3MA... looks very promising. Have you set a target date to provide a new attchment that you spoke of in post #53.... Thanks for everything.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
A note to all. There are several MA's in this indicator, I have blacked out all but the first one which is Gold (yellow). However I use a Black background for my charts (less glare), so the other MA's are not visible, only the Gold one is. If you don't want to see the other MA's, change the colour of your chart background to the same colour you don't want to see! Pip2

--- 帖子 #66 ---
So to verify (as Rick did), If bar 0 is the rightmost bar, bar 1 is to the left of bar 0, and bar 2 is to the left of bar 1, then an arrow under bar 2 is never repainted, correct? However, as you said above, an arrow at bar 1 can change depending on what's going on with bar 0. Correct? So, if it's Wednesday and there's an arrow under Tuesday, that arrow can change, but if it's under Monday then it cannot. Right?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Snobol1, Thanks alot. i don't know what i've done differently, but it works now. Thank you so much for sharing your system with us.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Right, right, right, only the bar next to (RHS) the bar with the arrow below/above can influence the arrow. If the Right Hand Side bar (bar0) starts and continues in the direction of the arrow , the arrow will not change. This is typical of all indicators that use bar0. Expand a chart as large as possible, attach Bollinger bands, now look at the flicker between Bar0 and bar1, you'll see what I'm talking about. Does BB repaint? Of course not. Pip2

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Early days yet, but have the indicators running on 8 pairs for the last 8 hrs..... 1 hr and 4 hr. No signals or beginning of signals on 4 hr. On 1 hr charts - USDCAD and USDCHF both placed arrows 3 bars previous to the current bar being formed when none existed before. For sure back testing will be a waste of time. However, I think perseverence is perhaps worthwhile with this indicator and will be useful once we know how it behaves. Mungo

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Pip2, It was remiss of me not to thank you for making this available. Thank you. I am in awe of people who can come up with ideas like this and then even manage to code it. Cheers Mungo

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Belay my previous observations on forming arrows 3 bars back. I have found that it was due to a delayed refresh of the calculations by the indicator(s). I'm now having to do a refresh at the end of the hr to keep things up to date. Will reload things and see if that helps. Mungo

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Mungo...when you have finished observing these 8 currency pairs, can you return and update us on how it worked out?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Snobol, first I want to thanks for sharing the system. Attached is the snapshot of chart. From your explanation before, What I get from your above comment is, we enter position on the opening of the 2nd candles after the candle with arrow. So in the attached chart, I put "a" as a marked for candle with arrow, and "b" as a marked on the candle when we open position buy/sell based on the arrow on "a" candle. For example, on the candle "1a" the arrow appear, then we wait for the "1b" candle open and enter on "1b" candle and so on. Is this the correct way of the system? I just want to make sure as I want to backtest this method. Please have a look on the attached chart.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I have included a copy of the test screenshot you sent showing where to buy and where to sell. Using a daily chart is a good idea. This indicator will give false alarms on the smaller TF's so forget about 1 min and 5 min even 15 min is too short. Besides the number of pips you make is so small its not worth it. That's a general comment. On a daily chart, prices move in the direction of the arrow more often than not. When an arrow appears it is at the close of bar 0 so now bar0 is bar1. The open of the next bar is a NEW bar0 , if arrow is up that's the time to go long only if the TREND is UP. To know if the trend is up use a separate indicator like T3MA(28,0.7). That is a T3MA line set at period 28 and volume factor 0.7. I use a black background chart so the other MA's that make up T3MA are not seen because I already set their colour to Black. The only line you need is the first one, colour it Gold or any other colour but black. So the T3MA shows uptrend? And an arrow shows up pull the trigger! The same works for short positions. If the trend is up and an arrow appears but on open of new bar0 it goes down, the arrow will disappear but return IF the price goes back up past the open. I hope this explains how this works. Its a bit tricky at the start, but it gets you in as soon as is humanly possible. Don't forget, no system is perfect, this one, I hope, comes close. Happy and profitable trading. Pip2 PS I am having trouble getting into this Forum. If your question is not resolved in 24 hrs drop me a PM. Pip2

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Iwas just looking at the screenshot above and my instructions are not clear. Buy or sell at the OPEN of the bar NEXT to the bar with an arrow. Or as close to the open as possible. Sorry my added text did not line up with those points. Pip2

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Has the alarm problem been fixed yet?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Snobol1, one more question can i ditch T3MA and just load up T3MA_Alarm only? i got plenty of MAs already and they just make me feel dizzy. thank you.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
well i guess this Stochastic Cross Alert might be useful for us. Attached File(s) Stochastic_Cross_Alert[1].mq4 5 KB | 1,341 downloads

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Great! I also have been looking for a stochastic alert indicator that will give audible alerts when the stochastics reach levels 20 or 80... I am hoping that the alert on the T3MA-alarm will be fixed soon so I can leave this indicator attached to my charts without it "beeping" at me all night.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
1) Use TF's H1 to D1 2) When an alarm goes off and an up arrow is formed for example, check your favourite trend indicator to see if an UP signal is confirmed. 3) If it is , try to go LONG at close to the OPEN of the bar NEXT to the arrow (bar 0). If the trend says no, ignore the up arrow. 4) Use same procedure for short situations. 5) Stops. You can use Parabolic SAR as a guide for stops. 6) Use a trailing stop based on the TF being used. Longer TF's need bigger stops and TP's These are judgement calls, based on experience or whatever. I would not advise you to wait for the next counter arrow because the next arrow may not be at the peak of the run-up. The latest version of this indicator is attached, its a work in progress. If the alarm annoys you change the "Alarmset" to false for now. That should shut it up for a while. Cheers. Pip2

--- 帖子 #81 ---
This is from post #1: 4) I have coded a very simple indicator to detect those peaks and valleys which appear as arrows up or down. 5) A built-in alarm alerts you when a new arrow forms. That's where it gets complicated. BUY on the formation of an UP arrow and SELL on a down arrow; that's it!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Confused...why did you repeat what is located in post #1?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Pip2, What is your recommended action in the following case. A new Bar#0 has just started with an arrow on the now Bar#1. During the formation of the new Bar#0 the arrow is removed from Bar#1 (because the direction is not being continued). What do suggest about exiting, for example giving more time to see if direction continues and arrow reforms? exiting immediately? Having a stop to exit? etc Thanks in anticipation. Mungo

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I cannot load this alarm into my charts. Anyone having a similar problem?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks Snobol1, this has addressed the issue !!!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Did you compile it first? Do you have it in the INDICATORS folder? Did you fiddle with the source and now it won't compile? Pip2

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I would look at a lower timeframe to see the trend of bar 0 . If in your judgement the trend is strong and is up say, I would go for it i.e. pull the trigger. So eventually its a judgement call with some input from indicators. Pip2

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Snobol1, The logic below should fix the alarm annoyance you've been experiencing. Once you embed this code into your indicator, take it for a test drive and let me know if the fix takes care of the problem. I tried to upload the revised indicator but the forum is preventing me from doing so - this is the next best thing. You will need to replace the indicator code beginning at "int start()" to the end with the following: Inserted Code int start() { double ax0[500],ax1[500],ax2[500]; double ax3[500],ax4[500]; int AlarmBuyCount=0,AlarmSellCount=0; int xdown,xup; for(int cnt=500;cnt&gt;=0;cnt--) { ax0[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",period,volfac,0,cnt); ax1[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",period,volfac,0,cnt+1); ax2[cnt+2]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",period,volfac,0,cnt+2); ax3[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",15,0.7,0,cnt);//trend not yet implemented ax4[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",15,0.7,0,cnt+1); double trendup=ax3[cnt]-ax4[cnt+1];//+ = up - = down if(ax0[cnt]-ax1[cnt+1]&lt;0 &amp;&amp; ax1[cnt+1]-ax2[cnt+2]&gt;0){xdown=1;} else {xdown=0;} if((ax0[cnt]-ax1[cnt+1])&gt;0 &amp;&amp; (ax1[cnt+1]-ax2[cnt+2])&lt;0){xup=1;} else {xup=0;} if(xdown==1){dnbuffer[cnt+1]=High[cnt+1]+(sep*Point);} if(xup==1){upbuffer[cnt+1]=Low[cnt+1]-(sep*Point);} } { if(xup==1 &amp;&amp; Alarmset &amp;&amp; AlarmBuyCount &lt; Alarmtimesbuy){ Alert (Symbol()," ",Period()," STOCH-ALARM 3 &gt;&gt; BUY "); AlarmBuyCount++; if(AlarmBuyCount==1){AlarmSellCount=0;} } if(xdown==1 &amp;&amp; Alarmset &amp;&amp; AlarmSellCount &lt; Alarmtimessell){ Alert (Symbol()," ",Period()," STOCH-ALARM 3 &gt;&gt; SELL "); AlarmSellCount++; if(AlarmSellCount==1){AlarmBuyCount=0;} } } //Comment("Angle of T3MA=",actualslope," Degrees"," Point ",Point); return(0); }

[quote=WHTenn;275562] Hi WH, thanks for the help. I guess you forgot to include something. Am a bit tied up for the next few days, tax time. I fully intend to fix it and post it eventually, the Forum problems did not help. I guess you can't blame them for being under attack by a bunch of losers. Its really sickening with all the viruses and stuff! Cheers, Pip2 PS. I guess you did not forget after all, I just saw your inclusion above, thanks, I'll include it and try it out.. Well done, saves me a lot of time. Pip2

Thanks to member "Jam" for his/her input, I have incorporated the fix and it is now ready for testing. I have not fully tested it yet. In the "Inputs" window of the indicator, select the number of times you wish the alarm to sound and it should stop after that number of times. Good luck. Cheers, Pip2.

Thank you for the indicator.... May I know how to enlarge the arrow? Thank you Eddy 1) This system is based on "T3MA" triple smoothed MA indicator. 2) I do not use the default parameters of 15 and 0.7, Instead I use 4 and 1.5(volume factor). 3) When plotted on a chart, T3MA will have well defined peaks and valleys. 4) I have coded a very simple indicator to detect those peaks and valleys which appear as arrows up or down. 5) A built-in alarm alerts you when a new arrow forms. That's where it gets complicated. BUY on the formation of an UP arrow and SELL on a down arrow; that's it! So far it seems to be OK on any TF but, of course, the longer TF's are better because of less random "noise". TF's M30 to H4, seem to be the best. Have fun. Pip2 P.S. As usual, make sure T3MA.mq4 is in your "INDICATORS" folder (you MUST compile it too). If you have problems, click on "Terminal" on the platform, then choose "Journal" tab on the right, you will see what's going on, and hopefully fix it. Pip2 [/quote]

I Already Use It Ure T3ma But I Wouldn't Apply At My Chart ....... May Be U Can Help Me ?

Its always nice to get help, but there is a difference between help and "spoon-feeding". readind and getting acquainted with the way things work is a necessity. I am NOT a programmer, but I have read and tried enough to program simple things like this indicator. If I have to explain what to do with a text file to make it work as an indicator it would take too long on the Forum. Please PM me for such help which is not in the public interest and will bore people to death. LARGER ARROWS: actually "Perky" a similar indicator, but not based on T3MA, uses small dots. I read up on MT4 and found that the symbol is called from the "Wingdings" palette of symbols. To change the arrow to anything you want, you must change the numbers in red. Before you do, you must take a look at the "Wingding" set which gives numbers to symbols. So change the numbers in RED and re-compile and your new choice of arrow will be displayed. //---- indicators SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_ARROW,2); SetIndexArrow(0, 233 );//This is buy signal SetIndexBuffer(0, upbuffer); SetIndexStyle(1,DRAW_ARROW,2); SetIndexArrow(1, 234 ); SetIndexBuffer(1,dnbuffer); I could not find larger symbols in their list so I settled for those arrows. To change the arrow you must change the buffer assignment. See RED numbers above. Please use a confirming indicator like Stochastics, or a separate trend indicator like LWMA(50), I hope to include LWMA as a filter to reduce the chance of an up arrow in a downtrend. My objective is to have one indicator that you can trust on the chart, thereby keeping it Simple! Cheers guys, thanks for testing. Pip2 PS. The Alarm fix does not seem to work, but I'll keep trying

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi sinyo, am not sure what you need help with? Good to hear you're using it, I do too, with success which I will post later. PM me if you need more help. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Why T3MA is not refreshing itself?I mean why its not recalculate with every tic ? Its not drawing without update the chart.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Yeah, I've noticed that too, I have no explanation for that. All the other indicators refresh with every tick, except T3MA. I will look into it and report back. Otherwise I will have to rewrite it or use another indicator which refreshes. Anyone with any ideas as to why it does not refresh with every tick is welcome to join in. I did not have anything to do with writing this indicator. Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Snobol1, Same issue here as well. I'll check the core logic to this indicator and get back with you soon. I purposely left the original logic untouched so as not to alter the signal and focused strictly on reducing the alarm frequency, but this issue has to be addressed to make the indicator effective. By the way, it appears attachments are working again, so I've included the revised indicator with the alarm fix for testing purposes. Let me know if you spot any problems. Jam

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Snobol, I have fixed the indicator as your above text. But there's so strange happened, take a look at this two charts. Take a look at the candle number 1 (two candles from right, the last ones). The other has an arrow below (buy) but the other one doesn't have it. The one with the arrow below it, is the chart that I keep opened, but the other one without an arrow below it, is the new chart I load to my metatrader. Could you please explain what's going on with the indicator? I note that there are 2 times for today it happened like that. This I mentioned to you is the second one. The first one is the Sell Arrow before the buy arrow which I mentioned. Thanks for your time to explain.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Thanks for the indicator..I will be testing it out also. Good luck with it

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi. I've been demo practicing your "The Simple System and it works well on 1Hour time frame. I've entered both the Indicator and alarm and this is how my setup looks. [See imagfe TSS Setup.jpg.] However, I've noted in your posted [35] that your setup looks different. Could you perhaps help me out on this? As far as the annoying contious alarming is concerned, I suggest the following: 1. Remove sound from Alarm. 2. Compile an Expert Advisor to sound the alarm. Then you can deactivate advisor after you have made your choise. Sorry, would have done the programming but am not yet into that part of this powerfull charting system. I'm still in my cralling phase. Thus, thanks for a very simple sestem. I've made 150 pips on two demo trades already using two lots at a time.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hello Snobol1 Thank you for sharing this system with us. I recently found it... I didn't find anything about stops. Do you use any? What is your loginc about stoploss? Thank you !i!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
BTW T3MA-ALARM_V2 does not correct the alarm problem... does it? may I try to help? !i!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
hai i have a question , why my indicator does not same and i my chart didnt have any arrow only moving average , i used indicator that snobol1 post..

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Eddy, take a look at the wingding symbols available on MT4 choose the ones you like and enter the number in the red space I sent before, re-compile and its done. Cheers, Pip2 I will TRY to attach.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Did you compile before attaching? Am not sure what your problem is. PM me for more help. Pip2

--- 帖子 #111 ---
No the fix does not work. I will give it some thought. You're welcome to contribute for the common good. Go ahead, what do you have? Pip2

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yes, your chart is correct but you should change the background to BLACK OR change all the line colours in T3MA to white. All you need is the first T3MA line. Actually there is a problem with T3MA not refreshing so you can use an LWMA(55) to establist trend if any, and forget about T3MA. LWMA= Linear Weighted Moving Average, a standard indicator which refreshes no prob. Pip2

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi, I use a trailing stop of 25 to 35 p depending on the TF I am trading. A fixed stop it a ticklish matter which I am not qualified to explain but there are lots of stoploss strategies out there just use the one that gives the best results. Sorry I could not be more helpful. Pip2

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Here is the latest version of the Simple System. I have included a slope detector for the LWMA(55). Linear Weighted MA refreshes and indicates trend all of what we want. In the top LEFT corner of your chart, SECOND line for Daily chart, you will see the slope of that MA at default level. Those levels, P0 and P1, ie. point 0 to point 1 are the points between which the slope of the MA is calculated. It is not the true slope in a mathematical sense, but it gives an answer in pips per period. So if your currency is trending UP at 60 pips per day on a daily chart, that's a nice healthy UPtrend and you would BUY on pullbacks and be extremely careful on selling at all in that uptrend. I have modified again, the code for stopping the alarm, but no time to test until Monday. I will probably add slopes for other TF's so you could see what other TF's are doing when in another chart. The H1 slope is of the tail end of the MA (RHS) and is correct for H1 even though you may be looking at another TF. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Those are the biggest arrows available, you can scale them down by changing the code, instructions in the program itself. Pip2

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Snobol1 Hey there...just wanted to pass along that we appreciate your work on this thread. Your dedication is great and you have a good system. Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Does anyone know why I can't transfer this or any other custom indicator to my MT4? I can do it fine on my computer but on my wifes computer(2 months old using Vista) they don't work and when I try to compile I get the message"cannot launch compiler". The indicators do show up in Navigator but you can't do anything with them.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
OK...another attempt at fixing the alarm annoyance. Markets are closed so I cant' test the change, but any testers would be appreciated. I picked up the latest versions of the indicators, so it should carry through any core logic changes Snobol1 incorporated since i released my first attempt at the alarm fix.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hello Pip2, I've tried to modify the file adding alarm control. Comments are inside the code. Alarm should fire once per bar when a signal is triggered. All the best

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thanks Snobol!! Am I correct in replacing the T3MA [15:0.7] with a LWMA [Period: 55 applied to: High?]? I read in one of the threads that you suggested to change T3MA setting to 28:0.7 and add it using it as a trend indicator. Question: To what should this be changed or do I leave it in place?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks "Jam", I will incorporate this into the 3x master if it works. I just did not have the time to do much this week with tax time and other chores. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thanks WHT! Pip2

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Thanks isto, we will try it out on Sunday evening - Monday when the broker re-opens, if it works I will incorporate your fix into the main 3x version so we can all use one version. By that time the arrow-size option would be known and fixed. I, for one , prefer larger arrows too so am sure many of us will benefit from larger arrows. Next project is to include a trend filter and LWMA(55) looks like a good candidate. When implemented, the Simple system should place up arrows only in an uptrend, and likewise for down arrows. And that will be all you need on a chart. If any more filters are required, they will be included in the main program so that when an arrow fires, you know you will be making a good trade! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Aubrey, Ihave stopped using the T3MA as a trend indicator, its a good smooth one but it does not refresh as the chart ticks along. You have to refresh manually and who wants to do that? I don't know what the problem is with T3MA in that respect. I did not write it. Now I use a good ol moving average LWMA(55) on close. So far it seems smooth enough and I hope to include it as a trend filter for the STOCH-ALARM. If or when I can solve the refresh problem with T3MA, I will include it instead if warranted. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks for sharing your system, it's very interesting, and I'm going to be trying it out on daily charts, so that I don't have to watch charts all day, I hope. I made a couple changes to the alarm, and tested it out on the strategy tester with the chart replay, and this version just gives 1 alarm per arrow. Also made the arrows bigger by default, and adjusted spacing to suit the higher time frames; 4h, daily (but this might make 5m, 15m spacing too big.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Snobol1, Feel free to incorporate whichever fix works, whether it is mine or the one ISTO submitted. No rush on this end... We're starting to get "too many hands in the cookie jar" so to speak, so I would suggest you review the latest code submissions and incorporate the changes that fix problems, and submit a new set of indicators containing the fixes, otherwise there will be much confusion going forward. Jam

--- 帖子 #127 ---
OK Guys here it is, not the Alarm fix, but the refresh fix. Seems the change in the code was only one factor, when I tested it on the Strategy tester it did NOT refresh: bummer. So I made a drastic change, I used a fixed "limit" for counting bars of 500. Now it follows like a little doggie. It refreshes on the tester so I have reason to believe that it will work in real time. I will try to delete the version of T3MA above, if I can't, just use this one attached here. Thanks isto and jam, this is a group effort. Pip2

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Snobol1, Don't forget to test the Pipsahoy1 alarm fix as well. Job well done! Look forward to testing your refresh fix when the market opens. I will not post any more code submissions for the time being until you've had a chance to review the latest code submissions and incorporate the ones that work. Jam

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I backtested this indicator, ATR channel, on daily charts, using it to show me where to move my stop loss, give it a try.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Snobol1/Pipsahoy, Please note the difference in signals between the 2 indicators. T3MA_ALARM is represented by small arrows versus T3MA_ALARM_FIXED which uses the larger arrows. Also wanted to point out that during my testing, T3MA_ALARM would stop drawing arrows unless refreshed, so Snobol1 , you may wish to incorporate the change you made in the T3MA indicator into these alarm indicators as well. Jam EDITED: Never mind, I think a simple recompile takes care of the problem since the alarms reference the T3MA indicator, so your T3MA fix should fix the alarms well.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Jam Thanks for the comparison test. Question, reference the 1 hour chart, when does the T3MA_Alarm_Fixed draw the arrows? Which time frame are you going to use for trading? Appreciate the help

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Snobol, as you were the originator, I suggest you take the lead in matters – I agree with Jam – one cannot allow too many versions from different sources as they will be overlapping and causing repetitive work done not being in line with the latest version ex Snobol. What I suggest is that all assisting in the program upgrading, to submit their attempts to you for your evaluation and possible inclusion into an updated version 1.001 ect., which will then be posted by you. That will have us all batting on the same wicket using the same info and when conveying info talk from the latest version. Not withstanding what I wrote, I still think this is a BIG Winner – Thanks to you and all adding their inputs.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
That's right, the refresh fix in T3MA also fixes the refresfh in STOCH-ALARM which calls up T3MA. About time frames, I prefer to use the longer TF's H1-H4-D1 I think the alarm works best on longer time frames. The reason is that the alarm uses a very short period and a large Volume factor. By doing that we are able to get significantly earlier entries/exits. So if a short TF is used there will be just too many arrows and alarms especially if you trade several pairs, as most of us do. You could go bonkers wth all those alarms going off. Below one hour IMO is too short. The broker is now open for 2 hours and it seems to be refreshing OK. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #134 ---
You're absolutely right Aubrey, I hope that up to now, those interested will only use what I post and not other versions. That's not to say other contributors are not welcome to help, any help is most appreciated here. I'll repeat, I am NOT a programmer, but I've picked up enough to get by with some help. So those with any ideas are welcome to PM me and I'll consolidate everything into one Simple system, with due CREDIT to those who participate. I think that it is important to give credit where credit is due. To WHTenn, I tend to use H4 TF but I do look at H1 and D1 for price action. Arrows are drawn at the peak of the T3MA(4,1.5) line on a chart. Place a T3MA line on a chart then change the parameters to period 4, and volume factot 1.5 and you will see many peaks and valleys. If you have STOCH-ALARM on the chart also, you will see the arrows correspond to the points of peaks. That's it. If an UP arrow forms and the next bar, bar 0, continues in an uptrend, that arrow will stay put. If bar 0 starts up, then changes and goes down, it will disappear, that's why you must check the overall trend like MA(55) before using the info of the arrow. STOCH-ALARM-3x is the latest with refresh fixed nut not the alarm. When that is fixed I will upgrade the version number. Hope this helps. Pip2

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Agreed - My only reason for testing using the short TFs is to check to see if the alarm fix code is working properly, which would show up sooner rather than waiting hours and hours for the next signal to come through. Many of us who contribute are under time constraints, so realizing this I would encourage those who have some of their valuable time to donate to submit your inputs here on this thread so as to share the workload. You don't have to be a programmer or elite trader to do this. We all have our talents, and working as a team we should be able to accomplish great things! So testers, start your engines.... Jam

--- 帖子 #136 ---
So the Stoch-Alarm 3x is the correct one we should be following for signals until told otherwise?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Snobol1, This is just an idea to ponder, but rather than use the MA to confirm your signal, I would also consider evaluating the signals generated against shorter TFs to determine whether to "Lock" the signal in your current TF. For example, if I'm watching for a signal on the 30M TF, I would check the 5M and 15M TFs at their Bar(1) close. If they all agree, then I would "Lock" the signal on the 30M TF before Bar(0) close to get an early start on a price move versus having to wait for the 30M Bar(0) close, or confirming against the MA. The MA has considerable lag and as such may produce late signals at the end of a price move. Jam

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Snobol1, Note that T3MA_ALARM_Fixed, shown with the larger arrows, is producing duplicate signals. See chart below...

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Snobol1, Same issue now with the T3MA_ALARM. See chart....

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Yes. when it is fixed alarm wise I will upgrade the version number, 3x that I posted last is the one. Any problem with the arrows? Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Snobol1, Right now I'm testing a fix for the double arrows showing on the chart, so no need to concern yourself with this. Should be ready to post the code segment for the fix soon. This will apply to both the T3MA_ALARM and the STOCH_ALARM indicators. Jam

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Also see if you can attach an email alert to this. It would be great to receive an email alert when the arrows show. Thanks for the great team work!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
No jam, I would not consider TF below H1. The period used in the indicator is only 4 in order to get earlier entry using shorter TF's than H1 will confuse the issue and make a simple system too complicated. Don't forget, the buzz words are, early, accurate, Simple. The less things you have floating around on a chart the better IMO. This is NOT for scalpers, sorry. The jury is still out on getting rich on scalping! My approach is choose a TF H1, H4, D1. Add STHOCH-ALARM-3x on it Add T3MA(15,0.8) since now it refreshes OK. Wait for an alarm and arrow, if an up arrow forms AND T3MA slope is up + get ready to go long. You can place a buy limit at the open of the bar NEXT to the bar with the arrow under it (bar 0). If bar 0 continues up and never pulls back to your buy limit you're sol, and don't get filled, nothing lost. When bar 0 pulls back then advances up again you're in business. Use Parabolic SAR or any other system to place a stop. Place a trailing stop of about 25p for H1, 30p for H4, and a larger trailing stop for D1. These are only rough guides, I was successful and lucky last week 6k to 8k on demo but I made a terrible error. I forgot to follow my own guide and bought USDCAD which was (is) in a downtrend and now am holding an 800+ possible loss!!! Its a demo, TG. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Yes it is possible to send out an e-mail alert, I will look into that. Have fun and profit, Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #145 ---
OK jam, would you please send me such info by PM, instead of posting on the forum directly. That way newcomers won't get confused with several versions floating around. Your efforts are stellar and appreciated. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Here is what I am using right now. A jpg chart and STOCH-ALARM-3x are attached. From here on that is what I will be using until further notice. You may wish to replace any version you have with this one and we'll continue from here. Hope this helps. Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Since it is your system, I'll stick to your guidelines. One can always create a derivative in the future, but for now, let's keep things simple. After all, we have bugs to iron out. I'll go ahead and PM you the changes once they've been thoroughly tested. Jam

It appears that you fixed the problem with the alarms. Tested it on lower TF's with success. Can you add an email alert to this indicator? Your hard work is appreciated and wishing many pips this week

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Nice work, ISTO ! Looks as though you nailed it with the alarms. I got close using a different method (global variables), but your bar count worked. I was able to get rid of the duplicate arrows, though, so I'm not sure if you fixed that as well. EDIT: You could use your bar counter method to get rid of duplicate arrows(i.e. 2 buys/2 sells) since that should work just fine. Thus far I have not seen any duplicate bars using your latest indicator. Jam

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Below is ISTO's fix against the M1 and Daily chart. This alone would make for a great EA! I include M1 to demonstrate that one alarm is being generated per signal.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Spoke too soon....multiple alarms triggered and arrows displaying on M1 chart.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Below is another chart showing 3 alarms generated on different bar numbers.

Hi I've tried to add mail alert to the indicator. Unfortunately due to mail server restrictions here I cannot test it. The code is quite simple and should work ... If email notification is allowed (Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Email-&gt;Enable checked) alter alert is displayed an email should be send. Please check yout Journal tab for error messages... Use Help button on the tab to see how to set fields... Please test it. Regards I

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I want to thank you for the Email Alert. I tested it and it performed flawlessly. Journal tab states loaded successfully as per your instructions. Your effort to fix the alarms, to add the email alert, etc is going above and beyond and is very much appreciated. I have my email set to where it sends me a text message on my phone when the arrow is drawn. Along with your improvement, I added the Williams % set to 14 with -20 and -80 lines that compliment it on a lower window. I now see one of the best indicator I have ever seen as a trader. Thanks for your time and your PM's. Wish you many pips!

Hey, just wanted to say thanks for the effort put into this system. However, I think there maybe an issue with it. I am useing T3MA and the STOCH-ALARM_fixed-3x. I am not tradeing with it, I am just letting it run on multible TF to make sure it does not repaint. On the EURUSD 15 minute chart, i got a alarm telling me that I should sell. However, the last arrow I got was on the previous candle and it was a buy. I am now 2 bars past the one that I got the first sell alert (9:45) and have gotten 2 more, one at 10:02:03 and at 10:02:05(with a bar number on that last one) and still no arrow. Is this just because of the short TF? tia

--- 帖子 #158 ---
update, the system just put up the sell arrow. it is on the bar after the one that was active when the system sent the alert.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thank you. I'm glad to be of use. Because I cannot use mail I did another alteration adding user choice to be alerted by mail set alarm2Mail to true (default) otherwise - to false Good luck I

--- 帖子 #161 ---
false signals? 2 15 minute charts from this morning. one had posted a sell arrow, but the price obviously went in the other direction. I opened a new chart for the same currency and TF, but the sell arrow was not on the new chart. first time posting images on this forum, hope this works.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
happened again, got a sell arrow, price went in wrong direction, opened a new chart and the arrow was not there

--- 帖子 #163 ---
is there anyway one can make the alarm put up the time an arrow was posted along with the arrow?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Seems useful. Alarm variant with date and time attached... I

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Sepak, there are two indicators you will be using in this system. 1) T3MA by itself, default params , period 15 volume factor 0.7 you do not need to change that, but I think you will get a more responsive line if you change the 0.7 to 0.8. Its not much, but try it. Try anything you think might work better, you don't have to follow blindly, experiment on demo and have fun and profit. 2) STOCH-...3x this is the indocator that draws the arrows. Do not change the default params unless you know what you are actually changing in arrow placement. Leave that one alone. Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes, I have not used or tested it on shorter TF's why waste time. Please read my posts re TF's for the last time I will not reply with problems occurring below H1 This is not a scalping indicator!! Pip2

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I was not planning on useing this as a scalper, i just wanted to make sure for myself that it would not repaint. i was useing the shorter TF so i would have more chances to see the arrows posted.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
To isto, please read your PM, I just sent you a PM. To others willing to help: thanks for your efforts they are much appreciated but we have to keep things in order. Please PM me with your ideas, fixes etc. so that I may gather them all into main Simple indicator for others to use. My policy is to give every contributor big or small, credit for their contributions. The status now is not good because there are too many postings with new versions. Some are happy because their fix done others not. So as I said, PM me your fixes and you will get recognition for your efforts. The next step is to just publish an ex4 file and stop all input from others, that's not a route I want to take. Making a good thing better is what this is all about so please help. PM me any contributions please, Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I found the same thing with 1 hour charts. chart #2 is actaully the first chart i had open. I then open a second chart and one of the arrows was missing. If I hit refresh on the origional, the second arrow does not go missing, just when a new chart is opened do they seem to change.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
evilmonkey, please attach graphics as jpg, gif ot png= It's easier to view them... Thank you I

--- 帖子 #171 ---
ok, here they are in JPEG, got limited graphic ability on this computer, they are not perfect. # 1 is the origional chart, #2 is the chart i opened after the arrows had form, as you can see, one arrow is missing. they are both 1 hour USDCAD.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I have read a lot of posts of people trying to do this and that to the indicator. This thread has been on for a long time now, and until now I have not seen one post with results from forward or backtesting. Does anyone has any data regarding this system? How many have tried it and traded with it..... or is everybody in this thread busy playing with the indicator?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I let some charts run for the day and notice these bad signals on all the charts I had going. I dont think this should be called repainting, if I understand that term correctly, it means when signal markers, like the arrows in this sytem, are moved from bar to bar as the chart moves. this just seems to be bad signals that for some reason, appear on the chart as it is being made, but if you make a fresh chart, they do not appear. Im not sure of the timing, as in how long it would take before the bad arrow does not show up on a new chart. is it as soon as it forms? do new bars have to form to show the signal wrong? if anyone figures this out, let us know, not sure if I will have a chance this week to sit and watch charts for any amount of time. here are screen shots of the charts I let run this afternoon-evening ps-pic # 1 is the chart that I let run(one with bad signals), #2 is the fresh chart

Constructive criticism welcome. If you want to tear down something find another Forum. Some of you have given freely of your expertise and that is appreciated and encouraged, but am not at all pleased with the constant bitching by you know who! This system works. It is very sensitive to the condition of bar 0 it MUST be. For those who want to bitch rather than read the thread, ( you know who you are), bar 0 is the most important bar on the whole chart because it is the latest piece of information about price/volume we have. Bars 1 and 2 ... 100 are yesterdays news, they are carved in stone, they will never change again, but bar 0 DOES change. As bar 0 changes so does the arrow under bar 1 if there is one. In my previous posts I have described in detail how the indicator works and the problem with non refreshing of the main indicator is also explained and refresh fixed. Constant bitching about an arrow there but not there is a stupid exercise in futility. Frankly, if you think it does not work, fine just move on and bitch somewhere else. If you want to test it contribute, or just offer encouragement you're welcome to stay. I believe that I have explained the system enough that I do not have to repeat myself over and over again to labour the same point. If my explanations are not clear , and you think your peroblem is of general interest; post it here. If its more specific to you, PM me with it. Am here to help those willing to learn and to learn from others as well. Again I repeat, STOCH-ALARM-3x is the latest version which I have posted. It has the refresh problem solved but not the alarm. Pipsahoy, jam, and isto have all contributed to the various fixes and I will cncorporate them in due course. There is no rush and one should not expect instant fixes all for free!!! So be patient, and try to develop your own fix, PM me with it and I'll add it in due course. That way we will have a free flow from one source, because there are now too many versions floating out there. For those who want statements I say make your own. Try it out on a demo for a week then publish your results. I have my own results which are quite good. I'll publish at a later date. I don't think its fair for someone to demand a working system with published statements, and every thing just tickety-boo all for FREE! C'mon, contribute something too, others are! Cheers, Pip2

In this world there are two kinds of people: Leaders and Followers. Leaders lead and accomplish something, followers constantly wait for orhers to move. And so they wait and wait and wait ..... and wait. Get the point? Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I've attached my latest trades to show that I actually use the system. The indicator below "Accelerator" was added to help define the end of a trend but it is not too helpful. You'll also notice the boo-boo I made in buying CAD in a DOWN trend, now am paying the price for my carelessness. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Snobol, don't get me wrong. I am not in here to criticize your system. I am only asking if somebody has traded with this system and if so, what are the results. I think it is a viable question. When you post a system you are subject to this kind of analysis. I don't think your defensive attitude is conducive to anything positive.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
alcastro, Right now we're attempting to refine the indicator so that it generates accurate signals (less duplicates) and incorporate an e-mail alert. I feel the signal accuracy is paramount even if it takes a little longer than expected. Once the indicator is in a state where we can feel confident we've addressed any potentially critical bugs then we can focus on demo trading it and perhaps work on building an EA around the indicator. My impression is that at this stage the indicator is reliable enough to trade with it in a demo account, but it continues to generate duplicate signals, so I would not trust it auto-trading it. After verifying its effectiveness based on pips generated, I would feel comfortable using it to trade in a live account. It looks to be a good performer on the H4 and Daily charts. If you want to get ahead of us and begin forward testing it in demo, feel free to do so. Jam

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks Jam, that is what I plan to do. I will post my results here. No I have a problem: I downloaded the indicator but the arrows are not showing in the chart. I am not a programmer and do not know what shall be done to see the arrows. Do you have any idea?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
This system has been manually backtested for the previous month and looks promising. The system is a good and simple system and I encourage you to download it and do your own testing with it. I got over 170 pips since ISTO fixed the error with the alarm and added the email alert today. Anytime a new system is introduced, it is considered not fully tested. One should do their own back testing and draw their own conclusions. Asking traders for their results is a moot question since all traders have different results. Check out the system and do a self back test. You will find that you like it.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Snobol1, It appears that no other indicator is needed - and that's the simplicity of this. I would trade this based on the Buy/Sell signals generated and not rely on any other indicator to determine the end of a trend or when to exit a trade. Seems to me right from your chart that in both instances getting out of the trade would be determine by an opposite signal being generated. The only other factor I would take into consideration is news events, but you can watch the economic calendar for that. You appear to be doing well. Congrats! Jam

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Wait a few days while the indicator is being worked on and then attempt to download. Remember, the time frame for best results are one hour and above. __________________________________________________________________ Jam...WELL SAID!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
alcastro, Once you download the indicator to the appropriate folder, shut down MT4 and restart it. Try to reattach the indicator on the chart again. If no arrows are being displayed, right-click on the indicator from the Navigator section and select "Modify", which will bring up the MetaEditor. Then, press the "Compile" button, close out the editor, and try to re-attach the indicator on the chart. If all of that fails, then there is something internally wrong with the installation and you could try to re-install MT4 again to repair the problem. To everyone working on this thread, I would encourage you all to maintain a positive attitude and direct your energies towards lending a hand in this effort. Also, please respect others and maintain a sense of civility - we're all in this together and I've seen many a thread on this and other forums crash and burn, so let's work for the good. Some of us are focused on the programming side, others are active testers doing demo or live trading with the system. Let's harness all this energy to produce something spectacular. I realize some of you may become impatient watching these bugs being addressed and not producing any substantial trading results, but bear in mind it is best to iron these things out now that have a nasty and costly software bug show up on your trading journal. Forgive and forget and move on.... Jam

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hey, im having trouble loding the alarm, i think i got the indicator up and running but the alarm thing doesnt seem to work for me...i dont see any arrows either.. just a glden line + some blk lines... TTY

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Try the attached indicators and let me know how they work....I've purposely renamed them so you don't confuse them with Snobol1's OFFICIAL versions. Besides the number of alarms generated, the signals *should* be the same.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I am getting an error message and i have even download MT4 again: 2007.04.23 22:50:10 Cannot open file 'C:\Program Files\FXDD - MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators\T3MA.ex4' on the GBPJPY,H1

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Aha! You need to download the T3MA indicator first, since the alarms depend on that indicator to determine signals. I've attached it for your convenience.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Jam, thank you sir. I owe you a beer!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
for me the indicator with the golden line works but the arrows dont seem to show up

--- 帖子 #190 ---
ansh, Reference the instructions in post #184....

--- 帖子 #191 ---
well it tried that already but didnt work..so i decided to apply it to the other platform and it works...TY for your help though. YAY it works know..so what time are we suupose to trade this and what currency pairs r recommended and maybe should it be traded in specific times as in News or just when market is calmed..TY

--- 帖子 #192 ---
jam thanks for your contributions. I have sent you a PM regarding posting un official versions of STOCH-ALARM-3x. To all other contributors to this thread, please send me your efforts and I will co-ordinate postings. Right now there are several varieties floating around and people are having problems and getting confused. This indicator should work for all pairs in TF's H1 to D1, I personally use D1. I'm so busy with house keeping I don't have time to include jam's efforts and isto and pipsahoy. Thanks guys. Keep em coming to my inbox. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Attached is another profitable trade. Arrow appeared, plus long run-up so maybe time to pull back? Accelerator changed to red, and a doji appeared before the arrow. All signs that the run is ended, so I shorted. Right now the trade is at about +400 to +500. Post your results for encouragement if you have done any testing. So far in the past 24 hr +$1,500, or about 150 pips. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #194 ---
OK OK , let's ne calm anout this but am sure if you read this entire thread you'd be aware of WHTenn for one has used it and is quite pleased with it. Before asking questions one should do a little reading and understanding of what is going on. Don't be apologetic about this, it happens and that's the answer. Nice to have you abord and contributing to this pooled effort. I don't know why I started this thread in the first place, but here we are. I guess I was so exited about the dramatic change in T3MA when the volume factor was cramked way up. So I hope you enjoy your stay and contribute and benefit from this endeavour. The reason you have not seen too many statements is because this is so new no one has had time to forward test it. I don't think you can honestly backtest it. I put the main algorithm in an EA and tried it for a couple hours, the EA made a trade and I chickened out and am waiting to close the position at a nice profit. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Snobol 1! Your System looks very well. I also trade most of the time on daily charts. But I have a problem, because how you said some posts ago, I don't really know which indikators I should use, there are to much of them. I tried the Stoch Alarm from post 165, and there I had yesterday an arrow in some currency's and today there is no arrow. Please could you post the indikators you use now? Or maybe you could post it to the first post of this thread? Thanks a lot for your hard work, and that you show us this strategy. Regards Erkro

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I just finished reading the thread in it's entirety. Thanks to Snobol1 and everyone who has contributed to this system. I greatly appreciate all the effort. I have been searching for a system to use on the daily charts as I work full time. This looks like it! There are 2 days a week that I intraday trade. If anyone has any input/experience on day trading this system I will be watching for your comments. Thanks again to all!

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Well said Jam. Since I am not a programmer, I will join the rank of the demo-testers. Hopefully I will be able to post my experiences and results with this method in the near future.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
hai.. could somebody list the latest indicator that have been use for this system...sorry i'm newbies and i confused cause so many indicator have been modify ...

--- 帖子 #199 ---
What time frames are most people working on here? Also, from the people that are testing the system, what other indicators are you using to enter a trade? Is it just watching and finding the trend and getting in? I'm just having some trouble in regards to when would be the best time to get into a trade. Any feedback, would be much appreciated. Thanks.. Marc

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Also, once an arrow is formed and appears after a new bar, does tha arrow stay for good? Thanks.. Marc

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Snobol1, Could you list which post has the latest indicators to use. While we are having people contributing by fixing bugs and enhancement it's making this thread hard to follow. I was thinking if you could you post the most updated indicators and changes to the first post of this thread. Then if anyone has questions you can refer them to the first post.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanks George...yeah, will be pretty nice here today. Although, that hot &amp; sticky weather isn't to far behind.... Good Luck with the system!!!

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Good 60 point profit in this EURUSD H4 session... Still long...

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi Guys, I am not sure how you guys get into a trade. When you see an arrow or get an alert, you enter market at market price? What are you doing when the arrow disappears on the next bar? You wont get an alert to your email or cell when the arrow will disappear in case of a trend continuation instead of the reversal signal.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hello Dan, Probably each has its point of view... I personaly use stop orders. As to disapearing of the arrow - this is a signal only - no one could guarantee what will be next bar... It is just one probability that could be profitable... but could be also a loss.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
ok, than the way WHTenn is trading it, always in with reversals at every alert is asking for disaster imho. He will never notice that the signal disappeared when he is not at the screen. I don`t want to spread negative vibes though. If it works.... just do it. Just be carefull. And one more thing: The indicator is not for backtesting visually. Since you will only see past arrows that did not disappear somwhere.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I'd like to share my first live trade using the TSS [The Simple system]. On the tha attached chart you can see my point of entry [unfortumately after refreshing the signal arrow was removed, but as Pip2 says - it's the O Bar that counts]. My stop is standard 50pips south. I entered two lots. Tp 1 is 25 pips north and TP 2 is 50 pips north. I closed the first lot at TP 1 and moved stop to TP 1 [break even]. I closed the second lot at TP 2. Thus in total I made 75 pips. [no bad for a Crawller!!]. To note is that I predetermine TP 1 &amp; 2. Prior to this I Demo traded TSS and had to simular successes. Thanks to Pip2 and all his assisting partners. I am looking forward to the final setup.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hello I downloaded the latest indicator, but the arrows doenst appear in my MT 4, i already try to compile the source, even downloaded fresh MT4 instalation and still not working, any help apreciate

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I can do that, I am most of the time at my screen any way. What pairs do you trade?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I dont know a better entry, hehe. What doyou do when an arrow will disappear? Reverse the position or close it?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Taunted, i had the same problem. You have to download the two indicators- the Alarm &amp; 3TMA, since one works with the other one.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
problem solved, thanks alcastro

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Can anyone tell me how they are handling the arrows thgat appear before the end of the period you are using? Are you taking action or just waiting till the start of a new time period? Thanks. Marc

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi Everybody, I've been avidly following your work and I wanted to make sure I've understood the result of everyone's hard work to date. Looking at the attached 4 hour chart pic you will note alerts that occurred on the #1 bar as the 0 bar was continuing to develop. If trade entry is delayed till the current 0 bar completes, and locks the arrow signal in place, you may miss the entire move. As you can see occurred on the GBPJPY chart on the left. Of course if you don't wait until the 0 bar completes, the arrow signal may disappear helping you to avoid a loss. The nature of the system is to always present a successful picture in hindsight but the reality is you will always be a bar behind on the entry point indicated by the arrow unless you gamble and take the signal before the arrow is locked in place by the completion of the current 0 bar. Does this rambling correctly interprit the reality of the system or am I missing something? Hope this doesn't sound too negative.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Yeah, it does sound a bit negative but I don't think you intended it to be that way. I am working on a system which will give signals 2 and 4 bars BEFORE bar 0 lol, Of course, every indicator is a lagging indicator, despite the ones that claim otherwise. This system is very simple in that I have merely plotted the peaks and valleys of a very tight T3MA indicator with volume factor cranked way up. I do not claim any other extra-sensory powers. I have cautioned users to please use a trend indicator while using this indicator. If you see up-arrows in a downtrend ignore them, similarly, if you see down arrows in an uptrend ignore them. The arrows are merely a convenience. When T3MA volume factor is vranked way up the lines go off the chart while the peaks move back in time trereby giving us one or two bars head start. So each arrow marks the apex and nadir of each wild swing you cannot see but is there. The last arrow is very sensitive to the state of bar0 and it could disappear if price goes against it. There is no magic or anything funny going on. The arrows merely show the state of T3MA at that point. If that's a problem, take it up with the writer of T3MA, not me. If an arrow disappears that's because the data at bar 0 have changed. Believe me, there is NO repainting in the code, I don't even know how to code a repainting indicator. So again, the arrows respond to data, if they change in any way it means that the data have changed. Garbage in garbage out holds true for this indicator. I have attached my copy of STOCH-ALARM-3x by popular request. This one does not have the mail feature and the alarm is not yet fixed, however isto and jam have offered fixes and they are being tested as I write (type). So you can download and evaluate this version and the upgraded one will be posted when the guys feel its good and safe to try on demo. I have not read the recent posts I'll do so now and reply in due course. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Am not sure I understand your question. An arrow appears after bar 0 has closed and now becomes bar 1. If the trend is right, you might want to take action called, or you could wait and watch bar0 forming. If all is in the trend direction, you can follow that trend. I would not advise anyone to jump in at the first appearance of an arrow. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Patience my son, patience. Always follow the trend, make sure you have T3MA(15,0.8) on the chart and follow the trend. If in doubt, sit on your hands!! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Snobol, when i talked about arrows disappearing, it was not just the newest arrow on the chart. for example, i can leave a chart running all day. that chart will display, say, 5 arrows in a 10 hour period, each on a different bar. If I were open a new chart with the exact same settings, there might be only 2 arrows showing in that 10 hour time frame. the arrows that went missing were either bad, as in they indicated a buy when the price dropped, or they were simply multible arrows on bars next to each other pointing in the same direction, which i only saw when the price was running flat. the point is that these arrows are not disapearing as the chart moves like you claim that they do, but they are disapearing when you pull up new chart. also, fyi, no one programs a repainting indicator on purpose.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I added the ZeroLag MACD indicator to my charts. In the past 3 hours, I received nine alerts with the GBP/ JPY pair. The above indicator helped me in determining which ones were reliable. Check out this attached indicator. This indicator does not eliminate any false arrows, it just assists me in determining the good arrows to trust on the 1H and 4H timeframes. This indicator, if somehow implemented with Pip2's great program, it may lessen the amount of ghost arrows. Fingers Crossed

--- 帖子 #220 ---
What is the loginc behing it?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Mine opinion - again one try to make good trading system. Mine advice - forget this system Reason - Arrows appearing/dissapearing ? ? ? ? No - Arrows changing. No backtest needed, cause backtest works. Live - very RISKY !! No additional filters or indicators can help I dont want to insult owner of this system, but he has to realize arrows are not trustworthy Good luck to all traders who trade this system.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Actually my friend, there are excellent programmers that are working on fixing the errors and as a team, they will develop a more improved system. Don't throw your towel into the ring yet. Patience is a virtue and these guys are really good!

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Appreciating work Snobol, thank you very much, the alarm one is excellent, you pip the market

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Since using the system as recommended results in the entry on pullbacks of a trend, which is a good strategy that many recommend, I'm curious as to the internal programming relating to the T3MA volume factor being cranked way up. Would it be worthwhile to rely on this indicator to identify pullbacks in trends that are worthy of entry based upon volume, in hopes of a contiuation of the trend, without waiting for the 0 bar to close and lock down the arrow, and if so, would it be possible to modify the programming so that the sensitivity of the volume factor could be made adjustible? Just wondering.......

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it make sense (and not be too difficult?) for the alert arrows to: 1) be shifted one bar to the right and 2) not alert if in the opposite direction of the slope of the T3MA (or at least have that as a option) ? Thank you for this very promising indicator/system and to all the programmers who have helped with updates!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes, of course you are right. I am working on just that part right now. As I see it, there are times to go long, times to go short, and times to SIT on your hands and stop fingerpoken! I also plan to recognize the Slope of the T3MA(15,0.8). A steep slope indicates an aggressive move in that direction, while a shallow slope means a lukewarm move. If you look at the top left corner if the arrows are on, you will see the slopes for H1 and D1 default is P0 and P1 i.e. position under bat 0 and bar 1. Those positions can be changed in the parameters menu. They can be set to any two points on a chart e.g. P0=25 means start of slope is under bar 25 P1=34 means end of slope (line) is under bar 34. So slopes at any part of the chart can be measured. A new version will be posted soon, as soon as it is tested a bit. It will be called TSS and will make all other versions obsolete. It will have mail alert sound fix etc. I hope I can deliver, jam has worked tirelessly on this project and his contributions are nothing but stellar. Also, isto and pipsahoy have contributed on this effort and possibly others who have remained silent in the background. All of you have contributed immensely and I commend you for that.

The period and volume factor ARE adjustable, just look at the PARAMETERS MENU!!! I suggest you don't change the default values of 4,1.5. If you do the position of the arrows will change showing much later entries. If you make the period shortes and vol factor larger you will NOT gain even an extra bar but you will get many MORE arrows. Of course you can experiment to your hearts desire but the defaults seem to work best for all intents and purposes. If arrows appear and disappear, its because your chart data have changed. There is no MAGIC in the arrows, they just point out exactly where the T3MA has hit a peak. So people please stop blaming the program and the arrows. They only follow The peaks and valleys of T3MA. I have said that many times yet some seem to be mesmerized by the arrows. If you don't like arrows then just use T3MA by itself and blame the writer of T3MA whoever that is. Manual backtesting is not effective, forward testing on a demo is the best way to go. If anyone just wants to look at arrows and condemn this system ok with me. If you want to try it out in a meaningful way ok too. But the decision you make should be made on fact and knowledge, not on ignorance and hype! Cheers, and the best to all, Pip2

yay! good job snobol1! waiting for the latest release (patiently) ~

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I have an update about the disapearing arrows i was seeing. after talking to a very helpful person about this problem, i decided to open a demo account with a different broker. i'm not sure why, but it seems to have drasticaly improved the system. the only relly odd thing was that i actually got 2 arrows on the same bar, signaling both a buy and a sell...i will look into this over the next week or so...maybe try some more brokers and see how they are

--- 帖子 #230 ---
EvilMonkey Hopefully the new version coming out soon will solve this problem. Hope that you get a lot of pips today!

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Let me try to clarify things a bit. 1) the new version called TSS, will have the arrows under bar 0 but will still be subject to price at bar 0. If price goes in direction of arrow, arrow will stay. You have a good point, if price goes against the arrow then do not show arrow. Sounds simple but think about it. Prices start in direction of arrow, arrow appears BUT price changes its mind! What do you do? Leave the arrow or delete it? If price continues downward when an up-arrow has formed, if left alone the indicator is saying BUY in a falling market. That's disastrous. So I think its best to delete the arrow instead of giving bad information. So by using a trend indicator which, gives an idea of how strong a trend is will give you more confidence in placing an order at the appearance of an arrow. If you are getting two arrows one down and one up, at the same bar I submit you are NOT using this indicator at all. Because that situation is absolutely impossible, here's why: For the third time: STOCH-ALARM uses T3MA as the main indicator. The parameters are length 4 and volume factor 1.5. When applied to a chart, you get peaks and valleys like with any other indicator. STOCH-ALARM merely searches for those peaks and valleys and places an arrow at that point. In order to have one arrow down and another up on the SAME bar is like saying you have a peak and valley on the same bar THAT'S IMOPSSIBLE. Check your indicators list and clean up your chart. Pullbacks: I am inclined to buy on a pullback if there is a strong uptrend and an up arrow appears, but be guided by the uptrend. The new version is now being tested by jam, isto and me, and will be released shortly. Hope you make lots of dough with it. Cheers, Pip2

EvilMonkey I am just thankful that an improvement is coming. Making Programs is like making brand new prototype cars. They need to be tweeked many times before a final version is ready. Pip2 introduced his prototype program and asked us to be patient. Let's give him 100% support and look forward to seeing the new version. Instead of challenging Pip2 with problems of the old version, let him concentrate on the new version instead. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Evilmonkey In an attempt to clear the air, I think you are misunderstanding how this indicator works. Arrows can appear and disappear in either direction, depending on the price movement of the current candle. Once the current candle has closed the arrow will remain on the chart. However if you leave your chart up for a period of time and come back to it, what ever arrows have formed during this time may not be there when you refresh your chart because the price has been moving during the formation of each candle. Only the arrows that were valid on the closing price data of each candle will remain on the chart. Once you refresh your chart you will have the valid arrows on your chart. Hope this helps. Regards pippocket

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Things are moving along here nicely. Jam and isto have contributed new versions and both will be combined into one effort. Next I would like to add trend recognition in the code so that you won't have to have a trend indicator plus the arrows on your chart. The built-in trend inficator will eliminate up arrows in a downtrend etc. The whole idea is to let the computer do most, but not all, of the work for you. Then following that, "trend strenght" could be a further filter based on how strong the trend is. Other ideas might be incorporated as the need arises. Finally this should be a safe simple indicator to make everyone rich!!!! Testing of the new versions including jam's revamp of T3MA are in the pipeline. More to come. Cheers, Pip2

keep it coming Snobol1 !!!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I'll be looking out for your latest update - found that the latter editions of TSS was not as reliable as in the beginning - but still worth testing. Yesterday on the EURUSD H1 I never received a signal - only on refreshing did it appear. If I'm on the wrong wicket please help me out. Attached is a picture of the trade in question. . Note that T3MA 070425 is the latest indicator I downloaded. I am a RSI-man and always use it to confirm a signal. Bollinger Bands is also handy if you know how to use it as a confirmation indicator. If any one needs info on both or either, I'll compile some data on it and post it.

Sorry, guys, but all readers of this thread be in one big illusion. Author of this thread is not programmer - it's true... T3MA - working - it work of professional but all like STOCH-ALARM-3x not working correct. quote 1: for(int cnt=500;cnt&gt;=0;cnt--) { ax0[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",period,volfac,0,cnt); ax1[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",period,volfac,0,cnt+1); ax2[cnt+2]=iCustom(NULL,0,"T3MA",period,volfac,0,cnt+2); We look bars from 500 to 0. Take last 0 bar, like example. Indicator take ax0=0 bar, ax1=1 bar, ax2=2 bar Than analyzing winding of T3MA: if(ax0[cnt]-ax1[cnt+1]&lt;0 &amp;&amp; ax1[cnt+1]-ax2[cnt+2]&gt;0){xdown=1;} else {xdown=0;} if((ax0[cnt]-ax1[cnt+1])&gt;0 &amp;&amp; (ax1[cnt+1]-ax2[cnt+2])&lt;0){xup=1;} else {xup=0;} __*__ *___* DownTrend (* MA) *___* UpTrend __*__ But in that analyze we use 0 bar - thats is already not good, but later we see: if(xdown==1){dnbuffer[cnt+1]=High[cnt+1]+(sep*Point);} if(xup==1){upbuffer[cnt+1]=Low[cnt+1]-(sep*Point);} analyze 0 bar - we print arrow on 1 bar and look at future on history that be ok, but on real.......... Correct me, if i wrong...

Please tell me you didn't post that before reading Snobol1 responding to this question many many times.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I am going to take a wild guess and say that you completely failed to read all of the posts in this thread. If you did you would have read where their was acknowledgement that the program has problems and that there were three programmers currently working on fixing these problems and look forward to introducing a new and improved version. If you want to offer advice, then follow the rules of Pip2 and contact him by PM. If you want to assist in programming, do the same. If you want to post negativity, don't.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Ok, sorry me for negativity - i don't wanna it, sorry again. My target not offend someone - my opinion is T3MA not so good, like look at first sight... See picture... Vertical lines - after thats candles clothes we may talking about turn of T3MA and on open next candle (arrow) we may enter... But we may know it and with TriggerLines... Now add STOCH-ALARM-3x - Pic 2 - very early enties, but in that points we don't know about turn of T3MA. If you wanna see right place of arrows do some change in indicator: replace: if(xdown==1){dnbuffer[cnt+1]=High[cnt+1]+(sep*Point);} if(xup==1){upbuffer[cnt+1]=Low[cnt+1]-(sep*Point);} insert that: if(xdown==1){dnbuffer[cnt]=High[cnt]+(sep*Point);} if(xup==1){upbuffer[cnt]=Low[cnt]-(sep*Point);} (see pic 3) too not so bad, but and not so good... --------------------------------------------------------------------- And... One indicator, like thats, not right solution - need more filters and Simple System automatic transformed in Not So Simple.... Some times ago i'm programmed systems like thats and they don't have profit on "long" history... If you have questions i will try answer and may be help, if i can...

Hi Oleg77, thanks for contributing, even in a negative way but I think you really want to help. Yes, its true I am not a programmer by profession but this is not about me. I think its better to try and maybe succeed or fail than never to have tried at all. So I will continue trying until I achieve a measure of success. Success is measured by dollars in the BANK, and not errors etc in someones coding. I take it your first language is not English but I applaud you for trying to convey some form of information which might be beneficial to all. Welcome Oleg77 to this thread and join isto and jam and pipsahoy and WHtenn and others who have decided to help in this effort. Like a seed that is not a plant but if you nuture it it will bear fruit. The fruits we are looking for is dollars. If you want oleg77 I can send you what jam and isto have contributed and you can make your own changes to it. What say you? OK? To others who are inclined to think like Oleg77, I extend to you the same offer of positive constructive criticism. Cheers. Pip2

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Oleg77, Thanks for pointing out the flaw in the indicator, however, I've already addressed this 2 revisions ago with the modified indicator that Snobol1 received last week and is currently testing. There were also numerous logic flaws that were corrected, resulting in a more stable indicator. Among the many issues addressed and corrected: - Signal will fire on Bar(0) open now and stay anchored. - Elimination of "ghost" arrows. - Corrected problem with Buy/Sell arrows anchored on the same bar. - Analyze signals based on the number of bars on the chart, not just the 500 so you can better track long-term historical performance of the signals. - Chart will auto-refresh now to correct the problem AubreyCraller and others have experienced. Programming code has been added to support this feature. No manual refresh will be required. If you wish to join the development team, you're encouraged to do so. It's always good to have additional help and a fresh set of experienced eyes to analyze a problem. Neither Snobol1 nor WHTenn have ever claimed to be programmers, which is why ISTO and I stepped in. If you care to join the effort, you're most welcome. The bottom line is making a money making system in the form of an EA - sometimes that takes hard work and volunteerism, whether it be on the trading, testing, and/or development front. All we've been asking along the way is for others to keep the conversation contructive, and if you spot any bugs to point them out, as you did, so the development team can address them - it may take a few tries and more testing before a particular problem is addressed - so patience is another key ingredient required around here. My goal is to get the indicator to anchor signals correctly on the M1 charts, which are the most volatile. I'm not expecting it to be profitable on M1, just be able to generate accurate signals. Thanks again for your contributions! Jam

Hello Everyone on the Simple System Development team, May i just express how fantastic help and support you have given to the world of Forex trading. I am really looking forward to the new release, could you give me an idea when this will be released? Regards, Gareth Williams

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi garethw, the revisions jam's post above relate to is in my hands and I must thank jam for pointing in detail what he and others have accomplished. No indicator is perfect, but we will try to approach that point. Yes, some more filtering may be required, but my philosophy is that any added filtering will be transparent to the user. All you will have is ONE, good solid reliable indicator which has many of the strengths of other indicators built right in. That way, the simple system will continue to be simple to the user, but the underlying code could be very complex. But since the code is transparent to the user, it remains a simple system. Now Oleg77 has offered to help, that's great. I think his contributions will be worthwhile. So while Oleg is changing and testing there's no reason why the first issue of TSS cannot be made as soon as isto finishes combining his and jam's versions. When Oleg is finished there could be another release. As to timing of all this? This coming week will be used up for isto's work so the earliest would be the week after that. If this schedule changes I'll post what's going on. In the meantime the 3x version is still usable with all its flaws now that we know what they are. Cheers. Happy pipping. Pip2

I want to thanks to all the developers of Symple System for your effort and your spirit to help each other in this thread / forum. Wish You all the best !!! And while we are waiting for the new version to come, let's see and forward test what the 3x version can do for us. Best Regards, Bom-Bom

Snobol, Jam, Isto and Oleg, Is this the problem you guys try to resolve? Please have a look a strange picture on this chart (the ellipse highlighted). The left one is the old chart, the right one is the new chart I loaded to the platform. When I took the picture, both running on the same time. Only the time it was loaded to Metatrader is different. Is it because the refresh problem you mentioned before? Hope you guys working on the solution on this while forward test the new indicator this week. Thank you.

Hi, I'm a complete newbie and this is my first post, but I'm following this thread with great interest and would like to be helpful if I can. (I'm still figuring out how to spell "Forex", and I'm a hacker, not a programmer so if I'm way off base, please don't flame me to bad. It occurs to me that since the Bar(0) arrows turn on and off (by design) while the candle is forming, perhaps there are some glitches in transmitting the final status when it becomes Bar(1), (one bar older in time). Could the programmers try using either a different color for the Bar(0) arrows, or perhaps a different shape? That way if you see the old color/shape for anything else besides the current candle, then you know it's a false signal that should disappear if you reload the whole timeframe. For the opposite problem where you are looking at a chart and don't see an old arrow where there should be -- which a reload ends up showing -- then perhaps the code needs a more definitive section to specifically paint the Bar(1+) arrow once the candle is fully formed? (Sorry if it's already there in the code, 'cause I am just beginning to learn how to read/hack this MQL4 stuff). Thanks, and I'm looking forward to working with this new promising indicator/system! pips4life

--- 帖子 #251 ---
To Bom-Bom and pips4life, et al thanks for your comments. BB, I think the extra arrow in the left chart above is an old arrow which was not erased for some reason. Its quite simple, the arrows appear at the apices ( apex plural) of the T3MA(4,1.5) curve. To prove or disprove an arrow, put a T3MA(4,1.5) indicator on your chart and look at where the line forms a peak /\ or a valley \/. At each apex there should be an arrow at the apex if you are using STOCH-ALARM3x. If you are using another version the arrow is moved one bar to the right of an apex. So if an arrow is not in such a location, chances are it is a rogue arrow from a previous attachment of the indicator that was not erased. Jam has included a statement to force refreshing of the chart on tics and when changes are made. His contribution is in the hands of isto who is combining both efforts into one. Oleg77 has sent me his contribution and am also testing it. Oleg sent a clock indicator which is quite nice. It gives a countdown in minutes and seconds to end (close) of bar 0, and is usable on any timeframe. Oleg has also removed the extra lines in T3MA indicator so now you can use any background colour for your charts not just black. I think I'll attach the clock and T3MAv3.1 in another post because they can be used right now since no more significant changes are contemplated. And that will give us time to be familiar with them. Cheers for now. Pip2

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Bom-Bom &amp; Pips4Life, Pips4Life...don't worry about being flamed - it won't happen with me since I and others have better things to do with my time... Bar(0) arrow should no longer change since analysis is based on a different method, so arrow will be anchored at Bar(0) open. Changing the color of Bar(0) arrow and direction will just cause enormous confusion and that's what we're purposely trying to stay away from. We're trying to keep things very simple here, hence the name of the thread. Ultimately it really should come down to taking Buy or Sell at Bar(0) Open, so as not to cloud judgment. Those are some of the issues that are being addressed right now. Stay tuned... EDIT: Snobol1, the chart refresh function was something that ISTO had already incorporated in the version I modified, so he gets the credit for that. Jam

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Dear Colleagues, I appreciate very much your efforts to make life easier. Could you say when are you going to release the latest version of this miracle? thanks a lot. Serggry

--- 帖子 #254 ---
EDIT: Snobol1, the chart refresh function was something that ISTO had already incorporated in the version I modified, so he gets the credit for that. Jam OK jam, thanks for reinforcing my points. Sorry, I thought you were the on who added the redraw function. Isto I hope you're not upset with me for this error. There's so much going on its easy to give the wrong person credit, but I'll try not to. Oleg77 has done a bit to T3MA and so has jam who has found and fixed a flaw in tthe logic of this basic indicator. Thanks jam. As a result I have added some credits to the banner of this indicator, and renamed so that there will be no confusion with the flawed version which should not be used any more. Isto is the man, he is working on combining the two versions. Now Oleg77 has had some input and I'll have to sort that out with isto. This will not be a miracle, far from it, but I hope we could converge on something which could beat the odds. I have attached the new T3... indicator which is now called OT3MAv3_1, that's the one with all problems fixed until another one is found. I'll also attach Oleg77's CandleTime indicator which gives a countdown to the close of current candle, its neat! Cheers, Pip2 Est time of posting isto's final product is some time next week. EDIT. Cosmetic change to OT3MAv3_1 sub-window name changed to reflect name change.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Snobol, if the T3MA had been revised, then should we change the code in "STOCH-ALARM-3X.mq4" / "STOCH-ALARM-3X_withMail.mq4" : Inserted Code ax0[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"T3MA"[/color],period,volfac,0,cnt); ax1[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"T3MA"[/color],period,volfac,0,cnt+1); ax2[cnt+2]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"T3MA"[/color],period,volfac,0,cnt+2); ax3[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"T3MA"[/color],15,0.7,0,cnt);//trend ax4[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,"[color=Red]T3MA"[/color],15,0.7,0,cnt+1); to this one (because of the new indicator : OT3MAv3_1 ) : Inserted Code ax0[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"OT3MAV3_1"[/color],period,volfac,0,cnt); ax1[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"OT3MAV3_1"[/color],period,volfac,0,cnt+1); ax2[cnt+2]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"OT3MAV3_1"[/color],period,volfac,0,cnt+2); ax3[cnt]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"OT3MAV3_1"[/color],15,0.7,0,cnt);//trend ax4[cnt+1]=iCustom(NULL,0,[color=Red]"OT3MAV3_1"[/color],15,0.7,0,cnt+1); Thanks !! Best Regards, Bom2

Snobol1, You forgot to post the alarm indicator that I submitted in the set, which should encompass the changes I submitted along with those ISTO and Oleg77 had made. There should now be 3 indicators in the set, namely: - OT3MAV3_1 (Revised T3MA Indicator) - TSSV3 (Revised Alarm) - CandleTime Bom-Bom : That STOCH-ALARM-3x_withMail is obsolete since I and the other developers made numerous changes to it. Snobol1 : I would strongly suggest renaming the indicators for simplicity's sake. May I suggest: - TSS (Indicator) - TSS_ALARM(Alarm w/Mail) - TSS_CandleTime Please re-post ALL indicators once Oleg77 has completed his work on all of them, otherwise it will continue to be confusing for the non-techies on this thread. By the way, TSS stands for: "T"he "S"imple "S"ystem! Thanks! Jam

--- 帖子 #257 ---
SA Greetings to all TSS affiliates. Thanks for all the effort to date. I think we’re on a good wicket here. To date I had 4 profit- taking and 1 loss trade. I installed the latest Indicators posted by Snobal1 yesterday being The NewIndicator and CandleTime. Two things now bother me though being: 1. Which Alarm works with the new indicator. 2. What now creates the signal setting off the alarm? To this I think we need to get to a Trading Plan, which one should update as changes to the system are introduced. This I hope will then remove all confusion. With all this said, I think we are still batting on a good wicket. Haapy Trading!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi Jam, Snobol1, Newbie that I am, yesterday I had my very first day paper trading, and if you have to start somewhere with some kind of system, I'd say this is, eh, quite a good game of wicket indeed! Since I have no idea how to play wicket, it's actually a good analogy, since I also don't yet know what I'm doing on trading, and it seemed so "simple" and fun. Kudos! I shorted EURUSD based on the H4 signal. I watched the H1 signal for buy's to take profit, and I actually correctly anticipated an H1 buy arrow 2 hours early (by luck), and my price was the same as when this mornings H4 buy arrow came with the trend reversal. I made +60 pips! I bought today exactly based on the H4 arrow alarm, and so far it's been +23 to -14 pips, but it's trending upwards at +10 pips this moment. We'll see, but it's looking good... I'm posting because of what I highlighted in bold in Jam's message above. Jam said that the arrow will anchor at Bar(0) Open, and the system will be to buy/sell at Bar(0) Open price. Uh, now that I have real-time experience with the STOCH-ALARM-3X version (using the old T3MA so far, which I'll replace with the update), I have to say I'm a bit concerned with the plan but perhaps I don't understand it so let me explain. What may not be obvious to readers of this thread is the exact time the real-time arrows actually show up. You have to watch real-time action to understand how the arrows work. If you look only at old charts without understanding the timing of the arrows, then indeed, this looks like a "miracle" system as someone said. Well, it's not as good as historical charts make it look, but PLEASE don't misunderstand me, this is still GREAT so far. A "miracle" would be that you can divine the future. The charts imply that's what happened. (Absolutely no criticism intended). Instead, here's what it's like real-time (using above soon-to-be-replaced version): You're watching an H4 chart that has been trending upwards, and it appears to have peaked. The 00:00 Bar(1) (00:00 to 03:59) is complete, and now the 04:00 Bar(0) has opened, and it's updating with live tick action. At SOME moment between 04:00 to 07:59, at some tick price, the SELL Arrow is displayed above the 00:00 Bar(1)! If the tick price goes up again, then perhaps that Arrow was a false alarm. You don't know until the bar completes, but perhaps you have a good feel, or you're watching H1 charts and, yes, it seems like it's going down, so good, you SELL the pair. But Bar(0) Open price is long gone, and it may never happen again!! You can't necessarily follow the rules to sell at Bar(0) open because that moment is in the past, and while price may retrace, you can't be sure it will, so you have to pick a price and go with it. More often than not -- which only live action can determine -- it will probably resume the new trend and the Arrow will be validated. If you backtest the system and if you could always buy at the Open price of the bar after the Arrow (the system using this prelim. version), then your results will be stellar, even miraculous. But in live-action, you may not have the chance to trade the Open price. (Sorry this is long...) To get to my point, if the new code anchors Arrows at Bar(0) Open, I'm concerned this will be too late. If I'm to understand it correctly, and maybe I don't, it seems to me that compared to the current code, the Arrows will occur TWO BARS later in time, not just ONE! Why do I say that? Well today's code puts the Arrow at Bar(1), one bar back in time. One could argue that's silly, because you didn't make the Arrow during that Bar(1), rather, you made the Arrow based on what happened during Bar(0). Now I'm all for the idea to put the Arrow over the correct Bar that causes it, because it's only fair to display something during the time you determined it. But if Jam say's the arrow it going to be anchored at the Open time of the latest bar, then WHEN did you determine the Arrow?? It seems to me it was determined some time during the PREVIOUS Bar! And if that's the case, then it's later than it could be. This is why in a previous post I suggested the idea of using two shapes (or two colors) for Arrow indicators. Let's imagine Triangles as another shape. During Bar(0), the current Bar, if the real-time tick price detects a peak or vally, then display a Triangle at Bar(0). Once displayed, you CAN take it away if the conditions reverse, so it might blink on/off with tick action. However, if by the Close of Bar(0) the trend is confirmed, than on the NEXT Bar shift, you leave the triangle at what is now Bar(1), and you anchor an actual Arrow at Bar(0). Now your chart has both Triangles and Arrows. The Triangle says an arrow was forming during that Bar. An Arrow which follows it says, YES, that Triangle was confirmed, the new trend is in play. If you see a Triangle on the chart by itself, you won't care because you know it was a glitch, or a failure to properly remove the Triangle, because there is no Arrow which confirms the new trend. This resolves the problem with the current code where it happens to leave some old Arrows around which disappear if you repaint. I have one additional idea which can give additional graphical data real-time. As with today's Arrows, and as I'm proposing be done with Triangles instead, can the real-time tick price which triggered the Triangle be displayed on Bar(0)? That tick price goes with the FIRST Triangle, even if you later take a Triangle away and repaint the Triangle with a brand new signal. It tells you that had you reacted to the first Triangle, that's the price you would have bought/sold. You can visually compare it to the Open price of the next Bar where the Arrow will be drawn, and I'm guessing that most of the time, it's going to be a much better price. THIS IS THE MEASURE OF THE TRIANGLE'S VALUE TO YOU! You can also get an idea of how often price retraces after the Triangle is diplayed so you won't necessarily have to jump right in immediately. Rather, with experience, you can make a better estimate. While were on the subject, can we please add the tick price which triggers the alarm to the text of the popup (text) alarms? It tells me when the alarm occurred, but not the price. Thus I have no idea whether it was the best time to jump in unless I study tick data or Minute charts, which is tedious. Forgive me if I'm off base here, but I think this may be a good idea to use both Triangles and Arrows as indicators, but I won't have a clue how to code it, and if the work is being done right now by expert coders, then this idea is (perhaps) worthy of further consideration. Thanks for reading this long post... and once again, THANKS to Snobol1 (Pip2), et al, for such a great tool. I'm eagerly anticipating the new releases, but the old one is already a lot of fun.

Hi Philip The new version is not out yet. It may be a week or so before it is tested and placed on this thread. The program was originally developed for time frames such as 1 hour and higher. I doubt if a 5 minute version is being considered. Great programming minds are working on a much anticipated program. I liked the old version, the new version will be great. Good Luck

Hi GUYS I removed the T3MA - old version, loaded the new one, but for some reason I failed ,(several times), to insert the T3... and the STOCH... on a new chart. all I'm getting is a line which belongs to the T3... . NO arrows! I checked the MT4 journal and it confirms that the indicator was - "successfully loaded" . It's the first time that I have such a problem in loading an indicator. could someone help me fix it? THANKS. gidi

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi jam, the 3 versions are now being massaged by isto and myself. Fear not, your version is there too and is combined with isto's. . Oleg's came too late to be incorporated so it will be released as another of TSS. There are minor problems with the fixes. In my testing I was getting an Alarm to BUY but the corresponding arrow was indicating a SELL, we don't want that. So rather than release a defective indicator I have decided to hold back and fix it or ask someone to help me fix it. That problem was not there in the original version. So please be patient fellow pippers, many are feverishly working behind the scenes to GIVE you a reliable indicator. If it ain't reliable its NFG ? Pardon my french, I just had to slip this in there. lol Postings, yes jam, I will go ahead and post the system as TSS, but the other two indicators "Candle Time " and T3MA fixed, should remain as the original authors intended them, out of respect for their work. Both you jam and Oleg have done some beneficial editing of the T3MA original. I notice that I don't get those crazy lines to the far left of a chart with your revision installed. The new names will be as you said jam, TSS for the simple indicator, Candle time ( Original name by author) and OT3MAv3_1, for the T3MA indicator revised etc. Isto and I are now looking at the two main problems, 1, down arrow but Alarm says buy, 2, opposite arrows on same candle. That's the first time I've seen that on any chart so it must be a new problem. When they are fixed, a release will be made, but in the interim, please use the new OT3MAv3_1 that I posted on page before this one. Cheers Pip2.

Pips4life, What you're proposing with the triangle and arrow combination as a signal confirmation warrants further study and consideration. We'll need to see what kind of signals the final revised indicator will yield and compare those to the ideas you have laid out. In the meantime it appears you have a manual system in place that you can forward test, and I would encourage you to post your results along the way. Try to accompany your posts with charts so we can all visually see your ideas in action. Keep in mind that Snobol1 proposed adding additional logic to the final indicator to check the trend before the arrow is drawn, which could improve the accuracy of the indicator. Right now the code is out of my hands and being edited by ISTO and Oleg77 and I'm waiting for the final set to come out. Great observations and ideas! Keep them coming! Jam

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Gidi, Wait until the final set of indicators are released, which should take care of the problem you noted. Jam

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi pips4life, you make some excellent observations in your post above which I have only just read. When does the arrow appear? Jam says its at the open of bar0 I said in previous posts the 3x version arrow appears, or should appear at the close of bar 1 which in forex the same as the open of bar 0. If you enlarge a chart to the max, and look at a T3MA (4,1.5) line on the right hand side you should see the last segment of that line moving up and down as price moves. To form an arrow, we must have an apex or bottom \/ formation. The arrow detector is based on the slopes bar 0 and bar1 then bar2 and bar 1. So there must be a peak or valley at bar1 period! Otherwise an arrow will not appear. As far as when to take a position I think you are really trying to split hairs. This system was supposed to give you a head start, and that it does. In trying to further advance into the future will get you into trouble. On an H4 TF you have 4 hours to make up your mind until the next bar arrives. Oleg"s Candle timer gives you the exact time to close of bar 0. That should be sufficient time to get in safely. No matter what, bar 1 must be established and bar 0 must have a stable trend for the arrow to appear and stay on the chart. Don't forget, the arrows are merely a convenience to show peaks and valleys of a basic T3MA indicator, I claim no other function. Anyway pips, good work, I wish you success. I lost 8k of my 10k demo last night. I thought I'd try a couple of new EA's, what a disaster. Am beginning to dislike EA's. Cheers, Pip2

I'm waiting excitedly THANKS gidi

Hello 2 all! Sorry for my long absence - need many time for trading. I have some ideas and will trying it - then show it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ But now i want tell some words about compatibility of indicators and templates. Please post new versions with add number of version, like: TSS1_1.mq4, TSS2_3.mq4, TSS2_4.mq4 etc... And then we may say: i have some errors (1...., 2....., 3.....) in TSS version 2_3 Simple to search error if know where need search And also - if in new versions TSS use new version of other indicator - then simply post archieve with both indicators for easy use. Thats offers to programmers.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
good idea Oleg! and maybe it's better if all updates being put on the first post of this thread including details/changes made to the latest release. just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hello 2 all. Thanks to sepak and Oleg77, your wishes have been received and I thank you for them. First I would like to make the changes appear on post number one but how do I do that? The EDIT button is long gone and I have no way of updating post number one. It sounds simple and good and obvious, but how do I go about doing it. It has not been done because I HAVE NO WAY OF DOING IT RIGHT NOW. Would somebody help in this regard? Because it would be the best thing to do. The first post is the anchor post and everyone would look to the first post to get the latest. So please gentlemen, I know what that problem is but I just don't know if there is a way to fix it. There must be a way, but as of now I don't know how. I have posted about file names before, With the latest version coming out next week, all previous files should be erased. This system requires ONLY TWO FILES! The main file, the indicator itself the one which draws arrows and gives alerts, is called TSSv1.0.mq4 or .ex4. The other indicator required to make the first one work is "OT3MAv1.1.mq4 and must be in the INDICATORS FOLDER and compiled. A third non essential program is "CandleTime". This is just a handy program which counts down the time to close of bar 0. It is not necessary to attach this program but its nice to see it at work. I think the best thing will be to bundle all three together in a zip folder and issue it that way. Then everyone who downloads the folder will of necessity have all 3 programs up to date. Right now TSS is being tested by Oleg, jam, isto, WHTenn, and myself. There's only a few hours left to close on Friday 17:00h. I have not sent TSS to WHTenn yet but I hope to do so to-day 17:00 or so. There is still the issue of an alarm for buy while the corresponding arrow shows sell, That's a serious problem that must be fixed. Finally, thanks for all those who have helped and continue to do so. Your support has been encouraging. I hope we can end up with a super indicator which is consistenly accurate. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Oleg77, yes, there are many versions out there now and I am keeping track of them. By next week everyone should clean out the old files and install the new ones I will be sending. After that all revisions will have a number and I hope to work with one rev. number at a time. Having 2 and 3 different revs. is like having many wives! It gets hard to keep them straight!lol See my post on this page for upcoming names (#269). I am not at all upset with the number of versions floating around, other than the resulting confusion. Besides that I look at the positive side, many great people are willing to help, that's what results, so its good! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Status Report: The signals on the H4 and D1 timeframes are clean and highly accurate. Keep in mind that trades would be entered at Bar(0) Open so a visual survey of the attached charts would indicate we are on the road to high profitability. On the M1 thru M15 charts I'm occasionally getting some double arrows forming on consecutive bars which I thought I would not see with the last set of changes, but I corrected some faulty logic and increased the tick data polling frequency, which *should* correct the problem. However, so far I'm pleased with the signals on the higher timeframes(M30-D1), which is what we would end up trading anyhow. I have yet to see Buy/Sell signal arrows appearing on the same bar for any time frame, so it appears that issue has been permanently fixed. Almost there! Jam

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Attached is a real-time signal on the M1 chart....well....real-time at the time of this posting. The Sell arrow stayed anchored despite price moves on subsequent bars. Note that no repetitive Sell arrows showed up on contiguous bars. More testing required though... Cheers! Jam

--- 帖子 #273 ---
The attached M1 chart is a continuation of the prior post. Two additional Buy/Sell signals were generated since - notice no double arrows and once again both signals were properly anchored at Bar(0) Open. That's it for now. For those of you trading today's NFP economic news event, I wish you all the best - reap those profits! It will be very interesting to see how the indicators perform during this monster announcement so I'll keep them turned on and will report back with results later today. Jam

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Jam, when will it be released? I can not wait to see it in action !!!!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi In using the latest indicators of the TSS method - I just made another 75pips as per the chart attached - THIS IS A WINNER!!!!!!. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Thanks to all involved. I can't wait to get the latest versions. I don't think one has to worry to post updates on the first thread. I suggest when it is posted it must be by Snobal1 as per exsample: Update 2007 05 04: Alart Indicator Candle time - I like this one! Another question: At 8.30am EST it is 15.30pm SA and my MetaTrader chart is 16.30pm. This gets an old man like me muddled up to keep track. Is there a method that I can have my MT's time changed to EST time. That will suite me, as I like to indicate the news. on the chart as show on the attached chart SA greetings to all.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
So excited! Can't waittttt Good luck on your workings!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hello 2 all, the latest is being tested and will be released early next week, barring any major problems. "Jam" I don't want to encourage use of this indicator below H1 and M1 is a no no. The basic strategy is to have a short TF in the main indicator, so using a short TF accentuates any "noise" in the data. I'm quite happy with H4 and D1 TF's if some are inerested in shorter TF's then I suggest another system. BTW jam, if your changes are significantly different from what I sent you would you please send me a copy so I could incorporate it into what I have now. No rush. If it can't be done I will just do another rev and post in post #1. I have been contacted re: posting the version I now have in post #1, i.e. TSSv1.0.mq4. The relevant files including a readme file will be zipped (now that I know how to do that) and issued as a package. I have attached a series of 4 screenshots in real time during the formation of an arrow. However, I do disagree with you jam on the anchoring of an arrow. If an arrow is anchored, meaning that, when once formed price movement has no effect , could be misleading. In some cases it may work but in other cases not. If prices go against an "anchored" arrow, that will be a disaster. Maybe am missing something here. The screenshots have been joined in time sequence LtoR and clearly show how an arrow forms just as price goes below the close of bar 1. Any detachment of the arrow from what price is doing currently will eventually lead to bad arrows. I hope this coming week will be better for me, after taking a chance and testing 2 EA's on a demo, am almost flat broke ($1000 left in acct!). Anyway, I'll plod on. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Snobol1, Think you missed something - re-read my earlier post so that it is clearer. I'm not encouraging trading on the short time frames with this system, and I've always stressed that - simply using the short time frames to demonstrate that the double and ghost arrow problem is being addressed. I really don't have the luxury of testing these issues on the longer timeframes since I'm usually short on time, so I revert to the shorter timeframes for testing. Related to anchored arrows, I'm not too concerned about that since I always use S/L to avoid disasters you're referring to, and I've also noted in the short timeframes that the indicator reverses nicely, which should also flow upstream to the longer timeframes.. Look forward to the final release next week. Jam

--- 帖子 #279 ---
OK jam, understood. I believe you did mention that point in an earlier post or PM, all's well then. This week I will try to seriously test the version 1.0 and not get side-tracked by EA's again. As a filter, I would like to filter arrows formed by shallow slopes. Right now if bar 0 is less than bar 1 AND bar 1 is greater than bar 2 a sell arrow forms. But if there is a threshold of bar 0 being less than bar 1 by a certain amount then the number of arrows can be reduced. I call them "weak" arrows which clutter the chart. A by-product of using a short period for the T3MA indicator. A further filter might be "Waddah Attar's Trend indicator. If that indicator or other similar one is used, a further reduction in arrows could be made. Since all this is transparent to the user, all one has to do is attach one indicator and away you go! Food for thought!!! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I just read through this entire thread. and I must say I'm impressed with all that is going on. Seeing as how I'm just joining in on the TSS party, I haven't had a chance to check it out on the charts. I'm anxiously awaiting the new package set to be released soon in the 1st post.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
AubreyCraller, Nice trade! Congratulations on your 75 pips! Hopefully these were live $$$. Regarding your time issue, why don't you go ahead and download and install this http://www.qlock.com You should really reference everything by GMT time. For news events go to http://www.dailyfx.com Their economic calendar has news events in both GMT &amp; EST time, however, I've learned to blot out EST and fixate on GMT. The time on your trading station is determined by your broker. InterbankFX, for example, uses GMT as their standard. I much prefer this since it eliminates the DST fiasco, and I have both broker feed timestamps and economic calendar events referencing GMT. Jam

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Me also just joint in and still using T3MA_fixed and T3MA_ALARM_fixed. A bit confused on others attached file or others 'fixed' TSS... Thanks to all TSS master. Keep it simple guys...

--- 帖子 #283 ---
TSS.zip is now attached to Post #1, this will render the informarion in post #1 irrelevant. There is a Read me file in the zip folder, if there are any general questions, jam or myself will try to reply. Any specific queries not of a general nature may be PMed to me . The files should work "right out of the box", just make sure that OT3MAV3_1 is located in the "Indicators" folder, just like TSSv1.0. Use a OT3MA(15,0.8) trend indicator along with TSS as a confirming indicator. Use at your own risk. If you become incredibly wealthy, don't blame me. Cheers, Pip2

Fellow Traders, In response to all the work that went into this creation, all we would ask in return is to provide us with feedback as to its performance, and any adjustments/customizations you've made to suit your trading style or make the indicators more effective. Please keep in mind that there may be some more fine tuning required going forward, but let's give this a week or two of trading to see how well it performs. Also, please post your feedback on this thread and refrain from PMs so others can view your responses. As we have shared freely and willingly, we would ask that you do the same. We have harvested the many talents of those on this forum, and channeled all the potentially negative energy into what we hope a very positive outcome. Thank you all for your support, your hard work, and the abundance of suggestions and ideas throughout the process! Enjoy! Jam

--- 帖子 #287 ---
While being developed and first test runs, was this tested in MTF kind of like Spud or Teb's methods?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi, thanks for sharing your system. I've downloaded new indicators, but when I apply them on the chart, the arrows don't show up. I was wondering if anyone else is having similar problems. thanks, m

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Drayco...not sure what you're referring to. Besides knowing that Teb has a thread on the forum, I'm not too familiar with the inner workings of either system, nor have I been following either method - mainly focused on TSS . Maybe others here more familiar with both Teb &amp; Spud's methods can comment.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Martini5470, Some traders were having similar problems - perhaps they could provide more detail. See earlier thread posts with a possible solution to your problem. Jam

--- 帖子 #291 ---
i was thinking the same about filtering those arrows. it might be a little better in filtering those arrows if we integrate the same concept/method like Spud and Tebs' .meaning that the use of mttf stochastic. but we need to blend it nicely and a little thinking/trick is needed on how to apply it into this great TSS so that it doesnt give any visual clutters where all the calculation done in the background. retaining the 'simplicity' of the system itself and only a valid and highest possible arrow will be displayed. looking on how Spud and Tebs working on thier mttf stochs, it shows how powerful stochastic has become. btw, its just an idea. maybe there are a lot better ideas than this one. anyway, lets keep testing this new release and see how it goes. p/s: Maybe we can invite TEB and Spud into the development team? or just get their opinion on how to improve this TSS.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hello martini and others, the most likely reason for no arrows is the indicator being called by TSS. It is very important that the OT3MAv3_1 be compiled in your Indicators folder. THIS IS A METAQUOTES REQUIREMENT!!! No indicator=NO arrows period. Make sure you spell the name correctly, any glitch in spelling the name of the indicator will mean NO ARROWS!!! With a chart on screen, click on "Terminal" a window should open, click on rightmost bottom TAB "Journal". Read what is there and you will see whether all files have been loaded successfully. Isto or Oleg77 put a name entry for the indicator being called, you should not have to change that. Try the above and report on your success or lack thereof. Sepak, thanks for your comments but some of the terms you use are new to me so you'll have to clue me in a bit. Am sure there are other ideas around and the basic aim is the same, one indicator meaningful arrows and lots of profits and minimal losses!. Copy of Journal attached. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #293 ---
all indicators load successfully,but still no arrow appear

--- 帖子 #294 ---
The newest indicators have just been released today and we're already starting to talk about filters. My suggestion is to monitor this for at least a week on the longer time frames and then ponder adding filters. If you care to add your own filters into your trading equation, feel free to do so. However, let's give TSS a chance to prove itself as is. Jam

--- 帖子 #295 ---
okay jam! testing is in progress... with no filter. only TSS!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
i have download the lastes tss.zip.. after i read the readme.txt i have know that the algorithm will breaks down on shorter timeframe.. thanks for all (the development team)...

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Jam or Snobol, so the best way to use this indicator is on H4 and waiting for the bar with the arrow finish, and when the bar is closed and the arrow is still there then we open on the opening of the new candle next to the bar with arrow? Am I Correct?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Man.. How to know there are filter on TSS or no filter?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Just sold GU at 1.9957 on 4h chart as indicated by the system. We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
me too I think it's a right move let's see

--- 帖子 #301 ---
My ex4 indicator keeps disappearing when I put it in the indicator folder. Can't figure it out.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi Martini5470, good call on the cable! I'm actually up for 25 pips! First trade with TSS!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
hm, try opening the .mq4 file in MetaEditor and compile it. This should automatically create .ex4. Also don't change the name, cause I tried to renaming it to simple.mq4 and it didn't work either. Hope this helps. By the way the short on Gbp/usd today was a profitable one. I'm went short at 1.9957 and I'm currently up by 26 pips. Not bad for a holiday. martini

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Right now there are no filters on TSS but you can use an OT3MAv3_1(15,0.80) as a visual filter for trends. For those not seeing arrows: make sure the files are in the correct folder, the INDICATOR folder which is itself in the EXPERTS folder. Also make sure the name of the basic indicator used for TSS viz. OT3MAv3_1 is entered exactly as the name in the folder without extension. Beyond that I really cannot help. PM me if you're really stuck. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #305 ---
YES! Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks! When I try to compile I am getting this error... 'TimeLocal' - function is not defined C:\Documents and Settings\Compaq_Owner\Desktop\TSS\TSSv1.0.mq4 (132, 36) Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
IMO this is a pullback from the trend and won't last, so be wary shorting any pair such as */USD. The USD is sinking like a lead baloon against all currencies. The state of the war and US politics all contribute to an unstable dollar. TSS is not the only source of info in trading but an early and helpful one. Don't expect big gains in shorting GBPUSD. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Good point. However, a daily pin bar is forming off of the 4hr and daily trendlines which are currently down, so there is a good possibility of some continued downward movement for the short term. We never know.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
never seen anything like that before. Try putting the indicator into experts/indicators folder and then compile it.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hmmm...I tried that. I must have a bug or something.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I wanted to attach my GBPUSD trade to help ppl use this system. 1. System gave a short signal 2. SMA55 was going down (slightly) 3. Stochastic (10,4,4) had a bearish start Hope to see more of those in the future. Good luck, martini

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I just pulled the stuff out of the code that sent a message. Don't really need it anyway, and I have it working now. Thanks for the help, guys!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
So the arrow formed at the 12:00GMT bar...after the bar was done and you saw the arrow still there you entered on the open of the 16:00 GMT bar? By the way, my GBP/USD chart is different than yours...my 16:00 GMT bar opened at 1.9946.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Correct. I also look at stochastic and SMA55 to confirm the trend. I'm guessing the difference in prices is caused by broker feed. I'm using Alpari UK for my metatrader. martini

Dear TSS Creator and Programmer, Thanks a Million, this is an indicator a good as it can get. I use Bollinger Bands 13 [ Deviation 2} faintly in the background with it.

To change the clock colour, bring up the MT4 Editor and open the Candle Time file. Go to the line number and column shown in the attachment and you can change the colour, font and size of the display. Re-compile and you're in business. Colours are the standard colours and the name must be upper case as first letter the rest lower case. Cheers Pip2

Greetings Snobol1, all, I downloaded from Message #1 the updated May 7th TSS.zip file which included the TSSv1.0.mq4 indicator. ITEM #1 (Bug): There is a typo in the file which results in the lack of any "BUY" Alarm signals. Although the Buy Arrow does appear, there is no corresponding popup alarm. In contrast, the "SELL" alarm signals work just fine. The solution is simple. Change two characters in the file as follows: ORIGINAL: if( !_dn &amp;&amp; upbuffer[i] != 0 &amp;&amp; i==0 ) { upbuffer[i] = 0; } FIXED: if( !_up &amp;&amp; upbuffer[i] != 0 &amp;&amp; i==0 ) { upbuffer[i] = 0; } ----------------^^^ Variable "_dn" should be "_up" as shown here. ITEM #2 (Enhancement): I'd like to suggest that real-time price information be included in the Alarms (and in the alarm2mail info as well which I have not yet used at all). I made the following changes and respectfully ask that they be considered for official future releases. The exact format could differ, of course, but please include the Buy or Sell price info somehow. My changes were: // Insert "RefreshRates() here: RefreshRates(); // This updates Bid/Ask prices but may not be necessary??? // ... before the UNCHANGED lines below: Print("_uBuf: " , _uBuf, "; _dBuf: ", _dBuf); if(_uBuf != 0 ) ... Then I changed SPACES (which improve readability) and text as follows: ORIGINAL: Alert (Symbol()," ",Period()," TSSv1.0 &gt;&gt; BUY "); CHANGED: Alert (Symbol()," ",Period()," TSSv1.0 &gt;&gt; BUY @ ",Bid," + ",Ask-Bid," = ",Ask); ORIGINAL: Alert (Symbol()," ",Period()," TSSv1.0 &gt;&gt; SELL "); CHANGED: Alert (Symbol()," ",Period()," TSSv1.0 &gt;&gt; SELL @ ",Bid); ITEM #3 (Enhancement): I prefef to have the option to display the comments such as: SLOPE PIPS PER PERIOD_H1 = -0.349 SLOPE PIPS PER PERIOD_D1 = 19.5145 AT P0=0 &amp; P1=1 After this line: extern bool alarm2Mail = false; I added this NEW line: extern bool displayComment = true; // Default is to display comment Then I changed: setComment(); to the following: if (displayComment) { setComment(); } else { Comment(""); // This is necessary to blank out the old comment. } (While we're on the subject, I don't really understand what these comments are telling me. Can someone please explain their usefullness? What does slope tell me and what are "P0" and "P1" anyway? Thanks!) I look forward to testing this in greater detail. So far, I like the fact that an Arrow which is forming is displayed over the CURRENT bar which forms it rather than over the previous bar which was misleading. As before, however, it is important to note that an Arrow may be taken away if price moves against the Arrow. Therefore, one must buy or sell either during the Arrow formation bar, or upon Open of the NEXT bar. On some charts, you may well miss all the profit opportunity if you wait this long but that's the way it goes in a rapidly ranging market. Longer trends will obviously work best if they can be predicted well. This is still a great indicator with a lot of promise. I'll let you know how my results with it turn out. pips4life

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Pips4Life, Great bug catch and suggestions. I've incorporated your bug fix and suggestion into a revision I have already e-mailed Snobol1 for consideration. Jam

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Any suggestion, what are the suitable pairs to trade wih this TSS? Thanks

--- 帖子 #322 ---
mbah_sanqkil, Part of the forward-testing process is to determine what currency pairs this system best applies to. Try GBPUSD H4 and USDCHF H1 to start. If you find any other pairs and time frames that are suitable for this system, feel free to post them on this thread. Jam

Hi everyone these are my trades with TSS Sell Eur Usd at 1,3614 (at the first bar after the arrow 18:34 gmt +1) still open wit 60 pip profit and with an initial trailing stop of 50 pips that now is of 30 pips Sell Gbp usd at 1.9956 (at the first bar after the arrow 16:20 gmt +1) closed with 15 pips profit. Sell Gbp Jpy at 239.26 (at the first bar after the arrow 22:53 gmt +1) still open with 66 pips profit and with an initial trailing stop of 50 pips that now is of 30 pips This indicator look very promising P.S. All the trades were based on a 4 hr chart

Hi pips4life, great thanks for finding and fixing those bugs. Jam has made the changes and I now have the file ready for posting as TSSv1.1. I sent jam an e-mail regarding the rev number and date that I have added to keep things straight. The source looks pretty ratty but as long as it works well that's all that counts now. It could be cleaned up at a later date. Thanks again and happy pips to you. Cheers, Pip2

Great Job.....Pardon me for asking but what is the updated indicator and does it still have bugs in it or is it completely fixed. Many thanks, Billser Don't worry, the bugs have been fixed by pips4life and incorporated by jam and posted by yours truly via the help of a mod. Look for TSSv1.1 on post #1 soon. It was e-mailed to the Mod to-day May 8 2007 3:20 est, p.m.. Hope this helps. Cheers, Pip2

Wish I would have seen this thread earlier. Here is a few indicators from codersguru that would have done it. The first is XPMA and the second is XPMA15 which has a few types of extra MA's modded in. There is also an EA built for ONE MA from XPMA, use any settings. Search TSD for this indicator. I also have an EA that uses multiple XPMA'S of any size type or whatever, based on crossing or direction. I am not going to post that because it takes lengthy instructions to set it right. Go to the TSD forums and search for Multixpma and you will find it. I need to publish the source, and I will do that there later.

Buy arrow just appeared on GBPJPY and I got the text message about a minute later. Looks good! Edit: Just noticed the pop up alert says TSS v1.0 while the indicator that is loaded is TSS v1.1.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Oops I missed that, I'll change all occurrencies of 1.0 to 1.1. Fear not though you are using 1.1 if the file name is v1.1, its just the Alert msgs I forgot to change. I'll also ask Antra to change the name of the zip folder to TSSv1.1.zip Thanks for pointing out. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks C.E.O., you have done a great job sharing your indicators with this forum and it is sincerely appreciated.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Thanks WH, Seems like I have planted the seed but it is the other contributors who deserve your vote. Seems like H4 is shaping on being the best TF to trade with this indicator. I don't know why but that's what preliminary results show. Frankly I am not too concerned about TF's, as long as I make profits; big profits and small losses if any. I just sent the latest to Antra at 11:55 pm est to-day and the zip folder should be named TSSv1_1.zip. I have dispensed with the period 1.1 for software reasons (doesn't work). Good luck testing! Cheers, Pip2

No errors in the compile, I changed the color to Red, exited and restarted MT4, even removed and loaded sucessfully according to the journal. Black background. Also tried changing the color parameter. Any ideas?

Would you mind sharing your thoughts in establishing Stop Loss and Take Profit levels when using this indicator. Input from everyone else is also appreciated. Thanks

THANKS FOR YOUR REPLY. I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK. I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER. I ONLY WORK WITH WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN POST NUMBER ONE. ARNE

This new program is really shaping up. Great improvements were implemented and the support you received was impressive. The testing still looks great.

Hi all, I too have problems with Candletime (and have since the beginning) getting it to display where I can see it. It tends to draw way too far to the right, so far that it cannot be seen at all! Even if I click on the MT4 Offset button for the chart, which shifts the bars left and displays a little more blank space to the right, the Candletime is still even farther to the right. I'm lucky if I see just a tip of the Candletime arrow. The only way I can see it fully is to click "-" to zoom out and then briefly I will see it, until the next tick which then auto-adjusts the window and bars again. Any ideas? The problem, for me at least, is not the color but where it displays. I'm new to MT4, and I'd also like to change some of the default colors for ALL my charts rather than one at a time. For example, I prefer green for rising bars rather than black, and red for falling bars rather than white. Maybe the answer is obvious in the documentation when I get around to it, but I haven't searched for it yet. Thanks, pips4life

Thanks for all the hard work that is being put into this.. Much appreciated... M.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
well then, good luck to all of us in this thread ... love this thread

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I seem to have the same problem

--- 帖子 #344 ---
If I make my chart big enough, like 3/4 of the screen, then yes I can see the Candletime just fine. However, I have double monitors and I set up 2 rows by 8 columns of charts and monitor all major H4 charts at once (until I get a better feel for this indicator). Therefore each chart size is about 1/4 width of one monitor screen, and I can only see the "&lt;--" of Candletime. The rest of the text (e.g. '89:14') is off-screen to the right. Uh, I'm a Newbie (but I learn fast), so what's the best way to screen capture and crop a picture and add to it some descriptive info (text and arrows) ? (By the way, when I started MT4 this morning, it placed a few extra TSS Arrows on some charts, on some older bars compared to Bar(0). A simple change of the timeframe and back clears them, e.g. H4 -&gt; H1 -&gt; H4. When I learn how to screen capture I will post a picture). Pips4life

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Try the software program "SnagIt", great for screen captures

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Anyone got problem on eur/usd Metatrader chart just now. Look my attachment below.. Please someone tell me how to fix it... TQ.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I have had the same problem. I do not normally have chart shift enabled. However by doing so, I am now able to see the candletime display. Maybe someone who is more familiar with code can tell us if there is a way to shift the display farther to the left. For now we can just enable chart shift to view the display time. Thank you for sharing your observations. regards pippocket

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thanks WHTenn for the SnagIt suggestion. I'll try the free trial for now. (Is there some free sreen capture program with similar features? SnagIt is apparently $40... no big deal. Earlier, I tried Function+Prt_Screen key which copied my screen to the clipboard, and then I used the free program Irfanview (an image viewer), but it doesn't seem to draw the circles and text as easily as SnagIt). I'm posting a screen shot. Each chart size is about 1/4 width of one monitor screen, and I can only see the "&lt;--" of Candletime. The rest of the text (e.g. '89:14') is off-screen to the right. If I make the chart 3/4 size, I can see all of Candletime. To repeat what I said before, I started MT4 this morning, and it placed a few extra TSS Arrows on some charts, on some older bars compared to Bar(0). A simple change of the timeframe and back clears them, e.g. H4 -&gt; H1 -&gt; H4. I did another restart just now and the extra arrows do NOT occur, so I don't know how to reproduce this, only that it happened earlier today. Pips4life

--- 帖子 #349 ---
You can go to Tools &gt; History Center and edit that bar. Thats what I would do. As long as its there you'll see a messed up chart everytime you scroll back to that area.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi pips, sorry to hear your candle time is not displaying properly. See the attachment. Before the &lt;-- (TIME) there are many SPACES, remove some of those spaces and see if it helps. You can change The colour, Font face and Font all on the same line. This is a very short program and its innards are bare, no tricky code here. Hope this helps. Cheers, Pip2 P.S. How to capture a screen. If you are using XP then OK otherwise I can't help, I know only XP and W98 (obsolete) Press "PrtScrn" on your keyboard and the screen will be captured instantly in the windows "Clipbook". Next open any graphics software, I use "irfan", its free and it even plays videos. With your software open just paste the Clipbook image to the graphics software then crop, enlarge, reduce etc. to your hearts contents then save as a .jpg image. That's it. I usually place my screenshots on the deaktop and take is from there in a Browse window. That should work OK. Pip2

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi pips, no need to spend $40. Irfan is free on the web, just do a Google search and download and use it. I have been using it for several years. I use it to make my own icons or to change .jpg to .gif or png or tiff, or what have you. Its a very versatile program and it is entirely FREE! See attached. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Here is some more direct infor for you attached. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Seems like you have bad data. There seems to be nothing wrong with your screen. The problem is the long green line going South on your chart. Metaquotes charts are "dynamic", meaning that you do not have to constantly scroll up and down to get current prices on the chart. What has happened is that Metaquotes has shrunk the chart vertically so that you will ALWAYS get current prices on the screen. To solve your problem of bad data, you will have to go to TOOLS then HISTORY CENTER, then click on the pair and TF in question and manually change the bad data. Change to anything reasonable e.g. duplicate the previous line. Save changes and you're in business. Or you can just delete the offending line and your chart will be back as usual. If you dont do that, the chart will remain like that until the offending line goes off screen as time goes on. Hope this helps. Its not a Metaquotes problem. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #354 ---
ChartShift and 15 spaces in the indicator seem to work for most zoom factors. Thanks for everyones help. George

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Has anyone had better results on the 1 hr tf vs the 4 hr? Any feedback, would be appreciated. Thanks.. M.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi George, Thanks for the suggestion to change Candletime spacing. I already use ChartShift, and I decided on 20 spaces in combination with 9-point font. The line in my code is now: ObjectSetText("time", " &lt;--"+m+":"+s, 9, "Verdana", Yellow); It works great for all but the most narrow of Chart windows. And to Snobol1, Thanks for the tips on Irfan, but I guess you missed that I did already try that (a.k.a. "IrfanView"). I downloaded the latest today, and yes, it captures images, but am I missing something about drawing arrows, lines, circles, etc. with IrfanView? It doesn't seem to include any such capability, so I can't as easily add notations to the picture. The $40 SnagIt program does have this capability. Is there another "free" Drawing/Art/Image-editing software someone can recommend? (Otherwise I'll probably spend the $40 for the added capabilities of SnagIt). Pips4life

--- 帖子 #357 ---
On GBP/USD 4 hr TF...buy arrow at the 4 GMT bar...coupled with divergence(CCI 14) at support was a good buy signal.(wish I would have taken it!). My candle time doesn't show up either but I don't friggin care because I believe the arrows this is showing on the 4 hr TFs are really good signals that can be the basis for a great system with or without filters.... I would like to see some suggestions on SLs and targets strategies to maximize the full power of this indicator.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I read this Thread several times today and am looking at the charts with the indicators on it. There has been some talk of the arrow appearing and disappearing during the candle being open. I thought on this as I biked home and wondered about a MTF version. eg. On the 4Hr you could paint an arrow of different colours from the 4 individual 1 Hr candles making up that bar. (The daily candle would need 6) Red - 1st hour has a signal Orange - 2nd hour has a signal Yellow - 3rd hour has a signal White - current hourly and 4 hour bar are getting a signal. Does this make sense or am I mistaken? Would it work? Or even make it a Histogram in a separate window. Tossing out an Idea, Labrat407

--- 帖子 #359 ---
You give up so quickly my friend, free is beautiful. For circles text etc I just do that on the Meta platform and copy the screen already fixed up so irfan does not have to do that. Maybe there is another free program like Snagit at TuCows who knows. Poke around and am sure you'll find something. I hate to part with my dollars, its in my nature.lol. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Very good labrat, I think every idea is a good idea until proven otherwise. Different arrow colours will certainly complicate the code and maybe confuse the first time user and others who don't know what all the different colours mean. Candle Time gives a countdown to close of current candle. So it has the same effect. I tend to shy away from separate window indicators, but that's just my own personal preference. I'll have to think about your idea a little more to see if there is a need for it. But the main thing is to keep on thinking and biking!! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Here is another version of CandleTime displayed below the last bars and no space. This should fit all charts with a shifted display. See attachments. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Snobol1, all, Well I'm really glad my very first day with this system was up +60 pips because I was down the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days! Today was especially tough, as nothing seemed to go as I hoped, and I sat out some of the better gains while taking some of the bigger losses. I monitored H4 charts for 12 major pairs and waited for Arrows and then sometimes I tried to 2nd-guess the action BEFORE the next bar opening, other times I waited for the next bar. I'm really learning from my mistakes. I *think* I'm learning to make entries according to Arrows only, however, the exits I think can be done using the *formation* of an Arrow. This needs more real-time testing though to be sure. One must also give a LOT of stop-loss room, far more than the 20 pips or so I tended to give. I just went through a chart analysis on a pair I did not happen to trade but is illustrative of the issues I ran into. Check out this USDCHF,H4 chart for about the last 10 days. It's important to study this un-annotated chart before you see the annotated chart which follows.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Observe the annotated USDCHF,H4 chart below for the past 10 days. I'm sorry it's so full of information, but I hope it will be worth it to review. I'm in the U.S. at MT (GMT-6). The olive shaded area represents my daytime hours from 8AM-8PM. Sure I can get up earlier or stay later on any give day, but to make a trade per-the-rules, you must trade the Open price of the bar following an Arrow. Therefore you can see some Arrows occurred during "off" hours when it would be very rough to catch the proper trade time. The vertical peach-color lines are weekends. Perhaps one would liquidate any open Friday positions, or avoid opening on Sundays, so the profit or loss over a weekend could differ from my analysis. Item #1: Following a Down Arrow, Short-Sell on Open of the NEXT bar. Item A: This is the weekend. If you Cover-Buy on Friday, you make a nice profit, from +20 (at market close) to maybe even +60 pips the bar before, (but you are GUESSING the bottom to get +60!). Item #2: MAYBE I skip this Up Arrow because I'm asleep! But assuming I'm up 24 hours a day ;-) then on the first bar AFTER the Up Arrow, you Cover Buy at a slight loss around -5 pips (inc. spread). You also Buy a new lot. Item B (Blue): You must have one heckuva big stop loss to survive this drop against your Buy, something like ~50 pips (inc. spread). If you were only 40 pips SL, you stopped out -40 pip loss! Item #3: After a Down Arrow, next bar, you Sell at a loss of -20 pips. You also Sell a new lot. However, price moves against you from #3 to #4 about -39 pips. You barely survive the stop loss if you were -40 SL. Item #4: Ultimately though, Buy back at a -35 pip loss. You also Buy a new lot. Item C: Once again, price moves against you about -45 pips. If your SL is -40, you lose -40 pips. If SL is 50, then you survive and it recovers sharply upwards. Item #5: This is an interesting situation. Price rose considerably but retraced. If you watched the Down Arrow form during the Bar before #5, you might have a chance to Sell your Open Buy position for +60 pips (the peak gain is +90 (from #4 to peak of "Item D"), but if you follow the "rules", you sell at the next open Bar. Your gain is just +40. Item D is the 50 pips you missed (unless you had trailing stops of some kind). You also Sell a new lot. Item E: If you watch the Up Arrow form, you *might* Cover Buy for a +10 pips. However, the "rules" have you stay in the game for the next bar. Item #6: After an Up Arrow, you Cover Buy at a -20 loss (with spread). You Buy a new lot. Item #7: A Down Arrow forms. Next bar you Sell at a -3 pip (spread-1) loss. You Sell a new lot. (If you close for the weekend, you gain about +40). If you stay in the trade over the weekend, you keep it through Sunday night. Item #8: Monday, you Cover Buy for +50 gain. You Buy a new lot. You keep it open through Monday night and all of Tuesday. Item #9: Tuesday, very late (midnight) you Sell for +80 gain. You Sell a new lot and go to bed. Item #10: Unless you Cover Bought early, without an indicator, you watch an Up Arrow form. You DON'T KNOW if the Up Arrow will persist or not until the bar closes! Presuming it doesn't change much, and the Arrow persists, you Cover Buy for a -15 pip loss at around midnight on Wednesday! Summary of official Buy/Sell at the bar open price after every arrow, if your: SL was 50: -5, -20, -35, +40, -20, -3, +50, +80, -15 = +72 net SL was 40: -5, -40, -35, -40, -20, -3, +50, +80, -15 = -28 net SL was 50, but you exited before weekends, AND anticipated arrows to close open positions early for a bigger profit. You entered positions, however, only on Arrows: +20, -20, -35, +60, +10, -3, +40, +80, -15 = +137 net !!! Well, +72 for 2 weeks is a net gain, but you have 3 gains, 6 losses. And -28 loss due to -40 SL not being big enough, that sucks. But +137 gain using a bit of 2nd-guessing on exits is perhaps best. However, that's about +14/day; good but not great. The moral seems to be: #1: BIG stop losses can help stay in the game. (I did NOT analyze small SL's, but this may be another way that could limit the downside better???). #2: If you close open positions early while an Arrow is forming, you might preserve some gains. (Maybe a trailing stop would work even better???) #3: We need some additional indicators to prevent taking what turn out to be "weak" arrows but without missing out on the big gains! #4: To trade the system fully, you need to be awake 24 hours/day! LOL Pips4life

--- 帖子 #364 ---
P.S. to my above recent chart analysis: 1. My local time for H4 candles open/closing is actually not 8A-8P, but is instead 10A-10P, or specifically 10A, 2P, 6P, 10P (close). (MDT). I guess I can get up early at 6AM to use one more candle, but I'm unlikely to stay up until 2AM to see the late candles fully formed to trade on Open bars then. 2. I was not at all precise in my measurements of +/- pips on the chart. I eyeballed them, and assumed a 4-pip spread. 3. I don't know how to formally backtest. I'm new to MT4, so if anyone has any specific recommendations on how to backtest this method, or where to read about it, I'd appreciate it. 4. Now that we have updated TSSv1_1.mt4 code, has someone backtested it, and can the results be posted? Which pairs work best? 5. I said I averaged the +137 pip gain over "10" days, but really I should have said only 8 days, or more like +17 pips/day for this one pair. That assumes you exit early, while Arrows are forming, rather than are fully formed. Also, exit on Fridays. Also, a big 50 pip SL is assumed.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
It's been a while since I've been on this thread, but if I recall, this method really works well in trending markets, not so well in ranging ones, like it seems the chart you posted above. When the market is choppy, indicators that work well on trends don't work so well--rather, oscillators and the like are more well suited.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Excellent work pips4life. You have moved us forward quite a bit in this endeavour. Backtesting could be too subjective to be accurate but it helps a bit. Yes; the longer TF's require larger stops. I always use a trailing stop based on the rough average pips (H-L) of bars near bar 0. Stop losses are something else. I don't trust them, just like insurance companies, they're a necessary evil. You can use Parabolic SAR to place stops because that's what that indicator was designed for from my research on indicators. In a long trend, P. SAR could act as a trailing stop because it reduces the stop as the trend progresses. Anyway pips4life, keep up the good work, we all love you for it. Cheers, Pip2 P.S. I did a search on Google for free screen capture software, and got 177000 hits. I checked the first hit and found the attached one. Hope you can use it. Sorry can't attach it, file exceeds Forum limit.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
You're absolutely right but ranging markets vary widely and some good ranges could yield many pips while others might yield losses. If the range is narrow and choppy I would sit on my hands, especially the index finger that does all the clicking. But if a range is wide, say 50 to 90 pips, bouncing from lower Boll Band to Upper Boll band, you will see arrows above and below the bands and those could be very profitable. So the nature of the range is important in determining if it could be profitable. Cheers, Pip2

Here is a way to do screen capture free. just click the print screen button after clicking print screen then just do a paste to windows paint brush. If you have a digital camera that came with some kind of photo software you can paste to it also. If you have multi monitors put the cursor on the one you want to capture and then click the alt and print screen buttons at the same time and you have captured that one monitor. hope this helps

Hey marcf, wanna ask, what indicators do u use in that chart ? btw, thx for u'r time on this thread

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Snobol1, here is the .mqh file This is my Entry. When an arrow appears and the Jurx indicator is in-line. You enter at the close of that candle stick. Works great on both 1 hour and 4 hours. This helps eliminate "false" arrows.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I'm using the 3C_Jurx indicator and the Waddah Attar Explosion. Thanks.. M.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Yes marcf, that's a good idea to use a confirming indicator until some filters are added to TSS. At present TSS gives early entries but, by the nature of the algorithm involved, it also gives some false signals which have to be filtered manually. Eng Attar has many indicators on the Metaquotes website. He (she) is a very prolific writer of mq4. His EA "Trend Me Leave Me" seems like an EA I'd like to try, but I need more time to decipher the use of it. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Snobol1, Thanks for sharing this excellent system. As a trader always learning, I always try to read through all pages of interesting and promising threads. My eyes are tired glancing all day long. If you please update the latest indicators, template, instructions in the very first post, I would be grateful. I am not moaning about reading all pages, but if this thread grow very long, my suggestion will help. Thanks. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hi Mega, this has already been brought up and solved. The latest and greatest are attached to the first post, thanks to Mod Antra. Its there, did you look before asking? TSS 1.0 was the first then TSS1_1 was attached after some preliminary bugs were fixed. There will be other revisions coming when submitted or when I have time to work on it. But rest assured that the latest will always be in the first post!!!! Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi Snobol1, Really thanks, I never realised that, I read first four pages and thought the new updated files are somewhere in the middle, and came to the last 4 pages and as I didn't find any, I asked your help. Sorry for that. Really well designed, great method to folllow, I am going try this coming week. Best Regards. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

I think if we add these 2 indicators for now, it could give us better entries and exits.....so, far it looks pretty good.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I haven't figured out this supplemental indicator, 3c_JurX.mt4, but I do know that the include file, 3Color.mqh, must go into the "include" folder which is PARALLEL to the "indicators" folder. You do not compile the 3Color.mqh file. Rather, you compile the 3c_JurX.mt4 file, and it should compile if the 3Color.mqh file is in the proper directory. Now, how to use it... I'm not yet sure. It's the weekend, and feeds are down until tomorrow for me. I'll check it out then. Pips4life

--- 帖子 #388 ---
yup yup, how do i get it work? this 3Color.mqh and 3c_JurX? i got an error when compiling 3c_JurX. please someone? any ideas?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Yes sepak, I got errors too. When I looked at the source it looked like half of the indicator was loaded. I just deleted the whole thing since I do not have time to waste on flawed files. There's something missing. Instead I use Waddah's explosion or Waddah_trend. They both work OK and that's all that counts. Happy and profitable trading. BTW you can download 1000 indicators.zip from elcactus. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #390 ---
hm, ok Snobol. i'll try both. and thanks a lot and one more thing, do u use the default setting for these two waddah's indicator? does the default setting optimized for higher time frame like H1 and H4? or maybe someone with experience using waddah's indicator can share the best setting for H1 and H4 time frame. ok everyone, have a nice day.

Salam brother. I'm really happy with TSS now. Thanks to Snobol1 and others involved in. I'm dont believe i can trade forex so easy than ever before. Hopefully TSS will keep simple but smarter than other systems. Thanks God...

I am a bit too experienced to think that there is a perfect indicator. However, this is a good oscillator. I would suggest to use it in the following way: 1. I prefer to use the daily TF as it is less sensitive to interday news spikes 2. Take your trend decision from higher TF that is about 4-5 times longer. in my case I use the weekly chart to determine the trend. 3. in a weekly up trend - take only the buy signals from the daily chart 4. in a weekly down trend - only the sell signals from the daily chart. Make sure to have a reasonable exit strategy (I like to trail the daily price with 2 times ATR) Overall - nice oscillator I am not sure how better is it from other oscillators like %R and Elder Ray

I believe Uncle Sam tried to compile and got errors, however I do have it on my system, I'm just not sure what I did in the past to get it to work. I believe that if everyone can get this 3C_JurX indicator to work, it will be the only one they will really need to use with this system. Sorry for the problems, I was hoping if everyone pitched in, there would be a way to figure out how to get this to work for everyone. Thanks... M.

No sepak, I have not tried to optimize the settings for Waddah's indicators. I'll try that sometime. Cheers, Pip2

Hi marcf, why don't you post what you have that's working? When I looked at the source the main part of any mq4 indicator was missing. Somehow the file got corrupted and many people are wasting time with this thing that does not , and cannot work. If you need help as to what to do to get a file posted, I'd be happy to assist. But I don't want to bore you with details you might already know. So what say you? Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Well, the one I have on my computer is what is posted on here, so I don't really know what I did different. I guess so people don't waste their time, they can move on to another indicator that will help confirm the trades. The Waddah Explosion is an excellent one to work with. If there is anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish I had something more to give you that can help all of us, but at this point I don't. I do have the link as to where the indicators are, which I believe I posted before but here it is again. http://articles.mql4.com/310

Hi All, I struggled and made the 3c_JurX to work. It is just some modified MA based on the Jurx method that is plotted in multicolor to show the trend. However, there is another indicator called JurX_TrendSignal which also uses the Jurx method. It gives signals just like the TSS (instead of arrows it has some other symbol). But I think it is not worth wasting time. The signals were too similar. If you plot the OT3MA with 4,0.5 you will have the MA that will almost exactly match that of Jurx in its default setting! I checked both (Jurx default and OT3MA(4,0.5)) in 1H and 4H in EURJPYm and amazed at the closeness. Using similar signals to confirm a trend is wrong, I think. By the way, if you want to compile the 3c_JurX or the JurX_TrendSignal, just read the mq4 files. you can easily see that some fiile names are given at the beginning in English. Put the mqh files in "include" directory/folder and put the mq4 files in "indicators" folder (and compile the mq4 files). Then if you compile the 3c_Jurx or jurx_trendSignal, they will work. Both indicators need the four files: JurX.mq4 (compiled in "Indicators" folder) HeikenAshiR.mq4 (compiled in "Indicators") (I am not sure it is used) JurXSeries.mqh (in "Include") PriceSeries.mqh (in "Include") 3Color.mqh (needed for 3c_JurX). TrendSignal.mqh (needed for JurX_TrendSignal) I hope it clarifies all the problems. I took all the files from the Zip file from the metaquotes website address mentioned here. Again, you can see the extremely close MA just by using 4,0.5 in OT3MA. I am finding the TSS very useful. I think two time frames or two different settings and SAR (all already mentioned here) are good enough (or better than the JurX signals I checked). So, here is my addition. Cheers. chandra

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I have made the following changes to my version of TSS (I started with version 1.0 few days ago, understood each line; though have problem understanding iMAonArray in OT3MA even after reading metaquotes site). 1. Minimum change in MA to affect the Trend = 1 Point (may increase later). 2. Separated the email and Alarm functions (first when I disabled Alarm, emails did not work). 3. Email signals only after at least one-third of the BarTime is over (for example in 1H chart, it will not email any signal until 20 minutes in to the new bar; I have made it as an external variable and easy to change). 4. Calculate SAR and report that also in the email. The email will also show the time left in the current Bar. 5. Planning to add dual time frame report in email from single Indicator file. Also, planning to write an EA that can display these data on a single chart (without going through different charts at different timeframes; I should be able to see these data for two timeframes independant of the chart timeframe). For me it is easier to write an EA to display calculated data than to make it enter trades and manage them (at least now)! 6. Also, I think it will be better if we allow the price to breakout of the signal bar-range (I am thinking at least by 2 pips?). If we wait for such bar-breakout and SAR confirmation (along with higher time frame signal direction), the chances seem pretty good. (Also, as mentioned earlier, we should avoid trading in narrow range consolidations and wait for breakout). These are just my thoughts and preferences. So far testing only (not risked actual or demo money!). The point 6 above has a good summary of options I find interesting and useful. Cheers, chandra

Excellent work chandra, we thank you very much for taking the time to contribute to this project. If you don't mind, I will PM you my e-mail address so you could let me see those enhancements. I will also include them in the current version as a revision if you agree. I have been "massaging" the source too. I have included a pram to handle "weak" arrows. I have included "strength" as a param entered as points. If the peak which causes an arrow has slopes shallower than a certain value, in pips, an arrow is not drawn. That way "weak" arrows will not clutter the chart. You will note by the coding in the source, I am not a programmer, but I try to pretend! lol Feel free to clean up the source and maybe share your efforts with us. That would be super and we would be very thankful. All the best. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi simon, I don't think pairs matter as much as the TF you use. I feel that longer timeframes are better. One strategy I read on this thread earlier is that you look at a Weekly trend if it is up then you make only long trades on a daily chart. Seems to make sense because the trend is master in this game. Hope this helps, and we're glad you're interested. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #403 ---
To Marcf : Chandra is correct, to make the 3C_Jurx.mq4 run correctly in your computer, extract the files of include.zip in your include folder and extract the files of indicators.zip in your indicators folder. That should fix the problem. The 3C_Jurx needs these files : 1. In Include folder : JurXSeries.mqh, PriceSeries.mqh, and 3Color.mqh 2. In Indicators folder : 3C_JurX.mq4 itself (Of Course ), JurX.mq4, and HeikenAshi#.mq4 I am just reading the content of 3C_JurX.mq4 it self. Hope this helps !! Best Regards PS : I add Waddah Attar Explosion indicator and the screenshot of my chart after I put the 3C_Jurx &amp; Waddah_Attar_Explosion on it. Snobol, I am sorry if these stuffs made the TSS become not so simple as it was being developed, but I hope these files addressed the issue on things that we all discuss on recently posts. Thanks for your hard work to share with us !!!!

OK marcf, it does not make it any less simple. I tried the 3C_JURX stuff and gave up the first time. The second time I got them to work but their value is like a me2. A me too indicator like zillions out there. So unless you like grief and suffering, I would just forget about those indicators that do not work, or work just like the zillions out there. The basic strategy is to follow the trend. But what is the trend? Attach OT3MA and you've got as good a trend indicator as any. There are too many trend indicators that work properly to be fooling around with things that don't work. But to each his own. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Pip2, Thanks for your PM. I will be in touch. It looks like you have come to the same conclusion about the JurX as I did (That seems to be a confirmation singal that JurX does not add/filter anything!). I like all in one file (only TSS is the first indicator I use that has two files; I may copy the OT3MA part and put it into TSS to make a single file sometime). The JurX has about six files to do one job and I cannot understand the head or tail! If needed, I can duplicate the JurX indicator right from much simpler single file OT3MA. May be you can add some of the recent ideas about what can be used as filter in the first post as Additions. Such collection will give a better idea of what have been considered and seemed reasonable. I don't think we have to look for elsewhere. All the useful stuff are in this thread itself. I keep reading that this system is only for longer timeframes (daily and 4H). But as far I can see, there is no such limitation. Any timeframe seems to be OK with good filters (most filters already mentioned here; SL has to be managed according to timeframe as well). Of course I am looking at EURJPY. Thanks for sharing the system. chandra

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi Chandra: Thanks for your input in regards to the JurX. It doesn't add anything, however it does give a confirmation, in my opinion. I have used it all last week with good results. But, as the title to this thread is The Simple system, We certainly don't have to look anywhere else. If we all work together on this, we could have one great system on our hands, which I believe we already have. Thanks.. M.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
hello all, thanks for the TSS Team that have made a good system. I have a question,Snobol suggested that use 15,0.7 for the OT3MA as a visual filter for trends, then I tried to compare it with OT3MA 28,0.7. I found that using 28,0.7 was not bad,"it worked". so can I use OT3MA with 28,0.7? or I just follow default parameters of OT3MA (15,0.7)? sorry if I'm mistake.. thanks..

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Very good chandra, I will try to update the first post. It is not easy because the edit button has long gone. I have to go through a Moderator to attach new files but updating text I have not tried. Should be simple enough. Combining OT3MA and TSS has crossed my mind, but that's in the background for now. I have filtering by way of limiting slopes of peaks/valleys which make arrows. The tradeoff is that some good trades are also wiped out in the process. But the chart looks a lot cleaner after the filter is applied. I'll look out for your e-mail when you're ready. Keep up the good work. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi sennin, no mistake. That's the right spirit. Keep on trying different settings for OT3MA. Actually I use 15,0.8, it gives a slightly better fit. What I like is the smoothness of OT3MA. TRIX is another smooth indicator much like OT3MA, you should try it. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Pip2, I have sent my version to you just now. I just used your "Strength", but in a simple sense that I used before. Please have a look and see if anything is useful. chandra

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Marc, About the JurX being additional confirmation, as far as I checked, it did not filter bad signals (it seemed to filter good and bad to a similar extent and more than 90% of the signals were within 2 bars from TSS signal, independant of choppy or trending market; but I checked only in EURJPY). We can use similar confirmation without complicated systems by using the OT3MA itself. Thats what I mean when I say JurX did not add/filter anything (I meant that it does not add anything that cannot be done with OT3MA). JurX uses 5 or 6 files to do that job whereas in The Simple System, we can use just one file to do a similar job. Thats what is simplicity. But that is just my preference, and if it works for you thats fine too. Thats what counts in the end. We have to be comfortable with what we use. For many people (especially newbies), simplicity is most comfortable. chandra

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi Pip2, From the confirmation point, it looks like we will need the OT3MA separately and so there is no need to combine it into TSS, I think. Since I started that, I would like to record that now I have changed my mind! They can be (have to be) separate to work best. chandra

Of course...understood. Thanks for the input.... M.

Hi Snobol1 and other TSS Activists. Trading on the new upgrade seems to work well, I made another 75pips. I note that you’ll be updating the TSSv1 1 [2007 05 09] again. To this I also see you have a problem to revise the written part of the First thread. May be you should leave as is and only include a install/operation/strategy file in the Tss.zip file – that way we will be looking at the same procedure and anyone that contributes could then add or clarify within this file. That will be a great help and will ensure that one does not have to scan the whole thread to pick up loos ends. Hope I’m not asking too much PS: has anyone perhaps got a solution to my #376 Querry: “Looking for MT4 Chart package to download Good day All TSS members New TSS seems to work well - will submit my latest trade venture with results obtained. I decided to now test on H4 only. I'm looking for a MetaTrader 4 to download that reflects EST Time. Mine reflects GMT+7. I'm sited in GMT+6 and my broker is EST [FXSol]. This confuses me often. ” I’ll be much obliged. SA Greetings to all.

Hi Chandra, thanks for the update of what you have changed. My strength changes are almost identical to yours so I've decided to use your version since there are many more useful changes than mine. Am sure the users of the e-mail feature will have good use out of it. I changed the names back to the original form only to avoid confustion, everything else was left as you sent it. As far as TSS and OT3MA being separate indicators, if the two are saved as one template, it will be easy (simple) to attach them to a file when needed. So there's not much to be saved in time by combining them. All I can foresee is more problems de-bugging something that does not really have to be! Aubrey, good point, I can (and will) write an update in the zip folder in the readme file therein. So everything will be in one place. Why didn't I think of that? As far as your 376 query, I can't help directly, my broker's time is offset to my local time too. I made up a table with 2 columns, the left column is for Broker time (24 hr clock) and the right column is my time (am/pm). I never get confused because my time table is at my elbow at all times. Its a bit of a pain but it works. I decided to edit this post rather than post a new one. Something just came to mind. How about "CandleTime" program? If someone could make it display EST instead of countdown time to close of bar 0, that will solve your problem. The display of the time can be shifted so that it is in a convenient spot. The actual source for the CandleTime is very short, barely 20 lines of active code. Food for thought. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi Pip2, I am happy to hear that you liked my version. Please check if all the corrections used in version 1.1 are correct here. Also, you can make more parameters as "extern" variables so that anyone can change them differently for different charts, if they desire. I had reduced the number of such extern parameters/options (including ShowComment, Alarmset...). When I write the dual timeframe version, I will let you know (if you like that idea, we can make it for the next version). I plan to make it such that in one chart we can know the whole story (Signal and SAR of two or three timeframes, possibly for both email and the ShowComment function also). I also think Aubrey's idea of putting updated information in a readme file is easier than editing the first post repeatedly. But do we have to use the Zip format? May be a few individual normal files are ok (at least the readme file in normal form), because they are all so small (just a thought). chandra

Snobol and others, Here is a nice Clock indicator I have. Have a look at the picture and see if could be useful to you. the instructions are in the code, but here they are again for ease of use: // Instructions // BrokerTZ - Timezone of your Broker (in hours from GMT) // LocalTz - Your timezone in hours from GMT // DST - Is it daylight savings time? // ShowLocal - Set to tru to show your local time zone // corner - 0 = top left, 1 = top right, 2 = bottom left, 3 = bottom right // topOff - pixels from top to show the clock // labelColor- Color of label // clockColor- Color of clock Depending on your and brokers time zone their inputs can be either positive or negative. example broker is GMT+2, BrokerTZ would be 2.0, and if your local time zone was EST, LocalTZ would be -4.0.

Hi rideblitz That's quite a handy one you've compiled. Thanks - no more confusion.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Dear Snobol, Some questions to you : 1. Is it correct that to use OT3MA as a filter by look at the position of candle to OT3MA, means that, if the candle above the OT3MA, then we just ignore the Sell Arrow (Down Arrow) and trade only the BUY ARROW? and if the candle below the OT3MA, then we just ignore the BUY ARROW and Trade only the Sell Arrow? What if the arrow appear when the candle cross the OT3MA? 2. What is the exit strategy of this simple system? is it just CAR trade (CLOSE and REVERSE) when new arrow being appeared? 3. What do you think if using this indicator on H1 timeframe? as you just mention that it is meaningless to trade this indicator on 30 minutes and less? Which one is better, to trade it on H4 or D1? and what currencies? Thanks for confirming and forgive me if my questions make you disappointed, Cheers. Sangkil

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hello Chandra, in the spirit of keeping it simple I have avoided using too many externs. Too many params will cause too much confusion so I try to limit their number to a precious few necessary ones. I am testing your version now and so far it works OK. That dual TF version you mention is in the spirit of TSS. One indicator that's all, ok maybe just 2 indicators. Too many indicators could cause indicator fatigue as in other systems! Your idea sounds great and we will be thankful for it. I agree with you on the readme file but it is easier for me to just bundle everything together as one zip. The point is, however, it should be easy for users not me, so I'll see what I can do. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #428 ---
1. No, the OT3MA should be used as a trend indicator, so a candle crossing it is not really a trigger unless, ( read on). If the OT3MA shows a trend as DOWN then ignore all up arrows . If candles go up and penetrate OT3MA that's a pullback from a downward trend so its a trigger that a sell might be in order. OT3MA is for trend only. 2. Exit strategy is not yet defined but you can use a trailing stop or the reverse arrow or fixed TP. So you can use any exit you wish, there is no hard and fast rule. 3. Yes you can use it on H1 TF, even lower according to chandra. I have not tested it on lower TF's. Feel free to do so. TSSv1_2 has a strength filter which could be adjusted for weak arrows from param window. Maybe you should wait for version 1_2 before you test on lower TF's because you could end up with arrow fatigue!lol Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi Pip2, Good to know that there are no problems with my version. I also try to limit the extern variables. So, there is no problem. What I am planning to do is to calculate for two time frames for TSS and SAR only. TSS is the main signal and SAR is supportive signal. The timeframe should be modifiable and one can look for the higher one for Trend (for the higher timeframe SAR need not be considered; SAR should be considered mainly for the timeframe used for trading). The plan is to make a Table like the following (I am using underscore to align, but actually it will be spaces in the program). Other email information now used will also be there. If one chooses 1H timeframe in the Input (or chart), the report will look like this (along with some of the older info). I think that will be simple (but making will be little difficult, but once made, it will be very simple to follow; worth the trouble). The current arrows will not change, only the comments and emails will change (also the Strength which I am mentioning below). EURJPY___1H____ ____4H TSS &gt;&gt;__ BUY______ BUY SAR &gt;&gt;__ BUY______(sell) In addition, I am thinking that the Strength should be changed for different timeframes. 1 point for 1H and same for 1D looks not right. Some progressive points should be used I think. Please let me know about your thoughts. -chandra PS: It should be attached to the selected timeframe only; internal check will warn if they are not matching! Or we can force the attached timeframe to be the trading timeframe and do one more calculation above it. (Still plan only; but once planned all the logics, it will be quicker to write).

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Despite clear mention that TSS is good only for long timeframes, I first checked it in 5M chart (because I happened to work on that timeframe at that point!). It needed more confirmation than higher timeframe. Still it can be used in 5M, but it will not be so simple anymore (one has to look for trendline/resistance breaks, double top/bottom, cup-handle patterns, etc along with some other indicators and only during active times). I have not given up on that, but may use only sparingly. The 15M signal with 1H direction or 1H signal (better if it agrees with daily signal, but not necessarily) seems very good. I have not checked 4H chart and I think 1H-4H combo may be better. So far, I am planning to use only 15M or 1H as my trading timeframes. I am mostly considering only JPY related pairs, away from USD; but may checkout GBPUSD sometimes. In anytimeframe, it seems a very good indicator to follow the breakouts. If breakouts fail we will be out with reverse signal quickly for smaller loss. Otherwise, it can make good gains quickly. -chandra

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Here is a model email alert I have been working for TSS (the alignment is messed by FF formatting). I hope it will be useful. The same will be displayed in the chart also (without the two dashed lines and the last line). But sometimes it is difficult to see the comments in the chart (if prices are in the top-left corner). Also if any EA is there with comments, they will mess with each other. The following is an actual email I got. The higher timeframe shows the Trend for TSS (need not be a new signal). In Higher timeframes (1H and above), it seems to me that it is OK to go against SAR, but expectations should be low and exit strategy better defined. The comment on chart also will show the current trend for both timeframes (not just new signals). But the arrows work as originally designed by Pip2 (except the addition of Strength parameter). Hi Pip2, can we just double the Strength value for the higher timeframe? Or leave it as it is? -chandra

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi all, I have attached a SS of a USDCAD chart annotated to show pullbacks in a trend and the arrows to follow. Hope this answers some questions. Chandra, you have covered a lot of ground in your last posts: great! Right now I am still testing your version. I will test the e-mail feature even though I will not be using it. The strength looks at the slope of the peaks etc/\ . It becomes more critical on lower timeframes. One way is to set up a chart with one TF and massage the strength to suit your desire. Few arrows could mean missed opportunities more arrows mean weak arrows and poor performance. Between those two extremes there is a happy point!. When that happy point is found, make a template and just invoke whenever you want. Yes, the strength param will vary among TF/s. An automatic change in strength to compensate for TF could be built in , in the future. For now the template route seems to be the least painful. Using SAR as a confirming indicator could be useful but as always SAR in choppy short TF's gives reverse signals. I.e. buy instead of sell etc.. TSS like most other indicators works best in a trending market and a wide ranging market with short trends in between. I don't think its possible to cover every situation in the market, but 60 80 percent should amount to nice profits: (maybe?). Thanks chandra for your support. That's a nice clock rideblitz, I tried it out and it works OK. Now I know how to position text at any corner of the chart. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Thank you Snobol for giving clear chart to show how it best to use the OT3MA as a filter. I think wait for the version 1.2 is better idea. LOL Cheers, Sangkil

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Does anyone know how to add an alarm to a zigzag indicator? Dustin

--- 帖子 #435 ---
The only reason I am considering SAR is to use as SL and TS. Though it is not perfect, it gives some guidance and removes a big problem of deciding what SL/TS to use. If it is in the opposite side, we cannot use it for that purpose and so ended up calling it as a confirming indicator. Hope this explains the reason and purpose of SAR as I see it. As I have mentioned about short timeframes, the single statement summary I can make for that is: Shorter timeframes need more confirmations and Longer timeframes need less confirmations. The reason is that even though one can enter early in the trend using short timeframe, more than what was gained will be wiped out during sideways moves. Probably this is what it means when it is often mentioned that TSS is good only for longer timeframes (because there it will be really Simplest). No single method can cover all the market situations. The important thing is to survive incorrect situations while waiting for good ones (because we can never know where each entry will take) by keeping losses and losing trades to as low as possible. Pip2, The chart was great help (a picture is worth thousand words!). But how do you find a saturation point described in the chart? I hope you were able to check the email feature. Some Antivirus programs may create problem when the emails have same/similar heading all the time (which might be confused with worm activity). -chandra

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Chandra, I would say a "saturation point" is a point that has not been visited in over 20 YEARS. The USDCAD pair is now in that situation, you have to go back yo 1978 to see lower USD vs CAD. The Bush wars are bankrupting the country but many think the economy is just fine. Time will tell; it always does!! Yes the e-mail feature worked for me. I received the test e-mail OK but have not checked yet for alert e-mails. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #437 ---
TSSv1_2 has been sent to Antra and will be posted soon. I have not attached the readme file separately yet. E-mailing of Alerts works but I did not check to see if any of the information like entry price etc are correct. Am sure errors will surface if there are any. I have also enclosed the Clock utility in the zip folder for convenience. So one folder does it all! Cheers, Pip2

Just thought that I would put together a set of charts for the EUR and then follow along with the signals in each of three time frames and see what happens. I particularly like the look of the signals in the 4 hour timeframe, also suits my personal timeframe.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
The 1 hour timeframe also looks interesting. I am curious to see how signals here act as a lead in to the 4 hour timeframe signals. Anyway, those are my three favourite timeframes to trade with. Reading this thread has been a great inspiration. The combined cooperation, creativity, talent, problem solving and persistence deserves a pat on the back and a well deserved thank you! THANK YOU!!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Choppy price action seems to play havoc with the signals. Perhaps some of the most difficult type of price action for any system to accurately respond to.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi Marc, I have made another update where the Trend from next higher timeframe to the current chart will also be included in the Comment and email. The emails can be filterted by signal strength and slope (the slope will help avoid sideways market, default is no filter). I have sent it to Snobol. Since I keep my version somewhat different, he may take sometime and I hope eventually release a new update. Here is a sample of emails I am getting from my indicator. This is an example of a choppy market (with potential for reversal?). The slope is not filtered here. The higher timeframe is already defined for each chart timeframe.

Thanks for the feedback...How do you incorporate the signal strength and slope in regards to avoiding the choppy markets? Any help, would be much appreciated. What typically do you input for the slope, what do you look at?? Thanks so much.. M.

O.K.--- just fooling around with the indicators to get a set up that works for me: OT3MAV3 yellow 4,1.5 T3MA_mod_2 red 6,1.5 HMA%20modified blue, magenta hma8 T3MA_mod_2 green 21,0.7 Dynamic Zone RSI green,yellow 8,20,8 Stochastic dogerblue,dogerblue 5,3,3 When the OT3MAV3 "and" T3MA "and" HMA "and" RSI "and" Stochastic cross, only then does it seem like there is a chance for a high probability trade in your favour. If "any" one of the indicators contradicts then chances are much less likely that the trade will go in your favour. Look at the verical red lines on the chart and draw your own conclusions as to how well this approach works to filter the trades. An LRC channel is a great visual aid to help identify those all important support/resistance levels. My favourite trades are those that are likely to go across the channel with the LRC median being take profit areas as oppossed to entry areas. The red T3MA may have possibilities as a way to manage stop loss placement. I guess that a bit of forward testing is in order to prove(disprove) the worthiness of this approach. Your feedback is much appreciated.

The rectangular area highlighted in the above chart shows an area of whipsaw and false signals. How do we avoid those trades? 1st yellow arrow - no trade - no RSI cross 1st magenta arrow - no trade - no OT3 and T3MA cross 2nd yellow arrow - no trade - HMA is wrong colour 2nd magenta arrow - no trade -no OT3 and T3MA cross 3rd yellow arrow - no trade - no OT3 and T3MA cross Patience is definately a virtue in the game of Forex. I try to define my trade criteria and then patiently wait for the market to come to me (old stock market swing traders approach). NO! I am not that ancient, only like fine wine, well seasoned .

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Currently there are four recent arrows that have printed. The two yellow arrows are a no trade because the HMA is the wrong colour. The two magenta arrows are no trade because there is no OT3 and T3MA cross. Don't you absolutely love it when evaluating whether or not to take a trade is just that easy .

Hi Chandra, I have been trying this system but when I changed to another broker using its MT4 with different GMT, the TSS got errors when compiling and didn't work at all. After some trials, I download the most updated verison of MT4, the TTS works again. Perhaps the MT4 from that broker is outdated. Thanks for your concern and great work. MV

Hi All TSS'ers I've uploaded the latest update for the TSS Indicator. All seems to be OK but I do not get an Alarm when when the Arrows appear. Did I omit something? See setup attached. SA Greetings

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi there go to indicator list , select TSSv1_2 and edit , TAB "Inputs" , set the alarmset to true and set the alarm2Mail to false.. and you will have sound with the alert.... I had a same problem with you last time.. by the way , can you share your FF calender to me thanks Regards, Simon

Hi Marc, The following quote was mentioned by Snobol in an earlier post, but nothing much has been developed/standardized for this. "if the slope of the trend becomes too shallow, don't trade" The slope is just pips per bar the MA moves (50-LWMA used). I think at least 1 should be used, but it will depend on the pair and Timeframe . For example, 1 pip in GBPUSD is lot small compared to 1 pip in USDJPY. 1 pip average move in 4H is lot less compared to 1 pip average move in 1H. On average, 1 for 1H chart seems to be good as far as I checked EURJPY. For 4H chart, at least a double of that will be good. These are just to give some preliminary idea (in my latest version it will be used to reduce emails only). Further estimate of whether there is a trend (or wide enough range) will be needed before considering new position. Also, if the slope is increasing (say from 4 in previous bar to 5), it means uptrend is gaining momentum (and only up signals should be considered). If the slope is falling (say from -2 to -3), the good downtrend is in effect. On the otherhand, if the slope is weakening (from 3 to 2 or -3 to -2), it means the end of current Trend is near and either a consolidation or reversal is expected (one should use more caution). Signal strength is exactly similar to Slope, only difference is that it uses the slope of same MA used to generate the signal (by default 4,1.5). Unlike slope filter, this will stop the signal itself (along with email and alerts). Numbers similar to the slope filter should be OK here also. I hope this summarizes what I think about using the slope for evaluating the Trend. In addition, The OT3MA longer term trendline can also be used for the Trend direction, as described before. Similar trend strength evaluation can be applied there also. -chandra Addition: Also if the slope is moving opposite, one should be careful or avoid, I think. (if the slope is positive, use buy signals only; if it is negative, use sell signals only).

Hi, Can you post your T3MA_mod_2 and Dynamic Zone RSI MT4 Indicator? thanks regards, Simon

--- 帖子 #458 ---
As per request, indicators are attached. Enjoy.

Here are the other ones as well.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Sorry, attached wrong indicator on previous post. here is the one that was requested.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi All, I have found a better basic indicator than the T3MA series. I have not had time to read beyond P30 of the thread. So I don't know what is going on yet. As you kow my quest is endless. I have found a new indicator called FX_Fish... and when infused into TSS you get fewer false signals. My preliminary assessment is that it is far superior to the T3MA which gave too many arrows for my liking. I will attach the files to this post and if there is concensus, I will post them in the first post and supersede TSSv1_2. For all interested please test and report and compare. All other features of TSS are retained, e.g. alarm, e-mail etc. Cheers Pip2 Use at your own risk. Do not hold me responsible for excessive wealth.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Attached are the indicator FX FISH... and another sample of the output from FISHTSSv1_2/ Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #463 ---
hm... looking good! thanks snobol. will try it.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Probably best to take our time and forward test the Fish indicators because if I remember correctly, these indicators are noted for their re-painting characteristics. That generally means lots of false signals. Just my two pips worth.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
How can I unzip this file &amp; put it in Metatrader? thanks

--- 帖子 #466 ---
go to download program below and install it. http://filehippo.com/download_7-zip/ right click the zip file and extract to expert/indicator folder. hope this help

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I have loaded the indicator in to mt4 but when I load it on to a chart it does not show up on my screen.......but it is there because in the indicator list it is showing up. Can anyone help please Thanks

--- 帖子 #468 ---
while using the FISH TS ..it shows on the expert tab that _FISH.ex4 can't be opened

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Oops, I believe I did not attach the _FISH.mq4 file necessary to make it work. I will do that now so check in a bit and download _FISH.mq4 fron my post. Thanks for pointing this error out to me. That file is the indicator file I use in the TSS transfusion. I did that because the original file had too many parameters. The attached file _FISH must be in your indicators folder and compiled. FISHTSS should work ok. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Am not sure which file you are referring to, but FISHTSS is an Indicator not an expert advisor (EA). Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Thanks Snobol1. I am now trying the FISH_TSS. It seems to be working fine. Could you please refer to some information about the use of FX_FISH_2MA? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
thanks yes.. i'm talking about the missing _FISH ..thanks

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Ok, there are a lot of indicators in the last few posts, could someone sum up which indicators are to be used? Im counting 3 indicators named: FISH_TSSv1_2.mq4, _FISH.mq4 and FX_FISH_2MA.mq4. Am I correct when i assume that all three should be used intead of the original ones?? Could someone enlighten me? Thanks

--- 帖子 #474 ---
These fish based indicators are repainting very much.. As well as TSSfish.. just load them on 1 min chart and observe.. Sorry guys.. serggry

--- 帖子 #475 ---
yes better......

Hi Simon. Here is the FF cal attached. Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Snobol1 [Pip2] I'm little confused. Could you assit by posting us a picture of your Indicator setup presently. See my attempt attached. Thanks

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hello fellow TSSers Can someone verify the new indicator is a repainter. Or is it like the original? Thanks

--- 帖子 #479 ---
guys fish 11 is not repainting too much , can it be use ...

--- 帖子 #480 ---
for me it's repainting a lot. the last two bars... if you can wait to trigger the entry after two bars... is ok.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
The program that draws the signal arrows is the same we used before and it is not a repainting one (100% sure). Only a different indicator is used to make the signal decision (instead of OT3MA indicator, the FX_FISH Indiactor is used). The Indicator programs may calculate the past values differently than at first it was calculated and that will affect only past signals. Just now an arrow formed in EURUSD-1M at 14:38 GMT. It did not look promising, but if I followed, it could have made upto 10-spread in 5 minutes (I am not saying all the signals will be that promising!). There was no repainting whatsoever. This is to confirm further about some saying it was repainting in 1M chart. I am very impressed with this FISH. So far it looks to be a great catch during Pip2's week of vacation. Here is a comparison chart that has both OT3MA (old) and FISH (new) based signals. The old signals are smaller, closer to price candles and in Yellow and BlueViolet. The new signals are bigger, farther from candles and in Magenta and Green. There were 16 up and 16 down signals in old system. The new system has only 8 up and 8 down signals. Sometimes the new signals come 1 bar later, but the removal of such huge number of signals is extremely great. Let us all check it our more and develop this. -chandra PS: The chart is GBPJPY-15M (and has Pivot Levels and MAs)

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Just now when I was typing my previous post, the two signals in my chart disappeared. I had set the MaximumBars=20, so that I need to watch only a few signals for the repainting case. So, it looks like the signals beyond that MaximumBars limit will be removed, but not repainted. When I redrew the signals with higher limit, I noticed that the 14:38 GMT up signal had shifted to 14:37. Then another new down signal at 15:01 moved to 14:59 after resetting. I think this is the way the FISH calculates the old data and does not remove bad signals and current signals will be correct to use. I can see the bad signals, which never produced any gain at all, are still there. So, if you are using the arrows for visual backtesting, just consider that the actual real-time signal might have come later by a bar or two. The 15:01 signal (that moved to 14:59) would also have been correct if followed in real-time (another 10-spread). Then there was a third real-time up signal at 15:25 GMT. Which shifted to 15:24 and it would have been a loser. Then the fourth real-time down signal at 15:30 shifted to 15:29 and still continuing. The shifting occurs only when WE reset the Indicator (by going to Properties and clicking OK). If no resetting is done, no shifting of new signals happens. So, if you run the program for a week without any resetting or restarting the MT4, the signals you see after the first Insert of the Indicator (or last restart of MT4) all should be accurate real-time signals. Summary: 1. Repainting is not correct; only when redrawn, the calculations give a different results for the past data. Until redrawn/reset, no repainting. 2. Two realtime signals would have been profitable (in 1M chart!). 3. The signals are not too accurate for visual backtest (just shifting by about two bars to the right will be closer to reality). 4. No need to wait for two bars to enter. Just old rule can be followed (after the close of signal bar, my preference is for breakout from signal bar range). Looks very promising. May be we can test much more about the real-time signal results. -chandra Addition: A three signal set at real-time up-15:43, down-15:44, up-15:50 became a single signal after resetting the Indicator to be up-15:44. So, two signals indeed disppeared. But this was a low volume period and many minute bars were missing (may be no trades). But all would have been be OK if the signal bar breakout was used.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi Chandra This is my first post in this thread, but I have been following from the start. I'm not a repainting expert and therefore my questions. Do you think that the repainting will occur to the same extent on the higher time frames, i.e. 4 hour? Somewhere on another thread I have read that higher time frames might "solve" repainting problems. I want to test this system following the arrows, i.e. enter when get yellow and exit on pink or vice versa. Do you think this is worth while?

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi chandra , There is some thing wrong with the indi at 2000 fxdd time the arrow pointing up and once the fxfish 2ma cross the +0 line the arrow gone it suppose tobe stronger up arrow . and once the fxfish 2 ma cross-0 back down the arrow appear again . now the problem is at O crossing not repaint .

I have had a few PM's requesting a post of my previous template. Here it is. Make of it what you will and don't be afraid to post results, that is how these methodologies are developed to their best use.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi farimir, I have not checked it in longer timeframe. I checked it in 1-minute and currently checking 5-minute (both EURUSD). But as far as I can see, you can use the realtime signal. It seems that here the signal belongs to the previous completed bar. So, you can use it as soon as it appears. But I think we need some improvement on this signal. So, please wait. You can use it with care though. -chandra

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Cast, I am getting to the bottom of all the calculations. Here are what I have so far. (I will still follow each line and understand more thoroughly.) 1. The FISH uses the Highest and Lowest of last 10 bars and analyzes where the current price is compared to that range. It also adds previous bar's similar value to come up with the final value for the current bar. 2. It has its own Signal (it even includes entry/exit price, but not neat). 3. The entry signals need a threshold strength, not zero crossing. Zero crossings are used for exit only. I noticed that the FISH indicator itself had some strange "repainting" of recent 3 values for the Indicator Histogram. According to the Threshold setup, it would not affect the signals, but currently we are not using any threshold. That may be the problem. 4. So far I have not seen any difference between the two FISH files (_FISH and FX_FISH_2MA) and I think I will delete one. (already my Indicators folder is messy!) I think further changes/improvements will be along the way. -chandra

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi all, Though I got good realtime signals, after a long time to understand the program, I finally found that this program calculates the signals and Indicators from Right to Left. All the other Indicators I know calculate the values from Left to Right. I made it calculate from Left to Right.* Also, I found a corrected version. They are not as good. Their signals are somewhat delayed and many are false too. Now I can clearly understand why the signals of the recent past change when the Indicator is reset/restarted. Because there can be new 10 bars High-Low range for the recent few bars (as per my earlier post, this number is important and the current price is compared with this range to calculate the Indicator value). But still I think it is a wondeful system. Based on my realtime signal observations (in 1-min and 5-min), it was great so far. We cannot use the signals for backtest. We have to do only forward testing. -chandra Addition: When I made the program calculate from Left to Right, I did not change anything else (so does the program I found in Forex-TSD). But I think such simple change will give wrong results (as they did). The calculation is little more complicated. I may try further to understand the complication and see if it is possible to straighten it correctly. Otherwise, just use the realtime signals. No need to sit and watch though. We can let the program run for a few days and then check the new signals that came after we started (ignoring the older ones) and see how they could have turned out. Also, using a Threshold will not solve the problem. That is not relevant (since I considered that).

OK here is some information regarding the Fish indicator. FISHTSSv1_2.mq4 is a hybrid of TSS and uses the Fish indicator instead of OT3MA to place arrows. FISHTSS indicator uses _FISH.mq4 as its basic indicator which MUST be in your indicators folder and compiled. FX_FISH_2MA.mq4 is the virgin file and can be used as is. It works well. It operates on the last TWO bars BAR 0 AND BAR 1. This is not a problem and is NOT repainting. The last bar bar 0 is in a state of flux gentlemen. Especially those who are looking at one minute charts. What's next one second charts, then one microsecond charts! Give me a break. For those who want bar 0 to stand still, find another thread that can accomodate you. Others who are more reasonanle, read on. In the FX_FISH_2MA file I posted, I have removed 2 other MA's which confuse a good indicator. As posted, the colours are for a black background screen. When the indicator crosses from &lt; 0 to &gt; 0 its a buy signal etc. Now if you add Bollinger you will note that when the bands close up, its getting close to a breakout up or down. Look at FISH while the bands are narrow, if FISH is neg sell if pos buy in the channel. I am now trying this in an EA that a member of this thread has sent and it looks good. I have only tried this indicator in the M30 D1 range. As always the shorter TF's have too much random variation. It is interesting to see the indicator at work in an EA set to visual mode. To summarise:- FX_FISH_2MA.mq4 is the original, slightly modified. _FISH.mq4 is the same file as above with external parameters removed. Used in the indicator below. FISHTSSv1_2 is TSSv1_2 using the _FISH indicator to draw the arrows. The first file FX_FISH_2MA may be used alone. Buy and sell at indicator transitions -/+ or +/-. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #491 ---
You guys are awesome! I am so sorry I can't contribute any at the moment. I hope I can be helpful after some more trials. BTW, I find the MA1 &amp; MA2 are invisible (black) in FX_FISH_2MA. Are they made as such on purpose?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I only comfortable with daily and 4 hour chart with TSS ...... one min and 5 min is too short.... as i'm going for at least 25 pips.. cos the broker i'm using has 11 spread but the pips price is better than other brokers.

only use the crossing of the fisher , thats why some guys said it repaint , but itis not only when the fish reject the 0 line then the arrow is painting . the problem I see to day is a bug before it cross there is arrow pointing in the right direction when the fish cross at the same right direction the arrow dissepiered . hope these help

Hi Chandra, thanks for all your efforts. You are a real hero, and you have advanced the art of Forex. Step by step we progress. Yes: _FISH and FX_FISH_2MA are identical ( almost). _FISH was made to work with TSS in that the extern parameters were changed to "internal". That was to make calling the FX_FISH indicator easier. Functionally the files are identical. I have since found out that by changing the "period" parameter to 15 or 20 gives better signals for entry/exit. I have also added a threshold parameter to the Fish indicator only in my algorithm for an EA. Backtests are super, but of course, that means nothing. Next week I will forward test on a demo. The algotithm I use in the EA is also simple, but it need not be that way. If Fish is above zero AND above my optimized threshold Buy. If below zero etc... So far with the back tester set at Feb 12 to April something, on the EURJPY H1 it took 5k to 96k with almost no drawdown. I'll attach the tester screenshot. I think too much time is being wasted on arrows and repainting. Arrows are just a convenience for manual trading with alerts. Fish does not repaint. If one calls the action of Bar 0 repainting, then every bloddy indicator repaints. That's ridiculous. If bar 0 forms a part of the calculation of any indicator then the result of that calculation will reflect the changes. If Bar 0 and Bar 1 are part of the calculation, then they will change the results at Bar 0 and Bar 1. If the result is in the form of an arrow IT WILL CHANGE, PERIOD. This is NOT repainting. Repainting, as I understand it is when an indicator goes back to previously recorded data and change something to correspond to a better fit. If you want an indicator that really repaints try "Cycle Bar". I hope this puts repainting to rest forever. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hlo snobol1 ,I only try to joint in to test run the system and the indikator no more no less , fish indi has been very populer with it behavior and yet there is still alot strategy using it . Any indi has O cross always tend to repaint if what it call ,even super trend signal can be trade able . I am not talking of the arrow paint or repaint or the fish paint or repaint what I see is there is an arrow pointing up before fish cross cross +0 when the fish cross +0 the arrow dissepiered and price keep on making HI and Hier ,so I thing it maight be a bug or some thing else so I told chandra , like to know if it and error or bug. Ok lets put all of +- O as the nature of fish and go forward to the better of strategy and the system . Cheers

--- 帖子 #500 ---
OK Cast, I posted the FISHTSS for testing and the results are coming in. Like TSS, FISHTSS uses the fish indicator to draw arrows. But it can be used by itself with good results. If there is a problem with FISHTSS we must look at the Fish indicator. I am backtesting it right now (in an EA) and will forward test when the market opens. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Great snobol1 , Looking forward to hear the good news . cheers

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hi Pip2, I was the one who posted some realtime 1-min signal observations. I made some observations that it could have made great trades, but my goal was just to observe the behavior of the Indicator. I forgot to mention that though I was noting down actual 1-M signal results, my intention was not to use this (or any other) indicator in 1-min chart (my timeframes are 5,15,60-min, with 15-min being favorite). I think others who mentioned 1-min chart also used only for observation purposes and not for performance testing. As I had mentioned, the past signals cannot be used for backtesting and realtime signals seem to be great. That is due to the problem of back calculation, not exactly repainting. This understanding had been reached by somebody some 18 month earlier too! (I had a beautiful chart to show the differences, but my computer crashed/died and I lost it). However, I do have a problem. Pip2 can you clarify? As far as I understand the code, the signal is supposed to belong to the previous completed bar and so it should not change depending on the changes of current bar. May be I am missing something here (that is the nature of FISH?). I am excited to hear about EA being tested. Are we moving to next level?! I will look forward to seeing the test summary. At least for analyzing the performace, I would like to see a backtest run with fixed lot though. I was starting to apply dual timeframe info to this and could not finish. -chandra [Since my computer is having serious problem, until it is fully fixed I will have limited access. Since it is under warranty I think it should not take too long. ]

--- 帖子 #503 ---
OK Chandra, good work, I hope your computer problems are sorted out soon. I don't know which is worse, a sick computer or a sick wife! lol As long as people recognise the "noise" on shorter TF's its OK to test there. Yes, it appears that both bar 0 and bar 1 are simultaneously being redrawn. The greatest effect is on bar 0 of course, with bar 1 being less so. It is interesting to note the action of Fish indicator when backtested in visual mode. You can see the histogram forming and trades being placed according to the level of the histogram. Yes, am moving slowly to auto tradind because I am too nervous to trade manually. I make big gains manually, only to make big losses soon after. Using Fish in my algorithm with an optimizable threshold yields good results in backtest. In visual mode it seems all the right entries and exits are OK. If I can duplicate that in some forward tests in a demo next week, I'll be singing!! So right now it all depends of forward tests. If proved useful, I will post only as an ex4 file since the "parent"EA is copyrighted and I would not like anyone to mess with the source. The params should be enough to keep the fingerpoken crowd happy. lol Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi Pip2, I am also interested in Auto Trading. Because the programs can trade without fear/greed, strictly checking/following all the rules and can work 24 hours a day (or the time ranges provided). I will not complain if only the executable is made available. The "Parameters" tab options should be great enough for checking various choices. But I think we should be careful about testing or optimizing using past data. I am convinced that this indicator is not to be used on past data; I have checked 1, 5, 15-min charts. The past real time signals can never be reproduced fully; when trending is good, there will not be any problem, but many choppy time signals will be missed and that will skew the results (may be we can call this indicator extra-ordinary, special, complicated or something else). So, we have to give more importance to the forward test results. My computer problem has been traced to a dead memory module and it is going fine with half memory (it is going to work on half memory for a week as per the service people schedule). But it is working now! I will try to get a picture again showing the problem of using it on the past data in a 15 min chart (but the code does not distinguish the data based on timeframes and so it should be applicable to all timeframes). I want to stress that I am convinced with the good quality of realtime signals. I have seen some wrong signals also (which disappeared on resetting) and still it is way better than all others I have seen (so far). -chandra

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi Pip2, I have a question. With the original system (before Fish) I believe you were using the OT3MA 15 as a filter - you preferred to enter Long trades only if the OT3MA 15 was heading upwards, and vice versa. I have noticed with the Fish indicator, the Fish arrows seem to almost always appear in the opposite direction to the OT3MA 15, so whenever the Fish gives an up arrow the OT3MA 15 is heading downwards. I know the recent change to the Fish indicator is of course resulting in a move away from the original OT3MA signals, but I find it interesting that the new indicator seems to be providing entry signals that are exactly opposite to the original system's intentions! Am I correct, or missing something? Regardless, the new system seems very good and I look forward to forward testing. Are you still using any other filters, eg. Stoch? Regards, Jin

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi Pip2, Eagerly waiting for your fine tuned system rules.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi, been following this thread for sum time now and it seems to me that there is so many varients of indicators which is starting to make things more complicated rather than simple. It would be both helpful if we could list the most recent indicators used with this system. One more thing, how do you make the arrows smaller/bigger? Regards

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hi Snobal and everyone, thanks for this system. I had a peek a few weeks ago and tried the template but there were too many false signals. However the new fish indicators seem fantastic! Anyway will be testing over the next few days. Wanted to share something in return so please have a look at this useful EA for manual order management from TSD :- http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...anagement.html Thanks again, and I look forward to testing an EA if you post one for trial. Cheers, Cal

Just to say that I'm also very excited about the new indicator. I'm forward testing on 4H chart. Just frustrated with today being so quiet.

FISH performs in exactly the same way as Solar Winds and both indicators mirror each other, only SW does not have the MA lines.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I don't know why someone gave a new name for Fisher Transform method. But the basic equations and a different method of usage can be found in the following link: http://www.linnsoft.com/tour/techind/fish.htm -chandra

--- 帖子 #512 ---
This is about the Fisher Transform method (whether the Indicator is called Fish or SolarWind, that does not matter). Since currently we are checking it very eagerly, I thought the details will be good to know. Here is the type of chart I have been mentioning. It is a 15M chart of EURJPY. It shows the various stages/ways of Fisher Indicator. There are four Indicators plotted and I am describing them below: (please ignore the arrows, they were redrawn during a resetting). 1. The Fish Indicator as we are using now (without resetting/redrawing). The last two bars do change, but if the price move has any strength, the change will be immaterial and will not affect the signal. 2. The RAW Fish Indicator with no smoothing (I cut the smoothing factors). This data never changes and past is fully reliable. But it is most choppy than all others. But you can see that the current form realtime chart we are using (without resetting) still resembles this fairly close. 3. The Fish Smoothed using past data. This data also never changes and the past is as reliable as real time data. But it has a lag of about 3-4 bars. (though I can make this indicator, I used one from Internet; http://www.forex-tsd.com/metatrader-...fisher-11.html scroll to post:106 or 109 for the source code). 4. The Fish Smoothed with future data (redrawn and so it has used the data of future bars but in real time that data will not be available). This is what we will get when we look at past chart. You can see that the zero crossings are few bars earlier than it will be in realtime (1) and it suppresses some crossings due to smoothing (both of which will lead to wrong estimate for past performance). After this thorough analysis, I am still convinced that it is a great indicator. May be divergence will work here also. I think any of the first three ways can be used. The first and second ways do look quite similar and first is less choppy. So, the Indicator we are using currently comes out at the top, but it cannot be used for backtesting purposes. The second way will be more accurate for backtests, but will produce some choppy trades and ruin the results. The third method can also be used, but our entries will be always delayed (like most other indicators, there will be a lag; but still good for safe entries). May be in the past people ran away from this Indicator just by seeing the past data differing from realtime data and assuming it is worthless 'repainter' (or EAs and manual methods optimized using the past data performed horribly in forward tests). -chandra

Great work Chandra we all thank you. I have not spent much more time on the Fish indicator. Other homely matters have taken precedence, so you are quite welcome to expand on the usage of Fish indicator. To Jin in post 505, no, I have not experienced counter arrows between OT3MA arrows and Fish arrows.. Both sets of arrows always seem to complement each other. Its quite possible that on a short TF say M15, a "noise" arrow will contradict Fish arrow. Am just guessing. For those who might be confused about the introduction of Fish, let me say that there was only one indicator in TSS, and that was OT3MA. OT3MA was used as the basic indicator to draw the arrows for convenience. And a longer period OT3MA was used as a Trend indicator. That's it. Now I have been experimenting with Fish indicator to draw the arrows, because it seems to give fewer false signals due to "noise" i.e. random variations in price and not trend variations in price. So its just two indicators, use one or the other, not both. I hope this will clear all "confusion". Cheers, Pip2

thanks you guys for all the hardwork. i am an admirer for Fish as well. BTW there are so many fish indicator, which is the latest and non-lagging and non-repaint version? i understand that this method cant used as back testing, but i backtested it with UJ from jan 06-may07 and it sort of earning 100 - 1100 pips monthly . so how was the future/current testing? how much pip it can earn in a month?

Hi Cast, Here is the Fisher-m11.mq4 file. It does the calculation from left to right and never changes the values. what you see in the past histogram is as good as realtime. But there is a lag of about 3-4 bars. I found that this program can also do the calculations without the smoothing (just by changing the Parameters option for the two smoothing values to zero; if I knew it, I could have saved some time trying to make that separately). As mentioned, when used without smoothing, the lag is reduced, but more noise will appear. It looks to me that the Fisher Indicator needs a balance between three things. Smoothing (to reduce Noise or False signals) and Lag (third being ability to use on past data). So, the best balance is what we are currently using. Because: if we use past data for smoothing, we are late to the party. If we don't use smoothing, we will see whipsaws too often. By using this form we are losing the ability to use on past data. But we want what is best for the future/present not best for the past (unless we are planning to go there!). Cast, I have added only the following to my chart (which was attached in my earlier post). You can easily add them. 1. 10-EMA (Close) 2. NonLagMA (defaults) (File attached) (it's color shows the trend) 3. 50-LWMA (Close) 4. SAR (Default) -chandra

Hi Woopypooky, our current version of Fish indicator (may be the oldest) is the best and please don't use it for backtesting, for reasons I mentioned in my earlier post. You can find what we are using in post 469 or 461. We don't have any test record, because we incorporated it in the TSS signal system only about a week back. For us the advantage seems to be that we are able to reduce false signals. For example in EURJPY-15M, from yesterday 0 GMT to today 17 GMT there were 22 signals in our old TSS and using FISHTSS it would have been only 16 (saving from 6 choppy moves). Thats all we are after (getting good signals and less noise). This system can send emails and MT4 can send emails only. if you want sms, you may have to setup some service that will convert emails to sms (since I was interested in this, I have checked before and none seems to be free, though sms to email can be free). -chandra

chandra these is what i am see ing right now ..... any idea ?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi Cast, Everything seems right to me. Have you attached both TSS-OT3MA and TSS-FISH versions? Because I see two types of arrows. But at the bottom you have two FISH indicators that are identical, may be one is enough (but I am surprised they show difference in the last two bars, I have to check out; Checked out! Conclusion: may be you attached them at different times. So you can remove one). As you can see, if you used (or waited for) both signals or one signal and NonLagMA direction, then you would have been correct most of the times shown in the chart (may be except monday). Because they are not matching with the bottom Fish Histograms, I think the arrows are real time signals (not back calculated signals during a reset). Snobol1 wrote: But for me it seems that if they agree (or if NonLagMA agrees) then the chances seem better than any one signal alone (one can easily check in your chart example). Most of the time they come together, but sometimes they are not, which seems to help in reducing the whipsaws. We have to consider that the signals just represent a start of a Trend/Move direction. Until opposite signal appears, the prior signal Direction stays in effect. Correction: I am using NonLagMA set to 50 period for 15M-EURJPY and 5M-EURJPY. Other currencies and timeframes may need a different period. -chandra

I just wanted to let everyone know that the following are approximately equal (very close). The OT3MA can be used as a substitute! OT3MA(4,0.5) = JurX(5) [complicated installation: see post 399] OT3MA(10,0.6)= NonLagMA(50) OT3MA(10,0.7)= NonLagMA(40) OT3MA(4,0.8) = NonLagMA(10) -chandra

1. Chandra, do you mean the latest indicator we should use is the one which Snobol has named it : Fish_TSSv1_2? 2. May I know how the best way to use this indicator? enter after the next opening candle after the candle with the arrow? I am a little bit sketch as after I change the TF and switch back, there are some arrows that move their positions before I switch the TF? 3. Do we still use this indicator on TF 1 Hour and above? if so, then why on the above post you use it with 15 minutes TF? 4. If may, do you mind if I want to know from your experience, what is the best time frame for each currency? (for example, what is the best time frame to using it on GBP/USD, or what is the best Time Frame for EUR/JPY and etc). Thank you for your attention. Regards. Sangkil

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi all, I'm posting two charts which display Fish_TSSv1_2 and FX_FISH_2MA. It happens to be a 5-minute chart for GBPUSD. The short timeframe is just for testing this indicator's behavior. Observations: 1. There are two examples of wrong way Arrows on the chart! According to the system, down-arrows occur when the FX_FISH_2MA crosses from above zero to below zero, and up-arrows occur when crossing from below zero to above. In the chart, you can see that there were two places where near-crossings occurred but did not happen. Furthermore, if there had been actual crossings, there should have been BOTH arrows occuring close to each other (presumably 1-bar apart). Instead, only one arrow occurred by each near-crossing, and those two arrows are ultimately the wrong direction. FYI, popup alerts corresponding to these wrong-direction arrows also occurred. The second redrawn-chart makes these wrong direction arrows disappear. 2. As others have noted, whenever charts are redrawn, real-time arrows which did not accurately predict market action disappear. Those real-time arrows which ultimately were correct shift backwards in time, making them appear to have been much better signals that actually occurred real-time. My attachments only show an example of an arrow shifting. However, it is easy to find other examples of real-time arrows disappearing upon redraw if the price went against the arrow. The reason is because the calculations take into effect FUTURE bars when deciding whether and where to place arrows. There might be good reasons to do this, to preserve the best real-time arrows possible (is this really true???), but the method is completely useless for looking at historical arrows in the past. More comments to follow, but here's the first chart:

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Here's the same chart redrawn. The two wrong-way arrows are gone. The one real-arrow (down) has shifted backwards in time. The FX_FISH_2MA bars have been smoothed, so there's no more near-crossing at all, only small inflections in the directions.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hi Sangkil, 1. You can use either TSSv1_2 or Fish_TSSv1_2 (or can use both; as far as I have checked, that seemed better, which I wrote in my earlier post). 2. My preference has been to enter in the next bar, AFTER its range is broken in the signal direction by at least 2 pips. In addition, one can use SAR and NonLagMA(50) direction for confirmation (even considering MACD(10,20,4) direction). 3. The original creator of this thread Snobol1 meant this system to be used on 4H charts mainly (daily and 1H were also considered OK). Timeframe for any method depends on two things. A. how long you are going to be watching (shorter time = Longer timeframe) B. how much movement is there (low move period = long timeframe) {C. also depends on maximum Risk on each trade (low=low timeframe), but whipsaws can cost more often} So based on these one has to choose the time frame. I like 15-min and at active times 5-min (such as, just after news). 4. Best TIMEs for any pair is the one of the currency country is in trading session (if both are in session, better). So, for EURUSD and GBPUSD, the european session time of 7 GMT to 16 GMT will be good; for USA people 8-12 EST will be best). In such fairly active times, 15-min timeframe is good, but one has to stay around and work (be very careful at news times; better to stay out or go to shorter timeframes and avoid trading during higher spreads /spikes). If one wants to trade less often, then hourly is next good thing. As the timeframe increases, the stoploss will also have to increase. In choppy times (like most of recent EURJPY), that can be a killer. In that case one has to move to higher or lower timeframe where reasonable patterns or tradable moves can be seen (at least in the recent past or wait for breakouts). -chandra BEST Setup = Breakout; The Bestest! = Breakout Fails And Reverses.

Hi Snobol1, Chandra, others, I've been following this thread from the very beginning, and I've learned a lot about working with MT4 and the various indicators. Like Snobol1, I don't care about which indicator to use, so long as it's successful at predicting market action correctly more often than it's wrong. The best thing going for this thread is the high-quality of people following it, especially those who are capable programmers who can fix the bugs or add enhancements. As for myself, I'm technical but not a programmer, so I think I can help best by testing and by offering suggestions. For those of us who've followed this from the beginning, we saw potential in the MT3MA based TSS indicator, but there were a few too many false arrows. However, supplemented with additional indicators like Stoch and RSI and others mentioned, one could manually weed out many of the false arrows. Now the new TSS direction is to use the FX_FISH_2MA indicator, and it shows some promise. Chandra has done a lot to compare various versions, and he and others think it is still a useful tool. However, what I'm feeling is a little frustration with this new indicator. (PLEASE understand I only desire to offer helpful and constructive comments, not worthless criticism or negative crap which helps no one). With the older TSS/MT3MA, I felt that I could look at chart history and know that the arrows that are there are pretty much where they would have occurred in real-time. Yes, there may also have been a few additional real-time arrows which might have blinked on/off/on/off during some particular bar(s), but when the bar was done, you either had an arrow or not, and you could trade based on the Open of the bar following the Arrow. It was VERY helpful to be able to review a whole month of chart history with the arrows and other supplemental indicators to mentally walk forward, bar-by-bar, and see whether I could accurately predict the very next bar before I saw it, based on all the signals, not just TSS/MT3MA. But now with this new FX_FISH_2MA based indicator, it's no longer possible to do this review of chart history. The FISH Arrows get placed further back in time, by 2+ bars, based on FUTURE chart action. One cannot just review the history and see an Arrow, and say to oneself, do I believe this Arrow will happen as it says, or not? The reason is of course the Arrow will be right, because it's only there BECAUSE it turns out right! Though I try to keep my computer running with lots of charts open, sometimes it reboots automatically, such as with Windows XP updates, or if MT4 hangs, I might have to restart it. If that happens, then I lose all the real-time arrows that are the only way to know if this FISH indicator is any good. Another big drawback is that I'd really like to be able to change the timeframe on any chart from H4 to something else, like Weekly, or H1 or M30, and then change it back to H4 -- but I can't because if I do, I'll lose the real-time arrows! Instead, I'm forced to open another window and use that window to check the action, and when I do so, the history-arrows will be near useless. Only real-time arrows from that moment forward will be valid and helpful. Because I'm monitoring 12 major pairs on H4 charts, even with two monitors I just don't have a lot of screen space to open a bunch more Daily/H1/M30/... charts. It's really a drag not to be able to use my existing windows for any timeframe because of how the arrows change for historical data. Is it really that difficult to change the FX_FISH_2MA code so that the historical arrows would be the same as real-time arrows? Can the current indicator be modified ( or "fixed" as some might say) so that it does NOT take into account any "future" price action to decide whether to place an arrow or not? It seems to me if you're dealing with historical data, you step forward bar-by-bar, and what you know is the past, and for the current bar, you know the high/low/open/close. (You shouldn't even have a clue about future bars for this method to be valid). For what I'm calling the "current bar" as you are stepping through historical data, you don't know the order of price action for the current bar, but you know the limits. There are two possible orders for price action for the current bar that one could consider: Open-&gt;High-&gt;Low-&gt;Close Open-&gt;Low-&gt;High-&gt;Close That's it. Nothing else really matters. So, given ONLY that past chart history, could one do the calculations about arrows based on the 4 prices above occurring with either of the two above orders? Based on that, you know exactly one of the following for every bar in the chart: 1. No arrow would have occurred... 2. Or, a momentary arrow would have occurrred during the bar, but by the bar close, it would be gone. (I previously suggested to put a triangle or another kind of marker there to indicate this false kind of marker because it is helpful to know it would have occurred during a bar, even for historical data). 3. Or, a permanent arrow would have occurred, so you put it on the chart over THAT bar, never over a previous bar. I talked about using Triangles and Arrows both in a previous post (#258), and the idea still has merit but I have no skills to actually program this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=258 Would it be possible to modify FX_FISH_2MA so that the historical data is completely valid, and the arrows on the chart occur where they would have occurred during real-time action, rather than moving them back several bars as the current version does? I'm still very interested in this thread, and am thankful for all the many helpful people out there working together on this. Thanks for reading my comments... Your thoughts and responses are welcome. Pips4life

i understand that the fish repaints itself if u close and restart MT4. any chance somebody here got subscribe tick data ? it would be easier and faster if we can use tick data for past candles to backtesting.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Chandra: Does this Fisher-m11 repaint? Once a bar closes, it will remain as it is, no change? Any feedback, would be much appreciated. Thanks... Marc

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi Pips4life, Thank you for the nice comments and the details of the problem. I also understand the frustration of not being able to quickly test how it will work with various choices (such as additional indicators). But nothing can be done about that. As I mentioned before, there is the choppy Raw Fisher data. If we use that, it will give way too many false signals. If we smooth with past data it adds about two bar delay (from no-smoothing, upto four bars from future-smoothed data). fisher-m11 can do the no-smoothing and past-data-smoothing. [Hi marcf, fisher-m11 never repaints and can be used on past and present data without any difference; once the bar is closed it is fixed. whatever result you got from past will work for future also; it is just like most common indicators and comes with lag] If we smooth with future data, it cuts the delay (actually gives earlier signal, but that will change if the move did not materialize; consider it as a confirmation-check). As I mentioned before, if the move had any strength, there will be no repainting at all or the repainting will not change the signal sign/direction. The best way to test is to use a short timeframe (during active period) and sit. Thats why I have tested it in 1,5,15 minutes (not in 1h or 4h). I see NO reason for it to behave differently in different timeframes. So, what we see in lower timeframe will be applicable in higher timeframe. Note on OLD TSS (OT3MA-based): We had more wrong signals on the old system. The choice was reducing wrong signals and reducing lag. We cannot reduce both (this is universal for any system and any market). So, Snobol1 settled on a middle ground using OT3MA(4,1.5). For those who don't mind a little lag, the second parameter 1.5 can be reduced. I found that reducing it to 1.2 reduced some false signals without adding too much lag (0-1 bar lag mostly). But I have decided to leave it at 1.5 with the idea that I will not consider the signal as an entry point. I will consider those signals only as a point of interest. The earlier, the better (so I will have more time to verify with other indicators or pairs or timeframes to confirm). I consider the Fish signal also same way (and so I prefer the earlier signals produced by future-based smoothing even if it does not help in backtest). -chandra

--- 帖子 #532 ---
For those who wish to backtest the FISH indicator, the best approximation I can suggest is to use the Fisher-m11 indicator with 0.4, 0.3 as the two smoothing values. This is the best compromise between Lag and Choppiness I can see. It will be 100% applicable for past data also. -chandra

--- 帖子 #533 ---
i can see that the fish_m11 lagged a few bars behind the original fx-fish. even if backtest is reliable, there is just to many losses. fish_m11 cant catch the trend here, if we buy at second green bar, it is already to late for most cases.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
If it was too late after just two bars, I think the market/pair chosen was not in a good stage. The best way to use this (or any trend following system) is to select a pair that is in a good trending or broad ranging mode. Until such a market is found, it is better not to use any trend following system (means staying away). I have come to a conclusion that I want to check the major pairs at least once a day to see in what mode they are in. Then, instead of struggling with the same pair all the time, I can change as the choices appear. Pips4life mentioned that he was watching 12 pairs. I think it will be better to check their mode and select a few to be watched (thats what I am wishing). But the problem is how to determine the mode the pairs are in, especially quantitatively and as early as possible. If we can do that, we can call 'the search is over'. I have read many threads and there are plenty of thoughts. It will be difficult for me to check too many ideas (I get lost easily in the jungle of ideas). I will post the ideas I have saved and everyone can check them (See the next post). They are old posts, but good to refresh. -chandra

Hi All, The following are the posts I have collected regarding one of the two most important aspects of trading (1. A System and 2. Proper Market for that system). I am just pasting what I have saved as a text file. Please feel free to check and choose any of these to be used with our signals as per your preference and post information that can be useful for others. Though multi-timeframe signals will reduce the false signals, it is best to start with a proper market/pair. Because our signals do not filter out sideways market and almost always there is a signal. It will be true to any trend following system and always some filters are used to reduce noise. But if we filter the market/pair first, then less filters will be needed at the time of signals. We had some filter suggestions here also before. This only adds more confusion or choices! But, I believe that always after muddling, we can get a better choice than looking with limited ideas. -chandra =============QUOTES================== Thruline (Forex-tsd: 11-Feb-2006) Time of day and time frame. That's how you beat noise. Trade the higher volume times and look for trends on various time frames--the latter sometimes means going up in time frame, but more often, down in time frame. ========================================= iGoR: your problem is as old as the stock markets started... if you can find an indicator that tells you the difference between a ranging and a trend market (wich is not lagging or AFTER the facts) you will become a billionare.... ==================================== Devil2000: Sideway market is about 70% of the time, at least we can filter it more. ==================================== phoenix: try smma(16) and an envelopes of smma(16) + set the deviation to fit each pair work best in H1 scale ========================================= eventtrading: Bollinger Bands Were designed specifically for this issue. ========================================= juanchoc: The best way to filter sideways moves is to filter hours depending on the pair you are trading and drawing horizontal lines to make static channels. At least that works for me. Most moves start at news time, acording to the pair you are trading, and when price moves outside its range you've got a trend... You could use a simple oscillator to define entry points, stochastic maybe... ========================================= sfxtrader: Trendlines, candle patterns, and knowing what time of day to trade is all you need. Everything else is just painting a pretty picture of what has already happened. If you've mastered a few simple candle patterns and manage your money well (i.e. small stop, bigger TP), you're fine. You don't NEED any other indicator in the world. ========================================== fxnewbie: I just have an idea, but skilled people can develop better. How about to identify choppy markets using good old bollinger bands?. Lets say identify sepatation values between upper and lower band that match with the "sideways" criteria. In that way, everytime BB reach those values, EA can identify them and not trade. When BB widens above those values, EA can be active again. ------------- banzai: I think they called it Bollinger Band Squeeze. ==========================================

how's that EA working out with forward testing? Any updates on it would be great. Thanks,

Hi all, Chandra, once again I have to thank you for your contributions to this thread, Pips4life, great work you have done, sorry for my long absence. I stumbled on the Fish indicators which seemed good for TSS, but if it is found to repaint then into the dustbin it goes. Pis4life, in your tests with Fish historical, do you have a way of verifying that data before and after (disappearing arrows) are the same? I believe all indicators are passive in that if wrong data are provided wrong results will result. So until you could verify that the data have not changed, Fish ( and any other indicators) will respond to what is presented as "data". Arrows certainly give one a go, no go, situation. I am not trying to defend Fish or TSS, far from it. If something does not work, toss it and move on to something hopefully better. On that score I think contributors to this thread have done a wonderful job of advancing the art of trading fx. I have not tested the fish version of TSS to the extent that Pips4life has. I posted the Fish alternate to OT3MA because I thought it was a step in the right direction. I have noticed that Fish operates on both bar1 and bar0 the current bar, and have also noticed a disappearing arrow (at bar 0) even on H1 TF. That's to be expected. On shorter TF say M5 FishTSS is more reliable in that there are fewer noise arrows. So I say, keep on testing and eventually come up with something better. The advantage of an arrow indicator is that you need not have any indicators on a chart but the TSS insicator will "read" its "called" indicators and display the result in the form of an arrow, instead of trying to squint to read and decypher 2 or 3 wiggly lines! Cheers, Pip2

Hi All I enjoy this thread very much and is more or less refreshing this page all day to not miss a new post. I would like to trade a system like this, so hopefully one of you will get this indicator working. I wish I could contribute more, but I can't program etc. I just want to add an indicator that I'm 100% sure doesn't repaint and gives fairly good buy and sell signals. I do noy know on what the buy and sell signals are based, but a programmer might figure that out. If i'm going off the topic then please ignore my post, but I'm posting this as it seems that we are still investigating indicators to base the buy and sell signals on. Hope I make sense.

Thanks brother, i love to try.. will post the result soon..

--- 帖子 #540 ---
what values you suggest for this indicator

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi Snobol1, Thanks but I don't deserve much credit. Others, like Chandra, are doing a lot more actual testing than I am. I'll remind you that I'm still a beginner at Forex and MT4, so I still have plenty to learn. If I give suggestions that are just flat out wrong, please don't hesitate to correct me. Last week I made posts about a couple of topics. The first was to say the current indicator has some problems with wrong-way arrows. If you display the raw FX_FISH_2MA data, you can tell these are bad arrows because they're occurring at times where no actual zero-crossing occur. This bug should be fixed, especially since it may interfere with an EA. Getting a wrong-way arrow would be quite bad for automatic trading. My second topic was about my frustration with not being able to redraw or change timeframes back-and-forth because it moves the arrows back in time, or if they were "bad" arrows, it eliminated them entirely. I still wish the behavior of this indicator were different, and I remain hopeful it can be improved but the programming is beyond me. Having said that, I did run my twelve H4 charts from Tues-Fri, and then I reviewed the arrows. I didn't redraw, so I think the arrows were still in the position they had occurred in real-time. If I had traded those arrows, even some that were many bars old, I saw that two of the charts would have probably been bad results with some losses, but the other 10 could easily have resulted in gains of: +20, +45, +50, +60, +80, +100, +100, +100, +100, and finally +160 (USDCAD, which has been on an almost relently downtrend for weeks). I asked myself, WHAT was I complaining about??! This week, I've been demo trading the H4 arrows, and though they don't happen very often, I've seen more success than failures. So, I do think this FISH indicator deserves more time to fully check it out. Regarding your comment about throwing repainting indicators into the dustbin, I'm all in favor of that, HOWEVER, I don't think FISH is exactly a repainting indicator. Maybe I don't understand the definition, but what I *think* repainting means is that without doing a redraw, an indicator will change the chart (auto-redraw) and move even very old arrows/lines/histograms around to perfectly fit the data. This would indeed be a worthless indicator if that were the case. Other than Bar0 arrows which may blink on/off/on/off, which is fine and to be expected, I have never seen older data change BY ITSELF. Rather, FISH is what I'll call a perfect-hindsight indicator, which is that if you start it fresh, or if you do a complete Redraw or change Timeframes (e.g. H4-&gt;H1-&gt;H4), then indeed, the arrows do move, sometimes substantially. I saw one example of an up-arrow 4 bars back which upon a redraw moved to 16 bars back ( a change of -12 bars!!). This was because those -12 bars were relatively flat. Let's give FISH some more time. I'm also in favor of checking out other indicators in parallel as well. I'd also like to know if the EA has been put to the test and what are the results. Can anyone post the EA so more people can try it? (Does the wrong-way arrow bug interfere with the EA? If so, that bug must be fixed). It seems to me that the Fisher transform may well have merit, but the first indicators used methods of perfect-hindsight to adjust the history data. Because of this, it may well be that people abandoned those past indicators. Maybe, however, that was throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. The transform may well be good, but it just needs a fresh attempt at recoding it without the perfect-hindsight aspect. If I were to describe a perfect TSS indicator, it would do: 1. Upon a fresh start or redraw, the arrows occur at exactly the same place they would have for real-time data. No arrows get shifted backwards in time, nor do they disappear if they turn out "bad". 2. Though not required, it would be helpful if a different marker could indicator that during a particular bar, a blinking on/off arrow had occurred but by bar close, it was gone. 3. An arrow is place only above/below Bar0 (the current bar) which formed that arrow. An arrow is never placed at Bar1 or farther back in time. 4. All arrows are determined by history price action and Bar0 action. As you process a stream of historical data, you NEVER should consider "future" price action to determine whether to draw an arrow. As this is exactly what true real-time action does, I see no reason to do anything different for historical data. For every bar, since what you know if OHLC data but not the actual order, then the code may consider two possibilities as to whether an arrow would have been formed. Consider open-&gt;high-&gt;low-&gt;close, and consider also open-&gt;low-&gt;high-&gt;close. If either of these were to cause an arrow, indicate this on the chart, either as an arrow, or as another kind of symbol (a triangle, or different style arrow, whatever...). Bottom line: NEVER consider future data when calculating historical arrows. 5. Fix the current FISH bug with wrong-way arrows. We did have some programmers following this thread in the past, and if any are still reading this, are you interested to work with this FISH indicator to improve it? Thanks for reading this long post... Pips4life

Hi All I use the default settings on PerkyASCTrend on higher time frames (1H and above). Please note that I do not trade with this indicator as with all of these things they give too many false signals. But the signals are generally quite good although they lag a bit. I posted this as maybe this can help with the development of the Simple System and not as a replacement of the indicators developed so far in this thread. I enjoyed the FISH version very much although it was repainting (very dissapointed when I found this out). Anyway, just my 2 cents worth. PS The PerkyASCTrend indicator was part of FXOvereasy system.

Very well Pips4life, I have noticed that when Fish exceeds the upper or lower limit of its window, the whole display moves up or down. With that movement comes a change in the relationship between the zero line and the indicator. Its a subtle change, no more than half a period most times. But if the price uptrend is so great that Fish tops out considerably, the change could be enough to affect the next bar. When that happens, an arrow might move. Since arrows appear at zero crossings the likelihood of them changing is even greater. One solution I think is to enlarge the Fish separate window by increasing its upper and lower limits in the software. Enlarging by dragging the mouse will not work, that's merely a physical snlargement. We need a computational enlargement of the scale. If you change a TF, on a chart, or change then return to a chart, you might find the arrows changed because arrows appear at zero crossings and the zero crossings have changed due to Fish being topped/bottomed out. I will try changing the U/L bounds to see if it helps. I like your approach to this Pips4life. Its only by rigorous testing and a no-compromise attitude to results, will we attain success. I have also noticed "rogue" arrows when changing TF's, all I do is refresh the chart and they're gone. In any case rogue arrows should not affect an EA because the entry exit algorithm just looks at the action at bar 0 and or bar 1. Jam has sent me a FISHTSS EA which I am now testing. Backtests look OK, but forward tests are what count and am doing that now. So by Friday I should be able to post something. I will post on the first post in a separate zip folder. Both TSS and FISHTSS will be available. I think Fish is the way to go right now, until something better comes along. Cheers, Pip2

Having read the whole thread, I really appreciate the effort involved to develope this indicator. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif However, my vacuously depleted cranial cavity went into information overload. No amount of caffein or aspirin can relieve that kind of stress http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif . This leaves my highly developed brain stem under extreme duress http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif . It is amazing that I was able to even install the 3 Fishes (_Fish, Fish_TSSv!1_2, &amp; FX_Fish_2MA) http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif . Now, somewhere I read to add Bollinger Bands and the ZeroLag_MACD. The inputs for the 3 fishes came already installed. My question is, "What inputs should I use for the Bollinger Bands and the ZeroLagMACD? Additionally, two of the fishes installed histograms, both of which seem to me to show exactly the same information. Do I need both histograms showing on the limited area of the chart window? So far, I have just wound up squooshing (I think that is a technical term) one of them to be able to get a better view of the candlesticks. I would really rather have the real estate back to make more room. Thank you very much. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

I have sent a new zip folder to be posted by Antra this minute. It has an EA written by "jam" and algorithm by me, which does not use the Fish indicator. Use at your own risk. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Done!!!!

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Thanks Antra, well done! Attached is a backtest of my algorithm for GBPJPY pair. For those who believe in backtests, the modelling quality is 90% using non-Alpari data. I don't fully believe in backtests, so the coming week will be pivotal in the life of this EA. Try it, use it test it at your own risk! Cheers, Pip2 PS. I've added a chart showing the various points on the chart for buying or selling. No indicators are used.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Here is my test report on GBP/JPY for the same period. Something is wrong, but I have no idea. Someone please have a look.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Backtests using InterbankFX and other broker data are oftentimes completely unreliable. I can't count the number of EAs that I've backtested with extremely positive results which have ended up busting the demo account when forward testing. Forward test this week and draw your own conclusions. By the way, I do use InterbankFX as my primary broker for trading.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Your problem might be in the settings. I just checked them against mine attached and there are some different ones in there. Try those new settings and choose "Every Tick..." as the model on the tester. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi Jam, I guess there are not too many believers in backtests. I've tested some EA's which LOST money but still showed a modelling quality of 90%. It never seems to deviate too much, its either 90% or 50% with nothing in between. Totally unreliable I think, but that's all we have. Forward tests are the way to go but very time-consuming. You'll notice that I injected my algorithm in your FishTSS "shell". This coming week I'll be forward testing it. I've decided to try non-indicator type logic for a change, lets hope the backtests are worth something after all. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Snobol1, There appears to be something either inherently wrong with the backtesting facility, or it is something data-related, although only the programmers of the MT4 software may be able to answer that. Perhaps future releases of MT4 will address any deficiencies...time will tell. Right now forward testing, no matter how time-consuming and tedious, is the best we have. Jam

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi, Snobol1 My settings are the same as those in your test report. The key difference is that there are numerous small losing trades on March 29 and March 30 and the account is blowed. I changed settings to the new ones in your screen shot but the results are the same. Even before those small loses, the account balance is down to 8000 (initially 10000). I do not understand the new algorithsm. FISH_TSSv1_2 looks very good in my daily charts. Sometime the arrows do disappear even after the bar is closed, however the idea is to wait 2 more days to confirm. In a trending market, 2 more days is nothing, and you may get better price on the pullback.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi Pip2, The modelling quality just shows the quality of the data you are using. It has nothing to do with what EA is used. If you have 1-min data for the whole test period, the quality will be 90% (my guess is that if you have tick data for whole period, it should be close to 100). If you have lower quality data for some of the periods (meaning higher timeframe data which is lower quality for testing purposes), then the quality will come down. When we use longer timeframes in EA and bigger SL and TP, the minute data are very reliable for backtests (they are not reliable for tiny profit scalpers). But we don't know the spread changes that could have triggered wrong buy/sell/close. Other than that it is fine and the results are reliable. First thing we have to check is to see if the EA has entered orders as plannned to avoid any mistakes. Then, if an EA shows losses on 90% modelling quality, it is highly possible that the method is not good (at least for the test period market condition). For me, the important things to analyze are: Win%, Average gains, average losses, Max absolute Drawdown, profit factor, etc. If you can post the test summary, I can check it (the graph's are not useful). I have checked so many EAs from last November and wasted a lot of time (and thrown all). -chandra

Hi all, I am still around, though I didn't post much. Though it looks like we are moving away from Fish, I have been getting to the bottom of the Fish. I read John Ehler's articles and found out the full equations and basic idea/logic. But I am not able to find who was the original author that wrote the wrong version of Fish that calculates from right to left (the one we have). Though it gives early signals and it is possible someone did it on purpose. But I am suspecting somebody took a model indicator file that was calculating right to left (for most indicators, the calculations can be done in either direction) and applied the Fisher equation there without understanding the direction difference and the nature of Fisher transform . This is seen from the fact that the Fish's own entry-exit signals go from right to left (enter today and close it yesterday!!!). My conclusion (for now): Somebody did a poor job and wasted lots of hours/days for lots of people. Based on these facts I am convinced that the Fisher-m11 is the correct way and it comes with a delay. I was happy with Fisher because unlike most other methods it did not use any MA. So I thought it will complement the OT3MA method and together they will be great. At present, the best I can think is to use Fisher-m11 with zero smoothing (of course we will get choppy signals and filter it somehow). This is in case we are going to use Fisher any further. I was very pleased with the wrong Fish's live performance and even tried some explanation. But after understanding the problem, I have decided not to use the flawed verison, unless someone explains the logic of using future data for smoothing (otherwise it will be like building a dream house on a bad/no foundation). If we use Fisher-m11 at default, it causes delay. At zero smoothing, it leads to choppy signals. So, it does not help anything. Either we have delay or whipsaws, just like most common indicators (such as even the simplest MA). Smoothing factors of 0.2 and 0.1 looked reasonable compromise. Still some filter will be needed. If I cannot find a good filter, I may stop using any Fisher at all. Just wanted to update my stand on the Fisher indicator, because I wrote about it earlier. -chandra

Hi Chandra et al, very good work, and I am guilty at jumping onto an un-researched indicator and getting all excited. I don't have the materials to properly research the Fish indicator. So am not even going to try. For now I have moved away from indicators totally. There are so many of them doing the same thing, trying to predict the future with past data. And all of them fail because we are still not rich. I have posted some results of my tests with a non-indicator algorithm which seems good on the tester if you believe the tester. The algorithm seeks a low or high and takes a position for the retrace. Certainly not a new idea, but I came up with it myself. Though I suspect someone has devised a similar algorithm somewhere. If not? What d'ya know, I invented something.lol Are we deviating from TSS, no, not really. Don't forget its a simple system. So anything simple to the user, and that WORKS, i.e makes money, is part of the simple system. I don't like cluttered charts, unless, of course, the clutter is just profits! Take a look at the attachment, and later I'll post the EA that produced it. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hello Snobol, Ive been following TSS for awhile now...I just tried the EA on a demo account and it hasnt been making any trades. Are there any settings I need to change from the defaults? I see you were using GBPUSD right? At what time frame was this workign for you? 15m 30m etc? Thanks, -Matt

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Great Matt, I have been using H1 for all my tests. See the files posted below. The zip file has 4 files a settings file an ex4 a FishTSS and a readme file. The FishTSS was sent in by Jam, a contributor and I added the algorithm to buy/sell without indicators. The EA should wait until a top or bottom is established and a retracement starts then it will take a position. So be patient, it will take a few hours on a one hour chart. I have not tried lower TF's, so that means you can do so and report back. Hope you have good luck with it. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Snobol, is the EA posted in post 558 the same one you are talking about in post 556?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi Pip2, I checked the files and the results are the best I have ever seen. But I have difficulty getting same backtest results. For example, the best Profit Factor I got was 7.4, win ratio was 85% and my total trades were only 20 (you had them as 18.5, 93% and 46 trades). This is after I ran the optimization of the parameters which took about 100 minutes (which were very close to those in the .set file you have given). Still impressive results for a low drawdown. But my number of trades were so less. I checked the code and still I don't find anything that could have affected my results (The code is amazingly simple; perfectly fits The Simple System). Any pointer will be greatly helpful. Thanks. chandra

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Yes. I am talking about FishTSS but with my new algorithm. Chandra, I posted a statement for the GBPUSD pair hope that is helpful Last night (Sunday night EST), I attached that EA to several charts, this Monday afternoon, 3 pm the USDJPY was +13p the AUDUSD up +12p the EURUSD down -3p. other charts had no trades. I have attached the zip folder again so that there will be no confusion as to what I am writing about. I use one HOUR charts, but it should work on a 15 min chart too. The AUDUSD is 15min, all others are one hour. Chandra, thanks for the info about the tester, I always though that 90% modelling quality meant just that, modelling of the EA against applied data. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Chandra, I don't know what to say. Yes the optimisation takes a long time. Basically I optimize all parameters except "Lots" so it chugs away and I do other things while the optimizer works. I have no explanation for the difference and am certainly not padding the results in any way. I leave Lots at .5. If you use the .set parameters I have included, and use the time period I have used the results should be identical, if your data are identical to mine. As an experiment I will try to send you my "History" and you could test it against those data to see if that's where the difference lies. Beyond that am stumped. I too, thought the results were too good to be true but also note, I have tested other pairs which were NFG . That's no F.. Good, lol. GBPUSD gave the best results with the EURO not far behind. Drawdowns in all cases were minimal or zero. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I have put this in my expert adviser file. But the little hat is gray and it should be blue. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi Pip2, Thank you for the system. I can check with your History files. I think for this type of trades, the data will not be generally that different. But worth to check it. I think, if I can get same number of trades, the results should be similar. So, I am mostly puzzled by less than half of the trades I had. If it gave similar results for another pair, that is a good thing (shows this is not just coincidence). Backtesting on longer period of time and forward testing should confirm the results (even part of the performance will be extremely great). -chandra

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hi Snobol1, Chandra, all, Newbie that I am, I've never backtested before (but I will!). However, in researching it, I've come across some documents that could be helpful. Check out the Yahoo Metatrader group email file collection at: http://www.forexmt4.com -&gt; _MT4_Tutorials -&gt; ... There are several documents on backtesting, as well as plenty of other useful MT4 training documents. One has the enticing title, "Backtesting with 99 percent modelling V1.doc". Besides the tutorials folder, there are also indicators, EA's, scripts, etc. So much I've barely scratched the surface... I also found another document elsewhere I'll upload here. Perhaps there may be some tips that will help improve backtesting accuracy. pips4life

--- 帖子 #566 ---
One more thing about backtesting... The documents I've glanced at talk about importing M1 data (or raw tick data is better). You then use Period_Converter script to create longer time period charts, like M15 or H1(M60) or H4(M240) using multipliers. However, if two people use different MT4 brokers, the "0:00" time may differ. Some use true GMT, others use London, others use EST, and so on. If, for example, Snobol1 and Chandra use brokers with a 1-hour offset difference, then the candles for M15 and H1(M60) *should* still be nearly the same, however any time period above H1 (e.g. H4) may have a different starting time for the candle period. The H4 candles may look different because of the 1,2, or 3 hour offset. I came across a periodcon_v1p5.mq4 indicator which includes a time-offset feature so in theory, one should be able to create H4 bars that match what another broker uses. For usage, please read the notes in the indicator. It's kind of tricky... pips4life

Hi Snobol1, I tried to test the EA and attached it on Sunday, but it opened multiple positions at once on the same currency and blew my account (demo fortunately). Any idea what happened? By the way, thatnks for your work on this. Paul.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Have the indicators changed since thread one?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi Paul, I haven't a clue as to what went wrong. If you tried it on the GBPUSD and used the .set files I included you should have some nice demo profits. If you tried on another pair, you will have to first optimize for a period say Mar 07 to June 07 or something like that. I have the "Lots" set at .5 and optimized for .5. If you use larger lots you're on your own. I typically use 5K for my demo and 0.5 for Lots. I know some people use a million dollar demo account which is absolutely ridiculous. Also all my testing has been on the one hour TF H1. You must optimize before testing. Thats all I can say. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Yeah, it opened and closed multiple orders on me also. Took 8 trades in less than 2 minutes and luckily I was watching and deleted the EA before it cleaned out my account. This EA is definately corrupted. It took 200$ from my live acct before I got it shut off. Gos to show you u should test it on demo. Bad mistake on my part.

Any new EA should be backtested for many hours to test and optimize, and then forward tested on several demo accounts with many odd and unusual parameters selected. If people start loosing their money on this new EA posted in a public forum it will be their own fault from now on. They have been warned. I appreciate the release of the EA with the source code. Thanks. We can all play with the code to fix the problems that show up. In backtesting the EA shows the repeated trade problem more often as you increase the amount of history tested. For example one of the PDFs below is an optimized EURUSD daily backtest for 4 months that looks good. As soon as you add another 1 - 14 months of history to the beginning or end of the good test period the problem will show up. For some reason once the EA begins to rapidly open and close trades it can't correct itself. In the example below the same EURUSD daily with 2 weeks added gets stuck in the loop. See the 4 months + 2 weeks file. The problem can occur on the most recent week or several months ago. After 4 days of tests the the EA made at least a small profit over a few months on just about every time frame if the error was avoided. If the glitch can be fixed the EA will merit further forward tests.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
I don't see why this EA was opening multiple positions. The code opens orders only after checking if the total existing order is zero for the Symbol. If the total orders for the symbol is other than zero, no order will be opened. Even if the EA was attached to several charts of same symbol that seems impossible (as per the code). So, it is difficult to understand how that happened. I have checked backtest and running forward test and never seen more than one order at a time. The only problem I can see with this EA is that it will not open new positions if there was a position on the same Symbol (no matter who opened it, another EA or manually) and more importantly, it will apply its rules of closing and TS for any open order present for that symbol! So it is more cofusing to me how this EA was able to open more than one position at the same time. Only one possibility I can think of is that it might have happened during highly active period, where the execution of orders were delayed by several ticks and the program did not see the earlier order filled, and continued to place new orders until some filled order showed up in the Open Positions list. All EAs do the work at every tick (unless specifically designed to work differently). This is just a possibility, but never has happened to me with this or any other EA (in demo or live). Opening, closing and then opening is a different problem. That can happen. This EA uses two different strategies for calculating Buy and Sell (just this morning I wrote to Pip2 about it). Surprisingly (or not), at some point both conditions may be met (it looks like according to nvwine's example it happened on 01-Feb-07, on daily chart of EURUSDm; I did not even think such possibility, but now understand that it is possible!). Since the BUY order is first in the code, always it will open Buy positions and stop the calculations. Then at next tick, the checking part of the code will see the Sell signal and close the opposite position and we go in that again and again. I think this must be it. For any EA (even if paid a lot), the proper order of use is: backtest, forward test and slowly increase the lots (micro, mini, standard). Just my opinion. -chandra

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Thanks for writing Pip2. It may just need a simple repair. I would like to stress that considering the quality of backtesting, the problem may not show up for everyone on Feb 01. For the tests in the PDFs I used history data from a live account collected from forward running. As I said before I did get the problem to repeat on almost all tests if I increased the testing period enough. On some of the other tests I had to import data so - I'm sure we all know the validity issues. I'm convinced that it could happen going forward if the conditions are right. Although it could take quite a while. After a closer look at the statement mry2001 attached in post#548 it shows the same problem. The test is progressing normally until March 29th. The first time I looked at the report I failed to think about the increased spread on GBPJPY which is the basic size of the loses.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi nvwine, If it was the above problem as I think, the following changes to the code should correct it. (Pip2 will be working on it, this is possibly a quick fix). if( BuySig != 0 ) // old line 101 if( SellSig != 0 ) // old line 110 change them to : if (BuySig != 0 &amp;&amp; SellSig ==0) // new line 101 if (SellSig != 0 &amp;&amp; BuySig == 0) // new line 110 (or one can use the file I am attaching, which has only these two corrections done) Then run the backtest for the same period that gave problem. If you (or anyone) can report back here whether this stopped the problem or not that will be useful (I don't seem to have the data for this). -chandra (usually I dont look at zip files, so I did not read the previous report by mry2001)

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi all, I have not yet experienced any of those difficulties which makes the problem, if there is one, to solve. Now I have never gotten around to testing with over 0.5 lots. And I always optimize ALL read that ALL parameters at one time. Sure it takes longer but optimizing 1 or 2 or 3 parameters at a time is NOT the same as optimizing all together. Is that the problem? I don't know yet. The "core logic" seems to operate ok for me. If not Jam could intercede and fix things for us if indeed it needs fixing. Chandra I sent you an e-mail re buy/sell algorithm. As planned, the buy and sell algorithms are identical except for the &lt; and&gt; expressions which are necessary in ANY logic equation. Now the parameters are something different. Some parameters are in pips and others in bars. Take a look at my explanation of how it works in a previous post (547). Correct parameters are a must and it seems that not all pairs give as good results as GBPUSD. As a result I do not even test weak performers. All pairs are not created equal and this algorithm surely points that out. To those who tested on a live account without proper demo testing I say. what's next? Would you drive a new car WITHOUT BRAKES!!! Its insane! Give me a break. As Chandra said, and as all prudent investors know, backtest first, then forward test on demo, then go live with a micro account, then mini then full-blown. Its like teaching a child to walk, baby steps first with help and gradually progress to walking then running then flying then... Like I said before, use at your own risk. I've attached a Terminal shot of my trades on a demo account and so far no probs and it looks pretty good. I've used the comment "BARS ONLY" to identify those trades. As far as opening and closing multiple orders I cannot see how my buy/sell algorithm can trigger that. Chandra says that a delay in confirmation of a buy might cause a sell to be triggered. I cannot see that happening, because for a buy a bottom must appear and for a sell a top must exist, I don't think a bottom AND a top can exist at the same ( or nearly the same) time. Maybe am wrong, so I'll keep testing. The 2 losing positions are from another EA am testing. It does not use stops(bad idea) and you can see the effect on the account. That -800 is now over -1000! That's why I demo trade for testing. Cheers Pip2

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I used your modified EA and it was a big improvement. Both of the attached backtests would not even have worked before. The EURO has the exact same parameters as the former backtests I posted. This time it did not have 14 pages of small loses even though it was for more weeks. There does still seem to be a slight problem. If you look at the reports there are a few examples on each pair where it opened and closed multiple trades in a minute. I no longer know if this will show up in forward tests or if it is a real problem. Unusual things happen in back tests. Thanks for your work on this. A note to others forward testing the EA: Follow the time frames recommended by the developers of the EA to start with. Don't follow my time frames or currency pairs. They may be poor performing combinations. I try to optimize the settings for a lot of currency pairs on many different time frames. Then I compare the results and start several forward tests. Both of the attached tests are probably over optimized to the last 2 month's curve.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi Pip2, I did not say the second order will be a sell. It will be the repeat of whatever order was placed before (most likely a Buy because that comes first in the code). I think it is possible for a price to meet buy and sell conditions when different parameters are used as we do here. A down-move (or down-correction) with recovery (a buy signal), can be viewed as a down-move and correction (a sell signal), even with same parameters (but with same parameters it will be only one or other at any point even if it exchanges by one or two pip moves). But with different parameters the possibility of overlap of opposite signals becomes real. It seems my fix has reduced the problem drastically as nvwine has reported. A few repeat orders are still there, I don't know what caused those. May be that will need the observation of it happening in realtime along with the circumstances. -chandra

--- 帖子 #580 ---
OK Chandra, I misquoted you. I think if conditions are set up for a buy, a buy will occur on the tick that caused it, but if conditions to buy are still there on the next tick then another buy ( or sell) could happen. I think that is what was going on. With Chandra's fix (thank you) when once a buy is triggered, ( i.e. buysig=1) another buy or sell is inhibited. Somehow I have not experienced this at all, so I have no experience with it. I backtested Chandra's fix on GBPUSD H1 and got the same results as before. So the fix was not detrimental to the overall operation of the EA. I don't think there is any EA out there with absolutely no problems. So please don't expect the perfect EA to appear anywhere anytime soon. I think all EA's are a work in progress and improvements could come at any time. On this thread, at least, constructive criticisms are welcome and are productive. Jam, Chandra, Isto, Oleg77,and others have made this thread a good one to learn and contribute and above all get rich!lol. A word about Time Periods. If you change the time period e.g. from 1 month to 2 months you MUST re-optimize and update the set file. Failure to do so will result in unpredictable results. If done on a live account you will lose your shirt, and maybe your pants too. Please don't lament poor performance if you have not optimized for the TF and period you are testing. Optimize ALL parameters at one time, because even though the B/S algorithms are the same, their parameters are not! Happy testing. Cheers, Pip2

Hi GoldDigger I like to try out the indicator SimpleV8. I only have a problem - I need to change the color to fit to my chart background as black or dark backgrounds tend to make me neurotic. See insert. I tried to change it but it changes back to the yellow automatically. I do not seem to be able to open the programmed portion where one can change the color settings

--- 帖子 #582 ---
New revision SimpleV8.2, you can change your own Color and additional filter .

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Sir, I cannot load simpleV8 to chart. How to make its .mq4 file ?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Try this one

--- 帖子 #585 ---
maybe this can help to test the EA. Here is an interesting article here... a new way of developing and testing EA's... http://articles.mql4.com/303

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Have loaded simplev8 on to my MT4 chart but cannot see any buy or sell signals. Do I need to do something else?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I am unable to download the attach files containing the indicators. Can anyone tell me how to do it?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
What files do you want? Here is the revision to FISHTSS by jam. The previous bug has been fixed, no more multiple positions opened. If you have been following this thread, you will have the required indicators in the correct folders to make TSS work. If this EA works out the way it should, I will post it in the first post. Use at your own risk. Cheers Pip2 PS. Revision of sell threshold changed to negative value. The previous positive "selthr" was not correct. Please take note.

If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. There could be several reasons why your post was not acknowledged. Contributors have been very generous with their time and knowledge FOR FREE! Sorry we have disappointed you but with an attitude like that no one will progress very far. This is a free Forum, and results are NOT guaranteed. But with the pooled resources of contributors we progress. If you have a specific question, it may have already been answered. Then you have the option to PM me at any time. I do not check my PM's every day, I have a life too. But somewhere along the road, I'll see your PM and answer it. There has been only one instance of my not responding to a PM and that was for a specific negative reason. So try again Daveb, if you want. Hope we can share our expertise with you and yours with us. That's the way things generally work, give and take! Now to trading, the FishTSS_EAV2 has worked out quite nicely in backtests, Thanks to Jam. However on the AUDUSD pair it does not take any positions. So I'll keep testing. See my post above for a copy of the file. Cheers, Pip2.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I don't know where to start. For a zipped folder you must unzip the files from the folder using an unzip program e.g. Ultimate Zip, or Wizunzip. There you should see the files you want. For further help PM me. Cheers, Pip2

I tested EA1acs and it is profitable with GBP/USD. However the EA does not work with AUD/USD. It makes no trades for some reason. The EA aslo is not profitable with GBP/JPY. This is the first EA that I tested shows profit. Next week I will start forward testing. One more thing is that the lots is a fixed number. It would be nice if you guys can add on money management so the lots increases as the account balance grows. I do not understand EAv2. It looks completely different from the previous version. The backtesting of EAv2 also ends up with loss. The attachment is my testing report. Cheers

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi mry2001, Thank you for the test results. I am happy to see that this had good results on GBPUSD. [ When Profit Factor &gt; 2, Profit trades &gt;= 50% and Average profits &gt; 2 * Average Losses, I condiser that to be good; but the Relative Drawdown of 23% is quite large]. But I am not a fan of optimization (which I consider to be simply another name for curve-fitting, unless done with some reason other than results). So, if you optimized and run the backtest using the same time period, the results will be different for future or past to the test period. So, one has to be careful. The reason for no trades in AUDUSD and the losses in GBPJPY must be due to not optimizing for them (may be you do not have good past data also?). Though I told I am not a fan of optimization, same parameters will not work for different pairs due to difference in price and volatility. At least the SL,TP,TS must be adjusted based on price or ATR to have reasonable values (probably as a percentage of ATR is better). If you check these, you might get better results for other pairs also. If you can check them, let us know. It looks like Pip2 has so far released three EAs. 1. Post 575 (&amp;558): Indicator free method 2. Post 588: Uses TSS signals (based on OT3MA indicator). So, compiled version of both Indicators are needed. 3. Post 588: at some point this file was changed with the one that uses LWMA as the Indicator (built-in MT4) I think these EAs can be named as TSS1EA, TSS2EA and so on, with version number coming at the end. Pip2, I think it will be easier to refer and follow if this way of numbering/naming is used. Please consider it and if you like the idea, you can re-post them with the new names. Also correct me if I am wrong in summarizing. -chandra

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I've been following this thread since the beginning, but somewhere along the line got lost. I tried the arrows and the FISH indicators, but the FISH indicators repaint BADLY so I decided to forget it. Now it seems that TSS is making progress. What is the present state of the system and is there an indicator package, not an EA, that can be looked at?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi, chandra I run backtests and optimization many times on this EA. My settings are essentially the same as pip2's original settings for GBPUSD(Post 558) except lots, takeprofit, stoploss and traillingstop numbers. His original settings also make profit in my backtests. I agree that backtetsing result might be different from forward testing. One should be very careful with the settings especially the lots number. In my tests, lots number is 2, which means using 10% money of the demo account. This is very aggressive. I tested over last 5 months, by various start and end date. My account is never blowed, but in some specific period, it is overall in red(less than initial deposit). If the lots is 4 or more (risk 20% or more), it is very likely you will have a problem. Fish indicator is the best indicator I have ever used. In my opinion, calculating left to right is the correct way to do candle stick analysis. The latest price action is the most important. I do not know why lots of people have problems with this. Candle stick analysis is not a science. Opinion must change from time to time and the that is the best you can do. However, nothing is perfect. Alert function of Fish does not work properly so I turned it off. It often happens that alert is sent with no arrows being paint. I think they are false alarm. When the market is ranging(opposite arrows being close to each other), it is better to ignore Fish or act contrary to the Fish signals.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hi Mry2001, would you mind to explore more, why do you think Fish is the best indicator? Me myself, somehow still think that this Fish histogram is good, but everytime I see it live and everytime I change the Timeframe and switch back, the indicator surely change the way its looks like? How do you determine to use it? Thanks

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi All, as Chandra noted, I have progressed from just a simple indicator for manual trading (TSS) to an EA. I have abandonned Fish because it did not futher the art/science. Many complaints that it re-paints, and other problems. So take note Fish is dead! With the help of Jam, a contributor to this thread, I have posted on the FIRST POST, an EA he has sent to me called FISHTSS_EAV2. This is the revision to EAV1 that made multiple positions when attached to a file. Jam has fixed that! A word about the name. That EA does not use Fish indicators in any way. So the fish part of the name is a misnomer. Don't let that fool you. Its calling indicator is TSS arrow indicator. When an arrow fires it takes the appropriate position. TP and SL may be optimized, and also all other parameters of course. Jam's EA is configured so that if you want to embed your own logic for entering positions, you can do so easily since the code is well compartmented and not spread out. I believe success in trading forex is in a good EA. I like to sleep, its so nice. Oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole, to Mary Queen the praise be given, that sent the gentle sleep from heaven, that slid in to my soul. With a good EA you can do just that! Cheers, Pip2 PS I'll post Jam's EA here too.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi, Snobol1 Can you post the EA that is based on FISH_TSSv1_2? I think it is useful on daily chart. Thanks in advance mry

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Snobol, I don't see the logic in calling it the FISHTSS EA then, if FISH is no longer part of it. We are discussing The Simple System. FISH only became added to the name when the FISH indicators were used. As they are no longer used, I feel it's appropriate to drop the name from future revisions. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
New Version Simple 8.4 (Calculate time frame 1 day, 4 hours, and 1 hour) more accurate and still simple just wait alert buy or sell. Sorry for the 1st and 2nd revision only 70% accurate. Always put stop loss 25-35 pips, and TP 30-100 pips. I use in any time frame and any pair , but i prefer in 4 hours time frame with trailing stop 15.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Goldigger, I am very interested in your indicator. 3 questions for you. There is nothing under Trading Area when first loaded - is that right? How are alerts registered and is there an email alert function? What has been the performance of this method? Thanks, Paul.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I use FISHTSS indicator on AUD/USD and USD/CAD daily chart. The only problem is that sometime arrows disappear. Arrows may disappear 3 days after the bar is closed. But normally it does represent the market direction at that moment. If market is trending, FISHTSS is perfect. For example, on May 29, FISHTSS gives a buy signal on AUD/USD daily chart and it is never repaint. Last 2 bars in FISH histogram does change a lot, even from positive to negtive. I kind of hate that. the histogram that is displayed right after you switch time frame is more correct I think. After 1 minute or two, last 2 bars may change a lot.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi GoldDigger888, This is excellent. Thank you. Do you use any filters to validate buy/sell signal from this indicator. Kindly let us know. thanks and regards, Vasu

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi mry2001, If a market is trending, there are too many indicators that will be correct! Mostly, the repainting will happens only at sideways or indecisive times. If you like the fresh histograms that you see after reset (which is what essentialy the switching time frame does), basically you are using unsmoothed histogram for the last two bars. In that case, you might want to use the Fisher-m11 with smoothing parameters set to zero. It will be choppy, but you will get what you like without switching timeframes and the histograms will stay as such forever. If you like, you can add small smoothing factors of 0.2 and 0.1 to reduce the choppiness slightly without adding much lag. (All these I have posted earlier also). -chandra

[quote=stav01;1471269]Goldigger, I am very interested in your indicator. 3 questions for you. There is nothing under Trading Area when first loaded - is that right? Yes nothing, till good signal alert. How are alerts registered and is there an email alert function? No email alert. What has been the performance of this method? Nothing perfect, this is additional indicator for us don,t use it alone . best regards, Golddigger888

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Yes about 4 filter for 3 time frame.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
So I downloaded and installed the latest EA. Couldn't wait to see how it goes. This morning when I first looked at the market, my demo account was lower than yesterday. This is not part of the plan. So I looked in the history and found several buys that did not work out to my advantage. I am trading on several pairs, but the following on the eurchf tells a tale. Observe: 6-19-07 5:59 gmt Buy 1.6659 S/L 1.6634 Closed 7:54 gmt Buy 1.6639 S/L 1.6614 Closed 13:03 gmt Buy 1.6618 S/L 1.6593 Closed I notice that all the trades are stopped out on the 25 pip stop loss. I looked on the chart and found that the EA was buying into a downtrend and getting stopped out as the market continued down. I really don't think the EA is supposed to buy into weakness. This doesn't look good. I shut the EA off. I was doing better on my own following the Fish indicator. So far, the EA has dumped something between $3000 and $4000 in demo money. What an interesting development.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi GoldDigger888, what are those filters and time frames? thanks and regards, Vasu

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hi Golddigger888, thanks for this useful indicator, just a few questions: Why is it that the RSI signal (at the top) can be opposite to the trading signal (eg GPB/JPY Strong Down Trend RSI 77.33 then I have a Buy TP GPB/JPY) What is the exit strategy (eg is it when an opposite signal appears) and how accurate is this indicator? And finally what is meant by TP after the signal. Thanks, Dave

There are some problem with V8.4 (Very difficult to find 1 signal for all) . For new one (V8.5) we will find 3 option for open order. 1st option for swing trading base on 1 day tf, 2nd for intraday trading base on 4 hours tf and last for day trading base on 1day and 1hour tf . This indicator base on ema, stoc, macd and rsi. Take profit change to 1 day macd and stoc. Overbought mean when Rsi 3 1 day tf over 95, oversell mean Rsi 3 1 day below . Indicator will put information on screen prefer to buy or sell. If we find swing trading , intraday trading give signal sell option, wait till day trading given sell signal for good result. If you had opened sell trade that mean your are in the right direction.

Is there anyone can help me how to change the color and the width of OT3MAV3_1 more permanent? Cause they are always back to the original one. help me please.....

--- 帖子 #617 ---
If you rightclick on the OT3MAV3 indicator window and click "modify", then metaeditor will open. There you can edit and change to your prefered color and width, and compile it to finish. This will make permanent change. Try to play with metaeditor, and you will learn more on your own.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Thanks for your explanation MegaPips. I'll try this. Thanks IIN

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Here are more instructions. Try to use Metaquotes MQ4. Its fun! Only buffer1 is used. To change it the line should read: #property indicaror_color1 Green Or any other colour it the Meta selection. Note the first letter in the colour name must be upper case, others must be lower case. Cheers, Pip2

--- 帖子 #620 ---
This 26 jun 2007 and 27 jun 2007 result of Simple V8.5

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Yap, first time, i changed the color name with upper case all. Then i can't use it. Finally, after i look again your indicator, just the first letter, and the rest must be lower case. Thanks Pip2, Thanks MegaPips for the first explanation for me. BTW, i have a small old question, is there a way how to avoid sideways? or an indicator which can detect sideways? I have used Damiani Volatmeter, but it seems too late. Is there a bettter setting for that? or is there another good indicator to detect sideways ? Is there anyone could help me ? Regards IIN

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi, to see sideway market, I use ADX. If adx signal line is below 20, sideways market. If adx is rising above 20, trending sign. Many traders really rely on adx signals. If you go to, www dot tradeology dot com/adx.html read about it.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi, If you please add more description how to use this indicator? Because, I see only some informations on the left corner? How to translate them to trade signals? How did you have so many trades in two days, if you are using the 4H timeframe? Or is it an EA? Or, am I missing something? If you please give answers, really be helpfull. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
MegaPips, thanks again. Actually i have used this ADX, but after got some new indicators, i replaced it. Yap, i realize now, this ADX is powerful too. thanks to remind me. i will use this.... May the healthy and wealthy are always with you MegaPips..... Thank you Regards IIN

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Thanks iinzall, normally simple indicators are ok, if a trader has discipline and money management and no emotions involved. I know some traders use only moving averages and stay in the market for years with success. Good luck to you always.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Very simple just add as indicator wait till alert signal buy or sell. Follow the signal. informations on the left corner only for our reference to make sure if this signal is correct or not. Try your self and you will find out so many good signal for you. Put this indicator on any time frame and any pair. Make your trading simple.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Thanks golddigger888, will do. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi golddigger888 Thanks for the indicator, to help with understanding, could you please supply a sceen shot or chart showning an example of a buy or sell signal. Ta Yellow

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Just simple use any other indicator which suitable for your than add simpleV8.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
i download the indicator simperv85ff just display the ema does not aother indicator? why?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Iinzall, Sorry for the late response. The default setting of 10 is the original and seems OK to me. If you are using it in 1H chart, you can change that to 40 and that should show approximately what goes on the 4H chart. Using two such settings, you can improve the chances. The repainting Fish is somebody's silly mistake in coding the algorithm. So, I do not even look at it anymore. The purpose of Fish (or OT3MA or NonLagMA or even EMA or many others) is to reduce Choppiness without adding too much Lag (normal MAs or other Indicators also reduce Choppiness, but they add more Lag). There never will be a method that can do both at the same time (Reduce Choppinees AND Reduce Lag!). We have to find a compromise that suits our mind and go with it. -chandra

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yes only that, wait till signal alert to buy or sell.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
golddigger888, If you publish the MQ4 for that indicator to automate trading, I can roll it into an EA using the code base from FISHTSSEA_V2 in a very short amount of time. Of course, if you opt not to and wish to stick with the EX4 only, we will all respect that. Just wanted to give you that option. Jam

--- 帖子 #634 ---
For your reference use ema 5, ema 10 ; stoc 13,5,5 ; macd 5,13,2; rsi 3, tf 4 hours. tf 1 hours ema 12, ema24.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hello... About Simple 8.5 Its cool however there are 2 fixes that are needed please... 1. the line that says 1H EMA Down in red is shifted to the right (almost middle of my screen) please left justify this text same as the other 2 EMA lines. 2. The BUY And sell alerts... Please make it so that you can turn off these alerts or get them by email. Most importantly I wish I could just turn them off for now. otherwise I find it useful and thanks to whoever made it. I look forward to new revisions of this indicator. Thanks! -Matt

--- 帖子 #636 ---
I will turn off the alert soon . Today result

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Thanks, for the explanation chandra. It's clear enough. Regards IIN

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Great job to whoever all programmed this indicator... Can anyone please put together a set of best practices to using this indicator into a PDF? I.e. what time frame is best to use this on? If you are successful in making $ with this indicator please tell how you are doing it. Are you solely using TSS or are you combinging it with other indicators, which ones? Thanks, -Matt

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Simple V8.6 still in progress. Add email alert, pivot area, single alert, disable alert option, visual long and short are like wss, support and resistant point.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
hi golddigger,how to make sure the alert is only trigger once?because sometimes i am using lower timeframe,whenever there is a entry signal,alert will nonstop pop up!is it possible to make it optional to on and off and put the arrow for the signal?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Yes for new version , once you put an order the alert will stop till you close the trade. wait i still make some test for new version. You can on/off alert.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
thanks GD!will test it now.

SimpleV8.7FF Performance for today.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi GoldDigger, The indicator instructs to buy or sell at a price, but, how did you decide the tp and sl levels? thanks.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Use support and resistance as your tp point, or check stoc 5,3,3 at time frame 4 hours or 30 minutes. for SL i use support 2 or resistance 2.

Thanks GoldDigger.

About Freedom Rocks: The first thing they ask for is your personal info and credit/debit card info for their "Free 15-Day Trial". This is not free, my friend - to me looks suspiciously like a setup. I believe your post should be directed to commercial trading system. Also, your link contains a "34607" extension, when you can simply go directly to [url ]Link removed. Is that extension you included grant you referral $$$ for new sign-ups? The more I read about this system since IBFX began to hype it, the more is sounds like an MLM scheme. Guess we'll find out soon enough when the FTC begins to probe. One of the other things I've learned after years both trading, using the internet, and just plain living life is to be suspicious of fraud. FYI - I've traded news successfully for years, and no broker has ever shut me out of either manual or automated trading.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hello, template looks nice, but I get no signals from the indicator. Maybe the alarm is turned off, where to set it on? The previous indicator 8.5 was great, just alarming all the time.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Change Single alert false in indicator option. But please wait since V8.7 still in progress and not optimum yet. Soon the final version.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi golddiger888, I am looking for 25 pips per day or 125 per wk, can this indicator provide this amount of pips do you think? Thanks Dave

--- 帖子 #652 ---
hope more but please wait till final version. Since V8.7 still in progress, and you can find a lot reserval signal. (now i am still fix it)

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I still get no alert, the alarm is on true, but no alarm like on 8.5. What could be wrong?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
change sound alert "true", SingleAlert "false". I still do some test for new revision. And still base on time frame 1 day and 4 hours.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I changed: sound alert is on true and singleAlert is false. We will see if I get a notification this time. Or do I get it wrong? Thanks, it is so hot here, so excuse my questions, it is hard to think, hehe

Hi Golddigger, am using your simple v87ff indicator but the only signal I am getting is for example, 'Strong downtrend' or 'Uptrend' but there is no 'BUY' or 'SELL' signal.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hello golddigger888 , thank You for posting this great indicator ! I am using V8.5 the several past days , so I closed some proftable and some losing positions . I recieve alerts just of these two types : "Simple V8.5 30 Minutes Trading ..." and "Simple V8.5 Day Trading..." Never recieved a 1H or 4H . As I understand, You base ot 4H and 1 Day , so am I right that You ignore the alert "Simple V8.5 30 Minutes Trading ..." , couse of the 30 minutes ? And shound I expect 4H and 1H alerts on V8.5 ? thanks

--- 帖子 #658 ---
This indicator base on 1 day and 4 H timeframe, and check with time frame 30M before send you alert buy or sell.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
So , I still don't understand what's the difference between a 30M Alert and Day Alert ? Sorry if the question is dumb , but recenly I recieved more false signals , so I need some information to filter the true from the false signals.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Thank you, this is good question and i will let you know the answer soon, since i still make some test right now.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
So I have read the first 21 pages (mind now numb!) of this thread and downloaded the indicator, EA and Simple 8.7, whacked it all on some charts and would like to say the following: - Props to all who have assisted by their testing, programming and positive suggestions for improvement. - I love the look of where this system is heading and hope I can help along the way in some way. - Golddigger, it would be really excellent if you donated the code to Pip2 and jam for inclusion into the EA. What are your thoughts? I would like to raise the subject of Risk / Money Management for inclusion into the EA. Diallist has written an excellent thread you can read in detail here . Pip2, Jam what do you think? A combination would allow for automatic calculation of lot size, and stops when placing an order, allowing the EA to be conservative when losses are incurred and increasing lot size as the account balance increases. This is just my 2c worth. Once again, my commendation for everyones efforts on this system.

Hello, I find v85FF much better, it usually takes some time to turn but profitable all the time. I only notice that it starts showing me this message: USED BEFORE 2007.07.30 00:00 So what could this be? Is the v8ff final yet? Regards&amp;Thanks

--- 帖子 #663 ---
indicator expire date??

Thank you GentleMen for all the hardwork, Here is an Indicator that I found a few weeks ago that may help the cause, xpMA.zip , The link for the web site is http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=10098 , here also http://www.forex-tsd.com/ema-cross/4...g-average.html It was developed by CodersGuru, Who wrote the MQL4 Tutorials found in the Metatrader Forum.

Hey guys, I came across this thread just recently and read the first 25 pages and the last 5. Now I am a bit confused regarding the system that is being talked about here. Is the TSSv1.2 shown on thread #1 the latest version of it? Cos now there seems to be another one "SimpleV85Sept", or is this possibly an update to the TSS that came about in the last 20 threads??? Or what's the differecne between them??? It would be great if someone could clarify that for me and possibly a few others, many thanks.

If you are willing to invest the time to read all 45 pages (not that such would be absolutely required), you will see that, having started on one topic, we have now gradually shifted to what could be called our fourth iteration. None of the four are the same, all being different indicators. It will not be the most scintillating literature to which you have ever been exposed, but you will get a glimpse of the struggle and frustration endured as a "system" is being developed.

Thanks Doc, At least this clears some of the questions. And yes, you are right, I have been exposed to slightly more scintillating literature before but eventually I will get through all the posts and try to make the ideas work that are being developed by some formidable individuals here. A great many thanks to all contributors. Though I am already experiencing something that could be called frustration on the very first system. I have downloaded everything thats been posted by snobol1 on post #1 and thought that I followed the instructions to the letter. But apparently not, since nothing shows up on the chart, also not when I change the colour of the indicator upon initiation of it. I have the feeling that I'm very close yet so far, anyone any ideas where I could have gotten wrong ??? I have attached a pic, hope that helps. Max

I cannot get this indicator to display anything. I am assuming there are pre-req indicators it references but I looked through the thread and couldnt find a post that listed them? Maybe I missed it? Also, for those of you who have used this, do you get signals every 4hrs or can they occur at anytime before the 4hr candle closes? edit: I did get v8.7ff to work. but when I attached v85sept to the chart I get the green text at the top left saying "Simple v8.5" but thats all there is. This happening to anyone else?

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I am getting the exact same results as you described in your post.

Well I get the same info on the top left corner, but somehow I caught the alarm yesterday, so I think it is working, but not sure. The previous version was beeping all most all the time... There were a lot of alarms, but so far this week only once from v85ffsept. Maybe the brilliant author can help us... please

Sorry please try one of this 2 indicator. Actually this indicator have the same direction with xpMA indicator (and I love xpMA indicator). I make this indicator as an additional tool for me and i share it, but no a substitution of xpMA and T3MA or TSSv1.2 system. Why i put here ? Because this place is "Simple the best".

Thank you for your hard work Golddigger

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Thanks, one more question, which version of xpMA are you using? Can you attach it? 10x

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Goto #668

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Yes, I got it sorry. I am testing all four indicators now, will let you know what is going on.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I am totally confused by now with so many indicators, Golddigger, which is your latest indicator, ie the one we have been waiting for.

--- 帖子 #274 ---

. V8.7 is the last. I change the expire date for V8.5 last post. You can use it original or ff try you self which is suitable for you. i will send you new version V882008 beta test soon . We will test together and make conclusion. New one base on macd 1D to 1 minetus, check stoc 5,3,3 4 h and 1h &lt; 80 and &gt;20 and go for a signal. Last check visual with xpma and make your own decision.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
golddigger, your indicator doesn't clean up after itself when you remove it.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Yes. This is the last version clean up it self (Beta test). Hope you can enjoy it.

HI , i'd like to ask if is possible to add an double t3 or jma smoothing in this waddah explosion indicator. it's powerful indicator and i think an double smoothing t3 or jma on the waddah indi can show ,from the first close bar to the last close bar , if the bars volume keep the same direction to trend. if there is any programmers or coders here can do something like this cheers, David
