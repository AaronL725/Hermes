IF ANY ONE CAN ACHIEVE 60% WIN RATE AND WINNERS BIGGER THAN LOSSERS THAT IS GREAT IF ANY ONE CAN ACHIEVE 50% WIN RATE AND WINNERS BIGGER THAN LOSSERS THAT IS GREAT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE TRADERS MAKE 80% WIN RATE BUT LOSSERS BIGGER THAN WINNERS AND SOME OF THEM CAN MAKE MONEY BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT NEW TRADERS WHEN ONE TELL THEM THAT HE MADE 85% OR 90% WIN RATE THEY HOPE TO LEARN THIS METHOD THERE ARE MANY TRADERS THAT HAVE WIN RATE AROUND 90% AND STILL LOSER BECAUSE LOSSERS ARE VERY BIG AND WHEN THEY GET TWO OR THREE LOSSES IN ROW THEY FIGHT THE MARKET AND THE MARKET MAY BE GIVE THEM CHANCE TO RETURN THERE MONEY THIS WAY BUT REMEBER THE MARKET WILL TAKE YOUR ALL MONEY IN THE NEXT TIMES IF YOU FIGHT HIM SO WHEN THE MARKET TAKE BRIBE FROM YOU 3 OR 4 TIMES DONT BE SAD BECAUSE HE KNOW EVERY THING BE HAPPY AND HE WILL GAVE YOU BIG PROFITS FOR YOUR RESPECT REMENBER DONT FIGHT HIM HE MORE STRONGER THAN YOU AND THE MARKET NEVER TAKE ONLY 10%OF THE TIME AND GIVE YOU 90% I DONT THINK THAT NEW TRADERS FIGHT THE MARKET TO MAKE 90% OR 85% WIN RATE SO THEY STILL LOSERS WHEN LOSS BE HAPPY THAT YOU GIVE THE MARKET BRIBE BUT LET IT SMALL HE DONT UNDERSTAND THIS POINT THIS SYSTEM WIN RATE AROUD 65% AND WE RISK 1% TO MAKE 2 OR 3 OR 4 % ACCORDING TO MARKET CONDITION

Thank you for indicators and tpl. How do you use the Adx indicator in your system?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Adx help in determining if market is sideways or trending If you trade 4 hours and adx reading in 1hour and 4hour and daily are big and in your direction that is more confirmation But you can focus on macd and turtle trend and ApB candles only If i put 10 indicators there will be losses Losses are part of the game and you must learn how to deal with them Any one his win rate in this system 50% or 60% he will make money long run because Winners are bigger than losses and there some winners give you 4R and 5R So you must catch this big winners And never risk more than 1% in each trade you may take 5 or 6 losses in row by this way you will control risk and be winner in long term

Ali, really appreciate the effort and education you provide to us, also at the TMS thread as well. Our way of trading is similar (especially since I converted to the TMS system) so thank you for this. On to the question: What are the settings for the Donchian Trend? I do the charting via Tradingview on PC browser, and enter positions on my phone. Since Tradingview does not have a native Donchian Trend, I am using Supertrend indicator instead (4,3 setting for entry on 15m TF). Instead of APB candle, I am using Heikin Ashi (I guess they are the same anyway?). For the MACD, I substitute it with.. Yes you are correct, TDI (Trader's Dynamic Index). Then, one of the ways I found out to "only find A+ setup", is to use a Volume Oscillator (14,28 setting for entry on 15m). If the oscillator is pointing towards or above 0% at the crossing of the MACD (or TDI), the probability of the trade being a good one is quite great. People here who trades using the same platform as me could probably try this as well.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
It's a good system by itself but it could definitely be improved with recent tools.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks for your clear answers , Ali. In your experience, which are the best pairs for your system?

Too many "Turtle Trend" indicator or strategy on Tradingview so I am sticking with Supertrend for the moment, pretty good to give me the bias. Yeah higher time frame probably has less noise and one day I am going there, but for now I am sticking to 1h or 15m. If we're talking about emotion, my emotion is pretty much the opposite for now (who knows, I might change). Now, when I have running trades that go overnight or for days, instead of being calm, I am being anxious. If I execute and close any trade during my conscious state, or during the time I am in front of the screen, I'm feeling better. If I sleep at night knowing that I don't have any ongoing trade, I'm feeling good. It's just me at my current state. Also yes, 100% agree on focus on losses.

What is the winning rate here? Also when you are trading in four hours what is your stop loss?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
The last candle high or low Winning rate in 4 hour -daily and weekly around 65% And profit more bigger than lossers

--- 帖子 #31 ---
What about four hours? I want to trade it on the four hours.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
If sell setup last candle or two high If buy setup last candle or two low It is very good in 4 hour Firstly determine market condition according to APB candle if it good take trades in the same direction of turtle trend

--- 帖子 #33 ---
What is the ToR/ Adx setting ? Level 20 , I think . And the period ? Thanks Ali

Wow! Thank you for finding time to respond to all my question. I will go ahead and test this trading system and see how it works.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Best of luck

--- 帖子 #36 ---
THANKS BRO

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Ali, I wonder if the ADX you're using has a substitution on Tradingview.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Do not change setting of adx when reading appear above 20 and give same colour of your trade that is good

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Okay I will follow your advice - thank you

Sometimes, in order to fully grasp the system, you have to be 100% into it even though you know you could do otherwise. This is what I mean. USDCHF 1h TF. My first entry was correct in everything. Except that it pulled back and the candle changed color. I knew that it was just a pullback and I could hold onto this position; but I was trying to follow the original rule (for now, at least). Closed the position with a very very tiny profit; but then a setup candle appeared again and I should have taken it. But it was late at night in my place. I don't typically do trades after 8-9 PM so I obviously missed this one. This could have been a smooth journey to TP. Normally I am good with this, but felt a bit disappointed mainly because I had a loss before this trade, and this trade could have recovered it. But deep down I believe, in moment like this is when actually my mind/psychology is tested the most and this will shape myself to be a better person. (I have been trading for years and yet this psychology thing is the hardest thing to conquer) So, for new people that engage in this system, here is what you need to know: This system is good; it does the thinking for you and all you need to do is just pull the trigger. However, since the win-loss distribution on trading is random, your mind will be tested at all times. But come in and show yourself every day. At the end of the month it'll be worth it.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
FOR THAT I PREFER TO TRADE BIG TIME FRAMES LIKE DAILY AND LOOK FOR THE MARKET ONE TIME ON DAILY CANDLE CLOSE SOMETIMES IN BIG TRENDS IT MAY BE 8 OR 9 HOUR CANDLE AND YOUR SLEEP TIME COME AND YOU DONT KNOW WHEN WILL CLOSE THE TRADE IT HAPPEN WITH ME IN GBPJPY 1 HOUR THIS WEEK BUT I LEAVE IT AND SLEEP AND WHEN GET UP I FOUND IT STILL TRENDING IN PROFIT BUT IF COME EXIT POINT OR RE ENTRY WHEN SLEEP YOU MAY FEEL BAD FOR ME I DONT RISK MORE 1% AND LEAVE IT SOMETIMES I LEAVE IT AND EXIT POINT COME AND I DONT EXIT BECAUSE I WAS SLEEPIND BUT BY LUCK IT RETURN IN MY DIRECTION AGAIN AND GIVE ME MORE PROFIT THE BIG MOVEMENT IN YOUR DIRECTION THAT IS THE KEY BECAUSE IT REMOVE 4 OR 5 LOSSES AND GO OUT QUICKLY SOMETIMES IN SMALL LOSSE OR PROFIT THAT PREVENT YOU FROM BIG DROWDOWN AND ANY BIG PROFIT SWAPS THIS LOSSES MOST OF TIMES LOSSES AROUND 0.5% BECAUSE I CLOSE WHEN CANDLE COLOR CHANGE AND SOME OF WINNERS MAY GIVE 4% OR 5% IT REMOVE 8 OR 10 LOSSES IF THERE IS THIS AMOUNT OF LOSSES

Yuppp I'm all good now. Just needed to voice my feeling and this thread happened to be suitable hahaha. But hey I'm showing myself again today. Ready to find any opportunities.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
this are two examples of set ups a+ setup like this one a+ donot mean that it will hit rofit no it mean that you make ideal process and the market how determine go out with small losses or small profit or big profit you make ideal work if it loss i will not feel bad because i do what i can do perfectly Attached Image (click to enlarge) and this second chart normal set up and candles are sideway better to wait for range broken Attached Image (click to enlarge) these are learning chart only to deffirentiate between a+ and normal may be normal make more profit may be the two lose may be the two profit no one can predict the goal is to make you work in ideal process and the market will give you money in the long run for your discipline and ideal work

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes I closed the position when the candle changed color, but did not manage to re-enter again due to the time being so late in my place haha. I am trading 15m-1h at the moment but I think I mentioned before that one day I too aim for HTF trading. This system, and the settings of the indicator happen to be suitable to be applied on various time frames without any need to change its settings. This is why I like it; basically I could make the jump (to higher time frames) anytime I want. Will probably try slowly. Thank you for all the positivity, Ali.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Since Ali is suggesting me to trade higher time frames... AUDNZD 4H Attached Image (click to enlarge) Should have entered one candle ago, but since the price is not so far away from the original entry point, I entered just now. Note that instead of using MACD, I am using TDI (Trader's Dynamic Index). Basically gives the same confirmation as MACD. TDI is a part of the " Trading Made Simple " system (Ali is also an active contributor there and this Turtle system is similar in nature). The above thread has been active since it's first created back then in 2009, and I'm glad Ali even gives a more concrete rule in this system. Have a great day.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Ali,thanks for your patience and your clear posts. You advise to trade the big TF ( H4, D1 ) with a low risk (1%) and you are right - this trading is less stressful and often allows for very high gains But iIdid some tests and I saw that your system gives good signals also in M5 TF , but using as filter M15. I mean : if in M15 trend is long , in M5 look for long signals only . If in M15 trend is short , in M5 look for short signals only . I also keep an eye on the general trend in H1.

thanks for your reply, i mean if trading on 4H frame need confirmation of 1D frame, does it need to be in the same direction? thanks for your reply, i mean if trading on 4H frame need confirmation of 1D frame, does it need to be in the same direction?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I hope it is okay if I help answering this.. 4H and daily does not have to be in the same direction, but it will be nice if they are the same. That means, your positions goes according to daily continuation move (potentially higher reward). If daily is bearish but 4H is bullish and you took a long: that means you are taking a daily pullback trade (or in other words, daily counter trend trade) If daily is bearish and 4H is bearish and you took a short: congrats, your position is the same with a higher time frame movement, which means potentially it'll have higher reward.

Closed the position with small loss. The rule of this system requires you to close your position if the candle changes color, and it did. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Will try to enter again if another setup candle appears.

I'm not sure about MT4, but when you trade the 4H, you don't need that indicator. It's more suitable for lower time frames.

I am a beginner in learning of coding. Is it possible that I code this trading into a automated EA?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Was lucky I remembered that today is NFP day. Close this trade with a small loss, then the price proceeded to obliterate the rest of the SL Not my week. Ending the week in a minus.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I dont like EA because it dont filter the setups and dont know economic news and cant determine market condition And some emergency cases need the trader decision The experienced traders not take all setups that system give him he filter them and take the best if you take all setups you maybe not make good money because market most of the time is sideways Learning this system for six months and your look for chart were be different from first look in the beginning Traders like EA because they want to control emotional side but my opinion is the two is the same because the trader will see the EA when working and if it in profit may be close it before it make big win if the EA was in profit and donot close the trade and it turned to loss trader will not use it again the problem is already present so the problem in the trader Trader must have good behaviour and learn how to deal with losses and losses streak For me losses has big damage in our emotions and the all solutions is low risk I tooked this year loss streak of 6 losses And i donot effected because the total loss was not more than 5% I risk 1% and close most of position when candle color change and before hit stop And i have confidence in my system as and myself in losses streak market will make you lose confidence in your self and in your system And i get this year win streak 10 winners in row that made me more than 22% profit my mind try to make me over confidence and increase lot and risk more but i dont do this because if you want to be consistent profit you must have the behaviour for that If you can make EA to give us alert for set ups and we make the decision that will be great Thanks bro

--- 帖子 #88 ---
The rule is pretty much explainable using "if this then that" logic. Yes sometimes intuition comes into play but the rule is pretty simple, I guess. I don't do codes so I don't understand; but with the above explanation, do you think it's achievable?

Usdjpy4 hour

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello Ali, Come to this USDJPY H4 sample,... your trading system more on DECISION of the Trader Subjectively. Before the BUY signal ,.,there was SELL signal,... you marked it as SIDEWAYS. But when become the BUY signal,.. you didnt mark it as SIDEWAYS first ? Its I called it SUBJECTIVELY. Anyway,.. the system will be good if Traders can win money,.. thats all Cheers, Budi Dharma

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi Budi, Ali also said that he took that sell signal you mentioned. He said he got out of that sell position and switched to buy.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I know Ali said only take 20 positions max for a month. But since trading is a probability game with random individual result, but measurable as a group in the long run (given the system is right), you need sample size as large as possible to be able to be profitable. "Sample size as large as possible" means take as many trade as you can, as much as your resource (fund) allows without blowing up your account. This is because although Ali said we'll take loss in 1 of every 3 trades, we don't know the distribution of when we'll win and when we'll lose (random distribution with predictable overall result). With that in mind, I tried to evaluate this week (August 1-5); backtesting every possible trade on 13 pairs that are on my watchlist. Major and cross pairs. My personal rule: Entry, exit, etc. need no mention; completely following this Small Turtle System Trade only on 4H without looking at higher time frames (during live trading, I do take reference from HTF though) Entry is only between 10 AM to 10 PM, time zone is UTC+9 Set breakeven and take 50% partial at 1.2R, full TP at 2R 2% risk per trade In total, I got 11 trades: 4 wins, 3 losses, 2 BE, and 2 small losses (for the purpose of this simulation, let's say -0.5% each). With those results, at the end of the week, I managed to gain 7.8% for the week. Pretty solid, eh. Of course, if you are on a funded account that has daily drawdown limit, the number of trades will not be the same as the above statistics, as quite a number of trades happen on the same day which won't be wise to take them all on a funded account (for example, on August 1 itself I already had 7 trades).

bro ,here i put the sell setup in this post https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14089490 because there is engulfing bar return from weekly resistance and the next candle broken the range then go out in the small blue candle Attached Image (click to enlarge) and taken buy when the big blue candle broken the weekly resistance and macd broken zero line the market was moving in small candle then come big candle broken the range and weekly resistance with high momentum we cannot determine until where the market will move in our direction but we mange the trade by exit point when market give us signal I hope I made it clear

[quote=jpntrader;14091569] full TP at 2R 2% risk per trade In total, for me better when market still moving in your direction do not get out with 2% because there are big trends that make very big winners more than 5% it also depend on your rule but this my opinion

[quote=Alihelmy123;14091600] You're correct. It's choosing between "getting more 2R reached but miss the big moves" or "getting only a fraction of your position most of the time due to not locking the whole profit at 2R, but occasionally you get big winners" How about you, Ali, do you take partials + BE then let the profit runs wherever it likes?

Thank you Ali for sharing this simple and robust system and for all your explanation and support for fellow traders. I just discovered it two days ago and I would like to try it next week. I especially like the application to higher TF which is suitable for me. I applied your template and would like to ask about the second button that appears to the left of the turtle button. it is an S&amp;R button but the indicator is not provided. I managed to trace it to KG support and resistance, but the original does not have an on/off button. Is it your customization? P.S I have removed the histogram part of the macd by selecting the color as none and chose zero level with a solid line for clarity of the blue line crossing zero. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Realized about the blue line crossing the zero level as well, since I immediately got rid of the histogram in the middle when I first applied the MACD to my chart (although I'm using TDI instead of MACD). Yes you get less trades with that, but when the blue crosses the zero line, you really get the momentum you want most of the time.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Apologize if this makes the topic a bit out of place but I just want to share my way of deciding whether I should close my position or not when the candle changes color . To me, when I'm in a position and candle changes color, that doesn't mean I should close the position immediately. That could be just a pullback on the smaller time frames. Here is what I do: I put an EMA: length 5, shift/offset is 2. Once you're in a position, in this case is short, when candle changes color do not immediately close your position. See if the candle crosses the EMA or just "wicking" it. If more than half of the candle body crosses the EMA, I close the position. If it's just "wicking" the EMA, I'd hold.

The signal that Macd blu line gives when breaks the zero line is the same that W%R (16) gives when passing the -50 line line. But W%R gives you a clearer view because it allows to see when the price has gone in overbought (-20) or in oversold (-80) . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Ali I've been wondering if that ADX version of yours has a version on Tradingview? Tried to search it but no luck so far.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
NO. It does not repaint. The channel is based the highest high / lowest low of the last 20 bars/candles in its Trade Period default parameters. What IF you change the Stop Period from default 10 days to say, 5 days for your stop ? yellow dot lines S&amp;P 500 Daily Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #125 ---
not sure about that, when I took the trade on UF the channel was red starting a downtrend, then when price retraced the red streak disappeared, does this qualify as repaint? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #126 ---
it is because you have to wait till that H4 candle closed to confirm the 'trigger'.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
so it is a repaint then? the downtrend was already established on H1 (hence the 13:00 blue line) and it was the second red candle on H4,

--- 帖子 #128 ---
well, that depends on your understanding 'repaint' bar(0) is still the active candle and it will update on every new price ticks and it lows and highs, bar(1) to its left ... all its history bars will not repaint. current bar(0) if it make lower low than the last 20 bars, then it will update the new lowest low of 20-bars.

Hi, I am not pro coder but i can try

--- 帖子 #142 ---
You can add it But i dont recommend because this reasons I dont like EA because it dont filter the setups and dont know economic news and cant determine market condition And some emergency cases need the trader decision The experienced traders not take all setups that system give him he filter them and take the best if you take all setups you maybe not make good money because market most of the time is sideways Learning this system for six months and your look for chart were be different from first look in the beginning Traders like EA because they want to control emotional side but my opinion is the two is the same because the trader will see the EA when working and if it in profit may be close it before it make big win if the EA was in profit and donot close the trade and it turned to loss trader will not use it again the problem is already present so the problem in the trader Trader must have good behaviour and learn how to deal with losses and losses streak For me losses has big damage in our emotions and the all solutions is low risk I tooked this year loss streak of 6 losses And i donot effected because the total loss was not more than 5% I risk 1% and close most of position when candle color change and before hit stop And i have confidence in my system as and myself in losses streak market will make you lose confidence in your self and in your system And i get this year win streak 10 winners in row that made me more than 22% profit my mind try to make me over confidence and increase lot and risk more but i dont do this because if you want to be consistent profit you must have the behaviour for that If you can make EA to give us alert for set ups and we make the decision that will be great Thanks bro

Beauty in simplicity! Thanks for sharing Alihelmy123!

The best when the first candle color chang and in the same time blue line crosse red and macd zero level that is great In many times market may move in your direction six candles if there is setup in the first one you may take five or six candles profit before color change

We take trades only in first candle or second candle color change only in our turtle trend direction and blue line crose red after determine market condition IF you can't determine market condition wait for macd blue line crosse red line and macd zero level in first or second candle in our turtle direction it is very simple

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I was in this exact trade; however I got out with a small loss because the candle signaled me to exit the trade. Switched to a counter trend trade as you can see here. Already closed it around 1R because it's Friday night in my place and I'm tired for the week. Not many chances happened to me this week; several chances happened as I was busy with my day job. Ended in BE but was overall enjoying this system. Will evaluate myself and hone this system more for the weekend.

gu was good when you learened this system for 6 month you can take all macd cross lines with or without direction OF TURTLE TREND BUT THIS WAY in long time frames ONLY after determine market conditions but now only with the turtle direction only the turtle trend works as support and resistance and when you found the price touch it and return more than 2 or three times and then broken it it will give you good setup you will know all that with learning and trading this system with time

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Thank you Ali for your guidance, Almost all of my trades posted here were with the turtle direction with the exception of the first GU trade which was counter trend, but with confirmation from another strategy that I am currently using. They just happen to coincide with each other so I took the trade. I shall refrain in the future from posting counter-trend trades in order not to confuse your readers here.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Really appreciate all you help here, Ali ! When you say "Market conditions" - what exactly do you mean.. ? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hope you don't mind me trying to help. What Ali means by market condition is, is the market in trend or sideways? Certainly you don't want to take trades on a sideways market even though MACD gives you the confirmation.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
No prob, thanks for the help - understood. In which tf do you determine range or trend, for example ?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Ali actually made a good example here . But to summarize: A series of candles, small or big in size don't matter, if they keep changing colors, making wicks above and below, and candle sizes keeps being relatively same, that means it's a ranging one. Me personally, I'd like to wait until price clearly making a clear direction first, then enter on the pullback or its continuation. Trending candles: they keep being in the same color, the sizes change gradually from smaller candles to bigger ones, and only have wicks on one side of the candles (the wicks are usually on top of the candle for bullish scenario; and vice versa) Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Will evaluate myself and hone this system more for the weekend. So I spent the Saturday morning evaluating the trades I took, and also ran through this week's market to compare my own actual trades with the ideal MACD cross scenarios that actually gives you winning trades. Sadly Tradingview cannot do replay mode for heikin ashi candles so I just ran through the chart in hindsight. I managed to gain myself some insights-- although still need to be tested further-- hopefully will aid me during my trading session next week. Some information to help you understand the context: I live in Japan (GMT+9), so any time I mention below will be in GMT+9. Pairs that are included in this evaluation (also being the actual pairs I trade): AN, NU, AU, EU, EG, GU, UJ, UF (usdchf. Am I right with the abbreviation?) Trading window is from 10 AM - 7 PM. No trades taken outside of this period; only managing open position. All open position will be closed manually at 10 PM, before bedtime. Entry is on 1H time frame. Some pretty nice insights during this week's (August 8 - August 12) evaluation: If I took ALL of the entry signal during the trading window, this week I would have taken 20 trades: 5 losses (3 full losses and 2 small ones), 15 wins with all of them being closed manually. This way, winning rate is 75%. But mind you, winning rates could fall to 50-65% in some weeks that I have tested. With the above number, the potential RR that could have been obtained is 16.51R . If you risk 1%, that is 16.5% already. Gosh. Two of the losses came from trades that were executed between 1 PM to 3 PM (GMT+9). In other words, between almost the end of Asia session and the start of London session. Market tends to move the opposite way during London session compared to Asia. If Asian session is bullish, it usually turns bearish in London session. Usually the same thing happens at the London - NY session timing as well. If you happened to watch ICT's material about London Killzone/Judas Swing/The Power of 3, you'll realize why. Coincidentally, those two losses I mentioned above, are the trades that were brought over from Asian session to London session. I somewhat realized that with the above insights, Donchian Trend indicator probably isn't really needed to me personally because I can trade pro and counter trend (I'll explain the "why" below). Going forward for next week based on the above insights.. As Ali said, when MACD does a sharp cross AND piercing the zero line, that is a powerful momentum and we should ride it. The same thing also applies when MACD crosses (sharply) from the 0.100 and -0.100 area as well. It's like the oversold and overbought area on Stochastic (probably a wrong analogy, apologies if it was). The time of the day plays an important role. I still need to test this further but for now, any trades executed during the Asia session, I will close it at 4 PM which is London open to prevent further retracement/change of market direction. Any trades executed on London open, I will close it at 10 PM. This is simply because I want to sleep peacefully without any open trades No trade execution between 2PM to 3PM (GMT+9). With the above time management, I will try to disregard Donchian Trend for next week, and see if I could trade counter trend successfully just by looking at MACD. So yeah, I hope that helps people who trade the 1H time frame. If you trade the 4H and daily, that's a different story and I haven't figured out my own system for that. That's it from me. Have a nice weekend!

You said " you must learn to be patience".I agree, in trading patience is key. But - during the trade - you risk having high drawdown , especially in the high TF. Do you agree?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I don't understand I never risk more than 1% in any trade Never take more than 5 trades in the week I risk low to avoid big drawdown If you take 20 trades monthly and win 10 and loss 10 and winners are bigger you will make money If you win 12 trades and loss 8 and winners are bigger than losses you make big money This week i open Eurjpy and closed it around 3R profit Gbpjpy and closed it around 2R profit Eurusd daily trade still in it in small profit Xauusd 4 hour still in it in aroud 1R till now I will take another trade this week if the market give me chance Not all weeks like that Some weeks Win 2 loss 2 or win 1and loss 3 or win 3 and loss 1 If winners are bigger you will make money And if you losse 4 or5 trades in week and no winner your drawdown will not more than 4% because must of the time according to our exit we go out before market hit stop1%

So many opportunities today on 1H time frame. These are the ones I got in: USDJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURGBP This one is in drawdown. If heikin ashi candle closes above the 5 EMA (red line), I'm cutting my loss there. Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD Freshly opened 30 minutes ago. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Don't know what happened with my Donchian Trend indicator on Tradingview, it keeps lagging no matter how I change the settings; might be be because of the code. But since I don't understand pine coding, I changed the indicator with "Supertrend". Does exactly the same. Also, here is one useful tip to you all from Eric a.k.a Big E a.k.a Eelfranz from this legendary thread, Trading Made Simple . Ali is also a contributor in that thread. So, if you are about to take a position and you have your signal candle, then it closes BUT the next candle opens in the opposite color, do not enter no matter how good the signal candle is. I made a small mistake today on AUDJPY short; did not pay attention when the new candle opens in the opposite color (the signal candle wasn't that good to begin with, anyway). 12 minutes after I opened position, I realized that and I closed it immediately

eurgbp learning example daily chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) i dont know why traders do not like to trade big time frames in big time frames you can achieve 60% win rate very easy and winner bigger than losers donot listen to traders that tell you that they make 90% and 80% win rate you are searching for something like this from long time and donot found strategy that give you 90% win rate do not waste your time there is no something like this and if it available banks must print much amount of money to give winners be realastic This problem stems from inexperience and human psychology. Namely, a lack of experience attunes the new trader’s ear to what sounds good at first blush, rather than what actually works or makes sense Many “too good to be true” type trading systems are thus sold on the basis of incredibly high winning percentages, or “hit rates” – often 80% or better, backtested over some carefully selected time period. Because the human psyche is naturally tilted towards loss aversion, this is the kind of thing that appeals steven cohen mentioned that his best trader makes money only 63 percent of the time. Most traders make money only in the 50 to 55 percent range. That means you’re going to be wrong a lot. If that’s the case, you better be sure your losses are as small as they can be, and that your winners are bigger.

Hi! I'm very interested in your indicators, but it's a pity that I don't speak English, which annoys me. I tried to set it up, but failed. The settings shown on my kt4 seem to be different from yours. Maybe I can't speak English, so I can't set it correctly. Although I really want to have a Chinese version, I know this is a very unreasonable requirement. I really want to know how to set it up correctly. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I was in this on 1H time frame yesterday, but closed the position due to bedtime (not used to bringing positions overnight yet). Wanted to reenter today and then I realized the last high on 1H is pretty much the same with the previous candle's high on daily TF. So... I just got into my first 1D execution.

Example. Four trades result in a profit of 4 x 25 pips = 100 pips. If I want to make a profit of 100 pips from one trade, I have to trade 4 times the volume.

You close the order according to 5-MA or the candle changes color. Tks so much!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi man, I think I understand the way you think. Let's say your 1% is 25 USD; if entering on 4H makes you having to wait four times longer (compared to 1H entry) only to get the same 25 USD, while at the same time you could have made 4 winning trades on 1H, might as well quadruple the volume on 4H, right? Haha. It's just a matter of preference. Ali emphasizes entering on higher time frames because according to him, it's better for your psychology/mental/mind, and less noise.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yeah I am slooowly going there. Entering on higher time frames on a big account is more beneficial to your daily life. (on big accounts, the % gain you need is far less than if you have a small account) But I'm still working on my psychology now. Not used to sleep with a position that's still on. However I am placing a wider stop loss on that EURGBP and will try to sleep tonight with that trade still going hahaha

Hello Alihelmy123. Can you help me for understanding situation? On EURJPY H1 i mark two situation. 1 situation red line, price below red turtle, candle close below Averages Channnel Candles, macd cross under 0 level - we can sell on this mark candle? Second situation Turtle green, candle close above Averages Channnel Candles, macd cross above 0 level - we can buy on this mark candle? Yep i understand then ACC not red for sell position and not green for buy, but how you see for this situation? Thx!

Ali, you are entering EURGBP on daily time frame. Now the daily candle turned the opposite color but the daily candle just opened, need to wait until it closes to determine whether or not you should exit, right? So, what was your judgement to exit the trade?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Missed these two trades from yesterday. (edit: the yellow vertical line is the signal/setup candle) NZDUSD I was in front of the screen but somehow did not see this.. Might be because I was distracted by work? Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURJPY Saw this but since the candle were small, I did not take this. Turned out it would have become a nice win If I took it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cutting down my watchlist now so I can concentrate better, because normally you WILL get signal during London open, so might as well focus on few good pairs that normally moves fast during London open.

The essence of trading is profit/loss and time. I recommend the time of one tax period for evaluation. It is not the best idea to have only one trade with expected profit in % per year.

Want to share this for everyone. I trade the 1H and this is my favorite setup. First you want to go to the daily time frame. Find your usual setup as if you were going to enter the trade on daily candle. We know this system is based on momentum, and if one signal/setup candle appears, this means usually the next candle will continue the movement. Then you want to go down to 1H time frame after that daily signal candle closes. Then guess what? Yes you're right. Just find the same signal candle to the daily direction. Depending on the pairs, usually the 1H signal appears around London session. TL;DR , this is the usual 1H entry, but has a really strong confluence in the form of daily signal candle. Here are two examples. I can literally find tens or hundreds of examples (both played out and did not play out) but for the sake of this post, I'll just post two. Time shown below are GMT+9. EURJPY 1. Daily time frame. We see that signal/setup candle appears on July 25 (vertical dotted yellow line) ⇒ this means on July 26, price is expected to go down, right? Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. On to the 1H time frame. On July 26 just right before London open, we again find a bearish signal candle (vertical dotted yellow line). Now, Donchian Trend - MACD - price action both giving you bearish signals (that's SIX confluences already). I don't know what's wrong with you if you don't take this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDUSD August 16 - daily TF signal Attached Image (click to enlarge) August 17 - 1H execution Attached Image (click to enlarge) But as we all know, not every scenario will play out! So be wise with your risk management. Try backtesting it this weekend, it'll up your game next week.

Hi, I don't want to challenge your competences, because you are doing a very good job here, but the example on the AUDUSD currency pair from the D1 interval on August 16 is not a good sell signal in my opinion and from what I understand this strategy. In this example, the price is above the blue TURTLE line, not the red below it, and then this example would be a good one. Nevertheless, I do not see any sell signals here, and then on the H1 interval you talk about the sell signal in accordance with the D1 interval, on D1 there is no signal, unless I misunderstood the rules of this system. I am asking for a hint from the author of the post to resolve Alihelmy123 doubts, if you could see this example, I would be grateful. And do not treat my words as criticism, but a lesson to learn about this system Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I would just like to thank Ali and JPN for their posts. Philosophically this method really resonates with me, and I have had a good 2 weeks in the market, thanks to you guys. Ali, can you just please clarify the reason for the moving average channel in the revised model. Once again Thank you.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi Nolan, noo I don't feel challenged at all, if I'm wrong then I'm wrong, haha. Also I respect you for pointing this out politely . You had the choice of calling me names or using unpleasant words just like we like to see in other threads. Okay so the discussion is about this: D1 - bullish. Turtle/Donchian Trend is showing bullish color (green on my platfrom, blue on yours) H1 - bearish. With this, the MACD crossing down on the daily should not be counted as signal. Right? The idea of this trade is: D1 is bullish, but then there is a MACD cross to the downside. This means, D1 is pulling back (retracing) to form a higher low. If so, then we will see H1 forming a bearish movement. In other words, I am taking a daily counter trend move. That's why on my note on that screenshot, I wrote something like "we don't have to pay too much attention on the Turtle Trend direction on the daily". That is because I just want to find the daily momentum to confirm that the next daily candle will turn bearish as well. If I am sure that the next daily candle will turn bearish (because of that MACD cross momentum), that means the next day, I have 24 pieces of H1 candles to take a short position from. Am I making myself clear? Tried my best to explain in as simple as possible. Take a look at the drawing below to see visually what I was saying. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have a nice weekend, Nolan! --- Edit: On second thought, I probably should have not posted about this counter trend idea. It's a bit advanced for people who just started learning the system. You will need to have the understanding of how multi time frame works first. Nolan thanks for your input!

GOOD QUESTION BRO I MENTIONED IN POST 216 https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...3#post14101493 THAT EXPERIENCED TRADERS THAT CAN DETERMINE MARKET CONDITIONS (SUPPORT -RESISRANCE- TRENDLINE -MARKET TREND OR SIDEWAY) CAN TAKE TRADES WITH MACD CROSS LINE WITH OR WITHOUT DIRECTION OF TURTLE TREND IN LONG TIME FRAMES ONLY EXAMPLE I TAKE A EURUSD TRADE IN DAILY CHART AGAINST TURTLE TREND BECAUSE I FOUND RETURN FROM WEEKLY RESISTANCE AND DAILY TREND AND MACD BLUE LINE CROSE RED AND ZERO LEVEL Attached Image (click to enlarge) BUT I DONT RECOMMENDED TRADING AGAINST TURTLE TREND IN LOW TIME FRAMES AND ESPECIALLY FOR NEW TRADERS I HOPE I CLARIFY ANY EXPERIENCED TRADER CAN TAKE ALL MACD CROSE LINES WITH OR WITHOUT TURTLE TREND AFTER DETERMINE MARKET CONDITIONS

HOW TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOOD TRADER OR NO ASK YOUR SELF THIS QUESTION 1- IN ANY TRADE DO YOU THINK HOW MUCH YOU WILL LOSE OR HOW MUCH YOU WILL WIN 2-TAKE TOO MORE TRADES OR FILTER THEM 3- DID WIN AND LOSE HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON YOUR EMOTION OR DIFFERENT EFFECT 4-DID YOU HAVE CONFIDENT ON YOUR SELF AND DONOT TAKE ANY TRADING IDEA FROM ANY ONE UNTILL YOU SEE IT AND MAKE YOUR DECISION OR TAKE ANY TRADE EVERY ONE READ THIS POST PUT YOUR OPINION AND ANSWER FOR THIS QUESTIONS AND TELL THE TRUTH

--- 帖子 #266 ---
1- IN ANY TRADE DO YOU THINK HOW MUCH YOU WILL LOSE OR HOW MUCH YOU WILL WIN I think about how much I'll have to pay if the trade doesn't play out. Winning is never guaranteed but losing is almost certain. 2-TAKE TOO MORE TRADES OR FILTER THEM I trade too much now because this system does the thinking for me and all I have to do is pull the trigger, but I swear I will set a maximum amount of trade per day from now on because I experienced the bad effect last week 3- DID WIN AND LOSE HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON YOUR EMOTION OR DIFFERENT EFFECT Losing still feels "aaww man.." a bit to me, whereas winning doesn't really affect me. I am gradually becoming able to forget my loss fast and my win even faster. 4-DID YOU HAVE CONFIDENT ON YOUR SELF AND DONOT TAKE ANY TRADING IDEA FROM ANY ONE UNTILL YOU SEE IT AND MAKE YOUR DECISION OR TAKE ANY TRADE Oh YES I am absolutely confident with my decision especially since I converted to this system. When you trade pure market structure, sometimes the way you see the market will be different from what others see. You see sell while other people see buy. But with this system, given that you have backtested and forward tested it for enough time, as I said before, the system already does the thinking for you, you just have to pull the trigger. Confidence is the "only" thing you need.

thank you very much for this great thread

Hi Yaya, thank you very much for the warm message. I'm glad I could help. So last week, I forgot which day, but there was this one day where I found multiple opportunities on 1H time frame within a very close time interval. I ended up taking a total of five trades a day . I thought that when your wins and your losses are not evenly distributed, you need to collect as many sample size (take as many trades) as possible. Plus it's my own account anyway; I have no daily limit like those prop firm accounts. All trades were executed safely within my risk profile and I was aware of the amount of money I would lose if those five trades fail. But then all of the sudden, I felt anxious; even when knowing those trades were all within my allowed risk. "What if those trades did end up hitting full SL and all profits from the week are cancelled because of today?" I thought. That's when I realized I was trading too much. If I had known that I would be having 5 trades at a time, I would have diversified my 1% risk to all of those trades (so each trade would be 0.2% risk). But the problem is, those five trades happened not at the same time, so I didn't know I would be having 5 opportunities. this is the point where I decided, okay from now on I will only be risking a fix amount of % a day (in the form of maximum trades per day). A revelation, you would say. Haha. What happened to those trades? I ended up monitoring closely all of those and got breakeven overall. Guess what, if I had not done that, they would have gone full SL! All of them! Before this system, I traded pure market structure with supply and demand, so there were lots of days where I did not get any trade. Therefore, on the day that several opportunities come, I took them all. That mindset was naturally brought over to this system; however since I pretty much find setups every single day, I now realized that I should change this aspect of me.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Ahahaha yes just like what you thought. I will try to focus on fewer numbers of trade this week, and limit my maximum trades per day so I don't overtrade (this way, my position size could still be the same because I am already comfortable with the current risk profile). Experience taught me well. Haha. Have a nice trading week, Ali. Ali this is a great insight, thank you. I trade the 1H and I do look at D1 first. But for the lower time frame reference, which one you would advise me? Will 15m be good?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
great bro but taking many trades donot increase learning curve you must learn to be have the behavior of experienced trader by fitering the setups and take A+ ONLY IF YOU LEARN TO MAKE 10% PROFIT FROM 15 TRADES IT WILL BETTER THAN MAKING 10% FROM 50 TRADES AND REMEBER ALL EXPERIENCED TRADERS GET LOSSES AND SOMETIMES LOSSES STREAK AND HOW YOU DEAL WITH LOSSES THAT WHAT DETERMINE YOU WILL SUCESSE OR NO

WELCOME BRO

--- 帖子 #279 ---
bro if you trade 1 hour you must look for 4 hour and 15 minutes before looking in 1 hour you must go first to 4 hour determine trend and marketconditions then look to 1 hour and 15 minutes in 15 minutes look for pattern broken in your direction or any thing in your direction example if 4 hour time frame is long you go to 1 hour and wait until it go short and then give you setup to move long so long setups in the same direction of 4 hour timeframe YOU will have good chance to make money with high probabilty some traders but stop in 1 hour and take profit in 4 hour Time frame it decrease win rate but winners are very big and make them good money

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Roger that, Ali. Will try if I can find something out of this concept. Also thank you for the second tips. I think it's somewhat similar to what I did before; aiming for HTF low/high while entering from the LTF. But now I'll just enter and exit the trade according to the system rule, that alone saves me from decision fatigue. Oh btw, Ali, could you tell me the setting for the average channel? I am experimenting with similar channel indicator on Tradingview, Attached Image (click to enlarge) but I think you haven't told us the setting for that. I am using these settings, please take a look if this is ok. Moving Average Channel Upper channel length: 20, source: high Lower channel length: 20, source: low offset/shift: 3

Selling EURUSD yesterday from around London open (4 PM GMT+9). Vertical dotted yellow line is the setup candle. Leaving open position overnight is still the biggest uncomfortable feeling for me, so entry on 1H and closed the position before bedtime is the way I do this. Closed the position at 10 PM GMT+9 in profit, but look what would have happened if I leave it on until this morning: full TP! Attached Image (click to enlarge) But the opposite thing could happen as well; you get up and find out that the trade went full SL. Whenever I feel a bit bad because the trade went to TP while I only extracted a few pips from the market, I always imagine if the trade turned out losing instead. Few pips are better than minus, I guess

--- 帖子 #295 ---
No you must try to be patience to catch big movement it will make you 3 or 4R and that what make money we not trade to take small pips from price fluctuation we need to ride big trends when market give us chance If you take 3 or 4 big winner each one around 3 or 4R and losses 7 losses each of them less than 1R you will still make money You sometime loss because donot close in small profit but know problem When big winners come you will remove 3 or 4 losses Winner traders there trades consist of big winners and small winners and small losses Loser traders there trades consist of big lossers and small winners and small lossers

Working my way there! Told you as well that I, too, one day aspire to trade the HTF. Used to trade the 1-5 minute TF; the move to 1H itself is already a big change for me so I need to do this gradually. Some of your words about trading the HTF resonated well within my mind, now it's my turn to work out some way to train my psychology. Bear with me as I (hopefully) show progress here, Ali

Attached Image (click to enlarge) This method very good. Because not sitting in front of computer all the time, any suggestion how to exit the trade quickly when the candle changes its colour?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Do you use Tradingview, and on your smartphone as well? We use 5 EMA, and when price changed color and its body crossed the EMA, we exit. You might want to set an alert for that so the app will notify you. I assume you trade the lower time frame? Because if you trade the 1H, you can just check the chart every hour. If you trade 4H, only have to check the chart once every four hours.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I use H4, &amp; D1. But even H4, I kind of worry. I trade using my phone, at night or morning, then I check on my computer. May I know how to set alert, so that my phone will receive notification?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Aah, I'm sorry for the false assumption. I am replying on PC now so I cannot take screenshot of the phone app, but the steps are the same. Click/tap the 5 EMA, then on the top left, the corresponding indicator will be highlighted. Click the three dots on the right. Click "add alert on EMA" Attached Image (click to enlarge) You want to set the alert like this: "[pair name] crossing up/down [EMA]" Attached Image (click to enlarge) (if you are in a sell position, you want to be notified when price crosses UP the EMA, and vice versa) Choose the media to which you want to receive the alert. Save it. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I am having the same problem on the one hour time frame, going to bed at night, whether to close trade or let run and take my chances. So was hoping an EA exists that would close the trade when price closes above/below 5 ema. I posted this request on platform tech, but haven't received a reply yet. If I get one I will post here.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
just nab these from next door , look like it started here, silly me , ... well these is my take

--- 帖子 #303 ---
That's actually a good idea, EA for exit! But to me personally in my time zone, since price rarely go full TP overnight, so far I'm good with closing the trade before bed. As long as MT4 still showing blue numbers, that's a win.

Yup, was aware of that and now price showing a bullish engulfing so I closed the position with a bit of loss. This week wasn't the best week in trading for me, but amazingly the losses are minimal. Had a losing streak for 2-3 trades already but it's not even 1% of my account. Amazing.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Do you draw resistance or support by yourself or is there any indicator?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I often make the mistake that the price runs 1R and then turns back, if I close the order according to the 5MA, it is usually a loss or SL, How do you usually close the order, can you share it with me, thank you

--- 帖子 #321 ---
You are correct, since this is heikin ashi candle which shows you the average price, the actual closing price is usually much deeper than the one HA candle shows. (a bit of trivia: "heikin ashi" actually means "average leg". Heikin is "average".) That means depending on how you place your SL, by the time the candle changed color and it crossed back the 5 EMA, SL is hit already. Attached Image (click to enlarge) What I usually do is, on Tradingview I have two layouts: heikin ashi candle and normal Japanese candlestick. I monitor how candles on the normal chart form, and when I see a clear engulfing after rejection, that's the sign for me to get out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I know, this way of managing your open trade seems a bit out of place because we are supposed to use heikin ashi candles, right. Well it's just me and my background of being used to trade with normal candle and without indicators, so I have this layout just in case. But, if we follow the "way of the game" by using only heikin ashi candle, I strongly suggest you, especially if you trade on 1H and lower, to place your SL not above/below 1-2 candles before, but rather above/below previous high/low . This way, believe me, you will be able to exit the trade with minimal loss, just like I experienced this week (about 3 consecutive losses but the total drawdown isn't even 1% of my account). "But the wider the SL, the lower our RR will be" Obviously. But in this system, as Ali said multiple times already, we focus of what we can control: our risk. At least for me personally, I believe we are not trying to achieve a super precise entry with 12-13R target like our friends over there at the SMC (Smart Money Concept) technique. Hope that helps!

I know, that's why on the screenshot I wrote "for the sake of this example let's pretend that we have a perfect MACD cross" We're talking about the exit, that's why I searched for an example that has the most appropriate scenario for your case, and emphasize more on the exit.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Sorry for misreading this, it's probably because my English is not very good. I seem to have lost all my trades this week, what do you think about support and resistance areas,

--- 帖子 #326 ---
No problem, man. It's okay. English is not my mother language either. We'll learn together. Support and resistance areas are of course good additions, if not the main thing of this whole industry. Ali has been informing us about the importance of paying attention to S&amp;R of higher time frames (weekly, monthly) to be aware of. The last learning chart he posted is on post #309 . He also warned me about my yesterday trade; I took a sell of GBPUSD while the price is already at weekly support level and having the likelihood of reversing. It's on post #313 . So.. If say, you have a sell signal but price is already at the daily, weekly, or even monthly support level, just be aware that your trade might not play out. How many trades you took this week? On what time frame? Where did you put your SL, was it above/below the signal candle or was it above/below previous high/low?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I trade on H4 time frame, SL 1% of the account. According to him, setting a fixed sl or following the high and low of the candle will be more reasonable. Can you tell me more about multiple timeframes? thanks

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Correct, placing SL above/below one or two candle before your execution candle is right, because this system is based on momentum; if all is well, price should go directly to your direction. However, if the candle sizes are relatively small, you can place your SL above/below the previous high/low like I said before. The purpose is, when price is in a drawdown, changes color and crosses over the 5 EMA, you can close the trade manually without hitting your full SL. --- About multiple time frames, here is a simple example. Please read the annotations on the chart. GBPUSD DAILY Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD 4H Attached Image (click to enlarge) We can see a buy signal on 4H, but price is already arriving at daily strong level of S&amp;R level, plus it's the upper channel of the ongoing trend. Yeah you can absolutely take the trade, but just be aware because it might reverse! (Like it actually did)

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Thank you for your detailed sharing, I will try to find a profit in my next trades. Are you trading follow the turtle channel indicator? I don't see it on your TW? Do you think it is a good idea to move SL to BE when the price moves 1R.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
hai can you share indicator in your tradingview ? thank

--- 帖子 #331 ---
you can use any indicator for support and resistance if you cant draw them best of them is kg support and resistance i sometimes use indicator but most of time draw myself because indicators not very clear

Glad to know that it's not only me who think the market is not moving good this week! Last week market has been moving quite big so it needs to rest, I guess. Yeah, there were several good opportunities on 1H time frame and I missed that. Life gets in the way during live trading.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I have the turtle trend (Supertrend for me) but not turning it on at that time. Most of the time, actually. I just trade according to the average channel, MACD, and 5 EMA. That already tells me a lot. In fact, I have been watching how heikin ashi moves and I have this thought that I probably don't have to pay attention to MACD as well.. Still need further examination but that's it for now. For setting your BE, 1R is a good idea. If I trade the 1H, I usually go down to 15m and once I see a clean break of structure there (to my direction), I just set it to BE even though it's not 1R yet.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Oh that's why market felt so weird this week, especially when you enter on 4H. Several opportunities were there on 1H, but I didn't spot it because of day job and other things. Not the week for me, ending it with about minus 1%. BUT... that -1% came from around 5 losing streaks. Managed to cut the loss as little as possible thanks to this system. I could have lost FIVE PERCENT instead. How good is it.

JPNTrader i want from you to take around 4-5 trades weekly risking 1% and when market give you chance to be in right side try to get maximum profit you can get trading is a losing game and trade i take i know that i losse until market tell me that i am right Market is designed to make experienced traders loss 1 from 3 trades If you take 20 trades monthly 10 losse and 10 win But winner must be bigger we risk 1% to make 1 or 2 or 3 sometimes 4 or 5 when there is chance Some weeks you will get 5 winners Some weeks you will get 5 lossers Some weeks you will get 3 winners and 2 losers it is random but in long run you will make money I am not like others that tell new traders that they make 90% win rate there is nothing like that from 3 years i was trading system it is win rate only 40% but i was risk 1% to make 2% fixed and i make money this year around 66% there was 3 losses months and closed the year with good profit you must have the good behaviour When get losses you will loss confidence in your system and in yourself and you will try to get more filters the indicators the last thing i focus in and when you win 6 or 7 trades in row you maybe forget something called losses and get overconfidence your mind tell you increase the size donot listen to your mind because losses are come I like trading near strong level and use indicator to determine entry and exit and there also losses No one win every day no one when every week no one when every months But there are traders when every year because if there edge win rate 50% or 60% they give time to there edge to make them money There are traders that post that they win every day dont listen to them and dont waste your time

--- 帖子 #346 ---
One of my friends took to me that he trade four months with only 1% profit and he will never trade again i told him great he get angry and tell me what is great i told him that he is great trader because 95% of traders lost all their money in this period of time so you from the 5% that still live and if you still like that you will make money long run Trading is a game you must still in it to make money Most traders fight markets when loss with big size they may live three or four months only then die And when get win streak become overconfidence and increase lot and losse because no one can control emotions when risk more So if you have the behaviour to control your mind you will make money long run

--- 帖子 #347 ---
When market give you profit and take part of this money dont get angry Because if you get angry he will take the money he give and your money in your account

Roger that, Ali. Yeah currently I am trading the 1H but there is this possibility that life circumstances would "force" me to trade the 4H. I have also cut down on my watch list to 5 pairs only (and they are the major ones), so that certainly will help me to take less trades especially on 1H. What I like about this system is, it doesn't require you to chase perfection (during slow period, winners below 1R happen quite a lot; big winners normally doesn't exceed 6-7R), but it is also able to minimize your losses (given you don't place your SL too tight). The fact that I have 4-5 losing trades this week but the weekly drawdown is only a bit below 1%, tells so much about this edge. It's just me vs myself now, to train my patience to let winners run. Just as you taught me.

--- 帖子 #349 ---

number 2 is the best when in the same direction of turtle trend macd setting(5-7-4) like this example Attached Image (click to enlarge) if any one can determine market condition and (weekly -montly - daily) support and resistance and trend can take trade with or without direction of turtle trend in big time frames near the strong levels

if you want to focus in some pairs determine market condition for all pairs in saturday and sunday and focus at the pairs trending and avoid pairs moving sideway after determine the pairs you will focus in make to them multi time frame analysis this is good way to determine good market condition to work in and remeber there will be also some losses but cut them quickly and let profits run if market give you chance

Here is a screen shot of a trade I took earlier this morning. I jumped in long once the price passed through the zero line on the MACD and the price action was above the yellow moving average. I used the pivot line from yesterday as my exit marked with an X. The green line is my entry. I believe I applied the rules of entry correctly. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I did two trades this morning. Here is my second trade where I shorted USDCAD at 1.30556.

Hi man, AUDJPY to me looks sideways especially if you look at the weekly time frame. But daily still shows signs of going up and on 4H, looks like it kind of breaking the resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So yes the buy is still valid for me but watch out for deep pullbacks.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Those are pretty solid counter trend trades! For the second one (UCAD), I see that you're trading MACD bounce, not cross? I assume you have a pretty good experience in trading. I forgot on which post I mentioned this but I had a thought that I could trade mainly by looking at the price action and the EMA only (the average channel indicator also uses EMA). I also took a counter trend on AU yesterday just by looking at how price action was doing, and did not bother about MACD cross. Only making sure that the blue line already crossing the red by the time I wanted to buy. (Yellow vertical line is the signal candle) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The actual result was less than what I showed here as it was a bit late and I closed my trade prematurely, but you get the idea. Telling this to show that this system is tweakable to suit your style, but that's it, I won't be posting any kinds of counter trend trade or trades that are not using the original system anymore. Want to respect the original system and don't want to overwhelm those who are still new. Have a nice trading week, people.

I got out with loss -0.3% in this trade I got out when candle color change and close without any hope it will return so i cut losses quickly for me better to take five or six small losses like this better than one big loss that without stoploss and wait for loss to become -3 or -4 Some trades give me profits around +3% or +4 Maximum loss in any trade for me -1% but most of time i go out before market hit stop when i found my self wrong with -0.2%or0.5% or-0.7% so when big winners come it will remove this small losses easy and give you money In losses case your ego try to not take loss and leave it to return dont listen to it because it will return sometimes and in one trade it will make you big losse you cant affordable So don't listen to ego and cut losse quickly Some traders dont want anyone know that they take lose because their ego is high and think that lose is bad thing This traders doesn't remain in market for long time Any trades has 5 probabilities 1-small losse 2-big losse 3-small win 4-big win 5-breakeven Any one remove number2 will make money in the long run

Good Day: Today I went with two trades again. I will show the first one with the NZDJPY. Went short at 85.44 with the red heiken ashi, price under the yellow moving average, price moving the zero line on MACD and the price action seemed to be bouncing off the high from yesterday. My target again was the pivot from yesterday as well. The price pushed down hard for 25 pips and came back and hit my sliding SL at plus 79.00 dollars. The downside is I did not wait for the Turtle Trading Channel to turn red. I used the previous day high for my reversal line. I did not execute exactly. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Price action below the yellow moving average, below the turtle channel, red heiken ashi and MACD moving below the zero line. The weakness of this trade is I waited to long to enter.

one of most important topics in trading is determine your objectives someone need to achieve 50% yearly other one need 100% and some traders put unrealastic objectives remember when your objective high profit you will risk more if you cant control emotion in high risk decrease your size in my opinion more than 1% is high risk if you take 20 trades montly risk 1% to make 2% and your win rate around 50% you will make 10% montly average this is very good if you can achieve this it will great

Alihelmy, Nice thread here and an interesting system. Been lurking for a while and look forward to trying out some starting next week. For those struggling the last couple of weeks...August is a tough time to be trading. A lot of the professional traders are on vacation, especially in Europe where a lot of the big players are working. Low volume makes the markets volatile and hard to read consistently. You should see improvement as more traders come back to the markets in September. I'm looking forward to trying this with the top-down (in respect to TF's) approach that has been highlighted here. Entering on the lower time frames with less pip risk and then trying to exit using higher time frames for longer runs. I'll share going forward as seems appropriate. Thanks again Alihelmy

August went pretty good at the beginning up until the middle, being better than last year. But as it approached the end.. Mehhh. Last and this week have been so-so, if not bad. My system that requires me to close trades at certain times of the day pretty much helped me especially this week. If not because of this I would have been in the minus.

Happy to hear that, Ali. Yeah this system focuses on what you can control the most: your risk. Adding the 5 EMA to use as the sign to exit your position is THE most important trade management aspect of this system. This is EU on 1H, showing two trades two days in a row at a similar time. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The first one is the trade I took. Managed to quickly cut the loss because the system told me so. Look at what would have happened if I just let it run: a full stop loss. Market just wasn't ready to move lower. The second trade was the one that showed the market's true move. Didn't take it because I took AU and GU instead, but turned out EU was the one that resulted in the largest move down. --- On a related topic, despite the wobbly last days of August, this week was pretty good. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Managed to gain 4.5% this week. Last week was minus so it compensated for the minus. I don't think I will be trading today because it's NFP day.

A very, very solid trade today on EURJPY, 1H time frame during Asian session. My plan is not to trade today, but fingers were itchy seeing this beautiful opportunity, so position size is only 0.01 or 0.02 lot (I forgot). Trading just for the sake of not wasting the opportunity, therefore entering with very minimum risk. Yellow vertical dotted line is the signal candle. Entry is the candle after that. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Why was I so eager to enter here? Because this trade checked so many checklist from various trading disciplines/concepts. Entry requirement from this Turtle system is fulfilled (bullish structure, MACD bouncing up, price crossed 5 EMA and average channel) From supply-demand POV: price just broke daily supply and now successfully mitigating the imbalance area From SnR POV: price just broke strong resistance and now retesting the trendline Now you understand why my fingers were so, so itchy to take this trade, don't you. (Anyway, this trade did not yield me any consumable amount of profit) Officially done for the week. Have a nice Friday, people.

I have taken multiple trades since 9-1-2022. I use a trailing stop on my orders so you will see multiple small orders. Here are my results. I do like that fact in this strategy we get out fast if the price is not our direction. As you can see on my results I do have a loser. I am trying a recommendation of the volume oscillator that is found on the trading view platform. I run the trading view and MT4 side by side on my monitors so I can watch the volume oscillator when I get a signal on the MT4. I do like this strategy! Thanks to Alihelmy123 for his work on this!

Hi Mr. Robert, thanks for the trade posts - I get to learn a lot from them! Do you trade only 1H TF ? Also - how do you work your trailing stop ? (by pips / under last candle etc.. ?) Thanks

--- 帖子 #409 ---
you told great words and one of the secrets of that system( I do like that fact in this strategy we get out fast if the price is not our direction) yestraday i closed two lose trades gbpchf -0.7% and eurcad -0.2% very small losses but i get out fast when candle color change these losses never effect my emotion and i still it audjpy in profit more than 1% and cad jpy +0.4% when you let losses small when you get big winner and this happen 20% ot time you will found good growth in your account 80% ot time you will make small losses and small profit when market give you chance to big winner be patience and try to get biggest profit

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Mr Robert, that's a fine looking journal. I know right, the "get out quick" is probably up there at the 3 most awesome aspects of the system. I think I mentioned the volume oscillator as well on the first few pages. Which time frames are you executing on? And what is your recommendation of the oscillator setting? I tried to use that as well but got rid of it completely now as it didn't add value to my trading; but that was probably because I didn't utilize it correctly.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) thanks for all of the feedback. Attached is the move I am currently in with the AUDUSD. Let me see if I can answer everyone's questions. As shown in my pic that is attached I use the trade manager that can be found in the market place on MT4 or MT5. I set my trailing stop based on the pair being traded. Secondly, I use 4H and Daily charts for my direction on the 1H TF. I typically trade the 1H chart based on the confirmation of this strategies indicators. I do try to target 1-3 trades a day based on the setups and the potential target for TP. As you can see on my charts I do use, supply/demand blocks or order blocks for potential reversals or continuation. Right now in the current open order with the AUDUSD I have two targets for profit. I am looking at yesterday's low and if the price breaks through I am looking at my next support block at .67184. Lots of news today with the USD and AUD so who knows what will happen. My SL is now BE plus 2 pips so now I am trading with the banks money! I did open another order so I do have two open orders on this move.

Combining the Turtle System with SnD and smart money. Nice. "I use 4H and Daily charts for my direction on the 1H TF. I typically trade the 1H chart based on the confirmation of this strategies indicators." Do you mind elaborating what is it that you're looking on 4H and Daily to then determine buy/sell bias on the 1H? For example, on post #251 I explained about my daily - 1H setup combination; looking for a strong confluence on daily TF to strongly support my 1H execution.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Let me see if I can answer your questions. Here is a pic of the Daily chart that I looked at over the weekend on the AUDUSD. I cleaned it up for simplicity. I believe you can tell that the daily chart is saying a down trend. As you can see I drew a red line that appears to be significant on the downward move. Now look at the hourly chart and see how significant the red line is once touched. Once touched on the red line I used the small turtle system to confirm all entries and exits. The target for potential exit is yesterday lows or the low with the yellow X. Of course, this all depends on the price action withing the turtle system. Now look at the hourly chart I have attached. Notice the red line and the confirmation of the turtle system. Lastly, look at the last attachment. I have overlayed the turtle system with my research on the AUDUSD and you can see where I used the confirmations for the short order. Hope this helps Attachment g Attachment g Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[quote=jpntrader;14088563]Sometimes, in order to fully grasp the system, you have to be 100% into it even though you know you could do otherwise. This is what I mean. USDCHF 1h TF. My first entry was correct in everything. Except that it pulled back and the candle changed color. I knew that it was just a pullback and I could hold onto this position; but I was trying to follow the original rule (for now, at least). Closed the position with a very very tiny profit; but then a setup candle appeared again and I should have taken it. But it was late at night in my place. I don't typically do trades after 8-9 PM so I obviously missed this one. This could have been a smooth journey to TP. Normally I am good with this, but felt a bit disappointed mainly because I had a loss before this trade, and this trade could have recovered it. But deep down I believe, in moment like this is when actually my mind/psychology is tested the most and this will shape myself to be a better person. (I have been trading for years and yet this psychology thing is the hardest thing to conquer) So, for new people that engage in this system, here is what you need to know: This system is good; it does the thinking for you and all you need to do is just pull the trigger. However, since the win-loss distribution on trading is random, your mind will be tested at all times. But come in and show yourself every day. At the end of the month it'll be worth it. {image}[/quote Very interesting , maybe one could have just set a stop under the first color change candle, considering it was a bullish hammer.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Ali thank you so much for the awesome thread I trade 8 H and 12 H, that way I can always keep my trades under control. One thing I would like to add: Stop Runs, especially in some pairs like EURUSD is so prevalent (big boys algos are programmed that way). So if I see an opportunity AFTER the Stop Run it gives me double confidence.

Hi JPN I agree on everything except the scaling out. Which goes against the "keep losses small, let winners run" rule. The reason being, your losses will always be with a full wagon, your biggest winners only with half. An exception would be to consider the campaign as 2 trades, one with a faster exit, and the other one with a longer time exit. Then evaluate both "money managements". Interesting would be, to run the same backtest, (which btw. produced still an awesome performance ), with both trades all the way to the maximum potential. Just my 2 cents worth. All the best.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi cuchuflito! Yes yes, that's an awesome advice which I am trying to implement as well right now. But the reason of me scaling out at the time of that post, is because I never had a full SL taken out using this system even until now. The 5 EMA will tell you when to go out, and most of the time (well actually it's safe to say every time) a losing trade only costs me 0.3-0.4 R. That's why I implemented the "pay yourself" mindset. But that was one or two months ago. Now, if I ever take any trade on 4H, I just let it run and use trailing stop. Thank you for your advice, really appreciate it

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Thanks for your sharing! how many pips would you normally trailing stop? Are you currently not using the exit item, only exiting when you hit the trailing stop SL? Sorry about my english? Thanks Thanks for your sharing! how many pips would you normally trailing stop? Are you currently not using the exit item, only exiting when you hit the trailing stop SL? Sorry about my english?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
No problem man, I could understand that. My trailing stop loss process is the one that I have been using since years ago. So let's say I am entering on 4H. I will go to a normal Japanese candlestick chart and go down to 1H, and see if there is any CLEAN break of structure to my direction. I will place my trailing SL above the last high/low. Yes, I am using this system's exit strategy as well, which is the 5 EMA. But I don't know, it's just a habit of mine ever since before I converted to this system.

Just closed this trade on USDJPY for about 575 pips. I chose to move stop loss under each swing low on the way up instead of closing when price closed below 5 EMA, which kept me in the trade longer. The reason I did this was there was no resistance anywhere on my chart 'til all the way back in July 1998, so had lots of room to run. The reason I closed now was it was reaching that historical resistance with about 250 pips to go, so to be safe, got out now. My stop loss was about 60 pips when I opened the trade, so pretty good risk/reward! I also switched over to Japanese candles to manage the trade.

"[quote=jpntrader;14099587]{quote} Will evaluate myself and hone this system more for the weekend. So I spent the Saturday morning evaluating the trades I took, and also ran through this week's market to compare my own actual trades with the ideal MACD cross scenarios that actually gives you winning trades. . This way, winning rate is 75%. But mind you, winning rates could fall to 50-65% in some weeks that I have tested. With the above number, the potential RR that could have been obtained is 16.51R. ..." 2 Things: First, that is the trait of a professional, studying and backtesting. Second, if you can make half of that 16.51 R expectation, you are on your way to becoming a millionaire. 16% a week compound!!!!!! 20% a month, compound triples the account in 6 months. Congratulations, that is the way to beat the beast. I live in Germany, our stupid, dumb communist government , that came up with a new law (against the Constitution), by which, you can only deduce 20000 Euros yearly as a loss. After that, you are forced to pay taxes on your losses, effectively capping any higher trading income. Worse. If you make a million and lose 800000, you still have 200000 win right? Wrong, you will end up with huge tax debt. It will be contested by the German traders in court, they will probably win, but it will take years. The government openly said they want to destroy the "trader profession".

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I read before, people freaking out about closing trades too early, and leaving a lot of opportunity on the table. I also read many times, that is the hardest part of trading, letting winners run. I am not an exception! This might be helpful: I started using this system as a trigger for my trades and opened a new excel file for it. I always document my trades in detail. So I will have 2 pages on that file for this system. One, the real-time results, with date, amount, win/ loss, average, expectancy, etc... A second one writes exactly the same results if I would have followed my rules. The idea is to recap, compare, and rub my nose against the facts, so next time I want to pull the trigger too soon I (hopefully), think twice. Hope it helps, all the best.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Ali: Clarity for me please. Exit with this system is paramount because we want to limit our losses quickly. On the 4H TF we exit the position once the candlestick changes color on the close and price is now on the other side of the 5 MA line? Is this correct? Thanks Mr. Robert

I want to find out more since this is rather shocking... This is a useful info, thank you very much.

Aah this week just isn't my week. Managed to gain 5% until Wednesday, then had a losing streak on Thursday and one of it was a crazy candle that went full SL (first time I experienced full SL on this system). Down for -1% until this morning (GMT+9); I managed to gain 2%, making my overall gain for the week is a little bit below 1% because of commission. All of the above happened with me following the system. That means the probability just wasn't by my side this week. Yes, several great chances happened at the time I wasn't available (meetings, lunchtime, etc.). Still Friday afternoon in my place but I'm just going to call it a week. Time for a nice, cold beer.

"You have any internet source in English for that? I want to find out more since this is rather shocking..." https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ermany-will-be Once you reach 20000 Euros in losses in a year, you better stop till next year, in Germany. Example: 100000 Win 80000 Loss You made 20000, and pay 30% tax on that? (end up with 14000 in your pocket) Wrong: you can only discount up to 20000 on losses. So you pay taxes on 80000!!!! 24000, you end up owing them 4000, although you earned 20000.

Stop Run , in my humble opinion, is the most reliable "indicator" in Forex. After that, divergence. Then Turtle- trigger on a smaller TF. Then Turtle trail. Check this CADCHF D. I use Dynamic Trader Software, which has tools for "predicting" statistical targets in time and price. The red square was calculated by the software in advance. Check the pink time bars below, which mark the highest probability swing change date in time.Right on the spot, does not work every time, but it is useful stats. Right on that day, there was a stop run, and macd shows a clear diversion. The second chart is a 4H Turtle. BINGO!

And the second 4 H turtle.

That is just my system, I guess you can use whatever trading style you like: Trend Lines, Support and resistance, planetary cycles, religious predictions, . But then STOP RUN and diversion are the main filters in my book. Then turtle is a great tool for trigger and trail. You all have a fantastic weekend.

I took a small loss on USDJPY today, decided to get out when bar closed under 5 ema. I just watch the seven majors, all on my screen together. USD appeared weak on all seven, but I still took the buy trade as this system told me to. Probably was not a good idea. I think correlation between all these pairs is important, and will try to take this into consideration in the future. But thanks to the rules my loss was minimal.

[quote=jpntrader;14099587]{quote} Will evaluate myself and hone this system more for the weekend. So I spent the Saturday morning evaluating the trades I took..." Hi JPN. I was looking at your evaluation. If your backtesting was correct: You would have an expectancy of 1,20; meaning your system would gain 1,2 $ per dollar (or should I say Yen), risked. If someone can replicate those results in real-time, it puts them on the very top list of traders on the planet. The problem is most of the time, real-time comes out not as good, cause there are other problems like: -mind games -broker games -news -mistakes. Still, if you make it to be half as good, it is excellent. You scored 16,5 % on that test, in 1 week. Let´s be more conservative. Here is what 20% monthly does to a compounded account: (triples every 6 months, roughly). Start with 1000 $ (the price of a second-hand bicycle right? ) After 1 year: 8916,10 2 :79496,85 3 :6319748,72 (over 6 million) Granted, there are limitations, once your lot size comes close to 5 lots, you are too visible for the Big Boys, who will do anything to run your stop. Then: the most dangerous is called the "Black swan". The best trader I know in Germany, he only trades EURUSD tick-charts. He will hardly be in an open trade for longer than a couple of minutes. The reason being is that "exposure" is the biggest danger to all of our open trades. Anything can and does happen in this crazy world, and the market runs 1000 pips against you, without the broker being able to fill your order. (sorry they will say ). In Europe, you are "protected" by law, so as to not lose more than your whole account. So the trick is to have your money safe in your savings account, still risk your 1% of a fat account, that is not in the broker's box. I know Alihelmy suggests it is better to trade bigger TF, and it does have advantages....but there is more to the picture than meets the eye. Sorry for the long post.

Here´s the link to the trader I mentioned, there is a lot to be learned from him, even if you don´t trade tick or second charts. He does loads of statistical studies and knows exactly how the trading german laws and taxes apply to him. A total pro. Here is the thread: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...rex-navigation

This is my approach to closing trades: Instead of closing altogether on a color change, I just move my stop to that bar high or low, sometimes you get lucky. This is a EURGBP 8 H trade I am still on. On those blue bars, I moved the stop to their tops respectively, and now it took off my way. In this case, it worked, so far. Next color change I will move my stop again, till it takes me out. My 2 cents worth. All the best.

[quote=jpntrader;14099587]{quote} Will evaluate myself : AN, NU, AU, EU, EG, GU, UJ, UF High JPN I am testing the 1 H chart. I checked the correlation of the pairs you listed. Some are way too correlated on the H chart: AUDUSD/NZDUSD 99% EURUSD/USDCHF -98% etc.. Meaning if you get a signal on correlated pairs, you would be trading double the risk. I will make myself a less correlated list (for the H chart), on the weekend, also including pairs with a small spread. Show it to u guys when I am done. Correlation changes also depending on the TF. The pick below is for the H.

one of the greatest point in this strategy that we never loss more than 1% and most of the time less than 1% when candle color change and profit we cant determine when market move we still in it and this sometimes make us very big profit i cant determine my profit only my risk

Here is a small list of Hour pairs not correlated/low spread 5 altogether, to avoid going crazy. Hour chart has advantages and disadvantages: -Not too fast. -You can avoid the news and swap. -No weekend spread. -More opportunity, which if the edge is real makes more cash. -More opportunity, more practice. -Less time exposed to Black Swans. DISADVANTAGES: -You become a bit of a slave of your PC, (which may be better than being a slave of your Boss.)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
... Ignored Hi man, yes I am very well aware with that. Here is how I handle that. EU and GU are on my watchlist. First, even though they have a positive correlation, one will move earlier or move farther than the other. Let's say I have the same sell signal for EU and GU. I usually check EURGBP; if it's bullish, then we know pound is weaker than euro and weaker than usd as well. It's weak overall. This way, GU will drop lower than EU. So I'll just go with selling GU. That simple. Or, I would just practice basket trading; divide the risk between those two pairs.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
By no means do I want to put higher TF down. People like Alihelmy, produce 15 to 20 % monthly. And probably with less work How can you criticize that? It depends a lot on trading style, time schedules, etc. My broker has some brutal weekend spread spikes, so that already is a big hurdle for me. EURGBP 14 PIPS EURAUD:17 PIPS GBPAUD: 28 PIPS USDCAD: 11 PIPS USDCHF:13 PIPS And that was 10 minutes after the Sunday night open. They will wipe out any "tight" stops right away , that´s "Bucket Shop Broker " business.

Your chart looks beautiful as well. Welcome, sir/mam. This system is indeed beautiful, it gives you the peace of mind while having a good win rate although the RR is not absurdly high. we have more and more people coming here and giving great advices, while Ali (the OP) keeps giving to-the-point psychological tips. Let's learn together and be better together.

This week was better than the last one. I was having a very very busy Monday and Wednesday that I did not trade on those days. Traded on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday with a total of 5 trades: 4 wins and 1 loss (loss with slippage because I didn't realize it was CPI day!!) But in total, I gained 6% this week. Next week is going to be very busy with day job with field works... Either I don't trade or trade 4H or daily candle, but we'll see. Have a relaxing weekend, people.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thats awesome! 6% a week and you are shooting to be a millionair in soon future! Of course there also going to be negative weeks though. Maybe we could start sharing setups when they occure and help each other that way. (just a suggestion) I will certainly try to do that when I catch setups. Wish you all a great weekend and happy trading next week. Cheers

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I concur with the idea of posting accurate A+ setups and it seems a laudable development. Thank you for the apt initiative.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I agree.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I agree too, provided we don´t feel responsible for the outcome. The 5 H pairs I follow had nothing to qualify as A+. Yes, happy weekend.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
That's correct, no one is responsible for the outcome.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Not for the shaking hands, but last Friday, if you look at : 5M EURGBP USDCAD There were plenty of winners What makes it difficult, is to read the chart properly and click the trigger, fast enough. And yes spread, I have 2 brokers, one is OANDA , and their spread is no good. Practice practice.

Just because it's the weekend does not mean you cannot trade Some very nice opportunities present themselves all the time. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then why make your life more difficult than it needs to be? Just trade the 1H-Weekly Timeframe as suggested and make your money with much less stress? Dont know why People are so focused on lower timeframes. More opportunities doesnt equal more money. Most of the times it's exactly the opposite. Of course that's just my Opinion. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
true. the lowest TF is for me 1H. i never trade lower. Its not because i have no time. Just less stressful and if you have an system that works(and Ali's system works) you will anyway make profit/money. Patience + Good entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Really happy to join you and learn in this thread, I like your strategy because i have to work 9-5. As a newbie, I just wanna ask about how you use trend lines. Do you put them only on weekly amd Daily ? And how do you use Price action with this strategy ? Can you suggest some books or thread where we can learn more about trendlines and price action? Thank you very much Sorry for my bad english though.

I trade the 5M and 15M also for scalping between 5-20 pips, but not on this system, there are more reliable trigger and exit strategies for such lower TF, and they are not so stressful.

Hi Ali and members of lucky members who find this topic. Firstly thanks for clear and for give information to Ali. ı readed topic in one day its awsome. ı will add some pair for example. Good evening from Turkey.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Now I don´t want to complicate things too much, but here are some facts: -Take any winner you had, any time frame, entering with only 1 position. -Go to the next lower TF, and calculate how much more could you have made, if you added only 3 positions more, after the first entry. I have this very very old "Chaos Theory" little software, which gives me some cool entries, with exact instructions.(see pic). I mentioned those 2, 15M trades I took and calculated the difference. I made altogether 3,94 R. (not bad for 2 days). Now if I would have gone down to the 5M, and using my little software, added 3 positions to each of the 2 campaigns, I would have made 22,25 R. If I would have respected strictly my exits, just changing my stop to below the first color change, and trailing that way: 44,5 R in just 2 trades!!!!!!!!! The USDCAD yesterday, would have come very close to ending up in a 6,5 loss , which would have put both campaigns to roughly BE. Having said that, those very big winners have the potential of doubling your account in just 1 trade! I am going to do the same, using D1, and adding on 240. Again, start adding on 240, AFTER the first entry on D1, the trail always on D1, the higher TF. The little arrows on the software are hit entries, of course, if you really want to get aggressive, you can add many more entries, that, for example, would double the big winners again, but for that you need a very strong stomach, cause here and there you could hit a 10% looser. And btw. ONLY AAAAAATrades!

--- 帖子 #559 ---
That big drop you saw yesterday on USDCAD M15, was a good old Stop Run created by the big boys. Fundamentals and news might push the market up or down for days and weeks. Big Boys will run the show, hitting as many retailers stops as possible, from beginning to end, that is the name of the forex game. That is why actually Ali is right when he recommends NOT o trade lower than H. The higher the TF the more expensive it is for them to move the market. On the other hand, if anyone can master the lower time frames, there is the big money. Almost all the odds are there against you though! Just my 2 cents, you guys and girls have a great day.

--- 帖子 #560 ---

This is an example of an NZDCHF D1 I just back-tested. The first entry would have been 16 days ago, on the bottom of the third red candle, after MACD lines crossed. I calculated the profit, using as an exit, yesterday high , but this trade could continue much longer. After the first entry on D1 I switched to M4 and took the first 4 entries that my chaos software gave me. I carefully adjusted the stop and lot size exactly to 1% per entry. Results: 18,6 %, in half a month on only 1 trade. (hit a few of those in a month, and one can double the account!) Easy peasy, just follow the rules of this thread, adding on H4, at the beginning of the campaign. Then just check every night and adjust stop if needed. If after 3 or 4 bars a Day bar would have turned blue, I would have changed my stop to the top of that bar. Either it would continue my way, or if stopped, maybe BE maybe a 2 or 3 % loss.

Learning charts. Today's opportunity...

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Check this: The original rules of the thread: -Close on candle color change. Next option: _ Place a stop below/above the color change candle against you. Next option: -Place a stop below/above a candle that touches the MA line. Next option: -Place a stop below/above the candle that penetrates the MA, breaking it. If you look at the red rectangle before the long swing, you will see how it penetrates the MA at that point. Look at this D1 USDCAD chart. Using the latter option, you would triple the results or more (trade would be still open.) You probably need to enlarge the pic. to be able to see the MA line on this black chart.

Maaan glad to see the system really helps a lot of people. Been away from forexfactory forum, only opening FF to check news, but the discussion here has been awesome. How was your September using this system, people? I gained around 12% with below statistics. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I know somewhere out there and someone I know gained more with his/her system. But this turtle system is the one that suits my lifestyle the most. And 12% for a system that doesn't require you to think hard.. How good is that. Due to life circumstances, I even tweak the system a bit more. That's one of the reason I have been away from the discussion as well, because what I'm doing is not good for this thread's consistency. So I have been experimenting with fixed pips and fixed lot for every trade for the second half of September. Win rate is about the same, probably a bit more to the low side, but I am guaranteed to get 2R for the winners every time. This saved me a lot of time and I can focus more to my day job. Yeah, will collect more data as we are advancing to the last quarter of the year. Very glad that this year I came across the TMS method, then was enlightened by this turtle system. Right in the time where I needed a trading system that revolves around my daily life, not the other way around like the way it was before. Have a fun weekend, people. Let's do well for October.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Jpntrader, thank you for all your work in contributing to this thread. I’m based in Australia so I’m interested in your results in trading a similar time zone, while also trying to hold down a day job! So a couple of questions:- 1- Are you still trading the 1 hour charts or have you dipped into longer TF’s? 2- Which pairs do you trade? 3- Which hours do you trade? Cheers,

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Very nice discussions found in this system. One particular benefit I find is that the entrances and exits are clearly defined. Thank you so much for all of the contributions.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
The golden rule to trading: keep your losses small, your winners big. Scaling out does just the opposite, you always get hit with a full load, and your big winners only have half a load or less. This example is another simple way of scaling in. USDCAD 15M first entry and stop trailing. M1 to add aggressively. You can do the same for example, with D1 bars and adding on H4 or H1. This adding (scaling in) system is using exactly the thread´s rules for entering. So after the first entry on the bigger TF , you add on every signal but using the smaller TF. You can limit your adding to 3 or 4. You can also divide your entries by percentage risk, instead of risking 1% per entry, you can risk half a percent, one-quarter of a percent, etc. Doing this, ensures your winners are much bigger than your losers. Here are the pics. the first chart shows all the entries, the second one is the M1 with the detail. The last red arrow down is the exit given by the first M15 red candle. Note that in this example (Friday), all the entries were winners. Sometimes the last entries will be small losers. If you get stopped out in the beginning it will be most likely with only 1 position. You can do the math on this one, and compare the difference, using only one entry or 5 entries. You can also back-test some higher TF . Have a great weekend.

Hi BigKev, you're welcome! If you're in Sydney I think we're only 1 hour apart now that you're on daylight saving time? I got so many help from people here, so every time I have something that's proven to be useful, it's the least I can do to give back. Also I am more than happy to answer your questions. 1- Are you still trading the 1 hour charts or have you dipped into longer TF’s? Yes I still am. I thought about trading on the higher TF (4H or daily); but if my bigger objective is to, someday, pass prop firm evaluation, according to my backtest result then I wouldn't have the time to achieve 8-10% in one month. I could, but then I think I have to risk more, which is not wise. 2- Which pairs do you trade? Currently I focus on five pairs that moves great during Asia and London, and the ones that are low spread. The major ones: EURUSD, AUDUSD, GBPUSD The Asian movers: AUDJPY and USDJPY (AUDUSD also moves well in Asian session, as you must have already known). EU and GU have a positive correlation, meaning if one is bullish, the other will be too. But the entry signal will be different between them each time. So I watch both. I use Fusion Markets as my broker to be able to have that low spread. Are they famous there, Kev? They're from Aussie, right. 3- Which hours do you trade? My trading window starts at 9 AM Japan time. I will place my last trade at 6 PM Japan time. Sometimes my last trade is at 7 PM but lately I found that pre-NY trade usually doesn't end well.. I might be wrong though. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
This is awesome. On post #251 I shared my favorite setup: finding the 1H entry according to the valid signal that appears on the daily TF. Your version is actually a better one; executing on the daily (the bigger TF) and ALSO on the 1H (the smaller TF). Plus, with your basket trading method (dividing your risk across several trades), risk is manageable and winner will be big. Thank you very much, I am reminded of my own method. Will try to find any signal on 1D as well before going down to 1H! Haha.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
This is a back-test I just made on USDCAD D1. I did it by closing the trade on that first red candle , but according to my plan, the trade would still be open and growing.My stop moved below that last red candle, on Thursday. My Plan: (D1) -First entry on D1 as per Turtle rules. -After that, add on every H1 entry signal, according to Turtle rules, including the D Channels color. -The stop on every new entry is the D1 last trailed stop. -Every entry has a 1% risk. -Trail on D1, 3 bars behind, no inside bars counted. Results: 1,90 R Taking only the first entry as per Turtle system. 7.18 R adding on the H1. At no point in the campaign, there would have been any stop bigger than 1, maybe 2 R. The campaign took a little less than 3 weeks. Mind you there might be a lot more to the upside!

Ali, Question for you. if you see a set up candle and a MACD cross but the candles are going sideways in a range - but then a few candles after the initial set up, price breaks the range in your favour - do you still take the trade? (even though you’re late) Or do you ignore that set up and move on?

One of my friends suggest to me to take ftmo challenge and my trading money can use it in any other business To get many income I found it good advice and told him i will get the 100000 challenge He told me begin first with the 10000 challenge because the stress of time target may be effect you and many traders lose in there first challenge I convinced with his advice and take the 10000 challenge and i achieved the target of the first stage 10%in 7 days But i need to trade for 10 days to pass the challenge One of the bad things happen during this challenge i put the lot wrong in one trade that make me lost 4% in one trade in 28-9 if that was not happen i was achieved now more than 10 % but no problem The next days i will open trades 0.01 to pass the 10 days trading Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is my D watchlist. Waiting for: .Macd line cross through 0 level. -With Donchian color supporting the trend. AA trades only, to start the campaign/s. WATCHLIST, expecting a trigger (on some) this week, maybe next: EURZAR GBPAUD NZDCHF USDCNH CADCHF CHFZAR EURGBP EURHUF EURSEK EURUSD USDCAD

--- 帖子 #589 ---
i'm also doing the FTMO challenge. Do you still use the H4, D1 time frame to join the challenge?

--- 帖子 #590 ---
First things first, Alihelmy, I wish you the best of success , with the FTMO, which I am probably going to start too! Back to my USDCAD D1 trading back-test. Now that the trade would have ended, here is my approach accordingly, for the next campaign: -The arrows are the beginning and end of the campaign. -I enter my first "lot" with the daily Turtle signal.(AA signal). -Then I add in the 240 chart, using my Chaos software signals, which gave me 7 entries in the beginning, plus one entry using simple Turtle, all those on the 240. -The stop for every lot (except the first one), was on D1, 3 bars behind, no inside bars counted. Results: -taking only 1 lot, the D1: 1,82 R -Taking all the entries I mentioned, 9 altogether: 15,17 R. -Risking 2% per lot that would have generated a 30% growth in my account in less than 3 weeks. So I will study if I can repeat those results on FTMO.

thanks bro when you began dont care about time look to get A+ SETUP IN FIRST EVALUATION YOU CAN RISK 1.5%OR 2% AND TAKE CARE MAXIMUM DAILY LOSS NOT MORE THAN 5% OR YOU WILL LOSE I CHOOSE FTMO SWING BECAUSE I SOMETIMES LEAVE MY ACCOUNT NIGHT AND IN NEWS IT WILL GIVE YOU LOW LEVARAGE 1:30 YOU WE DONT NEED MORE THAH THAT IN SEOND EVALUATION DONT RISK MORE THAN 1%

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Thank you very much, a very cool strategy, I will use it. I have passed the FTMO challenge before but I think it was just luck because after 2 months of live account management, the account has reached the over-loss level. I'm liking your thinking in this strategy, I'll give it a try!!

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Yeaaah great news man. How did you manage the 4H-1D trade specifically for the evaluation? Like "exit more aggressively when candle changes color even it's not crossing 5EMA yet" or "only execute when price is at weekly support" etc. That would be helpful since I think we ALL here are aiming for passing prop firm I am having a wild guess that at some point at your attempt, you entered right at the time market was about to explode to your direction?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
1- IN ANY TRADE DO YOU THINK HOW MUCH YOU WILL LOSE OR HOW MUCH YOU WILL WIN Yes, I do think. -Always Risk 1% -1R just moved stop loss breakeven -Then (example: uptrend) if the price goes in the right direction I move the SL to below the Turtle line, don't put the TP 2- TAKE TOO MORE TRADES OR FILTER THEM I selectively signal and after I have 3 open positions, I don't take any new signals. 3- DID WIN AND LOST HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON YOUR EMOTION OR DIFFERENT EFFECT Losing less than 5% I am not affected by emotions. Losing more than 5%, I am easily stuffed with more positions and want to recover the loss soon and find the original breakeven level. 4- DID YOU HAVE CONFIDENT ON YOUR SELF AND DONOT TAKE ANY TRADING IDEA FROM ANY ONE UNTILL YOU SEE IT AND MAKE YOUR DECISION OR TAKE ANY TRADE EVERY ONE READ THIS POST Yes, I was confident in myself. I only enter my own orders when the signals are full.

i everybody, sorry for my not perfect english. First of all i wish to make congratulations to Ali for the great System is giving to us. You are giving me a hope to be consistent. I am trading by 3-4 years but never be consistent. I blow up a couple of accounts but i never give up and i desire every time to start from basic and learn the lesson. My problem is lack of consistency due to my greed and fear and bad money management. I am starting again from zero as a beginner even if as theory i am not.....By the way sorry for this outlet. I have a doubt on the entry: 1. at the first post there is written that it is conservative if: in buy i enter after blue line cross red line but below the zero orizzontal line, below an example posted by Ali Attached Image (click to enlarge) in Sell as opposite, i enter after blue line cross red but above the zero line Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. later in the thread there is written for the beginners to entry exactly when the cross blue and red happens on the zero line and this as my 2 week experience give great chance of success but low probability of setup Can you please explain better with example if: if the cross red blue happens below(buy) or above (sell) zero orizzontal line i start considering the entry at that cross (red - blue) or later after the blue and red has been crossed ad as single red and single blue cross the zero line? Below an example Attached Image (click to enlarge) "Market condition" you Ali told us is something to be understood, i know some easy concept as trend, support resistance ecc. but how can i learn better what are you meaning? Do you advice books or something else. Ali just a curiosity: are you a trader for living or a parttime trader and also the other fellows in the way they wish to share their experience. I am close to pension (2 years), i am old eng. but i lost the job and at my age i want to use this time until pension to build extra knowledge to build a side salary. I love studying... Sorry for long post. I love you all mates. Thanks anyway you want or not help me. Bye Paolo

--- 帖子 #598 ---
"I have a doubt on the entry:" Chau Paolo, my take is that you can classify entries in AA or A.( not below or above MACD 0). There is, like for good pasta, some discretion. Experienced traders can add filters using: EW, Fibos. , trendlines, Support, and resistance, etc. just use the one you feel more comfortable with. Then maybe you would risk taking an "only A" setup. Just my 2 cents. Buon Giorno.

Hi, have been testing out this system for myself. There were a couple great setups this morning at 3-4 AM EST. I had eyed them out during the day but unfortunately went to sleep an hour or 2 before they played out. EURUSD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDCAD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZDUSD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I verified support and resistance and overall trend for all these pairs on the H4 and Daily timeframe but still missed out due to sleep. Oh well, at least it serves as a proof of concept. Hope some of y'all caught these moves. To finish off, I am not sure of the use of the average channel in this system. Could someone enlighten me? Thanks a lot and I look forward to continuing to progress with this beautiful system.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hey Ali I want to ask you something. These pairs that you are trading, if we take a look at how the market moved at least in September 2022, we could see that there were lots of signal appearing at the same time. For example, on 4H time frame on the third candle of the day, we see AU - EU - GU giving us sell signal. How do you approach this? Do you execute all of the signals on those three pairs?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Correlation maybe?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Probably. For me most likely I usually divide my risk into those 3 pairs that give the same signal at the same time (basket trading) and trade them all, but since Ali have so many pairs that I guarantee will give you 3-4 signals at the same time, I just wonder how he approaches this.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Things seem a bit flat today, didn't see any good AA Setups

when you found many setups in correlation pairs example if 4 pairs give same signal try to get best 2 of them or open in all and decrease risk to 0.5% in each one

Hi JPNtrader, tks for you smart condivision firstly, Sorry for my ignorance but sometimes i do not understand the acronim 1. (2R TP) you mean you risk 1% as ALI told us and get out at 2% profit without checking exit rule? (candle cange color) 2. FTMO stay for.....sorry about it Just a refresh on the ALI method: If i set risk 1% and entered in the trade and my trade is going bad but the candle is not changed color, are we waiting for change color to close the bad trade or even if the color has not changed but the trade P&amp;L is worsing i get out? Ovviously i am asking this considering the trade has not hit the SL. Thanks for clearing my doubt Paolo

--- 帖子 #637 ---
In bad trades get out quickly when candle color change dont wait to hit stop In good trades if the market give you chance to get big winner be wait In ftmo challenge i got out before exit signal because target achieved so i dont want to be more in the trades But in my account i never get out until i get exit signal I hopi i clarify it

No i am not pro trader I am still learning i have goal and i will achieve it But i I love to reassure you that I am consistent profit in this game more than 3 years This game no more than mind When i told you wait for big profit i know 90 dont do this because it is hard for them When i told you cut losess if candle color change 90 % don't do this because emotions effect them but me lose and profit are same i love the time after lose because the reaction after the lose determine the winner from loser 90% of consistent losers do the same mistakes every time and tell them self that they dont do it again but they still do it Because they cant control themself in emotional state and that happen because the big excepections that they put in this game and they want to get rich fast They dont put realistic expectation that they may be lose For me i focus to make the process steps in excellent way not in performance and not what i will do with money i will win

Hi Paolo, oops I'm sorry for the confusion! Okay so let my clarify. On post #628 I said this: " Great man, great. Increasing the risk a bit but playing it safely (2R TP) because this time the end goal is the % target from FTMO, not the moon. Praying all the best for you!" 2R means 1:2 Risk:Reward Ratio (usually shortened to "2RR", then so many people including me shorten it again to 2R). Ali risked 1%, and he closed the trade immediately when he reached 2%, or 2R, without waiting for exit signal. Usually he holds the winning trade until 3R, 4R, right? But he played it safe at 2R only because he is doing an evaluation challenge for FTMO. FTMO is a prop firm company. You pay 500 euro for a USD 100,000 account. You are challenged to grow that account for 10% within 30 days. I don't know what FTMO stands for, though. That's why Ali played it safe: take profit (TP) at 1:2 risk reward ratio.. Because he is trading under pressure of achieving that target. Hope this clarified it!

a have a trade GU on H4!!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
I also saw this deal

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Yes, this happens. Also because it's daily time frame, losing streak could feel like forever because the length of each trade. Heck, even winning trades could feel like forever as well. For me personally, that's why I never take daily TF trade hahaha. If you need immediate feedback for your trade, 1H is the best time frame to trade on. But narrow down your watchlist if you ever decide to do so. I don't post chart screenshot anymore because I have stated that the way I do the trade, although still within this system, is different (so I don't go out of topic). But this is the beauty of this turtle system: you get to adjust the system to your own self. We have different characters and life circumstances to begin with. This MACD settings, combined with heikin ashi candle, makes the signal valid in every time frame you are on. Well, I don't know about the time frames below 1H because I don't touch them anymore. Several variations are possible using this turtle system: Trading using the original style Trading using fixed pips (therefore fixed lot) this certainly needs more backtest about how big the average movement of a certain pair is, on certain time frame Trading like what Ali does for his FTMO evaluation: using original system but you don't hold the winner too long, just aim for 2R Let's do this together, man.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
"We have different characters and life circumstances to begin with" For example, nowadays my day job is so demanding that I am now starting to shift to 4H time frame instead of 1H. Too many missed trade. Also, while I 100% respect Ali's system of holding a winning trade for as long as you can, and of course I attempted to try it so many times, for now my own character isn't suited for that. I strongly feel that I need to pay myself while ensuring the winner is bigger than the loser. If what was supposed to be a big winner turned very small because of candle changing color in a massive way, I would feel mad by the fact that I gave back my profit to the market. If I got mad, it could affect my mood and performance of my day job. Yeaah I know, trading should not involve emotion, but we're human being after all. I could probably change to a more patient person in the future, that can hold my trade for days or weeks. But I know that certainly it will take time to change such a fundamental character. So for now, I tweak the system to my own self, and trading in such way that the trading style suits my life circumstances, while still respecting this whole turtle system that Ali has kindly shared to us. Good luck for all of your life aspects for the rest of the week, people.

I appreciate that you share a lot of psychology. There is a concept that has been floating around FF for a few years now, that most retail traders entries are completely random. If that's true then how are traders consistently losing money from random entries? Their emotions.

Hi JPN, Do you take all macd line crosses or just those that also cross the zero-level ? Thanks for your continuous input here - precious!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi Yaya how are you, hope everything is going fine there! Ah yes, so after some time with this system, I noticed some patterns and now here's how I approach the MACD. If MACD is ABOVE the zero level, I only look for BUY (meaning I look for a cross UP while MACD is already above zero level) I also do Ali's original system about MACD crossing up the zero level If MACD is BELOW the zero level, I only look for SELL (meaning I look for a cross DOWN while MACD is already below zero level) Same thing, I also take the trade when MACD is crossing down the zero level Of course, price action must be in correlation with the MACD (if MACD shows buy signal, Donchian trend must be green and price should be above the average channel; you know, the basic thing mentioned on page 1).

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Thanks my friend, sorry for late answer. We are very similar dear JPNtrader as character. I am following the ALI dictat but i saw sometimes, for example the daily time frame i closed this week in lost, at some point they were in profit but i tried to fight my istinct to close the trade as ALI advice us but at the end waiting, i closed all three trades in lost.(all 3 at some point in profit but reverted in lost changing color of the candle) I will try to use 1h even if i think is full of noise that timeframe but not sure. It may be i will try both 1h and 4h. I have big indecision if set a fixed take profit (the only reason is the fear of revert and loose if at some point in profit the trade) How are you doing the back test? I ask this because if you work on old chart the they are not so reliable or, i expain better: The MACD repaint so what you see on old chart is not the same MACD of the instant you dive in the trade. Do you use programming language to backtest the strategy? I can program in python. I wll try to back test the strategy and exit with fixed pips looking if it is so consitent as ALI rules (cut quicly the loos and surf the win) Thanks for youe time i appreciate your post and your way of thinking. Another trade on daily revert to lost. This week -3.5% on four trade, only one is still open (eurusd on daily) Sorry for my bad english. Paolo

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hi JPN, i know you are not posting image anymore but can you post an image just for teaching pourpose on the 2 type of crosses you cited above? Just to be sure if i understood well. Thanks Paolo

--- 帖子 #667 ---
This is probably just me but I don't think 1H has many noises. And it's just right when you are daytrading, and/or need an immediate feedback about your trading. I came from my experience of trading the seconds time frame and 1m time frame so I know what a "real" noise is (but again, market is fractal, the thing you see on 1m happens as well on 1D). For backtest, I don't use a specific software. I just use Tradingview. But since Tradingview cannot backtest heikin ashi candle, I use two layouts: left layout in heikin ashi, right layout in normal Japanese candle (that shows the same pairs, same time frame, same everything as the heikin ashi). I just run through the chart for the week, find any signal in the heikin ashi candle, then use the Japanese candle to place my buy/sell tool at the right spot (because in heikin ashi, we don't know where exactly is the price opening/closing). This way I could gather my backtesting data. You had a minus 3.5% out of four trade. Could you tell us where the entry point and SL for those trades? With a chart screenshot. A quick two examples of the types of trade I take. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The first one is when MACD crosses the zero level, and the candles are also showing the right color, and also in the right position (in this case, it's a buy scenario, signal candle is above the average channel) The second one is the scenario where MACD is already above/below the zero level. We see that candle is already below average channel, MACD is also already below the zero level, and there is a cross down on the MACD. If MACD crosses up while it is still below zero level, I won't take the trade. In fact, for the second scenario, in my rule I would not take this. I only take trades where the signal candle is the first or the second candle that changes color. In this one, it's already the third one. Hope this clarifies!

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi Jpntrader, I tried to emulate your very neat and organized chart as much as mt4 will allow, you are absolutely right with regard to having both HA and classic candlestick charts side by side coz the HA does not tell you the Open/ close information unless you overlay the OHLC bar on top. So the first trade is after the second HA candle which is right after the macd cross above zero, so perfect timing. The second trade however you placed your line on the third candle but the crossing below the zero happened one candle before(dotted line), so the entry would have been there, right? thanks again for all your input and sharing your mindset when trading, much appreciated. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) A few days down the road the signal candle shown on HA would not have been a good entry despite the perfect macd above zero crossing ( see the classic candle chart). A better entry would have been 4 candles later (dotted line). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello lbtrader "you are absolutely right with regard to having both HA and classic candlestick charts side by side coz the HA does not tell you the Open/ close information unless you overlay the OHLC bar on top." Yeah this is the exact reason. That's why there are lots of times where in HA candle, it seems like the price just pulled back a bit, but in reality (in Japanese candle) SL was already hit "The second trade however you placed your line on the third candle but the crossing below the zero happened one candle before(dotted line), so the entry would have been there, right?" Aah.. I might have made a mistake. Yes I think if I zoom in, the MACD down-cross actually happened one candle before, which is the second candle that changes color, but the cross is so subtle that I didn't see it. Therefore, it is a valid trade. Thank you for correcting me! But yeah, if the MACD cross happen but the candle is already the third one that changes color, almost every time I would skip the trade. A few days down the road the signal candle shown on HA would not have been a good entry despite the perfect macd above zero crossing Attached Image (click to enlarge) For me, I would not take it if the candle does not break the average channel, no matter how good the MACD cross is. Experience taught me the hard way

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Not only that, but the DC (sorry not shown here)was still bearish, so absolutely right, on the 4 th candle it turns bullish and the trade would be with the trend.

Hello all, I’m enjoying working my way through this strategy and backtesting it - but I’ve noticed that the exit rule of waiting for a colour change leaves a lot of pips on the table as candles retrace in the second half of the hour (I trade off the 1 hour timeframe). I presume the logic of this is that waiting for the colour change is a way to stay in trades longer so you recoup your lost pips when there is a long trend. What are people’s views about the exit rules? Are most of you trading the strategy as written or are there any of you trying alternative exit rules?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
I like this strategy on the H1. I like to have an alert on the cross so I am using another macd which makes it easier to see the cross. Last week I was using it on a separate account to try it out. These were my stats from Friday 30th September till Thursday 6th October. Not a huge sample but a very good start. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I need to rebuild my credibility at my eys of myself. I though the behavioural lesson of ALI and a rigorous method would help me...i keep fighting. I will do my back test as you wrote, great method yours of using both configuration (HA and normal candles) here my 3 lost of this week: vertical red line was my entry, exit on change color very bad week! last week 2 win 3 lost this week this three lost and one still open, all on daily Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) thanks JPN i will keep following your experience and smart advice.

If a boss like you had a week so and so a scarse trader as me can be happy to have lost only 3.5% Why are you making more than 5 trades per week? just because it is FOMC race or because you are the real boss and can make whatever you want? Simple curiosity Thanks for sharing Paolo

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hi Big Kev, this is a good question. Honestly I had the same question mark in my head as well. Your logic is correct. This system is designed to minimize loss and to ride the trend when there is a long one. But reading the way you said "candle retrace in the second half of the hour", correct me if I'm wrong but I assume you close your position when candle changes color BUT have not closed yet? Because the decision to close a position is to wait until the candle closes first. Also the introduction of 5 EMA can help you a lot. If you're in a position then candle changes color but does NOT break the 5 EMA, it could continue to your direction. Only when candle changes color, closes while breaking the 5 EMA, that you close your position. As for the alternative exit rules, as I have said before in this thread, I am now setting a fixed pips SL and TP in every trade I take. But this will deviate from the original system Ali is sharing us, so I will respect him and will not discuss about it.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi Paolo, Ahh, I understand what caused those trades to be losses. From this whole conversation, we know that there are two types of setup: A+ setup: when candles align with the Donchian and average channel, MACD crosses, AND it also crosses over the zero level B setup: the one that you had with all those trades; the MACD crosses but did not cross over the zero level Pardon me for the random naming of the setups. Ali actually did give you the advice: only take the A+ setup! In your case here, you were simply in the wrong side and timing of the market, not because you misinterpret the system. And if you want, you could follow my way as well on post #664 : if MACD is above the zero level, only look for buys. If it is below the zero level, only look for sells. Of course the candles + Donchian + average channel must align as well.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Yes of course. This is the one I am using. When the macd crosses it shows red or green. It makes it easier for me to see how long ago the cross was and then I just have to look at when its near or crossing the zero line. By the way, once there is a signal, I switch to m5 to make sure its not due a pullback first.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I also think the support and resistance on this system is very very good and thats how I treat it. I mark on H1 the H4 and D1 lines to be sure I am not going to run into something on a higher timeframe before I take the trade.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Thanks JPN. You’ve been a huge help. I’ve been closing my positions at the close of the candle, as per the rules. What I meant was more the observation that I’ve seen some quite big retracements go against me in the second half of the hour candle, so you’re sitting there watching your pips drain away! I think I might be a man after your own heart in terms of trading psychology - ie I don’t like watching drawdowns so maybe a fixed TP might be more my style.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I don't wait for an opposite colour to close, I come out if there is a reversal APB (wicks both top and bottom) even if its the same colour I will come out at its close, especially if the macd has also crossed.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Now I get what you meant, sorry for the misunderstanding. Yup, at the end of the day trading system should follow your character and your life circumstance, not the other way around. You can try back/forward testing the fixed pips system to see if it really suits you. (Psstt... 15 pips SL/30 pips TP on 1H, 30 pips SL/60 pips TP on 4H on major pair besides the JPY pair, might work) Did anybody hear a "psstt" or anything? No? Just me? Okay then let's move on with our day. Have a nice weekend, everyone.

The 7 Principles of Consistency Mark Douglas talks about 7 principles which help beginning traders develop into consistent winners over time. The following are his list of guiding principles… 1. I objectively identify my edges 2. I predefine the risk of every trade 3. I completely accept the risk or I am willing to let go of the trade 4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation 5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me 6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors 7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles. I never violate them.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Eliminate the Emotional Risk Thinking in terms of probabilities also helps remove the emotional risk of trading. Mark Douglas talks about the 5 Fundamental Truths, they are as follows… 1. Anything can happen 2. You don’t need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money 3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another 5. Every moment in the market is unique

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Think in Sample Sizes It is extremely important to look at the markets in terms of probabilities. This will help you understand your edge and calm your emotions from trade to trade. I like to think in sample sizes of 20 trades. Rather than look at my profit/loss for the day or week, I monitor my p/l in ticks for the last 20 trades. Each individual trade you make is simply one of thousands of trades that you will make over the course of your trading. If you keep this in mind and limit your risk on every trade then mentally there is no need to fret over one or two losing trades, or even a string of losing trades. Monitor your last 20 trades. What is your worst string of 20 trades? What is your best string of 20 trades? The numbers may surprise you.

I am back- testing 25 Pairs, mostly uncorrelated. TF: H12 R=2% September. Rules: Entry: as stated on page 1, exactly. Exit: No hard close on candle color, instead, move the stop to above/below that candle. Move the stop again on the next adverse color candle if the market kept running in my favor. Inside candles with color changes are ignored. Not finished yet, but the first 8 trades gave a whopping: 25% growth. 88% winning rate. 1,86 Expectancy. H12 is easy to control, no sleeping with open trades, the only danger is the Sunday night open (EU), with the known gaps and spread spikes. Here´s the excel file. (will update once the Backtest is finished). Have a great Sunday. (Btw. I have a few open now, with real money, all but one in profit.)

Sorry, FF does not let me upload the simple excel file, too big???

H12, Being twelve hour time frame correct?

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Finished back-testing. Results are more sobering: 11% 42% winners. 0,22 Expectancy 24 Trades Unexpectedly, using a Stochastic/Rsi filter on the 2,5 Days (half a week). 18% 88% winners. Only 8 trades. Clearly better, filtering. My guess is people can use the filter that suits them best: Fibos, trend lines, SR, Planetary cycles... The key is that the basic strategy works. Both back-tests were positive. Even 11% is an excellent performance. Compound it triples the account in a year. Btw. I was using Oanda , one of the brokers I have, where you can calculate the risk to the cent. Not that they are my favorite broker, brutal spreads . Happy Sunday

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Thank you for your hard work during backtesting. Please, would you be so kind and will tell us more about Stochastic/Rsi filtering in the 2,5 days? It is hard to imagine for me, what you mean exactly. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
"Exit: No hard close on candle color, instead, move the stop to above/below that candle." This is giving a new perspective. Thanks man. Do you move the stop above/below the candle that changes color only , or do you do that as well to candles going your direction? You know, to trail the position once it has gained quite the pip amount.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Hello all, Wondering if anyone else here is having the same thoughts as me? Maybe because the entry rules are so straightforward, I find myself taking too many trades in my back testing - good ones and bad ones. So I catch some very good ones but give too many pips back with bad ones. Posts tend to concentrate on entered trades - but equally important in any system is learning which trades NOT to take. And that’s the part I’m still struggling with. Can I ask that people also post the trades that they don’t take? The ones that meet the entry rules but that you filter out with experience? And post the reasons why. Because that’s the knowledge that could help turn a good system into a great one for me and I suspect for others. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #709 ---
You must be sick of me at this point.. Apologies but I have to raise my hand again. I mentioned this on my post #664 . To recap: If we want to buy, Donchian must be green, price must be above the average channel, and MACD must cross UP, right? MACD is the key for me. If the cross up happens while it is still below zero level, I won't take it. I only take it if MACD crosses up AND crosses the zero level as well (or it touches the zero level when crossing up). The reason? Hmm to me, above the zero level is the buy zone. Below zero level is the sell zone. So, MACD crossing up but still in the sell zone is not a valid signal for me, no matter what the rest of the indicators tell you. Also, on 1H and 4H, when the signal candle is a news candle, I won't take it no matter how valid the signal is. News candle, especially on NFP, CPI, FOMC, is very very impulsive that it leaves what is called an "imbalance" (it's a term from a different trading style). The reason? Usually several candles after that would retrace deeply to fill that impulsive candle (the imbalance) first. The second reason is a day after those news I mentioned above, the affected pairs usually move slowly. I don't want to be involved in that kind of situation.

Hi ALI in the post #6 folllowing this your image you wrote: https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...l?d=1659366689 if your win rate around 50% only you will make money because winner more bigger than losers in the example of this loser setup i will go out before hitting st because the ap candle color change so if you risk 1% you may losse in this trade 0.5% and this winner may give you around 2 % gain here my question: when you close the trade before hitting the SL did you wait the candle close or as soon the candle changed color you closed the trade? Thanks Paolo

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I'm sure it would have to be when the bar closes a different colour, open candles can change from one colour to another so until its closed you don't know how its going to close.

When candle close in different colour

--- 帖子 #713 ---
-Candles moving in my direction, 3 candle stop, no inside bars counted. (but I also try to avoid setting stops at obvious stop run levels)

--- 帖子 #714 ---
My humble 2 cents about this system. - It works! (thanks again Ali). PROVIDED one respects the rules. Like Ali says, this is just a mind game. Interestingly, the original famous Turtle System, was a test made on newbies, decades ago, aiming to prove, that although the system was solid, hardly anybody would follow the rules or make money. Also important, if you have a basket of 10 or 20 pairs, you must make sure you don´t miss any opportunity. Already those days, just missing one trade (the test lasted for a year, some trades for months), would make or break the result!!! In my opinion, the key ingredients combination of: Donchian for trend, MA for stop, and Heiken-colored candles has the virtue of avoiding (mostly) the dreaded STOP RUNS. The whole FOREX is run by 5 or 6 very Big Banks , with the best software, hundreds of programmers, the best hardware, and lots of cash (LOTS). Their only purpose is, of course, to make $, which they extract from: retailers, and semi-big players. They literally make hundreds of millions per day. EURUSD is by far the biggest market traded daily. Many times bigger than the whole Stock Market, you can Google the numbers. So basically, the only chance for us retailers is to piggy-bag on the trends generated by the Big boys and follow them. Back- testing is crucial if you want to use any filter. Ideally at least 100 trades. Again, Ali does that, that is also another reason why he is profitable!

Didn't know about the system was originally a test on newbies! Corrrrrrrrect. Agree 110% on this. Michael Douglas on his book "Trading in the Zone" said this: Anything can happen. You don’t need to know what is going to happen next to make money. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. Every moment in the market is unique. I am emphasizing on number 3. In Ali's system, we KNOW that the system is profitable, we KNOW that the win rate is around 60% (and winners are bigger than the losers), but we DON'T know when it will win and when it will lose. How do we overcome that? By taking every signal that presents itself to you! (Making your sample size larger and larger) Really, after you have a full comprehension of the system (which don't take a long time), it's just a mind game and a probability game.

Hello Bruno I assume the red vertical line is the signal candle? This is a great trade. But for me, I probably would not take it because the signal candle is the third candle already that changes color. Quoting a late forexfactory member on the thread "Trading Made Simple" (eelfranz), it is said that heikin ashi/APB candle averages about 3-8 candles after it changes color. So, if the signal candle is already the third one, it's safer if we do not take it. ( exception if the first candle is an indecision candle : a nearly nonexistent body and very very long wick above and below. In this case I would take the trade.) Even when the red line is actually your entry (meaning the signal candle is the second blue candle there), I would probably still not take it because candle body hasn't broken the 5 EMA yet. Me too, have just migrated from 1H to 4H due to day job that is getting more demanding. Let's do this together, Bruno.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Jpn did you try 12 H or 8 H ? To me, the problem with 4 H is leaving candles open whilst asleep! I remember reading a lot about eelfranz, (I think he passed away.. ). He used to put the alarm clock in the middle of the night to check his 4H candles. 12 H gives you fewer opportunities, BUT you can increase the number of pairs. At the moment I am setting up some Commodities, Sugar, Wheat, Bonds, etc. They are less correlated to Forex and less correlated to each other. They do have weird trading hours though.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I thought this might help some people that are not used to Synergy APB candles, they are explained by the man that designed them. Also I have attached the synergy pro apb that he talks about a bit later in the video, I don't like using the PAC that comes with that but I change the colour yellow into none under inputs.

Moving to 4HR candles. Interesting. I’ve thought about that but I wonder if we live in the wrong time zone? My candles are 8AM, midday, 4PM, 8PM, midnight and 4AM. So in reality only 2 of those candles (8PM and midnight) would show significant movement and be tradeable. The rest are either Asian session (no movement) or while I’m asleep. Finding the best TF to trade as an Australian-based trader is certainly a conundrum.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Haven't tried that! I do the charting on Tradingview, and in november the pro license is going to expire so I will lose the ability to see custom time frames.. So if not 4H, I think the jump I will make is going to be straight to the daily TF. On 8H and 12H, does this mean the opportunity to monitor your trade will always be during your awake state? So even you sleep for 9 hours straight, it won't be a problem? I am sure as well that there will be less opportunities, but when you are in a trade, it must feel like there isn't any because it doesn't interrupt your day. Therefore, more calmed psychology. Yeah, I am still learning to bring a trade overnight. There is this one trade this week that made me feel uneasy at midnight.. Kept having shallow sleeps, got awake for several times at around 2-4 AM because I suddenly thought "did the trade hit SL?? Should I check my phone in case it's time to set BE??" But I managed to let it go, and checked the trade the morning after. Quite the character development for me, eh? Haha. Yes, eelfranz passed away in 2012, and I think he needed to wake up in the middle of the night to take medication or so. Rest in peace, Eric Eelfranz. Your education really brought us together.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
One question.. Is APB different from heikin ashi? Please educate me.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Big Kev, that means 8PM is after London open, and midnight is after NY open? In November, the western world is going to enter daylight saving time, right? That means the candle will be 9AM, 1PM, 9PM, and 1AM. This should give you an extra candle to trade from (9AM-1PM-9PM candle)

To ALI or to JPN (the more aknowledged here..) Sorry but i have a big doubt on a basic In post #5, ALi wrote : " when blue crosse red above zero level of macd that more consertive" Does it mean that if the cross happens BEFORE both blue and red cross the zero line the trade is better? (more conservative)? I attach the draw of post #5 of ALI Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here my confusion, here what i understood 1. cross red blue exactly on zero line is A+ trade 2. The question i wrote before: if the cross happens in SELL (above zero line) as in the picture is good or not and viceversa in BUY (below zero line)? Thanks Paolo

--- 帖子 #699 ---
here another picture of ALI Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here in the above picture In the The win trade marked by ALI, the the cross happened al lot above zero. Have i to consider this setup? If yes is there a rule? Ok i undestood A+ setup but some of you in some post consider also this cross very above or below zero line... Thanks for help Paolo

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi Paolo You understood properly, that is the way I do it too. Ali also mentions different triggers for more experienced traders. I understand JPN only uses triggers above or below the 0 levels. Again, you need to find the pizza that tastes the best to your palate. All the best.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
No need to apologize, Paolo. I totally understand your concern. We need to make sure the detail as this will determine our judgement. If we are SELLING but the MACD cross happens while it's still ABOVE zero level, for me personally, I would not take it. Back to your example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) See the second trade, where we are selling but the MACD cross is still above zero level? That trade ended up in profit but I think it's a smaller one. You know, the thing is, sometimes this scenario works (like your example), sometimes it doesn't. That's why Ali is incorporating every signal the system has, to prepare ourselves when it actually works. Ali takes this signal, but I don't, but we both are still in this Turtle System together. So the question now is, how about you, right? Let's see, can you backtest this "selling while MACD is still above zero level" thing, and see the outcome for yourself? That way, you can actually determine if this type of setup is suitable for you or not. That's the only way to find out if a system is for you or not: try it yourself! I am where I am today with this system because I have spent countless hours to determine which part of this turtle system actually goes well with me, cuchuflito said it perfectly: you need to find the pizza that tastes the best to your palate! Ali and me are eating at the same pizza store, but he likes pepperoni while I like cheese, but again it's the same pizza store!

Since I started the 12H, one position test , with real money some 10 days ago, I have a small realized profit, 5 open positions with one slightly in the red, one still running with a big profit, and another one with a very decent one.

Review of the week: This is the second week I moved from 1H to 4H entries; but still pretty much doing daytrading because I use fixed pips. All I can say is, I really enjoy the ability of taking a trade without being glued to the screen; my performance in my day job increases, and I have better quality of life because I have less screen time. I tried to turn on my trade explorer on forexfactory, but seems like my whole year worth of performance is included and I can't disable it, so I deleted it again. (my trading life was quite awful before I discovered "Trading Made Simple" and this system, so I am shy about it and don't want to display it. I'll probably create a new MT4/5 account to track my performance purely with this system next year haha.) But for this week, on my personal account I gained around 7.5% with 8 trades: 2 consecutive losses and 6 wins. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The last 4 trades were executed at the same time; so I divided the risk (basket trading). Also I reached quite a big milestone this week: I have been trading with Stocknet Institute (that prop firm where you get instant funding without evaluation), and using this system, I managed to achieve my first 10% profit and received account scale-up from $1,250 to $2,500, and also withdrew my first payout with them. Thank you Ali for providing us this system and really gave me the light bulb above my head. Thank you Eric "eelfranz" from the thread " Trading Made Simple " that opened my way this year. Rest in peace, sir. Have a peaceful weekend, everyone.

Thanks cuchuflito for sharing. I will be watching/trading the 12H charts too, they look smoother and MT5 has it built in so no need to add another indicator and use offline charts, only problem I cannot find the turtle channel indicator for MT5, anyone has any idea?

Tks as always and clear as always, you are using the entry SELL if the cross blue/red is already in selling zone (oversold with othe indi), below zero. This is what i consider "conservative" using ALI terminology...i am in the middle: i will use (beginner tecnique) cross red/blue on zero all together or if i find some set up your. Until now when i found setup with cross above zero (in selling) i finished BAD. I take advange to clearing another doubt about backtesting: I am with you backtesting help to find your way to trade but the setup live is different from the same setup studied a day after. Live it happend to me i have all perfect: cross red/blue on zero or cross red/blue above (buy) or below (sell) zero, enterend in the trade as new candle open, channell ok but after some hour (in 4h or daily) the MACD component has been repainted. On the back test all is set so it is esier to find the set up Summing up what i want to say is from live trading to backtesting trading there is anther piece of uncertainty, something i cannot calculate. Hope to be clear.... But working as you said on backtesting help you find and clear your tecnique. This forum, and you mates are helping a lot to become a better trader. Have a good weekend Paolo

UPDATE All positions closed, the news today created a big spike in some pairs and stopped me out unexpectedly on 3 decent trades, that turned red. RESULTS: 11 Trades in less than 2 weeks. 6% profit risking 2% (exactly), per trade. 55% win rate. Not bad at all to say the least. I follow the entry rules on page 1. But then I trail, (not close), after the first color change against me. Btw. I had a EURHKD open and did not realize it is almost 100% correlated to EURUSD, so I got hit double. So EURHKDis deleted from my list. Without that mistake, it would have ended on a 60% win rate and 7% account growth. I had only 1 fat winner, with a 4,2 R. All the other winners were less than 1 R. I did follow my rules on every single trade. That shows the importance of not missing trades, and avoiding mistakes. The market does not forgive mistakes. You all have a fantastic weekend.

I see, so that is one of the problem.. Hmm I'm sorry that I'm not able to answer that because I use Tradingview as my charting tool and repainting problem does not happen there.. Let's do this together. The system is good, we just have to take time to tweak the system for us. Not an easy path (for me as well) but it'll be worth it once it clicks . I promise that.

Tends to happen on Friday but I'm glad for your result. Your trailing system is actually good, I would have followed that if I were still following the vanilla, original system. By the way, I have taken a look at 12H and 8H candles. Might work with the way I do things now, but sadly the candle forms at awkward times in my place (12H candles are 6AM and 6PM; the 6AM one is hard + it is spread hours. 8H is a bit better though.)

Great job in all of you i see.... I am using the weekend to improve the understanding what ALI call " market condition", reading a good book (the art and science of tech analysis -Grimes) A question to our Guru: When you draw a support or a resistence or a trend line on our set up (APB candle) you draw it on the top of the wick or on the close of the candle? because the pure theory (on normal candle) says we have to draw the lines on the close but here with APB is different. On the draw Of ALI or others of you in this thread is not clear. Thanks everybody. Paolo

Remember my charts are 12 H USDCHF turned north as expected, I did not take it, my other filters were negative. It would have been a BE at best.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Here is AUDUSD 12 H It has a negative or inverted diversion (blue lines), my filter: a 2,5 Day chart (half a week chart), and momentum indicators are not AA, but reasonable. Also, there is a stop run. I might consider a short when that new 12 H bar closes, tonight, before bedtime. Aussie, Cable, Eurusd, Jappy, they are fully infected with Stop runs created by the Big Boys . Actually, the whole market is, but the majors have more "retailer meat" for them, and their software just plays the game, day in and day out.

I went through the first pages of "Trading made simple", and found how interesting the TDI indicator can be. Considering that system is known for being profitable, I decided to merge both and back-test them, being similar. Just for kicks, I took the trades I mentioned on post 750, and back-tested the same results, BUT adding on every trade a second entry using the TDI. Some losing trades got the TDI never triggered , and some did. All winners did get both triggered. Results, just as I thought. Close to double the profit, better win rate. 6% account increase, almost 11% account increase with both triggers. As known, this trading game is a combination of mind, math, back-testing, and experience.

--- 帖子 #770 ---

Sorry I posted the wrong picture. This is the correct picture I wanted to share. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here's an H4 chart on EU with MACD and TDI. I believe TDI can be useful in keeping you in the trade when the HA candles turn to the opposite color, however as you can see, most of the time the signals are in agreement on both, but still some discrepancies. on 1 the entry based on MACD is against the turtle, they both agree on 2 but that's 5 candles down. mid way the three blue candles would have prompted you to exit, however the TDI is still below 50 so? stay in the trade and exit on 3?( or mayber safer on the first of the 3 blue candles) 4 is not a good entry on such a giant candle, the better entry is on 5 and exit on 6. Here TDI is still above 50 but MACD already crossed 0, if you don't exit you're stopped out on the big red candle just before 7. 7 is a new entry and both are in agreement with good profit. the more indicators you put, the more confusion you add to your decisions I think. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I don´t see the TDI you mentioned.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
The second picture I sent has the TDI on the bottom of the indicators. My TDI has the bolinger bands on it.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Sure, maybe this clarifies. Scaling in, as opposed to scaling out right? Scaling out works against your bottom line, cause your best winner has only half a load, but your losers have a double load. Different if you consider them as 2 separate systems that generate a signal. But scaling in, your best winners will mostly have a double or triple load, and most of your losers only 1. This is why my backtest on those 6 trades I took, gave almost a double profit. It was a typical 10-day period, with one big winner, a couple of small winners, a couple of small losers. First I want to clarify, my intention is to trade the Turtle system as per the original entry rules. _This is the EURJPY 12 H chart I took with the MACD trigger. (I exited on that thumbs up, I have a rule that once the top of EW gets penetrated I trail 1 bar behind.) But my exit is another story. -Now as you can see, a few bars after the MACD triggered, TDI triggered also. Both were profitable. Now if in the middle I would have had a red bar, I would have moved my stop right below that bar. -If I would have gotten a red bar before the TDI triggered, I would have done the same, only on 1 open position. You just dance with the market. Another thing I do is after the first entry, the market retraces against me but does not stop me, I move to the 4-hour, and if I get a Macd signal there, hopefully, cheaper, I will enter again, having 2 positions.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Thank you for the clarity. Mr. Robert

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi cuchuflito, It seems that you are using the original donchian channel indicator rather than the turtle indicator. I tried to emulate your 12H chart with the MACD and TDI The first trigger was actually against the turtle trend. The second trigger TDI slightly precedes the MACD dip and continuation, so they both are in agreement. and btw, this TDI you’re using is a special version, unlike the original red-green TDI posted by big E in his thread. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #782 ---
the reasons why i took this trade in the chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Hola I am actually using the indicators and templates from both threads, nothing changed (except for the black background). Small Turtle trend is defined by Donchian Channell, correct? It was blue. I don´t enter waiting for both systems/indicators to be aligned. That would mean creating a new entry rule. Guess one could create a new System: "The Double Turtle" or something, where you only enter when both agree, one would need to back-test that. As I said, I enter my first position strictly by "The small Turtle" guidelines. (I do use other personal filters, but that is another story). AFTER that, and ONLY IF, I get a TDI trigger I will take it, and add a second position. Hope this clarifies.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Thank you cuchuflito for clarifying your thinking, I am beginning to see the worth of the higher TF, especially the 12H and 2.5 day, hopefully I will post some setups in the near future, as they are not too many as you mentioned. It’s true, however it is a modified version in the sense that it shows red for the downtrend and blue for the uptrend with skip between the two, you do not see a continuous line, in the pictures I showed, the upper one uses the regular DC and the lower one uses the small turtle. As you can see, the turtle was in red when MACD triggered. I trade countertrend many times, I use RSI as my filter for that.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
OANDA has on "Advanced Charting" (Tradeview) and MT4 slightly different 12H charts. I am long on GBPAUD, MT4 shows the last Heiken candle red , Advanced charting green . So I moved my stop 2 candles before, where both agree, the difference is minor. Btw. when I move my stops on color changes, I do look at obvious Stop Run levels and move the stop accordingly, to avoid (hopefully), getting bit by the Big Boys. By far the most frustrating experience for us traders is to get Stop Ran by "The Big Mother F...." only to see them run with our money in the original direction.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is my setup today that I took. Several opportunities. I did add the TDI although it is not part of the original game plan with this strategy. I am in long position on the 4H timeframe. TDI is getting close to being overbought, however we all know how price can still run! LOL Let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
This is exactly what happened with EJ, the two giant stop hunts and then trend continued up as before the two candles

--- 帖子 #788 ---
I think we're in the same trade

--- 帖子 #789 ---
here is my follow up from my earlier trade with the GBPCHF. I did wait for the crossover TDI before I exited as mentioned on previous threads. I did not wait til the end of the hour. Once the TDI crossed within the hour I was out. Price did run as high as 23 pips on this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Here is what happens when one is not patient enough. Literally closed the GBPCHF trade with 15 minutes to go on the hour with a red candlestick up a few pips. Once the hour closed in 15 minutes the candle went from red to green. Now the price continues higher. Goes back to what Ali has said multiple times please be patient with Attached Image (click to enlarge) our trades!

i want to give great advice for new traders when you began trading began small because you will lost your acount in learning when you get consistent profit for 6 months you can increase your account one of the obstacles that face the trader, the quick profit and the rush to success, do not fall into them, take your time be very small until you learn good and can depend in yourself no one will tell you this

--- 帖子 #793 ---
The other way around for me! After that glorious last week, I'm in minus by around 1% so far (1 loss and 1 BE). This week to me market didn't show many signals, or there were conflicting signals between pairs that have positive correlation. So I chose to stay on the sideline. I notice that this kind of condition tends to happen at the end of the month so that's probably it.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
This something that I have been doing lately, and what I call a "delayed entry" on 4H time frame. Not something that is mind blowing or anything, but I personally just noticed this some times ago and began doing it. The original rule is when a signal candle appears, we enter one candle after that signal candle closes, right. If we enter 2-3 candles after that, it could be too late already. My "delayed entry" (such a bad naming) ensures that we can enter 2-3 candles after the signal shows up. Remember this is on 4H time frame. Also, it suits more for people who lives in Asia/Australia since this involves NY session which happens at midnight in those zones. This is how it works: 4H signal candle appears an hour after NY session opens (10PM Japan time, convert that to your time). An hour after that, usually all news are released for the session, and market will go through low volumes as it approaches NY close, spread hours, and the beginning of Asian session. If 2-3 candles have formed (meaning until around 9-10AM the next day, Japan time) and price still lingers around the original entry point, I would enter the trade at or above/below the original entry point for better position. If price indeed wants to go to your direction, you'll be having a nice trade. I'll give one example of this. Left is heikin ashi candle, right is normal Japanese candlestick. Pay attention to the right layout. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You see, after the signal shows up at 10 PM, price is entering NY close - spread hours - Asia open (ultimate combination for low volumes), but still having the will to go bullish. We execute the trade 2-3 candles after the signal, that usually are considered "too late", but still turns out to be a successful one. Hence, "delayed entry". Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Aah man I'm sorry I just saw this. The post went through. Okay so the indicators on Tradingview are: Supertrend instead of Donchian, but I don't use it anymore, however I believe the Supertrend settings are 3-3 I am using MACD that is mentioned on page 1 of this thread. But if you're going to use TDI, I use the one that is used by ASFX (that forex influencer on social media). The indicator name is ASFX TDI, settings are 21-32-2-7 (the original settings I guess?) The average channel, on tradingview it's called RV-34 For me, average channel is enough to tell direction and momentum, that's why I don't use Supertrend (Donchian) anymore.

I am using trailing SL but sometimes it makes me out of the trade too soon And If I don't use trailing SL or don't move SL, sometimes it's reverse

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Thank you jpntrader for your insight, however the price after the first rally candle did not go back to the open price (it retraced to just below the 50 fibo level), sort of catching it's breath and consolidating for 3 candles, accumulating orders for the second rally, and this is showing on the dip in MACD which I consider as a pullback and continuation. Some would use this (like cuchuflito in a previous post) as a scaling in adding another lot to the first lot that was triggered on the initial MACD and candle signal, but if that candle was too big and the SL would be too much then the first trade or "the delayed entry" would be after the consolidation and continuation of the rally. Hope this makes sense. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Same for me, but then this is the time to be ready , we cannot afford to lose that big fat trade waiting somewhere, that will make the whole difference. Once I read this from a top trader: There are 2 types of trades only. - Good trades , you followed the rules (win or lose). - Bad trades, you did not follow the rules (win or lose).

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hi man! Thank you for clarifying this. I tried to look again at my chart and your chart. I think for me, the signal candle is the candle where the macd crosses completely for the first time, hence, this candle is the signal candle for me. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But I totally get what you meant! That's a great thought. Even though if the example I mentioned here was the wrong one, the concept is still the same. I got a nice trade on CHFJPY today, using this same principle (the "delayed entry") Please ignore my self note on the upper screen haha. Attached Image (click to enlarge) My minus 1% this week turned positive with this. Unfortunately I entered the wrong lot size; only got 1.5%-ish profit but it's still great.

I'm ending the week with -0.3% (4 trades: 1 win, 2 losses, 1 BE). Not much opportunities presenting itself for me this week. And since October 31 falls on Monday and usually there is no trade on Monday, I guess it's safe to close the trading month now.

So, I am a normal corporate staff with (currently) a small trading account, and this turmoil that is happening in Japan-- rising price + rising tax + flat salary + weak yen-- damages my daily life pretty bad.

I do have a parallel system running, that does not include Donchian. But that is another story.

Backtested M30 1 week (granted not much, but just to get a feel): EURGBP EURUSD Both are not correlated on M30. Results: Only 7 trades met my filters and strict S.Turtle entry. 4 Winners (2 over 2R). 3 losers (only 1 full -1R) , the others very small. 0,77 Expectancy which is very good. 6% growth risking 1% per trade, which is close to dreamland. Btw. as usual, miss those 2 winners and you spoil the whole week´s performance.

I felt the same. May be the SnR, Trends were mentioned at the beginning, but for the ease of other trader to follow, it was simplified. Now start picking up again the SnR part which has long been neglected. As for now, I don't see the candle color change, MACD cross 0 entry. It got me thinking, is it important to follow the rules?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
"as usual, miss those 2 winners and you spoil the whole week´s performance. " The exact reason I moved from 1H to 4H. You need to execute all signals shown by this system to be able to succeed. Miss one or two trades, your week could be ruined. Happened a lot to me on 1H. Even on 4H, on days when I need to go to the office, I would just go to the toilet 1-2 times a day pretending to do my stomach unloading activity while in reality I check for any possible trade on my phone. Which is hard seeing it on a small screen.

It is not just a matter of important or not, but important to you or not. I assume Ali used to be a price action trader before going with this system. He made this thread to help those who are new to the industry. But for those who are experienced, you can analyze price action then execute the trade with the confirmation of this system (hybrid way, like Ali does). That way, you can further filter out bad trades. But I agree that we should, 80-90% of the time, post trades that are only analyzed using this system. I used to trade supply-demand with liquidity concept but now I don't think or analyze the chart at all before taking any trade. Just rely on this system.

This week was wild, wow. 4 consecutive losses then 1 win; bringing me down to minus 2% for the week. I don't usually trade a day after FOMC and before NFP, so probably this minus 2% is locked in already for the week. Well, it's probably the way the universe is bringing me down to the earth after several weeks of being in quite big profits. Safe trading, everyone.

Want to have a look at what is possible? How about 1000% in a month and more? People are doing that with real $. Guess sometimes we put a stop to ourselves. Check these people: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...8#post14208138 https://www.forexfactory.com/

Possible, indeed, and this is also an inspiration for all of us. But remember, do not compare your level 2 with someone else's level 10. Working my way to that level!

Hi Guys, bad week for me -1.5% on 5 trades 4H timeframes. Still not consistent in 1 month of practice. Getitng crazy! Looking back of my entry i am making psycological mistakes. I am in hurry to enter the traded because scared to loose the right oppurtunity. Later checking my trades i never made a perfect A+ entry -one time i entered on a soft cross on macd (almost orizzontal both lines) - one time the candle were small (no price action) - on time i entered on a cross for BUY below zero line... - on time no lucky I am getting crazy but it is the first time i recognize my partial mistake...Sometimes some luck may help! Can someone tell me how are calculated the 2 param of turtle channel 20 and 10? I means the system check 20 candle back which HA candle is the highest and keep drawing blue support line? I am getting confused. Can you how are drawn the two lines and when there the switch? Thanks. Have a nice we Paolo

Hi Today i have 2 trades on h1 timeframes.

Hello fellow from VN ))btw, good trade and congrats

--- 帖子 #841 ---
I notice nobody has answered you as yet so I will try. They are simply support and resistance. Once it is broken by a close underneath support/above resistance, a new line is printed. For example, if a red line - resistance - is closed above then a blue line is printed to show where the support is now.

Hi lynnc, tks for answering, use them as you said supper and resistence but can you know the param 20 and 10 to what do they corrispond? Tks again happy trading

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Mine here it just an outlet: it is frustrating sometimes see your trade open with positive P&amp;L, happyit is runnig for big earn and following ALI's system. A voice from inside at that moment tell me to bring home the earn but as school of self control and to stay consistent with the strategy of ALI i wait to get out not just before the color of APB candle change. The day after all the happyness has gone because i had to close the two trades (change color of APB) the day before i was tempted to close in positive territory, but now in lost. What i mean is Do you wait straight as ALI teached us the change of color or use a different exit? I know that if you break the rule of exit you do not have a milestone in all the trade but may be there something different for the exit. It may be i get frustrated because i am not still consistent and when i saw a lost or a win i am susceptible. Here two examples where i was in posititve but later i closed because lost the trade. (green line my entry, red line my exit) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks everybody Paolo

--- 帖子 #847 ---
I personally don't wait for a candle to close a different colour, I also don't think Ali does every time. I can see by his posts that he took 3% or something. I risk 1% and take 2% if its offered.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
From what I can see it changes colour if it goes below/above the price 20 candles back and the stop is if it goes higher/lower than the candle 10 candles back. Someone maybe can correct me if I am wrong.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Tks Lynnc, i appreciate your answer.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Seeing good results so far with the system. I've asked this previously but with no avail, how do you guys use the moving average channel in your trading? Thanks

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Tks lynnc, Ali on a while of winning trade do you wait ALWAYS the change of color? Lynnc if you are in the middle of a wiining trade but before 2%R you get out or wait? If someone else like JPNTrader or somebody wants to shere his thought i will be glad of it. Tks a lot p.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
It depends, if I am in the middle of a winning trade and it changes colour AND the macd crosses back the other way, then I will take it out, but it doesn't happen very often.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hi Paolo, I am no where close to JPN or Ali, but I can try. The reason is you took the crosses either very high or very low, not the A+ setups that would favor a winning trade (even that is not a guarantee, but still...), another fact is that although you took your trades with the channel color (sell on red and buy on blue) but check the overall trend. the USDNOK has been in an uptrend, so it would be prudent to take a long position, and if you short it then take a quick profit. the same goes for NZDUSD, it's been in an overall downtrend, so better wait for a short setup and if long then quick profit. The third thing you should look out for is what JPN does, look at the real candle when you place your trade. Check the NZDUSD, the cross happened on the first grey circle, which was red channel, so if you wait for the blue your trade should have been on the second grey circle, but instead you took it on the first yellow and exited on the second yellow. Notice the entry and exit real bars? one is bull and the other is bear (where was your entry? the top of the bar? where was your SL?) for my broker all the HA candles are still blue not red. I did not analyze the USDNOK because it's a mirror image of the NU. Attached Image (click to enlarge) hope this helps

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Traded 2 setups this week, (+.62R, +1R) While ending the week profitable, I still got alot of work to do. I missed lots of setups on the H4 chart. Like others have said, the strategy can only work if you execute all the setups that it gives. This will be my focus from now on. AUDJPY (H1) +.62R - closed due to candle closing above 5EMA Attached Image (click to enlarge) CADJPY (H4) +1R - This one hurts, close due to price being near support, would be up 4R if i had respected the rules of the system.

How are you doing people? I am in a minus once again for this week, this time is -4%, and it's caused by my own stupid mistake, haha. There is this one trade, done in a coffee shop right after office hour on a mind-demanding day, that made me enter wrong position. The thing is I was too fatigued that the moment I realized I entered too much lot, was when I got a notification that my SL was hit. Ahaha. Another trade managed to go to TP but I decided I would take a break for the week, and accept that minus. If this work condition still continues, I guess I would have to migrate one time frame higher once more, to the daily TF. Have a pleasant weekend, you guys. Don't be a fool like me!

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Thanks for answer and for my late thanks, great considerations your a news learning lesson for me. I need more patience and analysis on what Ali calls " Market condition". Hope to make a good week. At this time i have to trade open, let's see at the end of the week. Thanks again Ibtrader

Hi Jpntrader, thanks for sharing, for me was +1.5%. It may be lucky because all trade were open from monday and at that time i was BE, Thursday on CPI news all reverted t my favour...Thats why i say lucky . I need to become consistent by myself, off the market news....working and studying on that... Jpntrader can you share your exit system? I forgot your and lazy to go back reading old thread? I rememember you used also 5EMA to filter bad exit on the loss but i forgot if you follow at letter ALI system on win (when APB change color or not) or cut loss before. Tks for sharing PAolo

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hi Paolo, sorry it took some time for me to reply. Work condition is crazy right now, haha. Lucky is part of the trading activity! Haha. My exit when I was still trading the original system is the 5 EMA mainly. As long as it doesn't cross the 5 EMA, I would still be in. But now I am more to the fixed pips system, kind of suit me more.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Tks for answer, in loss trade i will use 5 EMA (as you) or if there is a change in color of APB but not crossing 5EMA i still stay in, in winning trade i have to find something suits better for me, yesterday happened again: i was up a lot i a trade (GBPUSD on 4H), but all revert and yesterday night i quit the trade in little loss...

Sorry for late answer my dear JPN trader, last week was + 0.5%, not much but last two weeks pretty better (BE and + 0.5%) This week +0.7% but still oper two trades. I am really working on my psycology and realizing until now i made big mistake. It is the first time i am feeling better with myself following rule. I am trying to study better the entry and exit studying Technical analysis for better setup on entry. For the exit i have big doubt if exit fix numbers of pips or % or follow the ALI rule at letter. I am opening my view trying to study "Trade made simple" system (Mr emmanuel7788 is great as you here, very open to help...) and PASR thread. Still long journey hoping to having discovered the best route. Thanks everybody for sharing Paolo

--- 帖子 #874 ---
I am looking for an indicator that measures the difference between HA close and HA open. This looks almost similar to RSI, let´s say between 0 and 100. And i am looking for extrem values where HA could change direction. Can anybody help? This should be an helpful indicator with Heiken Ashi.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Good to hear that you are getting better with this! It's a unique journey to each and one of us. Don't rush. This is the time where you should spend quite the hours in front of your screen. Take 2-3 systems that you think suit you. Backtest that and see the result, and compare them for yourself. Don't rush! Especially near the end of the year where trading volume is low and spread is high, take that time to really hone your system. 2023 will hopefully become the turning point for us! Could you explain more about what are you trying to achieve with this? Sounds interesting.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
By measuring the difference between Heiken Ashi open and HA close the indicator should behave like RSI going between o and 100. When difference gradually decrees this difference should come smaller and smaller and the indicator turns down. I can see after an high value of this indicator the breakingpoint could be interesting almost like a leading indicator. Eventually at the same time HA turns down. I don´t know.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Excellent work, Thanks for sharing this strategy. When i tried to back test before going to market i got some question in using the system, i am a beginner sorry if question looks dumb.... 1st one is the entry point, like for long ,MACD cross below 0 line before donchian turns green like picture below, is it still a valid entry? Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2nd is stop Loss, i ust 1xATR as stop Loss is it ok under this strategy Many thanks for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Hi Chemingdaog, Sorry for my not perfect english As you, i am on the way on learning, not an expert but i try to share what i learned here: - Ali strategy, expecialy for beginners, advice to entry on the cross on zero line (many example on the threads). Below it, it is at your own risk, It may be later after some months when we can understand the market dynamics better, we could do it, right now based on me, if i want to enter even not on zero line cross, as a gentle expert here (JpnTrader) on long for example, i enter on cross above and on short on cross below zero line. It is more safe. - You can you the stop loss you want, i use 1% as max stop loss of if i am on the screen at color change of the candle after it is closed and if the body of the candle is above (in short) or below (on long) 5 EMA. Hope to answer to your doubt. good trading. Paolo

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Thanks for sharing experience, I will try to modify what I did and back test again

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Been really quiet here, eh? I hope it's because everyone is fully understanding the system and now trying to be the very best of oneself. I still have one position left opened since last week but it's safe to say that I am closing my trading activity for the year. Not much happened in November (I ended up in small minus) and December (I think it's BE, market doesn't move that good). But what I have been doing lately is to prepare myself for 2023. I have now developed my own system based on this Small Turtle system, and from other supporting influences as well. I have now, pretty much, achieved the state where trading is "boring" and executing trades does not involve emotion anymore. Let's see if these mind transitions will translate to something good next year. At the end of the day, I just want to say thank you to Ali, the late sir Eric "eelfranz", and everyone here for the advices and lessons you gave me throughout 2022. 2022 was a year of transformation for my trading career. Improvement, although small and in the form of baby step, was clearly made. Now I will enjoy the holiday season and will not open Tradingview anymore until January. Merry Christmas to those who celebrate, happy new year and have a blessed holiday season!

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Hello everyone. 2022 trade session closed for me too. I saw four months before this page and learning this basic systems. Thanks to Ali for share this system. Last three months my account rise. Good luck to everyone for 2023. Good holiday.

Marry Christmas travel buddies, A special thank to ALI and jpntrader that are helping me to build a strong attitude to trading, expecialy psycological and with this system. Last month was for me up and down, i am close to BE, not loosing it is already a great result for me. Unfortunately, not as you my friend jpntrader, the trade moves a lot of emotions which is still difficult to control. I have still a lot of technical stuff in this system i have to set, first of all the exit. Do you jpntrader have built a better exit over all of just fixed pips? I am still fighting as told in last threds to discover new systems (TMS and PASR) but i have not a lot of time to study right now. I can program a bit in python and i want to write down a script which backtest the ALI enter rule, not to automate the trade but just to see the distribution of the results based on various entry rules (cross on zero line, cross above on long, cross below zero on short ecc.). I hope to find the time to concentrate on. I will update in case Happy Christmas to All Paolo

Hi duythang, it is not clear where you entered. What a silence here! ALso ALI, left us? Last week for me it has been little lost (-0.5%) on 4 trades this week still not to enter, not enought time to follow the market. I prefer stay out if i cannnot study and follow the market.

Do some of you have advice on other strategies to follow here in FF consistent and smart as Turtle system of ALI?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
The whole point of this system is to let the winners run and cut the losers early. The winrate of this system isn't great therefore won't work well with 1.5R fixed TP but the positive returns come from the occasional big wins and trailing the stops. Any mechanical trend following system is based on letting the winners run and cutting the losses early. FYI - I don't trade this system but have looked into it in the past.

Well done Bee-Hop, it's a shame that it stopped you at BE as it reached 25 pips shy of your TP at 2:1. If I am to be stopped out at BE, I would like to add at least +1 to feel that it's not a total loss

--- 帖子 #907 ---
I am doing a Live Demo with this strategy and using 0.01. I suppose with a 0.02 or greater, one could always take some profit at 1:1, set trade to BE and leave the remainder of the trade to run to TP. May go with 0.02 from next week. Have a great weekend.

Hello everyone, I have a doubt on money management of this system: Ali told us to risk 1% of our balance every trade and getting out on change colour candle and often he told here in the thread he was going out before hitting the SL My question is? How much leverage are you using on various TF to respect this rule without being hitted to early on stop kiss . If I use a big leveraging I risk to not filter noise. On 4h and daily which is the righ compromise to stay in ALI rules? Thanks Oaolo

--- 帖子 #917 ---
most of my lost trades i go out before hit stop loss after candle change my maximum stop loss in any trade should not more than 1 % and that happen when strong move happen against my trade and that help me to cut losses quickly and when the market give me chance to ride big move in my setup direction i will still in it to get big profit and that difficult pyschological to many traders to make that consistent most of trading system that cut losses quickly and let profit run make money but most of traders dont make that consistent trading is very simple no one know where the market move we only trade in the direction of trend to increase odds in our set ups and cut loses quickly and let winners run if any system allow you to achieve this equation and you have the perfect way of thinking in every trade you take you will be consistent profit nothing else but we like to complicate our way it take me long time to be consistent but after that i found it simple only Commitment to this simple rules and basics and try to focus in three or four pairs and you must know that there are some times you dont need to make anything because there is no setup dont try to change your strategy to find set up

--- 帖子 #918 ---
every trader when choose a system that suitable to him and be disciplined in taking the setups and exits will be consistent profit and will stop searching systems and go to forums you may go to platform tech to find a more simple and fast way to take your same setups not change them

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Dear Alihelmy, So nice to see you around, and I know you talked about this before, but I would like a reminder - psychologically, how do you stay in trades for long.. this part is extremely hard for me, as I see profit and get out before full potential (as you say - it is very tough to do..). Do you sometimes see price levels (ex: S/R, fib levels..) where you get out before, even without color change ? Thank you for your continuous support here

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Heey man how are you doing, nice seeing you again

--- 帖子 #507 ---
This question is one of the greatest question when you get to this level of thinking you know in yourself that is a problem here and it is hard to commitment to implement the rules so there is a problem in your way of thinking when i am in the trade so you need to change your way of thinking to be a combination between external and internal environment When you can resolve this problem you will be successful trader It the same question when someone tell doctor i want to lose weight but i cant be disciplined with diet and decreas meal size and make excersice In trading 90% of traders cant cut losses quickly the ego dont need to be wrong and it is hard to accept loses Every person have different way of thinking For myself when i am in trade i know that i cant control the market so when i take small lose i go out quickly to be ready when the market give me big movement i must think in this point that i must wait to take big profit to remove small loses and get some money I dont know when to go out so when Heiken ashi candle color change i go out with 3 situation Small lose Small win Big win So i should cut losses quickly to avoid big losses and try to wait when market move in my direction to get big win

Thanks for answering my big teacher and sorry for late answer. Just a quick doubt: You said: {quote} most of my lost trades i go out before hit stop loss after candle change But do you wait a new candle is born right? You do not exit until a new candle is born right? You do not exit when the colour change on the same live candle or yes? Sorry for stupid question but doubt remain Thanks again for great words and teaching . My experience on this system is improving and I am becoming better trader, from loosing I am at least breakin even every month consistently, I need to work more on entry rule and respect the rule every time Bye all Paolo

Ali, Japan Trader and all others diligently working with this fine thread. I have read it all now, have forex experience and really like this straightforward approach. While virtually all time frames are being being used by someone, this seems most suited to H4 and up, and I am attracted to the D1 having done some backtesting. As usual, working on the greater TFs brings a greater win rate but fewer entries. And I may add one or more additional filters to help things along. Wondering if any of you are primarily working with the D1 or D1 with occasional H4? My checking indicates that there will average about 1.2 (or more) entries per month per pair over a long view using D1. It also appears that averaging &gt;100 pips is quite likely on successful trades. If you watch as few as 8-10 pairs, and many do more, there is a strong potential to wrestle a significant number of pips out of the market each month. I see things are quieter on the forum now, but a number of you are still engaged, and I hope to hear from you as you can. Wishing Ali and all continued success and sending my thanks to all who have contributed to make this a successful thread. Bravo! FS

I am using D1 only and for your indication of 1,2 trades per minth, It depends on the your approach to the strategy: if you wait the cross of MACD Lines at zero line exactty It May be there Is a big reduction of the Number of the trades but if you start to read and understand the price action you can Easy fill 4 trades per week (not more for risk management reason)Personally i cannot avarage the pips earned, i am breaking even with this strategy, and still a lot of work ti do. There are a lot of thing we can do to improve this strategy but rhey are not only actions for this strategy but for all out trading FX approach ( check risks, greedy approach, being superficiale...ecc.) Bye all Paolo

Many thanks, Paolo, for your reply, thoughts and experience. You have made an excellent point on the MACD cross of the 0 line and impact on the number of trades. With respect, FS

Did u try H12, you get a good mix of more opportunity and less noise.H8 is also feasible,240 is a problem unless you want to wake up in the middle of the night to monitor trades.
