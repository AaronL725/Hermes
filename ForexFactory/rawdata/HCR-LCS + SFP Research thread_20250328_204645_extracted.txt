THIS THREAD IS NOW ON HOLD. Ghous opened his own thread and I am over there learning with him. The order flow is what all these methods are about so, if anyone wants to learn further, please visit the "Mastering The Art of Trading" thread and read from post 1. Here is the link. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=444115 This Thread is without doubt, not for people new to trading. If you do not know the basics of S&amp;R &amp; Price action you are only going to confuse yourself as, the concepts and entries discussed in this thread are rather advanced. To say the least. Any people really new to trading should go to baby pips Babypips.com and do the free, full trading education you can get there. It is a great site and I spent a month doing the course myself years ago. Then study the J16 thread from page 1. The people in the J16 thread, are great people and will help anyone learn PA without a personal agenda. Sure, I would recommend the J16 private forum for those that need to learn at a quicker pace. But, everything is already in the J16 thread. It just takes some time to find it. Also, take special note of Jarroo's HCR-LCS posts in the J16 thread. As, if you do not know what they are &amp; how to find them, you will not understand what we are doing in this thread. This thread is not intended to give people trade setups, it is for studying the theory and practice of these methodologies. Anyone who takes trade setups that are shown in this thread, do so at their own risk &amp; responsibility. Be smart &amp; safe, open a demo account to practice any and all things you have learned in this thread or any other. I opened this thread, not to teach Jaroo's methodology of the HCR-LCS, nor the SFP but, to further my own and possibly other people's research, into Jarroo's HCR &amp; LCS methodology along with Tom's (The Wizard) Swing Failure Pattern. Basically, this means we are studying the Order Flow. Without an understanding of this, we may as well flush our money down the toilet &amp;, we don't want to do that. Forex &amp; trading is a hard business and that is why 95% of people trading, fail. Think about it, if you have a shop and sell dead parrots, like the Monty python sketch. You are going to have to be very clever to sell them. How many people will buy a dead parrot? None in reality but, basically that is what the big corporations are doing, they are making something look appealing to the masses, for their own agenda. Looks good till after they buy it or sell it. By which time it is too late. Why open a new thread you may ask? This thread sprang from the J16 thread &amp; has been opened because, I have realized how almost inseparable the HCR-LCS combined with the SFP is. I felt that posting SFP setups in the J16 thread is and, will only confuse a lot of new people who join the J16 thread to learn Price Action. This is because, new people tend to see a post about an H1 setup being posted &amp; then want to trade an hourly or even M5 chart, without having the base of knowledge of Support &amp; Resistance on the higher time frames. It is simply not possible to trade a small Time Frame, without the understanding of Support &amp; Resistance on the Monthly, Weekly &amp; Daily charts. Also as Tom's thread does not utilize the HCR &amp; LCS in the same manner that we do, I do not want to take his great thread off track, either. Link to The Wizard's Fail Better Thread which is not really about failing at all but, the Swing Failure Pattern. Link to the J16 Price Action Thread Hopefully, Jarroo will pop in from time to time and give us guidance from his watchful eye. You may well see Hourly or even lower time frame setups being taken with the above two mentioned methodologies. However, and this is important, so read it twice. Most of these setups mentioned will utilize Monthly, Weekly &amp; Daily Levels. Please keep this thread specific to PA, HCR-LCS, SFP &amp; Ghous'es Fake Out which is actually a very logical way to spot false breakouts. Also, please do not post links to threads outside FF, advertize your own thread or spam this thread. We don't want any flame wars and if anyone starts flaming, or does not observe the above, there will be no choice other than to remove the person. Let's keep this friendly, informative &amp; on track &amp; mostly indicator free.

Pairs to be discussed. The basic pattern we are looking for is, a former resistance or support area, that price breaks through and closes above or below on the Daily time frame. Here is the terminology that will be used in this thread &amp; also a few basic Price Action descriptions. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FTA = first trouble area PPZ = price pivot zone BEOB = bearish engulfing outside bar BUEOB = bullish Engulfing outside bar PB = pin bar DBLHC = double Bar low higher close DBHLC = double Bar high lower close IB = inside bar Ib4 = inside 4 bar that is the smallest bar of the previous 3 bars S/R = support/resistance PA = price action RN = round number BRN = big round number MA = moving average TL = trend line BO = breakout BO + PB = breakout + pullback RET = retracement DIV = divergence CT = counter trend SL = stop loss TP = take profit BE = break even FTB = First time back ( often used to denote the first time back to an EMA) RT= retest WIPG= Where is price going (This is an exercise designed by J16, in working out where the initial push of any given PA setup is likely to stall at, before it even breaks. In other words the FTA) WDPG= Where did price go ( This is the conclusion of WIPG) Jarroo's Methodology Terminology ------------------------------------ -------------- PBT&amp;CA= price breaks through &amp; closes above PBT&amp;CB= price breaks through &amp; closes below LCS= lowest close of support HCR=highest close of resistance SFP = Swing Failure Pattern DCC= Daily Close Confirmation Daily Close Confirmation of Support or Daily Close Confirmation of Resistance is an indication by the Daily Close to confirm that Support level has flipped to Resistance and vise vie . Note that, the short horizontal line on the PA chart, is the entry point which is usually a 10-15 pip buffer on a daily chart.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Just picked a random chart to attempt to show how the HCR &amp; LCS combined with the SFP work. Here you can see GU with the Monthly Lowest Close of support Line (Purple) &amp; The Weekly LCS Line (Red) To apply the Jarroo Level Picker on each time frame, go into navigator on MT4, scrips and drag the Jaroo Level indicator to the area where you want to place the line on the time frame you are using. It will snap to the nearest close of the candle when you drop it on the chart near the close.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Now we are on the Daily time frame and I have added two minor levels on the daily. I say minor levels because the swing points are not that deep. However, we can see the consolidation around these levels and price is currently at this area.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Right, let's watch these levels on the H4 &amp; H1 Time frames for a few hours or until the New York Open. I am editing some of these posts as this plays out in real time, to show what is going on and how we can look at these levels.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
H1 bar did not close as a PB we would take and there was no space to the FTA. We can clearly see why it bounced there. Let's watch the next H1 bar and see if it can close above the upper weekly minor level or not.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
The Game plan is not really to short this at the upper weekly minor level. We just want to see a push down to the lower Monthly level where we may see some small time frame PA such as, a Pin Bar, Bueob or a Swing Point Failure. This takes us to the next step and what a Swing Point Failure is and where to look for them.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Price is starting to get rejected, it may move quickly. But this is not the sort of setup we are looking for, we just want the push down to the lower Monthly level where, we can look for a Long opportunity. Such as an SFP, which brings us to what an SFP is.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
The swing point low of 1.51646 has been broken &amp; also the Monthly LCS has been tested. Now, we need this hourly bar to close above the 1.51646 by a few pips for an entry. Target will be the 1.5200 Round Number and the SL will be 18 pips below the entry bar's low according to the Average True Range Stop Loss. NB: From a SFP perspective, we really do not want this current bar to close as a bullish PA bar such as a PB or BUEOB, we want to get in as close to this level as possible to minimize our SL and maximize our Risk Reward Ratio.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I am in but the slippage was not good. Important note about SL. Although the SL is set at 18 pips below the bar low, if we get a hourly close below the low of the SFP bar, we get out of the trade even though our SL has yet to be taken out. The actual SL is the hourly close below the SFP bar, the ATR SL is just a precautionary SL. Just in case the Hourly bar closes 100 pips below our entry, it can happen.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
SL almost got taken out because of the widening spread from 1.8 to 2.5 pips. Let's see how the hourly closes after the smoke from NFP day clears.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Closed out the trade for a loss. Now you know why this thread is called "The HCR-LCS + SFP Research thread". Let's see what the next one does.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Pinbar, I am surprised to see that since 2nd July13 you only have posted the chart and nobody else in FF has posted anything on this thread although this thread contains most of the useful information about trading with PA, demand and supply, I am very happy to see the knowledge from J16 is being shared here, I am a big fan of J16 and learnt about the most of the bar patterns from that thread but for last many months I was searching for a holy grail and messed my charts with so many lagging indicators, tried lots of systems but ended in red, I am not blaming those systems but perhaps those systems did not suit to my personality. I am subscribed to this thread and will post my charts whenever I get time (I am in a day job so do not get time to trade much).

--- 帖子 #14 ---
.. usefull knowledge. hope to see more.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Probably because, the only person I told about the thread is Jarroo. Just wanted to get some charts up before people started posting. Now for the Postmortem There is actually another hard to see Monthly LCS but, it should not have caused this loss as, it is below our entry.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Let's see what USD/CHF can show us.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hey Pinbar, I have to say thats a very thorough and structured presentation of the core factors in your method or should I say the subject of your research?Anyway, I commend you for this layout. But if you allow me the question, what exactly is making an SFP any different from a regular bounce off from an S/R area?Why not wait for a Price action bar to confirm such an SFP?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Back to GU. It appears that it is now going to test the 1.51230 Weekly Lowest Close of support

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Missed this one on AUD/USD yesterday but, it gives you a good idea of what we are looking for.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Explanation of why an SFP works and creates liquidity. This explanation is for a Bearish SFP, the Bullish SFP is the exact opposite of this. Regarding why this differs from PA entries. Well, Tom's SFP is different than PA in as much as, if we get a PA bar the SL goes above the High or Low of the actual bar. As we know, we want a PB or BUEOB to be large and the former should have a long wick. This creates a very wide SL, that is why in the SFP we do not like to see bars with long wicks, it makes the stop too wide increasing our risk because we use the close below the SFP bar as an exit for a failed trade, as I inadvertently showed yesterday with that failed hourly GU SFP. Also as we use the ATR safety stop, putting the SL 20 pips below a large bullish PB is going to created an enormous stop thus minimizing our Reward ratio and maximizing our risk. We want to minimize the risk while maximizing the reward. If you see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
GU Once more into the breach, if we get an SFP and it touches the weekly level.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
No H1 entry so, I decided to enter on the M30 bar which did break the SFP and close above. Looks like the short term sellers were exiting their shorts and buyers came in to create the liquidity we look for. Got to go out for the evening so, I took two thirds profit and shall move to BE.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Interesting, iam familiar with J16 coz iam member and i like to see other traders interpretation of PA like this. keep it posted !

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thank you pinbar! Your charts help me a lot! Keep us posted Rock on! Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Nailed it at last. The weekly LCS level gave us this fantastic M30 entry with an SFP and a very small SL. This is what I am trying to work on in this thread. The HCR-LCS combined with an SFP or small time frame price action. The M30 tiny pb morphed into an hourly BUEOB, an H4 BUEOB &amp; a Daily BUEOB which is currently in play and broke us out of the TL. Let's see what it can do.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
USD/CHF was a bit messy on the retrace. Probably because of the weak daily close below this level. I don't like these unclear levels but, we can still watch it and learn from it. That is worth much more than taking a risky entry for a few pips profit.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
We could see a Bullish SFP on USD/CHF but, the FTA is too close for my liking. Nice confluence with the First Time Back (FTB) to the 150 EMA. However, the swing point is not very large. We really want the larger SPs. Let's just watch it and see what occurs.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for the kind comments folks. This thread is for everyone to post setups, ask questions and learn together. Your questions can help everyone including myself.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
GU is behaving so well and giving me an opportunity to explain the Rounded Retest. It is not a great example as, price has not gone as far past the swing point, that I would like to see, to take an entry here. Meaning, that it did not create enough space for price to move through. However, as I am already in this trade, it gives me an opportunity to use this area for managing the trade &amp;, will be an indication of whether or not, price is going to go North or South.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
AUD/USD was interesting

--- 帖子 #31 ---
very helpful and through info. i will be reading it regularly and ask questions if something i dont understand.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Glad to hear some people find it useful. I am learning a great deal by posting these setups and explanations. Last but not least, Welcome.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I love the thread!! I have been trading SFP, along with the rounded retests, for quiet a while after attending the_whizzard's webinars for months. I am looking for additional confirmations before taking a SFP as a SFP alone failed too many times in my trading. Looking forward to reading and exchanging ideas in here!! keep it up

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi pinbar! I got a question that bothers me for a long time now. James uses boxes to determine his PPZs and the boxes line up with the H/Ls. Jarroo uses HCR/LCS. - and goes down from TF to TF. Sometimes the weekly levels seem totally inappropriate - price just doest respect it on the lower time-frame. What shall i do? Shall I still be aware of the level, or I can wipe it off my chart? 2nd Question This is where it gets tricky. Lets assume we got a PBT + CA. - Jarroo would set a pending on the break right? (To do a bamm baby ) But what happens if this PBT couldn't break the former high - it didn't even reach it. Or what happens if we have a PBT but an SFP at the same time... So im a bit stuck here between the jarroo HCR levels and the Tom &amp; James H/L levels. Could you give me some heads up? Thanks! This thread is really great, I appreciate your efforts Steve! take care, Stephen

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Question 1: My understanding of how J16 defines PPZ is a little different. You are correct that, when we have two boxes on top of each other, there is a PPZ running through the middle of them. However, PPZ are defined by bar highs on a previous swing and bar lows from a breakout and pullback to the former resistance. Question 2: As far as I know, Jarroo does not just trade a break of these levels, he generally waits for a weekly or daily close above or below a level, then enters on the pullback to the level. This not only reduces the SL but also gets him in at a better price. Concerning the SFP, I am using the level and trying to find a decent small time frame SFP, in the same direction as the breakthrough, as I did with the GU long setup. I know what you mean about different systems seem to give conflicting signals but, if you are looking at a weekly support level, it is still going to be support on a smaller time frame. Look for the Weekly &amp; Daily closes on the H4 and H1 TF and use the Close above of below as a signature of what price may be going to do. We can not be correct 100% of the time, this used to drive me crazy as, how can we trade if we don't know for sure if a level will hold or not? The answer for me was, the winners will take care of the losers, if we use good Money Management. I suggest, you open the 8 major pairs and, put the monthly, weekly &amp; Daily levels on all the pairs, just the deep levels somewhere within 1000 pips of price in both directions. Then, just leave them on your chart for a couple of weeks. Stick to either the Daily or H4 time frames and just observe how price reacts at these levels. A common mistake it to believe they work 100% of the time, they don't and can't or, there would be no trades to have as price would never breakout of them. Price spends 90% of the time consolidating so, we want to get in after the breakout and pullback. Hope this helps.

News just took my SL out. 70 something pips locked in. There is another way to look at this, it could give us another entry long.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Pinbar, using this as an opportunity for resurch is one real good idea. of course we all need to fully understand the 3 systems. Your'e doing just fine in establishing the methods. I guess the as thread progesess we will all fell more comfortable ib chipping in. I wonder what degree various confluences play in the final outcomes. Today and tomorrow (nfp) there could be a bit of serious news to understand., Thanks for a great idea for a thread. Mike

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Glad you like the opportunity we all have. Sure, take your time and feel comfortable to post. Nobody is going to ridicule anyone in this thread for making mistakes, we all make mistakes. Yeah, there appears to be lots of news on the calendar. But, you know some people including Mike in the J16 thread pay NO attention to news. They figure it is figured into the Price Action of a bar.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hey Steve, Great job with this thread. Will be dropping in for sure. This thread allows a little more breathing space for me so I am going to enjoy here. g.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
A little bit about consolidation areas. Most people hate consolidation areas but, I remember Jarroo telling me, "One Day you will learn to love consolidation".

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Great to see you here Ghous. Yeah, that is why I thought about opening it, I was getting a little nervous posting small tf setups in the J16 thread. Hey, feel free to introduce your methodology anytime Ghous. I for one would love to see it. Hopefully Jarroo will post a bit as well, I sent him a PM telling him I had started this thread. Great how opening this thread has got me thinking even deeper about trading. Actually, Jarroo once mentioned to me that helping others, also helps ourselves greatly. It is true. Also, please feel free to correct and reprimand me when I am wrong. Let's make this everyone's thread to research Non Indicator based trading. Actually someone just asked a Great question about the J16, SFP and HCR methods, saying the different systems can be a little confusing. I think people will realize like I did recently that really, they are all the same. Only the entry is different.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hey Steve! Thank you for sharing your method! It´s seems to be great! I like james16 thread and esprecially jarroo´s method of trading. I followed his posts, but on the other thread is some noise because of the other PA methods, so sometimes i got confused. Your method is similar to jarroo´s and I will follow you! Thank you again! I took a short trade on eur/usd. daily lcs. 30 min candle closed under this lcs, so I entered the trade. SL was 10 pips about the PB on m30 (red line) and TP was at the last Swing low ( blue line). Is it right? Correct me if i´m wrong =) Cheers Andy

Trading fake outs, or SFPs whatever you call them is more a mindset and a broader approach as opposed to something as confined and restrictive as a trading system. What you need to understand is that you need your fake out bulbs to be lit if you expect something really obvious and the market isn't ready to deliver. Price trying to break above a swing point, or below a swing point, or heading to a breakout of a consolidation box or a pattern and immediately finding trouble doing so, or just the feeling of unexplained hesitance and BINGO! You're sensing pro action. This is where the best fake out trades await you. Of course to be able to pluck such setups out of ordinary ones is the true art which comes around a full circle to prove my point that trading SFPs is more a mindset and the ability to read order flow off price action, than a superficial system. g.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Wow, I am impressed, you are playing it like Jarroo does. A bit too tricky for me though, especially with the US bank holiday just started combined with the ECB news. It rocked in your direction though. Good job. I imagine you used that consolidation as the FTA? The consolidation area on the left would have been a concern for me. That said, I am sure Jarroo would have liked how you used that level. He would probably tell me, I am using levels from too far back.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Wow Ghous. This post, has blown my mind. It is almost like philosophy which I suppose it is as, market movement is really an expression of human emotion, fear, hope greed &amp; despair. So, the mechanics of the Fakey is basically like the SFP in trapping traders on the wrong side of the fence and giving the big guys a better price to buy or sell at? As J16 says, "This is a Damn hard business"!!!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Ghous I take it this weekly LCS in the consolidation area was the Level?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Nice thread PB , will try and get through this week.. jon

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Good to see you Jon. Feel free to jump in and give us your advice.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Did not make it back to the level.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Absolutely! g.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
yes. It is not a coincidence that you'll often find HCR/LCS levels lining up with good looking fake out setups. g.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Would you look for SFP on GBPUSD tomorrow? We are gettin really close to that Low... Or we dont do SFP with such "old levels" on 1H or 4H. Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #53 ---
yes, i used exactly this level thank you for your comment, steve. everyone of them ist helpfull for me. just need to practice.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Yeah, I will look for an SFP, may not trade it but, I will watch it. Being Friday, I do not want to pay the swap over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Tricky levels Sometimes when these levels are not clear, it can confuse me a little or, I tend to run away from them. I feel that it is important to understand these unclear levels, even if we choose not to trade them. Something I am working on at the moment. It is also important to note how on the H4 tf, price trickled back to the level thus, sort of creating a lack of space from the level to the FTA. This leads me to think that, momentum back to a level, is the key to creating enough space to take the trade, off the level. Previously, I would see the momentum back to a level as a sign that the level would possibly not hold, this appears to be the reverse psychology or logic.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
VERY IMPORTANT. Target areas. I have not mentioned this yet but, it is probably time to mention how Jarroo will set his targets for any trade taken from these levels. As we know, Price Breaking Through a level is related to the time frame on which this occurs and, so is the target area. If we see PBT&amp;CB on a weekly chart, we may go down to the Daily, 4H or even lower to enter the trade via a trigger such as small tf PA. Jarroo uses the Price Breaks Through &amp; Closes Below (PBT&amp;CB) bar's CLOSE &amp; LOW on the time frame it occurs on as the initial target areas for his trades. He will also take note of any bar low wicks nearby to the targets. Does this method of picking targets, ring a bell? It should as, it is actually the SFP. This is one factor that got me so interested in the SFP &amp;, showed me how inseparable the HCR-LCS &amp; the SFP actually are! So, in summary the Close &amp; Low of a PBT&amp;CB Candle, can be an area to take partial or full profit &amp;, or move to BE. As J16 says in "This is critical" "We must act at these areas by doing one of the above or a combination of the above. We may also see reversal signals and reverse our position. A weekly PBT&amp;CB bar low is a possibly an SFP on a smaller TF. See how actually HCR-LCS &amp; SFP can be both sides of the coin? It can be a lot to get our minds around, when we are new to PA. But what fun it is, learning.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hey Helius. Welcome and please give us some input on the SFP &amp; RR. My knowledge of them are limited and I have only recently come to understand the relationship with HCR-LCS. I tried to join Tom's webinars but, because of the time difference where I am currently living, combined with not being able to log into the site, has thwarted my attempts. I know that basically tom is taking the 20 period ATR on the daily tf, working out the range and then looking at both the swing in and swing out on the hourly tf, taking the shorter of the two and if it does not meet the daily range, he will pass on the trade.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
How to verify a swing point for an SFP on the hourly TF.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
People tend to think of PPZs as doors. The stronger you hit them the more the chance that you'll break the locks and barge in. Whereas a lot of timesPPZs work like trampolines. The bigger the force you hit them with, the higher you will bounce. One of the most popular myths revolving around with new traders is that bars with big strong ranges are always reminiscent of strong persistent momentum . Essentially, it all boils down to location. Such bars heading out and away from important levels hold true to what is believed about them. Such bars heading into important levels can be telling an altogether different, perhaps even the opposite story. g.

i down load the indicators and template but si not working on my chart can some one help?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks for the explanation Ghous Slowly the pieces of the puzzle are coming together. Still a long way to go on this endless journey but, it gets more exciting the longer we tread the road, like life. Eventually we will arrive at a place we can call home.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
yo wash, you should put those .mq4 files inside the "indicators folder" which can be found here. -- folder of your platform&gt;experts&gt;indicators and the template file should go here. --folder of your platform&gt;templates hope that helps sir..

--- 帖子 #63 ---
You are using Metatrader4 I imagine or they will not work. See revised post 1 for how to install the indicators.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Ah, I beg to differ, but there are 2 Templates folders, I believe your drawing points to the wrong one?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
OK, I changed it for ease of use. Thanks for pointing that out.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
One of my aha-moments when I heared Sam Seiden say "It's not how much time price spent at a level. It's the opposite - the less time price spends at a level the stronger it is." And it makes sense when you think about it. A wild move up (or down) suggests a great imbalance between buyers and sellers. Due to a rapid take-off from a level many orders will be left unfilled plus you will very likely have orders sitting underneath (in case of a bullish move) the level that will get triggered when we get back to it. Just look at the attached chart and how price reacted each time when we traded back into the area. This thinking can be applied to trading SFPs as well. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
That sounds very true. Helius, what's your take on GU for an SFP here? Would you consider this area to be too far back in time or valid? This monthly level from 2000 may show us some reaction.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Anyone else experiencing page 4 loading extremely slowly in your browser?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
No. Question: How significant the PBT move has to be? Yesterday on the EURCHF price closed above the the daily HCR. But only very very slightly. I guess that wouldn't count according to jarroo's methodology, right?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Bang! And there was light I know where I as wrong - i though about jarroo trades as long term trades. And that's where i got confused sayin "Damn - how can his be that with the jarroo method i should stay in the trade while with Tom's SFP I should go to the other direction. The picture is now complete Thank you pinbar it makes perfectly sense to quit a jarroo trade "or at least do sg. at the first FTA Wick" Lessen learned: Either go deep down into some stuff until you understand it 100% or don't care about it. Otherwise it will just messes up your head... Thank you pinbar - you made my day!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I'd want to see a much higher close above and a pullback to create space.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
You are doing fine my friend. Better than I did, it took me at least a couple of years to work that out and only after Jarroo mentioned the SFP. I could not understand why he suddenly introduced the SFP and it confused the daylights out of me, till it clicked. And, if we take a PBT&amp;CB a LCS and price closes past the SFP, what does that tell us?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I was thinking about it. Many times it works and many not. If this is true that big long candles are smart money or whatever big corporation. why when price come back it push price again up ? i dont think big corporation would hold their position to BE.. they shoud unload their position on some distribution higher. so why it sometimes works thats mystery to me

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hey Helius I have a few questions about your chart. Maybe I misunderstood your chart as, it appears that, that level is not an SFP level? Also, the new lower low on the right, shouldn't it create a new lower SFP level? And last but not least, it was mentioned in the Fail Better thread that, Tom will not trade the SFP on H4? Perhaps, you were just pointing out the momentum point you were making?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I drew the level sloppy the first time to just outline the idea but I think it is more complex and needs some further and more accurate explanation So here my next try to unload the very complex idea behind it. 1) you will often see price reverse ahead of the level. Especially when we trade back into an area for the first time (like on that blow arrow) Just keep this in mind and start paying attention to it. You will experience it a lot. Do we counteract this by seeting a limit oder a few pips shy of the level? could be, but this will go at the costs of your risk-reward-ratio. (If you just trade a blind touch without SFP confirmation) 2) With every time we come back into a level it gets weaker. Why? We will pick up more and more unfilled orders that have been left at that area. This can be clearly seen by the way we push through the level futher and further with every time we come back to the level. This way we will also pick up some stop orders below the level who are waiting for the breakout. The more often a level has been "validated" the more obvious it becomes to the "general" public and breakout traders will just have their orders beneath the level. The big bus will anticipate... NO, the big guys for sure will not let their profits run towards B/E when we come back to the level. The will long ago have closed it. BUT What moves the markets are the orders waiting at the level that have not been filled due to the sudden takeoff the time before. This is not a system or a method. But a way of looking at price and understanding whats behind the price action - like Ghous said before. How you trade it can vary in a lot of ways. Some people just trade the "blind touch" (have orders already waiting for the bounce back up), some wait for a PA confirmation (and a SFP is just one of it) .... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The actual GU chart is very similar to the UJ one from above. Again on the second touch we did not quiet make it down there. On the third and 4th touch we also spent more time at the level and not take of immediately. By the forth time people will start waiting to trade the breakout. By the 5th touch people will probably think that it will take up again but this would be a little too obvious, right Did you notice, that this is the complete opposite what they teach in all the trading books: the more touches a level has, the stronger it is. But again, 95% of all traders fail. Maybe it's time to think outside the box Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Interesting take you have on it Helius. I am going to take some time to get my head around it properly. Many thanks.

Let's see how the weekly candle closes.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Yes, will be interesting. Plus 1.5015 area might be an interesting place to look for a short trade with a rounded-retest-scenario. I will be posting my Sunday's analysis on a few interesting setups for the upcoming week if you guys don't mind.

Hi Pinbar, Nice thread, I trade the same SR Level very much as what you done. Keep it UP!! Twinsummit

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Not at all. Looking forward to it.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I like the look of EU at 1.27953 Weekly signature with the close above the WLCS and an area where we may see an SFP.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Nice level, But we are yet to see an SFP g.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Here is a trade from Friday: 7500 RN + Proven PPZ + weekly LCS Nice clean easy shot to the FTA just above 7400. g.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
EG also is on my watch list.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I like it, has an SFP also. Yeah, an SFP is the candle closing below the SP, I keep calling the level an SFP. This is the sort of thing I am concentrating on, the SFP combined with the HCR or LCS.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
We actually had a fake out already on Eur/Gbp. This was off the former recent highs and the 8600 RN. Why do you think this didn't work? Or apparently didn't drop like a stone? g.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Not enough people on the wrong side of the fence as, it did not take out the SH? Without the buyers, the big boys have nobody to sell to.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I only trade SFPs so that's my trigger always g.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Exactly! Gives price all the reason to fill in that wick. g.

You can't sell a thousand dead parrots to a handful of idiots. Like the Monty Python Sketch. Jarroo's favorite. Yeah, and they were just wetting their appetite.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I am really starting to see what you meant about, "It is more of a mindset than a system". Many thanks for keeping me on track Ghous. I can't tell you how many times over this last two years, I thought I could never understand that concept. Really, some days, I would just sit watching charts for 10 hours a day saying to myself, I just don't get it, why do I continue. Then Jarroo hit me with the SFP. I know you and others had also told me the very same things, they just did not register. The point is to keep going till they start to make sense. If it was easy, then 95% of traders would not fail and there would be nobody to sell dead parrots to.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes the infamous "illusion of randomness" g.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
The random walk. I remember you telling me a long time ago, to watch those SH bar highs or SL lows that are just hanging in space and that every bar high and low is there for a reason.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Yes that goes back to what Helius was talking about earlier with respect to Sam Seiden's teachings: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...43#post6797743 The less time price spends at a level before it bounces off it, the stronger a potential setup off that level when price comes back to it. g.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Was that a Pun Ghous? What he was walking about? I like it. Yeah, Helius has got his head screwed on the right way around. Hopefully, he can teach me &amp; others, a great deal. By the way, what is the smallest TF you will take the SFP on? I mean, I took that GU long the other day off the M30 candle but, I have not heard Tom saying anything about less than H1. Somehow, I have the feeling you are not confining yourself only to H1?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yikes! No, only a typo. lol I have traded on the 1H and the 4H time frames but I almost always find myself back on the dailies. I don't think any other time frame comes anywhere close to the reliability that the daily provides you with for SFPs specifically (just my opinion and personal experience of course). I now trade almost exclusively on the daily and occasionally the weekly. I know Tom comes from a different school of thought where he focuses mostly on the hourly, but that's where my method is a little different. Note also that I don't use the 20 period ATR for any of my trades. g.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Oh, I see. For some reason, I had it in my head, you were trading M5. Maybe that was SupremeChaos? Wonder what happened to him, he was a great guy also in the thread. So, you just use the close above or below to take you out of a trade? I shall look into this possibility also. Just watch how they work out and compare them to the hourly SFP signals.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yeah miss that guy tremendously! I am sure he is around, perhaps a little occupied with something besides FF for now. In the case of a close just below the HHR or a close just above the LLS, I take the entry on the close of the bar. Other times I like to enter via pending orders near the HHR or the LLS. Either ways I like my entries to be tucked nice and close to the business area i.e the HHR/LLS. The stop loss goes beyond the high or the low of the SFP bar itself, but with a little bit of a buffer. That is a few pips + spread beyond the SFP low/high, As an example my stop loss on the NZD/CHF trade was 60 pips (entry on the close of the fake out bar) g.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Very interesting indeed. I take it HHR= Highest High of Resistance LLS= Lowest Low of Support? I shall think about this also in the sense of the big picture. Got to get some sleep Thanks again Ghous. Yeah, I miss SC also.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
yes. HHR = Highest High of Resistance LLS = Lowest Low of Support. Simply the highest price level visited during a period of resistance and lowest price level visited during a period of support. These define the SFP levels for me. g.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
come back Supreme C...all is forgiven!! and bring back all your colours!! i think im gonna like this thread. Hey ghous, do you trade your IPBs ?? jon

USD/CAD is on my radar. The monthly box HCR looks interesting.

Rest assured the big brother doesn't want to show you down by not letting you edit posts lol You are accessing FF just fine from China, sharing your amazing charts and thoughts just fine from China. You need to contact FF with this issue. It should be resolved. g.

Hi g! My head is still a little bit dizzy due ti this fakout think. What happened there is, that price almost touched and important level That wick would have been a minor Trouble area if I were long - so to say) But apparently price didnt - it missed it. What happened then: -That wick absorbed a certain amount of sellers. - So an upmove down would be easier. -Price wanted to test that level (?) Could you give me some more light in this? Cheers, Stephen PS: I still cant express how thankful I am, for all your efforts!

Yeah, I contacted them. EDIT" Just installed Google Chrome and I can now edit again.

It is the order flow. The major corporations that may have overbought a currency are waiting to unload it at a price equal to or higher than what they bought it for. They will have their sell orders somewhere above that high, and when people thinking price has broken out place their buy orders, price will get pushed into the sell orders, trigger them, push price down and take out the buyers SL, thus reversing their position. So now, the big corporations are selling tons of that currency, the people on the wrong side of the fence, are going frantic, they accept the loss and sell at a lower price than they bought at. This creates liquidity as they are all now selling and, price can plumit. Why do you think price action works? It is not magic although, I used to really think it must be. A PB with a long wick or an Outside Bar is the exact same principle. The long wicks of a PB are people on the wrong side of the fence, it is visible in the shape of the bar but, the location of these bars is critical or, you are going to be selling into one of Ghous'es fakey bars and, paying Ghous for the pleasure. LOL However with PBs and BUEOB, we tradtionally put our stop above or below the bar, &amp; enter on the bar break. Thus increasing the risk. The SFP &amp; Jarroo's HCR-LCS, can get us into a monthly, weekly or daily PA bar, at the best price and with a tight stop close to where, if we are wrong, we don't break the bank with the SL being 150 pips from our entry. Now you know why, this thread is a mixture of PA, HCR-LCS, SFP &amp; Fakey. They are all the same thing, only the entry is different. However, we don't really have to know all this with PA, we just see the bars and check the area they come off and move into. Like, in order to drive a car, it is not neccesary to know how a four cycle gasoline engine and transmission work. Of course, it is better if you do know it but, millions of people drive without ever considering how a gasoline engine works. Like Ju Jitsu, push when your oppononet pulls you and pull when they push you. But, as Ghous is much wiser about these things, let's hear it from him.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hey Stephen, Steve pretty much summed it up very nicely and covered everything. Kindly don't go dizzy trying to desperately get a hold of this stuff. This is an advanced leg of the James16 basics which I know you are currently practicing with. This is precisely why these ideas are being talked about in a spin off thread and not in the James16 thread. If you are finding this tough to begin with its always a good idea to stick to what you're comfortable with until you're ready to begin further exploration and research. At the end of the day make sure your time in front of the charts and at FF reading and learning is fun and something you really enjoy. The advanced stuff can always wait g.

SFP areas. Sometimes when finding a good looking HCR or LCS and going down to a lower tf, I am seeing possible SFP areas that are sometimes above the HCR and sometimes below them. Just wondering which of the two is going to be the most reliable and am leaning towards the one above the HCR. Maybe Ghous has some thoughts on this. Edit: I don't mean on the same pair and area, I mean on different charts.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Here is an example of one below the HCR on CAD/CHF.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
A few things here, 1) I never mix and merge my time frames. I know contesting viewpoints say that each time frame is just a differently chopped up version of price reacting in an area but I have honestly simplified my life and eliminated headaches from my trading actions since I have started dealing with each time frame separately. A bias towards towards one time frame more than the others helps the cause. 2) the kind of order flow information you need for fake out scenarios is more adequately met by highs and lows (i.e HHR and LLS) as opposed to bar closes. Now I know how well your weekly and daily HCR/LCS levels work but my decisions are never centered around HCR/LCS levels. I use them for confluence and pin pointing my trouble areas and potential target points. That said, I am limited with respect to my understanding of HCR/LCS levels compared to some of the hard core Jarroo method followers like you for instance. I'll give it a shot though... A weekly HCR level for example is good for a long off it only when we see a weekly close above it. Now the question is what if we get fake out setups a little above and below it during the week price when price is around the weekly HCR level and which situation is more solid. My response would be that both are equally valid. As long as we don't get a weekly close above the weekly HCR all bearish action around that region is still a short signal for me. The reason once again lies in the principle of bar closes. Until you get a weekly close above, price is still under resistance from the weekly HCR. Now this is just my understanding, and I know there exists space for a system, in Jarroo's method where people tend to take longs of higher time frame HCR levels when a 1H or the 4H closes above them, though he too admits that that's fairly risky. Hope this helps a bit. g.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Tricky question and I am sure you can find traders arguing for both the uper and lower level. What might speak for the lower? It's the "origin" of the move. Hence, we had the greatest imbalance - sellers &gt; buyers - at this point which made it fall. What might speak for the upper? 1) We could have left unfilled orders sitting here that did not get executed. 2) It's a likely place for a stop buy order from people trading a breakout strategy and big player could aim for taking the guys out. I have asked myself this very question so often before but I believe there is no one answer. Experience and playing the probabilities is what kicks in here...

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Bammm and There Was Light Again! I gotta admit I had to read certain parts twice til i got it 100%... And then I was like Baaaam. Wooooow. And really It makes sense... At all these setups only the timeframe differs. I mean at pinbar the whole breakout- and order-overloading happens in one day, til in the cases of Engulfing bars and Inside bars they happen in 2 days. And also: We like the Engoulfing bars better, since the "Pushing" momentum of the "big hands" were greater then in the case of the Inside Bars. So we got nothing else to do, just to enter and have a nice journey with the big guys (Okay I know its not that simple ) Ghous! Thank you for your worries. No yet im not going to start testing SFPs too. That would be too much work. The SFP concept is relatively easy I think (for me it seems easier than the j16 trades) but for now im just gonna follow the thread, and after Im ok with the j16 basics I can continue from a higher level here. And yes - Im an engineer student - I love to know how things work. And thats why I find order flow so fascinating Have a nice Sunday Night. Market opens soon! Get ready!

I just wanted to share how I do my Sunday's homework. Basically I just flip through my charts and see if the charts offer some interesting levels price might run into in the upcoming week. This way you are prepared and have a gameplan. Each morning and evening I check again and see if I see any potential trades develope and put in orders if necessary. Here are some of the pairs I am watching that I find have some interesting levels coming close.

thats a curse right there, im the same. the fact is we dont need to know, i dont care what anyone says. the simpler i keep it the better (for me), knowlage is all well and good but iv learned to spend my time on more productive things when it comes to trading, like back-testing etc. jus my opinion jon

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks Helius for, both for the explanation of the question I asked about the Upper and Lower possible SFP areas above a HCR or LCS. I am also of the opinion that there is no specific answer and only trial and error will let me decide which if any is going to be more reliable. On the pairs you are interested in, I always find it interesting that people studying the same methodology tend to find the same setups and, I believe this is confirmation that, people are on the right track, At least I am on the same page as most of your possible SFP setups. The NZD/USD, I saw but am leaving the RR for the time being. Many thanks again for your valuable input.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Many things to ponder here, which is great. I need some time to really think about these. Concerning the HCR or LCS time frame which the PBT&amp;CA or below, I have some thoughts about the dimension of time in the penetration of a HCR or LCS level. Well, it is not really time but the actual depth of the penetration. However, as we all know, the greater the penetration of an area, the more space this creates for price to move through after the pullback and RT. I am also pondering if it is not just about space but time? Time in the sense that, the more time there is before the pullback, will allow more people to actually see the setup and possibly convince them that, the sell orders above are insufficient to force price below a former resistance area which may now act as support. I could be way off here but, this is how I am thinking about the depth of penetration.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Not sure what you mean about "PBs breaking out in one day and Outside bars and IBs breaking out in two days. I see all Daily PA either breaking on the next bar or in two days. In the case of the daily PA bar not breaking on the next daily bar, people like Mike will not take the trade as it is a sign of lack of momentum and order flow. Can't see that an Outside bar has more momentum than a PB, it can't really when you think about it as, they are both simply extensions of order flow. I lean more these days towards not the bars themselves but, the area they came off being more important. Probably due to the influence of the SFP. Just trying to keep it as simple as possible. Hope you can grasp what I mean. My experience since I started here at FF some years ago is, one day, I think I work something out only to discard it a few days later. Possibly, this is how we learn and is necessary in the process of understanding the big picture. Not that I understand it all yet, nowhere near, I am just getting my feet wet.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hey, LT I am not nitpicking here, just want to make sure you are aware of the correct form of a BUEOB as opposed to a DBLHC. The BUEOB you drew on your diagram is actually not a BUEOB, it is a DBLHC as, the low of the bar does not exceed the low of the previous bar. A BUEOB's High &amp; Low must both exceed the High &amp; Low of the Previous bar.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
CAD/CHF is showing signs that it may find support at the lower area.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Interesting thought. I think both, the time spent and the space occupied beyond the HCR or the HHR do to an extent affect the ability of the HCR / HHR flipping from resistance to support and providing us with a bias as to whether this is a breakout or a fake out. That said, I don't think these factors are entirely conclusive in providing a definite bias. What matters more than any other factor is I think the action itself that is comprised of that space and time. The wicks on bars, the overall range, the bodies... Let me explain with some examples.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Here is an example of quite some time spent underneath the critical LLS and LCS areas yet still price fails to break to the downside and turns out to be a fake out. You can see right from the break out point we have implicit divergence kicking in. (For those unaware of what this is, its a term I use to spot lack of momentum or divergence smack from the chart only. It is characterized, as in this case, by bars not being able to close under former bar lows (for momentum exhaustion during a down trend) or above former bar highs (for momentum exhaustion during an uptrend)). The bar that breaks out and actually closes below the LLS or simply the swing low, is a pretty weak bearish bar signified by the longer wick and a weak close. Its closer an IPB actually. Two subsequent days we see the market going really flat, and despite testing the LLS on each day it failed to gather enough sell orders. The result then is a surge back up and a quick retest to confirm the support function of the LLS. In order flow terms the retest implies that all liquidity juice available at the LLS level has now been sucked up by the big guns and price can now move easily to the upside. I had mentioned in a previous post that reading order flow, fake outs and what the big guys are up to, is simply wondering on the simple question: "Is price doing what it should be doing?" In this case, after a break under the LLS, Price should be headed down. What then, do 2 back to back really small nothing bars tell us? Yes price has spent nearly 3 days under the swing low. But is that necessarily indicative of the fact that the LLS has really turned into resistance? g.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Very interesting Ghous However, if we look at the weekly tf and that consolidation box HCR, ignore the fake out as it was obviously a fake out. We can see that the area you mentioned on the daily tf, never managed to break the HCR which by hindsight, we can see had been holding this up all along. That said, I think such a weekly area, even though it is way back, is always going to trump a daily level. So all in all, we did not have a breakout and thus spent zero time below this level.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Let's take a look if more space occupied above a former swing point should be necessarily more bullish... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached is the EUR/MXN chart with a badass pin bar that worked like a charm. Notice how its also a fake out. Notice also, that over a period of three days price actually tests as much as 200 pips of solid space above the HHR. I reckon many 1H and 4H bar closes above the HHR and HCR. The way I see it it only means the pin bar comes with a much longer nose/wick and hence is really more strong than if it had a smaller nose in case of less space occupied above the HHR region. Let's jump down a time frame to see what price action looked like in a more chopped up, more revealing setting: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Once again it has boiled down to particular action and the bar to bar analysis which truly reveals what price is really looking to do. The banks are smart. They will some times target the exact levels, some times place their above them, and other times way above them. At times even under them... They need to make this all look like too unpredictable and maybe even "random". The dimensions of time and chart space are often the variables they like to play around with to create the variability needed to safeguard their guile. Our bigger stories, confluence, space, and the understanding of support and resistance can get us really deep into the territory of these bigger players and market makers and thats why I am always worried when I see new people trying to attempt trading order flow through fake outs or even thinking about them too much. Its not until you can look at your chart in aggregation and combine the different elements at play according to their relative importance to construct the bigger story, that you can consistently nail this. just because I am writing doesn't mean I have mastered it either. I too am practicing. I make mistakes too and miss out on what later can turn out to be darn obvious. But every day that passes by it adds to the knowledge and experience and that's all that matters...err...aside from making sure you're enjoying every second if it too. g.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
The highest close of resistance for that period / box of consolidation for me would still be the close on the first of the two bars that you excluded as being a fake out. A true fake out would have only left a wick behind. However after that close above the lower level you drew, I don't see how it should be excluded and not treated as the true HCR for that "period" of resistance. Again dude, I am not into HCR and LCSs... g.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I hear you on the Fake out but, Jarro has taught me that the consolidation areas can have a fake out like that. Here is an explanation of what he taught me or at least, the way I remember it. Totally hear you on that, I am not into the tricky areas of HCR LCS like that one. Come to think of it, I am sure I have also seen Mike, use a flag like that one and disregard the fake out, also.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
This is one of Jarroo's charts and you can see, while he is marking the fake out to take notice of it, he is actually not using it as the level. He explained to me that, this is because it found very little support on the pullback after it closed above the consolidation area. This actually has a little bounce, much more than the EG one.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Here is another one of Jim's charts where he is explaining it to me. Notice how he is not using that HCR in the fake out again?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Yes I hear you, Obviously I can't challenge Jarroo or his approach specially when I don't know too much about it. Anyhow, the examples I gave were based on the HHR/LLS levels which I use as opposed to the HCR/LCS levels for determining my fake out setups so I guess they are relevant in that sense. Maybe not so much with the HCR/LCS context... g.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I totally agree Ghous &amp; I need to understand your take on it as much as Jarroo's take on it. Will put my thinking cap on and ponder it. I am sure that if Jarroo comes around he will explain it or tell me I am wrong, either is fine for me as long as we get to the real deal. It is probably because he considers the established consolidation to be stronger than a spike with no polarity flip of the level being confirmed. Better explain a bit in a simple diagram of what I was talking about for the new people.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
So we are taking a loss on the long on the first PBT&amp;CA instance when price doesn't hold at the HCR? Just trying to get my head around this... g.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Steve! That was not actually what i meant. I just noted that while in the case of PinBars (PB - sorry for my abbreviation) the process of newbs going for the break and the "big hands" pushing them down happens in one day. While in the case of InsideBars or Outsidebars (Or DHLC etc) this process happens in two days. And this is what i wanted to interpret on my picture - that the Engouldfing bars and insideBars are pinbBars if we look at a "2Day Chart" - and so then the whole order flow concept is the same... have a nice day guys! Stephen

--- 帖子 #135 ---
This is my favourite thread! For me the thread title is rather "Two pros teaching dummy Stephen now " Ghous! - The was you described those two charts with order flow - i was like: I got a question though: "In order flow terms the retest implies that all liquidity juice available at the LLS level has now been sucked up by the big guns and price can now move easily to the upside." Do you mean that all the guys who wanted to go short on the break did it already? I can imagine to scenarios: Price breaks up (like it did) - cause just as you say, the liquidity is gone. (But we were not sure if how many sells are at the close... (Hmmm however after sich a weak breakthrough and such a long struggling at the Lows, i dont think many did...) Now could it be possible that price breaks short? I mean when we got such a "battle" between sellers the buyers got weak at the end too, didn't they? Maybe im just looking for some missing puzzle pieces here. Or how would you have explained if price brok down. (Or if you think my question is stupid cause after such a weak break with implicit divergence we don't have much power to go south, its okay too Could you give me some light here? Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hey Stephen , It would have made more sense if price had broken down earlier when it first broke through the LLS and pulled back to test the LLS as resistance. It did not hold and price shot back up. Every bit of this explains that the bulls were in control all the time. The second retest, this time from the upside, to test the LLS as support again simply was a means to consume any remaining sell orders and their stop losses as well as get on board more buyers who would be willing to get a share of the move at a discounted price (rather than having to buy later on when the initial leg of the trend is already established). Basically just wiping out the bearish activity hence consuming on every milliliter of the juice available to execute large position sizes hope this clears up. g

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Sorry, had guests and was away from the PC. It depends, Jaroo would look for a signature on a smaller TF on the way back to that level. Edit: I know Jim, will look for an H4 or H1 signature on the pullback to a level. Myself, I will look for an M30 or even M15 signature if there is no H4 or H1 signature. Looking at that chart I posted with the what I caled a fake out, we can see that on the pullback to the level, there was no H4 or even H1 signature saying that this area had flipped to support. It just rocked through the area so, I doubt we would take a loss on it. If you see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Still can not follow what you mean. The market decides if and when a PA bar will break, not the form of the PA. Also, a true PB at a good location does not get pushed down by the big boys, they designed it. It is there hand in Poker. Maybe, what we are talking about is confusing you and you may just want to stick with regular PA off PPZ levels for a while. The PA that is taught in the J16 thread is not a fake out, they are the order flow just the same as what we are talking about in this thread only from a different perspective. We are trying to enter before the larger TF PA is formed, to get in at a better price. Look at the GU entry I made last week. I got in on the M30 pb off the weekly LCS. This morpded into an hourly, H4 &amp; Daily BUEOB but, I was in with a small stop and before the Daily BUEOB ever formed. Also note, the Daily BUEOB did not take two days to break.

Hi Steve! Never mind. I know that price decides if our PA was valid by breaking it. Ghous described the order flow of the pinbar - so then it was clear for me what happes "behind the walls". And then i just realized that at a BUOB or an IB the same thing happens but slower. And thats why i brought the pictures: So we can see that if we merge a BUOB into a "2day chart" what do we get - a nice pinbar. And what do we know about the order flow of pinbars... Well that what ghous just told us... So eventually (for me) its proven that the order flow of the BUOBS is the same as for pins, just it takes more time... That was my point. take care, Stephen

I don't see any fake out g.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Yes I see. Good stuff. g.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Price attacking a level aggressively doesn't necessarily mean it is going to break through. In fact mostly it means quite the opposite. g.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
SFPs at important support/resistance such as LCS and HCR seem quite reliable. I've been studying and looking at many charts. Even when price approaches weekly LCS/HCR SFPs may occur on H1, H4 and daily.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Weekly with LCS Attached Image (click to enlarge) H1 chart with what I believe is a SFP/BUOEB. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #146 ---
After reviewing the thread I can see my view on SFP was wrong so disregard my previous posts.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Maybe, I am confusing what SupremeChaos was doing. Here we have an M15 PB that closed right on the weekly gap, it broke by 1.4 pips then its back broke. Obviously I am confusing your fake out method with the IBP or something along those lines.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Still waiting for a lot of these pairs I setup to trigger. Which is ok and some of them may not trigger for a while.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
You can always delete the post if you want to but, I think you were in the same ball park. Take a look at the monthly chart and the H1 chart. Just not much space to the FTA because of those weekly LCS levels nearby.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Yes, we are certainly not on the same page. The way I see what you're doing here is you are pointing out your LCS and HCR levels and on a lower time frame considering bars that make a move beyond these levels only to close back within them as fake out or SFP trades. If this is so, then its entirely different to how I trade and look for fake outs. As previously mentioned, I am looking at extreme highs and lows of swing points only and considering fake outs off them if bars venture beyond them and get a sharp rejection. I also don't switch time frames. That's really it. When I started off, HCR/LCS levels were a critical and crucial component of every setup. Over time I just simplified things and learned that the trades were doing well without the additional filters. So there you have it. g.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Not really, I was looking at the Bearish M15 PB that closed above the level and thinking it was going to be a failed PB, which it was as its back broke and we got a push up. So, if I get this right, you are trading off the daily tf, using the HHR &amp; LLS in a fashion similar to an sfp and, entering on the failure of the Daily candle to close above or below the HHR or LLS? Would your target for a Bearish setup be the previous bar close? Thanks Ghous

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Not really, I was looking at the Bearish M15 PB that closed above the level and thinking it was going to be a failed PB, which it was as its back broke and we got a push up. I think, I confused matters with that PB by calling it a "Fake Out" what I really meant was, the pb was going to fail. So, if I get this right, you are trading off the daily tf, using the HHR &amp; LLS in a fashion similar to an sfp and, entering on the failure of the Daily candle to close above or below the HHR or LLS? Would your target for a Bearish setup be the previous bar close? Thanks Ghous

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Would this be a setup with the way you trade? I know the FTA is too close, just an example.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
There was this question "How long is a level valid?" Here two great current examples! That GBP/USD bounced 100% as expected. You can play these "blind touches" with such a ridiculous tight stop that your risk-reward-ratio will always work out over time!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Indeed, Market memory is a funny thing Yeah, I have been watching GU and waiting for it to actually break the 1.48303 level by a pip. No go yet but, I feel it will.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hey Steve, Yes that's pretty much it. And the FTA is normally how you see Mike spot them, previous bar close may be the case depending on the situation, but its not something I am looking at every time. g.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
yes. That came across my radar yesterday. The FTA was too close to pull the trigger, but generally that's the kind of stuff I am on the look out for. g.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I am in Gu. Damn slippage cost me 6 pips though. Anyone else realized MT4 now allows us to click the SL line and drag to the desired level? This level on GU also appears to be a weekly PPZ.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Great stuff Helius! Those PPZs are money in the bank at so many levels You're either nervously shotgunning trades and hoping for them to work out, or you are sorted enough to wait for these golden locations on your chart. g.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Ok, now I really know what you are doing. Will look into the possibilities. Actually, perhaps this GU entry will show me the Daily Close above and the entry you may take.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Nice potential level on USD/CAD coming up with a WHCR &amp; a swing point that price has previously, seriously been rejected at.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I am watching the USDCAD level as well. But I am a little cautios because we have been more than 9 time back at this area. What speaks for it is the clear sell off after ther last touch....

--- 帖子 #163 ---
The channel looks like it could be a problem. It did not rally fast enough and create space. Divergence is there though.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
So far I am not too impressed with the way price has "stuck"at that LLS. Still some time to go for the daily to close so its still very unofficial at this stage. g.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Here's one that's on my watch list BIG TIME! g.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hey Steve! Could you tell me where did you put your TP? Thanks, Stephen

--- 帖子 #167 ---
When trading these extreme points it is usually quiet hard to find a decent place for a stop because, like in the case of the GU, price hasn't been lower for quiet a while. I prefer to look at the ATR and see if price has "completed" its daily ATR. If so I am willing to use a tighter stop. On that GU trade I had a 30 pip SL. By now I have taking it to break-even and closed a tiny part of the trade. Not to wake up with empty pockets Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #168 ---
still learning a bit but can you tell me why you took a buy there? Also why your target is where it is. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Seems that it does not have the Bham effect we thought it may have. I intended to close out two thirds of the trade but, it seems FXPRO will not allow it anymore, and for some reason it closed the whole trade. Just as well really as, it does not seem to want to breakout.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I like your USD/CHF much better than the USD/CAD because of the momentum back to the level, creating more space. Rather than, the stairway to heaven on UC where a short could very easily find support at the upper Chanel.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Well, the Weekly LCS was going to be where I would have taken partial profit and or moved to BE. Depending on the reaction. As it turned out, there was no momentum so, best to take profit while we can.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Just discovered that my understanding of the Rounded Retest is not exactly as it should be. Maybe Helius can confirm this. It appears that for a RR to be valid there must be three prior swing points, that price breaks through and rounds off as it returns to the area.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Just thinking about what Ghous was saying about the way he is trading these days. It does seem to really jump out at you when you start thinking about these areas. Bet he was all over these former areas on GU.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
In on Gu again. I finally feel good about the daily close. (Back within the former bar's range ) g.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I'd overlooked this detail as well. Upon reviewing many of the charts Tom pasted in the fail better thread, indeed most of the rounded retests had 3 touches before the break and retest...and the retest should have some space after the breakthrough.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Yeah Tyler, we live and learn. That is the fun of life.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Me too but because of the H1 small BUEOB.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Got my eye on this Monthly &amp; Weekly level on EU.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes, that GU did not take off as expected but we def saw some nice reaction and it keeps going Regarding the RR there is no set rule of how many touches you need. you just want to have a strong level that has acted both as support &amp; resistance before in the past. This ensures that you have strong level. Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I also took this H1 BUEOB on my live account but, did not like the sluggishness around the wlcs so, I took 42 pips and banked it. Probably because of still being in the Asian session. It may fly to the moon and that is ok as, there will always be another entry.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thanks for your input on the R&amp;R criteria. Quidsey, in Tom's thread seems to know what he is doing and mentioned the following in a post to somebody's question. Hey, not that I am saying that, you don't know what you are doing, I just want to get it right.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
appreciate your input. I am trading the RR the way Tom taught and trades them himself. I have never heared of the 3 touches rule. But I guess you can add a variety of ways how to filter trades. It's not a fixed system and many people will argue about whether some areas are levels or not. You just gotta get your own experience and backtesting results to feel comfortable trading them. As it applies to any setup actually.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yeah, I figure that is what I need to know. Maybe, Tom changed the way he is doing things because, I found a post in which he traded a failed Barclays Bank Rounded Retest that he said was a weekly setup. He mentions that he took the trade on the daily tf. Note the three Sls?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I even see 4 But again, that's just one setup. I have taken hundreds and hundreds using forextester. You gotta get your own stats based on what you see and how you interpret and tade it.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I think you may be missing my point. I am not concerned if it works or not, by doing it one way as opposed to another, I can always fiddle with it myself. The thing that concerns me is, Quidsey, in Tom's thread is saying this is not how they are played. Just do not want to give people the wrong information.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I have attended Tom's webinars for months regularly and never heared of the 3 touches rule

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I hear you and I also know Tom sometimes does things differently than he says, he even admits it himself. Just looking through the Fail Better PDF and found this. He seems to be making a strong point about the three swing points in the chart by numbering them. I will ask Quidsey if he can point me to anywhere, that Tom explains this. It is hard, I know as the information in that thread, is thrown around all over the place with no real basics laid out before the noise kicks in.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
How did you put the stop loss on GBP USD? I thought we use ATR(20) for the stop loss so it should have been lower ? ATR(20) is 133 on my broker. From what I understand the stop loss should be at 133 pips lower than the low of SFP and if price closes lower than the low of the previous swing low we close the trade.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Wouldn't be surprised to see a Ghous Fake out of this pendant, going straight into the double WHCR. Just to hit peoples' SL just inside the pendant and thus reversing their positions for a push up to the where they really want to sell it. Terrible when you think about it.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hey str8, I am not sure how this would sound to you, but I don't use the ATR and its not part of my method. g.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi ghous Can you tell me how do you put your stop loss? You look at the low and put it a little lower? The stop loss using ATR is quite big and I would like to use your method of putting stop loss.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Wow! Great break down on that Steve, This one's like an action thriller you want to enjoy on a comfy leather couch with a bag of pop corn. g.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hey Str8, Yes I place my stop losses arbitrarily a few pips beyond the fake out high/low. Its advantageous because it can get you a better R:R than using the ATR method but then has the demerits of being aggressive and too discretionary. Just so you know that there are pros and cons to every method that you choose to adopt. g.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yeah, on the couch but not in the breakout, short. I think these are the places, where we should look for them, possibly? GU is having a hard time getting above that WLCS, eh?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Things got interesting because of the 1.05 RN there, but ideally I get nervous around so many major swing points. Some clarity and conspicuous action is always a treat. g.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I hear you Ghous It is like a Crime scene just waiting to happen. Think it has a little more room to move up so, probably just waiting for more victims.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
The Scary thing is, a couple of weeks ago, I would probably have been one of the victims shouting, "Go baby Go', as a small bar broke through the lower TL. Not now though, thanks to Ghous &amp; Jaroo.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi guys, just to clarify this point I've had a root around in my old files and found something that might help. This is from Tom's paid webinars so I'm not going to post the whole thing, I don't want to piss him off , but these are his words not mine. They come from a flow chart of decision making concerning the Rounded Retest set-up. Any entry orders placed are always: Sell above market, Buy below market. 1- was the level the inverse last? if selling was it SUPPORT last? if buying was it RESISTANCE last? 2- if YES then has it had at least 3 prior touches before? Each touch should ideally have caused a significant reaction with price "swinging" away. 3- if YES then is there space from the time the market broke out to the test you are about to trade? 4- if YES then place a limit order at the level. (my words)... now there are ways to trade 2 touch levels which involve finding confluence with either a Daily bias, Daily fib level or ATR which I'm not going to go into here but the best set-ups are with 3 touches or more. Hope this helps, all the best.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
You simply mean that during the breakout lot of guys went long and now the big guys are pushing the price down, thus taking out the SLs of the Breakout-Traders? And when its done then they will simply push the start button, and price will go up like a rocket? In your former post "Just to hit peoples' SL just inside the pendant and thus reversing their positions for a push up to the where they really want to sell it." Or am I missing / misunderstanding something? Cause as I understand your above quoted sentence the big guys push down the price - so that SLs are hit, after this is done price will move a bit higher where the big guys want to sell again? ("sell at a better price") I just want to understand the things , thats all Thanks Steve. Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Many thanks Quidsey. That clarifies things greatly. I think it is easy to mistake the R&amp;R as I did and, think of it as an SFP after price breaks through and comes back on the other side. Obviously, there is more to the Rounded Retest than that and your post, helps greatly. Many thanks again and please drop in anytime and give us your opinion. Steve

--- 帖子 #201 ---
No, it has not occurred yet, we are simply speculating that, it is a possibility in an attempt to push price higher for the big one. We are talking about the channel on the Daily TF. Just watch that chart and see what happens. Then, tell us what you see happening.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hey Ghous You got the Popcorn ready? LOL

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Something very interesting that I came across recently. Why is the general public usually wrong? Just look at the NU 4H excerpt. We have clear defined border to the downside. But we have numerous wicks testing the lows. What does these spike below the range mean? It's very likely that the big players are loading up on longs there. Who are they buying from? Yep They have to accumulate positions slowly in order to keep the market from taking off. So they will let price get down as wide as they can and below that range many breakout traders will have short orders. Institutions take the opposite and price moves up. But not too much.... This might be an indication for further moves higher. And it's just a way of looking at PA I found worth sharing Attached Image

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Yeah, without understanding the order flow we may as well flush our money down the toilet.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
You can place a check against that lol g.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Great stuff Helius, Consolidation boxes at swing points can be extremely telling to people willing to lend an ear to the market vibrations g.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
My you have put some weight on. That's what popcorn does for you. I know its not you.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Redid the front page. Took the indicators off. People don't need them and will only ask questions about how to use them. Variety is the spice of life. Every time I see a post of Lamertrader, I confuse the chart with my own. Drives me nuts.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hey, Ghous &amp; Helius If you are still in the GU trade, you are almost at TP. Good job. You guys are braver than me. When I saw it dithering, that was it.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hey Steve, Your idea was right as it did start off slow. We traded the same setup but on different time frames. The daily calls for a bit more patience and the lower time frames allow you to be flexible and react to the current action. Once again neither approaches are wrong nor is it about being brave or timid. Its just about our individual comfort zones. g.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks for the kind comments Ghous. If it doesn't Bham, I always think the level is suspect. I shall work on this.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
It does Bam a lot, but very often price does take off a little slow, and isn't necessarily a sign of weakness (just like Helius was talking) g.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Mmm, I could easily confuse the sluggishness around a level with weakness and not see the bigger picture there. More stuff to think about.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I realize it is a slow jacking up so they can buy more without putting the price up. But how can we differentiate between this and genuine weakness where, price hangs around a level before breaking through.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
That is one reason I let go off the lower TFs. Just the mindset of being patient and letting the trade play out which is imperative for trading the higher TFs helped me eradicate unnecessary nerves, stress and haunting thoughts that I felt uncomfortable with due to the flexible, discretionary nature of lower time frame trading. But I agree that setups like these can be tricky to manage, and even on the dailies you can get price dying out after printing solid setups before heading in the right direction and these can easily be the toughest setups to manage. Normally you do have factors to formulate some kind of a logical expectation though. I'll get back with examples... g.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks Ghous, appreciate it. Take your time as, I have to crash out. Got to take my wife to the airport early tomorrow morning. Thanks again and look forward greatly to a new way of looking at things.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
The answer once again lies in the actual bar to bar action and factors at play in the individual situation as opposed to a more generalized solution that you can apply on every situation. Once again this is getting into the most advanced and the most toughest aspects of trading order flow and fake outs. One that so far troubles me often as well when i come across it in real time. Audience discretion advised... g.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Just my take on how I'd look for an entry on the LTF with a D1 bias. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #219 ---
HEY Quidsey, I was looking at the retest nefore and was thinking about adding to my position. Very nice rounded retest! And yes Pinbar, almost there Took off slowly at the level but eventually it did as expected.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
One of my major research projects these days revolves around the idea of potentially considering setups that initially don't appeal but due to the unfolding action gain strength. So we know when we see a Nice big bearish pin bar and if it doesn't break soon it weakens the setup and some people actually even pull off their orders if the pin bar doesn't break on the next bar. We know this from our James16 methods. Can subsequent action after a mediocre setup actually provide it some strength? Price slowly "but surely" ticking in favor of the setup, I have come to believe, has the power to strengthen an initially weak setup. (Again still part of my research and not something I can say with absolute confidence) Two interesting cases occurred on the USD/CHF. You can find such examples on any TF but since I stick around the dailies mostly I'll be using that time frame with my examples. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Both these setups are fake out setups running into close by trouble areas. You would shout a big "NO" if you see them initially. However notice how despite visiting resistance multiple times on both occasions price seems to still hold up at the LLS. At this point recall Mike's wick plays and some of the failed Pin bars that you can think of. What essentially happens with a failed pin bar is that price fills in the wick proving that the order flow that created the wick was not strong enough and essentially only managed to create a "vacuum" for price to move through (price always chooses the path of least resistance). Now if the wicks on these two fake out setups represented weak buying and if the order flow at the FTAs (marked in blue) were truly strong enough then price should have had no trouble trickling down into and filling in the wicks (and perhaps more). Instead we see that no daily bar actually closed under the LLS (the decision point of course) and eventually price broke higher. These are 2 instances where the fake out setups are weak to start off with but as price holds around and despite close by FTAs and some resistance at them you get a feeling price is waiting for tip off. The first setup (to the left of the chart) shows a bar attacking the FTA and eventually closing under leaving behind a small wick on the upper side. The next bar which began the surge to the upside starts off by "filling in" that wick and never looking back. If this was truly a false setup price would have been filling in the wick of the fake out bar. On the second setup too notice the bar that breaks out and closes above the FTA and how we get a nice pullback to the FTA to confirm support at it before price continues on. These are examples of situations where, the fake out bars them selves don't create any trade triggers but merely contribute to the overall story and the true trigger bars are created in the action that follows the initial fake outs. g.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Coming to your question Steve, as hinted above in my post there are normally parameters and factors that you can look into to make out what price is trying to do and whether that can potentially be detrimental to your trades. These factors include FTAs, Round numbers, LLS/HHR, EMAs and other things you watch like your HCR/LCS levels. By simply looking at where price is looking for support and resistance you can, for the most part, make sense as to what that "slow movement" is signalling. Its like decoding the thing backward. You start off with looking at your bar to bar action and then putting this piece of the puzzle into the entire bigger picture to see if it makes sense. In the above examples, bullish fake out setups that are moving slow to begin with are explained by close by first trouble areas on both setups and look bullish because you don't see any threatening bearish action (such as a close below the LLS) to realize your fears. Once again its about not being emotional and not getting bogged down if your expectation of a setup to be a BAM setup isn't fulfilled. Its really about just looking at things objectively and making sure any actions that you take are well justified on grounds of simple technical analysis and the ideas of support and resistance. hope this helps. g.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Yes would have been an ideal place, (FOMC as I type), I was going to say I'd be looking for 4920 to hold

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Ghous your pin LLS closing theory is Mind-blowing However was the LLS in your case the left eye of the Pin? Pinbar - Was this what you meant? Price breaks out of the Daily Trendline - People are happy cause the even see a bit of a Pullback Retest (which tests the minor PPZ at the same time ) - and now they are expecting price to fall? So people are selling while the big-ones are buying? Or was it simply due to some news... (Its possible as well cause EURUSD had a huge move as well at this time...) Cheers Stephen

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi guys! Could any of you give me a hint on this from an SFP + Order flow view? I already learned that wicks create vacuum that price can fill easily... What was wrong here? (I didnt trade it - just askin, cause i noticed while scrolling charts

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Great stuff Ghous and many thanks for your time in explaining this in such detail. It is 5:30 am and my mind is still not awake so, I shall ponder this and get back to you with any questions, on my return this afternoon.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Well, for a start, the Basics of SFP setup is that, the SFP bar must close above the swing low, not just on it. If we look at the bar you chose, we can see that the SL should have been 35 pips + spread below the bar. It did not fail if you had applied that ATR SL, even though it was not the real setup bar. Also, note how the low of that candle is actually 1.28563 It is actually the SFP candle as, it took out the low but then closed exactly on the SP low, not above it. Maybe Helius or Quidsey can give you a better explanation.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Wow, You guys really nailed GU.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
No it was for the lowest low of the former swing point. I.e the yellow lines on my chart. g.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
To begin with, the pin bar was headed straight into a big box of consolidation and immediate trouble area in that prior swing low hovering just above the pin bar. Always remember that price will take the path of least resistance. Here it was caught up between the order flow that triggered the pin bar and the bearish order flow being sourced from that consolidation box/FTA/PPZ. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at the bar that tried to penetrate the consolidation box and only ended up closing back under the it (the one I have a down arrow on). If this was some real bull muscle striking the next bar should have easily filled in this week and went on higher. Instead we see solid rejection off the level and price proves that the bullish order flow was weak in this case and price actually fell through the lower wick of the fake out bar / pin bar. So how do you know before the fact, whether this was more likely to shot up or down? This is where our good old James16 knowledge of support and resistance comes in handy. The consolidation box that price is headed into occupies much more space as well as time compared to the order flow contained in the bullish pin bar. By all means that pin bar has a good decent nose but its still headed into what Mike refers to as "traffic". That should immediately put us off from thinking long i.e having a neutral or a bearish bias to this setup as opposed to pulling the trigger on it as a bullish setup confidently. ***----------------*** Order flow perspective of the pin bar and what happened after What interests me more than anything else though, is though that the setup has still worked! Confused? A fake out setup doesn't fail until we get a bar close underneath the low of the fake out setup. This poses an interesting problem for trade management purposes. Deciding exits on bar closes rather than price levels means keeping the stop loss open till we actually see the bar close. In this case that would have saved you, but you can imagine the risk associated with having to watch price drop all the way to the low of your fake out setup and then violate it and keep going only to eventually pull back. Specially on lower time frames this can be detrimental as you're playing with fewer pips and anything, a news spike for instance, could create havoc and pull you down into an irrecoverable loss. Tom solves this problem using the ATR approach. I go for an arbitrary stop placement beyond the fake out setup high/low which tends to work great with higher time frame setups specially. Excuse the rambling, but the point that I am drawing your attention to, is that if you carefully notice you actually have a fake out off the low of the initial fake out setup. Refer to the post I made earlier about setups initially appearing as weak and eventually gaining strength. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price completely fills in the wick of the fake out setup but could it be that the pros actually just pumped in more positions at the discounted price levels? That is precisely where the concept of implicit divergence comes from. The ability of bars to not close beyond prior important bar lows/highs is what implicit divergence is all about. Its unlikely that the pros will unload their entire positions within tight price ranges because the tighter the price range the more limited is the liquidity available in the region. Given the big consolidation box above, its unlikely the pros would risk dropping the load off so close to a region that could attract sell side order flow. Would it make more sense for them to allow some sellers to jump in and simply buy off even lower price? What if they take for granted the tendency of newbies to get excited about selling as prices are dropping ignoring all that comes in the way? Yeah baby! The poor sellers had no idea they were selling straight into the 128 RN. Round numbers are very good hide outs for pro traders. Options for instance revolve almost entirely around round numbers. So we have a bullish fake out setup heading straight into a lot of traffic making us think that pros have gone nuts when essentially they have managed to kill 2 birds with the same arrow. They were able to drop part of their load, and by allowing the fake out setup to fail they lured in more sellers and dropped the remaining load at even lower prices and at even better liquidity levels (more sellers to buy from). Master stroke eh? How do you see that on the chart. By simply noticing that although the wick has been filled in price has failed to close below the low of the fake out setup hence creating a fake out within a fake out setup. Oh well, what kind of load did the pros have that it actually took so much of selling to counter? The answer lies in the bullish wave that followed. ***----------------*** I know this sounds all complicated but the James16 thread has helped us to understand what's going on, without having to lift the curtain to see what's actually happening behind the screens. All we ever really wanted to know was pin bars headed into traffic are a no go. Then concepts like fake outs and implicit divergence further just systematize all these ideas and present them to us in a more simplified form. I was thinking of skipping this latter half of the post but your question seemed to targeting the order flow dynamics behind this particular situation hence I just wrote it down. PLEASE DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN OR HURT YOUR BRAIN IF YOU DON'T QUITE GET IT AT THIS STAGE. As long as you're understanding the fundamental concepts and the functional tools we are using here like the HHR/LLS regions, HCR/LCS levels, explicit and implicit divergence, round numbers and concepts of support and resistance, you are doing really well. Well enough to make all the difference to your trading. Its nice to know why you're doing what you're doing but that part of the knowledge isn't meant to hurt naive brains. g.

hey Steve, I see what you mean. You may be pointing to a fake out per say, and by the hard core definition but whats always more important in the market is the "visuals". What gets seen, is what gets traded. Fake outs are all about the pros getting to work and its unlikely they are basing their decisions on miniscule pip differentials. I always tend to simply ignore and not even consider such fake outs as fake outs. I.e ones that have extremely strong and authoritative closes and which represent fake outs only if you really zoom in down to the last pip. I like to ideally see some kind of a wick formation or better still a pin bar to know the pros are at work. We don't have order books in FX to see what orders are coming in. When the chart is all you have its a good idea to make sure everything "looks" in order g.

yeah well that just shot off. I took full profit off the the 1.5 BRN but its nice to see this take off. USD/NOK proved to be more fruitful as it got a better bite on the USD sell off. This was worth 3.6R based on an entry just under the HHR, a 50 pip stop and a 180 pip gain. (Yes my stop on this one, was not beyond the fake out high. 6.2000 in confluence with the HHR privided nice additional padding for a tighter stop ) g.

My Brain hurts as it has been trying to get a handle on the fake out-Fake out. But somewhere a dim light glows in the darkness of my mind &amp;, it thinks,"You can feel it all around you, when you pay your taxes" Certainly is an orchestrated sense of reality, that is being painted on these charts.

Re-read the first few pages of charts and examples, and ran across this on NZD/JPY. We have a S/R area around a D1 HCR (and later also LCS) level. Seem like a good place to watch out for an H1 SFP?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
You mean the area with the purple line on my chart? The short side of that swing, right now, is just too small. Also, note the lack of space to the FTA and these consolidation boxes on the left.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I have been thinking about What Ghous was saying about filling in the wicks, all the time I was driving to the airport at 120 Kph. Life in the fast lane. Not sure if, I am going off track here or even convincing myself of a phenomena that is not there, by thinking about it so much. Anyway it is all in the chart.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Ah, I should have been more specific...I meant around the 79.75 level, as indicated by the blue box in my first chart. A swing into there from where price is now would be well a decent amount above the D1 ATR.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I have got to learn this patience and chilling on the daily chart, without flipping TFs like pages of a girlie magazine. Please teach me how to go about this Ghous!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Ah, I see. Well, if price gets back up that far, it is going to put it back inside the channel. I don't like trading channel like that once it has already broken out and retracted to the high. It as you say, an S&amp;R or PPZ area but, there is no space because of the way that channel snaked slowly upwards.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Not sure if I get this, Could you please rephrase what you just said Steve? g.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
umm....by simply not flipping the pages of the girlie magazine. Seriously though, I have always loved the soothing nature of daily action and while my adventure buds have distracted me often, some hits always get me back on track. I, like most others, couldn't understand trading if it meant taking anywhere less than 20 trades a week and at least 6-8 hours daily in front of the charts. With a lot of trial and error I realized I just wasn't meant to be a day trader. Every time I took serious hits because of over trading, over analyzing or just simply going crazy looking at setups pop in and out by the hours, I was advised to go back to the dailies by the seniors at the James16 thread and that would always prove to be a soothing and relaxing balm. I could ponder over my mistakes, take deep breaths and just relax and take some time off charts to clear my head in between the long waiting that was required in between setups. Obviously this only came about when I had detached myself from needs of crazy returns in excess of 20% a month. By this time I had obviously learned to not hold any expectations and simply just flow with the market action and take what was on offer. It took some time but eventually I decided I wanted that soothing balm over me all the time instead of only when I got the cuts and bruises. The dailies made sure I had a life and wasn't required for a straight 8 hours in front of the charts. This was important for a uni student and also for some one living in the third world country with more than 6 hours of daily "announced" electricity outages and quite a few hours of surprises to to top that. Also this went well with my personality. Some people enjoy being bombarded with setups and getting involved with the moving market by the minutes and seconds but I began to enjoy the highly accurate and reliable action of the dailies even if it was a little slow. Spreads are less of a problem. Broker tricks are less of a problem. News spikes and noise are less of a problem. I love my higher TFs The daily closes here at 2 AM and despite setting alarms and getting up in the middle of the night to make my trading decisions I have just come to understand that my personality as well as my circumstances suit the higher time frames trading. hope this helps. g.

I am not sure what it is you don't get. The Matrix (Pun) quote about artificial manipulation of the markets or, the chart? Thanks for your detailed explanation as to why you changed your trading. Still not sure how you are entering, are you touch trading these. I am wondering if this chart would be a good example of an area you may look at. I know the pair is not great either in pip value nor conformity. If I get you right, if the high of this chart and the former double top, gets taken out but price closes below the highs, you will enter short? Is the shape of the bar important as in you are going to look for a bearish pa bar or, just the close?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I didn't understand the chart you posted as in what exactly were you trying to show. And I am not touch trading. Touch trading refers to anticipating action at a level and executing the trade at the source. So a touch trade would mean that I would say go short as price touches the HHR. Instead I am actually waiting for a bar confirmation. I am waiting for a bar to test the order flow beyond the HHR and then falling back and closing below without any major support at the HHR. The shape of the bar matters as I like to see a protruding wick (though it doesn't necessarily mean I am only looking for pin bars) as opposed to strong authoritative close on the fake out bar (even if that close is within the HHR). The chart you just showed represents a situation I would be interested in except that this looks like non-fx and I haven't yet ventured with this method on to other markets. I have no doubt that it should work but I still can't vouch for it obviously. g.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I will go back and read your posts on the GU. EDIT: Ok, so I am thinking that, the GU is basically a Daily SFP and validated in the same manner. Just that you are not using the ATR SL. And apart from you just mentioning you look for a long wick on the fake out bar, this is basically the recipe. Is this correct? Hmm, but come to think of it, did you not enter before that bar close?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
No I actually entered a little later than the daily bar close. the 2 AM alarm was of no use that day as I was up almost the entire night swatting mosquitoes and wiping sweat off me due to an electricity outage that lasted the entire night. I was hoping and praying all the time that the train wouldn't leave without me. I ended up getting in about 4 hours after the daily close. Fortunately it got me a slightly better price than the daily close. But in "normal" circumstances I enter on the daily close unless the close is way off from the HHR/LLS. An example would be the USD/NOK trade. You can see the second bar of the fake out bars actually closed way under the LLS. I hence placed a pending short a few pips below the LLS. Here's a chart from my archives. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Ok Ghous. 1: So, you are using the SP as we would in an SFP, just that it was not an SFP because price closed above the SP? 2: You are waiting for the next bar to close and watching where it closes? If this is correct, I will continue? Please see chart.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I got a few PMs asking for my entry reasoning on GU and NU short. Both scenarios are a form of rounded retest. Previous support turned into resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Ghous! - I know how much of your precious time can be consumed by such a post! I appreciate it A fully detailed answer - 100% what i was looking for. I will read it a couple more times I guess... And no, - this new information doesnt make me dizzy. With this i just realize how much i still have to learn before thinking of going live... In the last 1 week i have learned a LOT from you guys. (Cheap joke there - lot, and LOT haha ) It's always a good thing to get new things in our toolbox - so that at demoing or back-testing I can have more aspects on what is happening and why Thank you guys! (You will see this sentence in the next years many many times ) Take care, Stephen

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I want to see price take off above an HHR. I want to see it get rejected. I want to see it close back under the HHR with ease (i.e without using the HHR as support too much). Ideally you want all this action to take place within 1 bar so that it gets contained inside a wick formation. In some cases such as the USD/NOK you get the same action very clear and obvious off a great location with good space only that it happens in more than one bars. In this case it happened on 2 bars. I consider such situations as well but like I said these are rare. g.

Hi, I had a question about this trade. When zooming out on the charts at the time the trade was made it looks like price was still in a downtrend since around June 17th and was still making lower highs and lower lows. In this context isn't it risky to go long at this point?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Cannot complain about a lack of good setups today. USDCAD with a RR at a very nice level. Edit: Very quick run to the target Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Helius! Sorry for bothering, but im kind of confused with your charts. - What was the story behind you GU and NU trades? They were not 3 touch + rounded retests cuase on your chart I only see two touches. Could you give us some more detais? (+ Could you bit explain your UC trade as well?) - What is the trade history indicator you are using? Would you mind sharing it? Thanks! Have a pipful day! Stephen

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Based on my rules a setup does not require 3 touches. I found this during backtesting. I have taken hundreds of rounded retest trades using forextester and the way I play them in regards to SL and TP 3 touches are not required. A valid level for me exists if it has acted as BOTH support and resistance in the past. You can see this very nicely on the UCAD trade. Saying this, you gotta find out how to play any trade setup on your own. You cannot just copy a "system" and expect it to work. Every personality is different and you will trade the exact same setup different then me, ghous, pinbar and anyone else. So having some fixed "rules" is good, as long as you can varify that over the long run you can trade it profitabily. No matter if it's 1, 2 or 3 touches... For the trade "indicator". Just open your terminal on mt4, click on one of your trades in your history and drag them on the pair and you will see it.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi Not at all, quite the reverse actually. I know that may sound totally alien to what you have probably been taught. The fact that it was making LHs &amp; LLs helped to put the breakout traders into short positions just above where the order flow was set to flip, with major buyers coming in. The people short on that trade had their positions Reversed when they either closed the trade or their SL got hit. This means that, both the big guys and the millions of little guys were then pushing in the same direction, Up. This is what trading the order flow is about. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Nice one Helius The FTB to the 150 EMA was great confluence. Now we have a daily close below the WLCS, we may see a push down to the H1 SP for an SFP.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Ok Ghous I am building a chart to get imaged in my brain. This is correct, so far right? EDIT: I also posted a GU setup which, if I am on the right track, was not an entry?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hey Steve, As a rule price must close within the HHR and not necessarily under the previous bar's range. Since in this case you have marked out the HHR in confluence with the previous bar's high, naturally for this case price must close within the prior bar's range. So for instance, with the Gu setup you mentioned, Its a very valid fake out setup because price closed under the HHR (the top most dotted line you drew) but the previous bar's range is way under and it obviously didn't close within the prior bar's range. However, as much as it is a valid fake out setup its not a very good trade setup. There isn't much for price to go for because of the 150 EMA in confluence with the 1.55 RN coming in the way. It nevertheless did what it should have as price tested this FTA nicely before it took off. g.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I see there is some confusion about the way I trade. I'll get to this later today and formulate a post that explains exactly what I look for when I am trading. It really is pretty simple and straightforward. My bad I have just been randomly throwing trades and charts around the thread. g.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Sounds great Ghous

--- 帖子 #262 ---
The first thing I'd like to clarify for those still a bit confused is the most important horizontal line for me that is the decisive factor for each and every trade that I take. HHR = Highest High of Resistance. This is simply the highest visited price in a period of resistance. Its the last price that was traded before price turned around. It goes without saying that such price levels are critical when price returns to them as it straight away refreshes good and bad memories and lead to all kinds of actions. Attached Image LLS = Lowest Low of Support. This is simply the lowest visited price in a period of support. Its the last price that was traded before price turned around. Attached Image An example of a chart with both HHR and LLS levels marked: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ******---------------------------------***** What I am looking for is for price to penetrate the HHR/LLS levels and end up closing back within these levels. Here are a couple of examples: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) How much should price penetrate the the HHR/LLS level to be valid? Enough to visually spot it without having to use the cross-hair and actually measure pips. Since I mostly trade the daily time frame this usually means at least 10 pips or so. Again depends on the pair and I normally don't like to specify the rules in terms of pips. As long as I see a "wick" beyond the HHR/LLS, the setup is good for me. Some people consider a fake out valid even if it violates the HHR by a single pip that they can make out by comparing say the HHR price with the actual high of the fake out bar. I never do that. While I scan more than 50 daily charts everyday I am not stopping for more than a few seconds on a single chart. This is not because I am in a hurry but more so because if anything is conspicuous it should catch my eye within that small window. Chances are if I am staring at a setup too long it will most likely be a pass. Such a method obviously calls for a lot of visual cues. Also note that in most cases a wick is all that I am looking for. In some rare instances you get the same phenomena (of price going beyond the HHR/LLS only to get rejected and close back within the HHR/LLS) spread across more than one bars. In these cases you don't get a wick, but an actual close say above an HHR and then the next bar/s shooting right back down and closing back under the HHR without finding much support at the HHR. Such cases maybe considered only if the location (confluence factors lining up with the HHR and just the look of the bigger story and spatial concerns) is sound enough. An example would be the USD/NOK trade I took that I posted here at the thread (a few posts ago). It was a fake out comprising of 2 daily bars instead of a single bar's wick but the HHR itself was a HUGE one (very deep and major swing high) with confluence of a major RN. More to follow...

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Entry: Where price closes just within the HHR/LLS I prefer to enter on the close and where price travels more then that (for instance price closing way under an HHR for a short setup) I place a pending order just under the HHR in a hope of a pull back to the HHR before price continues to drop (happens a lot). Either ways the idea is to always execute entries near and around your HHR/LLS levels and never too far from them. This makes sure you get an entry nearer to the "source" and enjoy a good R:R as well as leverage the maximum available space for the trade to breathe in. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Stop loss: Stops normally go beyond the high/low of the fake out bar + spread + a few pips. For HHR/LLS levels that fall in confluence with other factors like RNs and EMAs etc I will sometimes go for a tighter stop in the hope that the HHR/LLS levels should straight away hold. There are other non discretionary methods of placing stops too but I like it to be discretionary because it allows me a tighter stop. Almost the entire method is discretionary anyway so it doesn't pain me too much to use some discretion for placing stops. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Targets: For those of you who drop by the James16 thread you would know how we normally go about managing our trades. We mark out areas of minor and major instances of support and resistance market out bar bar highs and lows (and closes) and simply watch as price goes into them. Additionally we like to keep an eye out for RNs and other stuff like EMAs (I use the 150 EMA) as potential sources of trouble for price. Exactly what I do as price approaches these trouble areas is entirely a function of the strength of the setup, the space I have in general to manage the trade, the strength of the trouble area itself etc etc. I may take a quick profit of the first trouble area, or hold for a potentially longer term trade. I may scale out of positions at trouble areas or reduce my stop slop to eliminate some risk. Again depends entirely on the situation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) *****--------------***** Hope this answers some questions. For all others I am right here. g.

Ghous, Wow, thanks for posting an in-depth look into how you trade these "fake-out" bars. Seems like a similar yet slightly different take on the SFPs. Do you trade them only on D1, or do you look at other TFs as well? - Tyler

Mostly the daily. Very rare for me to take a trade on a different TF. Wasn't like this always. But I am beginning to like the daily time frame more and more. g.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Ghous! Today I spent my all afternoon (16-23h) to read through the whole thread again. It's worth it - so i can recommend it for the other guys to. I feel like 95% of the things are crystal clear however I would have some questions: - As I was reading through one of your amazing chart explanation I noticed that the bard DID close under the LLS. (If you look closely on your chart you see it too.) So i took my MT4 (which is alpari and uses the same closing time as FXpRo , and i look what i noticed. (Apart from the fact that the bars did close below the LLS) Any suggestions? (Look at the pic) I mean such "mistakes" can lead me to a different interpretation of the setup.... Im a bit pissed... - I noticed that your method is very similar to Tom's. You use Daily TF though, and have a bit different SL system, but would that be all? And last but not least: Thank you again!

--- 帖子 #270 ---

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hey Stephen, We are looking at the same feed and the same bars. Different brokers have access to different liquidity providers and that means few minor differences may occur despite having the same close times. Mine closed maybe a pip or two below the LLS but the important thing is that it still left behind a huge wick that made up the story for the setup . Yours seems to have closed bang on top of it. Like I mentioned in the post where I explained my method I largely go with "visual cues" and a pip here and a pip there will normally not shoo me off from the trade. Of course if you are using brokers with different closing times then you might find major visual differences, enough to make or break setups. g.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hey K, This is where a lot of people can get carried away. Trading fake outs isn't all about picking all kinds of swing points in isolation and simply waiting for price to test them and close back within them to trigger trades. I mean from a functional point of view that's exactly what we are doing except that we are making sure we just don't isolate our setups from the bigger picture. What kind of market are we in? Are we trending? Are we ranging? Are we in a tight consolidation? Do any long term PPZs, trend lines, RNs, EMAs add to or take away from the strength of the setup? What kind of space do we have for the trade to move into? Would it be fighting lots of jittery trouble areas or does it have relatively better space to breathe in? What kind of confluence do you have lining up with your HHR/LLS? I see the fake out is off the 9000 BRN which goes in favor of the setup but you can't ignore the fact that a long trade here is fighting a hugely dominant down trend specially when its coming off such a shallow swing low. IF we had a really long term swing low lining up here at the 9000 from the past, then you would have had a better case at your hand. If you look at the last few posts that I made, I explicitly mentioned that price likes to take the path of least resistance. With such dominant trends that will very often be the direction of the trend it self. The wicks of fake out setups can comfortably get filled as they often represent profit taking and just clearing the path of any negative order flow. Here the 9000 changes the story a tiny bit, because obviously its a MAJOR RN. But as conservative traders aiming for consistency, you want as many factors tipping in your favor as are necessary as opposed to getting lured in by one or just a few going in our favor. Hope this helps. g.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Great Explanation of your fake out bars Ghous. I am going to take some time, to contemplate all that you have so kindly shown us in great depth. Many thanks for your wonderful contribution to the thread . One question though, in the entry chart you posted, you wrote on the chart "Fake out bar closes way above the HHR". Was that a typo and you really mean LLS?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Oops. Yes. I'll correct it. EDIT: corrected.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Just thought I was not understanding something important there. LOL Thought it was due to all the Beer, Chinese Liquor and Rum I drank last night. While cats away, the mice will play. My wife is 500 miles away, in Shandon till Tuesday. This could be an interesting area. The 1.700 is a bit too close though but that double top is nice. Many thanks again Ghous

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Ghous, many thanks for your replies. 50+ charts! Can I ask you how do you do the scanning? Do you do this with meta trader or some other application? (My alpari account has 37 pairs to choose from) Paul

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I do this with meta trader. I Use Fxpro to watch maximum charts. g.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Do you also play with exotics? Like USDPLN, EURHUF etc. Or you ignore them due to their huge spreads etc.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Yes. One advantage you get trading the dailies is that the pip margins enlarge so that some of the exotics also fall into the tradable range category. Some will still be untradable though because of ridiculously high spreads. They will nevertheless stay on my radar as simple "watch only" charts and setups. g.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
some food for thought. Markets usally follow a random walk. A traders job is it to find patterns that make these random moves less random and play the probabilities accordingly. How random are Support&amp;Resistance levels? Check this video and try it YOURSELF. You will be amazed and puzlled for sure. Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Interesting but i dont get the point??? I doubt theres much randomness in a company/bank spending 10 million euros!!?? (however it might look on a 5min chart) i havnt tried but i wonder if the random lines look the same on a daily chart?? jus my thoughts jon

--- 帖子 #283 ---
valid. I tried it on all timeframes and it "works". However, as often as level hold they will fail. Research suggests the eye is naturally drawn to the areas where a level worked and we tend to put more focus on a level that held in previous history. The main message of the video and the exercise (which I highly recommend doing) is in my eyes: You will always find examples when levels worked. No matter how random they area. The real trading decisions are made on the hard right edge of the chart. Just a line drawn in the sand alone will never be enough to enter a trade and there are endless factors to be considered when trading off of levels. - how did price react last time we were at the level - why are we back at the level in the first place? obviously the demand (or supply) wasn't strong enough last time (one of the most critical aspects to consider) - this leads to: the more often we are at the same level the weaker the level becomes !!! (contarry to conventional believe) - how are we trading into the level - what are my rules for entry, what is the kind of confirmation that gets me in the trade ...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Nice Idea, But I don't agree with the conclusion of your little exercise.What this shows in my oppinion is just that S/R is everywhere.No matter where on your chart you mark an area there will be a price flip or some S/R area in the vicinity,especially in a ranging market.Try randomly marking areas in a strong trending market and you will see less of them look valid.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi guys - on EURCAD 07.9 07.10 i saw a fakeout was it a possible fakout trade? Though we trade right into another PPZ but still - that next day bar did its job (But due to the FTA and the length of the fakout our R/Rn would have been bad so i think it was a no, right guys?) GBPNZD the same... It seems it worked out... These fakout things are nothing but 2 day pinbars - so the underlying order flow is the same In this case we had a bit more space... Thanks for your feedback Stephen

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Ghous Just wondering if you have any criteria you use to validate a swing point in terms of strength or size? It appears from your example of the long setup that, you are looking for swing points that are off a significant former PPZ area, as in the consolidation box I drew. Do you use any other validation method based on the size of the swing or possibly something else? I realize that space to the FTA is going to be an important factor. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #287 ---
That's a very minor swing low Stephen. I need them to be deeper then that. And GBP/NZD...I see no fake out setup (maybe you can show us via a chart what you are looking at) g.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hey Ghous. here was a beauty. Not too much space to the FTA but it rocked right through both of the nearest ones.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I entered this trade. I clearly remember that I said "Okay - double bar high, that is supposed to hold - im taking the risk" so SL was above the left eye (its something that im testing recently - with that i try to maximize my R/R) and the funny thing is that at alpari my SL was hit ... It's weird to see that at FxPro that would have been a winner trade. And what a winner trade... (With that small SL) And imo it was not a bad trade. I mean We had divergence, swing high, pinbar, SFP, and we had some space (that bullish bar) - so i though if it breaks at least i can manage it to BE before it would kick back...)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hey Steve, Great question and post. Once again its all visual for me but the swing points have to deep. And by deep I mean there must be space for you to play around in. Being off a major PPZ or Round number isn't always a requirement (for instance when you have deep swing point and adequate space) but when you do get all these confluences it ensures you are lined up with the bigger story and that is what qualifies for A+ setups. I am not sure if this would make sense but you've got three scenarios. Either the bigger story is bullish, or bearish or neutral. For a long setup you've got an A+ trade if the story is bullish an average setup if the story is neutral (or not bearish) and a bad trade if the story is bearish. That's far too general I know but to just give you an idea of how I am looking at things when I am scanning charts. g.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
It was probably the widening spread. I think Ghous would have probably entered on the pullback to the HHR.

Hey Steve, remember we discussed this here: and here: We also discussed how setups can start off as average and then become really tradable based on the unfolding action here: This setup was pretty mediocre to start off with only because of the lack of space. (I liked the swing point and loved the pin bar plus we had a RN in confluence with the HHR too) We discussed how it was headed into former bar lows and was a pass for now. What I was eager to see was how price had to react at those bar highs forming the FTA. The knee jerk reaction came in and we straight away saw a bounce (nail biting time if one was in a trade). But then the HHR held true and price actually closed back within the HHR and that too on a bearish note. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Up above you have an HHR lining up with a RN and a beautiful pin bar. Dow below you have a close by FTA that has proven once that it may not be rock solid. Notice how the bar after the pin bar left a little wick to the downside. The initial expectation was to see price fill that in and then use that momentum to attack the FTA again. A little aggressive approach would have been to see if the FTA was to push price back up before killing the trade (which would have meant that the drop lower would have kept you in and hence gotten you more pips) but being the conservative me that I am, I just took the full load off at the FTA. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

This had to be an aggressive trade because it had quite a few things going in favor but a critical factor (of space) going against it. It makes sense to be a little more conservative with your trade management if you take on an aggressive/average setup while pumping up the R:R on A+ setups. King Jarroo says: "Great setups are very often high momentum setups" - You can use that to your advantage Think about it. Going tight on average trade means one of two things. Either you're looking for it to really work in your favor straight away or you're worried about taking a bigger/full bar loss on the trade. If that's the trajectory of your thought process why bother getting in, in the first place. g.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I am going to take some time to get my mind around this. Thanks for that explanation of the setup, you were in it, I see. I also need to take some time to get used to how you are playing the bar that is after the Fake out. Totally agree that the FTA is the first thing to dissect and make sure it is not going to bounce too much. Got to run Will read all the above when I get back. EDIT: Looks like it could be going to the 1.2500 area.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
This could be sweet it goes down more and opens up some space, before testing this level.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I got it master! Just as in this case: The trade didnt have much space as we can see it on the next bar: It tests the (minor) FTA and closes above it. However seeing not a great momentum start I might would think " This is not how it should have been - lets reduce risk" - but bamm my SL is already on the last reasonable level that means something to the market - aka. I cant move my SL down... Thanks for the feedback- i will do my best Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #297 ---
However, the above setup needs some waiting and space. The one below has the space &amp; a triple bottom. Should be plenty of punters, waiting for that to break. All we need now is price to get there.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
is it cool to post some charts? I'm watching these levels this week.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Absolutely! Nice levels there. g.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Pinbar! As far as I remember you had some troubles of price breaking through Weekly or monthly levels on lower timeframes i just happened to watch a basic jarroo video and he says "we don't want price to close below on the daily timeframe - on 1H 4H they can but on daily they cant" -&gt; and this just the same what Ghous told us. Hope this helps something Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #301 ---
No idea about what you are talking about. Jaroo doesn't care if they break through or not, either way it is a signal. You are probably confusing the daily PBT&amp;CA or B with the daily signature. Which video were you watching? Of course, after PBT&amp;CB on a weekly TF, we want to see the daily close below the area on the pullback, this is the Daily signature but, if an H4 bar closes above after his short entry. He will cut the trade, he will not hold onto it hoping it will move in his direction. This is what PBT&amp;CA or B is all about. Ghous is also looking for a daily signature, of a close below at the HHR. I really have no idea of what you are trying to say.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Looks like we could get the push back down to 1.1375

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yes, of course it is cool to post your charts. Looks like you have a good understanding of the levels we are looking for.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hope others can see the relationship between Jarroo's HCR+LCS and what Ghous is teaching us about his HHR &amp; LLS. They seem to both be closely linked in the bigger picture.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Another one on my watch list.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
This leads me to wonder if, there are going to be more people paying greater attention, to the LLS than the LCS. Simply because, the LLS will be visible on all TFS, the low of the weekly is also going to be a daily and even lower LCS. However, a Weekly LCS is not necessarily going to be a daily or H4 LCS. Now, I am going to spend what free time I have today, thinking about the wick filling that Ghous mentioned. EDIT: I'd like to ask Ghous about the scenario on the chart and if bar b had closed as I drew bar C, would he not have entered short? I imagine he would not.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Minor Swing Points vs Major Swing Points. Just to help any new people looking at this thread and seeing swing points that are not trade-able. Here is why the minor swing points are not an option.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
yes of course if bar B looked like your bar C then that wouldn't have been a trade because price essentially wouldn't have closed under the HHR. Bar A closing strongly above the HHR was no issue as long as the next bar shot down equally strongly. It still was reminiscent of the kind of action I am looking for. A bar closing above is not so much of a problem if the next bar can drop under the HHR without creating a fuss of it. The bar C you drew, was going to make a fuss of it by holding up via support at the HHR. That would have raised flags. g.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
WOW! Brilliant steve! g.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Love your clean charts Paul, good stuff.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I get the idea now. Basically as bar A is the fake out bar and bar B fills it in on the way back down without finding support, it is another bearish sign. Many thanks Ghous, you are making this thread a fantastic place for me and others to learn!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Just scanned 60 something charts and there is not a lot around at the moment. Not even sure what these two are but they look interesting from a learning point of view.

I've a 20 pip spread on that one! staying away

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Its all relative Mr Kerins, I show on FXCM a ranging spread between 55 and 110, but the 20 day ATR is 1671 and it's only 1 penny per pip FXPRO says spread is 120 IG has it with a spread of 95 and minimum contract size 5 pence So if you have a spread of 20 your laughing all the way to the bank.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thanks for the clarification T. I will check it out.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
This looks interesting on the monthly.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Crude tested HHR 5 times but could not break above it. Would this be a great opportunity to go short?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
That is brilliant. Your chart doesn't show the fact that the swing point you pointed out is in fact a minor one "per se". It actually marks the point of a final retest of a consolidation box at an extreme swing high, after which price literally dropped like a stone. This area marked the point from where price "really" turned around. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also like how price failed to close above the HHR despite 5 consecutive attempts. By the look of it price is squashed between the HHR and the 105 RN. See the bearish bar from yesterday threatening to fill in the wick of that IPB (bullish pin bar at a swing high)? Well it should do that today. This should bring it into contact with the 105 RN again and that's where price IMO will give you a tip off as to whether a bearish move is on the way or not. If price struggles to fill in this wick and finds trouble at the 105 region I would get skeptical about maybe leaving a trade at the initial stop loss. I would like some risk alleviation straight away. Should price drop down and close under the 105, you may have caught a brilliant down move bang at the source Attached Image (click to enlarge) Oh and BTW, no I haven't traded it. For religious reasons I can't trade commodity futures (and I haven't gone beyond non-fx with this stuff anyways) PS: Is that your car and your yacht? g.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I trade 1 hour SFPs and rounded retests. Based on the daily chart, and if you could trade futures, at which daily bar would you have entered? I guess you would not have gone short at the 1st test of the HHR as you would have likely got stopped out on day 2. Is there a reason not to enter at the end of day 1? Is it because the wick of the daily candle isn't long enough? In day 2 price tested above the HHR again and found sellers. Would this be the sign to go short? Would your sell order would be placed close to HHR level? PS: car yes, yacht no.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
EG looks like it doesn't really know which way to go. This is not a setup I am looking at because of the severe lack of space to the FTA. Just trying to get a hint from the bars as to what will go down here. We now have a BEOB going straight into the PPZ.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I am liking the looks of this. Maybe Ghous will like this area also? The swing point is not very big, that what it has going against it however, it is a long term PPZ with the 4.8500 RN, the 61.8 fibo &amp; the TL. Let's see what happens. EDIT: Removed the orders as, we can not know if this is going to be a fake out, till we get the bar close.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hello Pinbar! I'm not sure if I get your post 100% so let me tell you what I understood. Every time we get an SFP Bar (a bar that exceeds the former high but fails to close above it.) it becomes the new HHR? What is PCA SFP? - you meant price closes above the old sfp level but it couldn't close above the new HHR? Sorry for the stupid question but i just wanna make sure i dont misunderstand anything Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #325 ---
This one had the confluence factors that get me excited always, but I guess the lack of space above due to the lower range of the consolidation box plus the 150 EMA killed this one. g.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Been away from the markets and forums for a while and just saw this. Will definitely be reading and chiming in from time to time.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
There is a reason to not enter on Day 1. You are right. Its because the length of the wick is just simply not long enough and while we do have a rejection the fake out bar still has closed relatively strongly with a small wick. Not enough information to create a strong enough bias to pull the trigger. I would have entered on bar 3/4. This is when we had strong rejection off the HHR (decisive rejection) on bar 2 and the next two bars pulled back to the HHR. The stop would have been above the fake out bar high. As mentioned previously The 105 level was always going to be crucial. Notice the rejection off it. BANG! A BE, Minor loss, minor profit - all acceptable. A full bar loss? g.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
We had the fake out off the level (double bar fake out) and the very next bar pulled back to your level before taking off. I don't look for entering trades on second pull backs (where they have time and space in between) g.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Wow! It would thrilling to have you on board D Can't wait to see those charts from you g.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
check it out

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I do not think that the fake out bar low, which is always lower than the LLS or higher than the HHR is the "New HHR or LLS". Take a look at the chart about entry on a Long that Ghous posted and note he explains that if the fake out bar closes considerably above or below LLS or HHR, he will enter on an order placed near the HHR or LLS to get in close to the HHR or LLS. He even says as much, on the chart, "Fake out bar closes way above the LLS" If it was, there would NEVER be an entry to have, would there now? Entry: Where price closes just within the HHR/LLS I prefer to enter on the close and where price travels more then that (for instance price closing way under an HHR for a short setup) I place a pending order just under the HHR in a hope of a pull back to the HHR before price continues to drop (happens a lot). Either ways the idea is to always execute entries near and around your HHR/LLS levels and never too far from them. This makes sure you get an entry nearer to the "source" and enjoy a good R:R as well as leverage the maximum available space for the trade to breathe in.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Thanks Ghous Now I know to ignore the STB to the level.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Here's how I'm using jarroo's stuff playing the weekly EUrAUd BUOB, which closed above 2 weekly HCRs. I like to use 4H to target retrace entries and stop positions for daily and weekly closes above/below their respective HCR/LCS levels. This one didn't move away from the level as much as I would like, but I will check in at LO and make a decision on whether to sit tight, reduce risk or close out. Weekly level and PA Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4H entry and stop placement Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Donkey, great to see you here. Interesting take you have with the HCR2 there. I am assuming you are using this to verify a continuation setup? As in the Weekly BUEOB.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
This was a nice pullback to the level. However, the 1 pip close below the HHR would have concerned me.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thanks pin. Yes I use HCR/LCS levels in confluence as a sign of a higher probability set up - in this case a continuation. When the bar closes above the highs associated with the HCRs or below the lows of the LCSs, I see that as a sign of strength. Here is an example of a PBTCA a daily HCR with no other confluence...I would not trade this live but I do like watching what happens in real time. Daily chart - close above the level, but not the high (HHR in ghous's method I think) Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4hr - identifying entry, stops, and targets Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Synchronicity again, LOL I am in it and almost at TP. Yeah, I hear you D and totally agree that the HCR combined with the HHR in these swing points, add that extra edge to these setups both in terms of clarity and possibly momentum. That said, I was thinking the other day that, there are going to be more people that are aware of a HHR than a HCR as, the HCR on a weekly TF is not always going to be visible on a Daily chart or lower tf. Whereas, the HHR will be visible. If you see what I mean. Just took full profit off the short.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Very nice....are you in as an SFP setup? Would be interested in hearing your trade reasoning here. When I look at PBTCA/B with no other confluence there's usually a 50/50 chance on if it will work or not, which is why I like the multiples lining up, EURAUD. Although I like to trade the first time back to the level after the close above, it's abit more risky as per jarroo's teachings, the level is not confirmed as an s/r flip until the bar after the breakthrough bar closes and confirms the flip. sorry to ramble a bit.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
You are not rambling at all D, this kind of discussion is what this thread is all about. Not really an SFP, more a ghous fake out. I was not going to hold this for long.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Donkey, I think we are on a similar page here. I know, you know what I am talking about, the diagram is for people who do not know.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Yep we're on a similar page no doubt. One thing that I see trading around these areas is that I have the most success when I reduce risk (not necessarily to BE) quickly. You can catch runners, but price can easily reject quickly at these levels too. Here is another exapmple of a weekly level that could have worked for a quick bounce. This is another one that had little or no confluence to speak of and one that I did not trade. First chart is weekly, and shows the HCR created week of 6/9ish and the second chhart shows the quick bounce the following week on the 4H. Plenty of time to manage the position to take profits or BE. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS nice trade on the dragon!!!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Got it. Thanks Ghous.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Many thanks Donkey Your post tells me that, I am on the right track with the way I am looking at both the HCR-LCS &amp; the HHR-LLS. Funny how we all seem to arrive at the same kind of thinking about these entries. Personally, it was really hard for me to use PA as an entry. For example if we have 150 pip Bearish PB, it was psychologically difficult for me to believe in the bar alone and put the SL above the bar wile entering at the break. This way of looking at levels with the above two mentioned methodologies gives me a much better mentality about it. Here is one I am watching for next week.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Also note that different brokers with different timezones will have different closing time, thus the HCR/LCS levels wont be the same for everyone, WHILE the HHS and LLS WILL BE (maybe on their feed the bar shapes will be different, but the highs and lows should be at the exact same place. (on every time-frame) -&gt; (1) That was my first positive thing with HHS and LLS levels. And just as you well said guys - the close levels (HCR, LCS) are hand in hand with the HHS and LLS levels. F.e. at a jarroo trade a HHS/LLS could be a (and usually WILL BE) a trouble area, while at SFP trades the HCR/LCS levels can be trouble areas. Please correcting if im still missing some important points, and still not seeing the big picture Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I think you've got it. You have to be aware of highs and lows in the market, especially on daily TF and above as there is usually alot of order flow around those areas. It is very important for me for the PBT&amp;CA/B bar to close above the high or low of the respective HCR/LCS bar. I missed a lot of setups early on because I would try to play the retrace back to the HCR/LCS and the train would leave without me. When I looked into these I often saw that the close of the PBT&amp;CA bar was above the previous high (when I was looking for longs). SFP failure also helps identify these setups too. For that reason another way I will play the bar is to enter on the close and place my stop on the opposite side of the the HCR/LCS that I am expecting to act as the support flip area. Hope this makes sense.....off to work in a few minutes, I'll try to post some charts later on.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Thanks for the heads up Donkey! I noticed the same thing - when price breaks through the hight and the former close in one bar that really indicates something. However if it does, where would you enter? Retrace to the former HHR? ("I would try to play the retrace back to the HCR/LCS and the train would leave without me.") About weekly levels - i just realized the same thing. (Unfortunately only after 3-4 months of learning ) - Its useless to play Daily bars on daily ppzs and levels. Marking the weekly levels and then entering on daily Timeframe, (and then managing on daily at the beginning - (BE, take some profit etc) - Well it's just amazing I think the same goes for lower TF trading -&gt; We scan daily ppzs and enter 4H or 1H etc etc... Looking at your charts I see the trading style I want to learn so I think I'm going to PM you during the weekend, so keep your mailbox opened Thanks, Stephen

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Just perfect D. How come we are all led here to the this place of HCR-LCS &amp; HHR-LLS after years of PA &amp; PPZ? Probably because, without the investment in years of time and energy, of PA &amp; PPZ, we would never have understood what it really means, just like life. Great post D. It really fits with the larger order of things. And another great Hug to those that led the blind to this place, meaning, me. That does not mean, I am out of the woods yet!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Where is Jarroo?????? I miss him.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I think you are missing something here. Do you really think playing a daily PA bar at a daily level is useless? J16 does it all the time, so does Mike. You don't see Mike or J16 switching TFs all the time. They work, for sure, that is not the point, the point is something else IMHO.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I have been away most of the week but on market open on Sunday I plugged in my orders. 2 were triggered during the week. USD/JPY is as beautiful as it gets. Print this chart and hang it over your bed. Thus is like the perfect setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZDUSD also a very nice setup. Not as textbook at the one above but still a valid trade.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
This one has all the characteristics of a possible setup.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Okay let me rephrase My point was that the great winners - the A++ winners on daily are much more like to happen at weekly PPZs than daily PPZs... I mean I'm still going to look for daily setups at daily PPZs however I'm thinking of a fast profit taking (1/1 R:R) while at a pinbar which occurred at a weekly PPZ i might let it run for longer. Mike uses the daily TF however many of his trades are on 4H (or maybe 1H) - which are the same methodology as Weekly/Daily Timeframe switching. "total useless was maybe a bit harsh" Have a nice weekend Stephen

Great stuff Helius The old story of price flips and market memory.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I recently read what is behind those Support turns resistance trades. I therefore labeled the chart with 1, 2 and 3. 1) The general public trades long here because we have such a strong support level according to all the technical analysis textbooks. After the break they will be all long facing drawdowns. 2) The people trading with the uptrend looking for targets. 3) The people from (1) will be breakeven when we reach the level again the therefore exit bigtime. And as covering a long means entering a short position, we see short pressure from this group. Plus traders from (2) will also be looking to exit there because it makes sense! Again exiting a long position means entering short. More selling pressure. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Yeah, the order flow and tempting the masses onto the wrong side of the fence. This is what got me interested in the SFP originally. Although, as I am sure you know, Price Action such as a PB or BUEOB is the same manifestation of the bigger scheme, trapping people into a trade, hitting their SL and as you say, reversing their positions for the bigger scheme ahead. Just could never really put 100% faith in PA somehow. Probably because I really did not understand what the real deal behind the PA was. The SFP is really putting the pieces of the puzzle together. That said, I think the big guys also play the same game with the SFP levels, sometimes. Scary when you think that, when we started trading we probably all believed the breakout textbook stuff. Good stuff Helius

--- 帖子 #359 ---
yes. But I am not sure you can cal it scary. "The big buys" have to be positioned in the market. And they have huge money they need to somehow trade. But if they would just sell price would drop like a stone what would in the end cause them to enter for a bad price, giving away profits. So the need to make people believe price will go up. They will buy a little themselves, pushing prices slightly higher because retail is buying (from the big guys) as well (but here they will already start accumulating short positions). Prices wont go far though because when retail buy, they are buying from the big guys which pushes prices down again. This will get repeated time and time and the big guys will try to push prices as high as they can to be able to sell as expensive as possible . That's how SFP are created. Because this will happen at places where everyone will get interested in buying. At some point the big guys will have entered their full position and price will drop like a stone. All the retail traders who are long, will look to cover their longs (going short) which adds momentum.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Yeah, I know how and why it works. It is scary because without a proper understanding of the order flow, we will be on the wrong side of the fence. Of course, once we understand it, we will be on the right side of the fence, most of the time.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Breakouts can still be pretty textbook style. Remember most of the breakout traders who get burned by fake outs are the ones looking to get early on in the bandwagon. An initial entry triggered due to fear of missing the move or the greed/excitement of catching a slingshot at the source. g.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Yes I agree, we see BO's working all the time. It's just how best we see the patterns..... isn't there a T-shirt yet "Contrarians bend your trend" Fuck it's hot.....

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I totally understand the mechanics or rather the mentality behind the breakout traders positions and this complicates matters even further as, people like Mike and J16 will take breakout trades. Yet, my thoughts on the breakout trades they take are not for the same reasoning that the majority of people take breakouts for. I realize that the answer to this question is probably rather complicated but, if I could , I would like to ask Ghous as to the reasons he, prefers the SFP to the traditional PA methodology of trading. Of course, I have my own opinion on this but, would like to hear Ghous'es personal opinion on this matter, if I may be so bold. I think it could help a lot of people, including me.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I take that by saying "traditional PA methodology" you are referring to the James16 basic strategy of trading PA bars. Well, trading fake outs makes me feel I am in more direct connection with order flow trading. Not that that's important but just this association and developing this liking for order flow stuff has got me closer to to trading the fake outs more than anything else. There are some additional perks attached too such as better R:R and getting entries closer to the source (which comes close to the aggressive J16 strategy of playing PA bar retraces) but I hate to get into this traditional vs advanced methodology debate. I hate to sound like this fake out stuff is in some way better than the J16 basic material, or for that matter worse. Its pointless because with trading the only thing that matters is your comfort zone. Its natural to want to feel your trading methodology / edge is superior to others' claims but the real truth is that because it works for you doesn't mean it has to work for every one. Mike (mbqb11 from the j16 thread) has been in love with the very basics of the J16 material since...well...always and while he has added a few advanced systems to it, he primarily still trades those big outstanding pin bars and outside bars at sweet locations. Something newbies do for a couple of weeks before they get bored and get a move on. Does that mean Mike's using a bad strategy? Do you think an answer to this question, whatever it is, would make him flinch or make him give a damn? I don't think so. There is no one size fits all here. We all explore our inner selves and eventually, over time settle with what we are comfortable with and "personally" believe is a true edge which we obviously then test and test again to make sure its not an illusion and truly exists. Whether you trade break outs or fake outs, traditional PA bars or unorthodox fake out bars, it really doesn't matter as long as it is what you are comfortable with and the edge is verified and tested. The traditional J16 stuff is great for beginners and experts alike and should you choose to expand and diversify your knowledge / system as you go along, it provides for a great platform and a launch pad to begin researching in the various aspects of market dynamics. Fundamentals, order flow, you name it. I trade fake outs today and I love them, but I will still give a good 90% credit to the James16 material and the knowledge acquired at the group for where I am today. Had it not been for that strong foundation those order flow threads, and the ability to connect the dots wouldn't have existed. I wouldn't have been here trading fake outs. I don't like to compare the basics with the advanced as these are not two methods at the same level that you can compare. For me, one followed to and got linked with the other and its futile for me to weigh them against each other. g.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Welcome Cesar Note you are marking the lows of the bars with the zig zag indicator, not the Close. those levels LCS from May 2012 do not seem to be respected by price so much in the recent movement of price. I would certainly look at those levels as a PPZ but for the purpose of SFP, I would choose the current range of price HCR &amp; LCS. And, I would pay greater attention to the upper one as, the lower one has already had an SFP. Check out the diagram showing the HCR LCS &amp; HHR LLS

Thanks for the input Ghous. Indeed it is as you say, a comfort zone and basically a belief system that we have faith in, in the sense that, we can place the trade with a reasonable amount of conviction that it will reach our FTA and possible beyond. As you say, it is futile to compare systems in terms of one being better than another and I am in total agreement that the PA taught in the J16 thread is the basis of the order flow. Yet, it was always hard for me to believe in the bars being the order flow, it seemed somehow incomprehensible, verging on mystical, when I first started learning PA. The HCR -LCS and the SFP seem much easier to get a handle on, in terms of the order flow that is occurring around these levels. Thanks again Ghous.

Can you post a chart please Stephen, it helps avoid a lot of confusion.

Some people just can't call it a day until they have jerked themselves in and out of several trades that day. There is a charm I feel that stands a class apart when it comes to waiting for a couple of these setups a month. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Either choose to take all the iffy setups in between these and hope the markets are generous, or choose to always be in control every minute that you are in the market. The market isn't your pet. Its not a loyal dog. Its not there at your service. Truth be told, these setups are extremely rare. Trading the markets may be a skill. A mechanical one too maybe. Making sure you can avoid the clutter and be able to choose the ripest of cherries is where trading inherits its artistic characteristics from. I have always admired trading because at the very core of it, mastering it is a function of constantly striving to conquer your inner demons/emotions and become the strongest version of yourself. Success at trading is actually a manifestation of your success in life. g.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Indeed it appears to have the icing on the cake. Would you call this one an A+ setup?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
That is a brilliant digram pin. That jumps out at me is the SFP candle closed below the HCR you marked. To me that is a perfect example of using the HCR and SFP concept as confluence. The SFP candle in that diagram is a bearish signal, and the inability to close above the HCR is added confluence....high probability setup you have drawn up there.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Thanks D Too bad we can't draw these setups on live charts. LOL Yeah, the Confirmation of the level is always nice to see just before the close of the bar. Yes, this is how I am trying to fit this story together. I knew we were on the same page. Maybe we will see the same phenomena on the EUR/PLN at that M-HCR.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Story on EURUSD...watching not trading....goes back to earlier post about missing entries when the close is above the highs of HCR bar. I will follow this chart with notes on how I consider trading these setups. This goes along with pins diagram as well. EDIT: f'd up original attachment. Basically today we had a PBTCA a daily HCR level and the highs of the HCR candles. The PBTCA candle was also a SFP candle. I'm biased long on this scenario. I think everything shows up on the attached explaining howa few ways to play today's setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thank pin bar for your clarification, I've corrected my LCS / HCR this gives me less entries to the market, but surely, more percentage of success. Could you tell me where I can download the live market hours.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
It is in the forum, search for p4 clock. I would post it but as you can see from the charts, it has stopped working. All the times are wrong. Also, I am outside and using my android tablet right now.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Ghous &amp; Donkey What is your opinion of the possibility of seeing an SFP on EJ at this level? I think, if we do see one at the 1.3400 it may give us a run to 1.3280

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I kind of like this Dual level as, it seems to have been confirmed.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Some interesting thought I recently came across regarding Moving averages. So many people use system that tell them only to buy when price is above your MA and sell when price is below your MA. It's also used as a confirmation within other systems. But what does your MA tell you? The value of an MA, that is shown on your chart, tells you the exact value of your average price of previous trading history. So buying abvove an MA means that you will only buy if prices are above average. Huh!? Yes, pretty stupid. It's like tracking the price of your most favorite car and then when finally prices seem to be very high you are going to the dealer to pay a huge price. Again, it's very obvious that 95% of all traders fail because they don't think about what the charts are presenting them. What is common knowledge and presented in trading books wont make you a profitable trader. Everyone knows these books and the "rules". But everyone fails using that common knowledge!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I think that is a reasonable scenario. I am keenly watching the HCR and associated high I have marked as this is an important area. If we have SFP in that area I would certainly think a run down to 132.8 is likely depending on if any space or traffic is created in the forming of the sfp. Couple of other formations I will be watching for will be another HCR in confluence with the current one or an SFP with a close below the current HCR (like your diagram). Either of these would show strength to the level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Thanks D Just making sure I am not imagining this possible scenario.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Funny, with these HCR LCS levels, I often see an H1 Inside bar straddling the level before it takes off.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
These are the scenarios that always get me nervous. yes we may get a fake out there. But just looking at the very strong trend up and a rising consolidation pattern coupled with no real confluence at the swing high would make me very uneasy personally. Remember that fake outs and wicks that turn out to be false can get filled in very quickly as price then simply finds them to be easier path to flow in to. Like I said a fake out may well be expected here, but is it more likely to encourage some real bearish action or will price just be taking out some stops to clear the path out for fresh bullish order flow? Judging from the information we have available (lack of confluence and a strong up trend along with not that strong and deep a swing high) I would be hesitant wanting to expect the former scenario. g.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Agree Ghous! Also I think the way price is approaching the level is not tempting. When you want to go short the best thing that can happen is when prices rallies into the level. Why? Because for the average retail trader it will look like price is strong and we are in an uptrend and he better buys into it because we will break the level - yiihaaa! But more often than not, this is the way the big guys are trapping the small traders. They are pushing prices up fast but their only plan is to reverse, and sell to all the retails traders that are hoping for the uptrend and the break of a level. No one gives a sh** if price moves slowly. But that is often how a break of a level will be approached! One big odd enhancer therefore is: If you want to sell, look for big rallies into a level. (and vice versa)

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Excellent point! I missed mentioning that g.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
anything on the radar? I can not see any FX pair even close to a decent swing point

USDCAD might be setting up some nice RR. Time will tell

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Glad to hear that it is not only me who sees very little around at the moment. It is probably in times like this that we get tempted into mediocre or even, bad setups. Also, thanks for your take on EJ. Yeah, the trickling back to level did have me concerned as it does not create space to move back through. Thanks to Helius for his take on it also. The only thing it really has going for it is the mid level of the weekly consolidation box which, is also the SP.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Looks like, it is the latter rather than the former.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Quote this one worked out well. Today's low was within 2 pips of the daily HCR. Today's close gives confirmation that the level is now support. This was the type of move I was looking for out of EURAUD that I entered last week, and have since closed at BE. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Food for thought. I am slowly leaning towards the way of thinking that Ghous described. Look at GU, it has been running for weeks &amp; made it to the FTA, STA and is now challenging the TTA. Yeah, we may not find too many trades every month but, so what, if the runners run, we don't need to. If we can stay in the market, with profit locked in and manage the trade, isn't that what it is all about? Jumping in and out of trades on lower tfs, exposes our capital to risk, we pay the spread numerous times and sit like a prisoner, in front of a computer screen biting our nails. Might as well have a job as, it is the same thing only, probably more stressful. As Livermore said, "Sitting on our hands is the hardest part".

--- 帖子 #393 ---
This is how, I am trying to look at the market. It is hard for sure, could be weeks or months, before price gets there and even then, it may or may not give us what we are looking for.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
That was turning out to be a great fake out bar with that upper wick to it! Unfortunately it couldn't close as a fake out. Disappointing really. Interesting to see what price will do next. Now that we have closed under the LLS, is it going to continue its way down, or are bullish orders still waiting for something. THIS IS A HUGE LEVEL, fake out or no fake out this would make for a great case study. :nerd: g.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
price has closed below the LLS by a just a few pips and visually when I am looking at my charts it seems to have closed very nearly on the LLS itself. I am hugely impressed with the location and the look we have on that...well a hard shot fake out bar. Staring at this at 3 am in the middle of the night with an unplayable spread and dodgy close could not enable me to pull the trigger. Now that I am looking at it, and as the more active sessions come into play (reducing the spread) and more importantly the fact that price has shown no real intent of staying true to that close below the LLS I am increasingly confident on this one. Again I typically like to see everything in order but here a close perturbed by a few pips hasn't been able to dump the entire bigger story comprising of hundreds of thousands of pips and almost a year of trading action. This was a no to begin with, but as things are unfolding and because of the wonderful attributes to this setup, I am actually in this one (with half the normal risk) g.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Yes, despite the daily Close, I think this is a strong level &amp;, possibly the M-HCR and consolidation just below the level, is still in play. The Hourly seems to have some kind of story going on this level. Just look at those pin highs.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Please forgive me for asking a question before reading the entire thread first, if you have answered a similar question, and I have missed your answer, I apologise. I am not new to trading but am new to your system and find it very interesting. My question is regarding how you go about identifying and marking up your monthly, weekly and daily levels? In the pages I have read so far, you have described what you are looking for when price approaches these levels but I am still not totally clear on how you identify those levels in the first place. Many thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #398 ---
just go through the thread. There are numerous of charts and explanations. Welcome in the thread btw

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I can only suggest what Helius did. When the thread was only 15 pages long I started it all over again cause I was missing some pieces. I went through every post, VERY carefully, i took a screenshot of the more important posts, highlighted the valuable informations and saved them on my hard drive. Obviously it took some time, but it's worth it... Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Putting too much emphasis on daily close might set you up for troubles... How do you chose the closing time of your daily candles? NYSE closing time? Then you are neglecting London, the Aussies and the asian sessions. Daily candles don't say anthing because every trader will have a completely different chart when it comes to daily candles. Therefore what might be a buy on one broker is a stand-aside on the other - or even a sell on the third broker. Trader in New York use 65-minutes charts to get 6 equal candles during the New York session. The only timeframes that will look 100% identical are 1H, 30min, 15min, 5 min, 1 min.. charts because start and stop periods will always have to be the same. Just something you might consider when putting together your methodology. A daily candle close should always be just the last piece of a puzzle when it comes to entering a trade

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Well, there are several related methodologies being discussed here. One is the HCR-LCS another is the SFP. You identify these levels on the M W &amp; D tfs by using the close of price, sometimes the close and open of the next candle are not the same, in which case you use both levels. The deeper &amp; taller ones. I am just using the weekly level in this example but, it should give you the idea. So, I am not sure which it is you are asking about. Personally, I am trying to combine the two, so it may be rather complicated to explain what I am doing. So I will explain the Lowest close of support in simple terms. If you are talking about identifying the HCR &amp; LCS levels, these diagrams will explain the basics of LCS. The entries are what is complicated to explain because, we are using the levels in different ways. Hope this helps with your question. The SFP is more complicated but, as I do not know which you are asking about, I explained the regular S&amp;R &amp; PA that occurred at this level. See the next post for a simple explanation of the SFP, which is the order flow and the main topic of this thread. HCR &amp; LCS along with Price Action is also the order flow but, as PA is a different manifestation of order flow by its nature, we will leave that for another day. All these methodologies are basically using the order flow, just the entries are different. Hope I am not confusing you further.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Simple explanation of the SFP NB: I am explaining the SFP on the Daily TF but, this pattern is usually traded on smaller time frames.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hey Ghous It certainly filled in that wick quickly.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I like the look of the mini-sized dow better here...There's an SFP on D1; price has been unable to close above the HHR @ 15521. There's also macd divergence. Seems like we might get at least a correction down to ~15300, which could be a great place for a rounded retest.... Just demoing this one...let's see how it goes

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I totally agree Helius, That is particularly why a few pips here and there on the close doesn't normally set me off from the trade if the story is very good. Its all about the location anyways... g.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Once price gave some indication that it was hesitant to go down, up was always going to be the easier path for price to follow. I mentioned earlier I liked that wick on the fake out bar Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I like how it has developed so far, but this is once again very similar to the EJ setup we were discussing a few posts back. You are fighting an extremely strong up trend. Normally with these setups you've got to see some action straight away or they can reverse on you very quickly. Not the kind of setups I am comfortable around simply because I am not used to, and I don't like, to babysit the trickier setups. But I am glad you're on demo which is the right way of going about it. Practicing with trickier setups on demo is the best source of hands on knowledge and understanding of the material that you can acquire. g.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I am watching EU as it approaches this HCR. A bit too much of a zone between the SP and the level though. Still, as we know, PBT&amp;CA very often gives us a retest to the level, this SP and an SFP there, would be a great place for a retest of the HCR, if it breaks through and closes above. Too many ifs though.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Why we want to see price rally back quickly to these levels. Read Ghous's post above, about EJ &amp; the mini dow.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi g! Maybe im missing something again but why did you like the shape of the bar on the EURPLN trade? That was an inverted pinbar I guess... What is the order flow behind such a bar? I guess some buyers come in, they push up the price a bit, but then even more sellers come in and they push it simply deeper, which would tell us that during that day some guys were eager to buy, but they were might to early? Or can it be simply just the news? O.o Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Good question. When in a dominant down trend, you like to see price make its way down comfortably. Nice big bodies and very little lower or upper wicks. When is it not comfortable? When you see small bars "trickling" down and/or see large wicks either side of the bars. What information is a wick to the upper side telling you when price approaches a support zone? Its telling me that price is still trickling down but inertia has set in. price has hit some buy orders straight away (indicating that the support is legit) which has pushed price up. Because price is in a downtrend it is understandable that price goes back down leaving behind only a wick, but this is still valuable information for us because ideally we want to see buy orders coming in at support. This is in fact the rationale behind the IPB. g.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
There are stories strongly in favor of your bias. There are stories strongly against your bias. And then there are neutral stories. Price oscillating in sideways swings not majorly representing one direction very obviously over another can sometime yield some nice short term trades. Here's one I took today. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just a nice decent swing point coupled with space. Notice we don't have any aspects and factors that make up a bigger badder story but we also don't have anything big going against it either. These can be good snacks to munch on while you wait for setups like the EUR/PLN. g.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi g! In the original SFP thread (Fail Better) Tom brings an example of money management. ("guys boxing and how much do you bet if the one of them just broke his nose/is blind etc)... So my question is if you do the same then how? I guess the trade you just took Ghous was an average trade. Yesterdays EURPLN was far from perfect so you took only half. But if you would have seen that EURPLN with a huge pinbar then would you have entered with double/triple position? Thanks Have a nice day. Stephen

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Simple bread and butter trade. 1st target is already hit. The rest is running for the second target. No risk anymore. Support turns into resistance

--- 帖子 #415 ---
The SFP does not utilize PA quite the opposite in fact, they will often pass on a large PA bar. On an SFP we want to get into the trade as close to the level as possible, with a small stop.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
That is basically statistics 101 Would you place more money on a bet that has a higher expected outcome? So, you would enter a larger position on a trading setup that has a higher expected winrate than on a crappy that where you don't know what will happen?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
True, however I would love to know more about your numbers. I mean what is the min/max risk, and how do you manage it accordingly to the trade (I mean A+ - x%, B trade x*0,7% etc.) Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #418 ---
That's pretty easy You just have to go through your trading record. You look at all the trades you made, analyse the setups and give them a ranking. Then you can get your expected winrate. However, you cannot get those numbers from someone else because everyone will trade differently. You might see something that I don't and therefore make trading decisions in an other way. Therefore you need to do it yourself. Just go through forextester and backtest a few months worth of history until you have decent samplesize. Then you can get your expected average return. I got my figures over hundreds of trades. Expected winratio, max drawdown, riskzise, win/loss ratio. Those things are invalueable. You should really take the time to figure it out

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hey Stephen, The EUR/PLN was not far from perfect it actually was very very close to being perfect In fact it was only a few pips away from it. It is rare for me to alter my risk percentage on a particular setup. When needed I will reduce it, but never go double/triple my normal risk parameters. And no a pin bar would not have made me risk more. A nice favorable close on the fake out would have intrigued me into just taking the normal risk on the trade. g.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Spot on Steve. g.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Support turning into resistance. One of the first fundamentals you get taught at babypips. After all those years of trying to find a complex method of nailing the holy grail, it comes a full circle back to the hard core basics. Nice trade Helius g.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
For what its worth, I risk 2% per trade on most trades. Some times I will drop this down to 1.5% or 1% but never beyond 2%. For the most part, its a dichotomy that I face. Either a setup is worth trading or its not. There may be some merit to allocating different risk percentages to different setups but for me the simplicity associated with categorizing the trade as either tradable or untradable works. I am not sure what an A+ trade is and what a B- trade is. It takes me less then 10 minutes to scan through 60+ charts at the end of each day and I am not stopping for more than a few seconds on each chart. If a setup catches my eye during that period I know its in my radar. If it doesn't, its a pass anyways. If its still unclear, it saves me the hassle of looking at a mediocre setup and wondering whether to allocate it a C+ or a C- and following that, whether to allocate 1% of my account to it or 2%. g.

You know when you are trying to open this large door that's jammed because it hasn't been opened in a while. You push at it and it won't budge. And then you wait a bit, gather more people and launch together towards the door and push at it with all the force you have? Poor door, its still only a door. You crack it open or break it to pieces but you still get access to the room you were looking to get into. All these scenarios remind me of this analogy Enough said. g.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Once price started to make a move down, I was looking at a clear path to the blue area I highlighted. The action till then was exactly what I wanted to see. Price hurried into the HHR and got rejected literally within less than an hour. But soon after we see price stall a bit and despite what looks like clear space, price seems to be hitting some invisible hurdles here. If this was true momentum price should have drooled down into the blue area. Because it was showing hesitation for no apparent reason, I had a reason to curtail my risk. Attached Image (click to enlarge) hope this makes sense. g.

Looking forward to seeing the wick being filled on this bar. Once again no real reason for the selling to come in (probably some options at 4.25 instinctively being protected).

Thank you guys for your valuable input! (Special Thanks for Ghous, Helius and Pinbar ) Have you ever guys (especially Ghous) wondered using 2 Day fakeout at a PPZ? I mean we got a minor Weekly or major Daily PPZ and there we see a 2 day fakeout where price first closes below but then on the next day it clearly closes above this level. As I have noticed lately at these "trades" we can have a nice shoot for 1:1 R/R or so. OR you guys only look for 2day pins (aka fakeouts) at major swing lows / swing highs. Helius! Thank you very much for your feedback. Hopefully during the weekend I can sit back a bit and I can start playing with forextester. Thanks, Stephen

Hmm, I am thinking perhaps, I could have entered the #BA at the open of the Daily Gap candle and played till it filled the gap. Or is this just my mind trying to lure my hands from under my butt? LOL

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hey Stephen, Normally I am looking for a single bar fake out only, but in rare circumstances, when the location is sound and there are other elemants of the bigger story supporting the case I may go for a double bar fake out. An example would be the USD/NOK trade I shared here at this thread a little earlier. g.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
and here goes the DAX. We did not see a rounded retest yet, but an "immediate" retest after the break of the level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Yes it can get tough. Specially if you can't take your eyes off the charts. if you can't walk away and let the markets do their thing. Not saying you're doing this Steve, but a lot of people who complain about getting bored between the big gaps is because they are coming off from a shorter time frame mentality and are used to being in on the action all the time. And I have been there and done that. Over time though I have started to actually appreciate and like the freedom that the higher time frames provide me with. I know I am still making money while doing anything that I want off the charts. Yes this is not an advantage to a trader overly obsessed with charts but then you need your priorities sorted out. I have always believed that there actually do exist separate categories of traders. The high frequency and the low frequency traders. And no its not something that stems out entirely from the trading method. It has its roots deeper into the personality of the individual traders and the unique comfort zones. When I started off God knows, I was scratching my head off during the potentially long waiting periods in between trades but some time down the road I have begun to like it...correction...love it. Its the virtue of patience that you exhibit during these dry periods that can ultimately determine your long term success and demarcate the thick line between a real trader and a wannabe trader. g.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Yes, they are tricky and they will reverse on you a lot. That's why I play them with a very tight stop and a risk:reward ratio of at least 1:7 cheers This way you only need a winrate of 13% and you will still make money

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Yes, you are right Ghous, the problem at the moment is, I always feel I am going to miss an entry on the daily tf, that is probably why my mind started thinking, I could have traded the #BA gap. So, you mean, we should wait for a monthly confirmation on #BA, just a close below the HHR or another possible stab at the HHR? Thanks for sharing your wealth of knowledge you have accumulated

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I am noticing that before a bearish SFP, very often, we will get a small IB prior to the test of the HHR. Before a bullish SFP, we seem to get the IB after the test of the LLS, at least on EUR/NZD. I suppose is natural as, price is putting the brakes on but somebody is pumping the accelerator occasionally to get price back to the HHR or LLS.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
That could be another reason, why we don't want to see price hanging around just above or beneath these levels but, want to see momentum into the level.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yeah at least a monthly close below the HHR. g.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Yes Steve, but I wouldn't generalize this. IBs are quite common all over the place and it really depends on the individual scenario what an IB is really indicating. g.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi, what do you think of USDCAD?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Yeah, I don't want to hypnotize myself with IBs. I have a question about the HHR, once violated as in #BA, do you consider the area between the New High and the old HHR to be No mans land? Maybe, you even have a term for this new high, apart from the sfp?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Well it just creates a new HHR point for price returning to the fake out high some time in future and then it will have to make a move above that new HHR (which previously was a fake out to the older HHR). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hope this makes sense. g.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi PinBar, Many thanks for starting this thread. It has drawn my interest to the Jarroo's method. One of the main things I still struggle with though is where exactly to draw the HCR's/LCS's. Initially I thought it should be at significant swing points, however, I have seen many drawn by Jarroo and others at areas that do not look like swing points (not even minor). Your explanation/advise on this would be most appreciated. The one thing I very much appreciate about you is the way you try to explain things as simple and clearly as possible with your charts and diagrams. One other also is the 'signatures'. If I am trading off daily charts, what time frame should I dropped down to to check for 'signatures', and take my entries?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I know what you mean about sometimes minor swing points are used even though, we are told to look for the deeper swing points. The thing that strikes me is that, not all swing points are equal in their potential. A bigger SP may just as easily break than a smaller one if there are no other confluence factors behind them. Jarroo places much greater emphasis on a consolidation box, HCR-LCS than merely the size of the swing point, I believe. Probably because there are dual or sometimes even triple levels at play. On the point of your entry, I would stick with the H4 tf. As Ghous said earlier in one of his posts, "It is all about your personal comfort zone". Donkey said a while back that he prefers the H4 tf as it is more reliable, I tend to agree. Your question is something that nobody can really answer, you have to forward test both TFs and choose the one that falls into, the amount of free time you have &amp; your personal comfort zone. It is like when I first went to live in Japan many years ago, coming from England and being used to a much greater habitable land mass, I noticed that the personal space afforded to people in Japan was not in my comfort zone. People I did not know, sometimes even the ones I did, would stand way to close to me for comfort. I used to get uncomfortable with the lack of personal space, but I got used to it. We adapt or change our living conditions, it is the same with TFs and entries, I believe. I am currently trying to adapt to the Daily TF, with daily space and FTAs. Here are a few charts of EU which, I think explains what you are talking about. Hope this helps Hopefully Jarroo will pop in and answer some of these question directly, sometime.

I hear you. The old HHR also create an FTA for the new Swing point. Just wondered if you have named them.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Still sitting on my hands but, the four I circled are the nearest to coming into play. I shall watch how the #SQ3 daily bar closes.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
We did partially fill in the wick on Friday but there just wasn't momentum at all. I killed this one just before the markets closed on Friday. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Once again PB, thank you very much for detailed and clear explanation. 1. With regards to TFs, I kind of know which TF I want to stick too, which is the daily because it's better for me due to work commitments and also J16 and most the seniors recommend the daily TF for newbs. My question was that If I was trading the daily TF and using Jarroo's method, what TF should I use to check the signatures, H1 or H4? Also, do I do my entry on the daily TF or drop down to the H1 or H4 for entry? I think the confusion sometimes is that I see you guys get a set-up on say the daily chart and then drop down TFs for confirmation, entries, trade management etc. 2. So just to clarify we can use swing points as well as consolidation box for determining the HCR-LCS? 3. Attached is you original chart, with some of my annotations in red. Are these correct? Much obliged. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Not sure why you say' It "partially filled the wick". Did price no retrace the whole wick of the SFP bar? Or, when you say filled, do you mean closed outside the wick of the previous bar?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
You sort of answered your own question there. If you are trading the Daily levels, you should be looking at only the Daily signatures also, I would use the weekly levels on the Daily tf. Not sure what you mean about using the swing points as HCR. The HCR is always going to be the HCR just as, the LLS is always going to be the LLS. You know, Jarroo touch trades these levels, he is not always looking for PA here. The SFP uses the High or Low of a swing point as an entry.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
This is what I meant: Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi PB, "If you are trading the Daily levels, you should be looking at only the Daily signatures also..." Ok, a bit confused here. I thought if say you have a PBT&amp;CA a DHCR, you then drop to a lower TF, for example the H1 to see whether any H1 bars fail to close above the DHCR, thereby by confirming/giving more strength to the PBT&amp;CA D1 bar? "Not sure what you mean about using the swing points as HCR" Sorry, I did not mean using the swing point as HCR-LCS, I meant the close of the candles at the swing points? Thanks

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Oh so this is criteria for staying in the trade?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Read my posts from earlier. We saw a weak bearish pin bar form, and I was looking for it to get filled in and price to continue itsway north and hit my TP. It only partially filled the wick on Friday and once again closed slightly bearish which is when I decided to kill the trade. g.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Ok, I think I see where your Dilemma lies, here and it is something I posted about previously. A great many people seem to confuse the weekly or daily signature Jarroo talks about with the entry. The signature, is what keeps you in the trade or takes you out, it is not the trigger. The trigger is either small time frame PA,H1 even M15 or a pure touch trade off the level.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I just read the older post, I am with you now on that PB wick. The arrow pointing to the bar prior to the PB is what threw me off.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
PB, Thanks for your replies and patient. So this is the way I currently understand it: Say I am looking at a daily chart, and PBT&amp;CA a recent DHCR (which was drawn at the location of either a recent consolidation box or at the close of a recent swing point). I then drop down to an H1 chart to look for PA candle and if there is one, take the trade. I go back to the daily chart to place my SL, which would normally be some pips under the low of the PBT&amp;CA candle. I then drop down to the H1 chart to look for signatures to manage the trade. Am I on the right track or am talking bullocks?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Generally one uses the Higher Time Frame for a Setup After you defined your Setup you drop down to a Lower Time Frame for the Trigger (Entry) . Which Time Frame you are going to use depends on how aggressive you approach the trade. If for instance you use your Daily Time Frame to scan for Setups . The Trigger Time Frame can be anything lower 4H, 1h , 15 Min, 5 Min, 1 Min. The most important thing is that you need a Setup AND a Trigger before you can enter. SETUP + TRIGGER = TRADE ENTRY .. SETUP with no TRIGGER = NO TRADE For example a IF YOUR SETUP ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THIS THREAD IS FOR A POSSIBLE SHORT. Then you look at the 15Min and it will make Higher Highs and Higher Lows.( While approaching the SETUP point.) As soon as the trend of the 15 Min change by taking out the previous Low. You will look to enter on the pullback which will most probably be the first Lower High. You might also want to see as confirmation a MOVING AVERAGE CROSSOVER like an 8 EMA crossing under a 34 EMA. on the Lower Time Frame There lots of ways to look for a Trigger but keep it simple and look for a trend change in the lower time frame. Trend change allways first in the lower time Frame and then rolls over to the Higher Time Frames. Just a caveat a low time frame like a 5 Min might stop you out more often because it can change trend in a whipsaw like manner. Hereunder is a summarry used by a wellknown trader about Triggers that she uses. She has a totally different way to define her SETUPS. REMEMBER THE SETUP IS A DEFINED PRICEZONE WHERE ONE EXPECT A CERTAIN PRICE ACTION. YOUR TRIGGER IS THAT IMPORTANT KEY THAT TELLS YOU WHETHER THAT SETUP( DEFINED PRICEZONE / or PRICE LEVEL (SUPPORT or RESISTANCE) is going to HOLD and evolve in a succesful trade Simple Triggers (to use on all charts other than the daily) daily) For a sell entry: Prior swing low is taken out AND there is a moving average crossover with the 8 bar ema crossing below the 34 ema. (If you take out a prior swing low but the moving averages have not crossed to the downside, wait for the crossover. If you have the moving average crossover but have not taken out a prior swing low wait for it to take out a prior swing low.) If you don't enter on the first firing of the trigger, you can buy the next pullback instead, anywhere from 50% - 786% back to the prior swing. For a buy entry: Prior swing high is taken out AND there is a moving average crossover with the 8 bar ema crossing above the 34 ema. (If you take out a prior swing high but the moving averages have not crossed to the upside, wait for the crossover. If you have the moving average crossover but have not taken out a prior swing high yet, wait for it to take out a prior swing high.) If you don't enter on the first firing of the trigger, you can buy the next pullback instead, anywhere from 50% - 786% back to the prior swing. ***It is more ideal IF the crossover is by a decent margin rather than a "peek" above.***

--- 帖子 #468 ---
banco, Thank you most kindly. I am most obliged. I will leave out the other bit about "...summarry used by a wellknown trader about Triggers that she uses. She has a totally different way to define her SETUPS..." for now, just gonna confuse me more.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Danjuma Pleasure. Agree it is much easier if you see it on the charts. Will look if I can post an example. Best will be if we use one of Pinbar`s SETUP LEVELS on the Daily which work out to be a nice trade. I have just do it on one of the previous pages and played around with the trigger time frames. Sometimes a 30 Min gives better swings( Higher Highs and Higher Lows) Than the 15 Min or 1 H. Use the Trigger Time Frame with the more smooth rythmic swings. It change from Forex Pair to Forex Pair and even the same pair like the EUR/USD RYTHM will change. The Crux of trading is SETUP + TRIGGER = TRADE ENTRY SETUP with no TRIGGER = NO TRADE Trigger is allways on a Lower Time Frame. KEEP IT SIMPLE especialy on the Trigger Chart Template you only plot a 8EMA and 34 EMA . NOTHING ELSE. Then you will easily follow the swings. HH and HL forms an uptrend and LH and LL forms an downtrend. You might want to put a horizontal line on the Trigger Time Frame at the LEVEL( SETUP ZONE ) as defined on the DAILY. Then you can monitor that level on the trigger time frame and see how the price action reacts as it approaches that level. If it simply goes through it with Higher Highs and Higher Lows as previously for instance, then there is no trend change therefore no Trigger and No Trade and no harm done to your account.

banco, "..Will look if I can post an example. Best will be if we use one of Pinbar`s SETUP LEVELS on the Daily which work out to be a nice trade..." I am most certainly looking forward to this. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Banco laid it out well for you. I think you have basically got it. However, Jarroo will touch trade these levels without a trigger, if there is a lot of confluence involved. Also, he is using the ATR sl as in the original sfp. Sometimes he will even use a small buffer, so that even if price did not quite hit his level, he will take the trade. I am not so keen on the buffers as, how can we really be sure price has tested the level, if it never reaches it. As for the mention of the EMA crossover, this is not part of Jarroo's methodology. Maybe Banco added it as a filter from some other system but, I have certainly never seen Jarroo using them. For example, the #SQ3 setup, I had waited for, missed hitting the LLS by 1.75 pips, I did not take it as, price is already to far away from the entry and too close to the FTA to make it viable. Still, it is hard to sit on my hands for days, and then see this occur. That said, it is the nature of the beast and, I would rather be out of a trade wishing I was in it than, in a trade wishing I was out of it.

Just flipping through charts to see if anything else is approaching an interesting level.

Many thanks for the replies PB. With reference to your last chart, please see my questions in red annotated on your original chart below: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Have you seen Jarroo's videos on the Daily close confirmation? If not he posted the link here. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...92#post6739092

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I understand why the DCC or WCC is confusing. And Jarroo himself also says to enter on the DCC or the pullback. He has never said as much to me but, I suspect that if the DCC or WCC is close to our level, it is ok to enter, if it is too far away, as in some of the examples I drew on the chart, it makes sense to enter on the pullback. If there is one. Hope this clears things up.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Here is another one, actually this one annoyed me as, I was waiting for price to reach the HHR in the swing point. It still may if it finds support around 129.151 area.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Thanks for the video link PB. I must confess though, I find Jarroo's video's not very clear with regards to the basics of his method.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks for the replies and charts, and please just to let you know I very much appreciate your time and patience. However, I am just getting slightly more confused. Outlined below once again is the way I understand it, trading daily charts for example. 1. Open a weekly chart, draw your HCR-LCS at recent consolidation box (this I am still not sure where the low or high will be as pointed out in your last chart I annotated) or the close of a recent swing point. 2. Go down to daily chart and do same as above. Then wait for a set-up on the daily chart - PBT&amp;CA or CB. 3. Say there was a PBT&amp;CB the DLCS, wait for a DCC of the PBT&amp;CB (a daily bar that touches the DLCS but closes below it). 4. Once you have got the DCC, drop down to say the H1 chart and look for a J16 type PA candle for your trigger to enter. The more confluences - (B)RN, Fibs, 365/150 EMAs with the PA candle, the better. 5. Once entered a trade, set your SL as determined earlier from the daily chart, which in this case will be below the low (plus some pips as buffer) of the daily PBT&amp;CB candle. Also mark you FTA. 6. Then drop down again to the H1 and look for signatures to manage your trade. As long as hourly candles do not close above the DLCS, stay in trade. Correct?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Ok, just do this. Open a weekly chart of EU and put these levels on it. Then, watch what price does if it gets to these levels, on the lower tf. Post your chart and state what you see happen. I and maybe Ghous, Donkey and JJ will go through it with you and explain what we see. It is better to do this in real time as, time permits. THIS IS NOT A TRADE RECOMMENDATION SO, ONLY DEMO ANYTHING YOU MAY OR MAY NOT SEE. Just demo anything interesting you see, and post charts remembering, that the things you may or may not do wrong are more important than the things you do right.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Tehuringa in the J16 thread just posted a reply to a post I made about a very insignificant H4 PB, in a bad location. I love his comment about the shaken coke feeling. We have all no doubt been there. Quoting Pinbar {quote} Wouldn't even notice it. In the middle of things!, price is going sideways, traffic and no tail on the pin which means, they have not drawn in enough people to push it up. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Tehuringa's comment ====================================================================================================== This.....it wouldn't register for me either. No space, tracking sideways, nowhere near perfect pinbar. You can draw lot's of lines/fibs on a chart and try and justify a trade, adding credence to something that you no is not an "A" trade and subsequently jump in and get get cleaned out. Stick to the basics, trade only A-grade setups....just concentrate on pin-bars at first on demo, adding in layers of more PA setups as you gain confidence and you will find that these high probability trades work. Write a trading business plan that lays out what patterns you will trade, what the perfect PA pattern works like, on what time frame, what % you will risk, etc and put it on the wall above your monitor. Mike's advice above is spot on.....don't feel the need to "Be" in the market.....let the market come to you on your terms and when it ticks all the boxes on your trading plan, place your pending trade and let it run its course. If markets are crabbing sideways or boxing, sure you can drop timeframes, scalp and end up feeling like a shaken up can of coca cola after getting whipsawed around....if FX ain't playing the game look at other markets until FX decides to give you the setups that you require.

Hmmm, something I do not understand about this #SQ3 chart After the weekly close, there are only 4 H4 candles on #SQ3 EUR/NZD had 11? Is it because the stock market is not open 24 hours a day?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
OK. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I would also mark this weekly bar high as, it has confluence with the 150 EMA &amp; the 1.32500 area. Price may well find support there for a push up.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Looks like #SQ3 is coming back for another test. I was thinking that Daily BUEOB was the trigger but, obviously not and, a lot of people in that trade are now reversing their positions, taking a loss and pushing price back down.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Is this a good place to sell despite the 1.700 BRN? I am going short near HHR level.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hey bro, I wouldn't be too confident on that one. Yes we have a fake out off of an HHR but its heading into a lot of traffic for me. Additionally notice that price is still hovering beneath the 1.700 BRN. A successful option protection attempt should have hurled price right back down on the very first couple of attempts to test the area just below 1.7. But this continued consolidation isn't very encouraging for a short scenario in my opinion. By the looks of it price is gearing for an actual test of 1.7. What it does after that cannot be concluded straight away. Now GBP is losing strength across the board which may go in favor of your scenario but I wouldn't use that fact to validate an otherwise mediocre setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Can we now please test my blue region? I love that region. Please pleeeze Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Let's help it a bit. Then it may even test the weekly HCR.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
You can lose the WLCS you have on your chart. No idea where you got that from but, it is not the WLCS. All you need to concentrate on right now, is the upper two levels.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Ok, I hear you. I was looking at that area as a consolidation box and marked the close of the top of the box as WHCR and of the bottom as WLCS. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #492 ---
The top of the box is fine as it is the hcr in the consolidation but, you are just using the lows in the lower line.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Ok, not too sure I understand this consolidation box HCR-LCS clearly. I think I will stick to just the swing points for now.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Ghous! May I ask after which bar did you enter? I see that that pinbar on the first day hit the HHS... Did you enter on the second day from a ret? Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hey Stephen, I entered on the highlighted bar. If you remember, I actually took a short trade on the first time we had a fake out off this HHR which turned out to be a BE trade. Since then price has only successfully held at the HHR level. There was something really special about the bar that I took this present trade off of, which actually worked as the trigger for me. Let's see if you can figure it out Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I will have a crack at it. The IB was a signal and the Hybrid PB-BEOB was a nice confirmation.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Good points. But there is more to it. g.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
The plot thickens. Because it actually touched the 1.9500?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Thanks Ghous.

Thanks for pumping in those extra lots Steve, Your help is much appreciated Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
No extra lots, just the extra 10 ton weight.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
There is only one kind of "weight" in the markets. And it isn't measured in "tonnes" g.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Bingo! It was the first and the only bar within that period of resistance that actually touched the RN. Not surprisingly it punched a bigger muscle than either of the preceding bars. I remember mentioning it in the J16 thread that I have always looked at Round numbers as the "engine" of the markets. Almost all the bigger games (and even smaller ones) revolve around either pushing and pulling price to them or simply away from them. Round numbers are one of those few tools that technical and fundamental traders use just as readily and popularly. g.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I thought it was too obvious an answer to mention at first. All this sitting on my hands is giving me the munchies for real Indian Rasmalai. How, I used to love it after a good meal. You ever eaten it Ghous, or something similar?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
The more obvious it is the better bro. I know people generally like some kind of "mind boggling trading secrets revealed" but the true secret lies not in the strategy (which may be extremely basic and straight forward) but the consistent execution of it. Oh yeah I have eaten Rasmalai! Its one of the favorite sweet dishes in this part of the world. Anything "Indian" that you eat most probably I have tasted it as we Pakistanis essentially represent the same culture at least with the cuisines. PS what better time to discuss Rasmalai when I am 14 hours into my fast and another hour and a half still to go before I break it? lol g.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I hear you on the RNs. Yeah, I prefer Rasmalai to the really sickly sweet Indian sweets like Gulab Jamun You lucky chap having such wonderful cuisine. Actually, there is a large Islamic community here in Harbin China, I tend to hang out at their kebab places at the weekends, eating lamb kebabs and spicy nan. But, real Indian curry, I have to make it myself.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I am not going to trade this but, I am going to watch how it reacts at this level, for future reference. The swing is not large enough for my liking.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hey guys, thanks for sharing those nice ideas and for the beautiful thread itself! I was curious what you think about the EURSGD daily SFP setup. The swing high no. 1 is the one that disturbs me. Does the fact that swing high no.2 was hit and that price closed below the W HCR (lines up with HHR level) should give it enough strenght in your opinion? I am sure the best thing would be to hit also the no.1 and close below both of them... Thanks guys, Oskar

--- 帖子 #509 ---
ghous thanks for all your contributions though. just watching to see how it plays out

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hey Oscarossa Welcome to the thread. I am not Ghous and am new to the Daily SFP so, let's let Ghous answer your question. Just a quick look at it and, I tend to agree with you that, I do not like the fact that the 1.7000 area was not hit, also looking at the monthly tf, we seem to have a very well defined support and resistance zone. Price reached just sort of smack in the middle of it. I am also interested to hear what Ghous will say about this one.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Well, you have the Daily Close Confirmation. Edit: However, I do not like the look of the possible continuation BUEOB.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hey Oscar, You are certainly thinking in the right direction. I would also prefer to see a test of the 1.7 at least and your swing point 1 as well. So this is still very much on the watch list. g.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I find it cheeky that on Fxpro I have CHF/SGD instead of SGD/CHF and they don't seem to be inverted mirror images of each other In fact I don't even have a fake out on CHF/SGD. g.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Thank you Pinbar &amp; Ghous for your replies, let's wait and see how it plays out... One more SGD here. It was spotted late but as a setup it was still not invalidated and moreover a nice PB (crosses also the WLCS) should indicate some upside strenght. What holds me back is the weak close of it and the bar next to it, both below DLCS. Thanks. Oskar

--- 帖子 #515 ---
This one has more to it, than meet the eye. Its actually bang off a major weekly LLS. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Still where the lower time frames make me nervous, is that they contain much less data and even knee jerks can be snapped and pictured into "great looking setups". One major reason I love the dailies is their inherent ability to see out the whole day's action to see what's really going on and whether it is sustainable. And because a lot of major setups don't hurry off into action I have been able to grab hold of enough setups to stay alive...really alive. I can recall countless bad trades because an average story on the higher TFs jumped out to me because I was on the 1H or the 4H and I couldn't resist. They would just fail on me and when I would scan my daily chart, the very same pair's daily chart would SHOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and I would learn that I got caught up yet again with the "noise". This one's obviously very different because it has the jewellery hanging off it, but I am still sticking to my dailies. I'll be waiting to see how the daily closes. g.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Thanks for showing the bigger picture here, it definitely could change or confirm what is going on here. But let me ask, if you are looking at it on the weekly, we should wait for the week to close, right? Oskar

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Apologies for not showing you the daily chart, but we actually have a daily swing low for daily close reference which stems out from the weekly story. As a stand alone daily LLS trade this would have been pretty pathetic looking at the strong down trend and the minor swing low, but the weekly LLS lining up just adds to the daily setup as confluence. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I was aware of the daily setup, but yes as you pointed out, it is such a minor swing and strong downtrend over there, so that was why I asked about the weekly close. If we want it to support the story, we should wait for its (weekly) close, is that correct thinking? Thank you. Oskar

--- 帖子 #519 ---
yes, an even more conservative view point would require a weekly close above the weekly LLS. g.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
thanks ghous. i guess the weekly story does not support this one fully yet. so a better test of the RN 7200 would be better. what do you think?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Agreed. There are certainly more important regions down below than the one its currently at. g.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I have been busy lately and therefore I have been posting less. But still I put in my orders when I see a good level and setup developing. Just like this beauty on the USDCAD. I had my order sitting on this level for 2 weeks and it got triggered last night without me even noticing it until I saw the profit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Looking at #BA, it appears that the Monthly HCR is failing to act as resistance and, I suspect it will act as support, if we get a push off the HHR and run back into it.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Ghous I am tempted by this area but, I can hear a voice in my head that says, "Wait for the 1.7000 to get tested"! Do you think I am possibly complicating this too much by this way of thinking or, am I on track.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
A good rule of thumb I like to go by is: if the trade setup doesnt jump at you after watching a chart for maxium of 5 seconds, it's not a good trade. You wont need to ask yourself questions or argue with any voices in your head The best trades, you will know when you see them. The rest, don't bother to take them.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Yeah, I am leaning towards that view.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hi Helius! Can you give us some more background information on your touch trades? Do you simply trade PPZs with touches? (I don't think that would be THAT easy/simple. I mean til now I don't see a complete system behind your trades, as I see at SFP trading. As I have read your posts I saw that you tend to fancy the idea of price shooting up, leaving some orders behind, however I would be honoured if you could devote us some of your precious time and explain your system more precisely. (I know about your video thread, but there as far as I remember you didn't go into discussing your system. Thanks, Have a nice weekend Stephen

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi Pinbar, I had the same question (Post# 508). Ghous already answered that here . Hope that helps... Oskar

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Thanks, I must have missed that post.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hey Steve, Helius made a good point there. I do the same thing as well. It takes me no more than 10 minutes to scan 60 daily charts at the end of each day. This removes all the clutter and everything in between the extremes of a great setup and a poor setup just get hurled down the end of the poor setup so all that remains for consideration is the set of good trades. I just haven't been able to embrace this setup at all. Price seems to be less and less scared of the 1.7000 region and even a test of it, I don't think, will get me too excited. Again a lot depends on how things actually unfold but just the gut feeling here isn't very conducive or geared towards looking for a sure trade here. g.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Thanks Ghous, sounds like good advice. I shall also do the scan and leave only the best charts open where there is a possibility in the near future that price will trigger a setup. No point putting charts on the screen when price is thousands of pips away from an area. Looks like #BA and #SQ3 are arriving at the their respective zones.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
My second trade this week. I closed it manually before market closed friday night. @lametrader: my trades, just like this one as well, are based on the concept that "support turns into resistance; and vice versa." So i just look for levels where price respected it very well and then I wait for a break and the pullback into the level. That's basically it in a nutshell Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just demoing this as, this is way too exotic for my liking. Just trying to see if the mechanism is the same. I am wondering if this could be a weekly IPB that failed to break the 1325.00 rn?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
This is weird, probably something I do not understand about buy limits as, I do not usually use them. The order was placed yesterday at 1236.50, price made it as low as 1324.50 yet, the order did not get triggered. Hard to catch this market open time, I guess that is the advantage of forex being open 24x5

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi Pinbar, your order will be triggered when ASK price gets there. Most likely it wasn't the case due to large spread in the early stage after opening when price made its low. Oskar

Pinbar / Ghous, This is a great thread, fantastic work and your efforts are greatly appreciated. The LCS/HCR or LLS / HHR was very informative and i felt the scales falling and the light bulb go off. I have been looking for something that would fit around my work and looking at weekly charts for these levels is probably it. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Thanks O Hadn't considered that. I am in at last.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Welcome Chelski Yeah, interesting isn't it. The HCR gives a clear target for the HHR. And, the HHR gives us a clear target for the PBT&amp;CA.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hey guys, good to watch this one (Alcatel-Lucent), I guess... Oskar

--- 帖子 #541 ---
another one... Oskar

--- 帖子 #542 ---
This could be interesting.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Just remembered that, I was supposed to wait for the daily close. Probably, a psychological sabotage plan by my mind because of waiting for the entry. Another reason to scan the charts Daily.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Looking like it may work out.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi guys! Just having a quick question on the following EURJPY chart. What I saw: -We had a strong trend (black line) and it was broken. Fantastic. -We had then this minor PPZ (green line which was an ex-HCR. -We had this nice 130 MAJOR BRN. Broken as well. -We got this mini Pinnish inside bar. As I have looked through some IBs the last month this shape is the best for sort. (Yeah however the size is of the former bearish bar is not that great but whatever.... -My FTA would have been the pink zone. Bar lows etc. Price broke and then in 2 days i got out in a lost. (My SL was just above that minor swing low, so it was not taken on the next day.) Or it was simply a "shit happens" trade?... Thanks

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hi, first of all, you need to understand the environment you are placing the trade in. Price doesn't trend as you wrote, actually it is the opposite, we are stuck in a choppy consolidated environment (see the big pink box) full of trouble areas and no space for price to run into. Now, your entry is initiated by a weak break of the so-so trendline. In such kind of a setup there is really very few things on our side, so the risk management should be trated accordingly = tight. Notice the small white box and its PPZ that runs in the middle of it, this held as support (although price was able to close below, but it was very weak close). Then price made it almost to the FTA = middle of the bigger pink box - it was the right moment to reduce risk rapidly. Oskar

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Thanks! Yeah zooming out would have helped lol. After zooming out that IB seems ridiculously small I guess I should stop trading for 90 pips or less than Daily ATR on Daily TF... OR the setup has to be GOOD! Maybe If i had the opportunity to follow the trade on H1. I would have seen some interesting stuff We had a swing low, which was tested and then closed above as a pin (Yeah I know it didn't close in prior bar (First indication of weakness) - However It was not sticking out much. So I might say its okay. But then price tried to break out from this H1 consolidation box. And guess what - either some news came out, but we formed a BUOB. (Technically not a buob cause bullish bar doesn't engulfs it properly but still) - We all know the order flow behind. If we combine these 2 bars what do we get? A nice pin bar which is just sicking out as it should... Thats where I should have moved to BE... I dunno maybe im just seeing things cause its late here but price literally does what it has to do. I mean goes above daily close, does not find support, so it goes back to BRN, tests it - look at those pinbars - and then It breaks the D HCR again, finds support on the double EMAs... And then shoots back. +1 QUESTIOn I think my EMAs are switching accordingly to my TF. Although I have seen jarroo using multi TF EMAs. Which one should I use - I mean is my statement valid as I say price found support on 1H EMAs or noone give a sh*t about H1 EMAs cause ppl tend to look for higher TF EMAs... Thanks guys. Its almost noon here... Better off to bed Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hey Oscar, How do you manage to trade in that birdcage. My charts were like that years ago and, I had problems believing in any of the lines drawn on the chart. Nearly drove me crazy. I like to make mental notes of the PPZ on the daily TF as, we can actually see them quite clearly, around current price. Yeah, I may use the rectangle tool to mark them if I am in a trade and looking for an FTA or STA

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Looks like part of the bigger picture to me. Let's see what Ghous thinks about this possible scenario.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi Pinbar! How do you draw normal rectangles on your chart? (Where only the lines of the rectangle are visible? BTW you were right - after watching more jarroo videos jarroo DOES usually wait for 4H 1H PA confirmation and he might close out if a 1H (or a 4H) closes below. However as I see this trading style requires full attention - aka sitting in front of PC (to wait for 1H confirmation, to manage trade when the first High/Low was hit - maybe reenter etc... PS: Could you answer my question about the EMAs and Multi TF EMAs? Thanks. Have a nice day guys! Stephen

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I have never seen Jarroo using MTF EMAs. You can just draw them in Paint or, you can remove the "Draw as background" check in the rectangle properties and it will give you the outline.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi Pinbar, honestly, I try to simply avoid it. Oskar

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Agreed. Price is still pretty much caught up in the wedge and there isn't much fun trying to decipher what its doing while its in it. Of course things get interesting when price decides to break out or fake out. g.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thanks Ghous Just cut #SQ3 loose for a loss, after the close below the level. It was going against that massive Monthly BEOB albeit at a SL.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Ghous I am thinking our reasoning for passing on a trade are equally if not more important as the reasons to take a trade. The charts shows, why I am not considering this one. Your comments on my logic, both good and bad, are greatly welcome.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
It behaved as I thought it would. The daily has yet to close but, even if it closed below the SP, I will pass.

--- 帖子 #557 ---

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Honestly bro I am not too sure what triggered that trade for you. g.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Very true. Nicely spotted deficiencies on that one. Lack of space was a BIG deterring factor there. g.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Me Likes it! g.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi Ghous, Kerinsp, is that ok to enter before daily close? Or could it be it was an H4 entry? Thanks. Oskar

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Im not an expert at this but I took a chance on getting long on a h1 swing fail of the level hoping to get a D1 close above the line. I may have jumped the gun a bit. I think its a decent swing point though.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
didn't work, will look at it tomorrow now

--- 帖子 #564 ---
It's okay. Tom (The Wizard) enters as soon as the 1H fails to close below. And as I remember he says as well "if we broke - even with one pip" - he is in. (Of course assuming that we got space etc.) However he would have quit right when the 1H closed below this level. I dunno. Maybe a Break even after seeing that shitty bearish pin (just right before it broke down and close below.) Sh*t happens... Was a nice setup though considering the fact that price kind of accelerated into the area thus creating some space. Stephen

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Yes, indeed. I am just thinking about it and am thinking it was sitting on my hands for 10 days watching the 1326.50 area so much that, I saw it trigger. Even though it did not in fact trigger, it just broke the low.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I must be missing something here as, it closed below the level? Still, it has more space going for it, than the #SQ3 setup I jumped the gun on.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Stephen, that's interesting. So let's say I go for a more conservative approach and rather wait for a daily close. Before entering I will chceck also the H1 closes and when I find a close below, it means the setup is already invalidated even if the daily close is ok. Is that correct? Oskar

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I would not mix the Daily SFP with an hourly signature. The two are completely different in my opinion. The Hourly or 4 hour close above or below is more to do with the HCR LCS of a Monthly or Weekly level. Yes, you can use the Daily levels but, the Higher the TF the more strength they have IMHO. EDIT: If you are trading an Hourly SFP, you would be better off using the Hourly close below to cut the trade, if you are trading a daily SFP, I would use the Daily close below as the exit.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi! As far as I remember - YES! In the video I watched to said he always looks at these setups at the 1H. So as soon as the HH/LL is broken but failed to close (and we have decent space) - he enters. Note that Tom says in his thread: "I like to see when price accelerated into these areas" -&gt; Newbs would think its indicating strength , however for pros it's indicating something else: SPACE. wohoo I reached 200th post Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Pinbar, Yes, checking the lower TF reminds me more of Jarroos HCR-LCS signatures, but it could be that Tom uses them as well in SFP setups. Sometimes it is hard to determine what TF fits the SFP setup and that could be confusing when we wait for confirmation. Like it was here . (For me a clear weekly setup, while Ghous is OK to wait for daily close). Also I was a bit confused when I saw people are juming in trades before the bar closes on particular TF. I know the higher TF is considered stronger, but with this logic we could wait for close on weekly, then on monthly, then yearly, etc... This is obviously not the case how we should approach the things here, I guess... Oskar

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Yeah, that was me, jumping in before the bar closed. Due frustration from sitting on my hands and watching the #SQ3 chart too much. Just goes to show that, as they say, we should "Trade what we see &amp; not what we think".

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Interesting SP on EG. However, the lack of space would concern me. The Hourly, showed a nice IB. But, I am still sitting on my hands for a good Daily setup.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
This is on my watch list

--- 帖子 #574 ---
stopped out on that cadchf and then it rallies today. crap. Next up eurusd screaming to a level of interest.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
On the face of it, it appears to be the same error I made on #SQ3, entering before the close.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
nah, I'm happy with the entry, my mistake was not cutting the trade once my plan did not play out, h1 sfp to d1 sfp.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
No it is not. Not for me at least. I never take a trade without the daily close confirmation. The only exception to it (which isn't really an exception from if you look at it practically) is taking a trade maybe half an hour before the daily close when Price is behaving typically in the Asian session. g.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
yes it did Steve, Kerin just showed a chart without any mentions of any trades that he took hence I thought he was just pointing to a "potential" setup to which I quite willingly nodded to. This was always going to be a pass for me when price closed under the LLS. g,

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Been there and done that tonnes of times. Me being a daily-o-holic comes with a reason. g.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I'll get to this later tomorrow, as I am busy with Eid preparations, but just some quick food for thought: For those of you eager to carry this method on to the lower time frames without sacrificing much of the reliability, there is quite some merit to actually taking a more "ripe" fake out as opposed to a more "raw" one on the lower time frames. The key to the daily setups being more reliable is quite simply dependent on the fact that they contain more information, are spread over more time and are more tuned in on the bigger story hence staying afloat amongst all the intra day noise. Keeping this in mind, and the anatomy and structure of the order flow behind these fake outs there is quite some scope for this method to be expanded into the lower time frames "By waiting for multiple lower time frame bar confirmations indicating the same structural features of a fake out" . Trying applying this concept to the 4H CAD/CHF swing low buy setup that we are talking about. I'll get back later . . . g.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
This is a setup that I am looking at (subject to the bar closing well) Some solid confluence! 8300 RN (very responsive!) + PPZ + trend line + hints of a bearish flag in the making + 150 EMA. I see that space is an issue but you gotta love the location. Plus there is actually some space cleared up by the smooth move down and back up by the recent action, which also hints to a possible cleanup of the area of messy order flow - still a hint but coupled with strong confluence I am considering this one for sure. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Is this a swing failure pattern?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
It is but, the SFP bar closed as a PB making the entry too far from the SFP for my liking. Also, I am not sure about how reliable the SFP is going to be when you start aggregating the time frame like that.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Thanks for explaining the original thought on that SP. I am trying to work out what actually happened at this level on H4 and am floundering a little. Possibly bar 4 testing the low and then filling the space created by the close below and the level has something to do with the mechanics of the bars?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Not the first time it has happened, but these always hurt. Price missed my order by 2 pips. Ouch. lol g.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Synthesizing trade setups on hybrid time frames isn't what I personally prefer, but to answer your question, yes that is a swing failure pattern. g.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hey Steve, I don't think you're floundering at all. You seem to have grasped the idea quite well but those acronyms sure make it sound like you're talking of some rocket science there. Lets get right back to the basic idea of a "swing failure": Price swiftly hitting a major HHR or an LLS and testing the region beyond it without successfully sustaining the momentum and falling right back within the swing point. The daily bar close is a condition that helps systematize the concept as well as filter the not so obvious setups but be very clear that while a daily closing back within the HHR/LLS is a strong sign of a fake out, its not what makes or breaks a fake out setup....or rather to avoid the confusion I should say the close doesn't make or break the fake out "scenario". I say this because while for the most part the best fake out setups are the ones, where you have the daily closing in your favor, scan your charts and you'll find tonnes of examples where price closes strongly beyond the swing point and immediately and some times even eventually closes right back within the swing point. The most defining characteristic of a fake out is quite simply the falsification of the basic structural principle of support turning into resistance and vice versa Going by this, whenever you see price stepping on the gas beyond an HHR (resistance) and find it not being able to hold up via support at the HHR upon a pull back. You have a fake out. Beyond this every condition I use is honestly for systematization and filtration purposes. *****************---------------------------***************** Now that we have the back drop set, let's get down what I was talking about the other day: As I mentioned I like the dailies because they contain more information and a bigger chunk of time encompassing all the trading sessions. With a 4H fake out or a 1H fake out, you are banking on partial or incomplete information which doesn't invalidate those time frames for trading but does extract some reliability juice from the method. Attempts can still be made though, by taking a more conservative stance on the lower time frames than on the higher time frames, to still execute the method confidently. Being conservative obviously means waiting for the best swing points (possibly ones that stand out even on the higher time frames) but additionally in this scenario it means, waiting for multiple confirmations after the fake out actually occurs . Not only are you then dealing with more information, you also have seen through a larger "time bracket" to be more confident about your decision. Examples to follow which should clear things up further. PS: this is still an idea which is very much in a test tube, so kindly don't start running through several intra day clicks of "fake out scenarios". Do some serious back and forward testing and possibly post the results or questions or points of discussion here so it benefits you and all. Stay safe please. g.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Rocket Science. I feel like a :nerd:LOL I am going to read and re-read this all day, till I get it. First thought is, if the close below is a filter, then not using it seems a little tricky. This is because, I am yet to really comprehend the tell tale signs and mechanism of which H4 bar should be filling the level in after a daily close below. Just hit me on the head with a rock, if I am going off the right track here. Appreciate the thought provoking ideas.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
If you think about these setups for a moment each one of them constitutes quite some hours of action during the development phase and hence in many ways replicates the higher time frame actions only a bit more chopped up. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The entry trigger for me would have to be the bar that shows me the tip off in my favor, pin bars good bearish/bullish bars and pull backs and hold ups at the HHR/LLS levels. The trick would have to be nailing down the location and space issues, as well as picking out the major swing points. Notice also that its easy to get carried away with this stuff because some of the essential features of the daily setups such as single bar or at most double bar fake out setups that filter out a lot of scenarios are missing. Ideally you would like the fake out scenario to develop within a "few bars" rather than some true trading action beyond the swing point prior to a move back into the swing point. In the coming months I will be testing this idea out more for sure. g.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
yes it sure is a little tricky. But the guile slowly eradicates when you lift your head off individual bars and concentrate on the bigger story AT ALL TIMES. Just remember that in a court of law you don't put forward the reason for killing a guy as "pulling the trigger" but more along the lines of "he winked at my wife or sent a flying kiss and was unlucky to have me spot him him do that" The trigger is what killed the guy (trigger bars and their closes) of course but he actually died because his ill character met a possessive husband (the bigger story). silly analogy but should communicate the point. Its all about the story! g.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
It is a good analogy, I feel. Just a quick question about the wicks you mentioned in the EC and EU charts. You mentioned that in the EC chart, the wick to the upside was a plus for the bulls. However, in the EU setup you mentioned that the wicks to the downside seem to suggest weakness. I mean, the EC wick is a little longer in length but doesn't appear to be that drastically different. So if the wick to the upside is a bonus how come the wick to the downside is a negative?

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Here is one which I think I may have worked out.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Sorry for the confusion. I meant weakness for bears. Price had closed below the LLS albeit weakly and the other bars followed suit. Ofcourse the weakness refers to bearish weakness under the LLS which meams strength for the bulls and hence the bullish setup. G.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Thanks Ghous Think I get what you mean.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi Pinbar and Ghous, Could you tell me why it's not good to look at 2 day charts? Is it because not enough traders are watching it?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Yes, I believe that is the main reason.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
yes. Plus also the fact that once you start manufacturing time frames it is hard to stop. I mean why would you look at only a 2day chart? If the purpose is to simply move from more chopped up action into a more condensed form why not a 1 day 8 hour chart or a 3day 12 hour chart? Traders are neither watching the 2day chart nor are they watching a 1 day 8 hour chart . . . Combining different time frames condenses price action and although it doesn't distort it, it can seriously impact the shape of the candlesticks/bars which happen to be our (and other traders') sources for triggers. Its better to take a pin bar on say the hourly than a 3 hour chart. hope this helps. g.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Thanks. What you said is also available for new time frames offered my Metatrader5? They offer a lot of intraday charts compared to Metatrader4.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Let's see how EU closes today.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Yeah, they offer them so as to confuse more potential losers.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Another bad thing I noticed about 2 day charts is some of the bars are actually 1 day. The bar from Friday sometimes is blended with an inexistent Saturday bar, and an inexistent Sunday bar is blended with the Monday bar. I won't be using them any more. Not so sure about MT5, if enough traders will start to use MT5 instead of MT4 I think they can become good time frames to trade even if now they aren't.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I left for vacation on Tuesday but put in a few orders before Monday night. I just checked and USDJPY was triggered. It missed the TP by 2 pips. I just took 80% profit and will leave the rest running with a tight stop. I will always trust these level-trades. They will work in &gt;75% of the time and as you can see the drawdowns are so small that the risk-reward-ration will make you pretty happy Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I take it you like levels that have instances of support and resistance off of them further back in time as opposed to the newly formed swing points? g.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I found that immediate retests (1-2 hours) after a break of a level is more risky, yes. But I put more emphasiz on whether a level has been both support and resistance before.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
GU could be worth the wait. I am anticipating the 150 EMA arriving as confluence at the 61.8 fibo or just below it for the extra power of the FTB.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I was just reading Phanti's e-books and I was wondering if im right. Question on chart.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
First of all its highly unlikely that your Mr. Big lots would be waiting there with a single pending order worth hundreds of lots. You can expect him to have multiple orders around a tight cluster of price levels. With that kind of selling pressure heading into the swing low, the only real action from the pros would have had to be stop hunting and fading into all that selling around the marked swing low. If selling is what they really wanted, it makes sense for them to allow for the existing selling pressure to die a natural death by hitting some obvious/expected buy orders at support. The equilibrium that then follows is an ideal situation for the bigger sell orders to come in as sellers start losing steam and start booking partial/full profits as well as some bullish action countering the weaker bears. hope this helps. g.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi g! Hmmm. So Mr BigGuy has 700 lots, he wants to sell. He divided it into 20 * 35LOT pieces. We have a huge selling pressure. We blast through the low. Mr BigGuy (and his friends) are sad, because he only could sell 100Lots. So what he does, is he pushes price up a bit. He assumes that MrLittleGuy and his friends are now clapping in their joy seeing price breaking through so hard, and they are yelling "go south baby, go!" (aka. MrLittleGuy is in short.) Now MrBigGuy needs liquidity to get rid of his other 600 Lots. So he pushes price up, until the Stops of MrLittleGuy and his friends are taken out. The StopLoss level of a Sell order means a buy order - which is liquidity if MrBigGuy wants to short. So MrBigGuy simply hits the sell button now and loads the rest of his portfolio onto the market. Does the same happen on daily chart? I mean when Helius says price bounced back and forth so fast from the PPZ that there were orders left? Cuase there it seems a bit odd that MRBigGuy and his friends are waiting months just to get rid of those LOTs... However if I assume that companies (like Nissan, Daimler etc) want to sell at good price - I mean they need 2 billion eur - they will obviously wait til price gets to a good level. Can this be a reason as well? Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Somehow I came across this stuff. Guy says big companies don't give a damn about charts and current price of the currencies. They need the money , they buy it. http://www.fxstreet.com/webinars/ses...a-9f08f701e826

--- 帖子 #610 ---
it's a great video and I have watched it a few times myself. But this is not the message. Plus, the "big companies" wouldn't be big if they wouldn't care about the current price. Buying when price is low and selling when price is high. Like in any other business, that's how money is made. And Sam Seiden also shows where institutional buying and selling occurs. That's his "style of trading". A method I also follow. Sam Seiden said that it's very unlikely that JP Morgan or DeutscheBank fx traders would meet at 7 a.m. and discuss whether there is a H&amp;S, a double top or a double bottom forming anywehre

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I was rather thinking about like a chinese giant company (just as Sam said). Profit is a great thing - and If i were the manager of the company I would make sure that we buy the given currency at a good price. I mean I would say - okay guys we got 150million EUR left. lets wait for til the cross is good and then buy. In the worst case we gotta buy at the current market price... But if they get lucky they can avoid a lot of unnecessary loss. (That would be the way I would think.) And these companies are big - I mean I could imagine that they are the one whose orders are left behind unfulfilled and then they wait til price gets back (first touch) and then baam! Anyway Im just looking for an explanation why things are the way they are Cheers, Stephen

Always helps to clear out the mess and wait for the most obvious picture to surface on the higher TFs. I can smell some ripeness over that one g.

You mean ripeness as in delectable or overripe as on rotten?

Sitting on my hands and using the time to look at the setups that do not look like they will play out. Here is my take on this one and would appreciate Ghous'es opinion on it.

Hey pinbar! Whats the difference between your "day" and "night" themes? Do you use the night-theme for stocks, and the day-theme for currencies? Cheers, Stephen

--- 帖子 #620 ---
No, just when I get blind from the white background. I wouldn't start messing with stocks till you get your system together have &amp; proven it to yourself. They do not move to quite the same rules that FX does.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
No I meant just perfectly ripe. g.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hey Steve, Agree with all you said, Also don't forget that no FX currency pair or individual stock/index chart is isolated and independent of the rest of the market. And whats going on overall will always have an impact on the chart you are watching. The USD is due for some major news today in a few hours and while we are not news traders just a quick view of the FF calender can give you insights on why price maybe dying down or behaving erratically specially when the abnormal behavior tends to permeate across the board in general. As I type, on a non-bank-holiday day with news here and there, we are sitting in the most active trading session of the day yet it feels like you're watching the dead Asian sessions. All I am pointing to, is that price dying out, could also be the result of the market plunging into the waiting mode. g.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
lol I gotta solute you for staring at those white charts bro. I liked them for a while till my eyes started stinging and the move back to black made life easier. And the "while" actually comprised of 15 minutes. So yeah...hats off big time g.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Hello Guys, At first: this thread is an excellent work! One could never find a better public place for the deep investigation of the trading methods of Mr. Jarro and Tom "The Wizard" Dante. Today I am planning to make a trade on XAGUSD, if the daily bar closes above the critical level. There is definitely place for the trade however it is definitely not too much. I am planning approximately 1:1 winning ratio. If the price retests my buy limit, the probability of reaching my TP will be quite high but the question is: would you open this trade with a relatively low RR?

--- 帖子 #625 ---
What is your reason for buying? I would not buy it at that area for the reasons on the weekly and monthly chart. Looks like a RT of the weekly LCS and also it is going right into that monthly spike just hanging in space.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Oh, I was hoping you would set me straight. LOL Thanks for the news reminder, I tend to ignore it completely. I will check how close news is just before placing a trade though. Totally agree on the white charts, my eyes have been paying the toll recently. Probably switch to black for both day and night. Just demoing the #BA out of boredom more than anything else. The weekly IB break was the trigger, as it is in the same direction we expect it to go.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
If price closes above the weekly LCS this evening I would place a buy limit on the weekly LCS, and the SL will be under the daily trigger bar and TP is the low the monthly spike you mentioned. This SL and TP are also around 50 pips. I know this is surely not a very clear trade. This is why I ask it on this thread. Is this more understandable now?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Like this:

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Yeah, it is not very clear. I can see that you are trying to get in on the break of the TL but, we are in a very strong downtrend. There is no space and price is IMHO going to get trapped in this zone area between the former LCS &amp; the newer one. It is an easy pass for me. Yeah, the RT could activate your buy order then hit your SL. There is just not enough space for me to justify paying the spread and risking my equity, when I do not have to on such a poor setup. It may breakout, and that is ok too, it just does not interest me.

Am I just newbish or there is not much jarroo trade in it? I mean if we trade on the weekly, then we have to wait for a weekly CA, and then we cpuld enter with a daily retrace+confirmation. If we are trading daily, then a)jarroo would look for a lower TF confirmation and set his TP to the breakthroughcandle's high. (Take partial profit there , BE there or sg.) b) we play with a daily close confirmation which means we wait +1 day and we watch if the next candle closes above as well. (Please correct me, but as far as I know from the videos this is how jarroo trades!) As I can recall jarroo doesn't touch-trade much - and in your case we would talk about a touch trade. Jarroo only touch-trades, when the SPACE is great + the confluence (support in this case) is strong too. (A nice PPZ with Weekly+Daily levels + an EMA would be considered as a strong support that could be touch-traded imo.) But as I can see here this trade has none if it. Back in Mai when I discovered jarroos technique i played around with it a lot (due to university stuff I ALWAYS entered on touch, however i couldnt manage my position, when the high was reached...) - Now Im experimenting with daily close confirmation and the result is the same -&gt; We want to have some kind of confirmation... Cheers, Stephen

Thanks Pinbar I understand your concept An other one: A triangle is forming on USDJPY, and it seems to be quite clear if the price breaks the line of downtrend, and the monthly HCR-s we can get huge space for a long position

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Breaking through the 10 BRN we could trade into some good space. Do you agree guys?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Sorry, I do not like the look of either of them. USD/JPY is going to be trading into the VBRN and a ppz. As for USD/CAD, looks like this area has already flipped to resistance.

Sitting on my hands and trying to use the time to invalidate bad setups. This large bar that closed below caught my eye this morning but, after about 10 seconds of looking at it, it is a pass. Need to get the time to invalidate these down to 0.2 seconds.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Agree Steve, I was pretty close to pulling the trigger on this one but I too feel the cons over weigh the pros here. Space would be my biggest concerns with all those upper wicks coming in the way and just the general mess we are in. g.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
This is a trade I am. EUR/GBP long right off the proven PPZ. We have implicit divergence and confluence with a trend line. An ideal entry it seems was bang at the close of the fake out bar (would have gotten in a few pips earlier) but I wanted to see through the first few hours of the day for any hints of a wick filling activity (we are near a swing high anyways) but so far this has remained true to the bullish order flow that created the wick. No set final take profit on this one as yet. As is often the case I'd like to see how this unfolds before determining any real final targets on this one although 8700 is one I am looking at. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Pulled out for a half bar loss. 8600 seems to be resisting, and we know how the wick can then answer the question of the path of least resistance. I was anticipating a quick burst above 8600, and although this is far from over I am out now that I know I don't have what I had expected off this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

Hmmm. Mike said on the james16 thread that he doesn't find this setup appealing due to lack of space. Could you guys take some negatives on the traid? (Cause personally I would have entered too...) Thanks, Stephen

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I promise I will also show you my failed trades. However, most recently I could not find a level that did not work. Today, EUR/USD is presenting us with a nice support&amp;resistance flip. Almost at second target and almost time to call it a week with 2/2 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Pinbar! The ppz you have signed on your USDJPY is also on my chart with two purple line (two monthly HCR/LCS) and I mentioned that when the triangle is broken and this ppz is broken we can get space for a trade. Yeah I forgot to mention 100 vBRN but of course I would wait for breaking this 100 vBRN also. And why don't you like USDZAR?

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Ghous! On EURGBP may I ask why had you ignored the monthly HCR directly above the huge pinbar before you opened the trade?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Yeah, I also was racking my brain over EG also but, somehow did just not like those bar highs on the left in consolidation.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
You know, this really is not what Jarroo has been teaching. I also, do not like this wedge.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
That wouldn't pass Mike's filters even after a million tries. Simply because as a pin bar trade that was pretty mediocre. I took it more so as a fake out and was looking for a quick break above, but the 8600 held nicely hence the early exit. If price had shot above 8600 it was then pretty logical to expect it to keep climbing. g.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hoa! Some great work there Helius my friend. g.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hey Micro, I don't watch HCR/LCS levels to that extent. For me though, the 8600 was always going to be the real test (which price failed at) and here it lines up with your monthly HCR too. g.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
What really got me hooked here was the nice PPZ that the fake out bar was off of and the trend line confluence. As repeatedly mentioned above, a move above the 8600 in an affirmative manner is what I was looking for. g.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Yes, it was a really nice PPZ, that is also what caught my attention. Anyway, got to give a little back sometimes, I know you are still well ahead. I am interested in NZD/USD on this rally back.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
No doubt we are both glad we passed. The 1.4600 area looks interesting. I actually am starting to think looking only at the daily setups, allows me time to work out the good setups from the bad. That said, I have yet to find a good one.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Depending on the close, USD/CHF looks like it could be interesting. Hope we don't get a bearish PB. Never thought, I would see the day, I would say that.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Waiting for your cherries is hands down the toughest job when it comes to trading the higher time frames. Its very unnatural to not be antsy in the dry periods in between. But I believe its also the most critical skill that you must master if you eventually want to stand out in the long term. I haven't totally mastered it myself yet either, but every day I get closer to my targets and that is all that matters. g.

Thanks pinbar I understand what you mean.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Yes, I am finding this is the case but, the TF is also teaching me something important about being objectively analytical. Rather than, jumping in guns blazing before looking at the setup in an objective manner. Here are another two on my watch list. Totally agree that, scanning the charts daily and just picking ones that may soon come into play, is the way to go.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I am just going to watch Gold as, there is very little space to the FTA with that consolidation just below the minor SP. Still, we can still learn from it and that is truly worth more than this commodity.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Long EUR/USD but with a very small position! Why? Because the way we traded back into the level is not what I'd like to see. The level is A+ but the retest is not that great. For now you can clearly see that market is looking at the level as well. I find it impressive time and time again to see how price reacts to the lines drawn in the sand... Update: Took 20% off the table and pulled the S/L a little closer. It's a risk free trade now and price is moving higher. 3/3 this week Update 2 : S/L pulled higher. Now a risk free trade turns into a gurantee winner. Update 3 : Exited the trade. Not giving away is an important characteristic. A small winner is always worth more than a small loser.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
EUR/NZD &amp; NZD/USD both seem to coming into play. Will wait till today's bar closes to decide but, I am leaning towards the NZD/USD. Mainly because of the massive resistance we have at the top and the fact that, we also have the WLCS is just a couple of pips above it. The 365 &amp; 150 EMA also have me leaning this way, they also give me a logical area to place the SL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yikes! We have more than a bearish pin bar. lol Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Yeah, it sucks big time. Waited and waited. then my expectations were dashed by the bars. Ah well, there will always be another setup. The good part of it is, we could predict that bearish PA before it even formed. A lot of people would envy that, and this is what J16 taught us.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Talking of another setup. If it finds support at 1.56000 as I think it will, we could have a setup next week.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
GBP/SGD also betrayed me. Only joking, the market does not care what our expectations are. Still, I like the divergence and the Major VBRN just above.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I think Ghous will like the look of this area. Can't get a much more clearer PPZ than this one.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Here is one that I was also watching very seriously. Despite the bearish Pin bar, I thought we were in for a retrace. And we were. As has been the theme for the last two weeks for me, yet another miss. lol. 3 pips this time. Its not over yet, but I can't afford it to hang around for very long because its a Friday anyway.

Two possible setups but, only one of them seems viable and even that has a close FTA. So, I am still sitting on my hands, before I scan the markets. other than these 8 pairs later.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Just scanned 80 charts in about 10 mins and came up with these two additions to my watch list. Edit. I am not so sure I like the lower area on GBP/CAD. I have the feeling it is going to retest the high above it.

I had actually missed the trade by a couple of pips like I mentioned in that post. That text was there for my reference and I forgot to take it off when I took the snapshot. Sorry if that created any confusion. g.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Ah, ok, thanks Ghous.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
I have a bad feeling about GBP/CAD at this possible area. Why drop it here, when they could allow it to rise to the next level and, then drop it.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
NZD/USD closed above the 150 EMA on Friday and opened above the 0.81000 &amp; the 365. After looking more closely at the SP (A), we can see there was a pullback and price went sideways before making the SP. SP (B) appears to be a much cleaner SP and just above the most recent SP, it would make sense to allow people with bullish sentiment, push price to that area before trapping them on the wrong side of the fence. Interested in what Ghous has to say about this way of thinking. I am wondering if, I am starting to over analyze this?

--- 帖子 #677 ---
hey PB, im not sure bout the gb/cad level, ur bad feelin might well be correct but i see that level as a major one...im thinkin if price takes that high out we will most likely see 1.6400 ?? check out the weekly. jon

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Yeah, John I was saying the same thing as you. What I was talking about, which I did not make very clear, was the SP for an SFP short, at this minor SP. I am also thinking it will break out. Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
jon

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I have been thinking about this EUR/NZD 3 pip penetration of the upper SP, a lot. That is why, I passed on it, my thinking was touch and go for a while, till I put myself in the mind frame of the major players.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi Ghous, After Fridays bar would you have re looked at this? Today we have an interesting bar too, almost making the same high before selling off. Do you have a time frame for entry i.e the next bar / TF ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Well, I was right and I was wrong, which is ok as, I am still working on this. The EUR/NZD 3 pip penetration that had me concerned, worked out and price hit the FTA. Interesting to note that, the next bar penetrated the level more deeply but, closed bullish and too far away from the level to make the trade viable. GBP/CAD behaved as I suspected and indeed as John mentioned, currently it has broken out of the level. NZD/USD was interesting also. I was concerned about the close of the bar between the 365 and 150 EMAs. Price then, rallied to the higher level which I mentioned looked a much better level from the perspective of the entry and exit from the level being more vigorous. However, once again price pierced the level and closed right above the FTA and the 0.8500 RN. Right now, there is little room for an entry and we have the VBRN of 0.8000 right above the STA. Ghous.. What do you think about the decisions I made with these setups. Don't hold any punches and hit me with it straight, please.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Ghous explains his entries on page 14.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
I should have elaborated more, I meant in relation to this particular set up, it looks like it stayed valid and Fridays bar gave a good entry. Even with Monday pushing higher we would have been safe where our stop was located above fakeout bar.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Friday's bar not being able to push beyond the 7500 round number with any authority and a Monday open underneath the 7500 actually made me pull the trigger on this one. For some odd reason I decided to tuck the stop loss under the fake out high and not beyond it like I normally do. In hindsight when I evaluate the decision I guess it was because I was hoping for the 7500 to hold straight away and drop in which case I would have further pulled the stop loss down and eliminated the bulk of the risk on the trade. Simply put I was asking a bit too much from this setup. It decided to fill a good bit of the fake out wick, took out my Stop loss and hen dropped exactly as I had hoped. But its great to see these stand out setups performing really well. Congrats to anybody out there who went for this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Anyone take this? It was on my watch list last week, the weekly level has a nice confluence on the daily where price is stalling, its corny but "flat tops equal drops" On the daily you can also see 365 MA at the level we are stalling too, I sold off yesterdays close.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Don't have anything to disagree with g.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I checked...and double checked...and triple checked but no, my live broker doesn't offer this. It hurt even more because I saw the setup first on my fxpro demo and then excitedly logged on to my live platform. This trading month has been teeeezzziiinggg! lol What an absolute beauty! Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Yeah, that is a nice one. Just one thing, I would like to clarify Ghous, if I may. While the swing Out of the above chart SP is great, the swing in seems to be rather minor. Is there a minimum swing size for both the SI &amp; SO or, do you not bother with this? I want you to disagree....So I can learn the small details, I need to.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
My expectations are high. However, what I would like to see and what I actually will see, may not be the same thing. This is where the cookie crumbles.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
So far good. This nice momentum creates space. If it would break the line and close above... I would definitely expect some major shoot to the north, like a 2day Pinbar... Thanks, Pinbar! You rock!

--- 帖子 #692 ---
This SFP from CAD CHF 4hr failed. Do you wait for confirmation (more 1hr or 4hr bars) before taking an intraday trade (I didn't take this trade because I read a Ghous post in where he said it's good to wait for more intraday bars)?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
It does not get more accurate than this!! Of course, there is a typo on the chart Both prices marked are the same - to the pip What a beautiful trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hey Steve, The depth of the swing point, the fake out bar length/shape, round numbers in the vicinity, MAs, traffic areas - all are only parts to the overall story around a trade setup. Yes, the swing point and the fake out bar together make the trigger for my method but its important to understand that they are still just elements to the bigger story. And the bigger story, hands down, is always the real reason to enter. You are right that that wasn't the deepest of swing points, but look at the clarity of your trouble areas. Look how price hurried beyond 1.03 BRN and came all the way back to close just about at it. Look at the strong break of the pin bar. Fake outs off RNs, I have mentioned before, can be extremely lucrative because beyond the added cushion and safety padding supplied by the round number you can sneak in a tighter stop. Essentially the ongoing story then revolves around the round number that you have in the area and that can be used to boost returns as well as manage risk well. Anyways, the point being that we have an HHR, a lovely shape on the fake out bar, 1.03 to play around with and clear target areas to make for a no brainer trade. g.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I have been burnt several times just like in that chart you showed. Thats why I came to the conclusion that trading fake outs straight off the fake out bar itself, on lower time frames is surely far more risky and aggressive than waiting for some confirming subsequent action. I am glad you passed this on. g.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
I hear you on the bigger story. Suppose it is like the ingredients of Rasmali, the ingredients themselves do not make this delicous dish, it is how they are combined and how the right balance of them makes the dish. Too many cardamons and it because way to pungent, too much sugar and it is sickly sweet. Looks like we have a similar thing going on with GBP/SGD but no trigger yet.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I got to sleep the whole night yesterday. Looking at that major trouble area just underneath there was no point even waiting for a trigger. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Yeah, that was what concerned me. Glad to see we are on the same page, still. Let's see what these three do. Not the GBP/CAD.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Ghous, when you have time, could you possibly explain a little about the next bar filling the fake out wick &amp;, show us an ideal example of the signature of a good setup. I am a bit confused about this wick filling concept. For example, are you talking about the next bar filling the upper part of the wick or the lower part. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I'll get back to this shortly... g.

I understand Ghous'es frustration. Edit: Update on the levels of the pairs I am watching. It is indeed frustrating and with major news out today on USD, I am going to pass on the USD/SGD possibility. Not really viable with this minor penetration with no other confluence going on, apart from the PPZ. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Failed to trigger by 0.0125 pips.... Aghhhhhh

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hey Steve, It could be either side of the wick on the bar. Depends on the story right? You have a big bullish pin bar at a historical region of support you won't be too inclined to believe that the wick on the bullish pin bar should get filled in (as in price should make its way down and fail the bullish pin bar). Like wise Price breaking out of an HHR level and the closing weakly but still above the HHR is a good sign that the next bar might continue using the HHR level as support and for a starter ooze through the space created by the wick to the upside. The wick in essence just represents opposing order flow coming in. Depending on the story this could indicate a reversal or weak order flow/profit taking which only benefits the trend as price now has a smoother path to move into (all the buy and sell orders have been consumed in the region of the wick). Hope this helps. g.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
yeah well, This has been a dodgy period of trading for sure, just another stage in the game and good idea to pass on the USD/SGD. This was making me flinch. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

Here was a 2 bar fake out on USD ZAR with close below BRN.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thanks Ghous Your example explains the wick getting filled in a failed setup well. How do we use the wick to get confirmation the SFP will work. By, the wick of the SFP bar, not getting attacked, and price failing to close within the wick?

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Its not so much about the existence of the wick itself as much as it has to do with where is the wick at. The other aspects of the story come in here. Round numbers in the vicinity, the depth and significance of the swing point, space back into the swing point, etc. g.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hmmmm Now, I am really confused. If it is not about the wick itself, why are we discussing the wick getting filled or not getting filled? Are we just talking about levels such as a PPZ, RN etc as in PA?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Because the wick contains the order flow that has either cleared the space for price to move through it, or triggered a true reversal. What I am saying is you can't determine whether the wick is likely to get filled or hold true by looking at the wick alone. The story around the wick is what elaborates on what you should be expecting price to do. As I mentioned before, wicks when held up can reverse long terms trends around (such as via a big pin bar) but when they fail to hold up they can create a vacuum for price to just move through and continue with the trend more strongly. Which of the scenarios is more likely is a guesstimate you can make by looking at the other factors at play. In the EUR/GBP charts I showed previously, the first bearish pin bar was right off major resistance and the wick that got created there was indicating more towards a true sell off. However on that second example on the same chart where I showed a bullish pin bar, it was headed into a major round number and I said that if price didn't shoot up straightaway its very likely to just drop into the wick as that would be the path of least resistance. When I refer to a wick being filled I am merely just pointing to a market phenomena not a trigger to any trades or anything in that context. g.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Agh, Now I get it. For some reason, I could not get my mind around that second chart and the wick. So in a nutshell, we are looking for the momentum around the upper part of the wick to not only hold but, orders to get triggered around that area before a bullish SFP bar has the wick tested in the lower section of it. This mechanism appears to be the reverse of the IPB. Thanks Ghous, it is making sense.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I read that at least 5 times and couldn't make out what you're saying. Could you rephrase this? g.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Sorry Yeah, it is a bit confusing. Ok, I mean, after the Swing Failure, ideally are we looking for price to not enter the wick of the previous bar at all but, aggressively move towards the high of the failure bar? Obviously a close below the SP is going to take us out, is it not? As a close below is going to enter the wick of the SP failure bar.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hi all, There are so many valuable info about market like so many threads out there, How can you analysis or predict EU or GU or EJ .... according to this strategy for next week ( just about 40 % not more than it ) ? Best all

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Just about 40% what?

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I see what you mean. Well, ideally that's exactly what you want to see i.e price shooting off straight away without any attempts to fill in the wick. However the length of the wick provides the trade setup with the breathing space. Because the stops go beyond the fake out high/low it essentially means that given the strength of the setup you are willing to hold on to the trade up until the point it decides to take the stop out or completely fill the fake out wick . I have seen many instances where price ends up filling the fake out wick partially before heading in our direction. Here's an example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Again the point that you make is totally valid that the best setups will always work straight away (just like we know the great pin bars at great locations like to break quick) but you don't get the "ideal scenario" to munch on all the time. That's where a wider more logical stop placement beyond the fake out high/low makes most sense. Again we are isolating topics here for the sake of discussion but obviously a lot of other factors will come into play to determine what you want to make out of price looking to fill in the wick of a fake out bar. For a mediocre setup this could be the silence you get before a storm. For a stronger setup this could mean the hunt for more liquidity (perhaps to launch a massive assault). g.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hey Kami, Nothing much on either of those pairs for me right now. The purpose of a trading method is not to make out what price is looking to do on a certain pair all the time but to sniff out the occasional favorable setups where things line up for you nicely. In that context, like I just mentioned, nothing for me on either of those pairs. g.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Many thanks for the detailed explanation Ghous, it helps a lot. The GBP/NZD has been on my books for a while now. However, the close being below the VBRN makes it tricky to get in. I imagine you are already in it off of the 2.000 today. I got up too late for an entry at that point this morning.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
This is more experimental than the actual SFP as Friday's bar close slightly below the SP. I am thinking that, the combination of the area between the Daily LCS at 0.7185 &amp; the SP at 0.7191 will hold as a combination of support. Even though the close of the Friday's bar was actually 0.7189, 1.1 pips below the SP low. Price seems to have already tested the low of Friday's bar and shied away from it.

Hey there, I am not Steve, but to answer your question, that line you drew is what I refer to as HHR or H ighest H igh or R esistance of a swing point. Its the reference line I use to watch the bar close on the fake out. So in case of an HHR, the fake out bar must close below the HHR. In the reverse scenario the level is referred to as LLS or L owest L ow of S upport which again serves the same purpose. The fake out bar this time must close above the LLS line. Hope this is clear. g.

Yeah, they also had me a bit concerned, that is why I decided to enter just before the break of the PB. Damn, I intended to close out 2/3 of the USD/CHF but closed out the entire position by mistake. Well, it was a fair trade. When will you open your thread Ghous? Can't wait. You must be at BE right now?

Oops! Never mind at all. As they say shit happens. Like you said, a fair trade anyhow. My SL is reduced to a half bar one. Watching this very closely from here on. The thread's on its way...I am arranging the material. g.

Sorry, I missed this post. Yeah, that is an SFP. The gap was not big enough to be a factor though and, the 1.7000 area was a concern, as Ghous previously mentioned.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Great news..... Yeah, it is always best to get the basic material together and post it all in one go before people start posting. Indeed, I think my trigger finger got rusty and and just pulled the trigger on the whole trade instead of a partial profit. There will always be another setup. Sounds like, you don't believe in partial profit. I don't like the way GBP/JPY is lingering around just above the middle of the former consolidation box. Pulled the plug on it for BE+

Thanks for the reply. But I spoke about it's gap that formed the SFP, Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Oh, I now get what you are saying but, I think you are mistaking the SFP for the Swing point. The Swing High or Swing Low is where we look for price to pierce the area and close above or below the level, the closing above or below of the bar is actually the SFP. That gap high, is the SP for the current SFP but, the gap now has no part in this, at all. It is just another Swing High.

I am flat now. That swing point is sticking out like a sore thumb! Price has done nothing so far to make this decision easy for me as it is looking good for a drop but I can't afford a bounce off here. Its been a dodgy month for me and we are into the last trading week, I'd rather prefer to take and sit on the sure pips then play the "hope" game for now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

Thank you. All understood

Yes, it has been a rather frustrating month but, that is how the market works, as you previously said. I like what you said about, waiting for the crème de la crème of setups. The daily TF allows us to really wait and observe a setup before deciding to take it or pass. I am starting to like the Daily TF, a lot. Yeah, don't want to start using that four letter word. HOPE.

Thanks, g! Thank you very much! I guess I'll have something to read tonight

EUR/CAD is on my watch list.

What think of this pair? Price collides with well defined support and the new bar makes a small SFP, against TL. Would be good to let it ripen more, before we become? What the teacher says Ghous?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
I am not Ghous but, for me that SP is just too small. Combined with the close below the TL I drew, it is just not viable.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Totally agree, Price seems to be getting less and less afraid of the lower trend line and I wouldn't be too keen taking a long back into the wedge again specially now that its really constricting. Attached Image (click to enlarge) g.

THIS THREAD IS NOW ON HOLD. Ghous opened his own thread and I am over there learning with him. The order flow is what all these methods are about so, if anyone wants to learn further, please visit the "Mastering The Art of Trading" thread and read from post 1.
