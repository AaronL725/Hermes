I'd like to begin with " The piano can't kill the player because it doesn't like the sound of the music' " WESTWORLD Series https://gomovies.to/film/westworld-s...html?ep=506388 Inserted Video Inserted Video Inserted Video Inserted Video The videos above are allegory to traders, EA, back testing, winning, losing, life etc. Those robot hands are the zigcharm lines guiding traders, put things in order and give clear perspective. Anyhow I'm trying to play a music score of a MACD into a chart in a form of a zigzag. That way we dance to its music. Treat the buyer/seller as the piano player, market instrument (i.e. EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY etc) as the piano, we who use zigzag is the dance participant. 1 moves forward, 2 moves backward, 3 moves forward, like tap dance. Medium uses a 12,26,9 MACD Soft uses 4,5,3 MACD Hard uses 21,55,7 MACD The new leg is created when the Signal and Macd line crossed over. From this you will get the idea of the market structure of the MACD Input on each Time frame. There are 3 type of sensitivity: soft, medium, hard. For higher time frame D1 and above, better use soft. For lower time frame use any kind of sensitivity is ok. Basically Medium and Hard is too see the outline of the trend. Soft is to see the inner working of the outline trend. You will see it in action in the next few posts or pages of this forum. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the data window, pay attention to the Bias. When the Bias switches from -1 to 1, that mean we have a new lower low or higher low which means either be a bullish reversal or a correction. Goes the same when it changes from 1 to -1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is a powerful indicator when combine it with 2 EMAs 26 and 12 and have a comprehensive knowledge in market structure! Example will be shown Everyone is welcome to share their ideas applying this zigzag.

Before we go to the example. I want to give overview of the DataWindow. Several points to point out 1. The data window of this indicator, the output name will change whenever the sensitivity of that particular period is change. For instance D1 uses Medium, so the the Index output will be Index medium. 2. - ZigZag Price is the low/high zigzag appeared at what price - OS/OB is Oversold 1 or Overbought -1 - Index is at what index or candle does the high/low appear at. Let say the high appeared at 10, that mean 11th candles from the right or from candle 0. - Bias is the bias of the market, bearish -1 or bullish 1

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks I appreciate it. Maybe you guys can give some feedback on this Indicator please. Or maybe share your own strategy using this indicator would be cool!

USDJPY daily Notice the EMAs 12 and 26 crossed The red boxes transitioned the Bias from 1 to -1. We should take the trade on the open of the second bar that is shown in the vertical line. There is price bounce off the EMAs, which mean a trend continuation or we just had a correction of the 1st or 3rd bearish/bullish legs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GBPUSD H4 (Medium sensitivity) Notice the EMAs 12 and 26 crossed The red boxes transitioned the Bias from -1 to 1.

EURUSD H4 In this example we combine 2 ZigZag Medium (red) and Soft (green). Use the medium as the outline of the trend. Soft as the inside trend in the outline trend. As seen in the screenshot Leg 1,2,3 Medium zigzag consists of several soft zigzags. In leg 2, we have a correction and then follow with an impulse move to the downside 3rd leg. Notice leg 2 medium and soft zigzag bounces off the EMAs Attached Image (click to enlarge)

USDCAD D1 (soft and hard) Expecting a RED leg up is created sometime this week which will follow with a correction to the downside. We also have an inside bar at the top of 2A, indicating a reversal or a retracement. The correction target is 76.8% retracement of 2A before going higher or 50% of 1A and 2A Attached Image (click to enlarge)

USDCHF 4HR Medium and Soft At the edge of the world. Make or break moment. The 1X could either be the 1st Bear's leg or just simply a bullish correction. 1X consists of 5 waves a 3rd leg (3X) will be appear when we have a price breakout of 2X and the lower price than the 5th leg of 1X. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
USDCHF D1 Alternative (Medium and Soft) Overall trend is down because we have consecutive Lower High and Lower Low. We could have a head and shoulder pattern appearing on the D1 chart. So this chart is a must watch. Expect strong USD if it manages to break the "LH/Neck Line 1" Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the previous USDCHF 4hr analysis able to made the start of leg 3X, then we should expect to see a new lower low or a failed head and shoulder.

Nice mate. AUDUSD 1HR A selling setup when the price closes below that dashed horizontal line 0.7518. Target 10 to 20 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

NZDUSD Daily (Soft) First we began with a bearish reversal at the top of wave 1 or leg 1. The bearish reversal pattern was a head and shoulder. Now.... We have accomplished 5 waves move down. The 5th wave ends with a bullish divergence from Leg 3 to Leg 5 (highlighted in blue lines). Expect to buy this sucker when the daily candle closes above 0.69194 Or Buy when tomorrow NZDUSD news are above expected. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

nzd is alwas pain..lol let\s see

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Yes I think you're thinking we have a head and shoulder in the 1hr. In short term, selling this sucker is ok. But I'd rather wait for the US news and NZ news to come up first. That way we can tell if the H&amp;S pattern is a valid one. In my option that the H&amp;S pattern could be invalid because that move up is shorter compare to the previous over 2 months of bear market.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
This is a bit tricky mate. LOL. When I go over the 4hr chart The setup doesn't look attractive or promising. There's possibility to the upside unless we have the market broke below Leg 2. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

i will not touch this bitch untill see good set up ..lol..for geo-political and lot of chaos market is not in correct oder so no hold position just take pip ..keep pip and run..imho

GBPUSD Daily 3 Things 1. Head and Shoulder where the N2 is lower than N1. Then follow with the break above of N2 and N1 2. Triangle pattern appeared in a H&amp;S pattern which turns out to be a reversal. As seen in the triangle the bearish moves are getting weaker everytime it wanted to make a failed new low which follow with an explosive upside move. 3. Ascending momentum These 3 things give a confirmation that GBPUSD is about to do a bullish reversal This week during the FED Interest rate and NFP will be the decision point. Anyhow the fish net is ready Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I took 10 pips profit of it. Becareful Why because I think we already at 50% and bullish EMA crossed That's why I'm not too keenly look for above 20 pips profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Additional NZDUSD Daily analysis Notice those bearish bars inside the white box, it shrinking in size. It ends up to be a doji and inside bar (highlighted in red box). We could have a inside bar breakout to the upside which means it's a reversal. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you look at it from the lower time frame, we have a Head and Shoulder pattern. Notice we have a descending triangle pattern inside the H&amp;S pattern which has been broke It will be a valid H&amp;S when the 4H candle closes above N1 and N2 A bullished EMA crossed will be a strong signal in the 4H chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It seems good

--- 帖子 #38 ---
NZDUSD is so bullish Condition has been met Expect to buy this sucker when the daily candle closes above 0.69194 Or Buy when tomorrow NZDUSD news are above expected. Took 50 pips of profit already.

Further detail to the additional Bullish fail switch plan As seen in the screenshot we could have a potential Head and Shoulder pattern. The 2nd shoulder follows with a weakening of the bull or bull trap. The H&amp;S is confirmed when we have it broke both of the neck line. By broke I mean not a whip tail but a real candle open and close below N1. Target is 76.4% of the FIB. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

hi mate in this chart you show last leg /hi cross with red candle right ..is it possible when last left leg break up or down it draw vertical line and if possible also draw horizontal line at break point as i draw manually in many image i already upload .any question plz don't hesitate to ask..

--- 帖子 #59 ---
NZDUSD H1 Looking forward to see a Higher Low leg exists on the ZigCharm Medium before buying this sucker. Expecting zigCharm Higher Low leg to appear at 76.4% FIB retracement. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
if that is shown, then this indicator will be a buy/sell signal. I don't intent to make this indicator as a buy/sell signal but as an visual aid for traders to analyse the market structure clearer (hopefully). Or let me rephrase that this indicator is for putting the fish net line for catching the fish. The fisherman catches the fish using its own setup not the net it self, the net is just a tool for the fisherman to set and catch if you know what i mean. Anyhow I can draw a vertical and horizontal line when there's a transition between Bias 1 to -1 vice versa.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I will see what I can come up with over the weekend mate.

I still hold my bullish view/bias. I have my bullish fail switch plan but I don't look forward to it.

Notice the bullish hidden divergence of the bottom of the first impulse leg and the bottom of the retracement. We have a lower momentum on the low of the retracement than on the low of the first impulse leg. So I bet, it goes higher. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Didn't expect it would continue down that far, crap.... Gotta wonder the FED news would be a doji in the 4hr chart. Better yet a bullish engulfing pattern. That way we have a double bottom. ALternatively just sell this sucker.

This is a very interesting methodology to calculate Zig-Zag, have you tried other oscillators also?

A proven over and over again until the 2nd coming of Christ break out strategy pattern 1.382 FIB Notice in the picture we have Green and yellow boxes.

EURUSD If the medium leg has been made and it disrespected the FIB 1.382. If the soft leg got higher high then we have a double top. Then we have a confirmation of a bearish divergence which means that we had a 5th leg up. Usually and most of the time the 5th leg is a divergence or convergence. Also from we might have also have a fake fib 1.382 breakout if it disrespected FIB 1.382 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now we have several new inputs in ZigCharm2 I think it's self explanatory already. I want to add something that if you want to have another FIB EX let say 1.5 and 1.618 then you should type it as 1.5,1.618 Make sure there's a coma after your number. Regarding the FibEx, it can only be on only if the "Frame of reference" is set to true. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I want to let you traders know that I just notice there's a minor bug in the code that if you want to draw FIB EX on 2 zigcharm2 or more, there's a conflict. But this won't affect the indicator information. Just a GUI conflict in naming and ID.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
IDENTIFYING MOMENTUM IN ZIGCHARM You can also treat the FIB 1.382 as the momentum. The red arrow has smaller momentum compare to the black arrow. The black arrow took the red arrow's upside Fib EX 1.382 which means a breakout. On NFP we expect a correction which was a bearish move that has a small momentum compare to the previous rally. Therefore any news off the NFP either was positive or negative or any kind of news, a buy is recommended in the brown arrow area or the correction phase I use the SOFT MODE on H4 chart in the screenshot Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's why I was expecting a 5 leg move correction (I mean ABCDE correction) over Firday last NFP which was a fake out or a bullish divergence on that particular firday correction

I fear have seen that before - mixing retail forex trading with religion is one of the worst combinations out there. Something that happens if you are close to the point of losing your sanity. Religion can never give you guidance in trading, but it is kind of an immune system of your soul to cope with extreme negative situations....so if one combines trading with religion, it's most likely because his soul is close to a breaking point facing reality. Shut down your trading software and focus on those who still love you. Their love is the real treasure in your life you should hunt for - not retail forex. Good luck.

Rome 14 The Weak and the Strong 14 Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters. 2 One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. 3 The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them. 4 Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand. 5 One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. 6 Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. 7 For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. 8 If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 9 For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. 10 You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister[ a ]? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat. 11 It is written: “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.’”[ b ] 12 So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. 13 Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. 14 I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. 15 If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died. 16 Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil. 17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, 18 because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval. 19 Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. 20 Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. 21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall. 22 So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves. 23 But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.[ c ]

I just demonstrated you that trading is easy Be objective, not subjective. Subjective is misleading, i.e. following news bull crap like that. (you may disagree, fyi i dont need your fucking approval because I've been living in hell many many many many fucking time fucking poor souls) See the picture in a frame by frame. Do you know an anchor? That small little thing anchored a ship in a fixed place. I mean you have to get the anchor in order to know the market. In my strategy my anchor is those stars! Little square or a rabbit hole or an eye of a needle or a fucking retracement/correction. For instance you have to know whether we are in a consolidation phase or trending phase or a reversal phase. That's simple when you have master the Elliot wave theory. So many free resources out there in the internet which you can learn. No need to buy it with the money you don't have. That's robbery in disguise. After that you should know the momentum of the market. You can identify it from the size of the candle. If you're seeing 5 bearish candles and each candle is shrinking in its size, that mean the momentum is depleting. It's a bear trap if you sell that piece of shit. Better you see if there's a big bullish candle that engulfed the previous candles long wick and so-so body is fine. You can also use volume in order to identify the new bull candle strength. This story goes the same as in the bearish situation. Then you look for a reversal pattern which usually occur in that particular market. In EURUSD, H&amp;S mostly occur. H&amp;S occur in many many market instrument. Double top/bottom would be nice, but that is like a tounge of a snake. Sometimes can be bullshit. You may also use Harmonic pattern as well. But you gotta know the context! Does these pattern appear at the strong SR area? You may use FIB 1.382 to identify that. Like I have shown you in couple screenshots (Bull shark shit like that). Life is already complicated, don't make it too complicated with bull shit. We all want to make money, not to make bull shit art work. What else..... I'm still thinking

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Fuck I almost forgot You must get SR levels right. You should use the FIB EX on the previous box in order to get the SR. And you may also use the anchor (stars that I talked about). I have shown you this over and over again like a fuckin broken record! I think that should be all. I will let you know if I can think of anything else.

I highly suggest you do not use renko. Renko is good to identifying the whole market movement and simple to see. But it's not good for sniping or decision processing or pulling the trigger. I prefer candlestick for accuracy. I want accuracy not discounting the price visual.

Story about Elliot Impulse Wave 1. Once upon a time there's a fuck boy. Fuck boy loves to fuck and kill around. Out of the blue he killed some one next to him. 2. He stopped for a moment and see the blood on his hand and reconcile what he had done. However he enjoy doing it. 3. So he continue killing every body he sees 4. He stopped again and became cold, agitated. Moved back and forth like a fucktard [bigger correction than the 2nd correction). He starting to get exhausted but the fire in him draw the devil out again. 5. So he continued again with all of his strength, killing every one he can see. However not as much as the 3rd wave. Suddenly his energy depleted and died slowly. The end.

Just noticed AUDUSD Bullish scenario Looking forward to what Monday will bring. The death of me or life. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Additional detail. If the price broke through that particular Anchor (SR). Closing the losing position is a wise choice and look for a sell setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #551 ---
TERMINOLOGY 1. Anchor/Center of Gravity - the little thing that anchored the price. In other word Anchor is a SR (Support and Resistance) 2. Dwarf Star or Star of Betlehem or eye of a needle- the retracement after an impulse move. The first impulse move preferably should break its previous box' MOM. The retracement or consolidation should be brief and quick and form a higher low or lower high leg. If the higher low or the lower high leg doesn't appear quickly, then it should have a small Fib 1.382 MOM. Look for a triangle trend continuation pattern in term of price or MOM (contraction). Surely after that will be follow with a strong/explosive move to the respective trend. 3. FIB EX - it is the Fibonacci extension to the top&amp;bottom of each frame. It has 2 functions, to a display the momentum of that particular frame which you can use it to compare its MOM in relative to its previous/recent frame. You could also use the FIB EX as the SR (Support and Resistance). 4. MOM - Momentum Will be updated.......

--- 帖子 #552 ---
GOLD D1 Analysis Bias Live is bearish (Red wired box) mixed with bullish (green box). This indicate uncertainty in the bias. Adding more detail to the bearish scenario. The Red wired box broke the previous box MOM which colored in Black. That indicates that we could be in a bearish market in the future. This has to be confirm with the price to get corrected into the black box area which apparently Fib 0.382 appears in that area as well. So if the price reach that particular FIB and deflected back down then it is recommended to look for a sell opportunity. Bullish scenario, market is able to retrace above 0.618 Fib Retracement. This is tricky. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #553 ---
EURJPY H1 Bias is mixed of Bearish (Medium) and Bullish (Soft). Trend is sideway (No frame/box breaks above/below previous box' MOM). Verdict, Bull shit until we see a break above/below of previous box' MOM Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #554 ---
GBPJPY D1 Bias is a mix. We broke previous Frame' MOM which it became a SR if the shit hits the fan. Expecting a correction to 0.382 where there we also have an anchor point (SR in red font with black box). The price is attracted to that particular anchor point. We may have a correction week this week. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

identifying the dwarf star or star of bethlehem I think I have explained this before. But I want to make it clear and take one example from XAUUSD market. As seen in the screenshot there are 2 time frames, daily and 4 hour time frame. 1. We have to identify if there's any FibEx breakout of the previous frame/box. In this case we have a breakout the lower FibEx of the previous FibEx in the 4hr chart. 2. After that it follows with a correction. It very important to have the correction at .382 Fib retracement. It's ok if it makes .618 ret, but it should go back to .382 Fib ret immediately 3. When the retracement completed, execute the order according to the breakout direction. In this case we had a bearish breakout therefore sell. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Another example It's ok if it retraced more than .382, just make sure it get back to .382 immediately. JUST MAKE SURE THE RETRACEMENT DOESN'T GO LOWER INTO THE BOX TERRITORY MARKED IN X LIke in this example Attached Image (click to enlarge)

this indi doesn't tell you buy/sell signal. There are some works that needs to be done on your end which requires your trading experience. This indi helps traders to identify winning setups, support resistance, harmonic, sniping, scalping, reversal pattern, trend continuation, elliot wave. Hopefully with this indi traders can take better and clear decision if you follow merely on the bias, most likely you will lose big time just like many blackbox indi that gives arrow/histogram shit like that.

I just find it strange... many traders believe their system is good and gives good result.... But why wouldn't they take high risk? That is like driving a Ferrari at 5km/hr. Bull shit. Better go walk then. Furthermore I dont think no body can live with $2 to $10 per day. Low Life kind of living.

Ill help you out a bit here. Macds and in fact ALL moving averages tell you is the momentum. Thats great but its only ONE SMALL LAYER. In fact out of the ten or so layers needed to enter a trade momentum is pretty down the list. Hence why you lose. There you go. No need to thank me pay it forward.

Yes sir there is. I couldn't proof the difference, but when you compare it side by side, you should see the difference. This indi is more accurate to the little retracement. That little retracement can be use as a SR levels which I have shown in previous posts. Please kindly spend some of your valuable time over my thread. I'm sorry for the swearing in the thread recently. It was used for training purpose, like military style in hell. I hope you know what I mean. God bless

Attached Image (click to enlarge) 0. A weak bull moved to the upside broke the previous frame' FibEx Up and we had lots of bearish divergences up there. Why weak because the color is not dark green instead a yellowGreen color which indicate weakness in the bull. Furthermore it means that that particular frame has lower volume in relative to the previous bullish move (which was colored in dark green, can be seen in the screenshot) 1. The bear managed to breaks 0's FibEx Lo 2. Followed with a high volume bullish correction but it has the momentum is compact and about to explode! [Dwarf Star] 3. Price exploded. It manages to break 2's FibEx Lo. However, the volume is lower in relation to 1 as seen in the color of frame #3 is not red but colored in salmon 4. Price correction with low bull vol and compact momentum. Another dwarf star but with low energy of explosion 5. Exploded to the downside. But it didn't break Frame #4 FibEx Lo. This mean the bear is weakening 6. A very strong bull correction to the upside but the MOM (FibEx and FibLo) is smaller than the previous MOM. This means that the bull is about to take control. 7. Bear trap, a bearish with low vol and unable to break previous FibEx Lo. Notice we had a bullish divergence! 8. A laid back bullish took control with low volume 9. Suddenly bearish becoming so small that it became a bullish correction. A potential Dwarf Star because the MOM is so compact and the volume is low. The explosion could be small or big. This depend on the Fundamental news came on that particular day. On that day we had a high impact news so the explosion should be big to the upside. Notice we had a bullish hidden divergence 10. Bull exploded and took control. Obliterated previous FibEx Up and it has higher volume in relative to the 8's bull volume. BULL RUNNNNN Trading is so easy The end

Understanding the Volume Shade of The Frame 1. Frame A Colored in green which means it has a higher volume in relative to frame B. Frame B and Frame A has the same direction (bullish). Therefore frame B has lesser bullish volume/demand compare to Frame A 2. Frame C is colored in pale red because it has lower volume in relation to it's previous bearish frame which was Bearish Frame D 3. Frame D is colored in red because it has higher volume in relation to it's previous bearish frame which was Bearish Frame E So in conclusion the frame is colored based of it's volume in relation to the similar frame direction in the previous frame. Frame A &gt; Frame B Frame C &lt; Frame D Frame D &gt; Frame E Dark green = Bullish with higher volume compare to the previous bullish frame Light blue green (pale green) = Bullish with lower volume compare to the previous bullish frame Red = Bearish with volume that is higher volume compare to the previous bearish frame Pale Red = Bearish with volume that is lower volume compare to the previous bearish frame Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Another Bearish Divergence Case Frame A&lt;B&lt;C Then we had a strong last bull move up or a bull trap which can't breaks the FIBEX UP highlighted in red box. After the bull trap, came a strong bear move with high volume and follow with a sideway move (notice no frame break the previous frame FibEx up/lo). Then finally a bear frame with high volume broke the previous frame's FibEx Lo which indicates the bear is taking control. //Sorry for the typo, broker should be broke Attached Image (click to enlarge)

According to the definition above (in the quote). Bullish Hidden Divergence = Higher Low in price and Higher High in Indicator. Let's see in ZigCharm3XDVL (Divergence/Hidden Divergence + Volume) We have consecutive HH, HL. A we had HL with larger volume compare to B therefore it's larger than C A &gt; B &gt; C Therefore it's a bullish trend continuation or hidden bullish divergence = great opportunity to LONG!

Not being rude mate. "Just trade the pullback you idiot!" Yes it's possible if the bull continue going higher. We should allow the bull to go higher by waiting in the sideline so we can jump in later in the pullback However in the H4 we could have a BEARISH HIDDEN DIVERGENCE! Price made LL and HL.

Now we are in a Bull move up with high Volume and it's stuck under the FIB Retracement .618. If the frame completed, we could have a Bearish Hidden Divergence. We'll see...

EURUSD Analysis Frame B broke above A2's upper FibEx. However the volume of B&lt;A1's volume which equals to a bearish divergence. The color of B's frame is pale green which mean that it has lower volume in relative to the previous bullish frame which is Frame A1. After the divergence, followed with a bearish frame "C" with a higher volume in relative to frame A2's bearish volume. However it did not break B's lower FibEx in order to confirm bear in control. Then recently we had a new Frame D, with a higher volume in relation to the previous bullish frame, frame B. That mean we have a bearish hidden divergence because bearish hidden divergence = Lower High in price + higher high in indi. Frame D's price is lower than B's close and the volume of D is higher than B's. Frame D's colored in bright green indicates a higher volume in relation to the previous bullish frame; Frame B. BUT!!!!! We do not have a LOWER LOW yet. We should have a LOWER LOW if Frame C was able to close below Frame B. In this case it didn't. That mean we do not have Hidden divergence yet. Furthermore no frame has broke it's previous lower FIB EX in order to confirm the bear in control. Therefore the verdict is SIDEWAY MOVE with bullish tone as B broke A2's upper FibEx.

USDJPY Weekly analysis. Looking from above We had a strong upward move drawn in blue channel. Now we are in a correction phase of that upward move. It began with Frame B (colored in red) broke Frame A's lower FibEx (colored in pale green). Until Frame C, we had a lower volume (colored in pale red) in bear in relation to Frame B's volume. That equals to bullish divergence. So the Bull did took control and able to broke Frame C's upper FibEx. Now we are in a bullish correction "Frame E". It has a higher volume of bear compare to Frame C's bearish volume. Therefore expect a Bullish Hidden Divergence / bullish trend continuation sometime this month or next month. In addition to that the Fib retracement .382 is holding Frame E as a support. Let see if that will hold up. Verdict is we are still in a sideway move but caught in between the bull and bear. At the moment the bear is taking control "Frame E" in a form of a bullish correction. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A) There was a high demand selling USDJPY B) There's a decrease in volume/demand in buying USDJP So that mean a bearish breakout could happen shortly. But idk if this will be a bigger bearish demand in relation to the previous Bearish Frame A's volume. Probably the color will be pale red which indicates a low demand.

Hi username you need an indicator that produces range bar charts offline. There are some already posted on FF. You'll find one on my journal as well. These days I use a commercially available one from (ovo.com.cz ) I am not affiliated or trying to market their product. I've found it to be very stable on MT4. You can select the bar size of your choice and their product allows you to change bar size on your charts. Very useful if you want to check the trend on a higher bar size. On a side note - Please be careful not to use the Lords name in vain! He is the King of kings and Lord of lords and the world's Savior! We need to respect that. If only more would acknowledge that fact we would see a change in the unfolding of events and a great hope for the future. However the Scriptures tell us that the current situation will get worse before He returns then everything will be put right and renewed as promised. Please check which side of the judgement seat you will end up on. Prayerfully and Respectfully yours. Bat

I have to say this is the best winning setup that traders should looking for when using ZigCharm. The best breakout strategy. Notice those things highlighted in red. The frames and its momentum shrank which equals to consolidation phase or sideway move or no clear trend. Then came a big frame engulfed those previous frames and ate all the Momentums. Then followed with a retracement that can't penetrate the smallest frame or the retracement that tested the last smallbox's Momentum. Finally a deflection to the downside. Btw, thank you for providing the screenshots. This is a great example of a winning trade setup or breakout setup! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Basically when you are in an up trend... An oversold frame with small momentum is a bullish retracement When you are in a down trend... An overbought frame with small momentum is a bearish retracement Meaning that the retracement is a buying/selling opportunity.

AUDUSD H1 Identifying Eye/ (S/R) / Overbought Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Hi username. Unfortunately your lovely EA doesn't cope well with my current range bar chart. I'm trying to replicate a tick chart and use range bars of 2 points (roughly the size of the spread for the Asian market for EUR/USD) and your EA will repaint and cough and splutter. This is very distracting from trying to watch the price action. The reason for such a small range bar is to take advantage of ANY move in the Asian session which can have less volatility than Europe but it suits my time zone. This chart can move very fast! But I like to make my money quickly then go do other much more important things. My chart analysis is very simple. Mark the last confirmed LH or HL. It is confirmed by the market moving past that line making a new HH or LL. Just follow the waves up or down with your line. (You can find lots of info on this style or trading on the Animal Farm thread - though they didn't use range bars there.) Once the market breaks the line I watch for laddering on my VMA rainbow this is simply a head and shoulders pattern.(Lots of info on the VMA in my journal) Just trade the first hour of market opening. After this Asia can be frustratingly flat and take all your money back! Keep up the good work. Blessings Bat

I showed you the how to identify the center of gravity using your eyes. Here is a math version First must identify the HL and HH of the recent trend. Take the HL as Support and calculate as seen in the screenshot. The formula consists of the lowest HL and the highest HL diveded by 2 Correction the later formula B-((C-A)/2 should be C-((C-A)/2 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Another example First you must identify the trend. Connect the 1st LH to the 2nd LH and use the 2nd LL as the bottom trend. When the trend channel broke, use the formula to identify the center of that trend gravity and begin long until it reaches the c.gravity of that respective trend. When the price touches the c.gravity, you may consider selling it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GBPUSD Daily COG MACD zCharm Medium there are 2 COGs The small purple trendline got broke and the 2nd COG got touched. The black trendline has not been broke above. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Basically the price center of gravity is like haggling or 50% discount of certain trendy product. When you haggle usually you ask for half of the price right... And when the price met half way, for sure you'd buy the product right? I mean let say in the house market. You index all the house price against the time (X axis). Across the time line you should see a trend. When you see the trend up, you look for the lowest prices. Take the lowest and highest of the low prices and divided by 2 = the price you want to buy. So when you buy the house you use that particular price to buy the house. When the market went down, you use that price to buy the houses all you want. That way the seller is willing to sell the house for you in a bad market situation. Seller don't want to sell their house too low or too high. So take the lowest low and highest low divided by 2 = what the seller price want. So it's a win-win situation.

If it's bullish add the frame's+MOM For bearish case subtract it Bullish Dynamic SR = last frame's price - MOM Bearish Dynamic SR = last frame's price + MOM 4. Increase the Bullish dynamic SR every time the current price close is higher than the previous candle's high. Decrease the bearish dynamic SR every time the current price close is lower than the previous candle's low. Bullish Dynamic SR = (Current candle close - previous candle close)+dynamic SR Bearish Dynamic SR = (Previous candle close - current candle close)-dynamic SR 5. When a candle broke particular dynamic SR, repeat #1

Attached Image Active S/R or the C.O.G (Center of Gravity) Attached Image The more the candle the stronger it is (theoretically). I often set it between 5 to 30 depending on the timeframe. The shorter the timeframe, the more strength you should input. I have also attached the template Let me know if you need anything.

EURUSD recent bullish example First we had a downtrend, it broke X and then follow with ABC pattern. You should look to place a long position when it broke above 2(B) and broke the 3(C) supertrend Attached Image (click to enlarge)

We had 1,2,3,4,5 bullish Elliot wave. Follow with consolidation at after the break of 5th leg supertrend. Short when the price broke the 5th leg supertrend and went into the 3rd leg supertrend territory. Make sure the supertrend color is bearish before placing the short position drawn in circles Attached Image (click to enlarge)

btw that rectangle, wave count and circle objects is drawn manually (not drawn by the indi) but the other lines are drawn by the system

Please explore this indi's new feature and share something your experience/findings here. I appreciate it.

Hi, This may sound like a foolish question but has anyone thought of trying this indicator on Renko charts...Just placed it on a couple of 10 pip charts...Interesting. If I am out of order posting this question yourername please advise and I shall remove it immediately. Cheers, Ronald

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Hello Ced74. Yes there were several users posted using Renko charts and found no problem using this indi with it. Your post is not out of order, I appreciate you asked, in fact I'm happy somebody is interested using this indi. Please feel free to post anything you use with this indi and we'll share some insight. Cheers mate

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
To all, FYI i'm not gonna charge anything or give you paid training for using this indi. My life is fulfilled, enlightened, living in a green pasture. So I'd like to share my joy with y'all through this strategy. This strategy is not a straight forward strategy. It requires your trading experience. This indi does not breast fed you, you have to get your spoon and feed your self. This indi isn't like any other indi that gives you signal to buy/sell. You may improvise this indi to your liking and wield it to your advantage. It's flexible.

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Thanks for your reply yousername....I have been using Renko for over 10 years...Only came upon this thread a couple of hours ago so will play around with it. Regards, Ronald

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
I will reboot this thread soon with a new thread. I will organize it with examples of the past as much as I can. This thread is still relevant although a new thread (continuation of this) will start. So please stay tune.

EURUSD H4 So we had a doji with small body compare to its tail and it follow with a big bear bar. Take each end of the super trend (highlighted in black colored circle) as S/R If it broke to the highest/lowest S/R then the likely hood the trend going to that respective direction is higher. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ok i gotta run. Good luck

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Afternoon, Renko appears to be a Challenge with this indicator but will spend some more time with it .No high hopes at this point in time but I do like a challenge. Ronald

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
EURUSD Daily As seen in the screenshot, I plot those arrows to point you that we are in a major SR levels. Break to either side determine the trend. If it broke to the downside then we could have either a bullish correction for several days or a bearish reversal (long term). In addition to that I put the resistance strength to 10. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Good afternoon to you too Ronald Frankly I don't know how to setup Renko Chart. Could you please show me how to do it so I can figure out what the problem is? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Good afternoon. I didn't expect to see such a good trader coming from China.Your deal is systematic, the gas brothers

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Yousername I have remove the indicator from the Renko charts Currently does not work for me...O.K may work on 30-50 pip bricks but repaints badly on smaller brick size..e.g..10 pip bricke Renko is not as easy as the charts look but happy to send info to you..Will p.m on Saturday. Keep Safe. Ronald

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Cool, look forward to your P.M. Keep safe to you too!

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Good afternoon to you too Boyce. I will reboot this thread soon. It is important to trade in a systematic way and improvise along the way. Let me know if you need anything

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Yes I admit that this indi probably is unusable when using in a short time frame due to the repaint. You gotta refresh the chart by changing the timeframe back and forth. I have done my best to fix this issue, but i have not been able to. But if you try to apply this indi to an EA or automate this Indi, likely it'll fail miserably. But if you trade manually like I always do, then that should not be a problem. But it's relative to individual, maybe it's too annoying to deal with a repaint indi.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Too long, I don't have time to get to know a system deal, each has its own, the result is green.I wish you good luck.

I wanted to find out if i may come back to you if i wanted to find out more regarding your indicator, thats all? By the way, may i find out why you use shift 3 on moving averages?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Kenyaananize, Thanks for the post! I apologize have not open this thread for quiet long time. I opened another thread with subject ZigCharm. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=673470 It's a reboot of this thread and the tempo is slow Regarding the shift 3, because indicators are a lagging indicator. So I set to shift 3 just for a confirmation however it doesn't mean accuracy. You need to take it carefully.
