Hello Everybody, My name is Blanca from Mexico city I have been a trader since before internet was invented probably, and belonged to this forum since I have memory some already of you know me, and some will start remembering me. Today I am openning this thread as a Tribute to my old dear friend Currencia, who also was my first teacher in this forum, He taught me the basic tools of trading with the slight difference of having the ability to draw and use them the proper way, also gave me the foundations to develop my own style and systems, plus gave me hints of how a good money management technique can improve your trading a lot. "Thank you Curr wherever you are dear friend". So for you all guys with all my heart my GO TO TRADING SYSTEM. I invite you to join me, learn about it. I know you guys just like me share the passion of trading, so lets have some fun together, spread your wings, share your ideas and be kind to each other. Lets learn and have fun as it should be in trading, In the next few days I will be posting the system, rules, plus we will also learn from scratch the basic trading tools every trader should know, until we reach to the point of using management techniques like a boss, lol. Hope to see you guys around and kind regards to you and your families this xmas my fellow traders.

Sound very interesting Blanca. Very excited to wait for you and your trading system out soon. Best regards,

I believe the tools in gone by days like in 2004 and 2006, specially indicators were very good, and forex icons and teachers also helped a lot. Thanks and Regards

I am very willing to communicate with you，and make progress with you，thank you

welcome...hoping to learn one or two things from your experience

--- 帖子 #8 ---
longest piece of clickbait I've ever seen. listen love, you're dealing mostly with men. we don't care about the wrapping paper or the box, wtf is the gift. either tell us the strategy in the first post or gtfo the forum. I'll make it easy for you, fill out this worksheet: 1. The setup is ______________________ 2. The trigger is _____________________ 3. The follow through is ________________ [insert pic of chart]

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Interesting. As a trader you should know what patience means and how to practice it. Instead of telling fellow traders to fill out your sheets.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Welcome guys and thank you very much for your presence here, I will gladly share my experience with you and the system I am about to post works, it is not the holy grail but I hope it wont disappoint you. I also would love to see if we can make it even more powerful together, and everybody is welcomed no matter the experience or lack of it, just be kind, sorry darkmorg but kindness is not one of your qualities. I have my whole life dealed with men at school , at jobs and in trading and always had the chance to receive kindness from them. Goodways100 you are so right, the old school indicators at that time were amazing and guess what? You will see them here again, the system is based in the indicators the older good progammers invented when it was possible to share them instead of keeping them. So lets get this party started guys, see you tomorrow to start, meanwhile WELCOME everybody, if you want to learn and share and have fun in trading this is your place.

Looking forward to this Blanca

Hello Blanca, I hope to learn a lot from you. Thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
ooooohhhhhhhh i hope it'a a swing trading style using d1 timeframe chart

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Sensless thread

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Just thinking out loud. Did you expect Blanca to hand everything over to you on a silver platter? and if so you would be the first one to criticize. Wait and be patient. She will hand out in stages, I am sure. The correct approach in my opinion and the correct way for prospective followers to get used to her approach. Do not judge a book by its cover. Be safe. Cheers

Good morning guys, Lets start by defining how to identify a good system and learn the characteristics you need to look in a good system A good system works in all timeframes A good system works in all instruments A good system does not have to be successful all the time in order to make it profitable but it certainly needs some degree of success A good system can only work for a good trader

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I was waiting for you Wavegarrick, finally a big top guy, thanks a lot, and yes exactly that's it, we will go patiently in each and every stage in order to make this work, just like anything good in life we need to start doing the proper things from the beginning, but also let me mention one quality of a good trader. PATIENCE, Trading is like fishing and you need the patience of a fisherman in this business, other wise you are destined to the ruin, BTW Amando77 You misspelled Senseless, and guess what? in this thread you need to learn to write if you want to learn something so please write properly if you want me to answer you

I hope the thread owner shows this waste of pixel the contempt it deserves. Trot on!

Some information about the system so you can start familiarizing with the content before looking at the charts, and before jumping to rules and entries it is important where a system is coming from and why. The difference between this system and most other systems is that this one is fibonacci based, and this is a very important thing, those who have read about fibonaccis already know how powerful can they be, this is the case in this system, the unique parameters and the right combination of Fibonacci numbers makes a big difference. Iit also has the characteristic of using supports and resistances that move along with the price and time. We all know pivots are an excellent tool for trading but besides using them we will be using some kind of movable and changing supports and resistances The trend is your friend in this system Besides entries and exits we will also use money management techniques to boost its success This evening I will be posting the rules, and templates plus examples of charts, trust me this is not going to be an easy thread for the inexperienced, this is not a set and forget system but you will for sure learn the old school tricks and tips that you no longer see in this forum, see u later guys and Welcome everybody

I look forward to seeing how it works.

Two days (and counting) and still no strategy? Seems a tad silly, no? Maybe next week sometime?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
It will be posted this evening, some of us have real jobs and some should be grateful to receive some experience instead of complanning for their bad luck. This is the last time I will be saying this, if you are not a kind person please do not stay here, there are plenty of rude threads and this is not the place for you, just be clear, its the least you can expect in order to work properly. A small comment, it seems to me that there are many angry people lately in the forum, I don't know if its because they blew their accounts, they do not have a real job or their life simply sucks, but please let the people who wants to learn and have fun do it in an environment of cordiality that is the only rule in this thread, be kind to each other

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes Roberto, This is an indicator based system will be posted soon today , lets hope you find it useful

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Ive seen this thread often, there is nothing coming

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Following always nice to see how another trader views and trades the markets, like trading and patience being the key i sense with this thread too some patience will be well rewarded, gets my vote, if its ok in the future perhaps i might be able to add a few ideas here and there .. if thats fine with the op.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
What ever you think of Blanca's system is irrelevant for you haven't even seen it yet. I know Blanca personally as we corresponded on an almost daily basis as we traded futures together... meaning at the same time while communicating over Skype. I know she is a serious and successful trader and if she is taking the time to share her success with us I think we should pay attention and not judge... especially on something you have no idea about yet. Even if you don't like what is presented...it's a simple matter to just move on. No disparaging comments necessary. Let's at least hear what she has to say and then decide if it's right for you.

Thank you guys, Abraham, Forex Girl Bullilulli and Phillip, and Deanstar welcome you all. My dear Pato such a nice surprise to see you, so many days working together is such a pleasure to see you, if you have time come along dear, Here is a screenshot of the system, this is how it looks like, and before I post the indicators, template and rules, please spend at least 10 mins looking at the chart. Let me explain you what I want you to look for, Think that the market is like a toothpaste and you squeeze it, exactly when you squeeze it all the paste goes out sometimes fast and sometimes slow, this is an oil chart live today and in fact a trade I did today, this explanation about the toothpaste is what we can call a breakout, this is a breakout strategy. It is also a 5 min chart, which means is a small timeframe, we guys are scalping with this timeframe and usually in such a small timeframe there is a lot of noise, so in order to reduce the noise we will be using some filters. You will see two indicators below, the first one is a doublecci and its parameters are 89 and 21, precisely fibonacci numbers, the reason behind this is that for an strange reason, fibonacci numbers usually work and get along very well in the market, and you can apply them to either moving averages, or other indicators and you will be surprised how good they work. You can also see we have pivots, the DP is the daily pivot, DR1 is first resistance, DR2 the second and so on. Let me explain you something about the pivots. Now imagine the market is a car in a highway and that the pivots are the tolls you have to pass and pay the fee in order to either advance if you pay it or to return if you dont pay it. The market has to pass always and all the time through those pivots so you will find that the market is constantly looking for supports and resistances going to a pivot, try to break it or bounce it. That is something we will learn how to handle, is kind of an art too. But also we have trend, in this case there is a yellow line a moving average 240, this divides the buy side from the sell side, I have found 240 closer and even more precise to use it as a trend than other parameters. I mentioned you before there are other kind of supports and resistances that move along with the price and the time, they are called ribbons, they are usually invisible to many traders but this system uses them, we will use them as targets, use them as levels, use them as filters and they are very reliable. It also has heishi candles, to help us keep more in our trade and some moving averages to refine our entry and exit, do not leave pips in the table. This is just the beginning, because in this system even after you manage to dominate the rules, etc you will have to use money management techniques in order to improve its success and the winning and accumulation of pips, because at the end this is a business and pips and the increase of the account is our goal. So please take a good look at this screenshot. In the next post i will put the indicators, template and rules.

Thanks for your contribution

I can tell just by looking at the sample that it has alot of potential to knock out alot of "noise" Great job Blanca...subscribed!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
interesting... subscribed..like you mentioned it look like old school system.. like to know much about fibonacci and numbers

Hi! I'm neebie here and I feel me newbie at trading, thought I've studied and trained it three and half years. Thats why I'm waiting impatiently Blancas next script. I really love this forum after following it some months. Sorry my bad english. Regards Ilboy from Finland

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Cool guys, Kaiser, Vigiragavan, I knew, I knew you old school guys would recognize and you guys indeed have a trained eye, thank you very much for your presence, I will do my best thank you Merka, now next post will include, indicators, template and rules.

Quoting tenthman Two days (and counting) and still no strategy? Seems a tad silly, no? Maybe next week sometime? Why are you so angry?? What did I say that caused the vitriol? Sheesh ... I think I'm going to look for a friendlier thread.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thank you Ilboy welcome, I hope you find useful Finland boy, and Tenthman you don't have to go if you don't want to, what would happen if you leave the chance of learning something good and useful, maybe even profitable, you never know. So lets work guys and kind regards

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I look forward to learning what I can from you. I am sure I will be the limiting factor.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
To make this thread work for some time to come, we need to give blanca all the encouragement she needs and not create a wound and rub salt into it. Only 2 days and people are in a hurry to want to know everything about the system. In a hurry to run before knowing how to crawl. She has her own life to live, not to be enslaved by those immediate demands of this thread and we do not know anything much about her other life situations. All she needs to do is to come into the thread once a day to explain her system and answer questions after her trading is done and priorities in life are taken care of.

Hello Mam, can this method be use on a D1 chart? if so, should the parameter seting must be change? i am a swing trader using 1D chart only because i still have to go to work so i can't watch the chart to often or my boss will kick my *ss XD but overall i want to say thank you Mam for willing to share your trading strategy

--- 帖子 #43 ---
interesting.thank you blanca.i am a scalper too

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Great post blanca, I myself work with scalps, Dow jones and other index and commodities, Dont mind those rude people. Its already a mean and evil world might as well kill them with kindness.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Blanca, congratulations on your new thread! What a surprise! That's more than 10 years back since we traded with some basics from your current strategy! The Ribbons, the DoubleCCI with those settings! I remember the thread and you and me being around there. Good to see you developed the system further and built your skills. Interested! Wish you a lot of success and fun!

This thread is turning into a lovely surprise, Jazz for god sake 10 years, and we still up and running lol. Thank you so much Inthebox, very sensitive, Shiva, an honour to have you here I have heard very good things about you, and Samualkanu, Markstep and wealthpro thank you so much. Tabary the answer is yes it can be applied to 1day, in fact the bigger the less noise you will find, but remember you might need a bigger size of account to trade it. I remember myself at the office switching my screen fast when my boss was near,lol trying to look at the dow jones lol. Also remember guys that a good system has to work in all timeframes and in all instruments too. Babygator your presence here will make this thread break all the barriers lets turn you from baby to big gator during this process. See u in the morning guys thank you so much and welcome you all.

Hi Blanca, Thank you for starting this thread. I have been trading for about 2.5 years and still trying to be consistent in reaping those pips. I am sure I will learn from this thread and from all who contribute positively here. Wishing everyone Merry X'mas and green pips in 2020.

Indicators part one, seems its the maximum per post so I will divide them in several posts and the template guys

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Indicators part 2 and Template, These are in mt4 I have seen that the ribbons sometimes do not appear completely in some metatraders and in others they do, so please tell me if you have any problems,

--- 帖子 #57 ---
add it to the zip file and share here.. that might be useful..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
wow that is a heavy duty system you have there Blanca now this really could be fun. Thankyou. What i like is that your reasoning to follow the system is going to be superb you know how you like to trade and why which is rare around here. Nice one.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
@blanca Thanks for your indicators but I will suggest you to do as follow: Add everything in a compressed zip folder and share it on your first post even future updates otherwise it will just get lost when your thread becomes bigger and bigger.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
It should look like this, it is CADJPY chart today 5 mins, a breakout signal today. We will try to make the trades realtime or the closes to realtime, I will start by posting them and then you will post them too, we will make a record of how good it works,before that I will train you guys in the things to look for not only in this system but in trading in general, like supports, formations, last highs and last lows, trends , divergences, how to use money management techniques to maximize not only this system but any system you use from now on.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
T3MA did not work, because of this kino did not work. Fixed

--- 帖子 #62 ---
It's a system by combination of some lagging indicator which is work only trend market but in consolidation period it's below your account

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Dear Emir, it is a trend indicator but guess what? We are going to filter the noise that usually kills the systems during consolidation, look closely at the charts I have posted, to the trained eye you will be able to see it filters the market and you can see clean and clear entries. After I teach you how to use the ribbons which I am sure you have never seen them, you will tell me what you think, I have not posted the rules yet, just wait and see.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Zipped

--- 帖子 #65 ---
many thanks. now the template is same as blanca

--- 帖子 #66 ---
waiting patiently ( rather impatiently ) for the rules .

--- 帖子 #67 ---
It is indeed a heavy duty system Dean, it is rare too, hope you guys enjoy it and find it useful in your trading life, as it developes we will be learning from drawing properly a trend line, looking for breakouts, defining targets, analysis. Thank you for zipping the indicators Jereali very kind of you guys. Now in the next posts I will be writing the rules , in this case we will use a system but we will also learn how to trade, we will remember the basics but also we will have to develop better and more advanced skills, in order to achieve that, we will work together everyday and share our thoughts. The idea is no matter what system you use or design you will have the strong skills any trader should own in order to succeed in this business, if we manage to make them strong from the very beginning the rest is going to be easy for you, see you later guys .

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thank you blanca, I will follow your system and your explanations very carefully

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hello Mam, this is how it look on xau/aud on daily timeframe, i think the pivot is they are up close together, is this normal? Also the t3ma ribbon is way bellow is this normal?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Guys, Same chart as Blanca posted, CadJpy on the 5 min time frame. I believe our charts look the same. Thanks Jereajali for the Zip file and more so thanks Blanca. Following with interest. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
first post .... whoohoo @blanca could you make a short youtube vid to explain how this works? looks very interesting

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Really good idea. If Blanca have time to do that. And thousands of thanks to Blanca and to 'zip-maker'.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks for the system 1. I will be back in 6 months time to read all over 2. Waiting for the YouTube video 3. Merry Christmas and happy pips

--- 帖子 #74 ---
pivot settings is for lower timeframes not to be used with daily chart.. switch to m5 or m15 or h1..

--- 帖子 #75 ---
so if i trade 1D chart, i just have to remove the pivot indicator?

--- 帖子 #76 ---

Hello Blanca, I am much in for your trading strategy. I can't just wait to get to understanding the oldies tricks and tips of trading(like u indicated) and may be it's just high time for me to getting professional . I kindly await the strategy rules.A big Thanks(from Nigeria).

--- 帖子 #82 ---
You need to open the pivot indicator, turn off the daily SR levels and enable the Weekly/Monthly ones as needed.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Sub'd looking forward to seeing a new system GL

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hey Blanca, I am grateful to be part of this new system you are introducing. I am new to Forex but hungry to learn. Certainly, if you would explain your system in beginners terms, it would really help out a lot of us that are new to the game. I have managed to install the indicators as instructed. Below is a screenshot of what my 5 Minute Time Frame looks like. Cheers !

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hii ,, Thanks Blanca for your system , Subiscribe would you agree with EurGBP ,, it's a short trade ?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I did not get it same Also, does anyone experience heavy slowdown in mt4? Thanks for sharing Bianca

--- 帖子 #87 ---
If your system is not looking the same, then refer to post 61 and replace the indicator with the fixed one. I also get a slow down when loading the chart - lots of indicators I think....

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thanks will try...for me it is so slow that it gets completely untradable

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I find once it's loaded it's fine, but I do get quite a bit of, "not responding", while opening MT4. I think I trade in a similar way, but I'm not going to jump the gun on Blanca... If I'm right then I have a much lighter system that I could share with Blanca's permission, but as I say I'd rather let her explain her method. I'm sure we all can learn something.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Do you know when the explanation of the method will start?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Maybe it helps you guys if you limit - number of charts open - number of bars in history and on chart, max to 5000 (go to Tools / Options / Charts) - overall CPU usage

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thank you Blanca. Subscribed. _________________________________________ To avoid CPU issues until we get the system details, I've opened all my chosen charts on a separate MT4 with just the CCI filter, with alerts on. See pic. On the other "trading" MT4 I have just a few charts with Blanca's template open to verify the signals

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Good topic, post indicators and do not show with enter or put TP and STOP LOSS? I have seen a lot of topics, but I don't see anyone saying, nor showing their "real" gains with the strategy or earnings history .. I only see promises ... however I am curious if this topic will just be one more like the others, or will show something that we have never seen before in this forum ... I will follow, good initiative blanca hope it makes it different from all other topics. *Blanca ativity on others topics using diferent TLP and methods diferrent I really hope she brings something different and shows her real earnings history .. because in the topics she has started before and even answered topics, she shows different setups different techniques .... well is already the second strategy topic she opens ... I want to see if it really shows something that surprises me and the members! Good luck blanca ... wish you good luck! : https://www.forexfactory.com/search....rchid=23045862 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=596717 hug from Portugal Ricardo

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi guys good morning, Here the rules and some explanations about why I use these indicators I am also posting this chart today First the list of indicators I am using and why, The system is formed basicly by Kino Ribbons Moving averages Double CCI Filter CCI Pivots RIBBONS It is a follow trend system but with the use of ribbons we will be able to see invisible supports and resistances that will appear as the market is moving real time, the ribbons not only show us those levels but also will show us if those levels are weak or strong, the ribbons will also show us the market movements with more clarity. The market moves in waves or cycles so we will be able to see how the price will be waving from one support to resistance, we will be able to see where exactly is the price even during congestion or rest, so even for those with a different approach to the market will be able to see what its doing while not during trend. We have different sizes of ribbons, they are translated in timeframes from smaller to bigger but also they mean that when they all agree the traders of those different timeframes also agree, and then a highly profitable trade occur. What we are looking at this point is SPACE, empty space guys. The ribbons will help us filter the best trades, you will be able to see that when we have space, the price flies. so Filter is key. Also we will be trading inside the ribbons from extreme to extreme, usually in the cases the ribbons are big and open, we will be using them as targets too, or walls in case our entry is too near of a strong one, we will also be able to introduce ourselves in some of them like in todays trade, eurjpy 5mins chart. I know they are heavy, try to use only one or two charts and the less history in your charts you can. I am sure that during the process you will be able to find even more uses to the ribbons. MOVING AVERAGES I chose to use the 240 moving average as a trend indicator, I have found that this parameter is closer to the price than the most used 200 moving average A 7 moving average , it helps a lot during fast big moves like news, will help us see a fast exit or a better exit by not leaving pips on the table. PIVOTS There are many kinds of pivots, these are ones I find suitable and reliable, they start with the Daily pivot which divides the buy side from the sell side, the market looks for those levels to find support and resistance, but if you have had any experience with them you already know that sometimes they are not enough to trade in a profitable way, so in combination with ribbons we will be able to see those invisible levels where the market can reach, bounce or break. DOUBLE CCI The double CCI will give us two things, will filter us the trend and give us the strength of the movement, I have added a level of 200, in both sides so when the Double CCI crosses that level a signal is triggered, that is why I drew the red vertical line to show the entry. Targets and stoplosses are not fixed, because the market is not a fixed thing, we will be looking at each trade carefully and doing a pre analysis even if its fast of each and every one, we will try to look for the lowest risk and higher profitability, like the one I am showing you today in eurjpy. The targets will depend of each trade, lets take this chart as an example, the target is the other extreme of the ribbon and see how exactly there the price arrives making this trade a 1 to 3 risk reward, but also if you look at your charts after this you will be able to see that the price also touches the DS2 pivot so its your choice. The stoploss, T here are many ways to place a stoploss, even in some systems a fixed stoploss is good if its suitable for its purpose, In this system the stoploss will be placed in several ways,: Use the last recent high or last recent low A pivot A ribbon the 240 moving average. We will be choosing which one is the most suitable at the moment for each trade. The one that for example is nearer or smaller stoploss or more reasonable or convenient. In this trade in eurjpy I chose the 240 moving average which is the yellow line, but also imagine I had chosen to place my stoploss in the last recent high, it also agrees with the DR1 pivot and agrees with the extreme of the ribbon too. So we will be able to find the most suitable stoploss for the current trade, and there is something we need to consider too guys. The trailing of the stoploss In this eurjpy trade today I used a ribbon to move and trail my stoploss, look at the second ribbon the one with the green bars following from a certain distance the market and let it them breath at the same time. this is a way to let your trade run and keep it open meanwhile you are stress free. Each and every trade is different so we will also give each trade a different treatment FILTER CCI The filter cci will help us filter the strong moves of the double cci, look when it changes the colour of the bars the market keeps steady and strong so its like a confirmation that what we are doing is correct.

Hi Guys, Just a tip for users and more specifically new traders. Using multiple charts on smaller time frame require you to have history down loaded on your charts. If you don't have enough history it will lead to your chart or computer freezing up and indicators not displaying correctly, if you open a chart template with many indicators. Ensure you open your pair that you want to trade on your default (Chart) template setting, from the monthly down to the 1 minute time frame to force feed historical data, before attaching Blanca's template which has many indicators for the specific pair that you want to trade. There are history down load scripts as well to make your life easier. Mt4 is like a car. It needs oil for the engine to run smoothly. Cheers.

What is the matter of stop loss and take profit? thank you!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
@blanca What are the rules of your system? Your previous post is a description of indicators but when exactly you enter/exit? Thanks

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Blanca is adding explanations to post #94

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Basic Rules of entry and exit 1.- Look the 240 sma find if the trend is bullish of bearish Buy signal above the 240 sma Sell signal below the 240 sma 2.- The double cci 89 and 21 are a combination of Fibonacci numbers, one is longer than the other, when both agree in the indicator appears volume in red or green. When this volume reaches the 200 levels above is a buy signal, when it reaches the -200 level is a sell signal. Also the yellow line has to either cross or at least touch the 200 level. 3.- For a buy signal the price should be above the Daily Pivot 4.- For a sell signal the price should be below the Daily pivot 5,- The cci filter changes of colour in the bars, if its a buy signal will turn light green and if its a sell signal will turn light red. The ribbons will need a separate explanation but basicly the best signals occur when the price isi outside of them like in these two examples below. GBPCHF 5mins today, A buy signal that is triggered exactly above the 240 sma and also above the daily pivot our target is the next pivot the DR1 The second signal a sell signal is the perfect example why all trades are different, Inn this casse the signal also is triggered when the price goes out of the ribbons, below the 240 sma and below the DS1 pivot, showing us the entry, but the price as soon as it reaches DS2 bounces back looking for resistance in the previous support that now turns into a resistance., we can either hit our first target in DS2 and go out or stay and keep until the end of the trend and close in DS3, here the skills of the trader play a good part. In either decisions the results are good and profitable.

@blanca How you define bullish bearish trend using SMA 240? Is it above SMA 240 bullish? Below SMA 240 bearish?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi guys, I hope you are having a great morning today, I am posting the rules and explanations but would like to stop and answer some questions I have seen you guys posted overnight. First welcome everybody, lets trade together and have fun and if you can learn something then lets be it, try to relax and imagine you are watching a movie. This is a system that works with some effort and experience, but the Holy Grail is in yourselves guys. I remember myself looking everywhere for the magic indicator and until now that indicator does not exist at least not that I know, lol. But what do exist is knowledge and on our way we will also be developing some personal skills a trader needs like patience, self criticizing, and I found that instead of buying systems or robots that usually are expensive the answer was in the books. Amazing books like Candlesticks from Steve Nison, Trading in the Zone, Reminiscense of a trader, etc they suddenly started giving me answers plus the people in this forum sharing good stuff. Let me asnswer some questions, The system works in all timeframes including daily but the pivots are for smaller timeframes so try to use a smaller timeframe so you can learn how to use them as they are important for your trading life dear. Derek, any contribution is welcomed, the ribbons gives the system a depth sentiment of the market but anything you feel can contribute is welcome. Marka the 240 sma will be used to divide the buys from the sells and anything above that yellow line is going to be a buy signal and bellow a bearish signal, also the pivots are used for the same purpose, Ricardo you are so welcomed to be here, I used to be in Lisbon and in El Faro for a long time, your country is absolutely lovely, and the food exquisite. Lets work together guys and have a lot of fun, because trading has to be fun too, otherwise we would not be here. My experience will try to guide you guys to achieve that same experience, but we all know this forum is full of very smart people and I am counting on them to participate, to share like in the old times of this forum, and change our trading lives forever. Ok let me keep posting the rules see u later guys , welcome everybody and enjoy.

[quote=blanca;12670625]Hi guys good morning, Here the rules and some explanations about why I use these indicators I am also posting this chart today First the list of indicators I am using and why, The system is formed basicly by Kino Ribbons Moving averages Double CCI Filter CCI Pivots RIBBONS It is a follow trend system but with the use of ribbons we will be able to see invisible supports and resistances that will appear as the market is moving real time, the ribbons not only show us those levels but also will show us if those levels are weak or strong, the ribbons will also show us the market movements with more clarity. The market moves in waves or cycles so we will be able to see how the price will be waving from one support to resistance, we will be able to see where exactly is the price even during congestion or rest, so even for those with a different approach to the market will be able to see what its doing while not during trend. We have different sizes of ribbons, they are translated in timeframes from smaller to bigger but also they mean that when they all agree the traders of those different timeframes also agree, and then a highly profitable trade occur. What we are looking at this point is SPACE, empty space guys. The ribbons will help us filter the best trades, you will be able to see that when we have space, the price flies. so Filter is key. Also we will be trading inside the ribbons from extreme to extreme, usually in the cases the ribbons are big and open, we will be using them as targets too, or walls in case our entry is too near of a strong one, we will also be able to introduce ourselves in some of them like in todays trade, eurjpy 5mins chart. I know they are heavy, try to use only one or two charts and the less history in your charts you can. I am sure that during the process you will be able to find even more uses to the ribbons. MOVING AVERAGES I chose to use the 240 moving average as a trend indicator, I have found that this parameter is closer to the price than the most used 200 moving average A 7 moving average , it helps a lot during fast big moves like news, will help us see a fast exit or a better exit by not leaving pips on the table. PIVOTS There are many kinds of pivots, these are ones I find suitable and reliable, they start with the Daily pivot which divides the buy side from the sell side, the market looks for those levels to find support and resistance, but if you have had any experience with them you already know that sometimes they are not enough to trade in a profitable way, so in combination with ribbons we will be able to see those invisible levels where the market can reach, bounce or break. DOUBLE CCI The double CCI will give us two things, will filter us the trend and give us the strength of the movement, Blanca...is that a 7 ema or sma?

Hello people. I can't load setup correctly. Can anyone share the instructions to install the indicators please

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I'm a newbie trader and I'm using MT4. Sorry to ask but how do I load the indicators of Blanca on my MT4 account? Thanks in advance to anyone who will answer.

Hi Blanca, thank you for taking time out of your busy day to bring us this system. Below is a sell i just took, wanted to confirm the validity of it? thank you

Hey Guys, I am very new to trading. I have tried loading Bianca's indicators as well as the template she provided. I am testing with the EURUSD pair. I have been able to get alerts(BUY/SELL/CRITICAL) , although I do not know why my charts look a little different than everyone's that is doing it right. Below are screenshots of what I believe are my settings. Am I doing something wrong? I am using MT4(Hugo's Way MetaTrader 4 Terminal) Any and all help would be appreciated. I have installed all indicators to the correct directory (MQL4\Indicators\Blanca Strategy) The last folder is where my indicators are placed. I see them in my Navigator Window. When I was to add them to the chart, I right click on each indicator and click "Attach to a chart". THANKS GUYS !! Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Indicators should go to MQL4\Indicators. No need to create any further folder. So let move all indicators in folder \Blanca Strategy to MQL4\Indicators then reload the Template. That's all.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
J3rryP..open with template (tpl file) to get correct setting

--- 帖子 #118 ---
[quote=kaiser soze;12671416] haha .......... you will know, only if you load just the template.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi guys, Welcome you all, glad you are already having fun you certainly sound interested. Seems the problem to see the ribbons was the T3MA and someone fixed it. I will remove the bad one and replace it with the good one so we all have the same charts. It is a 7 simple moving average applied to high. gf23 it is correct, bigpin it is correct too. I have written the basic entry rules but we still need the advanced entry rules, but don't worry those rules are something I do as a routine and will teach you guys how to use them, they will help us filter the best trades. Have a lovely night guys and enjoy your life as a traders, you are already very lucky to be in this forum.

THANK YOUUUU IT WORKS NOW .. I'm Really EXCITED NOW ! Nice to meet you all wonderful peeps. Thanks @ blanca for sharing ...

Hello! It seems to me that there are too many indicators on the chart, some of them duplicate each other. I propose to combine MA240 and CCI in one indicator. I wrote a simple indicator that colors candlesticks according to the following rules: if MA240 below Close trend up and color DodgerBlue. If MA240 is below Close and CCI is above 200 signal buy and color Lime. If MA240 Close above the down trend and color of Tomato. If MA240 above and Close below the 200 CCI sell signal and the color Red. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hy... is arrow on your chart manually drawed or you have a kind of automatic signal? In that case 'd like to know how to set it up... Thanks Best regards

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi, Not saying it wont work, but you are buying below daily pivot

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Blanca and all on this thread. Here is an indicator that draws an arrow when a calculation that appears to me to be quite similar to the CCI, reaches a specified level. In the charts below I have set these levels to 150 and -150, but there are lots of settings that users can tweak. I in no way wish to adjust Blanca's template, but thought it might be useful to some and otherwise just thought provoking.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I think CCI Filter is doing this job very well already, look at its bars in Lime and Red that help us to see possible setups in an easier way for us. In the picture the Trend Scalp dot in Pink does not match with the Sell setup according to Blanca strategy (between 12:30 and 15:30). Then you have to go to find a matching setting Trend Scalp for the strategy I think it is not worth.

no indi just manual drawn yes buying below DP, but above daily open. Turned out DP was target.... but I did not close the trade so now some pips against me but maybe it was a bad trade

I just closed my trade for 20 pips, don't want to be screwed by GBP vote.... Could have my TP earlier, if I had taken my profit at 1st hit DP it would have been a good trade. But i did not take my profit and price went back. Nice to see MA 240 became support and price sayed above Daily open. That was the reason to keep the trade open. Thnx Blanca for this set-up. It is a valuble add-on for me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi guys, Good morning and thank you so much for your interest, I see already some of you are working with it and got it right. I love all your contributions and I was not expecting less from you guys, as I told you the system throws many signals and you are already looking at them, there are also advanced rules for entry in order to pick the best signals we can get, and will be posting them but also those rules we will be applying them trade after trade, krakof if you have any doubt message me in Spanish and gladly will answer everything you need. Let me show you todays trade , it is the EURAUD 5 mins, please look how a breakout appears when the price is out of the ribbons and also breaks the pivot, the first target was DS2 which is broken and then returns to look for resistance and kiss good bye the ribbon and DS2 to keep its way down now looking for next target ds3. If someone could make an alert for these more advanced rules would be awesome, that would make us spend less time watching charts and grab better trades, so far I look for them every day but lets keep on working and I am sure we will get many good things, enjoy your day guys. We also have to speak about news and fundamentals and how we will be using them to trade.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
No trade. After the fact vertical line.

Would I be right if I said this was a BUY SIGNAL? Stop Loss: 109.316 My Entry Point( When I looked at the chart): 109.409 Take Profit: 109.629 ( DR1 ) Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #140 ---
all signals at correct timing hit profit, looks great system by a great personality. Thanks Blanca

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Good morning blanca, Can you post picture of ribbon settings? I cant load the template. So I need to install them one by one. thank you!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi guys, Glad you are already looking at the signals, I ill try to post them as real time as I can and you already are looking at them realtime, the usdjpy entry is great just your target could be shorter, place your target at the extreme of the ribbon, that is an obstacle before it goes to the pivot, that is why the ones outside the ribbons work better but as you can see also inside the ribbons is possible to trade. I need to write about the ribbons too, the parameters one by one , the idea is that you know the system and its parts deeply and why I chose them, how to use them, they are a big part of the system, just let me finish my trade I am trading this system too, lol. Enjoy this Friday morning guys and see u in a while

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hello again Blanca, I see your system has advanced a great deal and I congratulate your final product. It appear your trading has also advanced as well. I would like to just take this time to congratulate you on your continued success and hope we can meet up and talk sometime when you have time. My skype address is still the same so when you have a moment send a message. I know you are busy and hope things are working out well. Like everything I've come to learn about you, your business has persevered and appears to be thriving. I will continue to "lurk" on your thread and follow your progress in your career with great envy. I wish you a very happy and safe holiday season and all the best in the new year to come.

Just one question.... i've read that the system is quite good for any timeframe but.... for ex looking at EURAUD 1H TF have same entry criteria? I mean if we have to wait 200 for ribbon seems quite late Same value for every tf? Thanks Regards Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #148 ---
If I may? When the pivot is on the higher timeframe like 1Hr and 4Hr, your daily pivot is very tight. Basically you don't have to much room to play this strategy. I would recommend using 5min or 15 min timeframe for this strategy. The pivot is better positioned. Also, if you want to use 1Hr timeframe, use the weekly pivot and for the 4Hr timeframe use the monthly pivot. This strategy works best in lower timeframes for scalping. @Blanca: Hope I did not jump into your boat. Regards. D.

Great job Longerer...many thanks!! And joyous holidays!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Guys, Nice to see you SK, Don Pato could you please send me a private message with your email and skype so we can get in contact my dear friend, would be lovely to see you again. welcome dreadlocks, Cescof yes indeed it might look like too far but what I do is that sometimes in 1hr timeframe as it is developing the signal even before the hour ends you can get a very good price, we will do some in 1 hr so you can practice my friend. Dirk you are welcome to help with whatever you want and in fact your opinion is correct, for higher timeframes the best are the weekly and monthly pivots. Longerer thank you for adding the indicators if you feel better as long as the result is the same its fine by me. Thank you very much for your contribution, that is the idea, to make this system faster, better, stronger and not only the system but ourselves we will be better traders with the help of everyone.. Joyeous Holidays Kaiser for you too. See u tomorrow guys.

Hey Blanca, i have a question regarding your entry's. On the CCI, when all other conditions are right, do you trigger the trade when the 21 or the 89 or both CCI's hit the 200? Thx D.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hey thanks a lot jazz, appreciate it!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
What about CCI filter? Interesting strategy...I usually sell when CCI is above 200 level.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
@ ionut_blue I believe her strategy works a bit different in that, we BUY when Double CCI(Yellow Line) is above 200 level and we SELL when it is below -200. Looking at the history of any chart, I've seen that it does match with correct signals. The only cases where there are false signals, are when we don't look at the other criteria to match up with Double CCI. For example, in the CADJPY chart below, there was a signal to BUY when CCI crossed 200 level(Where the Red horizontal line is). The CCI filter changed to light green. Price @ Entry went from about 83.254 to the R1_Line around 83.611. This all happened within 4-6 hours. This is a good marginal increase and we would pick up quite a lot of Pips using this strategy. As long as there is good risk management, this strategy should have your account growing in no time.

Hola Blanca, Thank you for sharing this system and your knowledge. You have a peaceful and warm attitude which is great to create a positive atmosphere in the thread. I hope you have enough patience to carry on with this project. Meanwhile I have a question regarding the entry setup. It seems the CCI rules are somewhat flexible and I'm not sure if that's the case or I didn't understand the rules correctly. You said the CCI green/red bars must reach the 200 level and also the yellow line must reach the 200 level. But in this EURAUD trade only the yellow line reaches the 200 level. In other trades it seems the CCI is ready but the trade is delayed a few bars. Thanks, Jaime

Hi guys, Hope you are having great days before xmas, I still need to write some rules about the ribbons, they represent different or multiple timeframes plus they are also invisible supports and resistances that move along with the price. Tomorrow iwill be posting them with an image of how a perfect setup looks like, usually when this happens the signal impulse is very good. I believe that when you upload the indicators and the ribbons do not appear its because the t3ma but it was fixed already, please message me if you keep having troubles. I have used the system in 4hr, 1hr 5 mins so the cci parameter works fine, not sure if in daily timeframe another settings would be better but feel free to try it. see u tomorrow and have a lovely night guys and Saludos Colombia

Just for the "newbies" to Mt4, after you installed the "Template" you noticed that the price line is missing..., how to fix it? a.- Right click on the chart b.; Left click on properties {all the way down) c.; On grid, choose your color d.; Also check that little window to see if your other colors are right (like mine,or?}, after that, click OK e.; Now you noticed the "grid' all over, Right click again over the chart, select and click "grid', its gone... I was a MT4 newbie, and I know that a simple thing can be a pain in the a.. to fix it. 1. Price line 2.Grid color 3. Line graph Attached Image (click to enlarge)

No, just after you installed the indicators in the indicators folders, closed Metatrader-twice-(close-open-close-open}, you apply the template , that's it,,,the KinoT3TM goes only once in the Indies folder, the template will make the 5 copies with all the individual settings. The settings are if for any reason the template can't be installed?.. you must install the Kino separately 5 times (on your chart,NO in the Indies folder},and then apply each setting correspondingly to each Kino.

Merry xmas Everyone, Hope you are enjoying today is xmas and tomorrow we will receive gifts from Santa. Let me give you a small gift today guys, in my system there is a perfect setup that based on hours of observation of the charts I found it works in a very reliable way, Also the next post will contain a screenshot of the ribbons one by one, how I use them but there are many other uses too, that we will find together. Thank you for all the indicators, I am sure the zz semafor will help us a lot to find the breakouts. So once I finish posting the whole system we will all start trading it adding it a few money management techniques, as some already have seen the system works wonderfully even during rest or congestion because of the ribbons we can clearly see the market, now with the zz semafor as one of you guys posted everything can bee seen clearer. Happy Holidays and Merry xmas to you all, XOXO Blanca

Merry Christmas Blanca... Looking forward to your posts...

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi guys, This is the perfect set up or pattern I was talking about. What we have to look for is.- 1.-Breakout 2.-Space ( The price outside the ribbons or enough space between the ribbons) 3.-Trend ( The price below or above 240 sma and below or above Daily pivot) 4.- Double CCI crossing the 200 level but also 5.- Look at the yellow line in the Double CCI indicator, for some reason when this line which is a 21 sma by the time a signal appears and if that yellow line is vertical or almost vertical, then usually a strong impulse is followed by it.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thank you Blanca. I believe the yellow line is the 21 "entry" cci and the 30 SMA would be the black line? But yes always better when yellow leads strongly. It's a good example.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Yes let me correct that, Thank you Backspin. Also the black line is useful for an early exit. Aaven, dreadlocks ameint, myprofit, welcome to this thread and feel free to share your knowledge guys.

@Blanca, great looking system, just finished reading through all the posts here and can see good contribution by everyone. May I suggest that to keep things in perspective, please keep the most current set of indicators in Post #1 so it's easy to find always rather than having to search and that way its officially what the system is to maintain its integrity. Members make valuable contributions and when Blanca has confirmed that they add value to the system, she can add those indicators or rules to Post#1 so everyone can find the most current version there. May I also suggest to the users to keep the colors consistent with what Blanca is using so we are all on the same page and all out charts look the same, that's my two cents. Kudos Blanca

Hi Blanca, Subscribed. As I am a D1 Trader with Price Action without indicators I will give it a try. That is not common that someone share his or her system for free. You are right what you wrote a system is only good like the trader who use it correctly. Happy christmas Hoschie

--- 帖子 #200 ---
hi Blanca, thank you for sharing free trading system.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Good morning guys, Its been a busy morning, and the system also had some good signals, this is just one of it I am sure you guys have taken your own and if you are so kind of posting them would be awesome for everfybody to learn, digiff you got it at the first time, lol I am surprised man. I will for publish the system in the post number 1 so its easy to find for everybody. Now the ribbons.- These are the ribbons and they are multi timeframe, it means we will be able to see the current timeframe which is the ribbon closer to the price, it is a 5mins for say something. Then the bigger timeframes, 30mins, 1 hr and 4 hrs There are several purposes of how we can use them, if you look at them closely just the ribbons and the price you will be able to spot the waves or moves the market does, you will be able to see how the price looks for supports and resistences among the ribbons, like Tarzan jumping from one tree to the other. It can either rest and look for another one or it can break it, depending on the strength of the movement. Rules to trade them= The ribbons when they are open, the price can pass through them easily, but when they are closed or narrow they turn into very strong levels of supports or resistances, in the example below, please look at the 1hr ribbons Look how the ribbon looks as flat almost as a needle and look how strong takes the market up, like surfing, like if the market were on a surfing board it goes steady up. When the ribbons are open, sometimes are easier to pass through, not always but lets say there is a bigger chance, but it is safe to trade inside a ribbon if its open.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Second part of the ribbons.- The ribbons can also be used to place the stoploss and the targets, Look at this one, I have placed the stoploss under the 30sma, it agrees with the 1 hrs too, if I were inside a ribbon it would be reasonable to place the stoploss at the beginning of the ribbon and the target at the other extreme of the ribbon, I will show you more examples of that later. There are several kinds of profitable trades. based on the inclination, this is a 45 degrees trade, you can use the 5mins ribbon to exit, see how in this trade the ribbon is always profitable and keeps above the ribbon the ribbon even looks red, but when the price crosses back and the ribbon turns red its time to close in a subtle way, you do not leave pips on the table like this. For the profitable trade with a 90 degrees we ill use another method, as those kind of moves are common during the news, the movement can jump fast and even sometimes go back fast, leaving us with almost zero profit so there are ways to grab some pips in those cases. I would say that the Trend is your friend but the ribbons are your friends too, lol. Next The Pivots.-

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hello tuxTrader, if it is possible to move the horizontal lines one or two places to the right , sometimes they are to close to the "action".... Attached Image

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Just as I was reading your notes Blanca, I notice my trade was bouncing off the lower ribbon and decided to get out as the support was strong. Thank you again for this wonderful system, looking forward to the money management portion along with everything else.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
So cool Bigpipin1, seems you got the tip just on time,lol. Nice to see the things we are learning you are already using them in your favour, kind regards and welcome guys, Still missing the pivots then we define the strategy to start and then at the end the money management techniques. Enjoy your evening guys. XOXO

Hi guys, would anyone help me how to make my charts looks the same as blanca ?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
A very good colouring combinations for the system. Do you mind if you share your template. Thanks

Post 55 &amp; 56

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I enter the 15-minute chart, at 11.35 pm with a purchase. The price goes in my favor, but on the next candle a setback begins, it is here that I go to a 5-minute chart, to wait for a re-entry in purchase when all conditions are met. If this happens, I will write a graphic of the reentry later.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hello Krakof, with all due respect, you should have entered on the 5 min chart and not the 15 min chart. Enter on the 5 min chart and use the 15min chart to check if the direction of the short term trend if it is the same. Basically, the best time to enter, would have been where you have your stoploss. Just my opinion. D.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Well, I have gone down to 1 minute, and when the conditions have been met I have returned to re-enter with a purchase, now to wait for it to reach my TP. Anyway I do not expect a great development, since it is Friday.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
[quote = DirkH143; 12678158] {quote} Hola Krakof, con el debido respeto, debería haber ingresado en el gráfico de 5 minutos y no en el gráfico de 15 minutos. Ingrese en el gráfico de 5 minutos y use el gráfico de 15 minutos para verificar si la dirección de la tendencia a corto plazo es la misma. Básicamente, el mejor momento para ingresar habría sido donde tiene su stoploss. Solo es mi opinión. D. [/ Cita] All the reason for you. The problem is that I missed that first entry. I entered the second entry given by the system. It is not always in front of the computer, and less is these dates. By the way, Merry Christmas to all, and a prosperous 2020

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Would you like to share the template, please...?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Good morning guys, So nice to see you are already working, Krakof Let me put the same chart to explain what you did, ok? This is the 5 min chart and you can see the entry in the red vertical line, just when the price crosses the DR1 pivot, the target is easy, DR2 pivot is your target even using a 15mins timeframe, in this system just like in any other it is very important the entry price, it determines the stoploss and the target, and at the same time you will be able to plan if your trade is going to be a 1 to 1 risk reward a 1 to 2 risk reward like in this case or 1 to 3. Maybe you got in late which in that case is preferable not to take the trade and wait for another, they appear lots and lots during the day, reentries are not possible dear they only show you lost your way and lost your plan or maybe you never had a plan. One should always stick to your plan, even if its a small trade we need to do an small analysis even if its fast, let me show you how guys: a) First we see the signal, b) We determine if its a buy or sell signal c)We look for the best stoploss to place, for that we have to look for levels near our entry, could be a pivot level like in this case, could be a ribbon, or your last high recent low or high d )Ok now you know where your stoploss is placed, you have to look for a target, and this is very important dear traders. Always before entering a trade we need to have a Target A good trader always knows where to go before entering, always has a target, e) The target again could be a Pivot, a last recent high or low, the extreme of a ribbon, or in some cases when we do not have anything but empty space we will use fibonnacci to determine our exit.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi Blanca, why is the buy tirggered at DR1 when the CCI has not reached level 200 yet? Regards and thanks for all

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Blanca, Using the trade Krakof made as an example, can you please clarify the CCI rules to trigger a trade? I'm a bit confused about the exact rules. In the CCI tab I see 4 indicators, a yellow line, a light brown line, a black line and red/green bars. Which of those must touch the 200 line? Thank you

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Krakof you are doing an excellent job, trading is not easy at all, just need some refinement so, Let me guide you first by talking about Pivots. Welcome Beren and Jmmac, yes we will be doing so many trades that you will learn for your whole life this system don't worry guys soon you will be able to see the pattern yourselves. Jmmac is the yellow line, the 21 sma that has to touch the 200 level. Beren look at the breakout with the signal triggered at the same time, later will teach you how to look for them properly.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
@ krakof: What that indicator does? (Symbol changer profit).

--- 帖子 #219 ---
[quote=blanca;12677423]Second part of the ribbons.- The ribbons can also be used to place the stoploss and the targets, Look at this one, I have placed the stoploss under the 30sma Blanca did you mean to post a chart in your post #202? Would appreciate it if so.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Ok Blanca. But the CCI 21 (yellow line) crossed the 200 level some 7 bars before the entry, why the waiting? Maybe so that the price closed above the previous highs? Thanks, Jaime

--- 帖子 #221 ---
[quote]Blanca Jmmac is the yellow line, the 21 sma that has to touch the 200 level. Beren look at the breakout with the signal triggered at the same time, later will teach you how to look for them properly. Just to clarify, Blanca. you mean 21 cci, right?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Yes Myprofit the 21 cci in the double cci indicator it is a yellow line. Jmmac we need the green zone at least to touch the 200 level too, it gives us the strength and the impulse, remember we are using a 5 min chart and there is a lot of noise in a small timeframe what we are doing with all the indicators is trying to filter this noise and just leave the breakouts. If we used only the 21 yellow line we would have a lot of false breakouts, in conjuction with a bigger trend we are able to filter the noise. Also look what we are doing with the ribbons, we are using multitimeframes, it is a way to clear up the way too. Let me post a chart of a trade I saw today, London had very nice moves today.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I understand the need to filter the trades but I'm still stuck on the CCI signal part... sorry if I'm being dumb! When I look at the trade you posted (Krakof's trade) you plotted a vertical red line of the trigger bar. On that bar, the CCI green bars do not reach the 200 level, only several bars later.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yes you are right it was my mistake, the vertical line should be posted later, let me post the exact entry, in a while

--- 帖子 #225 ---
many many thanks. this changes the total outlook of analysing zigzag and identifying reversals.

Hello, can you explain how to set is up, thankyou

--- 帖子 #231 ---
This is the Version 6 of the Kino T3 ribbon. You can specify the number of bars to go back, which is very helpful for back-checking. It is by the same author as the Blanca's version and they are identical on my charts. Timeframes can also be specified on V6. Thanks to the great coder mladen.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Chart with V6 kinos with 10000 bars, showing a 25 Nov chart. Best to start with bare chart and apply the kinos and other indis in same order as Blanca's template. Else the kinos will hide MAs, etc.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thank you Blanca for sharing the system. I will give it a try. It's weekend and I am analyzing the friday's market. I saw some traps. Screenshot of two of them is below. I think when there are fast moves or potencial reversals of trends on a bigger timeframes the signals can come too late. It is too much noise there. But I think I woulnd't go to a trade here because potential stop loss levels are to far away from the entry. I also saw a lot of signals on other pairs with awesome risk reward ratios (1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and I found one with 1:9). That is insane. I am really grateful that you are sharing this system with us here. God bless you. Hope we will make insane amounts of pips here together. How do you watch all the pairs and catch the signals? Do you watch a big amount of charts on your screen? How long do you trade this system? How many hours per day you watch the charts? What is the percentage of good and fake signals? I know, I asked you a lot of questions. But in this momment I have a lot more questions which I will rather ask you later. So there is more chance you will answer. I would also like to thank to all the contributors here on this thread. I have also another question for all of you. Can anybody code the alert signal when all the criterias are met? So we could play with with our children, read the books, cooking a dinner, playing PS4, having nice time with our close friends and when we hear the sound we can take the trade . That would be awesome. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #237 ---
.- Good end of year for all. I have built a scanner for "My Go To Trading System". I expect the screenshots to be explanatory enough on how you can use it There are 2 main parts for the scanner to work - Scanner setups (maximum 3 combinations) - Number of symbols (pairs) to scan, first N pairs from MT4 Market Watch window Scan will only be made on open markets. Green buttons means open markets, maroon (reddish) means closed markets. Alerts are set as mobile notifications, screen alerts (sound), and email.

Hi to the Blanca clan, can somebody pse explain how the kino t3ma indicator is made up. ie which MA's are being used to form the ribbon. Thank you in advance. May everybody have a great 2020!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Good morning guys, Its awesome the things we will be able to do together, thank you very much for the scanner and all your ideas, it would be specially great if someone could do an alert signal when all the criteria is met because they are many, still I need to tell you about the Pivots and how will help us filter the signals too like the one matefx just showed, they could be avoided with the use of pivots to filter. some well will be a loss but will teach you how to take advantage even from the losses. See u tonight, the market is already open and enjoy your day. Welcome Praetor, Vinforex, sick, carmelina, and heroes, thank you guys

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hello Blanca That's scanner intention.... Alerts! If new rules are defined, I may add them as well. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hola sick35, Thank You for your Scanner, looks good, if you can answer this 3 questions I will appreciate it.. a). Any expiration date on it? b).Could you ad the 1 Hour-Daily pivots? c).In this case, the 240 Ma setting means that only below or above that Ma we are going to receive Scanner signals? What about if we put 50 or 21, it will work with the Blancas 89-21 template? d}. What the 30 Ma has to do with this settings??? Gracias por tu ayuda y respuesta. Happy New Year To All!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #244 ---
.- MyProfit, a). I used some parts from another project's code template, and forgot to remove expiration I had set for that project. For now it's defined to end on March 31st 2020. I'll remove it on next version. b). On next version. c). Correct. It should use whatever input you set on any input field, so yes. d). I think I may have skipped/forget what 30 MA has to do regarding rules. Please link to that info and I may add it, no problem. Everybody, Scanner do alert at the open of current candle if conditions are met for previous candle. That's because of 2 reasons: performance and waiting until all criteria is finally set. .

--- 帖子 #245 ---

Hello Blanca Thank you for starting this thread. Very few accomplished traders will spare their time and effort for the newbies like us. I have been reading it for the past 4 hours. I would like to ask how you install the template. Which folder do you put it?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Template goes in Templates folder Larry

--- 帖子 #253 ---
In MetaTrader4 click on File=&gt;Open data folder. Next step is open the folder Templates and copy the file with extension *.tpl in it. Next step is: go to previus folder and go to MQL4=&gt;Indicators. Now copy the rest files in it. Now open the Navigator in MetaTrader4. Find indicators and right click on it and click refresh. The last step is: Load the template "Mygotosystem1.tpl". Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Thanks a lot. I have managed to do all the steps except for the last one. How do I "load the template"?

--- 帖子 #255 ---

Hi Krakof and other members of this thread. I’m not a trader who uses a lot of indi’s but I am interested to see how this system performs. The system designer and thread starter has put in a lot of effort. krakof, I personally would be wary of UJ entries as the one shown, as the Yen has been trading in tight ranges and the system has triggered you into a trade when the Yen has already travelled, and exceeded its ADR. Probably best to look at trending currencies with higher ADR’s when entering late/r into a move. EURAUD and GBPAUD being two possible options. You can only take trades as the system dictates and the most important thing with a system is to stick with it. All the best and good luck.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
[quote=sick35;12679366].- Good end of year for all. I have built a scanner for "My Go To Trading System". Looks very nice. In your next version, wonder if you could add suffix ability. It is not working on mine with the .pro suffix in the symbols. The journal says the indi loaded succesfully but I have nothing showing. I have the 28 pairs in the mkt watch, and can't think of anything else. Thank you.

Good morning guys, Nice to see you working so early todays trade is Dow jones, you can see it fall down big time, will post the chart once I finish it, for the ones you have found some signals mixed there are abilities of trading to avoid those signals try not to trade inside the ribbons in the middle of pivots, lets work together in that, enjoy your day.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Krakof if you let me give you the advice of don't do reentries, they are extremely dangerous in any system and would ruin you very quickly, at least they don't work in this system dear. Trading is not a game or a gamble so please try to follow the system as it is, discipline is part of being a trader too.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi Dreadlocks, thanks for answering but you misunderstood the question or maybe I didn't explain myself properly. My perception is that the kino indi is made up of multiple MA's, but I can't seem to match the indicator with any MA ie: When the setting reads MA1 = 27 and MA2 = 36, I can't match it with any MA, not 27 SMA or EMA or SMA or LWMA. Therefore the question, how do I match it or is the problem lying in the factor1 and 2 which moves the ma forward or backward, which I also tried but with no avail.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Todays Trade, Dow jones today and all the indexes in general went down, I have opened the chart so you can see the exact entry as it was too fast but all the conditions met, My entry was below DS1 pivot please take a look at the CCI filter it has turned the first bar red, so please take a look how all the red bars keep there until now.

[quote=Backspin;12680698] .- Hello guys, Regarding scanner &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please confirm if you are able to show/hide the buttons either using the "/" on your keyboard (only for open markets from the first N you set in inputs), or the "A" on your keyboard (for all N pairs -open or closed- as you set in inputs). Please remember to set " Alerts enabled " input to " Yes " to be able to get alerts. Regarding suffixes, scanner should find any pair just as MT4 has them defined, so no need to add suffixes, please test showing buttons as explained to check it's working as it should. You can always change the 28 input setting to anything you want. I even tested it with more than 200 symbols, but be aware it could affect platform performance load depending on your machine specifications (it shouldn't be a problem with current technology, though) This is an example for 194 symbols, for which 165 are open Attached Image (click to enlarge) And showing all 194 : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Fell free to post your results, as it helps further developing and to solve possible problems with scanner Thank you .

... Ignored Hi Sick35, Ive got alerts but no buttons (even with alert enabled yes) Would it be possible doing a dashboard with the currencies and signals up and down plus signal since x bars ? Thank you anyway best

--- 帖子 #280 ---
.- Hi Rosalieone, Buttons are there to be able to change pair quickly. In order to be able to show them (and hide them) you have to use your keyboard keys as shortcuts. I set "/" and "A" keys as default, you can change those to any selection you want, as long as selected key doesn't interefere with MT4 deafult function keys. *Edit: mouse focus has to be on the chart, otherwise it won't work Possibly I will add similar functionality as you suggest, I've been thinking to implement something similar for a while. .

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hello all, First thanks Blanca for this great system. I follow greatly this thread. But for all, i want to say that we are at this time of the year, in a very bad zone for trading, you will have lots of traps, etc. For me, i will open the shop at the 6th january 2020. See ya all, and have great times with your family, etc.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
"A" function is working

--- 帖子 #290 ---
.- That's why. On next version I'll add small buttons to show/hide all others. Thank you Backspin That would be solved using new buttons, thanks for your input MyProfit .

--- 帖子 #291 ---
.- Then alerts should work. Last 5 min/Daily Pivot on my platform (forex) was more than 18 bars back. Be patient .

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Using the "A" shortcut and setting cci trigger to 10 I had an alert. ... and another on USDCAD ... and another on EURCHF

--- 帖子 #293 ---
.- "A" function is only used to show / hide buttons in order to switch to that pair by clicking the button Scanner works whether buttons are there or not .

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Ok that is great then, I'm getting several alerts with the fast CCI setting, so all seems well in the "A" function.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
.- Backspin, can you confirm that returned setups are valid according to the parameters you set for testing ? .

--- 帖子 #296 ---
But remember that this "system' use the 200 cci alerts settings, maybe if it can be modified (system) we can use a &gt;100?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
.- You can set it as you need. If it works with one setting, it should work it any. Today there's been a lack of setups, so it's useful to know if it's working on another machines besides code developing machine. * Edit : Just like keyboard issue MyProfit! .

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Sick, I was away from the computer. Will set the CCI better to evaluate this and get back to you.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I got a signal--original settings- Attached Image edited And another 2, "100" settings Attached Image edit And many more 100 setting (not trading this ones -100- yet) just watching the signals and I wonder the difference between strong short setup and short setup ?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I've had some signals on this CCI setting in the last few minutes. All are correct so far. A suggestion would be to put the most important CCI first (the Trend CCI, Blanca's 89 setting), and then the Entry cci (21 yellow) second, and label them that way so there is no confusion.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Small correction to my post just above. You do have the bigger cci first, which is good, but the default was on 21 when I got it and that was my confusion. Anyway, labels would make it clearer.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
UJ short and did not give a long signal in the previous up move, which is correct.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
.- Thank you Backspin By the "... STRONG..." text on some alerts I meant the "almost vertical" move on CCI which Blanca mentioned on some post. I have corrected those to "Vertical Move Long" and "Vertical Move Short", as those not necessarily meet all rules.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
On this GBPCHF signal, it appears it is signalling on the fast 21 cci re-crossing my 25 trigger line.

--- 帖子 #305 ---

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Oh... good, Sick35 could you check post #243? Also, can we move the indicator to the right side or any place?And, can the buttons be "highlighted" if we entered a trade in those pairs, red losing pips,green, winning pips? Whatever you can do is fine with me, Thank You very much for you effort to help us , Gracias

OK I reset and I am again at 21 and 89 instead of 89/21. I will widen the 21 to be more "out of reach" and reduce the 89 so I get some signals. We are in wide spreads for about another hour so will take a while to be a valid test.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
. - Sorry MyProfit, I misundestood c) question on your post Scanner works independently from templates or indicators on any chart. They are not "connected" in any way. Its results depend entirely on what inputs you set. .

--- 帖子 #316 ---
There are already tools for tasks like that, I won't complicate things atm. Regarding, moving the indicator, you can just hide buttons, as scanner works all the time, with and without buttons. *Edit. I'll look into moving indicator anyway, thanks for the suggestion I hope that helps .

--- 帖子 #317 ---
There were some comments before where some folks were having dificulty loading the indicators. The process below works OK for me. How to get Blanca's Indicators installed: 1. Set up a folder in Explorer under a Directory of your choosing. I like to use My Download Files. Right click My Download File or whatever Directory foilder you choose. A menu should appear and allow you to select a New Folder, scroll down the menu util you see NEW. Give it a name like Blanca's System. Next create a sub folder to Blanca's sub-folder with a different name like Indicators. 2. If you are using MS Edge this is fairly straight forward. Just left click on the indicator and it will show up at bottom of MS Edge, It will show the name of the file you want to download and say |Open| Save|(up arrow)|, Cancel|. Click on up arrow and click 'Save As'. It will then open Explorer to allow you to save the file to a folder. Locate your directory and open it so all primary sub-folders are showing. Locate the sub folder 'Blanca's Sys' and open it so it's sub- folder is showing. Right click the folder and select COPY from the menu screen. 4. Continue doing this until you have all the indicators in that sub- folder. Do NOt add the Template to that folder. That ls a separate process. 5. Go to your MT4&gt;File&gt;Open Data Folder. 6. Double click on MQL4. right click once on Indicators folder and select PASTE from the menu. Close Explorer. 7. Go to the Navigator window and right click on any white space showing. It does not matter if one of the showing indicators should highlight. A menu window will come up. Scroll down until you see the word REFRESH and click on it. The elevator bar should move up and down then stop. 7. Now scroll up or down until you see your folder. Double click the folder and all the indicators should be there. End of story. Loading the tpl is a littel different. Make sure you did not load it with the indicator package. Now copy the tpl. open the Data File Folder in MT4 and then look for Templates. No need to open MQL4. Right click once to highlight the template folder, then look for PASTE in the drop down menu. No need to do Refresh. Just click on the Templates box on the front of the MT4 and it shoud be there. And That's it. I am finding this system to be very good as it makes pips. Thank you Blanca. you are most generous all around.

Thank you for My Go-To scanner, I have installed it is quite handy. One question if it has one scan condition does that mean that it will only notify when the DP is hit on a 5M timeframe? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #325 ---
More signals with same setting as in my previous post. All are correct signals. So this is back to where I was before the reset with the trend cci was the second setting. On another MT 4 I have the scanner running with interchanged settings and there are no signals at all. (correction in post 326)

I am now getting identical signals from both these settings on separate MT4s.

Pardon me for asking , why did you set to 25 instead 200 cci lvl ?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
.- Scanner Update Replaced keyboard shortcuts with a single button. Added last setup bar count and threshold input , default to 30 bars back. You must select for what setup you want the count and corresponding setup colors to be displayed on buttons. If you want to monitor more than one scan setup it's advisable to have 1 chart per scan setup, so each one will show specific scanned setups count separately. Added Corner input for buttons placement. You can also play with "Rows", "Buttons width" and "Font size" inputs, as all of them affect buttons measurements and placement. Added 1 hr Setups / Daily Pivots scan option. Set " Alerts enabled " to Yes by default. Thanks to the contributors that have been actively helping with scanner testing.

[quote=sick35;12681717].- Scanner Update Thank you. Looking forward to this.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
The scanner works very well

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Good day everybody, Thank you so so much for the scanner, I am already using it and its great. We do not have to wait anymore and see the grass grow to get a signal, today the only one with movement in London was USDJPY, a sell, please look how a clear breakout appears and once the signal is triggered it reaches the pivot. PIVOTS .- The pivots are levels of support or resistances, they are calculated daily. Imagine that the price is a car that goes in a highway, and the pivots are the tolls through which the car has to pass in order to go to the next one, sometimes if you pay the feel then you pass the toll, but if you don't you just don't go through and you might have to go back to the previous one. Invariably the price moves from one pivot to another looking for support or resistance. Thank you very much Sick, Baren very kind of you doing the scanner it will be a very useful tool for all of us, feel free to contribute in everything you want, I am also planning a way to earn some money with our signals at the same time we are learning, remember this is a business so let me think about it, kind regards and Happy new year everyone XOXO How we will use the pivots in this system: If a signal is too near to a pivot we will not take it, remember we are in a 5min timeframe so its a way to avoid the noise We will use the pivot as target usually, like in the example below, Also as a stoploss, once a signal is triggered we will try to look for an entry the nearest to a pivot in order to place our stoploss above it or below it, they are great places to put an stoploss The same rules applies to the ribbons, they are invisible levels of supports and resistances too.

. - Green = Currently open market (no setup within threshold limits) Maroon = Closed market (no setup within threshold limits) ^ both open or closed condition according to MT4 broker specifications for each scanned instrument. Blue = Latest setup was a Long Setup (bars ago). Orange = Latest setup was a Short Setup (bars ago). Latest setup count depends on "Last setup threshold" input. .

Hi All and Blanca, First off, thank you so much for your knowledge and time to help others become successful. I am transitioning out of real estate into currency trading with some limited knowledge but can always learn more. Sick, thanks too... nice addition. Your system, dealing with the M5, what is the average gain on pips? I have been dealing with H1 chart on EUR/USD and realize my goals of 400pips a month is pushing it with the money management plan i have. 20pips a day on average, shouldn't be too hard, right? Easier said than done with EU. Each trade costs money so I would like to do fewer trades in where i can capitalize the most to gain 400pips a month. My current technical system deals with Eiliott wave, fibonnaci and drawing lines on the H1 to predict TP. So there are some similarities with yours. I would like to focus more on the H1 charts to limit my time in front of the computers, what changes to your system would I need to do so that i can work on the H1 charts. I use the M1 charts to fine tune my entry points as well with my current system utilizing a 10pip SL. Please let me know more about the H1 chart setup. Happy New Years everyone!

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Sick, Thanks for this amazing trading tool. If I may suggest an improvement; The relevant button gives the number of bars back when a signal happened for a particular pair. Is it possible to have an arrow at that specific bar when we bring up the relevant chart? Also, my broker is VantageFx which has a suffix of + for the forex pairs. The problem that I am facing is that the Hide feature of market watch does not seem to work. I have to display 50 instruments before I can get all the 28 relevant forex pairs to display. Any suggestions? Thanks

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Happy new year to all of you. Sick35 it's working everything ok till now. If I will find some bug, I will tell you.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
.- Hello TradeForexFx, I'm not sure I understand your question about Market Watch. Scanner works with first N symbols listed on Market Watch window (you can set that number setting it in inputs). If you want only FX symbols to be scanned and displayed in the buttons, move them to the first N symbols on Market Watch window, you may need to restart the indicator for changes to take effect. .

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi to all! Thanks for your effort to make a good scanner but seems that all attention is directed do to that. There are still very few messages or examples that explains how to trade scanner signals or simply how to trade blanca's system.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I assume the thread starter Blanca is letting traders work the system out for his or herself before providing further information. i personally don’t see it as a system that will provide a lot of entries when rules are followed as the trigger filter 21 MA and 89 cci are not a great trigger in my opinion. A good percentage of those trigger entries you will receive will be after a move has been generated and the “easy” money has been taken out of the market, and the move is close to a pullback and shake out. There will be those trend breakouts that keep going with momo but more often than not the entry as per system will alert just before a base and pull back. I’m happy to be proven wrong. A trader could look to enter on the pull back/retrace etc. When manually trading a system look at the system entry generated and use it to help you learn how to read chart price action. i personally have not found indicators to be the holy grail but I’m sure some traders can make them work... All my opinion and I hope the traders here make good pips with the system

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Good morning in this new year, Hi everybody and thank you for being part of this thread, I hope something goodd you will receive of it for your trading life, We are using a 5 min timeframe and there is noise in this timeframe just like there is noise in any other timerame, this is a breakout system and a follow trend system, but something maybe few of you have noticed is that we are also using realtime tools. The ribbons are realtime invisible levels of supports and resistances and the Pivots are realtime tools, too. We will be using them in our advantage in order to filter some of the losses or false breakouts. Another thing that will help us get the most not only of this system but from any system are the money management tecnniques, in order for them to work first we need a system with certain degree of success, like this, also the abilities of the trader are involved, the more you learn and read books the better you will trade any system.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Can i ask why you still have a dayjob, when been trading for 10+ years with a succesful system? You chose to keep working cause you like it that way, or?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Sure Pagh, My day job is being the Fund Manager of a currency and cfds broker in a WTC office in mexico city, I will be organizing a seminar soon in case you are interested, it is a job totally related to trading and that lets me trade all the time. Plus this is not the only system I have developed, as you can imagine in so many years, many things have been developed by me, even as we are speaking. I also trade remotely for a hedge fund in new York, if you want to see my profile you can find it in LinkedIn as Blanca Arizpe, Professional Futures Trader, in order to achieve something like that you need a license and studies as a chartist, I can tell you where to go and study if you are interested too. I am sure there are many talented people or even more talented than me in this forum so I found no reason to explain everything I do, but you are asking so I answer. Now back to Trading

--- 帖子 #356 ---
In the chart above you will see a the market signaling a trade inside the ribbons, as we have mentioned the ribbons are levels of supports and resistance that are not fixed, they move as the market is moving at the same time and you will find that every time you see your charts the ribbons specially the smaller timeframes will keep changing. In the example above you can see that in this case the signal appeared in a ribbon with some space, so in this case the trade is free to run, which it doesn't mean it will do it as free as if we were in empty space, but it sure can. Now we see its safe to entry, the first thing we have to do is to find our target, it is absolutely important to never enter a trade without knowing which your target is, in this case we will be using the other extreme of the ribbon as target, which ifi you look closely it also agrees with the pivot. In trading is a very common thing that you find that when a tool is confirmed by another usually is a sign that something you are doing right. Ok so we enter, we place our stoploss above the pivot and go to the next level. And the result is a trade that we could call by the book, look how the trade ended in our target, exactly there, that means not only we were right but no surprises, the plan was correct from beginning to end. In my opinion in any system you don't have to be right all the time, not all the signals have to be successful and so far I have not seen any holy grail, probably it exists but I have not seen it yet, but what we can certainly do is to take everything positive we can from every signal, and money management tecnhiques are the key to do that, so please read about them, when you can. Now the scanner, I have just uploaded and it will for sure help us specially to not be glued to the screen, but doesn't mean we do not have to do the work, of planning each and every trade we see, it does not mean that every signal it shows us is going to be correct or on time, also in the system we do not have to take all the signals, we will learn together how to cherrypick them the more we can, and also even during a loss how to take advantage of it in our favour we will be using money management techniques for that, so please when you can read about them, they are many kinds I will only show you one or two for this system but I am sure you will find more.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Later I will be editing the first post to add the indicators, template and a brief explanation of the system so we all can get it right and easy to find. I will also start speaking about the rhythm of the instruments, they all have different rythms, indexes are not the same as currencies and not every currency moves at the same pace, so we will find in which ones this system works best, also please trade the system under the rules I gave you otherwise its useless to trade it if you don't find it useful there are many other systems in this forum to choose from, here is all about trading this system. Enjoy this new year guys and lets have fun together. XOXO

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I agree in your comment, I operate with another system, and I usually wait for the setbacks to make my entries. I put some tickets that I made today, one is a market operating according to the rules of the Blanca system, but as I think it will make a setback, I put a limited sale 1,45333. Now to wait

Hallo Blanca. I wish you a happy new year. It is the first time that I write something in this forum. I want to thank you, that you teach us to be a good trader and sharing your very good system with al your knowledge. I will follow you, because I am very shure that you know what you do. So sorry about my english, I am a german but living in Lima Peru since 22 years. Also thanks to everybody who give good informations into this thread, and a happy new year with a lot green pips. It is a good way to have fun while learning. Saludos Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Happy New Year to all!, started using this system, and until now, so far,so good... Attached Image (click to enlarge) I know the effort that Blanca put to develop this system and to sick35 for the scanner, thank you both. The scanner works great, but in my opinion it can be optimized with a few options..I'm going to put some of them here.. and maybe "Los Reyes Magos" will bring it... a).Highlight the pairs that we are trading with different color, winners a color,losers another. b).Highlight the pair when the first or second..bar alert is generated (if we are in a trade in that pair a NEW alert will be deactivated, maybe for the threshold duration? 3). Reset the scanner with new button colors if we choose to re-start trading

Hi all, My thanks to blanca, MT4 isn't my trading platform, but when something interesting comes a long I set it up on a demo account and initiate trades on Ctrader. My knowledge is very limited with MT4. However I have set it all up and i believe correctly. The platform it has slowed down dramatically even with only one chart open, it would be impossible to execute fast trades. I have fiber internet connection with very fast speeds. When I added the scanner it stopped altogether. I deleted and re added still the same. I then reduced down to 4 pairs on the watch list and it started working in that it gave me the buttons all showing green. Over the last 12 hours GBPNZD my go to pair when things are quiet, moved 150 pips in text book fashion between DR1 and DP. The scanner gave me no signal on any pair, and the screen was not frozen...I installed using the default settings. Perhaps my broker on the demo account is the problem...? Any assistance would be appreciated ,and thanks to all who have contributed.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Andrew, I to have a target for average pips per month....its better to have average per month than average per day..... I believe choosing the pair you trade plays a big part in achieving your goal. you need an active/volatile pair and it needs to be active during your preferred trading time. I trade GBPNZD. ADR currently 160pips and it is regularly 300 pips. So plenty of scope to conservatively pick up your monthly goal. Im interested in blanca's method for entering a trade as I believe it will still give plenty of opportunities in a volatile pair but perhaps less risk

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Yes Axecap I agree with you that having a goal per month is easier than a goal per day, and in fact my system has very nice moves in gbpnzd, seems we need some volatility and also the currencies that has bigger daily ranges are the ones with highest profitability.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi guys, Its so nice you are already taking a lot of them, I will for sure edit the first post in order to have indicators, template and a brief explanation. Just an observation, this system as you have seen is not a set and forget, does not even have a fixed target or stoploss as you have all experienced, there are some false signals we need to avoid and I will help you with that as we are scalping guys in a very small timeframe. The scanner will help us to save time watching the charts instead of being glued to them, but will not by any mean replace a traders plan or abilities, once the scanner signals a trade you still have to decide if it is fulfilling the requirements or not, just a comment so you don't rely totally on it. Tonight we had many signals I am sure you guys saw them, all of them clean breakouts. I will let the guys finish their scanner and their instructions, those things sometimes take time and refinement and later will continue with the explanation of how to avoid the losses, Meanwhile post your entries, targets, please explain your plan, please write about the pivots, have not seen anyone mention them, your reasons to take the trade. Vickypumpkin welcome I totally understand what you want, will edit the first post but I want to tell you this is not an easy system for newbies, it contains realtime tools, based on Fibonacci numbers and uses a lot of filters, still have only explained like 3\4 parts of the system, But with some practice and analyzing the reasons behind the system you will soon be able to trade it, remember this is not a set and forget system, no fixed instructions will make it work either, not even the scanner will substitute your trading skills. Patience and discipline are the keys in trading, knowledge is behind any trader, I also encourage you to read books, like Trading in the Zone, Reminicenses of an operator, Candlesticks, etc The knowledge cannot come purely from the forum or one thread, just like any career you have to read books all of them are now available online, unlike when I started, in order to get a Fibonacci book I had to visit the main University everyday to take copies so please take advantage of the technology and read all you can.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Michael thank you for your kind words, Daniela, all you guys welcome I hope you take something valuable for your trading life, when you make a trade try to post the reasons , the plan, imagine you are going to be hired and you need to show you are good, because someday someone will ask you to show your abilities in order to trust their money to you. The more you do that, the deeper your knowledge will be and the more questions will arise too. What do you guys think about this entry? Is it good, is it valid or not, do you think has enough strength? Enjoy your day and have fun too XOXO.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hello! Thanks for your answer. Blanca said: "we will be trading inside the ribbons from extreme to extreme, usually in the cases the ribbons are big and open". So, I think it was a valid trade

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I try...big space between ribbons, price was far from pivot or other "walls" but it is not a valid signal IHMO because cci didn't reach -200 level.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi, I think it was a very high risk trade, because left CCI,did not pass -200 level. Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi Blanca, 1 Is It Good-----with my limited knowledge, if it can close above DS2--potential to DS1 2 Valid Yes if I understand your entry system i.e crossed -200 Lvl (Yellow Line and also almost vertical from zero Lvl) 3 Mt answer is Fib based and it is Yes. Thank you for your valuable work, as you say a good understanding of trading is necessary to enjoy what you are doing / Good night from Australia, it's after midnight and time to turn the lights off.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Blanca, about the pivots, when we get a valid signal, in this moment the pivot is very near, I also use fibonacci and an indicator what shows me support, resistance and turn coat levels. Realy it make me a little nervose when it happen. So, How we can do? Maby waiting that the price go near of pivot 2? Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hallo Sick35. I want to thank you for the nice scanner it is very helpful. Please, but how I can change the currency pairs? I would like to have the same ons like in my symbol changer: AUDCAD,AUDCHF,AUDNZD,AUDUSD,AUDJPY,CADCHF,CADJPY,CHFJPY,EURAUD,EURCAD,EURCHF,EURGBP,EURJPY,EURNZD,EURUSD,GBPAUD,GBPCAD,GBPCHF,GBPJPY,GBPNZD,GBPUSD,NZDCAD,NZDCHF,NZDJPY,NZDUSD,USDCAD,USDCHF,USDJPY. It´s possible, that I do it, or only you can do it? Thank you so much for your help. Best regards Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Yes guys the trade has not reached the 200 level, and Michael about the pivots, you are so right of being nervous of starting a trade near a pivot, they are usually like walls specially when the volume is low, so its better to avoid a trade when the pivots are near, so we either wait until it cross and we keep on looking the the indicators if they are still strong or better look for another one, there are plenty of trades look for the next one, also in doubt look for the perfect setup, there is no rush, try to take the best setup and it also comes with a good risk reward, you can find a good risk reward, in the next post will write an example of how to find a small stoploss with a high risk reward eveyr time.

Thnak you very much sick, I would like to know the same thing too if you are so kind.

...thank you for answer so fast, but I dont know what you mean, in the settings of the scanner, in this plase is written 28, and on the left side by market watch I cannot make a change, this field is not to open. Please help. Michael.MSA

.- If there are still any of you struggling with MT4 performance, there are ways to improve it. Do a search with something like "How to optimize MT4" and you will find plenty of resources on methods that probably will help you, as MT4 is not the most efficient platform in some aspects. .

No, I feel it has not met all of your requirements to even consider it as a trade opportunity.

@Bianca, Thank you so much for the explanations and i do appreciate it.. i have read alot of books and also attend classes. Alot of schools,classes and people gave up on some lagging indicators so i am not too deep in it. But thanks once again; and i want you to know you're the best!

Do I miss something? Yellow line CCI not reached -200 level?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
... I think the red vertical lines also habe to reach -200. Greetings Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #402 ---
would be nice A video

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I'm posting my trades again from last evening to give more explanations. In both cases the 89 CCI had touched the 200 trigger line. Also, the yellow 21 CCIs were aggressive. Both trades were below the Daily Pivot (DP) and the 240 MA and there were no ribbons below giving support. There were no "obstructions" before the DS1. There was enough space to DS1 to give me better than 1:1 RR. I used my trade manager (TM) EA and set the SL just above the previous small swing low on UJ and in the second ribbon above on the EJ. Using 1% risk (always), the TM automatically calculates the lot size. I clicked on it for a short trade and by my preset gives me an entry line 5 pips below the current price. I then adjust the entry line up or down depending on the exact entry I want, usually slightly below the low price (or higher price on a long trade). The entry triggered and then I adjusted the TP line to what I wanted In the case of the UJ my exit setting was what I got. In the case of the EJ I saw the price was starting to wobble and hesitate and I clicked to close the trade. It was also late and getting past my bed time. And I was more than 3% ahead on the trades. A trade manager saves a lot of time and hassle, and stress. Mine is a private one from someone else and I am not at liberty to post it. But there are some on FF and also commercial ones. Maybe someone can suggest a free one for those who aren't familiar. The one I use has a problem with entries at market. It occasionally does not put the stops where I'm telling it to (usually too close to price). So I will soon go back to a commercial one. It's a bit of a resource hog but I will make adjustments. At the moment I have three charts always open and ready to go with Blanca's template. When Sick's GREAT scanner on a separate MT4 gives me an alert, I use the market watch to just drag the symbol onto a chart to see if the signal is good. Personally, I have to do some more manual back-testing and find the pairs that move the best in my trading hours. I will also check M15 history on some pairs. That's my story for now. Have a great weekend. P.S. I would appreciate a Thumbs up click (bottom right of this post), from anyone who finds this post useful. I don't want to go on like a babbling idiot if this is not helpful to anyone. Thanks.

Hi guys, I will try to make a video indeed, thank you so much for all your comments, very kind of you. Backspin I really like you are getting so deep in the system that you are already designing and EA, but let me explain you one thing about this system and the EAs, they simply Do not work , too many things to take care about, the stoploss and take profit are unique every time, the risk reward is always different and some of the trades are inside the ribbons and we have not even mentioned the news which should always be considered or the patterns to find. So an Ea would be just like many more just a scam not to mention the legal problems involved I would think it twice. . Plus usually the systems that turn into EAS in this forum its because someone wants to sell something and take some kind of advantage. I am not selling anything and do not plan to sell anything, just sharing for free, trying to get people to learn with the only purpose of helping them improve their skills, even if we do it manually its important to learn to trade, the skills acquired are really important. So please no one post any EA here, there is nothing to sell here.

Hi Blanca, thank you so much for making a video. Best regards Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #408 ---
[quote = blanca; 12686979] Ciao ragazzi, cercherò davvero di fare un video, grazie mille per tutti i vostri commenti, molto gentile da parte vostra. Backspin Mi piace davvero che tu stia diventando così profondo nel sistema che stai già progettando e EA, ma lascia che ti spieghi una cosa su questo sistema e gli EA, semplicemente non funzionano, troppe cose di cui occuparsi, lo stoploss e il profitto è unico ogni volta, la ricompensa del rischio è sempre diversa e alcune delle operazioni sono all'interno dei nastri e non abbiamo nemmeno menzionato le notizie che dovrebbero sempre essere prese in considerazione o gli schemi da trovare. Quindi un Ea sarebbe come molti altri solo una truffa per non parlare dei problemi legali coinvolti, lo penserei due volte. . Inoltre di solito i sistemi che diventano EAS in questo forum sono perché qualcuno vuole vendere qualcosa e trarne qualche vantaggio. Non sto vendendo nulla e non intendo venderlo, condivido gratuitamente, cercando di far imparare le persone con l'unico scopo di aiutarle a migliorare le loro abilità, anche se lo facciamo manualmente è importante imparare a commerciare, le competenze acquisiti sono davvero importanti. Quindi per favore nessuno pubblica EA qui, non c'è niente da vendere qui. [/ Quote] Hi Blanca! I think that backspin spoke of a ea which simply help managing the trade...calculating size, risk rateo, stop loss, etc. Not one that take decisions for us...Sorry for my bad english

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I know dear, backspin has only been trying to contribute so I just asked him not to post any EA, still it wont work, too many things to look after. The problem is that sometimes some people might try to sell these EAs , in old times they used to sell everything even if those systems were bad. Nowadays its not possible, many things are legally protected but still some keep on doing it and I do not mean Backspin who has been absolutely helpful, I am just making it clear this is a place to learn not to sell just in case, lol, This thread is to learn, to share and of course do business with our skills. Did you know Spanish is very similar to Italian? I had no idea until now, lol its so cool

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Blanca, Thanks for the challenge on this post. As this 5 min chart as posted went on to achieve approximately 60 plus pips, I for one, and I guess others here would appreciate your detailed response. Scalping a 5 min chart for something like 10 odd pips with your valued input is what the contributors here are trying to learn so we look forward to your ongoing support in future posts. and of course the Video. Thank you for sharing your valued trading knowledge with us. Kind regards Ben

Hi Blanca,thank you for your thread. You're a good person. And I need helps :How to avoid such a situation?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
[引述][引述][12687257]嗨，布兰卡，谢谢你的帖子。你是个好人。我需要帮助：如何避免这种情况？{Image}[/引述] My idea: The price is at top of ribbons,lack of upward momentum. The ribbons are realtime invisible levels of supports and resistances. Is that so?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Yes dear, once the price has reached the extreme of a ribbon, its kind of over for the trade unless it has a lot of strength, in this case even though it worked inside the ribbons there are other better set ups that I will post soon and also how to avoid some of the losses in order to make it profitable, but also almost any system with the proper money management techniques can be profitable, we do not need the best system but we certainly need the best money management techniques.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hello B!, Just a reminder.. when making the video, kindly label or indicate each Indicator. E.g ribbon, MA e.t.c I get it mixed up. I can’t even identify the ribbon smh

determine the underlyings in the market window, then drag the indicator from the navigator window onto the chart, done.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
hellow blanca very interested your thread,,you can give me advice how identify false break setup?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Good morning guys , Today is the perfect day to speak about the news in trading. As we all have seen on Friday we started with very interesting news so lets ask ourselves how can we use them in trading and in our favour. As they affect directly some commodities specially oil. So depending about the country and its resources we will look what commodity can be raaffected, so buying oil on Friday was a good decision, any buy signal was fine, still at this moment if something relevant happens buying oil could also be a good decision as we have seen it going down for a while, even if its temporary, if we see another relevant new we could buy again, of course with signal. It also affects directly the Canadian dollar, they are related. How to avoid false breakouts In this system, we are scalping in a 5 min timeframe so noise is everywhere, Do not make entries in pivots or near pivots, they are like walls Do not make entries inside ribbons unless they are open Always look for a breakout and space, Looking for a bigger timeframe in order to take the trend would be preferable, a 4 hr is fine, although the signals work also in any trend. When a signal starts with a huge candle its better to let it pass, as the stoploss gets very big too, so don't take it. Please look how in the chart below the oil broke the ribbons, even slim which means the resistances were strong, and also pay attention at the size of the candles, they keep getting bigger and bigger until the end signaling that more traders were adding to the move.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
From post #99: "For a buy signal the price should be above the Daily Pivot" seems that it was not a very good signal dear Blanca what do you think about that?am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I rolled back the charts with my current levels , by that day the daily pivot was below the signal, look at the ribbons they are higher timeframes, once broken daily pivot was also behind everything also big news happening, so any excuse to buy was fine, the signal is just a trigger of whats happening but also common sense works here, you do not need to be a trader to have an idea of whats happening and that oil will raise immediately. Just explaining an example of how things move during important news, some commodities, indexes and even currencies can react to them, and in times of war the weapons stocks are also high. Just an example of this. Which does not mean we have to trade them, we always have a choice, but its a way of showing you guys that even during tough times money can be made.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi blanca, interesting strategy! Probalby you can find the time to do some live calls? A few signals in realtime would be awesome! Thank you Cheers Shaga

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi blanca, please could you post an exemple chart, from inside ribbons and open ribbons. Also please a breakout with space? Because I need to understand very well. I´m not shure, it make me worry. Please. Kind regards Michael.MSA

yeah a telegram group should work

Thanx so much for this amazing system Blanca and for this great Scanner Sick35 . I am happy to learn with the other users how it works. Let us make toghether a good trading year 2020. For me it´s a travel back to the future ( school )

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Blanca, you have misunderstood my post #403. I am not designing an EA. I have a trade manager EA to help me enter and manage trades. Entries are manual with this - I have to apply the EA on the chart for each trade and decide where to enter and exit myself by manually pulling entry and exit lines where I want them, according to the few parameters you've written. I don't know how to make an EA and have no interest whatsoever in doing so. I am looking forward to having all your tools and methods to understand exactly how to trade your system. Until then, I am suspending any practice out of concern that I might be creating bad habits. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi guys, Good evening, so glad to see you are enjoying it. Will for sure post several examples the nearest to realtime that I can, I also have to work but will do the best I can, and let me plan a video, to place it in the first post. Welcome you all and wish you the best for this year, we met last year but this one is going to be our great year guys, XOXO. Blanca

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Blanca Thanks for the painstaking effort in explaining this amazing trading system to us. I have used the system for some trades and it gave me 10pips in less than 2 hours. I found it to trigger more openings during the London session.

First much looks good but i would not open a sell position in this moment because the candle don`t looks good and got a small body with a longer small nose below. The candle lost much sell power . I would wait for the next candle. The next candle lost all sell power for this moment.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
At first thanks Blanca and Sick for this good Job, i would like to ask if any can upload template for the system because i tried to add the original template but there problems with and i don't see the Rebond, if not please any one give the settings for it. With best regards Hozan

--- 帖子 #435 ---
First thank you for sharing your idea here with us. Could you tell me why you use the Double CCi and Filter CCi here with those settings? Trend CCi is set to 89 and Filter CCi also set to 89, therefore they calculating the same thing and therefore are redundant here. The Entry CCi of the Double CCi has no role in your strategy (as far i currently understand it). So under that perspective it's not necessary to use Double CCi and the Filter CCi would be enough, when the alerts are use. If the alerts not used the MT4 internal CCi would do the same job when level 200 &amp; -200 are defined. Sorry: Found the reason for using the Double CCi in a later post: 2.- The double cci 89 and 21 are a combination of Fibonacci numbers, one is longer than the other, when both agree in the indicator appears volume in red or green. When this volume reaches the 200 levels above is a buy signal, when it reaches the -200 level is a sell signal. Also the yellow line has to either cross or at least touch the 200 level. Then still the use of the Filter CCi is unclear (maybe the alert in it).

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Blanca I would like to thank you for your generosity in sharing with us your great knowledge and experience. I love what you have shared so far. I had a great trade on AUDJPY this morning all the way to DS2. Anthony

Many thanks to Blanca for sharing such an impressive system. Sorry for your mum, I hope she'll get better soon. Also many thanks to sick35 for the scanner, whom I would present with a suggestion. I was wondering, since the fast CCI is very often a heads up for the setup to trigger, would it be possible to add an option to alert for it on its own? So to keep an eye in advance for a possible setup to happen sometime soon. Thank you. EDIT: I was forgetting: any chance for an option to add other pairs, like Gold etc.? And also, even better, to pick our preferred pairs from a list? Thank you.

Hi everybody who want to change the currency pairs in the scanner. The scanner look and choose the first 28 pairs what he find in the market whatch window of the mt4. Finally restart or reinstall the scanner. Kind regards Michael.MSA

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi, could anyone help me figure out how to use the scanner without having all the charts open. I can only seem to get alerts for charts that are either being displayed or are at least in the current profile I have open. It would be great to be able to scan all the currencies without having them all in a single profile as it slows down the mt4 platform a lot. As you might have guessed I'm relatively new to trading and any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hi Sick35 , would you renew the scanner after the expiry date which falls on March for free ?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
.- That has been already handled. Look for relevant post. .

--- 帖子 #445 ---
. - Please read the thread, you will find answer for that. Functionality to change/use other symbols is already on scanner. .

Thanks for sharing this system Blanca. I was looking for a simple scalping system for a while. I will give this a try, so far so good. How long would you keep a position open? If you see no movement in 24 hours, do you close the position? Would the following entry be a good entry? Considering it is inside of a ribbon.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hello sick35, testing the scanner I noticed some"bugs"? on it, if you can fix it will be great.. a.- When I start a session the scanner didn't appears ,I clicked multiple times the "s' letter with no results, but I found that if I change the bars threshold,10 to 9 ,etc, it appears, and work all session until the next one, again, changing the threshold bar quantity, it start working again... b.-I followed the market watch "trick" response, but the pairs didn't show in the right sequence? Attached Image c.- Tried to use the 1 hour -pivot setting but the scanner still send 5 min-pivot signals? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thank You, ths scanner can be a great asset to this method, it is very good!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Personally, I think far too many of you are using your energy on the scanner for this system and not the system. I would concentrate on the subtleties of the system more and less about a scanner at this stage. That said, I do not trade this system, although it is a well thought out mechanical system. With a little structural knowledge of the markets, and accomodating price movements, it is definitely a viable method. Respect to the system developer and thread author.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I think so too. The scanner is realy good, but we must wait for Blanca to learn all about the system. Blanca sayd that there are much more entry signals. I think it is a very good manual treading system and the scanner is perfekt when we are in background.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Without scanner will stay all day long with on the charts. I think the system is not work very well on all pair.I get a lot of fake signals.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
That's inherent bad side of all indicator - based fx trading systems. That does not mean they are not helpful but we need more complements that help us understand market background of the pair giving the signal before signal comes to decide to take that signal or not. If only relying on signal to win, a child can do that. Within a system, we can use higher timeframe to understand the global picture of a pair. Lower timeframe signals just are triggers for somewhere to take part into the journey of the path on higher timeframe. A short signal on M5 will be a trap to sell if H1 saying the pair is in uptrend.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Yah bro I agree many fake signals.... Nothing exceptional from most systems in the forum.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Infinoxcapital-demobhs 1000036717 bzbo6cy Check this and your comments valuable

--- 帖子 #456 ---
But there are subtleties to observe that may help eliminate bad entries.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I got alot of failing signals. I follow the rules. When I get it the price shoots quickly in the other direction. Anyone else having this problem?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Yes, me too, but: 1 Day of testing gave me something about 60%-65% of TP trades. My TP is based on atr And not on pivot system, but still its good result for me imho. System needs to be explored And we cant expect much from something we dont understand on 100%. I dont like this way of going in trade at middle or end of trend move, but it feels that i have lack of expirience. Something warm And familiar like ar home here in the air=) Thank you Blanca for this, waiting for more knowledge And your kindness.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I agree. Today I got 7 SL, but today is the first day of experience. I'll try again. We need more analysis and practice.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
all who claim about wrong signals plz make deep study of all blanca notes and what she written and spent your maximum time to understand system before triggering buy/sell. here my results and looks to me best system so far

--- 帖子 #461 ---
still i m also making many mistakes and sometime hurry to make trades its not system fault its mine

--- 帖子 #462 ---
It would be good to know these subtleties. so far nothing has been said other than make up your own

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I think we need better to understand notes.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I mean those things that Blanca has been mentioning, or says that she will talk more about, like use of the ribbons and pivots, avoiding trades around these in certain situations, money management. And some things are common sense, like perhaps (not) trading on NFP day.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Ribbons for me the biggest problem. Better to say: break outs from ribbons, they faked me a lot (signal on price breaking out a ribbon - was always a trap for me)

--- 帖子 #466 ---
You guys should take it easy, the op has already given us some hints on how to trade the system. All you have to do, is go back, take notes and screenshot the trading platform during live trading. Don't be a hurry to trade, just compare the notes and the message in the screenshot images at the end of that day's trading. You will see that the op has done a good job Put in some effort guys

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Badeel, could you explain us why you took a sell trade on GBPJPY the 10-01-2020 at 12:00? For me there is no sell signal if you follow the rules of this system of trading, no?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi 8tango, you are right. Even considering the different timezone the trader is in, and the different broker time, there is no trade...

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I think the ribbons made him take that trade. Just look at the way the colour red or whatever that colour is crossed the green one from up to down My 2 cent Waiting for the beautiful thread creator to throw more light on the proper use of Ribbons in this system

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Blanca, Hoping your mother is improving and in good health. Thank you for this system, I am reading the thread since the last year,2019, and following up silently. Thanks for sharing with others helping them to be successful. In this thread, I am looking to knowledge so we are waiting for the most important part in my point of view. TF 5 minutes is noisy, so we need more knowledge to more filter fake signals ( I didn't try the system and don't know if CCI and Double CCI is enough ), please tell us more about ribbons , sometimes I see ribbons in grey and sometimes in green, sometimes wide sometimes narrow. we need more knowledge as if we got more knowledge pips will come after. Thanks, omr

--- 帖子 #471 ---
What are the "ribbons" ? Is it the blue arrow or green arrow in this screenshot? Can anyone post a summary of the rules?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Post 94

--- 帖子 #473 ---
It is not clear what she is referring to as "ribbons". Can you answer my question regarding the green and blue arrow?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Why is no signal there?All the conditions are met...

--- 帖子 #475 ---
If you keep the original threshold , 30 bars needs to pass SINCE the last one to originate a new signal..., in you pic the last one was 6 bars back..... watch the cci yellow line, that's the trigger

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Does anyone know what I did wrong on this signal?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
How about this one? Where did I go wrong on this one?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Your signal was on 3 or 4 candles befor your trade. On the last screen i think that you Should filter out trades like this cuz of ribbons. It was too close to ribbons edge. But looks like even in that trade you can make 1xATR TP. It depends on your money management As for me - i have no skill to scalp with this system. High TFs are easier to handle

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Blanca, how can I download your system? Thank you.

This is my first post, although working in forex for almost 5 years, I am used to working on d1 and w1 TF, I am trying to move to smaller TF and found this blanca strategy interesting and decided to start analyzing entry, exit, targets and stoploss by analyzing Higher TF and try to eliminate false signals in smallers TF. The picture shows the ideal conditions to the rules of entry and exit. Sorry, for my English Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #491 ---

--- 帖子 #492 ---
At this moment i dont see any entry for now, the trend is up in 5m but you dont have the basic rules to entry and exit

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Happy new year. I'm trying your system. I hope to have a good start

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Why not use stop loss according to the system rules. Only then are you able to prove that the system is working for you.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
My thought is to lower your risk and widen your stop loss. When eyeballing these movements, for me it looks like trailing with the heavy pink moving average of the second fastest ribbon allows breathing room for a longer movement. Of course that's just one of many options for SL.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Yeh system loves bigger SL thats for sure. And more thing, i suggest to wait a minet after signal, in 60% times pullback is coming right on the next candle

--- 帖子 #497 ---

Hi everyone, having gone through the entire trail of posts in 1 sitting, may I first of all take the opportunity to thank Blanca for starting this thread and offering her time and energy to help other "failing" or "newbie" traders for FREE. Our heartfelt prayers are with her and her dear mother at this crucial time and we pray for her speedy recovery. People in this group need to appreciate what others have done and are currently doing to help us "failing" "newbie" traders. There are some on here that are attempting to poison the atmosphere in this group by their distasteful comments. If you dont think this system is for you, then that's perfectly fine. Can you please keep your opinions to yourself and JOG on to look for your next "holy grail". We would prefer not to have you in here for any negativity. A special and wholehearted gratitude of thanks and appreciation to SICK 35 AND MY PROFIT coding the scanner. I have not loaded any of the templates, indi's or scanner yet, as i've just about finished reading all the posts, but I will do so tomorrow. Im sure it will be amazing, given what I have read on here. Both Sick35 and My profit have a done a wonderful job in creating this scanner which will no doubt ease the life of many traders in this forum and without their hard work and dedication, this would not have come to fruition. Everyone of us in this forum needs to acknowledge this and thank them for it. Its people like Blanca, Sick35 and My Profit that make the world a better place than it is, and the more we appreciate them and thank them for it, the more we will benefit from their wisdom and knowledge. Having said all that, I will post regularly once I am set up and wish you all a very pipsolous new year !! APOLOGIES : OUR SINCEREST THANKS AND APPRECIATION TO BACKSPIN FOR HIS CONSTANT CONTRIBUTION AND COMMUNICATION WITH SICK35 in helping to create the scanner and I humbly apologise for omitting his name. My heads dead at this time of night !!

Hi forex baraka, I really fail to see where anyone has attempted to 'poison the atmosphere by their distasteful comments". The negativity you may perceive as such, is that of those traders that are just frustrated. Nothing more, nothing less. It's typical. People see a trading system, get excited, place a few trades and there enthusiasm is greeted with a reality that is different. I suggest you download the indi's and templates and trial the system before going too heavy on some of the respondents who have really just made comments out of frustration. In my opinion, applying any trading system without knowledge of market structure/price action is a dangerous occupation. There has been little discussion between those active on this thread, except for the scanner and from a trading perspective, those that have mainly experienced a negative reality. Maybe, if everyone got together on this thread and shared their experiences you could all work it out. The system is in front everyone..... Good trading to everyone.

wisdom of the crowd what about making a first collective evaluation? all those, who think, they have understood the system so far, should publish all their trades, here the winning ones and the losing for the individual trader not too many lines, but all together some pattern should be detectable. badeel has already pioneered in this direction. 1. deciding which points are relevant for useful statistics; for example market - time frame -definition of signal - size - qualification of entry (perfect, too late, too early, market, limit, slippage)- duration- way of exit (market/limit/stop/slippage) - result 2. collecting the individual data = publishing here, everybody is invited to do so, but everybody taking part should declare himself, whether he is sure to have understood the system so far or whether he is still in a learning phase 3. generating an aggregate result perhaps the result helps to turn the hardest frustrated pessismist into a constructive optimist

Hello friends, because we are waiting for "the final" instructions from Blanca, and this thread to me is important, I'm going to put some info about the CCI (taken from the Net) to help some of you to underestand the funcionality of the CCI and how we can use the double cci signals to our advantage, Remember that Blanca's guideline is to wait for a "cci 200 signal', but we can use also the '100' signal, a little more risky, but we can get more signals. Note; we are awaiting for Blancas "final" guidelines.. Ok..let's see.... CCI trading 1 - CCI is in an overbought zone.(Just above 100). The moment it entered there, we could have placed a Buy order, since we know that a strong uptrend has been established. 2 - CCI rises to an extremely oversold level, this is where we know that the reversal is near, so the measures are to tighten our stop loss and either exit as we spot a reversal pin bar candlestick or wait till CCI exits below 200. 3 - The moment CCI exits +200 zone we should close all remaining Long trades and look to Sell. With CCI exiting from an extremely overbought zone is a perfect opportunity to initiate our first Short trade. Note:Maybe we can wait until the "next" -100 signal to appear?? At the same time, should we never witness CCI above 200, we'll be still holding our Buy position open, because CCI continues to trade inside an overbought zone. (So, the difference is whether there was a rise above 200 or not. If we erase #2 event from the chart, we're trading in an overbought zone and continue to hold out Long position). 4 - As price exits from an overbought zone, we close all Long positions and can immediately open Short positions / add to existing Short trades opened at point 3. Or wait for the -100 signal. 5 - CCI crosses its Zero line and now is on Seller's territory. We can open yet another Short trade. Or wait for the -100 signal. 6 - Price enters an oversold zone (below -100), which tells us that a downtrend is already running strong. We can add up to a Short trade and hold till we find that CCI rises back above -100. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CCI and its Zero line An aggressive way to enter the market is to react to CCI's line crossing its zero level. When CCI moves above Zero, traders would Buy the currency expecting a newly changed trend to hold. Vice versa, when CCI falls below zero, traders would Sell looking to benefit from early signals of an emerging downtrend. Simple rule: Above zero - Buyers' territory, below zero - Sellers' territory; unless, we have reached an oversold/oversold zone. Remember, use this info ONLY in a Demo account to try...Together with the Ribbons, Pivots and the Magnificent Indicator from Sick35 can be great.... Blanca, if you think this info is not appropriate to show in your thread, tell me to erase it... Saludos...

MyProfit Your indicator look very good and profitable, can you share it for all of us?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
It is a standard CCI with settings of 34 broken up into areas of 100. MyProfit has applied coloured highlights to improve the display. MyProfit has provided some good informational material on the basics of CCI usage. fxzones, it is an indicator that reflects price. Price leads the CCI, it feeds it. I would not use it alone without price structure or other verifying indicators.

Great update! I cant modify my CCI indi in this way (MT4) =(

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I don't think it's necessary to modify the CCI. Just study the past screenshots, especially CCI crosses from + - 200 and 0 crossing also and the colours within the CCIs. Going back to the ops basic explanation of the rules is also a good idea also. And ones you master this, you will be green all week

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi, Blanca, how are you. Trust we are all doing well. Let's move forward on this system.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi guys, So nice to be here again, sorry for the big delay but well I am finally back, lets keep trading starting next week ok. My mom had two heart attacks in one month and her kidneys stopped working so I kind of spend a whole month in the hospital and some very tough days but she is much better now at home, already walking and already arguing with me so I guess she is improving a lot, also eating like a pig. Thank you very much for all your kind words, seems we still have some instructions to deliver in order to make this work, again very kind of you guys and lets keep on working together and having fun. Life is good sooo good even 1 minute alive is nice and trading is amazingly cool so lets do it guys, enjoy your everning and see you soon. XOXO

Good day everybody, After the Presidents day, today only the indexes had some good moves, lets see tomorrow if we can catch something. Let me put up my charts and we can start, see u soon and enjoy your day, Blanca.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Thanks Bianca I was able to make some pips today compared to yesterday which I was unable to take any trade.De 30 made my day.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
This was a trade I took earlier today on CHFJPY. Followed blanca's rules. BUY ORDER - Price was outside the upper side of ribbons - DOUBLE CCI was approaching 200 and about to cross. - Yellow Line on Double CCI was almost vertical - Received a signal immediately after I put in a BUY. (Kinda predicted it would happen. But followed rules.) - Price stayed above ribbons. Ribbons were small and tight. Which blanca suggested is good because ribbons acted as support on the way up. Enter: 111.905 Take Profit: 112.496 Loving the system for sure. That's quite a lot of pips just from following the rules. For anyone that wanted to know if the system works when you follow it to the T. Yes, it does

Keep trying... testing some adjustments to this system...

Hello my dear friend Initially, I will be presenting this music to you from spotify.com . https://open.spotify.com/track/7qaYUy09Lnf5MAxLLMj1fO Attached Image (click to enlarge) You wrote very, very beautifully.

I am glad From your generosity your kindness Please always be kind With respect .

Hello Blanca and all members, I am newbie with Forex, and trading, I want to learn with you guy. I loaded file from page 3. My template not shows the ribbon, help me pls. how can I fix it. Best regards, Suchart

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hello Alls, I am fixed. Best Regards, Suchart

Hi, I went long at the red line..am i following this system correctly? thanks

--- 帖子 #527 ---
To me, Yes, but as you can see, if you entered before,see picture, your trade will be more profitable... Watch the ribbon, green. between yellow lines, try to enter at the start of the confluence and direction of that two ribbons, the green with magenta (wider) is the trend, the green with gold (thin) is the entry when the cci is above 100 or 200 if you prefer it... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Thank you for taking your time to reply. It makes more sense to me now. In the pic attached, would that be a short, if not why? because i see the wide ribbon is showing downtrend and the thinner one is turning down too, the cci is below -100..Thank you again

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Let me try to explain.. I'm not a expert on this system, but I can see some guidelines... I suppose the red line is the entry? No real separation(lime bars) on the thin ribbon, no momentum... the yellow line (200)? is flat, maybe slightly going up? the third ribbon, (sea green-violet],on the back,goes up,in this is case showing up a higher trend,is up And because of that, to me, it is a bad trade..

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thank u

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi How can I change the thickness and color of indicator 'Trend CCi' I tried but could not save. Same default appearing. Also I am getting error 'Error - Chart period is greater than 1 day.' when I switch to W1 or MN Thanks in advance for the support. Mohan

--- 帖子 #532 ---
You can't , the settings are coded "inside" this exe file, and this kind of file can't be modified Tell me what colors and thickness you want, maybe I can do something.... Maybe other indicator, not in Blancas system is the culprit...

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Np The Error is common for all charts/system, it's MT4 issue I think Thank you

--- 帖子 #534 ---
come back！i need 捏额度有 you

poltergeist, ha desaparecido el hilo de la noche a la mañana, lo nunca visto...un fin de semana pagado en el caribe al que explique lo que ha pasado con este hilo...

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hello y'all, It's been awhile and we haven't heard from bianca. I hope all is well? especially in this period. and i hope y'all are staying safe. Well after much wait, i bumped into this thread ( https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-trading-forex ) and i think we can add the statistics to this strategy and learn from it. I am sorry if i deviates from the topic being discussed here but i think we can look into it pending when bianca's updates. I know some of you might have bumped into it too but still i chose to share incase someone might not see it. Disclamer: The thread i shared above is NOT mine and also i have no connection or whatsoever with the writer and members. Education purposes ONLY..
