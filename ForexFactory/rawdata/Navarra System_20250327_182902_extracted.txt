Hello everyone! I have been gone for a long time but am back in the forex game now for about 5 months. I have been doing really well and improving my system daily. pretty soon I will share it with you. As for now I will be posting the trades I will be taking.

The biggest thing I realized in the forex is to go off what you feel is going to happen. Dont jump in on price too early. Truthfully nobody knows where the market is going to go. We can all assume its going to a resistance, daily low, weekly low, fib, elliot wave, support & demand, etc.. When it doesnt we feel like we need another indicator so we can catch every single move. Its absolutely not possible. If it was we would all be rich. Of course we would like to but it takes time and hours and years of dedication. You will have to blow some accounts untill you learn that you dont just trade with instinct. You have to be patient. I have turned $500 in to $35,000 in 7 weeks only to get greedy and lose it all. Yes, thats right. I didnt walk away with any of it :/. I never trade demo. Everything I do is live. You have to feel the money you earn and the money you lose. The market is a gamble and the ones who play safe and smart will walk away with pretty good money.

Anyway, for right now I am short on Aud/jpy. target#1 90.467 target #2 90.267

Something to remember is to not trade anything shorter than 15 minutes. I trade daily, 4hr,1hr charts only. My main chart is 4h. Daily shows me where the trend is. 4h is showing me what price is doing and where it might go. When i see a good trade on 4 hr i might go to 1h and see if I can get a better position. I use pivot points for exits.  If you want to make money and not be fooled by fakes and spikes trade 4h timeframe only! also exit when I see TDI go flat or my dashboard go the opposite direction.

I place all my trades at 1:00am est. This is a good time to see where market is going to go for the night. Stop loss should be 60 pips. If you get in around the right time you wont need more than that. I usually keep my trades open untill 11:00 am the next day. Unless we are at a strong pivot level and I see indicators turning on me I will exit. Usually the market picks up more juice after 9:30 so I dont like to close trade till lunch time since thats when volume decreases and market ranges.

GBPAUD Short signal

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Looks like AUD/JPY is finally starting to move down after some retracement up. shorted Thursday also and closed friday and tonight placed some more shorts. Still holding off for GBP/AUD till about 1:00

Sometimes Sundays are very tricky. You can have all the right signals and the market will move against you or not move at all. I only trade Sundays when I see an absolute Perfect set up. We will see if the market is nice tonight

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Just staying with AUD/JPY. Shorts are in progress and take profit will be between s3 and weekly s1. Time to go to bed. Good night everyone.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you for sharing your system but you dont show your indicators list also can you please give your template  your system look nice and promising

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I think he covered that on the first post!

." I have been doing really well and improving my system daily. pretty soon I will share it with you....."

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Nothing new there except for a hell lot of indicators.  Really like to see the trades

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Good morning traders! Closed trades from last night because Sunday night trades are tricky like I said in earlier posts and monday mornings usually scare me so I took profit at S2 line instead of waiting for my take profit to be hit.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
This system is nothing new. I basically took indicators that worked and put them together. I like having a little more indicators so that when they all match up I know im in a good trade. When one of them if not going with the others I dont trade. Picture below shows why I exited and I also placed a short on GBPUSD this morning

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Seems like GBPAUD might be coming down later today. Still not to sure but GBPUSD seems like it might be exploding to the downside

--- 帖子 #12 ---
System was pretty accurate on this one

--- 帖子 #13 ---
With news coming out at 9:00 am est looks like it could be good for the Dollar. Trading news is always scary but if the system is showing all signals going the right way 85% of time it doesnt matter. Right now its showing GBPUSD is going down

TARGET 1.52904

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Price should hit 200 ema on one hour chart. Might take profit there and play it safe. Couple more minutes

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Sell signal on NZDUSD!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I try not to get greedy so as of right now staying with GBPUSD only. Sometimes greed takes over and as a trader you need to control it.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Taking a little longer this morning but I am still short. Some of you who trade 5 min or 15 min chart could of been fooled with the movement up :/. If it does end up going up then I got fooled

All indicators are still down on 1h chart. Lets see if the market gets some juice at 9:30

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Be patient, it looks very good. I look forward to testing your system .. When are you planning to do publish the entire system with indicators and template?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
showing why I was still in trade.

As you can see a couple posts back I said the system showed a sell on NZDUSD. Would of been a nice trade also to get in but wanted to stay with just one this morning

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Where you see the check mark would of been where I entered. Trade was signaled there. Too bad I wasn't greedy this morning. Missed out on some extra cash...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Sorry but a thread has no point at all if rules and indicators have not been posted.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Indrek, You don't have to be on this thread. I said soon I would post it. If you don't have patience then you can go to another thread.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I am still working on System and don't want to post something thats not a 100% complete. Right now im posting my live trades. Some of the indicators I use you can see on the charts. Nothing is hidden.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Closed on gbp usd about 5 minutes ago for 80 pips. Market is boring right now

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Dont usually trade at this time but it looks like NZD/USD might be down for the day. Good signals on daily chart and TFI crossing on 4hr and daily.Taking profit on 200ema on one hour chart. Everyone have a good day. I'll be back tonight to trade some more.

I

--- 帖子 #26 ---
i will post indicators and template soon

. Let me improve it more and show you guys the way i trade live. If you dont want to follow you don't have to. I have worked hard on this system and have made and lost lots of money in forex. Be patient and good things will come. There is no get rich over night system or strategy that i am presenting or that anyone else has. Good day!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Just to show last trade I am in and where my take profit line is. A little above 200ema where the daily low is. Like to post all trades so nobody thinks im lying. Many people posts setups that they were in but you don't see the pips and money they are making. To each his own but I want to show you guys the losses and profits. I trade forex full time but also have my own business so my hours can be a little crazy. Off to work

--- 帖子 #28 ---
It's always good to have someone on the thread who jumps from system to system trying to find an easy way out. As I said before. You don't have to be here. I'm sure you're making plenty of money on your own. I believe you have your own thread right? Why don't you stay there and teach

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Ok man. Your trades are looking good. I'm waiting for more. Show us what you have got.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I'm trying oghix. It's a little annoying when certain people expect to get everything handed to them right away. Never said I wasn't sharing the system. I'm just getting the feel of publishing my trades again and feeling out the system of how t explain once I post everything. Not really someone who comes in forums and talks. I felt like its a good time now to do it. Step 1 is showing my trades. Step 2 will be to post system and evolve together.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks for the compliment oghix

--- 帖子 #32 ---
interesting system,waiting...

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Anyone who can turn $500 into $35k in 7 weeks has my full attention. Count me in.   Thanks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
With patience, waiting out of your system.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
This was many years ago with another system. In the end it didn't get me anywhere. I lost 90% of it through greed. You see once you start making really good money and winning a lot you feel like your system is the best. Then you place trades at all times and feel like you can't lose. With confidence comes greed. Eat a little at a time and you will do better.

Thats why im trying to teach and learn patience. Anyone can make money in forex. It's the ones that can keep it that are good. Im still learning...

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Again i typically dont trade during these hours but I have been short on NZDUSD and AUDUSD.

With news coming out later on on NZD and AUD I feel like it will price down to weekly R1. If news wasnt till the AM hours I would not be in any trades

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Enzo,

I like the Top Trending Pairs indicator. Did you get that here in FF? You don't have to share it if you don't want to, just looks really good. I wish you the best of luck in your system and will continue to follow. Thanks for taking the time to share with us.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
If I end up losing these trades its because I didnt follow my own rules. Sometimes its difficult. Its always up to you as to how risky you want to be. These are the market hours when price doesnt move and just bounces around so singnals are not always that accurate. Since I have been in trade since 10:45am (still part of trading time) I figured I would let it ride and see what happens rather than closing for a loss.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I do want to share everything my friend. Honestly im just trying to get the feel for all this again. IM not that good at putting all indicators and templates together either. Im just a trader and trade alone without anyone elses help or advise. I dont share things with others or post indicators so im really not that good at it. I have been working on putting everything together for everyone. That is the fx reactor indicator. You can get that at forexwinners.net. I set mine to 4h period rather than Daily

--- 帖子 #40 ---
The reason why I dont get caught up in threads also is because there are always so many opinions. People take the system you have and add to it, delete indicators, and change it till its no longer the same.

Examplae last week I decided to come on FF and check out what people thought about a certain pair I was skeptical about. I wanted to buy but everyone kept saying to short. I read and read and everyone was shorting. SO I jumped on a made myself believe it was short. I ended up losing 80 pips  When I wanted to buy. Thats where forums will play with your head a little. Thats happened several times.

Dont get caught up in what anyone else is doing or saying including myself. Trade what you see not what you hear. If I say its going price is going down and you dont see it or your system doesnt agree dont trade!

Dont pick tops and bottoms either because thats impossible. You might get lucky a couple times but you wont last long.

Ok guys as promised. I made it as quick as possible and I dont even know if it will work since it was my first time doing this.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thanks for your generosity Enzo.  Will study this over.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Still holding shorts on NZDUSD and AUDUSD  was down about a 15-20 pips each trade but its starting to show some life now that we are getting closer to the news and market hours. Hoping this goes my way because I hate being in trades around this time. However, there is some yen news coming out later tonight that I might trade if I see some good signals.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
enzo, I am IN! I could not open your rr file. can you send it in exe file please?

Whats your TP on aud and nzd/usd??

--- 帖子 #46 ---
What do you mean?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
You might want to consider getting the free RAR extract Frog program (one place is http://downloads.yahoo.com/software/...ct-frog-s40407).  Its very easy to use and free - I've been using it for several years to extract rar files.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #49 ---
If the news comes out negative for NZD and AUD I believe then that NZD/JPY and AUD/JPY will continue going down. Signals now are just showing a retracement. Could have some more movement down.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Stochastic 14,3,5,

down on daily for both AUDUSD and NZDUSD. Its looking good!!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Moving in my direction

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Well, NZD is weak and turned out weak like I said earlier and the system pretty much showed me what the news would be. Yen pairs are still strong so i sold NZDJPY

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Now thats what you cal;l a fake out from the big dogs. I was up total 185 pips and then it went down to up 3 pips. Had me worried there for second but stayed on 4 hour chart. currently back up a total of 53 pips. Lets see what happens. Market is acting strange with news and markets opening up

--- 帖子 #54 ---
In about 10 minutes we should be seeing some nice movement

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Closed out all trades. Market is getting close to all targets and I feel like this is the time movement tends to bounce and retrace a little. Will wait till 1am for next trade

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Actually nevermind. Market seems to be moving  lot tonight and dont want to miss anything. Buy order on gbp/nzd and sold NZDUSD. Has more room to go

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Jumped on the trade because of news event. This should be last one till later on. Will close trades soon and wait

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I see that there's a lot of new guys on this thread. I just want to tell you guys forex is not easy. Theres lots of hours and patience involved in it. In order to win you have to lose. You have to feel the market and no the ins and outs. Nobody can explain how the market moves or why it does such things. Its like a tornado or hurricane. This is not the holy grail. The trader is the one who makes the system. You the trader have to be responsible and patient. You have to not get greedy. Be ready to have your wife or girlfriend yell at you all the time that you're always on the computer like mine does. She doesn't mind when I buy her things from the money I earn but I always here her nagging about how much time I stare at squiggly lines as she says. My hours sometimes are all messed up from staying up late and waking up early for the market. It has to be worth it for you. I can say I honestly love it. Its like a drug to me. Even when I lose I cant stay away. Respect the forex and know its power and then you can actually win some. When your new you have no idea about it. You think its just up for a while and down for a while. Sounds easy. Ride along whichever way its going. I wish...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Closed out trades for 100 pips. Sorry I couldnt post pic I closed trades right when it hit R1 and price was moving too fast so didnt want to give any back to market. Price should retrace a little now since it touched fib and we will see around 1 what we will trade. Not a bad day

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Nzdjpy looking like a good sell.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi enzo2325.Thank you for sharing your system and indicators.Can you tell please where can i find info about those indicators?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
What would you like to know?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I would like to know the indicators better and how to read them.Thank you

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Well, its pretty simple. You are going to have to do some trading to realize what they do. Watch the charts when you get signals and you will see how they behave. I posted charts for you to study as well. Google the indicators and you should get your definition of what they are. They are pretty self explanatory. I keep a fast macd and a slower macd on bottom. Probability indicator are with my settings and shows signals. Dashboard is set to 1h chart and 4h. must match for it to be valid. Im use two TDI's. One is 4 hr and the other is Daily. Try to trade in same direction as daily. Signal line is the deep colored line thats purple and green. If taken trade line must be same color and going in that direction. Profit goldeneye is one of my favorites and i changed settings. Took me couple weeks to get it right.

Marcelms could you post all idicators and your template for this system as those posted by enzo2325 don't work for me?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
since you manage to set you platform....could you please post indies and template?

i read you previuos post...and download it...but it seems that it is not all there

thanks

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I have downloaded the original navarra zip file and i instaled in Mt4 platform in experts/indicators folder.Then i instaled the Fx reactor wich it seems to be an EA but it works as an indicator also.Read the PDF file from the folder

--- 帖子 #79 ---
My chart looks like this!! I cant find Hma Color and Hma arrows!! Also not like yours??

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Did you instaled the indicators from Navarra zip file?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
yes sir. I did with all these arrows, But its ok. I am happy with what i got! LOL Now I am long gbp/usd, and aud/usd n short eur/aud and usd/jpy.as per the latest trend arrows on h1 chart.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Navarra zip file is not zip. It is an ex4 file so what idicators am I supposed to install? Could anybody tell me that? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
It,s not a zip it,s rar and you have to open it with Winrar program form there you extract the indicators and instal them Good luck

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Was everyone able to get it working?

Last nights trades went ok. Nzdjpy went my way but missed my take profit by 20 pips so didnt pull as much out as I wanted. GBPNZD didnt so that was a losing trade but still came out profitable.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Yes you would of sold at the first red bar to the weekly pivot

--- 帖子 #86 ---
USDCHF Beautiful sell signal!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Looks like news for dollar will be good?? NZDUSD is setting up for a buy

GBPNZD is setting up for a sell.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Now this is the time you want to see where price is on 4 hour and whats its doing but place trades on 1 hour. Be patient!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
With news about to come out price will always go against your trade if you placed any. I still believe usdchf will go down even though it rose up about 25 pips right now. Trading news isnt always safe but I have a pretty good streak with this system where news doesn't affect it.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
nzdusd has resistance with the daily R1 and 60MA  you can see on 4 hours its still an uptrend. Also above 200 ema

4 bars couldnt break below R1 or 60ma

--- 帖子 #91 ---
5 minutes till the moment of truth. Could go either way but im hoping up. GbpNzd has all signals down and usdchf  please please go my way

--- 帖子 #92 ---
How are you enzo2325, Your strategy is more like mine. Innitially I thought you piped into my trading plateform to copy my strategy. I just added the CI(circular indicator).I acctually took all the trades you took this morning.I trade it on 28 currency pairs on daily chart trading 30mins a day.

The major thing you need to know is when to take profit, because once in the month the market shot up in your direction with 10-15% profit on your account when trading 1% of the account, the best thing to do is to take your profit once on all trade and don't be deceived that the price will continue in that direction.

I am still mastering it too and developing it to make it more profitable than it is.I will come back next 2 weeks when I am less busy.

Successful trading.

cheers!!!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Closed out with a loss. Market was acting too crazy and didnt want to risk more

--- 帖子 #94 ---
more room to go down and got on board

Those losing trades were my fault. Signals on 4 hour werent confirming 100% and fx reactor showed the dollar being strong the entire time. Foolish loss and wont be trading that way again.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
USDChf was the only chart the had all indicators going down but with the dollar showing signs of strength and being stuck on daily s1 shouldn't of taken trade. Both macd were up on daily as well. Traded from my phone this morning and not charts

Glad that they are similar!

Yes I take profit at pivot levels and emas. the take profit is not really a concern for me since there are so many places to take profit in the system. Its up to you as to where you want to. If you want to go to a further pivot then its a little more risky.

The trade on usdchf was a trade that was taken off my iphone metatrader platform that all I have is a stochastic set up on it. Pretty foolish of me to do so. Once I was in trade wanted to see if It was right. Last time i trade from phone.

Interested to see what you bring to the table. ttys

Now is a good time to stay out of market. If you want to trade sydney or Tokyo close trades at 9 before they retrace. Then come back on at 12:45am and look for next set up to place at 1am

theres some good news tonight to make the market move. Look for set ups around 6pm est

Hello, I am actually testing your system but I have a little problem with the FX reactor indicator it doesn't shows the fonts even if I installed the fonts that was in the rar file.

Can someone help me ?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I don't know it worked for me right away. Try restarting your platform. Also don't have any other indicators to close to fx reactor.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Of course its not. Because if it was you wouldnt be posting this system lol. But its good you're honest in saying you have made money but also loss alot of money with this system.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
To be honest I do really well with this system. I didn't have to share it or need to share it to prove anythjng. Since I took things from other systems and learned a bit here and there I wanted to give back. In the trades I posted you can see how many pips I make in a week. The system is really good and gives me a good income but its up to the trader to make the right move.

I have lost lots of money but that was with my old strategy years ago with only Emas and fibos. This system I keep 80% and that's only because I'm still learning. I've been trading it for 6 months. I have to control myself more to up the winnings. I don't blame systems. I blame the trader. The system gives u a visual.

mu last system wasnt enough. I didn't have enough visuals of prices. I believe with this one I have everything I need to see where it might go

--- 帖子 #105 ---
does ur broker have all 28 pairs ?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
The system super.Razobralsya.Mozhno even work on M15.Thank you very much Enzo!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Yes that wasn't a problem.

But I manage to make it works fine. I think that the fonts weren't installed correctly I just had to reinstall the fonts and restart my computer.

Thanks for the help !

--- 帖子 #108 ---
If you look at GBPNZD on 4H chart its a sure sell signal with daily tdi getting close to crossing. Keep an eye on it.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
NZDJPY on daily looks like it still wants to go down. Who know how much more but if traded close at the nearest pivot Which would be the daily S2

GBPNZD if I would sell would be taken profit at DAILY S1 since there is major resistance there

--- 帖子 #110 ---
GBPJPY would sell to S3  look at charts on 4H and daily so you see what I see

--- 帖子 #111 ---
The RAR file has the "Dynamic Trend" indicator as shown in the screenshots, but not the "Daily Dynamic". Could you upload this one as well? Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yes when I get home later

--- 帖子 #113 ---
GBPNZD has gone down about 50 pips. For those of you who took that trade when I called it a couple hours ago good for you. I couldn't be by computer so missed it.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Enzo,

I can relate with all you have said so far: hooked on Forex, life is messed up with the addiction, can't stay away, lost a lot and yet very optimistic. Will follow your thread closely and hope to have things turn around finally.

Keep up your good work.

Best wishes for your thread.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
here you go

--- 帖子 #116 ---
NZDUSD and NZD JPY Look like they still have rooms to go down. Daily TDI is down strong.

GBPNZD is acting weird. When NZDUSD goes down it al;ways goes up. Also EURNZD has risen nicely and GBPNZD always moves in sync with it sometimes faster. All signals show to see gbpnzd which is confusing since price is about a couple hundred pips away from eurnzd. If anything it should rise with all the news coming out for the pound

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Trades set for nzdusd and nzdjpy. Sold both and taking profit at daily s2

DIdn't wait till 1 because I felt I got in at a good price off the 15 minute chart. Yes I went that low for entry price to try something different and going to see how it plays off.

Also heres a little trick I do. Weekly I withdraw money if I have a winning week. I take out a good 95%. Heres why... If I leave it to let account grow I tend to place too many trades and losing trades are not felt as much because there is more money in account. So, by having less money in account I trade smarter. I try not to lose as much and definitely dont trade with as many lots. Its a strategy that has been helping me. Sometimes being down 60 pips on a couple different pairs and seeing -$700 could be a little scary. There were times in the past I would be down -$2000 and would s%^t a brick during sleep. So by having less money in account I can control my mindset and I pull out money weekly-biweekly to feel better about trading. It has definitely improved my style from being aggressive to being more cautious and patient.

Thanks Enzo!!

Well woke up this morning and took profit on both trades

I took AUDNZD short last night at 1.13109 when all the indy's lighted up red. Was surprised to see this morning though that my b/e stop (set at 1.13099 after +20 in profit) got hit at 8:29am EDT even though the high was only 1.1294 at the time? The only conclusion I can think of is the spread widened so much that it spiked to the 1.13128 that it closed me at -- even though FX Reactor was on and should have prevented it (max spread=5, max slippage=3). It's Demo so doesn't mean anything, but a learning moment for when I go live.

On the other hand, went short GBPUSD as well +126 at the moment.

Awesome job!

Its the market this week. Its been acting really crazy with all the news and non farm coming out this week. The big players are messing around with all of us. I have not been making as many pips as usual. I usually wake up and am up almost 200 pips on pairs. This week the highest I been up is 60-70. Not much for so much news going on. Its best for the rest of the week to take profit at the closet pivot or ema when you get a siganl. If I would of done that with eurusd and gbpusd  this morning I would of been golden.

Full of indicators that work

--- 帖子 #128 ---
EUr usd having a hard time breaking through monthly R1 and daily R1 from july 24 to present. I still feel like its going to come crashing down this week. Gbpusd is down so should the EURO!!! This week is nuts

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Your macd settings are the same and you're missing the signal line 12,26,9 are good setting but you should have a faster macd setting as well

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Well took a loss with eurusd.

hopped on gbpnzd and made some back

--- 帖子 #131 ---
First of all i am thankful to enzo2325  for introducing very good system on this forum, especially for new comers, regarding EUR/USD please correct me if i am wrong, the all conditions were not met means candles were in uptrend above 200 and 60 ema, so we should be in direction of trend. 2nd question i am unable to manage 16 pairs charts in single terminal, my terminal often got stuck, please suggest what to do to veiw all pairs?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
You are absolutely correct about eurusd. Since gbpusd was trending down and eur was and dollar has been strong all week I figured it would come down to meet gbpusd. That was my own dumb fault.

You cant have too many charts open or your computer will slow down. I only open 3 charts at a time and find the best 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
For those of you who like to scalp. You can drop down to the 15 minute chart and change the bottom MTF Tdi to 60minutes. Then trade in the way of 60 min tdi. Respect the 60 ema and 200 ema on 15 minute chart! Always find out main trend though on daily and 4 hour

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I dont usually scalp but this method works too around this time. IM bored so trying to do something with my time till I have to leave.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
"Around this time" Exactly when? Around 3 or 4pm Eastern time? When the market is slow? Till when? When the Asia market starts to pick up? Maybe around 9 or 10 pm Eastern time?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
You can see from the time I posted my charts the time. I don't usually trade those times between 1:00 and 5:00

Scalping is up to you. I don't recommend it because the time is slow like you said but for the scalpers you could do as you please.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
enzo2325, first of all thanks for posting this great looking system which seems like it will take a lot of guesswork out of trading.

couple  questions... can i ask how you rotate 3 charts at a time? is it a matter of manually opening the charts and applying the template to each or is there a script/shortcut?

also, i noticed you have multiple entries for each pair (i think - judging from the chart profit displays on top right) - can you elaborate more on this?

finally how many trades do you get on average over a week?

many thanks again man

--- 帖子 #138 ---
You are very welcome.

I don't know what you mean by rotate. All the indicators take a lot of cpu and can crash your platform. I open 3 different pairs and see which charts I like. Then I keep one open and open 2 other charts and keep going till I find 3 charts that look like good trades. You can have up to 5 charts I just choose not to.

I open up multiple lots because I take profits at different areas. That way I can close with profit to protect myself and let the others run.

With this system I get a trade everyday. Depends on you if you want to go against the trend when trading hours die down or take retracement trades which I don't like to do.

This might be the moment eurusd comes crashing down

Please guide me if i am wrong, As per rules today's trade able pairs are GBPUSD and GBPNZD , we should be looking for the opportunity of short for these two pairs. Is there any other opportunity except these?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Exited EURUSD with a 6 pip loss. Don't know how I feel about it with not having all signals met. Going to take safer trades with all the news.

hi can anyone help>? my reactor looks blank like this, and i cannot resize it to  make it smaller... i have restarted the pc after installing....

Great enzo2325 trades are going in right direction..

what should be the Take profit /Stop Loss for the pairs GBPNZD and GBPUSD? as there are news and European session is also going to started..

--- 帖子 #145 ---
enzo2325 if the other conditions is meet, must d price be above the 60ema and 200 ema b4 you buy?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I had losses on both trades last night from removing an indicator. I removed macd 3,4,10 which showed that gbpusd and gbpnzd were bullish. Its the quicker macd that I have to show quick price change. Also gbpnzd was on 200 ema on daily chart. I dont know whats wrong with me this week but cant seem to focus on trading 100%. News has me a little scared as well and im making bad decisions. I apolgize to all of you. Stick with the template I provided and those of you who took that trade should of called me out and told me that not all indicators were met. Everything has to be 100% matched in order for a trade to be successful. Macd last night told us price was about to reverse.

Bad week for me since I have had some losing trades. Right now im short on NZDUSD ALl indicators are met! Currently up 45 pips

Fx reactor showed me nzdusd was the tiop trending pair to sell

--- 帖子 #147 ---
As I sad earlier during news and big events and the way the market was trying to take everyone out this week its best to take profit at closes pivot. NON farm weeks are always crazy since the big players are trying to gather positions and brokers are taking out everyone's stop losses.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
All conditions met and macd quick settings back on

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Fx reactor cant have any indicators to close to it. Also It looks like your chart is too small fx reactor. What you can do is open fx reacotr on another chart by itself. I don't realize how small charts are with all these indicators on regular pc monitors because my monitor is my 65 inch tv. Everything looks normal lol.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
price is stuck at daily s2. Should blast through it

hard time breaking through

i followed your instruction and here is my profit for the day more is still coming pls confirm this question for me thanks nice system

--- 帖子 #153 ---
jezzzzzz!!!! how many trades place at once?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I removed the 60 ema. I trade with 200 ema now. Yes its best price be above or below.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
great job!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I take profit at different areas to cover and let others run. Once I reach 40-50 pips I take profit on half. Then on next pivot I close out a couple more and leave 2-3 to seee what they do

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Now I closed out 4 positions to protect my self

--- 帖子 #158 ---
In 3 minutes we should get a good push and then im done for the day

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I have 4 trades left open. There is another news coming out in 40 minutes that I believe should push it down more. Debating on waiting

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Target should be weekly s2... currently up 40 pips on each 4 trades

--- 帖子 #161 ---
enzo2325 can you please explain how to decide when & where to place TP and SL? I am using your system since two days it is really productive and beneficial except few trades which were not system fault , which were occurred due to human errors. If you please also suggest which broker is best specially with less spread on all pairs, instant execution.

Thanks to Mr.enzo2325.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
People always make taking profit and exiting a big deal. YOU can take profit wherever and whenever YOU like.

Take profit when:

Price reaches pivot

hits 200 ema

macd changes

fx reactor shows other pair is retracing

TDI crosses

profit goldeney eyeball changes

same goes with exit. ITS ALL UP TO YOU!

THE FURTHER AWAY THE PIVOT FROM PRICE THE HIGHER THE RISK!

IF PRICE IS CLOSE TO DAILY S2 AND YOU WANT TO TAKE PROFIT AT DAILY S3 ITS UP TO YOU BUT RISK IS HIGHER. THATS WHY I PLACE MULTIPLE TRADES SO I CAN TAKE PROFIT AT ALL AREAS AND COVER

I use IBFX they seem ok for right now

--- 帖子 #163 ---
NZDUSD still moving down but man is it taking its sweet time

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Here we go this should be the last push for NZDUSD and then I would advise everyone to not trade anymore till tonight around midnight

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Price seems flat not enough to move market. Closed out +30 pips each 4 trades. Made back last nights loss.

big day tomorrow! Dont really know what the market is going to do. Now thinking about it market might be pretty slow tonight until about 6:00 am tomorrow morning. The only I can tell you is pay close attention to the FX reactor. See what pairs look strong early. If you find a pair you like and the set up looks good switch the FX reactor to chart. That way you can see the strength of that pair early. There has to be a major difference (weaker bar should have no more than 3 bars) to trade.

I will be back on tonight around midnight to see look at charts and possibly find set ups tonight for tomorrow morning. I would advise you guys to download a indicator that hides your stop loss and take profit from broker (stealth ea) for tomorrow. NON FARM is dangerous to trade.

Have a good day everyone.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
ATTENTION!!
i have been saying all week that eurusd gbpusd move in sync. As well as nzdusd/audusd and eurnzd/gbpnzd

The big players have been playing around all week with price and confusing the little people (us) in to not knowing where it will end up.

The Dollar has been strong all week. Should it change tomorrow ? I don't think so. I feel as is the news will be very good for dollar and eurusd will come down and have dinner with his sister! All signs on daily show a beautiful sell set up and im in now! will take my chance.

I have been complaining about this all week and now its time for price and big money makers to prove me right. You guys think what you want but these pairs love to move together. Best trade set up I see is EURUSD!

Here is a daily chart for you to see

You're doing an awesome job!

if you want you can post your set ups here as well and whatever you see that you like so we can brainstorm together. I wouldn't mind that.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
thanks enzo2325

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I see you're on demo. Every system is good on demo  lol

Emotions of trading are taking out when you're not trading live. Its a whole different feel when you see your money in the negative and you sometimes close trades out in the positive too early to not give anything back.

Either way im happy you like it and are doing well. When you go live let me know if you still like it and your results

--- 帖子 #174 ---
yah i used this your in my live account and i was very careless not to turn of the expert advisor and fx reactor took some unwanted trades and blow up my account but i will fund it again next week

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Ya I did the same thing when I first tried fx reactor. You can just uncheck allow live trading on fx reactor and save the template so when you open another template live trades on it are disabled and you can still turn on expert advisor and it will work for other ea's

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I have a little question about your trading times in H4.

What are you saying when you say that you don't trade between  1:00 and 5:00 ? Is it  AM or PM and which Time Zone ?

Thanks in advance

this is another good setup i will trade 2morw if it is valid EURJPY.

1.EUR IS STRONGER THAN JPY

2.THE GREEN LINE IS ABOVE RED IN BOTH THE DAILY AND 4HR TDI

3. DYNAMIC TREND IS GIVING US BUY SIGNAL

4. THE 2 MACDS (THE FAST AND SLOW) IS GREEN

P.S I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TRADE I WILL WAIT TILL 6AM GMT IF IT IS STILL VALID I WILL PLACE ORDERS

This trade could of been taking on the 4th blue bar over the 200ema.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
On this chart you can see PA touch 200 ema and pull back. When PA starts to rise again I would of taken trade because usually the second time it will break through.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
i traded them today and closed them becos i dont like leaving my trades over night it might be hit by news i will still trade them tomorrow if it is still valid

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Careful with TDI if it goes flat or angles off sharp pull out of trade.

GBPJPY tdi daily is still crossed down so it could come back down. That could of been just a retracement. TDI on your chart went flat and PA was showing some doji at monthly pivot. Would of been a good trade to take but with quick profit

--- 帖子 #185 ---
unless that 4hrs tdi comes back down am not taking that trade

A lot of mixed signals this morning. Important factor is fx reactor shows Dollar is very strong. Dangerous to trade around these times since THIS SYSTEM IS NOT MADE FOR NEWS.

You can see the mixed signals but tdi daily is down and 4 hour tdi is below signal line. Bar color is still red and below trendline and signal line. Daily chart has a+ signal for a downtrend. Lets see what happens

Can you please tell us what is your system please ?

Daily still shows Eurusd is going down. If you look at my chart the quickler macd showed price will go up. It did the same thing a couple days ago with gbpusd and gbpnzd. I can start using that method for news. My only problem is daily still shows price will come down. Price just jumped from range day low to hi and now is stuck in between. I feel like its a good time to add more shorts!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Currently down 50 pips a trade but still hasn't hit my stop loss

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Form being down 60 pips a trade am now down only 23. If some of you would of shorted when I said so earlier would of made over 30 pips. I cant trade against daily. Overall trend is down so whatever the big guys are trying to do to scare us it didn't work for me

Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #210 ---
you are welcome

--- 帖子 #211 ---
So 10 minures before you look at the pair and the direction it is going. Based on this you take a trade in the oppisite direction 20 minutes before NFP comes out? Is this it?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
A couple of mistakes I made while on this eurusd trade. Again this system is not a news trading system and Honestly I havent ever traded heavy news. This week was new for me in doing it. I may have caught on to something though. Like I said system is not a 100% yet to me but it did show signs of not to trade and Since I was in trade and in profit I stayed. Next week will be a whole new week, new month, new me.

Example #1

As you can see the quick MACD showed price was going up. I have looked back at many charts during news and this indicator really hits it most of the time. However you see the not all signals matched.

Price hit of 89sma (new one im trying for 4 hour)

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Example #2

Price was at Weekly S1

8/8 murrey math level

Fractal formed

range day low

Also the pair strength was almost equal so It wasn't a good trade to take

--- 帖子 #214 ---
let prepare for next week

--- 帖子 #215 ---
i saw a mixed signal and i ran for life  every mistake is a lesson next week will be better your system is very good just abide to the rules and loss will be nothing to compare to ur profit

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I'm still in trade so haven't lost yet. Daily is still down and big guys spiked price off to sell close to whole number again. Holding position over wknd and next week we should see a nice down side

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Enzo, i've been reading this thread for some time and thanks for your sharing! Im still noob in forex and hopefully can get to trade wisely with your system!

I've setup up everything fine except for one indicator, which is the Daily trend(Dynamic trend). Any idea i can adjust the Daily trend location?Thanks!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Enzo, thanx for the thread.  As for your system, how many lot sizes are you trading?

cheers

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I trade micro lots. A while back I traded 2-5 lots at a time and grew account very quick. Now I trade differently. Smaller and safer. Yes I have to upload the daily still sorry. I will soon.

You can adjust it by the xy position  just play with it and move it wherever you like

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Been trading now for 6 years, and would like to respectfully question the advice given in this post.  Not trying to be argumentative.  Just trying to help traders make money.

Open a 30minute EU chart and go to the July 4, 2013 candle.  This would be the July NFP candle open.  At the open, and immediately after the posting of NFP for the month, the market immediately retraces approximately 57 pips before moving in the NFP direction.  Why 57 pips?  Because that is what was required by the broker kingpins to take out every retail trader stop on the playing field.  Then the market proceeded to advance some 100+ pips in the direction indicated by the NFP announcement.  This month was an exception -- it did not happen.  But more often than not, you will loose with 30 pip SL the strategy suggested.

We must come to understand that the big players are in the business of taking money from retail traders.  I know your broker tells you that he is a "pass-through" broker and does not take positions against you.  But somebody in the food-chain does take a position against you.  Somebody has to because that is what gives you the instant liquidity that fills your order immediately.  Somebody at a market-maker trading desk is trading against you, and he/she knows everything about you.

Trading NFP or any other major FOREX news event is a role-of-the-dice.  Trading FOREX is especially difficult for retail traders, because somebody in the broker/big bank community is trading against you.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
thanks 4 your advice that i said 100pips doesnt mean that i will set up the chart and leave, i will sit and watch it if it goes against me good if it goes my way better. no strategy is 100percent i have been using it and my profit is nothing compared to my loss

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Well put. Everyone has there own strategy and if it works good for them. Trading news is dangerous and risky and especially trading NFP. Eurusd should of gone down today but since it only went up 80 pips it didn't scare me too much. Market went back to a whole number and daily is still looking like a sell. I think they tried to take everyone out of position to gain more for them. Who knows what will happen.

Welcome easyryder!

--- 帖子 #223 ---
enzo2325 thanks and goodnite

--- 帖子 #224 ---
This (in bold type) should be your first sign to STOP immediately trading your current strategy.

On your earlier note of the market moving in the opposite direction 10 minutes before the news release....This is NORMAL but should never be taken as a signal of future price/direction...

The reason why you see this change is that many traders close positions just before release of NFP and others OPEN Positions or place LARGE pending orders. However there can really be no true bias before this release.  Sure once in a while price may react this way, but on which pair???

Did you back test this on 30+ pairs over ALL news releases?  I think not.  Perhaps in the past year on EUR/USD the market reacted this way..But one year of data and 12 NFP releases is really nothing in the big scheme is it?

Still you made pips today on your strategy and I salute you for that   But really look again and be careful.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Enzo thanks for sharing your system.  I am trying to find time here to trial it and look forward to some pips off something new to me.

So far everything installed and running smoothly.  Will look for set-ups on open next week and share as I see them.

Hi ENZO,

Fantastic system and thanks for sharing the same in public.

I subscribe to this thread.

I read the whole thread and installed the system in my computer.

I have 4 hr TDI in place and would like to trade based on 30 min set up next week as I prefer to close the trades on the same day.

Any reason why you open a trade around 1 AM est ?

I know it is the start of third 4 hr candle, but any specific reason other than this ?

I see in your recent charts after 31 st July, you removed 60 EMA but added some other EMA s.

What are those lines ?

Once again thanks for sharing .

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Anytime I place a trade before 1 I go in the negative by over 30 pips. Trading at 1 I get a better entry and those 30 pips can be profit. I re,over 60 ema and replaced it with 89sma

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Enzo,

I have another question, the dash board symbols for RSI, Fast stochastic, slow stochastic is supposed to change its colours based on tie frame I choose. But it does not seem to be changing. I do not know why.

See the screenshot attached for 4hr and 15 min.

This is problem only in Dashboard. The symbols and readings change for different time frames in Probability meter though.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
dashboard setting are set to 1 hour and 4 hour. Its not a MTF indicator. You can set it to two timeframes only

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Your bottom Tdi needs to be set to 1440 daily. They are both reading 240

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Yes, the bottom TDI, I set to 240 and not 1440. Reason I want to trade in 30 min chart based on 4 hr confirmation, Is my thinking right ?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
If I want to trade in 30 min chart based on 4 hr TDI confirmation, what is the best setting for Dash board ?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I dont know never messed with it with lower time frames.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Ok, the basic set up I shall take as per your original set up. I will not change. That is daily RSI + 4 HR fast and slow stochastic for Dash board.

But the only change I shall make is the TDI setting to 60 min. This will enable me to finetune my entry.

Thanks for the clarification.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
NAVK WELCOME

--- 帖子 #246 ---
System is for 4h. The lowest time frame I would drop to is 1 hr with tdi mtf on 240. Any lower timeframe can show a lot of false moves.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Got it. Thanks, I shall go with hourly for fine tuning my entry with TDI setting 240.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Would appreciate if they can share when they find a set up in any pair.

Thanks.

Think the aud crosses (aud/chf, aud/jpy) will come down further this week.

gbpnzd it is at weekly s3 if it breaks out it will be thunderous lets wait and see

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Very interesting thread and awesome system you got here! Thanks for sharing

I don't know much about your approach yet, but I may be using one very similar to yours without all the fancy schmancy stuff. I can understand why you use it, and I agree that the visualization is nice, but it's not necessary if you know how to trade correctly.

One of the advantages an EA/indicator has though is it can process a lot more data faster than a human can. I am a very strong proponent of automated systems, and I am working on one myself, but they can be a real challenge to put together effectively.

Have you posted the indicators and template yet? If so, perhaps you could share which page it is on (or modify post #1 and add it there) so we don't have to search the whole thread. But if your system's not ready yet that's cool too, I understand... I just wanted to give a shoutout to ya either way cuz it looks badass and I'd like to learn more!

Have anybody looked at NZDJPY short ?

Seems to be coming down finally and the daily is still showing signs of down strength. There seems to be no more volume to the upside.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
many thanks enso for system,

my 1st try with this system just sold gbpusd H1@1.5278 stop @last high 1.5310

Please correct me, if it's not good entry

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Post your chart and where you entered please

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Its not a good trade.You have to trade from 4 hour. 4h chart shows no signal of short yet. Dashboard, both macd, candle and fx reactor.

price is over 200ema, 89sma, weekly pivot

risky trade and its Sunday. Market might not move too much tonight. I see it usually moves more for yen pairs and nzd on sunday nights. Higher volatile pairs. On Sundays you have to be very careful with trades because market hasn't picked a direction or trend yet. I would wait till 1am and check 4 hour first.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Yeah I too was wondering how a short trade is possible at this time. As of now it does not show long or short in GBPUSD. See the chart attached.

Max, It can come to pivot point daily if you took short trade, but not guaranteed in my opinion as once europe opens, different scenario.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
here it is the chart. oh thank you for your kind explaination, normally I use m5/m15 to trade, i can't endure for a long-term. i will try to control myself to trade longer. thanks again. oh, your 1am is what timezone? then I ll convert it as mine(GMT+7)

--- 帖子 #264 ---
It could be a good trade to daily pivot but the risk is higher. I always look at 4 hour and don't trade against it

--- 帖子 #265 ---
eastern time. Trade doesn't look that bad because I do feel dollar will be strong soon. Usually price will retrace around 12:15/ 12:30 eastern time. You can still trade 15min chart, Just watch what 4h and daily are doing and if you see the trend is down you take all sells. same as if its up. Its just too much chart watching for me. I like to trade 4H get my signal go to sleep and close it out a little after I wake up.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Good morning looking for sweet trades to take by 6am gmt brb

--- 帖子 #267 ---
FOUND GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #268 ---
TAke as much is u can take from jpy pairs because jpy is strong

enzo2325 have you exited your EURUSD TRADES?

--- 帖子 #270 ---

--- 帖子 #271 ---
If you can post your chart always, it will be useful

--- 帖子 #272 ---
What is your opinion about EUR/AUD, is it right time to sell?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
GBP very strong. Use the nzd weakness today

--- 帖子 #274 ---
enzo2325, Hope you are doing fine. With 0.5% risk per trade on my daily chart trading I made 10% of my account on trades placed last week which I closed about 7hrs ago. Its a great strategy.

Happy Piping.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Good morning everyone!

I am still short on EURUSD since Friday. Its coming down a bit. Surprised the pound rose while the Eur didn't. Seems like they are not in sync again.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Enzo2325 ,Your system is awesome, today i am doing demo and earned 2 % till now without any loss by just following the rules. Just i want to know which session is best to do trade London, Asian or american? because i have observed that after Asian session the JPY,NZD,AUD were strong but later on NZD got weak and GBP gain strength before the begining of london session.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
You can trade all session. I like to trade asian but only for 2 hours. When you get a decent move on JPY,nzd,aud, close out around 9pm est. The market will retrace. London and us are really good times.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Until 10 AM EST, all prices generally retraces, then after 10 AM the price will move in the trend.

Reason is said to be option expiry at 10 AM.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
First chart is 4H and second is Daily

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Yes! I notice around 9:30-10 market gets some juice

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Can any one guide me how to copy chart from MT4 , like above charts. thanks

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi and thanks for all you posted enzo2325! I have the same question, will you share the way it happens? 10x

--- 帖子 #283 ---
right click on your chart click on "save as picture" then select where you want to save it click "save"

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Is this right time to enter in short trade against EUR/AUD or we should wait for tommorow ?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Please suggest is it right time to short EUR/NZD ?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
change the TDI in the last indicator window TO DAILY

--- 帖子 #287 ---
My man! Good job

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Tradibg around this time wont gain many pips. Try Asian session and see if market is moving. Most movement will come at 1am. Also price is above both Emas so might just be a retracement

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Should i set that indicator 1440 with all timeframes? enzo2325 do you check H1 for more precise trading, and why do you stopped exactly at 60ema and 89sma? 10x a lot

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I like 89ema better on 4 hour. Yes. You want to see always what daily tdi is doing to be in a safer A+ trade

--- 帖子 #291 ---
enzo2325, i want to make my risk to reward ratio? can you suggest how do you manage your risk to reward ratio? let say i have 1000 USd account, how many mini lots can i place and what should be SL and TP?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Its all up to you. I don't want to tell anyone how much to trade. It is up to the trader. You can google it and decide for your self

--- 帖子 #293 ---
yea set it to 1440 to filter spikes and false breakout and always trade in the direction of the daily TDI

--- 帖子 #294 ---
here is another sweet pair for long this morning this is just perfect

--- 帖子 #295 ---
AUDUSD

--- 帖子 #296 ---
EURAUD

--- 帖子 #297 ---
wait for full confirmation from the daily tdi

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Sorry that I haven't been posting much. Trading has been pretty boring because I am still short on EURUSD. Price seems to be stuck on a whole number and DailyR1

We could have a double top here. This pair has been so nuts I cant believe it. Is it time for it to come crashing down?? We are about to see

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Cheataddict I think its time for you to go LIVE

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi enzo. What are the settings for the signal line ? Can you post them ?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Default settings

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I'm asking because in my chart is not showing. I think the fault is the the 'SlopeStartPrint" setting which is -1 my case (default). What is yours?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Still short on EurUSD. This is why I don't always do a stop loss. When Im able to be by computer I take the stop loss off and watch for myself. Went down -100 pips on each and looks like now its topping out.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
here you go

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Interesting system, looking forward to the release

--- 帖子 #306 ---
You guys have to read entire thread! Newbies always want quick answers and system. Read the thread and you will find the system.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Yes, i have the same problem. I changed to 0 and line showed, but what this setting really means?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I'm waiting macd and daily dynamic to show more compatible values and make it long? enzo2325 what do you think about that cross? And i want to ask you, which indicators of yours you think are most important to look? Thank you

http://charts.mql5.com/2/214/usdcad-...ex-group-2.png

--- 帖子 #309 ---
That looks like a good trade to me.

Everything is important. It's a whole system. Never trade against daily tdi

--- 帖子 #310 ---
This had to be the most stubborn pair. Finally making a move down. Going to ride it down and break even hopefully. Dollar should be strong everyone. Look at usd pairs only to make big profits. Follow system

--- 帖子 #311 ---
sorry i was not here early this morning to drop some sweet pairs like i use to

Enzo - which of the indi's on your chart is from In$anity Industries ??

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I have no Idea how that even got there or what it is. I can't seem to get rid of it

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi Enzo,

Went through your thread.For probability meter do you look for % also or only SHORT and LONG singal. If you look for % then what % you look for with SHORT and LONG signal?

Regards,

Bedayan

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Its one I still haven't gotten the hang of. I really use it as a last indicator and for a little more confirmation. Its not a BIG indicator in the system

--- 帖子 #317 ---
lets hope for a stronger usd or weaker eur

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Yes! Im still in trade. Was down about 130 pips each trade but held on. Double top has just formed. They rose the price up nice on this one. Should come down now

--- 帖子 #319 ---
If I would of stayed out of NFP I would of been golden this week. Can never assume on news because the big players take price where they want. Its all insider trading and big dog money that move markets. They spread noise and scare the little guys so we will trade in opposite direction. Last NFP I trade. Now I need price to crash on EURUSD. ON EURUSD Price was above 89ema and at a whole number and pivot. Lots of resistance and I still shorted listening to the news. You live and you learn. No more listening to any news and just studying chart

--- 帖子 #320 ---
in EURUSD IF PRICE BREAKES 1.33430 RESISTANCE IT WILL RALLY UP JUST PRAY IT DOES NOT

--- 帖子 #321 ---
THATS THE SPIRIT

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Yup! It has daily r1 there and major resistance. Looking like a double top to me.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Cheataddict keep an eye on GBPAUD. Daily TDI is down. 89 ema would be good target once you get signal of course

--- 帖子 #324 ---
thanks sir i will do just that

--- 帖子 #325 ---
If you shoot down to 1 hour chart you will see there is resistance at 89 ema. If price pat  sses there and you get a signal on 4 hour would be a good trade. Wouldn't expect any signal for another couple hours or later tonight

--- 帖子 #326 ---
USD/CAD gave 60pips today. Very bad news for CAD today also. I think that cross wii continue uptrend about 1.0490-1.0500. It is on the end of the May top right now, if the price close above, at H4, maybe will go up sharply  Sry for my English

http://charts.mql5.com/2/223/usdcad-...orex-group.png

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Good trade!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Gbpaud has made it's way down like I said a little while ago. Eurjpy is looking like its going to fall as well and Euraud which means one thing... Eur and Gbp are going to fall hard finally!! Here we go folks. Strap on tight. Sell eurusd hard like me . Only if u want

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Myra I cut them last night before bed when price retraced. 4 hr was still showing strong. Done trading for the week to regroup for next week. See you guys on Monday. Taking a break from screen.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
closed all trades

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Great, how many pips against each pair?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hello, can you please post your charts to see your entry & exit ? It would be very nice thanks

--- 帖子 #340 ---
i didnt get much pips 30pips and i closed it becos of the news

--- 帖子 #341 ---
i cant do that now because am in a trade now maybe later

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I will post charts later and changes I made to the system. I feel like its more complete and took off the fx meter because of CPU usage and mt4 stalling. It gave nice entry's today and I took them for quick profits. I also have a new trick I will share soon. Testing it out as we speak. Brought in 60 pips already

--- 帖子 #343 ---
wow thats interesting i can wait

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Anyway a littlle trick  that I do is around noon everyday I trade the opposite way of the trend on high volatile pairs. It works pretty good. I caught 70 pips on gbpjpy and 40 pips on gbpnzd and aother 20 on nzpjpy. This one is called lunch time turn around. Everyday a little before noon price retraces because people close profits and the market doesn't have much momentum. Try it out.

Ever get in a trade too early? place the trade in the opposite direction that your trading in before 1am. I swear by this one. You can make 20-30 pips quick. Then close it out and trade with where the trend is going at 12:45am.

This to me is the best way to scalp

Newer system being posted later tonight

--- 帖子 #345 ---
enzo - noon in which time zone ?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Sorry. Eastern time. Market loses juice and price moves opposite direction. It's up to u how many pips u want to grab. I usually stop at 30-40 but today they were moving quick

--- 帖子 #347 ---
thx - so your noon is my 17.00 here in England. I'll watch for it tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Sounds good! I'm in Florida

--- 帖子 #349 ---
sweet pairs are here thank god today is friday

nzdjpy long

gbpaud short

usdcad short

i will post the chart soon

--- 帖子 #350 ---
jesus!! This is one of the cheats i use.

to make it clearer at the close of london section  place an order in opposite direction the tp and sl is left to you to decide

--- 帖子 #351 ---
enzo2325, thanks for sharing your system and indicators. Someone a few posts back was asking what the numbers mean in probability meter. They are as follows:
1. Multi-Info+ :

more than 75 (red/green) for strong Up/Down trend
2. Indice Strength :

0-1-2 for strong Down trend, 7-8-9 for strong Up trend, 3-4-5-6 for sideway
3. Currency pair range :

range of 5 or more between the 2 currencies.

Example: 7-2, 9-3 etc for a strong Up trend .

0-5, 2-8 etc for a strong Down trend.
4 and 5 :

red color for Down trend, green for Up trend and Orange for sideway
The global value in percent (%)

This value is the combination of the 5 values listed above.

75-80% is a good point for triggering a trade.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Here IS THE CHART AS PROMISED

--- 帖子 #353 ---
cheataddict do you close all your trades in the end of the day, and where are your stopps at last crosses? tnx

edit: wifiguy tnx for the info

--- 帖子 #354 ---
if my target is hit or there is a high impact coming i exit and after it i wait for retracement and reenter

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Careful with nzdjpy. It's under the 89 ema and daily macd bars are not both blue. Gbpaud was a great trade even though it was above 89ema because on daily everything was a sell

--- 帖子 #356 ---
NZDJPY has also hit off 50 ema and weekly pivot. I believe its still in a downtrend and just retracing

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Your stops or exits should be if two signals dont match. Especially if TDI crosses you should get out.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Dear Seniors,

Is there any broker with instant execution, high leverage and with no re quotes?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
i am asking this because i am going to open an live account, so i am in search of good broker with above described properties.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I use IBFX and FXDD. I haven't had any issues with them. Every trader seems to have an issue with every broker. Try some out and see how you like them. I wouldn't listen to peoples reviews though because they are all mixed.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Wow ! Nice tip, just took 40 pips on GBP/JPY !

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Everyday this happens

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Shhhhhhh  Don't share too much or the big players will mess with us

--- 帖子 #364 ---
today's trading was rough but

gbpaud made me happy

nzdjpy is still stuck, i am leaving it over the weekend

usdcad was closed b4 the news and placed another order after the news in the direction of the daily TDI all my trades are still open

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Not very wise to keep positions over weekend my friend. NZPJPY is a down bear market. Its only retracing. I would close it first thing sunday and play it safe

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Isn't there a complete template on here?  I've been through the entire thread and files but none of the templates seem to do it?  What have I missed??

Well done. Funny I did something similar but slightly different.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
what is the purpose of adding these moving averages? How we can get benefit from these?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
You need to study moving averages and find out. Prices tend to respect certain averages. DO research and study charts and you will see. YOUR EYES MUST BE COMPLETELY OPEN WHEN LOOKING AT THE CHARTS

Thank you.  Everything is now displayed.

wait for retracement

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi cheataddtct, I don't understand the AUDUSD long. Everything but the ma's are pointing to short

--- 帖子 #384 ---
this is why am longing it

--- 帖子 #385 ---
check eurcad and NZDCHF see whats happening there

--- 帖子 #386 ---
i am impressed , almost your all sweet pairs went in profit. earlier i was bit confused that may be AUD/USD should be in sell as it was selling in Asian session but later it was proved that you were right.

Great

--- 帖子 #387 ---
You are doing a great job buddy! Sorry I haven't been posting a lot. I just had my baby boy...

--- 帖子 #388 ---
And got it absolutely right, very cool. I see you and enzo2325 have a second dynamic trend indicator with 2D D1 D2 and D3. If I may ask, how did you get that? Change the dynamic number? What do 2D D1 D2 and D3 stand for and why do you have an "m" after the currency pair? Sorry for all the questions but I like this system and I'm trading it live.....don't want to miss out on anything.

Oh and congratulations to enzo2325.

1 hour chart. You can see how price bounced off 4 hour 89ema on my 1 hour chart. Thats why its not always safe to take a long trade below 89ema. It can usually be a retracement. Sometimes if the signal is really good you can take it for a quick profit and see how it reacts to certain pivots

--- 帖子 #395 ---
many congratulations enzo you must be so proud

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I would like everyone to post there charts of trades they would like to take. Show set ups you are looking at. Make sure you know the rules first so we dont have to go over the basics. Lets make money together and see if we can steal some profits from the big players this week.

Well the only pair I took tonight was eurusd short. Lets see what happens

cheataddict thank you. What do you got for us??

--- 帖子 #417 ---
have you imagined adding triple screen to your system?this is what i mean add H1 stochastic to the system

in an uptrend

when price retraces to one of the ema  and the H1 stochastic is in OVERSOLD zone or coming out from the zone we place a BUY ORDER

IN A DOWNTREND

when price retraces to one of the ema  and the H1 stochastic is in OVERBOUGHT  zone or coming out from the zone we place a SELL ORDER

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
here is todays trades closed ahead of the high impact news

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I have already added slope stochastic, you are right it give clear picture of trend especially it helps to enter in the trade at right time.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
change the time frame to 60

STOCHASTIC SETTINGS 14,3,3

AND LETS SEE HOW IT GOES

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Awesome job. I'm still short on eurusd and collecting some nice pips. On the new system I did add it but its a 3 tf visual stochastic. Cheataddict you think like me! I like it.

Now looking for reversal on gbpjpy for scalp

--- 帖子 #423 ---
gbpjPY sold

There is nothing left to push market up. Now price will range. With the big move up it should retrace at least 50 pips

--- 帖子 #424 ---
when you are going to share your new system?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
The Navarra system I posted yields great results. Just look at cheataddicts statement. That should do for now. The new system is something personal I am still configuring and messing with. It will take months before its ready and I still don't know if I will share it. Follow the system I have shared and you will do well. Post your trades and set ups you are looking at. That is still the system I am using with tweaks.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I noticed you don't trades run that much. Trading 1 lot and making that little profit what are you going for? 40-50 pips or less?

Still very good job. I hope when you trade live you make that

--- 帖子 #427 ---
i am not hesitating to confess that before finding  Navarra i was struggling a lot and i left the trading due to frequent losses. But after see this system on FF introduced by enzo2325 , i am now confident that i can trade and get some pips.

I bought more than dozen systems from internet but all were failed but this free system is contributing alot.

I especially wanna say thanks to enzo who shared his valuable system with people. cheataddicts is also playing very vital role in making us understand by posting sweet pairs and charts.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
We should expect gbpjpy turn around now It got its last push. keep your eye on it. This is how I like to scalp

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Target for gbpjpy short is 151.00 whole number. Its also where the 200ema is resting on 5 minute chart

--- 帖子 #430 ---
EVERYONE READY FOR THE LUNCH TIME TURN AROUND? watch GBPJPY

--- 帖子 #431 ---
This is a perfect time to short the GBPJPY because news for GBP should be bad. Great position to ride the trend.

Why did I short?

Everyday the market tends to move the opposite direction at lunch time because there is no more volume.

Price hit off a whole number and stopped which was 152.00. If you go to the daily timeframe price hit off the 89ema. We also hit the range day hi and resistance area that the market couldn't pass from August 2-6

--- 帖子 #432 ---
is it possible to use this system without the fxreactor? as i find it takes a lot of cpu cycles

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Yes it is. you can use this.

If you don't see the pairs, where it says suffix on inputs, put the letter m

--- 帖子 #434 ---
i use 1 lots in 20k account becos i want to know if the system will work in a $200 account with 0.01lots. i guess i just confirmed that. i trade the runs but i wasnt busy with somethings at home

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I see. As long as your banking those pips!

Cheataddict thank you for helping with the thread

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Cheataddict,

how is that confirmed ?

put a trade explorer attached...or tell us how is this strat working for you: growt, proffit factor....something ...anything

i would want to see that from anyone following this system (demo or real), that way everyone will learn better

thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #437 ---
if you want to confirm it check the sweet pairs i posted this morning and the pic i posted with the date,time,price etc if it is the same thing i guess that confirms it

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I agree. We have both shown live trades and pips we have made. Theres nothing more to do. Its up to you to demo the system and use your own judgement. The money and growth we are making shouldn't concern anyone.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

hey enzo

many thanks for the indicator. however when i load it it comes up blank, and once applied to a chart it seems impossible to remove. i have tried to load it on other charts with suffix 'm' as you suggested, same result, and also suffix 'g' which is the suffix for my broker global prime. nothing works, looks as it does in screenshot (circled yellow)

any assistance would be greatly appreciated, thanks

EDIT: in the experts tab it gives a "zero divide" error

EDIT 2: ok, problem fixed i loaded it on different broker platform

--- 帖子 #442 ---
relax ..both of you

i didnt question your strat...it was just an observation

you enzo...are here from 2006 and should know that trading is more than 90% confidence in executing the plan

that was the reason for asking a trade explorer from everyone testing (demo or real)

i dont care how much money you make...not even demo dollars.....but every newcomer that arrives on this thread and see that people trade this system...with TE attched and proving that is good strat is a boost in confidence...

anyway...good luck

hope it works for you

--- 帖子 #443 ---
okey i will attach it thank you for your advice

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Here is what I mean by Lunch time turn around. The market didn't move much today and im still waiting on gbpjpy to retrace some. Tuesdays blah

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Really surprised how little market has moved these past couple hours.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
attention!!
take a close look at yen pairs. Yen seems strong and gbp, aud, nzd, chf look like they will be all going down. I am still short from today on gbpjpy.

gbpusd is still looking like a good sell. With news coming out later it should crash down. Gbpnzd looks like a good sell as well as eurnzd.

wait for confirmation on all signals. These are the money pairs tonight

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Your suffix is .G
capital letter with dot at the beginning

--- 帖子 #448 ---

enzo good morning sir

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Good morning my man! Really its good night for me. its 11:30pm on my side here in Florida

--- 帖子 #452 ---
am up 30pips in gbpjpy and usdjpy up 20pips but waiting for signal to exit becos am trading against the daily tdi and it is dangerous

--- 帖子 #453 ---
am in nigeria and it is 4:36am

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Be careful with NZDUSD

Price bounced off 200 ema and 89 ema. There is also a hammer where 200ema bounce took place. 4 hour tdi has curved up. Maybe NZD making another run up

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Remember the Daily TDI doesn't always cross at the same time. Sometimes you can get in early on the trade. You have to study price action to be able to tell not just the indicators. I have been short on GBPJPY for almost 10 hours now

--- 帖子 #456 ---
i have nt been in forex for too long but for the little i have been i studied pa

--- 帖子 #457 ---
No worries.  I will give certain input when you post pairs you would like to trade and its up to you to decide on if you want to take it or not. price seems to always do what it wants anyway

--- 帖子 #458 ---
LIKE Alexander Elder will say the problem is not to know when to place an order the problem is to know when to exit

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Caution with NZDUSD! MIght of been just a retracement and now heading back up! Could end up being a nice long set up to 8100 area (take a couple days to get there)

--- 帖子 #460 ---
yah i see that with the pin bar supporting it

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I find exiting the easiest. I really don't know why traders always have an issue with exit. I treat exits the same way when I want to go home from the bar. When I feel like leaving and the place looks dead im out! Apply that same concept to forex. You can exit at emas, pivots, crosses, macd. You can always exit.

The issue is entering... When to get the best entry with maximum amount of pips. You see I was short on nzd jpy a day ago and price rose. I entered too early. Now its going down. I was short on audnzd a day ago and price rose too much. Now its going down. Entry is very important because you need to make sure you enter in the right way! Exits wont matter if you re on the wrong side.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Whoever has questions posts charts and trades you want to place

--- 帖子 #463 ---
the exit am talking about is when price is moving against you

--- 帖子 #464 ---
60 pips should be your stop loss if trade is going completely against you.

If you're in a trade and up lets say 50 pips. Now price starts moving against you... Did price hit a pivot? ema? you can close. If youre up 50 and now you see you are only up 20 pips close out trade and keep some profit. You can always jump back in.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
just exited the trades from yesterday bye for now

hey cheataaddict

congratulations on another successful basket of trades

i logged on to the system at around 7.15am BST (GMT+1). if i recall correctly some of  those pairs you mentioned did not have all the indicators lined up as  per the classic setup in post 1. maybe it was because  you launched a couple of hours before i did, and they were lining up for you then. but if not, can i ask is there another method/criteria you use to launch trades using this system?

many thanks

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Good morning!! Sweet pips last night

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Just shorted EURUSD before news Keep an eye on chart

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Could of been that he jumped in early. Its best to wait for all signals to line up always. PLay it safe and stay in the game longer. When you re trading demo its easy to jump inn trades early. When you re live you think twice about it.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Yesterday all day I was short on gbpjpy. I had 2 out of 4 signals. I took the trade early and made 20 pips. Once I saw price wasn't moving much and signals didn't march I closed out trade. I tried no to ASSUME price was going to go down even though everyone on the forums though it was. If you just study the chart and wait for signals don't listen to what anyone has to say. Never Assume about price either. Don't think "OK price went up 100 pips not its going to come down" once you get a couple signals line up. Just wait and take the trade when everything is a go no matter how many pips it has moved in that direction.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I hope you are still riding the usdchf.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
closed all trades in profit before news, 80 pips profit

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thursday we have Italian and french bank holiday. I wonder if Euro will go down even more???

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Good job!

--- 帖子 #481 ---
EURUSD is setting up nice. 20 pips in profit. For some reason I cant post a chart... It wont let me save a chart... Maybe later

--- 帖子 #482 ---
As usual its always a risk trading news. Signals can line up and still go the other way because big players need a better price to sell or kill stop losses from people.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
As I said... NZDUSD making a run up. For those of you on that trade...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
i enter early becos i want to enter at the opening of the 3rd candle of the day 5am GMT+1 if my rule 1 is meet and the pair is not in a range

--- 帖子 #485 ---
when i fund my live i will still use that method

--- 帖子 #486 ---
yes, i think i will stick to that advice demo and live and wait till all the indicators in this system line up before executing a trade. i think it will still give a fair amount of trades, today i took two.

but it would still be interesting to know cheataddict's criteria for an early trade, if thats what he indeed is sometimes doing, because he wtill seems to get a pretty decent hit rate, so far anyways.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
EURUSD notes.

Where price is now at weekly s1 is a strong area. price had a tough time on july 26-31 and august 5-6. If we break through now we are looking at Daily s3 (last important area on August 1st) to see what price does. If we break though that we are looking at the 1.3100 area or above

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Can you post chart to explain please

--- 帖子 #489 ---
cheataddict, what is your rule # 1 please? candle colour and daily TDI?  please clarify, thanks

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Still waiting on EURUSD and down 10 pips. There is about 9 minutes for new candle so expecting some heavy selling then

--- 帖子 #491 ---
account growing every day +200pips

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Thanks it is because of you.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Waiting a little longer to see if IM going to close this trade out. Down 13 pips and price is stuck at same level and at 120ema which is a big resistance area on 4hour.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I am also following same procedure. I do enter at the same time.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
here is what i mean by rule 1

ALSO NOTE THAT THE 1HR STOC IS IN OVERSOLD ZONE

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi enzo2325,

I have been trading your system on a live account and it's working very well for me. I like the currency strength indicator you have on your new chart, any chance of sharing it?

thx

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Read all posts. Already shared

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I am currently still short on EURUSD and see no signs of a bullish move. I will stay short throughout the day. I feel like we will bust out of this zone soon and I don't see any reason why it wont. At crazy times like this adjustyour stop losses to 80 pips.

Reason for short?

Price below 89 ema on 4 hour.

Tdi daily and weekly both crossed.

Stochastic daily down

Signal line and trendline down.

MACD bars daily are down.

TARGET is 1.3200 but might even break that

--- 帖子 #499 ---
OK traders... Here is my outlook on long term pairs. This might take a couple days

EURUSD- SHORT

EURAUD- SHORT

GBPNZD-SHORT

CHFJPY- SHORT

AUDNZD- SHORT

Come back at end of week and see how I did

--- 帖子 #500 ---
is anyone trading gbpjpy the lunch hour time

--- 帖子 #501 ---
It has already came down about 30 pips

--- 帖子 #502 ---
am trading it

--- 帖子 #503 ---
what im gathering is its better to launch trades around BST 5am is that right? because in the example of today the CHF pairs made their move shortly after that ..i got in at 7am BST and it was too late

--- 帖子 #504 ---
[highlight=rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)]Well, I trade eastern time and for me I like to get in the trade at 2am or before for best price. I leave it open all night and go to bed. When I wake up around 8am i check and see where trades are and leave them open till 11am. [/highlight]

[highlight=rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)]Dont really know anyone else's time but if you see when I trade you can find out what time it is for you. [/highlight]

[highlight=rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)]Whoever took the GBPJPY pair and is still in like me be happy! its going to ride down for a while[/highlight]

--- 帖子 #505 ---
ok thanks enzo, i think in that case i may stick with the original time ie about 7am BST.

one thing ive noticed though - i think i may experiment with disregarding the daily TDI?  doingf a quick visual backtest it seems to filter out some good trades, what do you think?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Yes it does but it also keeps you out of bad trades. It has saved me many times. I will trade 4h tdi cross if all signals are met. If I see daily not close to crossing then I close because it means its just a retracement. All signals must be met on 4h though

--- 帖子 #507 ---
fair do's. i suppose even with the daily TDI included you can get more than enough trades with this system, i need to check my mentality of wanting to be in every possible  trade rather rathan focusing on quality.

as the saying goes, rather be out of a trade wising i was in than in a trade wishing i was out.

do admit though it is slightly frustrating at this stage  watching other traders successfully bypass some of the entry criteria and still be raking in the pips.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
You can always be in a trade.  Just trade with the trend

--- 帖子 #509 ---
If u go to the eurusd u can see everything is up and 4 hr tdi is up. Daily is down and far apart. I will not trade it because to kentrend is still down. This is how it saves you. You have to have a very clean and sharp cross on tdi to trade it daily stochastic and tdi are down. Thats why I put it on as a a filter

--- 帖子 #510 ---
ah ok thats an interesting example, i can see that.

however lets just say hypothetically in this situation that the daily TDI was not as far apart as it is now, eg the blue line was climbing back up near the red,  would you consider taking the trade? or is the 'do not trade against the daily TDI' rule  best to be adhered to rigidly?

thanks

--- 帖子 #511 ---
The more you trade it the more you will get the feel for when to trade the 4h even if the daily hasn't crossed yet. You will be able to see the difference and where price is. For now its best to just make sure you follow all rules

--- 帖子 #512 ---
DId everyone just see what happened to EURUSD? Anyone else think its strange that price just jumped up at 10:30pm est with no news for 60 pips? Could it be the big Dogs taking everyone's stop losses out for better price? Looks likes a fake to me. While everyone is starting to go long they are getting ready to short big time. Dont follow the fake.

thanks for your continued help

--- 帖子 #520 ---
there is high impart news coming you can shift your sl to BE or in profit position

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I called it! NZDUSD hit 8100!

EURUSD is going down nicely for me. It was just a fake last night and I stayed in even though I was down 60 pips with the hike. currently up 75 pips.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
EURAUD Should of not been traded. Price was at same resistance area August 12. Looked like a double bottom. Yes trend is still down but I would of waited for it to break.

AUDUSD Was not bullish! Weekly TDI was slanted down as well as slope stochastic.

NZDUSD I wrote a couple posts back on august 14 it would hit 8100. That should of been the area to short!

GBPNZD daily macd bars didnt match.

Be careful with trades guys. You have to watch all timeframes

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Some of these pairs were in tight areas. Look at higher timeframes too to see what price is doing. Hope you didn't lose too much

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Just testing it out. That indicator moves so fast with price I don't really pay attention to it.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Sir enzo, today i again got 40 pips, i have set my daily target of 40 pips gain, now i do face lot of trouble during news, can you teach how to trade using
Navarra or what strategy do you use in US session or during news?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Going to remain short on EURUSD and my target will be 1.3200

--- 帖子 #527 ---
What trouble do you have?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Keep an eye on GBPUSD. Hit resistance area of april 30th. 4h tdi and stochastic coming down and also hit off whole number 1.5600. Would not trade yet though

--- 帖子 #529 ---
do you mean the daily trend moves so fast , thats why you dropped it, and you continue to monitor dail dynamic? thanks, sorry ot be a pain just want clarification

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Its the least important indicator I have. GBPJPY has came down about 60 pips and it still say up strong. Actually, im going to get rid of it.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Sir mean how to trade during news or if are already in news should we close the trades? what is your strategy during news?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
what a day -100pip we dont win everyday dats forex 4 you

--- 帖子 #534 ---
i will NEVER EVER leave my morning sweet pips for news to play with

--- 帖子 #535 ---
News doesn't really bother me. Usually its just price manipulation for the big players.

With news you have to be very careful with Price action. You have to see where the daily is. Any pivots close by emas etc..

If you give me examples about why your having problems or post a chart that you took a trade I can explain better

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Good time to short EURUSD  NOW!

--- 帖子 #537 ---
One more thing is I feel like you guys are trading too many different pairs.

You need to choose 1-2 pairs, 3 max to trade. You cant go trading 5-10 pairs. Its too much to handle.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
EURUSD Jumped up again on price. IM still in. This could be manipulation again for people to go long while the "Big" are still short. 15,30,1 h stochastic are all up and price is at pivot. Great time to short again for better position.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I think to test the system on other way. I'll chose 2 or max. 3 sweet pairs for trading (before the 3rd bar (4H)), i'll use the system with 1H,4H,1D TF to find best daily pairs. After that i'll switch that 3 pairs to 5min TF, and watching for best entry prices and setting low profits. I'll fight for 50pips daily. Think to test it for a month with real? enzo what do you think?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
The system is for 4H. That's your main timeframe. Stick with 2 pairs only. I don't trade more than 2.

You have to always loos at daily and weekly to see what the trend is. Where is price and where was last resistance or support. Whole numbers are very important too.

stay away from anything less than 15 minute timeframe. you will lose your money in days or weeks. its too shaky and too much screen time.

Trade off 4 hr only. Then you can switch back and fourth from 1 hour 15 minute and 4 hr. Trade micro lots. That way if your down 60 pips you will not freak out.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Again Eurusd is doing the same thing as yesterday. With nothing to push price up its going up while daily is still showing clear signs of down. What is going on?? The "big" messing around with us again. PLaced another short for even better position.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Thanks for this thread Enzo, great reading. Do any of the indicators that you use repaint?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
No, some of them will switch back and fourth depending on how close price is to 50 line mark and cross of the rsi and macd bars. Just like the normal macd rsi indicator.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Thanks, that's good to hear!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
eurusd should come down now

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Eurusd! thats what you call a wipeout! This is what they look to do. Kill everyones stop losses. Thats why its good to have 80-100 pip stoploss at times like this. Just added more shorts. This should be a fun ride down

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Sir Enzo please comment

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Up or down with respect to emas and pivot and TDI

--- 帖子 #549 ---
YOu can see how price keeps bouncing off 200 ema and going up? It has to close below to go down since its stuck at it again

--- 帖子 #550 ---
if you look at eurusd, price hit off 200 ema exactly on 4h chart before it shot up. I took the 200 ema off last week and of course when I do I realize I need it. I could of closed profit in on it and not have been in any trades till tonight. So 200 ema is coming back on chart.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
thanks sir

YAH

--- 帖子 #573 ---
i am not trading today, all pairs are messed up. There is no clear signal from Navarra System with all indicators line up. so i think today we should be careful.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
My pairs are

gbpusd sell

gbpaud sell

euraud sell

EURUSD sell

IM only in euraud trade. Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #575 ---
look at gbpusd daily tdi and weekly is long

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Sir Enzo,

can you please explain by which rules you are short on GBPUSD and GBPAUD

daily TDI is UP, both Macd up, RSI up, schcostic is up.

for EURAUD daily TDI is upboth MACD up, schsctic is up.

same for EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
IM only in one trade and thats euraud. Tdi 4 h has curved. stocastic slope coming down. Weekly tdi sharp cross and macd down. daily tdi hasnt crosssed yet.

Gbpusd has mixed signals and so does eurusd.

Everything is mixed because of news spiking price everywhere. System is trying to pull signals but price is being manipulated like crazy!

GBPUSD has a shooting star that formed on weeklyr1 or a little below it. 4h tdi has curved down as well as stocastic slope. daily tdi is up and weekly is up so signals are mixed. price his off 1.56500 which is a half # and its almost as important as whole #

--- 帖子 #578 ---
hey guys guess what?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
You found holly grail?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I think this the reason why sir enzo in short trade for euraud.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
any thing new?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
look at your chart i noticed that we can remove some of the indicators and add some that can help us exit trades

--- 帖子 #583 ---
would you help which indicators should be added and which should be removed.

thanks

--- 帖子 #584 ---
The system doesn't need anything else removed except the dynamic and daily signal. Once you start removing things and adding things well its no longer Navarra system. Exit trades at pivots or at stop loss of 80 pips.  It's that easy. No system s going to work a 100% of the time especially on crazy weeks like this and it doesn't happen often. Don't trade too many pairs and only trade perfect set ups

--- 帖子 #585 ---
I see some of you joined in 2012 and 2013 so you haven't been trading long I take it. Have patience and don't try to jump in every trade. Trade smaller and you will last longer. It's not just the indicators you are looking at. You need to be a me to see price action! Zoom out of the chart on daily, weekly, and monthly and see areas of demand and supply. When you see a set up u like take 20 minutes to analyze it then jump in. There is not getting rich in a year. Don't over trade and take your time. You cant enter a trade at every exact moment market is changing. You know why? Because its impossible and no indicator or strategy exits that can do it.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I do agree with you Sir.. you are 100 % right.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I am satisfied with Navarra System, because i earned 25 % of my account in 4 days without any risk.

THIS is why i longed EURUSD

--- 帖子 #603 ---
thanks sir

--- 帖子 #604 ---
ENZO whot do you think? dont you think we need weekly TDI on our charts?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Yes I look at weekly tdi always. It's good for longer term and you will be able to spot retracements better when tdi weekly is up and wide or down

--- 帖子 #606 ---
okey thats why i was telling you to be careful with gbpusd

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Dear cheataddict,

I have observation abt the chart, i think there is no need of new TDI indicator it is being already been shown in above indicator as shown in attached chart.

The important thing is price action and emas, SR levels.

Please correct me if iam wrong , as i am in learning stage.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
This is why I told you to be careful on gbpusd and eurusd. See how price is coming down?

You need to be more careful on price action not just indicators. Keep trading and you will get the hang of it.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I just sold the gbpusd and going to leave it over wknd.

check does pairs in my trade results and APPLY weekly tdi to the charts and you will see how it filter it i will post a chart to explain beta

--- 帖子 #613 ---
good day all lets share ideas post charts of the pairs you will probably trade next week

--- 帖子 #614 ---
cheataddict thats a very impressive and consistent  set of results

can you map out your exact entry criteria you use with this system as i would love to be able to trade like that? as i think you are following your own modified rules for this navarra system?

any help would be MUCH appreciated, thanks

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Pairs to keep an eye on are eurusd gbpusd. These pairs are at the top of the rise. Looking at weekly and daily you can clearly see. Gbpusd on weekly bounced of 89ema for the 3rd time. There should be a huge sell off this week.

Yen pairs should also come down. My eyes are on chfjpy and gbpjpy. Gbpjpy is at too of movement.

As of late Friday I am short on eurusd and gbpusd

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I am short on EURUSD as well. The daily chart is showing a nice pattern for reversal to go downward.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
next week will be intresting

--- 帖子 #618 ---
the only modification i did was only adding a weekly tdi to my chart

so when i wake up by 5pm gmt+1 if my daily tdi is pointing to buy and weekly is pointing to sell i will skip that pair and look for another one that both the daily tdi and the weekly tdi are pointing in the same direction then i place my trade in that direction and i exit at s/r,ema,or pivots thats all i will post a chart to explain what i mean .

PLS ENZO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS GBPUSD PAIR IT MIGHT RALLY UP BASED on PA AND MACD DIVERGENCE

--- 帖子 #620 ---
HERE IT IS

--- 帖子 #621 ---
That isn't divergence.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
cheataddict,  still not 100% clear on the method you are using, would it be possible for you to lay it out step by step what the criteria are? i can see moving averages are involved, as is the weekly TDI, but can you  state the criteria step by step what you look for ?

i also noticed your trades are placed at various times, is this correct? ie you dont just take trades in the morning but check your charts periodically through the day for setups?

thanks man

--- 帖子 #623 ---
pls be careful with it or beta pass it

--- 帖子 #624 ---
there is the criteria

1 by 5pm GMT+1 open the pairs you wish to trade

2 check if both the daily and weekly TDI is pointing at the same direction, if YES,trade if NO, don't trade

3 the Ema crossing is not a compulsory

4 check the other pairs in interval of 4hr to see if the daily TDI have crossed to join the weekly TDI  if yes,trade if no Don't

--- 帖子 #625 ---
thanks, so bascially you are using a heavily modded interpretation of this system, wow it really seems to be working great , please keep us posted with results

personally, even though i've had a rocky week, i will continue with the original system laid out by enzo, firing trades at GMT 6am+1. i am using modded mptm settings of a breakeven and jumping stop as i work dring the day and cannot babysit the trade.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I agree on most. GBPJPY has no direction. If anything its more up then down. Daily is up. Its hovering on the monthly R1 and right above the daily pivot. It should be passed because the 4hr tdi is flat

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Actually stick with it and see what happens. You might be right because its due to fall just dont know how much it will tonight. If you check one hour chart it has bounced off 60 ema 3x. If it passes should be a nice fall. You never know

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hi,

I am short on EURAUD and GBPAUD... only

today is bad day o lost 175 pips on three pairs GBAAUD, EURAUD, AUDCHF.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
How is your trading going on, for me its bad day.

I do request to Sir enzo to explain why trends got s=change suddenly as there was no news?

--- 帖子 #651 ---
a very bad day but i see manupulation by the big players lets watch and see what happens next

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Lots of dumb trades last night. Sundays are not good to trade because market has not picked a direction yet. So most of the time you will lose.

Gbpaud was not ready because like i mentioned earlier it had to close below 4h 89 ema to be a valid sell. EURUSD daily tdi never crossed so it wasn't valid either.

All losers for me. Wont be trading till midnight tonight. Have a good day

--- 帖子 #653 ---
very bad day, all lost what ever earned last week....

Sir Enzo we need your help to teach us how to tackle these trades and days like today and how to minimize the losses.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #654 ---
You can just call me enzo

Well, there is not much I can say because I lost as well. What I will say is that trading Sundays is not always guaranteed. I have lost more on Sundays than any other day. Why? Market just opened and many people in yet. Market hasn't made up its mind on the direction for the week. You have to be very careful on Sundays and pay close attention to pivot areas and emas. Its best to skip Sundays and see where the market is Monday morning.

Last night I took the gbpaud trade. Jumped in too soon. Gbpaud was having a difficult time getting a break on 89ema on 4h. Should of been a cue to long.

Audjpy did as I said and couldn't break past 90 level.

GbpJpy ended up being long as I said it looked more long than short.

Eurusd didnt croos on daily tdi.

Now with calling all those pairs... I still lost last night. That's the name of the game. Its Forex! You don't always win.

If you want to trade Sundays you need to stay up till 4amest . Then you will see where market is heading and take signals.

You can see before 4am signals were good. But... Like I said market hasn't made its mind yet where it wants t go so stay up later and take the best trade.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Couldn't stay out and this look too good for some quick pips

--- 帖子 #656 ---

--- 帖子 #662 ---
same here i lost 175 pips.... no problem , i hope tommorow will be different

--- 帖子 #663 ---
yah thats forex for you tommorow will be better

--- 帖子 #664 ---
How many pairs did you trade and what was your stop loss? 60 pips should of been the stop loss for Sundays since its not that volatile

remember guys take two trades max when trading live. Sunday and Monday a stop loss of 60 pips after trade placed at 1am. When there is a lot of news going on increase it to 80-90 pips

--- 帖子 #665 ---
okey sir let me go and dig up sweet pairs for our next trade tomorrow

--- 帖子 #666 ---
I know I said I would wait but.... I shorted gbpusd and Eurusd. Stop loss is 100 pips.

Why? I believe they have tired out of the up move. Last night proved it with just a 30 pip move up. I believe the big player are looking for better prices before they short this thing for good.

All my signals point to down! GBPUSD AND EURUSD are at the top of move and its a good spot to short.

These will be my only pairs for the next day.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
closed trades for only 6 pips. Going to wait. I feel price will be pushed up more

Don't want to miss better opportunities

--- 帖子 #668 ---
In my opinion today's sweet pairs are

GBPAUD BUY                 EURCHF SELL

GBPNZD BUY                 AUDCHF SELL

EURNZD BUY                 AUDJPY SELL

EURAUD BUY                 AUDUSD SELL

Good day indeed. My gbpusd closed on me because I did a 20 pip SL. Good thing I made it small!

Anyway woke up and sold gbpnzd retracement.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Please keep any eye on

GBPCHF Short

EURNZD Buy

--- 帖子 #700 ---
hey enzo

i was also thinking of reducing the SL, currently i have mine at 70 pips for all pairs, yeserdays losses would have been smaller.

would you recommend any reduction of the stoploss. eg on this system, when all indcators are lined up, if the trade works does it tend to just go in the correct direction on the 4H chart? or is the 70 pip SL good for breathing room?

i was considering trimming SL to about 40

let me know u thoughts many thanks for the great system

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Be careful now. Market has moved a lot. Don't know how much more juice it has. I would be looking for retracements

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Yes! you need a higher stop loss. I made mine small because it was 4am and by that time, if its not going in the direction you think with indicators lined up, then it will turn on you quick! 4am trades don't really need a lot of breathing room

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Retracement trade

You may want to look out for EURCAD. I see a 150 pip move, so when the sys says yes, jump in with both legs and ride it through.

Thanks again for this system.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Banked 86 pips. Just bought GBPCHF

--- 帖子 #744 ---
You have to post your chart and entries. We cant tell you by just asking.

We have to see if you entered late and if all signals were lined up. Sometimes everything can be lined up but you entered too late and price must retrace. Nothing is guaranteed to run forever. Sometime price will go up 100 pips down 40 pips. Down 50 pips up 120 pips

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Already shared. Check through posts

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Pls  enzo post number what.......sorry for my disturbance

--- 帖子 #747 ---
If you want to learn the system read all the posts! I am not skimming them for you. If you want to learn you need to read. Please don't ask again

--- 帖子 #748 ---
enzo,

re: entering too late, i am using the original system of entering trades at around 7am BST (6am GMT + 1) , which equates to around 1am EST  i believe, when all relevant indicators line up. mixed results so far, can you please confirm if this is ok? or would you recommend getting in earlier

many thanks

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Post chart

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Yes you have to make sure its 1am est time. I just checked. You are entering at the perfect time. Dont know what you are doing wrong.

You need to post a chart with entry candle on 4 hr and then another chart with daily and weekly and show same entry

Looking at all the dollar pairs I am not convinced it will be Pro dollar. I feel the news will be bad. This is just judging from my charts. Only trade I am in is gbpchf

Not trading dollar

--- 帖子 #759 ---
If I was to trade this I would sell the USDCHF. Stop loss 30 pips

--- 帖子 #760 ---
good luck am trading the news too

--- 帖子 #761 ---
No I am not trading dollar. I dont think my gbpchf will be affected too much by news. Good luck

--- 帖子 #762 ---
OK only reason why I would of sold usdchf is because my daily tdi and weekly stochastic were showing tren still down. Everything on 4 hour was all pro dollar. Maybe next time I will take 4 hr signal and see. I didnt trade dollar but its good to know which signals are better for news.

Currently up 45 pips on gbpchf

--- 帖子 #763 ---
i traded the dollar but ran out on time

Thanks so much Enzo

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Never trade at that time. See price has gone against you 30 something pips now? That's because the market is retracing. There's not enough movement. These are dead hours. Don't rush in to every trade and trade only the hours you will make money. You could of waited and got in now at a better price and banked pips rather than wait for price to go back down if its even going to go back down

--- 帖子 #772 ---
you're welcome

I see you already bought gbpjpy. You should of taken the reversal my friend.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
ok.yup sure is slower than yesterday

had couple losses yesterday, and my wins were cut short by the trade management EA settings i have, so have altered the breakeven point on MPTM...hoping to lock in those pips and ride out bigger trades with part close/jumping stops

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Everything seems to be rising on yen. Be careful with canadian. CADJPY tdi weekly and daily has rounded out

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hopefully its just retracing and you get a bounce off 200ema

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Great day

Thanks Enzo for todays pairs.

i banked 100 pips today.

I was short on EURUSD 40 pips , USDJPY 40 pips and USDCHF 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
CAdjpy bounced off 200 ema just like I hoped for you it would.

I see you took a big loss yesterday. Your account went down over a $1000. Remember to trade less and at better times. You are over trading and trading too big. This is the same way I lost $35,000 years ago. Don't get too confident and over trade.

Demo trading and live trading are completely different. The emotions and drawdown aren't as serious. If you trade safer now you will trade that way live. Couple bad trades and you will lose all your money just as I did. Take it from someone with experience.

Trade smarter and safer.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Awesome!

Market didn't move too much and my take profit levels were not hit so im still in trades. Banked 100 pips on usdjpy but others are still open.

Going back to bed

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I don't want you to treat this as a signal service. I would like to see you post charts of trades you would like to take and offer some input as well.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
NOTES ON PAIRS.

EURUSD seems to have developed a daily divergence on TDI and Stochastic. All signs point to down. New home sales tomorrow morning should make this bad boy crash.

GBPUSD  will follow ^^^^^^^^

usdchf daily trend is turning up.

I am still in these 3 trades and these will be the ONLY pairs I trade.

i think you need to work on money management...

you`re risking too much...i saw yesterday +34%...today -39% this is not normal...even on demo

anyway...keep up the good work

thanks

Traders need to learn when to trade and when not to trade. What is going to kill your account is OVERTRADING! Trying to get in every move. Relax and trade smart. Don't worry about trying to double your account in 3 days. You will lose it in 4 days if you trade that way.

I will say this again...

Trading hours are 1am est time to 11am est. That's it! after that shut your computer off and walk away.
Come back at 11pm est time and find a good pair to trade.
Max 3 pairs!

If you want to trade the lunch time reversal its a 2-3hr trade. just go for 25-40 pips and close it.

live by these rules and you will make money.

remember guys, I created the system and know its ins and outs with almost a year of screen time. sometimes it gets the best of me also but not anymore. Every trade I do now I do it for my baby boy and that keeps me trading smart.

good luck

Hi Enzo2325, For the record I follow your system to the letter and this thread closely. I trade rather conservatively and am happy to take a 15pip profit on the lunch time turn around. As always experimenting with different indicators and rather than the "auto pivots" I use "Fibonacci pivots". If you remember your eur/usd where it bounced off the 200 ma? it also bounced straight off the fib pivots.

This is a great system, keep up the good work.

Very nice. Continue to post charts and share your trades.

For me, it was a good day. using the original system and firing trades at 7am BST as per rules, only one of my pairs had all indicators lined up correctly and with probability meter over 75%, and that was USDJPY. using part close after breakeven settings with a trade manager ( i cannot babysit trades as after firing them off i go to work) - made 125 pips

enzo i think you are right in that quality, not quantity is the key here. theres mad modifications to this system already and its only neww here, i think the original system has potential as is and should be tested . just my $0.02 im a newb myself

--- 帖子 #802 ---
The original system allowed me to buy my fiance the ring she wanted. I would say it works

Its always quality. Here is the original system for me right now (below)

People always seem to modify systems and its fine with me because it wont bother me or my trading style. I presented what works for me and if people want to switch it around that's on them. Its not my money that's being affected.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
I wont post charts of my new system because I like to trade a system 6-8 months before i expose it.

Now I traded earlier than 1am tonight because its Thursday and price retraced right to my sweet emas so I jumped in since these pairs have been ranging for so long.  only a day for these to blow up so I wanted a good entry price.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
If you to stick to the rules the signals are pretty accurate. I would never take a signal at 6pm because it could be only retracing. 1am est is the sweet spot to place a trade and even later. London opens a 3 so its good to start finding pairs a couple hours before then.

Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Cheataddict, unfortunately didn't follow the rules the past day because he was on a hot streak. What happens when you get on a hot streak? You start thinking you cant lose. Remember I posted this on my very first post I believe. Confidence will sometimes kill you. Remember forex is not predictable.

I can see he has placed trades at the off hours that I do not recommend and price has gone against his position. Again, like now traded the eurusd and bought taking signals from the off hours. Not a good signal to take. This is when the system can fail. Im glad he's only trading demo so he can learn from his mistakes because he was doing so well before.

Rule#2 I also said is when you have a bad trade shut the computer off and walk away. Don't try to get back in because you will lose again. Your mind is trying to make the money back anyway it can and you're not thinking clearly.

Cheataddict I apologize for using you as an example but you have done the same thing I did years ago . I hope you take this as motivation and guidance to jump back and make some money.

This is why you need a stop loss of 80 pips. See price almost hit off the 200 ema red line circled up top. This would of put me close to my stop loss. If price would of passed it I would of closed trade. Luckily it didn't

Price is going back down quickly now

Good morning everyone. Getting ready for this news and going back to sleep! only on 3 hours of sleep. News last night seemed like a fake. I hope none of you closed out positions. I ended up losing on the gbpaud trade. I knew it was going to come back down but I didnt want to risk it so lost 80 pips there. Of course price came back down and is following eurusd which is good to know. up a total of 170 pips right now. Lets see what happens

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Ok folks thats it for me. Currently im down 495 pips due to news but im not really worried about it. I am going to hold trades through the weekend. Weekly charts show change in trend next week and I will stick to my guns.

Have a good weekend

--- 帖子 #833 ---
yes there is news, but also dont forget on fridays a lot of institutiuonal traders close out their order books for the weekend hence a lot of large  reversals.

hope traders here holding overweekend positions get a turnaround on their baskets next week

here it is

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Just remember Sundays can be tricky. Market doesn't have a direction yet and Europe doesn't get involved too much till early morning. I wouldn't take any signal too serious. Play it safe and see how prices react to certain areas. To jump in right away for a couple pips isn't with it. There is news on nzd tonight. If you want to trade check all nzd pairs and see whats going on with all of them and see if bullish or bearish

--- 帖子 #840 ---
thanks man i will

--- 帖子 #841 ---
OK everyone still in same trades as last week.

Short on

gbpusd, eurusd, Audusd

long on

usdchf, usdjpy

Traded heavy on Friday because I have been trading light for a bit.

Just shorted audusd again and added a long to usdjpy. Price retraced a little and got in at another good position.

hello enzo.

please can i ask your opinion on daily TDI MTF?  is it a valid trade if it is pointing in the direction of the trade, but hasn't quite crossed over yet?  or would you advise not to trade unless a clear cross has occurred on the daily TDI?  ps im not trading this pair right now as its not 7am BST, this is taken only for an example- many thanks

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Do no trade yet. News was a fake. Price went right back where it opened up yesterday. I am still in same trades and will hold position. There will be no clear direction until tonight. If you want to scalp this morning then go ahead on a lower timeframe.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I cant seem to open up your chart. I think you copied it differently. What pair is that?

--- 帖子 #855 ---
You have a long way to go to cover up losses. I hope you can do it this week. Have faith in system and don't overtrade.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Ok I see its NZDUSD.

The main trend on this pair is DOWN. You can see the weekly and daily chart. Take the next short signal you get. Price is also under 89ema and 200 ema on 4hr.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
yah i do this week might do

--- 帖子 #858 ---

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Well, market once again will be boring this morning. News starts at 4amest time so I'm assuming we will have a range market. Closing computer and coming back tonight. For those of you who don't want to lose money in dumb situations I would advise to do the same. For those of you who have to be in every trade and cant help it... Good luck

--- 帖子 #860 ---
As you can see price is starting to go in favor of my trades. I am only down 180 pips now compared to 500. For those of you who took signals last night or early this morning I would say to close them and save what you can. See you guys later

--- 帖子 #861 ---
thanks for the advice enzo

i will bear that in mind re: the additional information of weekly indicator.

however i am sticking with  trading the original system as laid out by yourself , which is a proven method which does not take heed of the weekly. . in my opinion that will filter out to many trades.

another question i have is what is your opinion on the probability meter? should we wait for it to be at least 75% to take a trade or is there some leeway on that  - can we take the trade at a lower percentage, if all the other indicators line up?

thanks again

--- 帖子 #862 ---
I no longer use the probability indicator. Its to quick to reverse on you and I don't like indicators that move too quickly.

Regarding the weekly tdi, I did use it on original. Remember, I trade 4H chart so I look at daily and weekly charts. That means I look at everything those charts including TDI.

You can use the weekly TDI to show you the overall trend and still take signals from 4h and daily. Just remember where weekly is heading. If the weekly TDI is crossed down for 5 days, within those days price can range up and down about 100"s of pips. So you can still trade those moves up if 4H and daily match and then hop back in with long term trend if weekly tdi is still valid. Nothing is set in stone

--- 帖子 #863 ---
ok thanks, i will bear this new information in mind , and remove the probability meter

your original system seemed to be based on the indicators lining up, your new chart seems a lot more stripped down, so i guess price action and reading the chart comes more into play now is that correct? can you give any other pointers now for what works,  apart from PASR?

thanks

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Thats pretty much everything.

1.3400 seems to be holding for EURUSD. All my shorts are in and hoping this week is the crash. Weekly and daily charts are looking positive for change. Could be tomorrow or day after but this baby is looking weak

USDCHF price has been stuck at the weekly pivot from 4/14, 6/9 ,6/19, 8/4 till now. Seeing reversal signs as well

GBPUSD closet one of all 3 to come down.

Just my observation

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hi Enzo,

I am thinking to short AUDCHF and AUDUSD? please provide your valuable input?

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Yes I like the audusd trade. I recently just closed out 40 pips on it. Good trade

--- 帖子 #868 ---
target monthly s1

--- 帖子 #869 ---
we should be focusing on Fed’s tapering as confirmation for taper would add more demand for the USD, and when you combine that with the uncertainty of Greece(Bail out), we ’ve got a good recipe for EURUSD sell in the short-term.  As long as the recovery in the Euro Zone remains painfully slow, I believe EURUSD still is a SELL on rally play.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
an trade on audusd short should be closed becos it is looking for space to breath it might rally up

Good morning everyone.

What a ride! News keeps being negative? Funny how it doesn't spike up more? Seems like its running out of steam?

News is that Morgan stanley has opened up positions to sell GBPUSD and BUY USDJPY. They have huge pending order on these pairs so when the reversal will happen we don't know but should be soon. Also USDCHF is a long position.

@ISA yes thats a great pair to buy and im in the ride as well.

Still short on gbpusd and eurusd. Before I went to bed last night I was up 220 pips and back in th negative today so holding positions and going to ride eurgbp for a while.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
GOOD MORNING SIR

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Well, As you know I have been working on new system for a couple weeks tweaking it daily. Trying to make use of higher timeframe indicator for higher probability trades and of course... Larger pips. IM not interested in baby (12-30) pips. I want the big (100-150) pips where I don't have to continuously watch the screen. I have perfected it from 1H to weekly I believe. I will not be making anymore changes to it and will be posting all my trades that I take with it starting after these current trades are closed.

As of right now I have EURUSD short and GBPUSD short open. They don't 100% match the current system signals but am pretty deep to close them.

I hope you all made some pips last night.

Best thing to do now is shut your computer off and come back tonight. Don't worry the pips will always be here

--- 帖子 #878 ---
The following are the latest technical outlooks and strategies for EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY and AUD/USD as provided by the technical strategy team at Barclays Capital.
EUR/USD:An Inside day posted yesterday keeps our view unchanged. We maintain a bearish view targeting 1.3300/10 initially, and then the 1.3200/20 area. Sell rallies while 1.3420 caps on a closing basis.
USD/JPY: Having failed to move above trendline resistance at 99.15, we now expect a deeper pullback within range, towards 97.00/05. However, thereafter, a 97 to 99.20 range is likely to persist into Sep and we would look to buy near the range low. Bigger picture, targets are to 103.80 and the 108 area.
GBP/USD: We are bearish, looking for a return to 1.5420 and potentially 1.5350. A move back above 1.5670 would turn us neutral instead while wider range highs near 1.5750/75 act as medium-term caps.
AUD/USD: Near term, support at 0.8930 is under pressure. A break below this level would warn of a move to the 2013 low near 0.8850 which should hold firm on initial attempts. Bearish pressure remains in the absence of a move above 0.9040.

Morgan Stanley changed its bets and tactical trades on the JPY 180 degrees in just a couple of weeks. Back in Mid August, MS was tactically bullish on the JPY withthree positions against the EUR, GBP, and NZD.
A weak later, MS turned tactically bearish on the JPY closing all of these 3 positions and opening a long USD/JPY via a limit order at 97, with a stop at 95.75 and a target at 106. Seeing this as a high-conviction trade, MS added another long USD/JPY on Friday with the same target and stops as for the existing trade.
"We have decided to add to our long USDJPY position. With BoJ Governor Kuroda sounding more flexible about using additional monetary expansion to offset fiscal contraction, we believe the appropriate Japan policy mix is back on track. As investors regain confidence in Abenomics, risk appetite should rise supporting foreign outflows from Japan, weakening JPY further," MS says as a rationle behind this call.
MS also maintains a short GBP/USD position from 1.5570, with a stop at 1.5750, and a target at 1.4800.
"We remain bearish GBP as it will become more and more difficult for UK economic data to beat expectations, especially in an environment of ongoing deleveraging and low productivity. We look for the BoE to push back on the recent rise in front end rates," MS adds as a rationale behind this call.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
this is an important news thanks

--- 帖子 #881 ---
You are very welcome.

Closed out EURUSD trades. Was tired of waiting around forever for that one. When the time is right I will sell it. As of now with new signals everything is invested in GBPUSD short.

For those of you who took the EURGBP trade stay in. Looks like a nice one to run

EUR resilience has been impressive over recent weeks. Despite all efforts at trying to sell the currency, investors have has their fingers burned.
Today is also not a day to sell EUR.
Although the growth trajectory looks firmer in the US, the propensity to surprise in a positive direction has come from Eurozone data releases.
Today we expect a further positive surprise, with a likely further rise in the IFO German business survey which will contrast sharply with the drop in headline July US durable goods orders.
It’s not all bullish for EUR, however.
Technical indicators suggest that upside EUR/USD momentum is fading while Greek jitters could return as the Troika returns on September 16. Moreover, speculative market EUR positioning has risen to its highest since early February, leaving no more scope for short covering.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
For those of you in the EURGBP trade.

TARGET SHOULD BE MONTHLY PIVOT OR WHOLE #8700

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Notes on the EURUSD.

It is acting just like the USDCHF. The USDCHF was stuck at the weekly pivot for quite sometime and then eventually busting through it.

EURUSD is also stuck at the weekly pivot on weekly chart. I am seeing target of monthly R1 and even whole # 1.3600  Be careful with her

Remember guys you don't have to rush in every trade. Sometimes its good to step back, zoom out of chart and see the big picture. Prices seem to be just retracing now and ranging. We will see if im right about these pairs.

I have buy limits and sell limits set if they break whole number or not and above or below 89 ema

GBPUSD and reentered short again.

EURGBP still seems bullish to me. It didnt break below 89ema on 4H. Will wait for next signal to long to 8700

Banked Hella pips last night folks!

Today is Thursday so you know the market moves a lot tonight to tomorrow morning. We have a lot of news tonght.

I am short on EURJPY GBPAUD GBPNZD

I already closed out a total of a 100 pips on CHFJPY short.

Lets have some fun

--- 帖子 #939 ---
gbpaud is not a good pair to short

eurjpy si very okey to short

gbpnzd is also not very okey to short let me post the chart and explain

good trading today

using entry rules of original system again, made a ton of (demo) money on EU short, EG short, and UCH long.  my demo account is almost back to breakeven of £10,000 after a low of ~ £8650 a few days back (including losses from the monday 19th slaughter). lets see if i can maintain in the green going forward.

using the MPTM (very useful) trade manager with the settings attached (25 pip breakeven, half close at breakeven, 15 pip jumping stop  after breakeven to lock in remainder of move)

seemed to have worked very  well yesterday and today.

note: the settings use a stoploss of 40 pips as opposed to 70 as laid out in original system. for now i am testing a reduced stoploss, albeit against the advice of enzo, on the basis that a trade if lined up correctly should not need in most cases 70 pips of breathing room. again, i am probably wrong because i do trust enzo's many months of experience using his system, but sheeeeeit, lets see if i can get away with this.

these settings also assume a trade size of 1 lot  for the part close routines after breakeven. if you are using other lot size adjust values of part close accordingly. also, remember to enable expert advisers on your mt4 platform.

note2: for some reason unbeknownst to me, some brokers require an extra '0' in front of the values to work properly, and i am talking about even between 5 digit brokers.  for example i am testing navarra on 5-digit FXCM  demo and in the MPTM EA  15 pips is 15, whereas on DF Markets, another 5-digit broker, you would need to add a zero.  test it on your broker those who want to use it, and if you get invalid stops errors you probably need to add a zero.

note3: ps attach the MPTM to any currency pair, any timeframe, preferably high tick rate pair like GBPJPY or EURUSD, on a separate chart. the settings will handle all  trades.  ***IMPORTANT*** you will also need to rename the settings file suffix from .txt to .set   -

for some reason this board does not allow attachment of files ending .set

am sitting on my hands as usual for tomorrow due to friday volatility. although having said that, the MPTM settings attached *should*  breakeven/lock in pips in the event of trade moving in favour and subsequent reversal, but having said that i am a creature of habit and will stay out tomorrow.

good trading people lets all share tips and go forward together thanks again to enzo for the system

Be careful with USD pairs. I would not trade them due to syria news and war.

Stick to yen pairs to the downside!

Lets make some money.

These are the pairs that i have entered. Let's see how it plays out..

Happy pipping traders!

We all lose... It's how you bounce back and learn from it that's important. Never try and make your money back in one shot. Little by little.

You don't workout and get ripped in a day. Its takes time, effort and will power.

There should be some huge swings going on this week.

US and Canada banks will be closed tomorrow so I don't expect much movement in market. Thats why I took the eurusd opposite direction trade.

there is another aud news coming

--- 帖子 #985 ---
System Change update
Recent trades I have extended my stop loss to 110 pips.
Trading 4 hour charts, 80 pips is just not enough especially on exotic pairs. Example: last friday I was down 100 pips on Gbpnzd and Sunday night, market opened up and I was in profit. Tonight same thing happened... GBPAUD was a bear market and the first news put me at -90 pips. Second news that just came out now im up +13 pips. This is why its better to trade with less money because your draw down wont be as a big.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Closed out combined of +83 pips on GBPAUD.

Last nights trade 189+ pips profit . Clolsed out all trades

Just sold GBPNZD and GBPUSD before news

Sorry I didnt post a chart of the profit in pips. I woke up and closed right away while holding my baby

Closed out all gbpusd trades and banked ve3ry nicely on those. 120+ pips. This week is starting off really good! Been working on my timing. Getting in at the right time means everything. I have been also closing out my trades 20 minutes before news and saving profit. This has been helping a lot and I will continue to do so.

As if now I am all in on GBPJPY and GBPNZD short.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
You think

GBP/NZD will turn around?

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Yes I think so but am not a 100% sure. It bounced off the 23.6 fibo and jumped back up.

As of now its ranging between yesterdays high and low. It should hit off the 50% fibo and monthly pivot. A nice couple 100 pips down.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
GBPJPY is a short too.

I count help it and jumped back in for lunchtime trade.

I am short again on GBPJPY and GBPNZD with current gbpnzd short from earlier where I was in the negative. Never closed that one because It hasnt hit my stop loss and I feel as if price will come back down.

I feel as GBPNZD has to catch up to EURNZD. They move together and EURNZD had a really nice run down.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Price has stalled... GBPNZD has hit weekly pivot and is chillen there . Lets see if it moves down now. Its a good place to short

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
one of my GBPNZD trades is at a -102 pips. this is why stop loss needs to be bigger with exotic pairs.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Trades will remain open. Biggest draw down is -130 pips on one of my GBPNZD . This pair is so volatile that anything less than 120 pips stop loss is not even worth trading. I have seen this pair move like water. I will hold my positions for most of day. Price is at a whole number now so we will see how she reacts.

See you tonight. Off to work

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
added one more short to gbpaud

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
had one trade using original rules today, AUDNZD long... good trade, but  didn't capture the whole move because of my trade manager jumping stop after breakeven  settings, so have increased that from 15  up to 20 pips

beginning to feel more confident in this system slowly, still have to get a proper  feel for it before going live hopefully

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Sorry I havent posted. Been banking pips left and right like crazy!!

Careful with USD pairs. USA is going to attack Syria and the dollar should be weak. Been trying to say that for a couple hours now but been glued to screen and son.

GBPNZD and GBPJPY is making me some sweet pips right now. Back to work. See you guys in the MOrning

7,863 pips since Sunday night and the week isn't even over!

GBPNZD pulled out 400 pips alone! I didnt make too much on that one because gbpjpy kept going up.

Great time to short usdchf and usd jpy for a long run down

UNfortunately signal at that time are not valid but I took the trade and had faith it would come down even last night. Never again will I do that. I woke up this morning around 6am est and placed more trades and... Covered all my losses with these babies below.

Hi enzo..i  am new here.. and using your system for my live account... its a nice system ...

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
System is still under testing. Like i said on earlier posts I like to test a system for 6 months. Theres still things that need to be tweaked. Just because there are some good wins doesn't mean its finished.

Navarra system is still what im using with some tweaks. I still don't even know if I will share this new one. Its under testing and when done I will decide if I want to.

As of now, Navarra system is good enough. If you follow rules and trade smart you will make more money then you can handle.

Cheataddict, you are proof that navarra system is the bomb! Your account has tripled again!

Hopefully before the end of today they will all be in profit

Hi Enzo,

Where can I find the template that looks like yours. Mine looks a quite cluttered

Also, was just wondering about your GJ trades. Which candle did you enter on? The current one? I'm trying to get my head around the system and how it works.

Cheers,

Jason

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
The trades u listed that were losers were closed out too soon. They were all in the right direction. The news just tried to take people out before resuming new trend. Next time stay in trade and increase your stop loss like did. Especially when you trade exotic pairs.

Learn from your mistakes and next week you will be even better. Each week that passes you learn what you dd wrong and improve. This week you didn't over trade and traded at the right hours. See how good you did following rules? Good job again

--- 帖子 #1062 ---

Hi  enzo2325

I  have  been  following  your  thread  for  some  time  ( though  iam  a  renkochart  trader),          is a  great  job  i  commend  you  and  i  say  more  pips  to  your  account.

please  sir  in  your  previous  trading  system  i  saw  something  like  (currency   strength  meter  indicator)   in  the    right  down  side  of   your    chart,  please  can  you  post  it  to  me.   thanks

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
Enzo, awesome thread.

Yo Cheat, are you still using the H4 entry with emphasis on D1 and weekly?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
I will re post the currency strength meter when I get back on main computer tomorrow. Thank you guys for the compliments. As of now I am testing out the new version of Navarra system. It's basically the same thing with a few tweaks and trading off of whole numbers more. Seeing and reading more price action on daily and weekly charts and then placing trades off of 4 hours. Price action is king! Then come indicators.

Cheataddict is trading the original Navarra system and with great success. I will be posting live trades I take with both systems combined. Sometimes I can't post every single trade I am in or take due to my other obligations but the most important and most profitable trades will be posted live.

Next week should be a good week for yen pairs to be weak. We will be able to see more once market opens. There are some jpy news announcement Sunday night so I will be on at 6pm est time to possibly trade it if set ups are good.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
enzo i also want to say thanks  again for the system . i am demo trading the original with my own part close/trailing stop  routines, with some success. also using common sense basic PASR (price action support resistance) and chart patterns, eg not selling into strong suppport zone etc, but otherwise leaning heavily on the indicators

looking good so far

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Hi Enzo,

Just a thought but why not link to an explorer account, followers of the system could then buddy you and see your trades in real time thereby helping us to understand the system in more depth. Plus we could maybe make even more pips

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Thank you guys.

Wifiguy, I am kind of a private guys and choose not to do a trade explorer. I don't want everyone following my every move or questioning some of my trades. Sometimes I might trade at off hours to scalp market and don't feel like I need to explain why I did it.

As of now, just sharing the system with you and telling you what I see should do.

For those of you on Demo account experiment with the system. Trade whatever you see and feel. Break the rules. Get it all out of your system, After all it =s demo money. It doesn't matter how many times you blow the account or grow the account. The money isn't yours and doesn't exist.

Over trade and see what you come up with. See when are the best times for you to get in and out based on your time available to trade. You should never be taken one or 3 trades on demo. Why would you even bother staying up and watching the chart that long?? I personally have never demo traded in my life. Dont really see the need for it. You don't buy a lotto ticket with fake money do you?

Demo trading should be to trade, trade and more trading. Get all your bad habits out out the way because guess what? If you dont. when you go live, They will come and haunt you and you will blow your live account!

Long night at work and too much wine for me

Just thought I'd post this updated TDI indicator if anyone's interested. I just added a signal histogram at the bottom of the indicator window to make it easier to tell when the line has crossed.

In terms of following the indicators on the H4 chart, is a signal only valid on the first candle where all the indicators line up? I mean, say they line up 5 times in a row, in terms of the system, would that mean that you open a new trade on each candle? Or only on the first candle where the indicators line up?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
moved to live trading cheat ?

you seem to do very well on demo...so i was curious

keep it up

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
only the first candle then ride the trend it is now yours

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
I noticed that the current candle RSI filter, macd candle and macd indicators can change as they depend on close price, would you therefore wait for the following h4 candle for a signal? Eg, if the signals line up on the previous candle then open a trade on the open of the next?

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
already trading live

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
No sir not for you

I was just stating to experiment on demo and not take it so serious. Thats all. Demo is a good way to kill all your bad habits and and curiosity you have against system. IF you get it all out of the way while on demo when you or anyone else end up going live you will now be free of demons.

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Well, last night was a loss for me. My positions ended up getting liquidated due to too many positions open.

What did I do wrong and why did I lose? This one is very easy.

Market opened up on Sunday night with a gap. When I see a gap usually price comes back down or up to cover the gap. So without taking signals I placed orders too soon on Sunday night and assuming price would cover gap. Since the market was going down on Friday I thought It had to continue on SUnday. What I messed up on is Sundays the market tends to find a new trend or continue on old. You see? I traded what I thought and not what I saw. I assumed. Assuming in the forex will kill your account. So I made a rookie mistake. I traded too early on Sunday night and I assumed.

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
I learned lessons like these the hard way (live). Seeing the losses mount and my account balance tick down made me sick. For me, it all boiled down to greed... I'd be up 100-200 pips and instead of walking away for the day, I'd open a new position because I felt like I couldn't lose. Guess what? 9/10, I would lose. When you stray from the system/rules you've set for yourself, you will always lose.

Enzo is a great trader but he broke his rules, jumping the gun and placing orders too soon so he lost. That should tell you something.

Trade what you see with a system that works for you. Otherwise, you're just gambling.

Anyway, last nights's trade:

USDJPY long - 60 pips

USDCAD short - 40 pips

EURUSD short - 30 pips

sori foor your loss tomorrow will be beta

Hi Guys,

just wondering whether you wait for the candle to close once signals line up, or take them during the open candle knowing that they could change mid session.

for example, gbpchf is showing a long on my h4 chart on the current candle, would the system say to enter now? Knowing that the signal may change? Or, do I wait until this candle closes and if its still all green, then go long?

hey enzo

i only took that one trade as i am following my interpretation of  the original rules, opening trades at 7am BST. and i also use basic PASR, (ie basic patterns, dont buy into resistance and sell into support) - and the GU long was the only valid trade at the time. i have kept the probability meter on just as a guide, generally if its over 50% i will take that as a positive,   i also keep daily dynamic on the chart.  for me, the first thing i look at is are the 3 dashboard lights all the same colour? if so then i will look at the indicators at the bottom, ie RSI, fast/slow MACD and both the TDI windows.

can you tell me if you think i am missing out on trades? as you said there were lots of good trades, ; i am following the original system, i think you are following a new hybrid of the system.  i know that you suggested dropping the probability meter and daily dynamic. can you please suggest a variation of your original template that will give me more good trades, eg ignore the dashboard /probability meter and just take the indicator windows, or something?

many thanks

ps two good trades and one stoploss today ( i am using a reduced 35 pip stoploss)  - NZDUSD long, EURJPY long, both  good, EURUSD long stopped out. overall small net loss.

Hi All,

I prefer to see the candle colors so I updated to out of the box MACD  indicator to match the MACD colors. Just thought I'd post it if anyone's interested.

Best to just jump straight in hey?

Anyway, I'm still a bit unsure if this is correct (I've ditched the D1 TDI for now as I'm just practicing) and using H1 TDI instead on a H4 chart.

I went Long GBPNZD and short NZDCAD, I noticed on both of them since I entered, the MACD Bar and the RSI kept flickering from green to red.

Price could go in the opposite direction and negate the signal before the candle close, so I'm still unsure on this bit.

you dont have to wait for the candle to close as far as the indicators are lined up hop in

using 1hr TDI on h4 is risk because you will pick up many false trades

sweet pairs

AUDNZD LONG

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
audchf,eurchf,gbpchf,gbpjpy all long

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
so stick to 1440? Do you always ensure the H4 and D1 TDI line up?

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
yes i must line up check does pairs i posted you will understand what i mean

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
I wonder if my settings are correct, here are my observations:

AUDNZD looks like it just went short on my chart.

You re confused of what? The little system you Created?! You are not even trading Navarra system! You basically made your own little system out of my system and now have questions on it?? Haven't even traded navarra system and already changed it??

Go back to page 1, download navarra system and see all the questions we have already answered!!

If you want to trade your own version or style then figure out what is wrong with your indicators.

The candle has to close in order for the bar to stay red or green. Same way when a traditional stoch or macd crosses. It can cross back and fourth.

Now if you want to trade your system don't ask any more questions on it till you have figured it out. This is for navarra system only!

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Yea, its been pretty boring. I made 30 pips on eurusd, 30 pips on usdchf, and about 30 pips on gbpnzd

I think tonight the market should boom! Usually Wednesday on the market moves a lot if its slow beginning of week

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
yah i guess we will catch the trend

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
Yen pairs are very overbought. I'm short on nzdjpy, usdjpy. Later I will check aud jpy and gbpjpy

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
Currently short AUDUSD. Up 30 pips at the moment. I opened this trade last night and held onto it even though it went against me -60 pips.

EURUSD short down 60 pips. Let's see if it comes back my way.

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
AUDUSD IS A NICE PAIR TO SHORT  BUT EURUSD WILL IS OVERBOUGHT IN H4 AND IN A NICE UPTREND in D1 SO AN LITTLE PULLBACK YOU SEE PLS CLOSE IT TO MINIMIZE YOUR LOSSES thanks

Hi every one,

Cheataddict and Enzo

What do you say about eurchf? what should be TP for this pair?

today is good day for me ..

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
consider

tp 1.23476

sl 1.23886

happy pipping

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
there is eur news coming in 30mins

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Cheataddict, Blamshak, Bonkers, abdulaziz You guys are doing awesome. I appreciate you guys posting and getting involved in thread. Together you guys can grow and and make system better. More brains working in harmony the better.

As for new comers I dont have time for ignorant or dumb questions. The system is so basic and easy that If you dont have time to read at leaast the first 20 pages and look at the example screen shots of when to place a trade and when to take profit.... well, then I dont feel like helping you! If you are lazy to read Then go to another thread.

Zoidy got tossed out of the thread because he was lazy and didn't take time to understand Navarra system. Now he has made a thread of the improved navarra system . How do you improve something you don't even know how to trade?!

Anyway, Patience is pretty short these days for stupidity. I am building a 1/2 million dollar beautiful restaurant,  a baby I been dealing with that's very new for me and strange, beautiful wife to keep satisfied and a thread to help non lazy traders.

If there is one thing that makes this system even better its timing. Time your trades just right. Zoom out of chart and look where price is. See where double tops are, key resistance areas on daily and 4 hour. Wait for price to get close to it and then place your trade when signals match. Take your time. Better to take 10 winning trades then 25 trades that are 10 winners and 15 losers agree?

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
agreed

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
gbpusd and nzdusd are looking good for a short.

Im up a 150 pips so far on yen pairs

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Hello all,

I've been watching this thread for a while and while I seriously considered trading Enzo's awesome system, basket trading has been my game for a long time so I thought I'd try to get the best of both.  I trade the T101 BTS system so I grabbed a handful the Navarra tools and placed them on my core 5 basket candle offline chart and ..... WOW!, it's a great tool to trade my basket also!  Everything that applies to single pairs applies here as well.  Thanks Enzo!

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
Great job sir. You should continue to post charts and trades you are thinking of taking so we can all brainstorm on certain pairs.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Will do, I feel a short coming on very soon according the the previous chart.  The up arrows next to the pairs represented by the offline chart are on a D1 HAS signal so they are still blue and the TDI 1440 still agrees but all else looking down.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
enzo thanks for posting the system!

hope all goes well with that restaurant ...hopefully if we can make some money with this system we can all fly over and dine there one day when its completed and visit your lovely family

i am trading this system (with a variation on profit taking) in largely its original form, taking trades at 7am BST. probability meter is still on there but i have reduced the threshold to 55% as opposed to 75% if all else is ok.   i definitely feel it is giving me an edge, my account balance is slowly edging up in measured paces. after 4 1/2 years in the forex wilderness of failure i feel a tentative glimmer of hope.

all the best and i will keep the thread posted, all of you guys doing well keep on sharing as well

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
I would of shorted that pair already at the first red candle where all signals matched to the daily s2 or s3. Even though daily didn't match signal was still good to get in early. When you have all signals like this one that match, you can take it for short pips to first pivots. 30-40 pips to s2 or s3 and close if daily tdi doesn't cross. If it does cross then you were in extra early and can bank hella more pips.

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
That would be awesome indeed!

Maybe I should add the probability meter back? What settings do you have on that?

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
I did short it at the top and got some nice pips.  I closed a few hours ago when things got choppy....see if the US session gets things back on track - then I'm back in.

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
Oh ok! Well then you read it perfect. Good job!

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Im waiting for gbpusd to come crashing down! nzdusd should be coming down as well

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
hi.

hey

i have the probability meter at default settings, its just that i have lowered the threshold to 55% rather than 75% for a trade, all other things being good. if its lower than 55% i usually pass on the trade. i may need to review my use on this though, because you are right it does tend to fluctuate quite a bit and it may be making me miss out on good trades

I'm still a forex newbie but Navarra has been by far the easiest system I've traded.

I agree 100% on being patient and timing trades to get better entries. Bank more pips while reducing chance of having a loss.

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
Pips are adding up for you bonkers! Awesome job. Keep it up.

Timing is everything. Now if u take a look at nzdusd and gbpusd you will see they look like they should crash down here soon with the usd release. I see double tops. This is what good timing is all about. Tonight we will see if signals agree and then ride this train all the way south boys. One way ticket to the wknd

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
Thank you! Slowly but surely learning.

You're right, both pairs are poised to fall off a cliff. If not tonight, then soon! I'll be waiting with my bucket to catch those pips!

Earlier, I shorted GBPUSD again because I got a better entry. Just added NZDUSD.

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
look at eurjpy it is time to start running up

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
I'm with you. Well, a little before you. I'm up 10 pips each on both. Usd release should be positive since there is no war.

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
I cant believe this Douche bag opened up a thread with my name trying to make a name for himself. Someone who doesn't even know my method and how to trade this system trying to take credit for my work and what I have put together.

What a F%^$&*( Tool!

You see how many profitable trades they have shown?? NONE!

They come on this thread and get our signals and pawn them off as theirs and still no profitable trades shown!

Thats why the next system I release will be to a select few. I work hard to put this together and the ones that deserve it and I think are worthy enough will get it. I personally don't care what people think about it either. This is an open forum with people from all around the world. We cant all be the same and conduct ourselves in a certain manner either. Like I said im a business man with a short fuse sometimes. There is no successful business owner who doesn't. Im not some kid sitting behind a computer trying to make a million overnight.

Anyway, news was a fake. Holding on to positions and short on all yen pairs as well. Have a great and safe weekend and see you guys back on here Sunday night.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
This is a great start. Stay humble and safe with trading. Learn from your mistakes this week and next week you will be even better

Shame on such type of people. we should show respect to our teacher and creator(Enzo) of this system Navarra System.

I swear to GOD before joining Navarra System, my concept was not clear at all, but after using Navarra System, now i am confident and i am earning money and enzo always taught us when we made any mistake.

I have double my account in one month.

With no war in Syria with us the dollar should strengthen now. We should be looking for a good opportunity to buy usdcad and usdchf. Sell eurusd and gbpusd. All yen pairs should be weak. Euraud and gbpaud are set up for longs. This week should be great for trading and stick with signal until you get a major change in direction. I feel like there will be long swings of 100s of pips and don't want to miss any of it

will bear those setups in mind, lets look forward to another trading week.  i will continue to post my brief updates about my trades.

go to colour tab  change

1 to Dodger blue width to 5

and

2 to red width to 5

AFTER THAT U SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

The 1 hour template should help compliment the 4H. Another good way of doing it is changing the 1 hr template on the 4H template so you have both systems in 1. That way you don't have to switch back and fourth between templates. Thats how I have mine set up now

Some really nice setups taking place folks.

NZDJpy sell

GBPJPY sell

USDJPY sell

CADJPY sell

CADCHF SELL

CHFJPY SELL

EURNZD BUY

GBPCHF SELL

EURJPY SELL

Now, I would p[lace just one 0.01 trade on each of these for now. Market wont be moving much until tonight but it would be a good entry point. Also im short on AUDUSD. Later tonight I will place more trades for better potions if price has retraced and im in the negative for even better entry.

Keep an eye on these pairs.

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Secret codes with no proof? Another enlightened trader who has millions in the bank and wants to help all of us? No examples? No proof? Just words? C'mon man.

Move it along now. Either post trades with navarra system and try to help others here or boost your ego and nonsense on an other thread. We are all here to help each other learn the system. You haven't even posted a chart with Navarra system or shown any kind of support. This is the kind of stuff that makes me ban people for posting nonsense on this thread.

Lets keep it clean and learn! Post trades you are taking, thinking of taking, analyzing, lost, won, etc.

blamshakk, cheataddict, abdulaziz, furt, and bonkers. I appreciate you guys posting trades and learning together. This is what this thread should be about. Traders who are here for business, to learn and make money. Nothing else! It's about making money and being successful at it where hopefully one day we can just retire and live off of forex if we learn to control our emotions and trader demons.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Thanks sir Enzo,

Your kinds words are encouraging our energy level to learn more.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
I trade live and use standard lots so I usually don't open more than 3 trades at once so that my account won't explode if things so south. I also tend to close trades when they're 30-50 pips in profit rather than going for 100+ pip home runs, depending on trend strength. It's just personal preference. I'd rather have 10 30-50 pip winners than 1 200 pip winner.

So far I like:

AUDUSD short (in now)

EURNZD long

GBPCHF short

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
Yes I also trade live but no longer with standard lots. Drained me too much with my style of trading. I trader smaller lot sizes and open up multiple positions and close out all different levels. Allows me to bank more pips and doesn't mentally drain me if I'm down a 100 pips. To each his own.

Be careful not to jump in too soon  market is a little boring now till Tokyo/ Sydney open

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Thank you for being a part of this journey

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
thanks for your words of camaraderie enzo

yes lets share the knowledge of this powerful system together and go forward

one day as you  said if we can beat our forex demons we can wrestle financial control. i am reading 'trading in the zone' now by mark douglas, its making  lot of sense in terms of where i have been going wrong before in terms of psychology.

any other pointers from the forum members would be great

I want to share a few things that have helped me as a new trader.

Set small, realistic goals. Like:

30 pips a day

100 pips a week

5% return a month

- Don't get caught up in all the fancy lingo, indicators, complex charts, "forex gurus." You'll just confuse yourself.

- Have a thorough understanding of forex basics

- Keep things simple

- Risk/money management

- Discipline

- Don't have a short term mentality and try to double your account overnight. You can think of your trading account as a retirement account that you're managing.

Let's say you open an account and deposit $20,000. If you managed to get a 16% return every month, you'd double your account twice a year. 20k > 40k > 80k

A 16% monthly return with this system is easily doable. Even a 5-10% return would be amazing.

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
Thats right. That's why I trade smaller. A couple years back I would trade 1-2 lots on a trade and tried to make as much money as possible. I was able to make close to $40,000 pretty quickly. I got very greedy and thought I knew it all and figured the forex out. Boy was I wrong. Now, I have a much better understanding of it. Took me 7 years only. Now, the forex pays for my SUV, cell phone, mini vacations and my fiancée engagement ring which was a pretty penny. I'm hoping in the next 5 years with improving this system and staying humble I can make a full living off of this.

Patience and timing. Patience and timing. Patience and timing. Instill those words in your brain when you're trading. If you can control these two factors you will be golden. It's still a major problem with me but not as bad as it was before.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
totally agree

for me most important think is risk/reward

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
tough monday for me, I was bullish on GBP and stop loss hit on GBP/USD, GBP/CAD,GBP/JPY.

still short on:

USD/CHF

USD/CAD

USD/JPY

Seems to be ranging the market today and that killed me...

Did i underestimate de Japan bank holliday??

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
never trade on a holiday and from whot i found out monday is not a very good day to trade we dont know the direction of the market yet. AM KINDA SICK THATS WHY I DIDNT REALLY POST MUCH TODAY

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
Yes you did. We said last night market had no clear direction and mixed Signals so it was better to stay out. When a bank is closed it's best to wait. Live and learn buddy. Now you know.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
Feel better buddy

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
THANKS BRO

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
I'm going to post something interesting and why you need a larger stop loss to trade 4 hr and how to base your trading more on price action as well

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
Heres two charts, 1H and 4H. Last night I placed trades and really didnt want to say anything since I didn't want anyone else following trades since market was a bit choppy. I also had trades open from over weekend and closed out some of the ones that were profitable. At one point on my AUDUSD I was down 140 pips! EURAUD down 120 pips. Now It's important to increase your stop loss on these volatile pairs because they move so much. There has been times ive been down -110 pips on eurnzd only for it to come back and close out with 80 pips profit. Same thing has happened with other volatile pairs. If I would of close these trades last night I would of taken a loss. I read price action on both of these pairs and saw price was reaching a previous low or high that was pretty hard to break through. I waited to see if price was to break through these zones and then I would of closed the out. Since price bounced out of zones and of course had to reverse anyway to fill gap, I stayed in. Price always comes back to fill gap and these two trades are examples. So, Dont trade to large where a -140 pips will scare the hell out of you.

Price action is important and key areas of support and resistance are very important. Price will go my way with all these trades I believe

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) released its 2013 triennial survey of the FX market in early September. This survey measures FX market volumes over the month of April and, as its name suggests, the survey is performed once every 3 years.
HSBC analyzed the data from the report and outlined some major takeaways on the current volume, composition and demographic structure of the FX market:
1. FX Volumes Surges:
FX volumes have increased significantly since 2010. The average daily FX volume in April 2013 was an astonishing 5.3 trillion USD – 35% higher than the 4.0 trillion reported in 2010. This continues the trend of strong growth in volumes seen since the 2001 report
2. USD Primacy:
The USD remains the dominant currency in the FX market (Chart 3). The USD is involved in 87% of all FX volume. This is an increase from the 84.9% reported in 2010 and represents the highest market share reported since 2004 (where it was 88.0%).
3. EUR loses, JPY surges:
The consolidation seen in USD-based volumes has not been seen in the other major hub currency: the EUR. The EUR saw a decrease in market share from 39.1% in 2010 to only 33.4% in this 2013 report. This is the lowest market share reported for the EUR since its inception. The JPY, in contrast, increased market share from 19.0% in 2010 to 23.0% in this report. This increase was particularly evident in USD-JPY volumes which increased by more than 70%; much more striking increase than EUR-JPY volumes, which increased by a more modest 33%.
4. Where is the market?
Unambiguously, the FX market revolves around London. Since 2004 the proportion of the FX market which is executed in the UK has steadily grown, and now stands at 41%. This is in stark contrast to the proportion executed in the US, which has been relatively stable over this period (currently at 18.9%). The other major change in geographic distribution is that the reported volumes from Singapore are now larger than Japan.
5. Who is the market?
The FX market is overwhelmingly and increasingly the domain of financial institutions. Despite the significant volume growth reported in all FX instruments, traditional FX volumes by non-financial customers actually decreased acrothe board in this survey. Non-financial customer trades now constitute less than 9% of the overall FX market. To put this in perspective, the 2007 survey reported that non-financial customers were responsible for 17.8% of the market so this is a dramatic change.
6. Interbank market is the ultimate generator of all FX liquidity:
As in 2010, the volume reported with other financial institutions was the largest category. It might be tempting to interpret this finding as evidence of major market-making banks somehow ‘losing out’ to other financial institutions. On the contrary, this is evidence of more efficient trading operations within the major banks.
7. Who are these ‘other financial institutions’ anyway?
The other financial institutions category is subdivided into the following: non-reporting banks, institutional investors, hedge funds, official sector and ‘other’. Of these subcategories, non-reporting banks execute by far the largest volumes (1.3 trillion USD per day). Perhaps surprisingly, the official sector (central banks, sovereign wealth funds etc) constitutes only 1% of overall FX volume.

Mr, Enzoo What do you think about this chart Buying CHFJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
I didn't open any trades tonight. I don't see any setups that I like so I'll wait.

USDJPY looks like it'll go short soon.

EURNZD on daily is setting up for a nice bull run.

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
it is a good setup but look very well you will see there is a monthly r1 very close consider buying if it gets pass it

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
thank you Bro. always there to help friends .....  yes that's right R1 I just note that, the perice is trying to pass it and I will wait tell than and will see what could happen

EURNZD daily. Nice buying opportunity coming. Price is currently at daily S2 which reversed and went long back in July. Stoch also shows oversold.

TP1 would be daily S1, TP2 daily pivot.

I'm not great at analysis but I want to start posting more charts to get feedback. Let me know your thoughts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Up 60 pips EURNZD long.

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
hi enzo

i have a question. as you know, i am trading original rules ie 7am BST (~1am EST) and leaving the trades to hit their trailing SL using trade manager.

it seems to me there is another time later on after the initial pre-london open trade that people seem to be placing trades, is this the case? please can you tell me if this second round of trades (im not talking about the lunchtime reversals)  is a legitimate time that i am missing out on  or is it just opportunistic trigger finger trading?

many thanks

blam

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
No. Best time to trade is 1am est time. Another great time to place a trade is 7:30 am est time. Other than that its a waste of time and effort.

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
Mixed signals everywhere again tonight. This week really sucks.

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
Managed to squeeze a few pips out of EURNZD but that's it!

yup. Everyone is waiting for big news tomorrow. Should get better a little later but im going to bed. Another long day for me tomorrow.

selling USDCHF AND USDJPY AFTER THE RETRACEMENT

Closed out USDJPY for 30 pips.

GBPUSD NZDUSD looks ready to tumble..

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
damnit! Again, I take a huge loss! This is what happens when you listen to news! Everyone keeps saying the FOMC was going to be good for Dollar due to tapering. They sucker everyone in to believing it and then...BAM! They go the other way. WHY? Because this game is manipulated. You really think they want us to win? HELL NO!

From now on no more news! No more Listening to other threads or watching CNN. We will trade what we see on chart without assuming. Now, back to calming my mind and getting ready for tonight's trades.

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
I'm also guilty of doing this. I was short USD/JPY but I closed out, against my better judgement and went long because I listened to news. Burned me for 50 pips....

Lesson learned.

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
GUESS WHOT GUYS I TRADED WHOT I SAW NEVER LISTENED TO NEWS

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Congrats buddy. You're doing great!

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Enzo, I totally agree that the news is used to manipulate but one can use that to your advantage. Before any major news I close all positions that could be affected, Chose the pair that is most likely to have the most movement then, 2 minutes before the news I place 2 pending orders, one 10 pips long and the other 10 pips short and the SL for both where the price already is. As soon as the price triggers one of the pending orders I close the other one and TP before the retraction.

--- 帖子 #1254 ---

OK lesson learned in the sweet way this time

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
Yes, since the news has passed and everyone has gotten the jitters out of their system, we should see more liquidity in the market.

US session is also notorious for ranging. I've had most of my losses during that time.

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
You happened to be on the right side of the news. Lucky.

You're also doing a great job, keep it up!

--- 帖子 #1258 ---
Great evening my account just strolled up by 20%.

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
Cheataddict, You b Correct guy! So did I sir...so did I. In my case i HIT Aud/Usd & Usd/Jpy HARD!!!

By way of introduction, I am not new in dis thread BUT I decided to TAKE THE TIME to read the WHOLE thing from the BEGINNING so as to come up to speed without interrupting any of y'all.  So far so good I think dis works - thanks to enzo.

I use a slight variation of enzo's system (SLIGHT bcos I am NOT into squiggley lines - I am MORE of a COLOR-CHANGE kinda guy so ALL I changed was the TDI; mine is color-change based NOT lines - HOPE Enzo doesnt mind too much) Besides that everythin ELSE is just like Enzo showed.

Hope we make the Mullah.

NB: As for the craziness prevalent on the charts now, I think its just a ploy to SHAKE off the small time traders! It will still go in the OPPOSITE direction soon. If not dis week, den most def - Next week.

Ok, dats all - enuff rambling.

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
Cheataddict great job man! You sticked to the game plan and system. Well played sir. Well played

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
It's not quite time for me to look for potentials trades for tonight but what's everyone's view on the market as of now?

Are there any pairs with setups forming that you like?

Let's get a little discussion going to see if we can make some cash.

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
I went long on eurgbp and short on gbpchf. Everything has moved too much and want to see how they react tonight. As of now I'm up 36 pips and riding it all night

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
One more short on CADCHF. Thats what I see.

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
There's also CHF, GBP, USD news later.

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
Hmm, are you using daily charts for confirmation?

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
If we r 2 go by WHAT d charts say? - THEN there isn't goin 2 b any sensible setups just yet (except if we aren't lookin @ d H4 anylonger)...

you are welcome bro

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
I've been fighting the urge to buy USDJPY.

I feel that GBPUSD, NZDUSD is maxed and should come down. Slim pickings on the 4hr right now, most pairs are ranging at S/R levels.

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
look closely at USDJPY it is just a pullback to retest where price breakout from my opinion i want to sell

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
lets wait for confirmation

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
This was a couple of hours ago when I wanted to buy, to catch some pips on retrace. Would've been up 30 pips or so by now.

What do you see on GBPCAD?

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
I agree. It's a wait and see game right now. That's why I haven't entered any trades.

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
lets just wait and see

Hi

I´m on fire today, banked:

long eur/jpy +92

long chf/jpy +65

long aud/jpy +65

still open:

long eur/usd +27

long aud/usd +21

short us/cad +21

Maybe I should not had open the CHF/JPY due libor rate decision but JPY pairs work amazing whit NAVARRA (for me)

I decided not to open GBP pairs due retail sales but GBP/CHF was a great setup.

Done for the week +360 pips so far, +12% of my account .

I hope you got similar (or superior) success.

EURUSD IS going down

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
G/U is starting to go down, it's stuck at pivot level but if it breaks past, i'll short.

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
eurusd is stuck at montly r2 now like it was back in FEB 4th.

Watching price action on one minute chart it seems to favor down. Ive been seeing how price reacts on lower charts before news and this seems to be pattern. Usually im already in a trade so am able to analyze only. Today I was finally able to trade this and see if it really works.

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
it seems to be another good one to short based on my new theory. Indicators don't match up yet but based on PA and how its reacting on lower timeframes it wants to go down as well

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
Today might warrant one of your "BIG MONEY" posts!

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
How price reacts before news based on my new theory. As you can see its pushing down... i believe from the heavy selling. This is a one minute chart

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
LOL not too sure yet. I only post that when I feel a 100% :nerd:

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
Also look at the angle of the TDI. The thing I like about this setup is that the entry price is excellent.

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
Hmm, look at GBPCAD. I wanted to short it last night but I din't pull the trigger. I need to get better and stop over thinking trades.

I think both GBP and EUR going up

eur broke 1.34 AND 1.35... could reach 1.37 (i´m taking profit on 1.36)

GPB retraced because of the news but 1.60500 WR2 and WS2 seem to be a good resistence (I had no trades on GBP, just a though).

Anyway, I´m in forex for only 1 year so...who knows.

Hello,

Im very new to forex, and found your system very clear and good to use.

You said that you went AUDUSD short, but all indicators are pointing towards long, arent they ? Or I am missing something completely and being naive and stupid?

Dont be angry and rude please, since im very new.

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
you are on the right track you are not missing anything. he is shorting based on PA

--- 帖子 #1322 ---
Right! I shorted AUDUSD based on PA

I also shorted EURUSD and most of yen pairs and came out pretty nice. The only trades in negative are my AUDUSD. Again I jumped in too early on Sunday. When am I ever going to learn about SUNDAYS! I should start having my fiancee slap me in the hand on Sundays for a couple of hours to keep me off of market

watch out with TP and SL on long GBP/AUD and short GBP/USD cause you (we, i´m in on both) are trading aganist and pro GBP...

Hey people

im also long those NZD pairs today  - looking like strong trades ( althout i did get in slightly late, 7.30am BST as opposed  to 7am as metatrader kept crashing - arghh - hopefully shouldnt make too much of a difference though

question - i am trading strictly original rules, but getting the feeling of being locked out of otherwise good trades as i need all 3 lights on my dashboard to be the same colour

are there any exceptions to the dashboard? eg if the bottom two are same colour then its ok, if all other indicators match?

i noticed you are selling cadchf even though the stoch's  on the dashboard are green.  in your opinion is the dashboard not so important? as i thought previously that it was locking me out of trades that otherwise looked very good.

thanks

--- 帖子 #1343 ---
It isn´t important for me, i don´t use it at all, see post 1344.

--- 帖子 #1344 ---
thanks for the feedback furt. i can see your setup is more stripped down, and i recall you have been  firing off trades at 1am EST? thats when i also take my trades.

can you tell me how this setup is working for you? as in light of these findings, i am strongly thinking of dropping the dashboard as an entry criterion... sometimes its random as well in my opinion, eg the trade looks bullish and 2 stars will be red for example.

--- 帖子 #1345 ---
it works quite well for me so far, you can drop it, i think even enzo, the CREATOR of this system doesn´t use it.

--- 帖子 #1346 ---
I USE IT BUT THE FORCES WAS TOO MUCH THAT I COULDNT RESIST IT

--- 帖子 #1347 ---
this is y i took the trade was;

look at the probability meter it is all red

goldeneye is all red for M1 to W1

daily tdi down

4hrs down

two macd red

--- 帖子 #1350 ---
hey cheataddict do you find the goldeneye indicator to be useful? i've hardly used it so far

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
if all the timeframes are red except one  or two lower timeframe is green i will consider shorting

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
hi every one,

EURUSD and USDCHF are strongly negatively correlated, so actually you took double risk trade.

Check: http://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/correlation

Moreover, if I were you I would look for the nearest support/resistance before taking trade. There's very strong support at 1.3470 (EURUSD 4H), so probability of success is insignificant.

Best regards and happy trading!

Hi, I have only one question.

How do you find the pair you need? You look at the fx reactor and see the strongest/weakest ones and then start looking at them?

You look at the news?

--- 帖子 #1373 ---

Trying to install the 1st verison of navarra system ....obviously unsucessfully: i have distorted image of the grapfic as others have . I have read thru the whole forum for solution.....Install windows font...(done that)...Reset system (done that)...it just dun work.

I have checked the journal saying  "The Profit Goldeneye EURJPY,H1: Product authorization is in process. Please wait..."...It seem that when i open the Mt4, it want me to product code/password .  Qns : Do I still need to use this indicators ? Can I totally remove it ?

Thanks for the advice.

I took a huge loss on gbpjpy. About 800 pips. Just bought audusd and hoping to make those pips back. Was away from computer and wasn't able to close out until Too late.

--- 帖子 #1416 ---
That's too bad, happens sometimes. I made a decent profit (about 100 pips) from your recommendation. I appreciate all that you're doing here. JPY just crashed with seemingly no reason, but that's forex for you...

GL on the aussie trade, I'll ride that with you as I continue to learn / use this system.

--- 帖子 #1417 ---
is anyone still trading this?

--- 帖子 #1418 ---
Stay tuned... Had a baby...opened up a restaurant... created new system...

hey enzo any updates thanks

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
Still fine tuning but looking good. It's two systems in one so trying to make it simple to understand and explain. So far system has a 80% win rate with 96 winning trades and 26 losing trades. It can be better and the only reason it's not is because I have been experimenting

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
many thanks bro , looks like its really shaping up

can you give any more details like timeframe?

blam

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
Daily, 4H, 1hr
