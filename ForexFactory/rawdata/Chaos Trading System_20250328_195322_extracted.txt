Hello There, I read with great attention and joy this thread : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=26044 And I was wondering if some people are interested to discuss about Bill William's system ? I'm trading Forex and trying to wrap my mind around this Trading system. Hope to be abble to share with all of you ! S.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Hello again, To tell you a bit more of what I'm doing : I'm looking at Euro/Usd, cable, Doppy, Usd/Cad, Aud/Usd and Eur/Jpy, On Daily, 4h, 8h and 30m. So far, I only took signals on 30m charts and only the fractals. Why only the fractals ? Just because I'm learning and implementing the system, bites by bites . My mind is slow ! So far, entries are fine but I really have problems with stops and taking profit methodology... I'm trying to clarify this aspect... I'll try to post charts asap and hope to discuss with you about that. S.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hello here's an entry on Eur/Usd 30m The fractal trigered for a short. Let see how it evolve.... S.

Fractal Short Entry on Eur/Jpy 30m.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Yes, definetely interested. It`s kind of funny that there are many threads here lately with variations of BWs systems, but few posts on the original system. Thanks for your coming posts. Forex37

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hello Forex37, I'll try to stick to the original system as much as possible ! Eur/Usd and Eur/Jpy trades are looking good. I believe we are in a trend, so according to the system, stop must be a close above red line.... What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
A potential long trade on CAD.... Let see....

--- 帖子 #8 ---
The Cad trigered, let see...

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Stars I look forward to your posts. Can you post a chart of the CAD trade? How do you calculate your targets and SL?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hello Lava, Here's the chart. For stops and Target, I'm not clear yet.. I'll try to figure out a plan and will let you know. As far I understood there's no target in this system, but different ways to move your stops according how the market is moving : For instance, if we are in a clear trend, we exit the position if the bar close above/bellow the red line. I'll write down all the conditions and let you know. S.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Here's the development of the Eur/Jpy Trade is closed because bar closed above red line. Obviously, we can squeeze more profit from this trade ! Entry : 136.06 Max DD : 29 pips Max move : 125 pips Exit : 135.97 Profit after closed: 9 pips !!! Need to reflect about that ! S.

hi well done. can u post your template pls. Nerry.

Hello, Entering a trade is generally a piece of cake... I personally found the exit much more difficult ! Don't you ? That's why I decided to talk right away about taking profits. Of course, we will discuss along the road the entries signals, but please, find below a first draft of what I understood so far on how to take profits. Techniques for taking profits : - The price bar close above/below the red line (Teeth) For a short trade, in a trending market, we wait for the bar to CLOSE above the red line. We want the price bar close above the line, not just penetrating the red line. Imho, this stop is really good for a really trending market and maybe for longuer time frames than 30M, ie, 4H, 8H, 1D... waiting for the close above/below the red line may keep us in the trade, following the trend... On the 30M, waiting for that situation often just give back a lot of the profit to the market, but I saw some good exits with that. Need to refine and compare with other exits signals. - 5 consecutive bars of the same color When AO and AC are both of the same color for 5 consecutive bars, we want to place our stop 1 pip + spread above/below the 5th bar and trail our stop from bar to bar until it get touched. I saw this signal on 4H, 8H and 1D. But I never saw 5 consecutive AO and AC bars of the same color on 30M... Maybe 3 bars maximum... - The green line stop Same as the red line stop. We use it when we do not have the 5 consecutive bars of the same color situation and when the price runaway from the lines. We do not want to give back to much profit, so, we use the close above/below the green line stop. - Signal in Opposite direction When a signal appear for going long when we are in a short position, we close our current position. This is the leastdesirable exit, because it gives back a lot of profit... Any comments ? S.

Hello Nerry, I'm using Ninja trader and I do not have any specific template. I just applied the indicators, with default values on the chart. S.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks for the reply, i thought as much. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
The bar closed above the red line, so we closed the trade... Entry : 1.3389 Max DD : 0 pips Max profit : 100 pips Exit : 1.3348 Profit : 41 pips We need to find better exits... Any comments ? S.

Hey, I have taken your image showing your short fractal entry and have added where Bill Williams, according to his most recent book, would have taken his trades and put his exits. In order to get the most out of the Chaos trading method in the volatile forex market, get his Trading Chaos 2nd Edition. It explains the Bearish &amp; Bullish Divergent Bar entry that gets you into the trade much faster. Additionally, review the guidelines for fractal entries. You don't have to wait for a fractal to be triggered outside the Alligator's mouth. The first fractal formed above the red line, but was triggered BELOW the red line. That's all that's really necessary. So, even if you didn't enter off the Bearish Divergent Bar at the top of the chart, the first fractal would have gotten you into the trade much faster. There were, probably, some Awesome Oscillator trades, too, but I couldn't line up the chart well enough to see. (By the way, Williams doesn't actually use the Accelerator Oscillator anymore.)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hello Tomy, Thank you for your answer ! It shows me a completely different landscape ! Very very useful ! I'll study your indications carefully and I should receive the book today ! Your exits are based on an oposite signal only, like Div. Bar and fractal ? I'll continue to post my charts when I see a trade. S.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Starskovsky, There is another new element to Williams's style that is not in Trading Chaos 2d edition. I have picked this up from other trading chaos threads and message boards... Williams now uses an additional moving average on his chart, that he only uses for exits. It is a 5 period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the close, shifted 3. Routinely, it is colored purple. If he is in a long trade, once there is a close beneath the purple line, he will exit, if he hasn't already exited the trade and gone short on a bearish divergent bar. The same holds true for a short -- once a close happens above the purple line, he exits. That is, again, if he hadn't already exited on a bullish divergent bar. I attached a chart to show the purple line. The long trade would have been closed by the purple line. The short trade would, actually, have already been closed and a long position already initiated on the bullish divergent bar.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks a lot Tommy ! This really helps ! I love clear exit signals like that. I'll study that carefully... I'm still waiting for the book to come ! S.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Starkovsky, I took your USDCAD chart and put in the entries that Williams would take, now, to show you how much earlier you could get into the trade. I put an arrow pointing to the Bullish Divergent Bar. Your first entry, at "1." on the chart, would have been one tick above that bar. The second entry was a fractal entry where the fractal formed below red line, but was triggered above it. The third entry was after three green AO bars. Again, these newer methods will help you get into positions much, much earlier than the original Trading Chaos method. Good luck. Edit--- Oops, I realized that I put the line for entry #3 (three green AO bars) in the wrong spot. I'll correct it....

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thank you very much Tommy ! Regarding the exits, are you closing the trade on an opposite signal ? ie, if you are long, close on a bearish DB ? Thx J.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Well, in keeping with his own philosophy of "wanting what the market wants", Williams either uses a close on an opposite divergent bar signal, or a close on the other side of the purple line. This allows him to stay in the trade as long as possible, and to catch the new move as soon as possible. Having said that, nothing is perfect. The trading chaos method is very effective, and a huge money maker in a trending market (as nearly any trading system is). It's the choppy, trendless markets that wreak havoc on most systems.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thank you Tommy, this makes sens... I will continue to work and learn ! S.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Wow... can't believe it's been so long since I posted on the factory.. must have been busy or something . Anyway, just thought that I would put up a chart showing some recent Chaos entries as per Bill Williams that could have been taken (no, I didn't catch them all).

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hello, I noticed in different discussion about divergent bars that the angle between price and aligator is important... do you guys have some tips and tricks on that topic ? Thank you very much S.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
The previous bar (see attached chart) was also a zone trade and it looks like the current bar may also turn out to be a zone trade if it closes as a down bar in the next 6 hours or so. (my broker time). Just a comment about divergence bars and angulation. According to Williams (if I understand him correctly), angulation lines are drawn from a price bar within the Alligators mouth following price highs/lows to the divergent bar and another line is drawn along the slope of the mouth (blue &amp; red line). If there is a good angle between the two lines then there is valid angulation. Personally, I find this to be somewhat subjective and am not a great fan of this particular technique. From simple observation, it seems to me, to work best when a divergence bar prints at the end of a longer trend leg (impulse wave - maybe elliot wave 5?) than when a divergence bar prints after a short trend leg (elliot wave 1?). I suppose this is just one of the uncertainties of countertrend trading that we have to contend with.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks for the thread Starskovsky. Since coming across it today, you tempted me to start posting again and that started a bit of reminescence. Came across some old notes to myself when I first started to investigate the Bill Williams approach. I have attached the first little bit. It's kind of funny reading ones old writing but I am pleasantly surprised that most of it still holds true for me. As always, I can only speak for myself and hope others can enjoy. Well, that's it for me for the evening, hope your all catching that nice move (zone trade) we are having at the moment.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
FxHermit, Thank you very much. I'm happy if this thread tempted you to post again. I really love this trading approach and stated this threat to clarify my mind and hopping to share with others what I'm considering as a good system ! I received the 2nd ed. book today, I will have to read it and then will share what I understand. All the best ! S.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hello, Yesterday night I received the Trading Chaos 2nd ed. and I read quickly the DB bar entry conditions. This morning, very proud of my new knowledge, I saw this trade entry on euro 4H. Any comment ?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Starskovsky Thank you for this thread, I'm a big fun of Chaos. I'm attaching a PDF that may be can help. I'll post some trades tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I don't want to put a fly in the ointment but..... The divergent bar in the 4hour timeframe seems to me to be a bit to soon after a breakout (see chart). I personally would be hesitant to trade it as it could easily prove to be a first retest of the breakout and consequently be a bit of a shallow countertrend trade. That could make it a bit of a nail biter. However, I could just as well be wrong. My wife says that I am on occasion . I see Chaos trading as a trend trading approach therefore my favourite part of the strategy is Zone trading because it is when we see the actual impulse wave under development. In my humble opinion that is where the money is to be made. So, I tend to go very light on the countertrend trades and prefer to let them prove themselves before getting on board. The real ones usually give you plenty of time to do so. I have taken the liberty of attaching some of my previous thoughts on the matter and I think that for the most part they still ring true for me.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thank you very much for the pdf ! And Fxhermit it seems you are right for the DB on euro... Today I mainly read the book and took a nice 125 pips on usd/cad 30m on a fractal breakout. I also developed an indicator for Ninja, showing the DB bullish and bearish. Need to test it and refine a bit. I'll continue tomorrow... S.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Great stuff Starskovsky we do have to thank Bull for the PDF.... thanks Bull! Yeah those divergence bars can get a bit tricky especially as one moves into lower timeframes. There they can appear more often and not always in the right place - well they are always in the right place as far as the market is concerned - just nor right for us. Anyway, since I was talking about zone trades in the last post I thought that a couple of charts might clarify why I like them so much. I won't say to much because I think that they are kind of self explanitory. The markets that we are having lately have just been superb for this kind of trading. On the Daily timeframe we are currently 3 bars into the Zone and by the looks of it still going strong.... for how long is anyones guess. Luckily with the Chaos approach we don't have to guess. P.S. I found some notes that are a sort of complete rambling about my thoughts when I first started to look at the Bill Williams materials. They are a bit disjointed. I will try to clean them up a bit and maybe post them at some later date. Just for the hay of it, eh?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hello Fx Hermit, Can you explain the conditions to enter a zone trade ? And how do you exit ? Please. I read about zone trade trade in New trading dimensions and it's interesting because with the zone, the trend seems kind of confirmed. Thank you very much. S.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
...is this a zone setup (GU)?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hello Bull, I read your pdf and it is a really good one ! But, I have a question : It is said : I checked with the book and yes it says that Bullish DB must appear on a red AO, but nothing about the position of the bar, nothing about being below 0 (opposite for bearish DB). Where does this rule come from ? Maybe can you tell us more ? Thank you very much for your help ! S.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello ChowClown, Has far as I understood the zone trade, yes, this looks like a valid one. We have the 3rd consecutive bar, same color on the AO and AC... The red zone start after 2 consecutive bars. S.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yes this pdf is a very good and complete (aside of pink/purple stop line) presentation of the system. And much better structured than the book. The AO position rule regarding DBars is not mentioned explicitly in the book. But it is not a rule, its just the natural definition and outcome of the angulation of a Dbar: you can`t have a bearish Dbar below the alligator or a bullish one above the alligator. By this -and the angulation rules- these "additional" rules are just a clarification of the obvious. Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hello Forex 37, As it is said in the pdf, I have the impression of AO red bar must be bellow 0 line of AO. Of course, DB bullish bar will be bellow the Alligator... Wich is implicite as you said. My point of view is that just AO as to be red, no matter if it's above (AO positive value) or below (AO negative value) the AO zero line. What do you think ? S.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
On the attached chart I have indicated a couple of bullish dbars that occured when the AO was above zero. In each case the AO bar was red - so my guess is that the criteria for those dbars were fulfilled. Although the subsequent waves were not overly long (that second one was followed by quite a choppy market), it was possible to make some pips from the dbars. I guess some dbars will be better than others - that's just a part of their characteristics. I suppose its just something that we have to learn to work with. When they occur in a good place in the landscape they can be very effective as witness the bearish dbar (second chart) that was the initiating event (there's that Butterfly Effect again) for the monsterous downtrend that developed afterwards. P.S. I haven't forgotten about discussing Zone trading. I will get around to it a bit later. P.P.S. I like how this thread is beginning to evolve. Lets hope more folks come on board and leave their comments.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi fishermit, on the second chart the last red one BEFORE the one you marked is a typical Dbar. On the first chart only the last red bar before the last one marked by you is a Dbar - to my opinion. Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Did you survive the 200 odd pip drawdown on your 4 hour dbar trade? I see that it has just gone into the money now. Was a bit of a nail biter for a while there. I just had a silly thought as I am writing this. Converting the dbar into a Balance line trade, that is , not taking the dbar immediately but waiting to see if it becomes a Balance line trade would have negated the drawdown somewhat (see second chart). Maybe we are onto something here that could help us tame those dbars. Would have kept us from chewing our nails too . Will be interesting to watch this one evolve.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Ho ! I forgot to repport about the DD on euro 4H ! No Hermit, I went out way before that ! I was to scary to stay in... Actually, the price went to exactly 2 pips from the stop loss... I'm not to familiar with balance line trade, but I can see what you mean... Counter trend is sometime scary and to have a filter for the DB might be a very good thing. I wa also thinking of waiting for the AO entry signal... as a confirmation of reversal. I'm not posting charts thoose days because I'm pretty buzy with some coding for Ninja Trader.... Yes, me too I appreciate very much the way this thread is evolving ! Very interesting people here ! Hope it will continue for a long time. S.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Forex 37, I will have to dig out my Williams books and a do reread just to refresh my memory about what a dbar is. Currently my understanding is that a Bearish dbar must print a higher high but then close within the lower half of the bar showing that the bears have wrestled control away from what started out as a bar with the bulls in control. If I am not mistaken, what is known in price action terminology as a pin bar (James 16 thread) would be as close to an ideal dbar as we are ever likely to see. The opposite would be true for a bullish dbar. That has been my thinking all along but you have given me the incentive to do a little reread. Thanks. Looking forward to more of your posts.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
fxhermit, You are exactly right about that. And it is very similar to pin bars on the james16 chart thread.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
This morning I took a trade on cable 30m. A Bullish DB bar. Angle was good, candle was good. The only thing is the AO was green already. I took it anyway and managed to grab 70 pips. S.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Here's my last EU Trade, closed a few minutes ago, hope that can help.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi again, Here you're the First WiseMan signal Indicator, This indi only show us bull/bear divergence bar, but please keep in mind that the indi don't meet the rule for the AO and the angulation, only show the bar that meet the rules (current bar lower low &amp; close in the upper half /// higher high &amp; close in the lower half) The Second WiseMan appear after the third green (or red) AO bar.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Congratulations!! Very nice trade following W1 signal

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Another on Eur/Jpy, took 130.... Just don't have the courage to stay in... Will try to re-enter on another signal. I hope thoose charts help a bit. Thank you for everything Bull ! S.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Another good Trade, this time was USDCAD. In the chart you can see 4 W1 signal, and may be you'll ask you why I only take the last one???, Easy, following the W1 rules, we must to set up a Sell Stop 1 pip below the low of the signal candle (in this case because is a Bearish Divergence), and the only one that trigger the order was the last one (any time that we've a new W1 signal, we remove the old pending order). I hope that this can clarify something.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
can someone post template for this system?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thank you Bull, This is a "by the book" one ! Very usefull to see it on a chart ! S.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Yarally, You can find indicators here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=50 Enjoy ! S.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi everybody, I'll try to show step by step, today trades in EU. Please look at the chart below, here is the explanation of all trades: 1. Here we've the last Valid Down Franctal, why?? because is the last fractal below the Alligator. Value: 1.2735 2. Our first trade, following the W1 (bullish db) we set up a Buy Stop in 1.2797 with a SL in 1.2756. As you can see this was a loss trade. Total loss -41 pips. 3. After the loss trade we have another one, but at this time is a Short trade. Reason of trade, the down break of the last valid down fractal. Entry point at 1.2734. (1 pip below - see point 1.) 4. A few hours later, we've another W1, again a Bullish db, What we do at this point, we must to set up a Buy Stop 1 pip above the high of signal candle (1.2580), AND in the case that this order will trigger we need to close our Short Open Trade. 4bis. In the next candle, we're going on the oposit direction: Close the short and open the long. Summary of short trade: opened at 1.2734, closed at 1.2580, Profit pips +154.- 5. Now we've a W2 signal, remember that this is only a add signal, we set up a new Buy Stop at 1.2632. On the next candle we've 2 long position. 6. Here we've a good area for close all long position, because the price is on the Jaw and take a look on the Gator, it's closing his mouth, that mind that the movement are lossing force. Then we close all at the Jaw value (1.2736). Sumary long trade: 1) Opened at 1.2580 - Closed at 1.2736 - Profit pips +156; 2) Opened at 1.2632 - Closed at 1.2736 - Profit pips +104. Total of day: -41; +154; +156; +104 = 373 I hope that this point of view help to somebody.

Hi Bull, Very nicely done explanations of those recent trades and a great way to show the effectiveness of this system. It is nice to see your posts and your generosity of sharing. Your posts should be very enlightening for anyone following this methodology. Thanks and great to see you on this thread.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Bull perfectly clear ! And so useful. Thank you very much. S.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes, I agree, very nice post and explanations. The effectiveness is even greater, if BWs MM system is followed. Could we also include the stopline (pink/purple line) which was introduced by BW after TC2? Thanks Forex37

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Just some braindroppings regarding Chaos trading. Enjoy.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Bull, I only have one small comment about the chart you posted. Williams, in his books, states that it doesn't matter where a fractal is formed, only where it is triggered. With that in mind, I have circled the last valid down fractal according to Williams. True, it did form within the Alligator, but it was triggered well below it. I only point this out so that anyone using fractals as entry points will be able to get into the trade as soon as possible.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Nice one...but it a pity that doesn't include any pic example Sonic

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thank you Fx hermit, very interesting. You have here the premise of a nice ebook S.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
At market open Red Zone trading criteria are still in effect on the Dailys and have been for a number of previous bars. Need to watch for an over extended market though. The do not add on after 5 consecutive bars criteria is in effect - manage any open positions accordingly. Stop loss should be at top of 5th bar.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Sonic, Yup, you are right. When I first wrote this it was meant only for myself so I didn't bother with charts. Don't think that I will bother to add them now though. What will probably happen as this thread develops is that there will eventually be discussions and charts posted around most of the concepts expressed. At least I hope so. There already have been really good posts by a number of people and I am sure we will see many more. I think that anyone who reads this thread will gain some good practical knowledge that they can apply directly to their trading.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks S., Good thought but I don't feel quite that ambitious. I think most of it will come out in the wash, so to speak, as this thread develops.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Just wanted to point out the difference between price feeds from one broker to another. The last chart that I posted was from GCI Finance which prints a Sunday bar and this one is from Strategybuilder fx which has a different end of day closing time from the other. Here the same Red Zone criteria are also in effect, however, we are only on bar 4 so technically this is still a valid setup bar for a Zone entry. This could bring a bit of confusion into the trade if you are silly enough, like I am ,to look at two (or more) data feeds. I would certainly like to hear other opinions on this situation. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
.... Edit:...+50 now and counting, stops now at b/e on this counter trend move.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Tommy, First of all I want to apologize for delay to answer your question, I was away during the weekend, now I'm back. As my point of view, and following the BW ideas, you have 2 types of Fractal Signals: WISEMAN FRACTAL: This break it's only an add signal, like W2, on this signal no matter where it form and execute but ONLY we take it after w1, w2, never can be our first signal. BREAKOUT FRACTAL: This other is a main breakout, and can be our first signal but the Fractal must be form and execute outside alligator. With all of this in mind, we have the following options for entry points: ENTRY POINTS: BREAKOUT FRACTAL: Fractal formed outside the alligator. This is Trend Entry. WISEMAN 1: Signal generated by a Divergence Bar. This is a against Trend Entry, trying to catch a new trend since the beginning. After we're IN the market, we've ADDING signals: WISEMAN 2: Add a position on the third AO in our favor (green for bull, red for short). WISEMAN 3: A fractal breakout, no matter where the fractal formed. I hope that this can help you. Sorry for any mistake in my redaction, English isn't my first language. Bull

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi ChowClown, Great Trade!!! If the third AO green will formed (in the next candle) we can add a new position. (Wiseman 2). I'm personally when add a position, I set for the 50% of the 1st position, that mind, if my 1st was 1 lot, all adding positions will be for 0.5 lots. I'm on the some boat to you!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Good summary in your previous post, Bull. Thanks. I'm new to Alligator trading and I like the way each stage builds. A nice and clear, KISS approach

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Another good example on EU. On the below chart you can see the last 2 trades on EU. The first one was a Trend Trade: Entry Reason: Breakaout Fractal at @ 1.2512 Exit Reason: A W1, counter trend trigger. Closed at @ 1.2392 Summary: +120 Second Trade: Entry reason: W1, Counter Trend. Opened at @ 1.2392 Exit: Till open Summary: +60 and going I love this system

--- 帖子 #74 ---
...in your experience, where are you most comfortable with a W2 initial stoploss?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
If the current candle close now (I've High 1.2465 and Low 1.2441), and confirm the third AO green, I'll set a buy Stop at 1.2466 and a SL at 1.2440 (by the book, 1 pip above high for in, 1 pip below low for exit). Remember that at this time we've our first opened trade with a SL at break even.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thanks Bull. Get the feeling price is at make or break level at the moment. We'll soon see Edit:...glanced over at EJ and the 30min W1 is currently up +200...marvellous. Typically, wasn't in on that one! Edit:...hmm the EU 30min W2 trade would have been stopped out using my MT4 feed (WHC). Decided to take the next fractal break rather than the W2, as high probability of reversal for a while from here i think, triple top printing perhaps. Edit:....30min short W1's setting up across the board now. (EU, GU, UJ, EJ).

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Ok, bar closed, W2 confirmed, then BS at 1.2469 - SL at 1.2440. A few second later the new order was triggered and now we're in with 2 positions. I moved the Sl of the first position to the low of next bar where the position was opened, new sl 1.2413 What we can hope that happens: Scenario I: The counter trend becomes the trend, and we would be inside from the beginning. We'll see the price above the Alligator, and adding positions by W2 and W3.- Scenario II: The counter trend finishes and returns the original trend. We'll close all counter trend positions, and we'll open a new trend positions following the Breakout Fractal Signals. Will see what's going on....

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Yes Chow, when I was writting my last post, the sl of the w2 was reached. And now, the last upper fractal (2 bar left) it's now an invalid fractal for W3, because we need to be in with w1 &amp; w2, and we was stopped out with W2. The only option that we've to open a new long position is a new W2, but for that we need that the AO change to red, and then to green, and on the third green bar set the new Buy Stop. For the other side, if will be stopped out with our current position, and the counter trend finish, we've a a valid down fractal at 1.2334 (5 bar left)

Hope you're on the mend Stars! I missed the W1 short at the hourly trendline, still asleep. W2 now setting up.... Edit:...W2 triggered but daily pivot holding price atm, plus price action since yesterday's low has been higher highs / higher lows. I'm reducing risk now to just above the high of the last 30min candle (sl 5608). Edit:...W2 trade now stopped out.

Hello, Feelling a bit better today I took this DB trade on CAD... Edit : Took 100 pips out of it

--- 帖子 #82 ---
...nice trading, Stars. I'm in off W1 on the EU 30min...perhaps i'm clutching at straws...don't have a good feel yet on which W1's are best to take. Good fun learning though.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
ChowClown, I hope you holded it ! Getting better now. S.

Hello there ! I took few trades today and was to scared to stay in... Anyway, took 55 out of that... S.

2 other fractal breakout this morning, on the 4H this time. Edit: All position closed at noon EST : +300 pips... Would have been much more if I've found the courage to hold the trade longer... Work in progress ! Patience....

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I wonder if this thing will A,B,C corrective wave its way back to the Balance line or if it will show a 1,2,3,4,5 impulse wave as the initiation of a trend changing wave 1, althought there is no divergence of the AO. Or maybe...... none off the above . Only time will tell. Meanwhile, the Balance line trade is in play as per the book, entry level is breakout of the second bar back from the base bar. So far so good.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
The same trade as posted above seen in the 4 hour timeframe as a fractal breakout above the Alligator. There is also a Balance line trade just under the fractal, giving us what Williams calls a "blue light special". It's nice when the charts "nest" like this. Oooops!.... almost forgot to mention that there was a nice bit of divergence on the AO that is associated with those two beautifull Dbars right at the bottom. A lot of "heads up" leading into the trades.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Early on in any trade, I like to be very agressive with my stop loss. Currently protecting about 70 pips and counting. Will begin to give it some breathing room from here. The active bar shown just triggered another fractal trade as well with another "Blue light special" Balance trade just below the fractal once again. I guess this is why Williams considers chaos trading to be an aggressive approach. When the market is running, there are no lack of opportunities to trade.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
The balance line trade looks very interesting too. I would like to look at it also, as a potential filter for the DB trades... What do you think ? S.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Compare this chart to the previous and we have the reason why I like to be aggressive with my stops early on in a trade, especially on countertrend moves. They can often be more volatile than impulse moves. Still managed to take home some pips though.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Balance line trades as described in "New Trading Dimensions" can be a very effective technique especially when used within an impulse wave. They essentially get you into a trade at the pullback areas often at a better price than a fractal breakout. Basically they allow you to take advantage of what is a pivot that initiates the resumption of a trend. Takes a bit of practice getting used to them especially since Williams has a number of different setup criteria pertaining to where price is in relation to the balance line. Once you start to see them, they do kind of start to jump out at you. I don't believe that Williams mentions using them as a filter for a dbar but it does seem to have some merit. One of the ways that I like to use them is to begin marking Base bars after a fractal has formed as a way of identifying eventual price turns. I particularly like to do this on a Daily chart, however it works well on the 4 hour and 1 hour too. Make sure that the entry bar is at least at the two bar back rule. Try it on a clean chart and see just how effective that can be at identifying turns. This attached chart shows quite well how a Base bar entry eventually gets triggered after a move away from the latest fractal. As to whether or not it proves to be an initiating point for a good trade is only something that hindsight will reveal to us. P.S For those who are serious about Chaos trading, I would certainly recommend owning both TC2 and New Dimensions - money well spent.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
The following chart gets a bit messy but I hope it illustrates the possible use of Balance line trading as a filter for dbar trading. Please be aware that as far as I know this is not Williams methodology that we are talking about here. It is just something that we are trying to work out on our own. The filter would have worked quite effectively on the 1st dbar, keeping us out of what would have turned out to be an ugly entry. The same holds true for the 2nd dbar. The filter would have kept us out of a lot of sideways chop and out of that "here we go - here we stay" nail biting. We would then have had a pretty "clean" fractal entry along with a simultanious Balance trade entry on the 3rd dbar. Even our previous Balance trade setup would have proven to be effective. Don't know where angulation fits in all this as that is not one of my strong points. This is something that I am certainly going to keep an eye on in the future. Any discussion around this topic would be much appreciated. Don't be shy - we are all here to learn from each other. That's it for me for today, profitable trading to all of you Chaoticians.

Today trade 3 lot &amp; made 110 pips profit based on fractal breakout (Wiseman 3)

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Looks like we could be seeing that ABC correction in the Daily timeframe. Also has the potential of being a valid trend change althought the Alligator and AO indicate that the downtrend is still intact. There is also no divergence in the AO as may happen at the end of a trend. Meanwhile, hope that you Chaoticians out there have been scooping up those pips in the lower timeframes - there have been a good bunch of them as KLKOO has been kind enough to point out. P.S This thread has gotten rather quiet as of late, lets hope it doesn't die out like the other chaos threads in the past, that would be a shame as this methodology really can bring home truck loads of pips for those who apply it diligently.

Yes, you are right, hope this thread will continue ! Sorry for not posting anything, I was sick, but will come back and post asap ! Starskovsky

Today made 2 trades (1 Win &amp; 1 Loss). Net gain 15 pips. Trade 1 Analysis: The trade didn't move accordingly &amp; had been stopped out. The mistake which was made is the initial stop loss didn't move to the next down fractal to minimise the downsize loss Trade 2 Analysis: Didn't let the profit to run &amp; close out the trade early &amp; miss a big move as shown in the last candle How is managing the winning position effectively &amp; maximise the profit gain? What is the best method?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hello here's a trade I took this morning. I close it too soon... Just took 50 pips out of it. Need to learn to stay in longer... I checked my past trades and I noticed I'm staying in about 30% to 50% of the whole move... Better than nothing but I can definitively improve there.... Any suggestions ? S.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Nice to see you back. Hope you are getting well fast. If you are getting a part of the move then you are obviously doing well with your entries and initial stop loss. Have you tried adding a 5ema of the close offset into the future by 3 as a stop loss guideline? Might help you to grab a few more pips as the move progresses. Seeing as how you are trading down in the 30 minute timeframe you may have to be a bit more nimble in your trades. You may find yourself getting in and out a bit more often than us guys who work mostly the longer timeframes.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I usually only use lower timeframes (let's say 30 min) for timing my way into trades that favour what I see in the daily timeframe. This helps to reduce the initial stop loss and sometimes adds a few more pips to the overall move - always a good thing . Seldom do I trade using the 30 min timeframe as the primary one. I would rather use it as complimentary to the further out Daily. This may cut down on the number of trades that I take but often gives me the higher probability ones and keeps me out of the weaker ones in ranging markets. In running markets it allows for a very nice way to add on trades. I have attached two charts to show how this might work in the currently ranging market that we are in. The Daily has been marked up with support and resistance lines (yes, I still use them) and the AO, although green is below the zero line so I am only interested in shorts. The AC is red telling me there is acceleration to the downside. Even though in the Daily we are officially in the gray no trade zone, if I were to look for trades in the 30 min I would only want to take downside signals. So lets look at the 30 min chart. The possible downside trades (Fractal breaks) are marked. Most of them were not triggered. Number one at first may look like a valid fractal break but I would prefer that entry complies with a red zone signal which it does not (AC is green). Number 2 (which happens to also be very current as I write this) has all of the valid entry criteria. It is in line with the Daily, Fractal break is outside the Alligator and both AO and AC are in the red zone on the trigger bar. Let's see what happens from here. P.S. Starkovsky, The dotted line is the 5ema that I mentioned in the previous post and as you can see is already protecting profit very early on in the trade. It can sometimes take you out a bit prematurely especially in ranging markets. In a running market I may only use it to get me past the breakeven point very quickly and I will then look to using the Alligator lips (green line) or Alligator teeth (red line) as a guide. But hey, one can always re-enter off the next Fractal or other signal if everything still looks good. A profit is a profit and I figure that must then be in keeping with "wanting what the market wants". Anyway, that's my rant for the moment - see you later Alligator

--- 帖子 #100 ---
As I was saying, it's easy enough to get stopped out in a ranging market (especially on a retest of a fractal break) but it was still good for 25 pips . A break of the next Fractal would still be a valid entry (at least as things stand now).

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hello Fxhermit, Thank you for the advice. Are you out of the trade when the candle close above/below the ema or just when price penetrate it ? Thx S.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Early in the trade I will exit on a penetration. If the trade develops in my favour by a good amount then I am happy to back off a little and let a candle close above/below. Stop loss management is probably one of the most subjective parts of trading. As you well know, even Williams has several approaches. I personally haven't found any single approach to be the ultimate and perfect way. I just try to evaluate each trade on it's own merit at the time and use what feels comfortable to me at that time. Choppy markets, as we are currently experiencing, are particularly challenging. In the lower timeframes we can be subjected to quite a bit of noise and less than perfect entries, making S/L management even more difficult. That is why I am of a mind to use the "patience" indicator and wait for more trending markets (more hungry Alligator) to develop and then trading aggressively. I am happy to leave the crumbs to those traders who don't mind being glued to their screen trying to catch a few pips here and there. Like the Alligator, I am after the "main meal" . Williams does say that Chaos trading can be applied in most time frames and does mention using the 30 min but he also states (can't remember off hand which book) that he makes the greatest profits trading the Daily. I wholeheartedly agree and actually use both time frames with the lower as complimentary to the Daily in order to improve timing. Besides, I initially learned to trade that way as a beginner and still feel most comfortable using multiple timeframes in that manner. I am getting a bit wordy now (my wife says that I talk almost as much as she does ) so I better sign off for now. All the best.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hello Fxhermit, Thank you for your answer. I like you being wordy ! I would like to ask you some questions. Regarding your entries on daily TF, are you waiting for midnight ? Or are you anticipating the signals before going to bed ?? How are you doing ? Did you switch the open session time to a more easy hour ? I will definitively trade log time frames, I'm really looking forward to see some entries there ! But, I like the 30m too and I'm catcing some good moves there too. Not today ! It was really choppy.... In term of multi time frame strategy, if I understood well, you are checking the trend direction on the daily TF and taking trades on lower TF, i.e. 30m, in the same direction only ? is it correct ? Thank you very much for your help ! S.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Good questions, let me begin by posting a couple of charts. As you can see from the Daily chart, I have a preference for Zone trades (both AO and AC the same colour). It takes a little patience to wait for them as the markets do not always give us those impulse waves. I prefer the ones that trigger outside of the Alligator. Once a Zone signal appears on the Daily, I then like to drop down to a lower timeframe such as the 30 minute and time the entry. As you can see from the attached 30 minute chart, that helps to minimize the initial stop loss and improve the reward to risk ratio. It can also have the added benefit of adding a few more pips to the trade - always a good thing. One of my broker's end of day coincides with what is usually accepted as the end of day for Forex, that is 5 pm EST (New York time). That is early afternoon for my time zone (1 pm). My other broker's end of day is at 8 pm my time zone. That gives me lots of time to watch for any possible retracement in the 30 minute and then simply take a Fractal break in the direction that I want to go. Sometimes that keeps me up untill the European session. If the Daily signal bar is small enough to allow for a reasonable stop loss then being the lazy sort that I am I will just set pending orders and leave it at that (keeping in mind good money management). There are a few advantages to setting pending orders: 1. cuts down on screen watching time. 2. keeps you out of the market if an inside bar or some such should form in the Daily. As an example: look between the two vertical red lines on the 30 minute - see the area of consolidation - now look between the same two red lines (the close together ones) on the Daily - voila - two inside bars in a row. Had I taken a Fractal in the 30 minute, I would have had to ride out the chop for two days and praying when the AO and AC reverted back to green . There are also some disadvantages of course, with larger stop loss settings being one of them. This can be addressed somewhat by adjusting position sizing to keep within acceptable risk. Anyway, that's how I approach it. Even if I were to decide that the 30 minute timeframe was going to be my predominant timeframe, I would still think that it would be good common sense to use a higher timeframe as a way of identifying what the market is trying to do. It would not necessarily have to be the Daily, the 4 hour can also be very usefull. Unfortunately, Forex trading is not as cut and dry as we would like it to be so please forgive me if I also sound a bit ambiguous at times. Gosh...did I make sense with all that?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Yes, it makes sens ! Very good explanation. I'll have to wrap my mind around that.. I'm installing a MT4 platform with a broker providing a new bar on D1 at 5pm my time. I'll try to observe what you discribed above. I'm not so familiar with MT4 and I tried to use the indies provided there : http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=50 But when I'm trying to apply it on the charts, nothing is happening... No wiseman indic. on the chart. Can you help me please ? Thx a lot S.

Ok guys, forget my MT4 problem, it's solved... S.

Hi all, I am a bit confused by this thread, as it seems to apply many techniques from TC1 and NTD like Zone trades, balance line etc.... which are not mentioned anymore in TC2. So, is NTD a valid addition to TC2 ---- OR --- is TC1/NTD a valid alternative ot TC2 --- giving us 2 valid systems? ANy hint where to find an mq4 painting the balance line or identifying the zones? Thanks to all Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #108 ---
best way to trade this system is using the mechanical method described in Trading Chaos 2nd edition and optimize that by counting waves pretty easily as described in Trading Chaos (1st edition I guess)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hello, Here's a trade I took today. A fractal break out entry. I took 140 pips out of it. There was same type of trades on many pairs this morning. CAD, NZD, AUD, E/J...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hello, I changed the open bar time for the D1 charts. It's now 9am est. It's more easy for me to trade like that.... So, this morning, there was this bullish DB on the cable. Let see how it evolve....

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I've read the entire thread. I see a good consensus on when to enter trades but I am seeing different opinions on when to exit. Knowing when to take profit and not letting emotions get in the way are difficult. I would really appreciate feedback on this from seasoned traders! Thanks for all of your posts and teachings thus far! D

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yes Denver, you are right ! Exits are quite difficult to optimize.... What I'm trying to do now is to trail manually my stops. I'm looking mainly at high/low, sup/res and even numbers and bottom/top of the 3 previous candles. My weakness is to trail too fast, to put my stops to close from the current price. I'm working on giving enough space to the market, to let it breath. I'll keep you updated with this cable trade. Stop is currently 1.4628. A little bit below the signal candle and below 1.4630, an even number... Just a work in progress... Any comment appreciated ! Have a good trading day.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hello, Get out of cable trade, with 60 pips loss. For a DB entry, thought it was taking to much time to take off. So, I decided to close the trade. Yesterday, I took a long CAD, on a fractal break and grab 250 pips on it. I'll post the chart later. See you. S.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I'm still short on that GBP you took also.. can't wait to see how it turns out.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
.. now we have 2 BDB on the hourly chart .. looking pretty good in respect to going further south

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hello here's the CAD trade I took. +250 pips

--- 帖子 #117 ---
that was quite a trade you took there.. AO showed that in comparison to the previous high there was almost no momentum left .. meaning divergence develops and then south.. glad you made it out with quite a gain =)

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Sorry, on previous chart, AO was wrong set up. Here's the good one. S.

even more happy with USDCHF 2 entries: first one is up 600 pips, second one about 330 pips ... and cable was just triggered.. so what we see right now is only the beginning of something great I hope edit: visit my blog for charts etc. @ arcus: Bill Williams in Stocks and Commodities this year: "Most traders enter and exit too much."

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hello Slight, I looked at your Blog, and I'm not so sure to understand which BW's signals are you using to enter ? The fractal for sure, also you talked about the DB. Are you using the AO signals (saucer ect...) ? The balance lines ? And, are you using the AC indicator at all ? I guess not... Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I use fractals (on different TFs), AO for counting waves and the Alligator for a rough orientation. No AC and all of that stuff, balance lines?! If you want to know more you should tell me what exact trade you are talking about then I can post pics to explain.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Oh ! I don't have any particular trade in mind ! Just asking to wrap my mind around your work.... Anyway, any charts are welcome ! And your explanations are always interesting ! I'm mainly interested by the Elliot Waves in relation with the AO... Thx a lot.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
simply put: AO is at it's peak when you have a wave 3. If it doesn't cross the 0 line and then gains momentum again, but doesn't reach the peak of wave 3, you have a wave 5 of 3 that ended (= entire wave 3 is finished), after that AO crosses 0 line - look to place a trade when that happened, and then doing a wave 5 without the AO reaching the peak of wave 3. After that a 5 wave sequence has been finished and you could look for a turning signal. Anyhow, this is nicely explained in the link I gave you with charts illustrated. my chart is the EURUSD, which I placed a short order on right now. Let's see how it turns out .. you can clearly see in the AO what I explained above.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thank you Slight, I'll read materials about AO and waves during my holidays and will come back with my questions and chart posting in January. All the best wishes for the coming new year !

--- 帖子 #136 ---
e.g. in the EURUSD chart I posted above we know today, that this wasn't the end of a wave 3 as I assumed, so my short was never triggered and price went higher. You could've gone long at the high of the previous move, I didn't do it though.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hello Slight, During my holidays, I read the Book #1. Very interesting ! Mainly the "counting the waves" part. A bit complex too, but seems very very good. I'll have to read it several times... Now, that I read the 3 books and I'm a bit confused... I will ask you more questions ! lol : Does the AO replace the MFI + MACD ? Thank you very much for your help and happy new year.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Counting the waves is pretty easy, you just have to get the hang of it. Don't bother about MFI and MACD, the techniques you use primarily for Trading are the ones described in Trading Chaos 2nd Edition. You add to that only the wave counting methodology of Trading Chaos 1st edition. Forget about everything else.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thank you Slight. I'll work again on the count during the next coming days. Trying to be ready for the new year. This system looks so good. Congratulations for the Swissy trade !

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Congratulate me when I am able to produce this kind of result on a consistent basis =)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Practicing, practicing and practicing... Then it will come. BTW, at what time is your new daily bar open ? I setup mine to open at 9am EST. Good time for me...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hello Slight, your trades look fine. however, I am counting the daily GBP bars as a start in wave 5 down. so i guess you are a bit early with a bullish trade setup. btw your website is very interesting, good info. regards

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hello WoodenShoe, Is it possible for you to post a chart with some comments ? Thank you very much and happy new year.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
wave 3 is the big one (AO) btw look at divergence in AC

--- 帖子 #145 ---
you might be right wooden. But then again, check out the 2h or 4h chart.. AO has not been supporting this move down at all .. no momentum that builds up, but constantly decreasing .. that's also why I dont have a sell below the last low.. but it's getting really close now regarding my stop .. well, we'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I count the move of 12/4 to 12/17 as a corrective one on the 2HR chart. 3 waves. you are completely right. we assume, plan our trades and use stops. we can't win them all, but sure we try.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
so wooden .. I got knocked out .. but wtf there will be a divergence bar on the 2h and 4h chart in 25 mins I think .. what now .. I dont know what to think of this really .. lacking momentum in the AO is confusing me .. while I have to say you are right about the wave count on the daily. edit: did you enter short ?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I was not on GBP until I read your comments. however did you see EUR 2 and 4HR charts. looks promising short.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
hm .. see picture. I think newer high first. Would you agree?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
dunno. I put a sell stop at the low of todays daily bar which can turn into a bearish div bar. it could be a wise man setup, but there is not to much angle.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I decided to short it too .. but below the fractals on 4h chart. This is a 4th wave I think .. correcting more.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
hi,slight and others I think the Wave 3 should make AO pull back to 0 level but not cross it, isn't it? Correct me if I am wrong. Happy New Year! asam

--- 帖子 #153 ---
No, it's wave 4 that need to cross 0 (min requirement).

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hello, Here's a chart. I'm training myself to count the waves. This is the first result of my brand new knowledge. My problem now is to identify the end of the W5, and also to find the point 0, the start of the W1... Please, if you have any comments/questions.... Fell free.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
count inside waves to find the last wave of the wave 5 you are trading. look for a divergence in the AO and a reversal signal

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hey Slight, To find the inside waves of the wave I'm trading, I have to look at a lower TF, is it ? So, for the 30m, looking at 5m. For the div on AO and reverse signal, this should also occur on the 5m ? Thx ! I'm happy, all of this seems to start making sens to me...

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Here's what I'm thinking for cable... Alligator is not really nice, but we might have a W5 short if fractal trigger. What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
maybe, maybe not. I am not sure about cable .. if it's a wave 5 down on the daily I wonder why it only dipped below it a little yesterday but didn't continue and break it more clearly.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I understand. Let see what will happen.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
thank you for the answer.

Hello There, I'm reading with a lot of fun the BW's book #1. It is really good ! But I have some difficulties with the concept of 100 to 140 bars in the past to count the current wave... I'm a bit lost. Can somebody explain a bit how he/she is using that ? Thank you very much and all the best !

--- 帖子 #164 ---
are you using metatrader? because with this trading platform the number of bars is already set to between 100 and 140 in the standard view. The whole point of this 100 - 140 bars is, that the wave you are looking at needs to contain this number of bars or the AO will not be accurate. The way I do it is: I look at the monthly, what wave am I in (roughly)? Then I go to the weekly and see what wave that is (if it's a different wave, if the timeframe is not significant lower, you will not see a wave of another degree, but the same wave with the incorrect number of bars on the chart). Then I switch to the daily to see what wave of the wave of the weekly/monthly I am in. From the daily down now you have to manipulate your timeframes in order to see the wave of the daily. Sometimes this can be seen in the 2h chart, sometimes in the 1h or lower, depending on how far the wave of the daily has developed already. E.g. on your 1h chart there are 40 bars in the wave you want to examine closer --&gt; so you need 3 times that number .. you would go to a 15 - 20 minute chart. Note: Imo with this approach you can't just say "Ok I am trading the 10 minute chart now", because you might not see valueable AO information on the 10 minute, because the wave needs to be looked at on the 5 minute. Often times the differences between the smaller timeframes are not that huge, but I would always start with a high timeframe and then go deeper and deeper into the waves to know what you are really in.

So, on the 1st Time Frame I'm looking, the highest one, as an example, let say the 4h, I don't look between 100 to 140 bars ? I look more in general, where I am, even if the waves I'm counting exceed the 140 bars ? Then, I go down, on lower significant TF, let say 1H first, I have to look where I am in the 100-140 area. Then in the 140-100 on the 30 or 15min ? Did I understand correctly ? Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
no I think you didn't get it look into trading chaos 1st edition and study the three charts where BW examines this problem. He goes from a 1h to a 15 mins to a 5 mins. It starts at the top page 125 and follows the next 3 pages..

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I'll post some charts now. If somebody can correct me, I'll be so happy. I'm just reading the charts for now, not placing trades yet. knowledge is too new... Heres 2 charts of the usdjpy. 1st one : 4H I assume a wave finished, we are in a b wave down. 2nd one : switching to 30m (I cannot really decide what is happening on the 1H) I assume W5 might be finished, we are in the a wave up So, are we in the a wave of an b wave ? is it the right way to read it ? All the best and wish you successful trading.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I think I got it. You always look for a 5-waves series developing between 100-140 bars. You start by a big Time frame and go down until you find the waves series matching in the 100-140. Then when you have it, to go inside the wave, you try to look at a lower Time frame (about 5 times smaller), also matching with the 100-140... Doing this, the AO information is accurate (Peak on the W3, Xing of 0 line for a min. W4 req., divergence on W5). Am I right this time ? Thank you for your help.

I'm trading on fractals for few years. Most important you have to understand what the fractal is, and how to use them, and wich fractals are profitable, and give you dirrections of the market. Most indicators, show you history, they are to late to give you a trade signal. Alligator and Fractal will give you thru signal

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Can you explained in much detail?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hello ForexFG, Happy new year and I wish you good trading. Fractal and alligator are great, I know that, but counting the waves with the AO give even more reliability to the entries, I think. If you have a chance, do you mind to post few charts with some explanation ? That would be useful ! Thank you .

--- 帖子 #172 ---
The AO is a very good tool to see what wave you are in .. not always, and it doesn't tell you to short here or there - but it gives you the most perfect overall idea in which direction the next trend is going to move. So it's not historical in a sense at all .. of course you see the peak a little later than it occurs, but that's not important at all because trends end in divergence in the AO. However, without the fractals this wouldn't be of any value. Yes starskovsky your explanation of how you should do it is right. But remember, if you trade the dailies you couldn't care less of what is happening on the 1h or 5 min chart. You are actually always only interested in the wave of the TF you are trading. Otherwise you will enter and exit too early all the time. If you trade intraday, it is probably the best to know where you are on a 5 min chart, because it's the TF you are trading. However, if you trade the dailies only thing you need to know is where you are in the wavecount on the daily TF. You can look one TF lower to look into the current wave of the TF you are trading .. so you have a better orientation of when price runs out of steem...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I totally agree with you Slight. The Waves and the AO are a very useful map to know where the market is now. Before starting to study that part, with alligator and fractal only I really had the impression of being out of tune with the market song ! Slight, I noticed that I'm liking very much the 30m, with 5m and 1m for the inside waves For studying too it is good because many situation during the day to learn from. But for sure, I'm looking at the daylies too. All of this is so interesting ! Thank you for your precious help

--- 帖子 #174 ---
no problem always like to help remember though when wanting to trade the 30 mins: "Do I even see a wave sequence that helps me determining what the market might be doing next?" Cuz maybe you have to go to the 10 min or 15 min or whatever TF to see the intraday waves ..

--- 帖子 #175 ---
30m, 5m, and 1m seems to work well together... We will see... Next week I'll try to post some charts, to confront my brand new knowledge to all of yours !!! Have a good week-end !

--- 帖子 #176 ---
The Alligator places the AO on the chart shifted by a few bars. Downloaded an indi once called Chaos Gator, which allows you to have the Gator as a histogram in an indicator window. Until you shift the averages, it is identical to the AO (which represents a combination of the MFI and a slightly modified 5-34-5 MACD, just add a 5 period ma to it to get the original buy and sell windows of vol 1). Just a bit of idle observation. Bill says that you can make lots of money just trading the crossings of the AO. The rest of the system seems to be just a refinement of that entry by delaying the entry to cut out the false crosses and adding in the countertrend entry of W1, which is not to say that it isn't successful. Another note: as you shift down to a 100 bar chart the alligator will show you additional details within the waves as well.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello TaxGeek, I'm curious to see one of your chart, showing how the indicators look... Can you post one chart please ? Have a good week end.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I found the indi in my pile of largely useless stuff. Here's a chart with the averages unshifted. Left that way price rises above the alligator (cross the zero line) at the same time that AO crosses the zero line. After you put in the moving average shift, it becomes slightly delayed. The guy who wrote the indi observed that by leaving the averages unshifted you got a faster and earlier entry. I don't think that he realized it was the same as entering on the AO's zero cross. I played with it just long enough to realize what I was seeing and got rid of it. Thought it was kind of interesting and perhaps revealing into what Bill's so called non technical analysis system is actually doing. He's right just trading the AO cross will make money, and if you apply some Elliott wave knowledge to it, so you aren't trading the wrong cross, it gets even better. Remember he says he's refining the entry that you get from the AO.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
hey taxgeek, can I ask you a favour? Could you put up a chart showing a wave you traded and how you applied fibos to see the end of a wave .. and consequently when you would enter again?! Becaue I am sitll unsure how to read or apply fibs to the waves..

--- 帖子 #180 ---
starskovsky how have you been doing with counting waves lately? Here is some stuff I pulled off: USDCHF - 109 today, went short at the bottom of a 4th wave and got knocked out when price went higher to complete w5. EURCHF -got 2 positions, one over 100 pips up the other currently not making money do to correction... EURUSD - closed out 2 positions with a combined profit of 766 pips

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Best thing on this is Robert Miner. His methodology is what I use. Basically you run a projection fib (for long grab the top of the wave and pull to the bottom) from wave say wave 4. Then look at the internal structure of wave 5 and find the minor wave 4 within that and do the same. The two fibs should create a zone at some point (most likely 161.8%). That's the point to watch for a turn, if it continues through it will probably go to the next fib confluence. I also use the absolute fibonacci to further zero in on the most likely turning point ( Inserted Video ). That video is representative of what I'm looking for on the chart. I depend on that more than the fib projections actually for setting take profits. Most likely you will get a wiseman on some time frame, and price will do a 180. Don't just trade on the basis of the zone. Look for divergence in the AO and most importantly price action (preferably a W1). You can find some illustrations of the fib projections in my posts on an earlier chaos thread. I made a couple of trades (non demo) right before the holidays (haven't done much since). They're shown in this chart, but I did no fib projections on those, just used the abfib technique. On a break above the yellow bollinger and red alligator line into a new fib set (price is blue), I went long. I stay as long as price closes above the lower bollinger line or until I reach a really strong barrier and take profit. You will note that the take profit was at the upper purple line on the last set. I then entered short, when it turned back through the first purple line with a take profit at the next purple line. Hopefully that helps some.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hello Slight, Nice charts ! Thank you very much. I'm still studying and things are coming slowly together. This AO is really a pure jewel ! And BW's book #1 is really a gold mine. During this intensive learning period, I'm focusing mainly on euro and cable. 30m, 5m, 1m. And I saw many trades that I took on demo account. I'm way positive. I'm also looking at the D1, 8H, 4H. Now, I think the euro on the D1 is starting a W5 up. I'm placing an order to go long@1.3286 (triggered). This entry might be a bit early... But the lower TF seem to line up for a long. We will see. Please have a look to my chart and, please let me know what do you think. My new D1 bar opening is at 9am est. All the best and good trading.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
glad you are getting there. Well I have something different on the EU. 1. Look at monthly - what you see is the end of a 3 at the last high and obviously some sort of wave 4 we are in now. Let's go to the weekly 2. Weekly - without being sure I would say that in the weekly you see the first leg down being a 3move wave a, the spike that touches the blue line upwards again, is wave b and we are now in a wave c of a wave 4. Let's look at the daily if this holds true. 3. daily - you see on the daily that wave a was a 3move down. then came b which was a clear 3 move up - so now we are seeing a 5 move down for wave c. This first wave of wave c has been finished and we are going into a wave 2 of wave c of wave 4 now. So I am waiting for a pullback and enter short again.. that makes sense?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Ohoh, we are in a totaly different page here... Can you post some charts please.... ?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
here you go ... the order is: monthly, weekly, daily remember: when you are switching one timeframe lower, you are looking INTO the wave of the higher TF

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thx S. So where do you place the W4 on the D1 ? and by consequence, the W5 ? All the best

--- 帖子 #187 ---
what do you mean? the numbers 2 and 3 on the daily are just an indication of where the market moves, it has nothing to do with where it will exactly be going. Thanks taxgeek for your reply and the link, it helped a lot!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Slight, See on my chart, where I place the W4 ? So, on the D1 where will you place this wave 4 ? I hope I'm clear...

--- 帖子 #189 ---
"this w4" ... there is no such thing on my chart as "your w4" .. it's a totally different count. on your chart it looks like you just jumped into the daily chart and looked where the AO is the highest - but you forgot to consider where in the wavecount this daily chart acutally is. only by knowing that you know on which side of the AO to look for a peek or a zero crossing you can determine the actual count

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Oh I understand what you mean !!! I'll dig more in the direction you gave me. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I'm with you on this one. You have to start with the monthly and work down to know the true direction of the market.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi Slight, Your post is always helpful. thanx. asam

--- 帖子 #193 ---
thx

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hello Slight, Sorry to be so heavy... But the a,b,c you marked on your daily chart, did they correspond to the a,b,c of the weekly ? Just trying to situate myself on this map, showing waves inside waves... Thank you very much for all your help !

--- 帖子 #195 ---
yes exactly. this is how you technically zoom into the wave (by switching to the next lower timeframe) and determine the wavestructure more exactly. then you go to the next and to the next until you have what you want.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
So, now on the daily chart, we are looking inside the wave c happening on the weekly chart. A wave c is usually a 5 waves sequence, right ? what makes you placing the wave 1 where you placed it ? Do you think the Wave 1 is over ? If you look at the 4h, it seems to me that the 5 waves of the wave 1 are completed... I'm posting here the 4h... Thank you for all the comments.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
exactly, wave 1 of wave c is over, which means a 1-2-3-4-5 of wave 1 of wave c is over (4h chart). the entire c can't be over yet, because obviously it didn't make a lower low than wave a, did it? plus it didnt show us the peek in the AO yet does that answer your question?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
So, now let's try to project a bit in the future, to see if my understanding is starting to gain some reliability On the 4h, it seems we are in the a-b-c correction after the wave 5. When the wave c on the 4h will be finished, we can expect the prices to shoot up. This will really end the W1 and do the wave 2 of c on the D1. Then, we will look for a signal to trade short the wave 3 of c. I'm not sure the fractal you choose for entry is the good entry point... If I'm right you will have to go through the wave 2 up. Also we might have a better entry price... Does it sounds right ?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
depends on how you look at it. on the 4h the AO has crossed the zero line already - only by one bar and very little though. So far I have been assuming that this was the actual wave 4 already and wave 5 has finished too. So I was thinking we are in a Wave 2 (a-b-c correction) already. But you are right, this could be wrong and wave 4 is what we see right now. But since you can never be 100% sure, you just put in your order and then you'll see what happens 4h chart is attached

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Ok, it seems that we agree on the wave count ! I'm happy. Now let see how it develop. Thx Slight.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I'm also looking at GBP/JPY. MN and W1 seems in a wave 3 down. If we go down to the D1, we can see that we are in the W5 of the W3. To "zoom" in this W5, I switched to the 120m. This down move is well located in the 100-140 bars, so AO reading is accurate. We can see here that we are in a wave 3 of the wave 5 (on D1). I want to trade the W4 on the 120m, so I look at the 30m, we are in W3, I'll wait for the W4 and 5 on this 30m to finish and will take the signal long on the 120m. I would like to know what you guys, are thinking about this counting ? Thank you very much for all of your comments.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I'd say right on.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
good setup . do you have the template for this ? your chart shows alot of information there

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hello, I'm using Ninja Trader... I guess you are talking about a MT4 template ?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
yes , Ninja Trader got chaos template ? i'm using chaos for my trading , but your chart seems so informative ..i can see the divergence information on top ..

--- 帖子 #206 ---
The divergence bar indicator is one I developed myself. I don't want to publish it now because I'm not sure it is really working...

--- 帖子 #207 ---
starskovsky, who is your broker?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I'm looking at the Cable. MN and W1 are in W3 down. But when I'm switching to D1, I cannot figure out where we are.... I know cable is a bit particular sometime but.... Do you guys have any idea ?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
cable finished wave 4 with a clear breakout to the downside today and is now in a wave 5 downwards. this was the most weird wave 4 I have come across in my short time of trading lost some money in their too oh and this is on the daily chart of course..

--- 帖子 #210 ---
A wave 4 ??? I'm very curious, how you draw that .... ?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
something like this, but very weird I have to say. edit: and look what would have happened if you longed into this wave 4 .. like I did. no good way to take out a profit. so always be cautious when betting against the trend.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Oh ok, I put top of 4 where you put a, 5 where you have b... But now I see you are right, complex correction this 4 !!! Thank you !

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi All, Hope that you have all been stuffing your live accounts this week. Impulse waves can be a thing of beauty and this one could be used as a textbook example. Just wanted to make a comment on how I go about using my charts. I like "nesting" my charts, by that , I mean using multiple timeframes. Then, I often use simple horizontal support and resistance carried down throught the timeframes in order to delineate the trading landscape. Speaking only for myself, I find that Chaos trading lends itself particularly well to this approach. Impulse and corrective waves uncannily respect these levels. The Alligator and his friends serve up the trades and define the entries. I am currently using the 1 day, 4hr and 30 minute charts. (charts attached) There have been some very nice opportunities to take on and build positions during this wave. P.S. I have also been using William's "Blue Light Special" setups as a way of scalping a few here and there in quick in and out trading - may do more of that till the "gator starts to nap as I am pretty well done adding on positions for the time being.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
...and the 30 minute chart for entry and stop management. Nice how the methodology kinda does the wave counting for you, eh?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Just a quick up date. New support and resistance have come into the market (30 min chart). Guess where? A previous Fractal, of course. Old support has become current resistance. - classic. Trading rules as usual ('gator, fractals, etc.).

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Interesting. I too always thought that support and resistance could be helpful with this strategy, because I noticed that many fractals appear at points of support/resistance. So it does make sense what you said. Thanks for the insight on another way to view this system.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hello FxHermit, nice to see you here ! Thank you for your charts. Very clear. May I ask you, if you have time, to post some charts about "Blue Light Special" trades ? I read about it, but I'm curious to see some examples... All the best !

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yeah, if I remember correctly, William's says something to the effect that - fractals do not necessarily signal the end of a trend but all trends do end on a fractal - so if we can identify those significant fractals then we have a heads up on where to pay attention in the charting landscape and then let the 'gator and friends do their thing. I think that delineating the fractals begining with the longer timeframes and then moving down accomplishes some of that. I personally don't think that there is any need to make it complicated. Just a few of the horizontal and/or sloping trendlines connecting to the most recent one or two fractals should do the trick. Now we have the pleasure of watching this latest corrective wave working its way to completion. P.S. That was certainly a nice divergence on the AO on the 1hr.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi, O.K. I'll work on it and post something later. I've been enjoying your and Slights posts on wave counting - keep up the good work. Insights gained into the underlying structure of the markets is always a good thing, especially when it can be plugged into the practical concepts of chaos trading.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
If I recall my reading correctly, Williams describes several ways whereby one can go "inside" the fractal to initiate a trade. He writes about Thumb trades, Balance Line trades and Blue Light Specials. They all have their own "specific rules" but they also have something in common, that is, the attempt to get into a trade, during a pull back, in order to catch the immediate resumption of the impulse wave or trend. I am not going to mention Tumb Trades as I do not use them. Balance Line trading is a bit of a subject unto itself and I won't delve into it here.So that leaves the Blue Light Special. Although I have been known to use it in my own trading, I will confess that I am not overly disciplined in its use and don't consider it as part of my daily "routine". Even though the original concepts are used, I am also not disciplined about sticking to the rules so please don't confuse this as being completely by the book. The Blue Light Special is associated with one of the usuall entry signals. However, instead of the entry signal being immediately triggered, the market first retreats (pullback) offering a better entry price before then completing the original entry signal. The intention is to take advantage of this temporary situation by going inside the pullback (inside the fractal). If you are looking to sell into a downtrend then follow the higher lows of the price bars as they form the upward pullback. A sell entry occurs when price falls back to resume the trend, hopefully at a better price than at the breakout. The rules say to enter at the break of the low of the most recent bar that qualifies as having a higher low. A non text book variation is to enter at the low of an additional bar back. The opposite is true for buying into an uptrend. I have marked a few past examples on the attached chart. I think that most of them are based on using one bar back entry. As you can see some were more successful than others. In theory, Blue Light Specials can be looked for in any timeframe but off hand I would say that this may work better in the longer timeframes. I have no real track record to back this up, as to date I have used this method only sporadically. Besides being a way to enter a continuing trend, as per William's rules, I also initially thought that this tactic may contain the makings of a Daily timeframe type of scalping (exiting on the close of the bar that puts you into the money) just to more immediately add a little juice to the account on a trade that you are wanting to make anyway. I haven't persued that to any great extent but may pay a bit more attention from here on in. Hope that helps.

Today I'm looking at USDJPY. MN is in Wave 1, W1 is in Wave 3. On D1, I think we are in the wave 5. In order to zoom in this W5, I'm switching to the 120m. This TF shows the right number of bars 100-140. On this TF, I think we are still in the W3 down. In order to zoom in this W3, I'm switching to the 45 min. This TF shows the right number of bars 100-140. It seems that we are in W3 down. So, if we go backward to the D1, we are in a W3 of a W3, of a W5. So, this mean that USDJPY will go down a bit before finishing the W5 on the D1, then I will look for a signal to go long. What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
guys , it seems i am always getting it wrong , can some one hepl me , i am a novice and have followed bill williams theory with interest .Tell me if i am wrong , I always enter when there is a fractal in my direction and thiss is also supported buy 2 consecutive bars (red or green ) in the AO and also the same color must be in the AC .But for some reason , evertime i enter the market it suddenly changes direction.I always put my sstop loss at 60 points away regardles , i stilll dont know when or where to put the stop loss.Am i doin the right thing? i have already lost about £4000 in less than a month, can some one help please.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I have just gone long on the GBP/CHF .AO has 3 green bars above the 0 line, AC has 2 green bars and the up fractal has appeared on 16041.0 .I have put a stop loss on 15941.0 which is 1 point below the sell fractal. If there is anyone watching can you tell me what i have done wrong please , already as we speak , i am 30 pips down.Just dont know what to do.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hello Taf. Sorry to hear about your losses... Maybe, for a while, you should go back to demo until profitable again. It appear that BW's strategy is a bit more complicated than taking fractals with the AO with the good color... I did that too... And you are right it was not working. I mean, all the signals are not good to take. As you can read along this thread, we are discussing about the Elliot Waves, as Bill Williams mention in is book, the first edition. Believe me, when you start to get your hand on this wave counting, your trading improve greatly ! I'm not an expert, far from that, but only with my little knowledge, I can already see a big change in my trading. So, if I may give you an advice, go back to demo, read again and again the book #1 , have a look at this thread, feel free to ask any questions related to this topic, and I'm sure you will find help and you will greatly improve ! I wish you all the best and hope to be able to help you.

On what Time Frame did you enter this trade. Just to have a look...

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thanks for that , maybe i need to read more , but the coincidence that i always lose

--- 帖子 #227 ---
15 minute time frame

--- 帖子 #228 ---
15 minute , or maybe its the time frame?the other thing is i just get confused with when to exit as well. or where to put my stop loss

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Man, don't trade your real money if you are not clear on what you are doing. Quit your trade and go to demo and mess with that! It's cheaper that way

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I have done demo accounts and to be honest , they are different from real ones , there is a lot of emotion involved and also , i seemed to get on with demos well , but the real ones are killing me , i did demos for 3 mnths before i started real ones , i also dont have a friend i can ask when i am trading , so when i make mistakes , i just suffer alone, if yu know what i mean

--- 帖子 #231 ---
There's no coincidence... I think if you don't know where you want to go, nor where to stop, you will go nowhere. With an empty account as a result. Please go back to demo and give a try to this wave counting we are talking about here....

--- 帖子 #232 ---
, i know what you mean but maybe i am abit thick , this wave thing is also a bit confusing , you seem to talk aboiut them on bigger time frames and also when do you start wave 1 ? and whats the relationship with the AOs or the ACs , the trouble is , i have got noone to talk to about these things if i dont understand them , like right now.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
just read the book, study it, try it on charts, intent to understand Bill William's charts .. if anything is unclear, come to this thread. But it makes no sense to tell you everything here. It's all in the book of Profitunity perfectly illustrated with corresponding charts. I really suggest you read it .. its even online as pdf somehwere. Just google a little bit.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I think this Forum is made for that, talking (writing), asking questions about things which are confusing at the beginning, learning and also helping others... So, maybe you should read BW's book, read this thread, test your knowledge on demo and ask some questions on what you don't get right away. I'm sure there will be always somebody to answer you. All the best.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Glad to hear that I'm not the only one trading this method with s/r. And a little bit of EW (can't help it lol) but very very basic EW. Keep on posting guys, this thread is alive once again

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thanks for now , will come back a bit latter on after i revise these books again , maybe i will have a better idea than now.Cheers anyway , if i may ask where in London can i go and meet fellow traders for such discussions , espeecially to do with this Chaos theory?anyone?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Let's hope it stays alive a little more. Would be interesting to see you posting charts with some labels on s/r and stuff. I would also be interested in squat bars and how they occur at the end of waves .. I know starkovsky would too. So arcus, feel free to come here more often and post some of your charts.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes, I'm interested also in squat bars... Is there anybody around with some experience about that ? Maybe it is because it exist no open source indicator for that ? I think it is related to "tick volume". I guess it is "how many ticks during 1 bar" and related to the "size" of the bar.... Something like that. Now, my mind is completely involve in the wave count, but later on, with some more info, I'll have a look if it is possible to develop such an indicator. My brain is already hurting, no more room for anything else than the waves Regarding sup/res, yes it is very interesting too and I'm also looking at the "channels", have look at the chart...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Just updated a couple of my S/R lines on the 4 hr EUR. Alligator going flat with a downside bias at this point. Considering where this corrective wave is in the channel, I'm not surprised to see the 'gator digesting a bit. Always fascinating to watch, at least I think so.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
First of all, welcome aboard. Second of all, all of us had to face the same trial by fire as you are currently experiencing, some survived, some didn't, fact of life. Williams addresses trader survival quite thoroughly in his books, well worth paying attention to. From reading your posts on this thread, may I suggest.... - Go for a walk, relax and come back with a clear mind. - Do read the William's materials and this thread "several" times. - Use a multiple timeframe chart set up. Market waves "nest" within the time frames as waves within waves and are easier to see if you come in from a larger perspective. May I suggest 1 day, 4 hr, 1hr to begin with. Leave the "choppy" time frames for later in your trading career. Don't crowd your view of any particular chart ( a common thing that new traders do - they consequently suffer from "too close itis"), back you charts up a bit so that you see a few days/weeks at a time. The impulse/corrective waves will become much more obvious within the landscape. You will then be able to see more clearly whether the current wave is acting as an impulse or corrective wave. Initially attempt to only trade the impulse waves, leave countertrend trading for later. - To begin with, trade only a single currency pair. May I suggest the EUR/USD because it has the lowest spread and because of its huge liquidity tends to produce the cleanest waves. The GBP/CHF that you are trading is one of the more difficult pairs for a beginner to trade. - If you must trade Live rather than Demo then at least use a micro account and only use one micro lot to begin with. Same real money thrill but much reduced risk. - Practice patience, patience, patience. Trades don't happen just because you want them to. You are in effect a vulture waiting to pounce once the 'Gator provides the kill. - Do realize that it all takes a bit of time and perseverance so capital preservation must always be paramount if you intend to be able to stick around in this business. - Enjoy the comradrie on this forum. and last but not least, realize that more often than not - Simplicity is the seed of genius. Complexity is the fertilizer that it feeds on.

Nice fxhermit, I can see on your chart that my wavecount shouldn't be all too wrong. Seems we are in a zone with a lot of s/r points - for the waves that means wave 1 is finishing right now and today, from now we are going into wave 2 ...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Yes Slight, I think that there may be some potential in corollating S/R levels with wave beginings and endings especially around those areas where former support is likely to become new resistance and vis versa. Something like we have just seen around the 1.3025 area. It is something that I certainly plan to pay more attention to in the future. Meanwhile, as the week draws to a close, I see that the downward bias of yesterday was at least temporarily satisfied overnight (as price moved away from that 1.3025 resistance area and triggered the fractal). The 'Gator gorging an additional hundred pips plus. A full retest of the breakout makes me wonder if we are actually in for a bit more of a corrective phase following this kind of "dirty breakout". Will 1.3025 once again become resistance or.....? Only time will tell, eh?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Couldn't resist posting a few more examples of how, in a down trend, old support once broken becomes new resistance and the birthplace of a new impulse wave. Certainly turned out to be high probability trades. Now if we can successfully transpose this thinking to the "hard right" edge............

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi fxhermit love the your posts and analysis.keep it up bro.I m too new to the chaos trading system and I must say I m hook especially the methodology you guys used.Hope to learn more from this. What is your thought on the gator indicator? If you dont mind me asking.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thanks for the additional charts fxhermit. I checked some of the pairs I am looking at and how the whole s/r relation falls into place. It's really an awesome tool to know where to pull stops to or not. Now I just gotta figure out how reliable which s/r points are and what that has to do with the waves.. I have Robert Miners "Dynamic Trading" here which I am going to study some time - maybe I can incorporate some Fibrelations into that too ...

Hello everyone First I apologize for my bad English. I am new here, but it keeps track of your writing and the first that you want to boast, because you are trying and help each other and especially the people who are new. I am only 20 days began to teach Bill William's Chaos Theory, so far I have used other strategies. On the forex I'm 10 months and I trade live by a little exercise demo. I want you to show otherwise my practice these days with fractals and from tomorrow begin live and I think that this is always a great strategy for us, especially beginners in Forex. Suppose I am waiting for a growing trend, and when I get the top trends and the next candle on the right side starts to fall I will wait another of candle to open down and go to sell and take about 10 pips, just do it same thing when the trend is down to just wait the other on the right side of the fractal starts to grow, (I wait about 3 pips) and enter the bay, take 5-15 pips and exits. When you take 50 pips stop trade for that day. I have a Money Management Plan that each day take only 50 pips but constantly increasing value to the first month of your income (50 pips = 50 euros) but it gradually increases so that after 5 months is (50 pips EUR = 2500) I think that is our brain so fresh that day took 50 pips. Finally you can tray this demo, it does not cost anythyng.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I forgot to say stop loss is if it go in opposite direction and Break the Last Fractal.Here is one example for trade. I use 15 min and 30 min charts.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Nimrod, Glad that you are liking the methodology. Be sure to read all three of William's books if you get the opportunity. As for the Gator Oscillator, William's writes about it in his first book, Trading Chaos 1 but doesn't come back to it in his later books. I think that he probably decided to drop it along the way (he does that with a few other things too). As for myself, I am not knowledgable in its use so I can't really make any comment other than that it is a graphic (histogram) way of describing the Alligator. I am used to looking at the Alligator itself and don't find that the Gator Osc. gives me any greater clarity. However, if it gives you some clarity, then by all means, why not use it - there really are no hard and fast rules in Forex. It's whatever works - go for it. If you discover any cool insights into it's use, I'm sure that we would love to hear about them.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Yes, it is some interesting stuff, isn't it? I whole heartedly agree with you that we "gotta figure out how reliable which s/r points are and what that has to do with the waves". As far as the reliability of the s/r points is concerned I am pretty well convinced that there is a high level of reliability to them. I think that it is so almost just by definition alone. Saying S/R is the same as saying Fractals. I like what Williams says in NTD on p. 43 that "Fractals are the way the markets organize themselves". They are both the beginning and ending phenomena of waves. I think that is why he gives them the importance of being one of his first trading signals. So I have no doubts about their reliability, hence my interest in drawing those silly lines on the chart. As to which ones are of greater importance, well, that's literally the million dollar question. I think that the whole thing hinges on clarifying the nesting of waves within waves to what ever degree is practical for the trader. I am thinking that the best way to do this is may be to use multiple timeframes. Starting with the longer timeframes and moving down into the lower timeframes. The fractals in each time frame should reveal the pertinant s/r for that timeframe. Carrying that down to the next lower frame should give an idea of not only where price has come from but where price is likely to be going. This can then be repeated for the next lower timeframe and so on. Of course, one has to be practical and realize that wave structure repeats itself into infinity so beyond a certain point it becomes laborious to try and follow waves within waves within waves within waves........... I generally work within a grouping of three. I suppose any grouping of three would work but personally I use 1 day, 4hr and 1 hr timeframes for drawing the lines. Any more than that and the charts just become too cluttered with lines. All that I am really looking for are "heads up" areas in the landscape. I am not particularly concerned with the actual numbered wave count but it is nice to know whether price is moving into an impulse wave or corrective wave and of what degree. The s/r lines and angled trendlines help with that, so does the Alligator by indicating whether it is feeding, sleeping or digesting. (every impulse is followed by a corrective and vis versa). I don't mind complexity but I'm always wanting to reduce it to simplicity of application when it comes down to the actual trading. I am quite willing to let the Alligator, AO, initiating fractal, etc. call the shots once I have identified the "heads up" areas. Anyway that's just some of my theory and approach to trading this thing called chaos.

Hi bro, thanks for the feedback.I too cant seem to find any significant on the gator indicator.I have been using the alligator system and until this day I really cant put a finger as to what is the gator for.I have not seen many posts that include the gator.I ll just put it aside for now. I m getting other Bill William book "New Trading Dimension" and hopefully get some knowledge from it.Cant wait to get it. And to all chaoticans in this thread, please keep contributing cos we do appreciate your input on the subject matter.Thanks guys. Nim the newbe alligator.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
There is an overview of Williams Chaos theory posted here: http://www.alpari.co.uk/en/market-an...ory/index.html Hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting this link . P.S. Nimrod, it explains a bit about the Gator Osc.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Since this is the start of a new week I thought that I would post a chart of my recent s/r fractal based trendlines. The 4 hr is my main window, straddled by the daily and 1 hr so that is what I've posted. The way that I see it is that we are currently in a somewhat choppy (flat) corrective wave with a downside bias. Let's follow along and see what happens. P.S Maybe Starskovsky and/or Slight can give us an updated wave count? Just wondering what the probability might be for a trend changing impulse wave?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Here is an updated wavecount, but I only counted until the 1h chart, which means that it could make a new low, for some w5 of w5 of w5 of w5 .. but I am not going down so far in TF, because I've found it to be better to take reversal signals on the 4h or daily TF, which we see in this case is a divergent bar on the daily TF. So the important parts of this chart are exactly where you put in your s/r lines. Wavecount pretty much says, that we saw the end of a wave 5, of a wave 1, of a wave c. Meaning we are going into a wave 2 of c, which might be not more than a boring sidemove. I am definitely ready to short this pair after we've seen some kind of correction for a couple of days .. or 1-2 weeks (this I would do so far below the last meaningful 4h fractal or below the daily divergent bar.)

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Ahhh... good old fractal support and resistance, either it holds or it breaks, both of which offer trading opportunities. Watch the Alligator, take the initiating fractal. The AO helps out too (divergence). P.S. Thanks, Slight for the wave count, very informative and predictive.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
.. and it seemed to be correct too. Check the current analysis on the 4h chart - the lines I drew are just one possibility of how this w2 might unfold. You'll see again how the waves and s/r are working perfectly together. I have a question regarding s/r, fxhermit. On my chart you see 2 circles, a bigger and a smaller one. My question is, can the fractal at the bigger circle be considered a new s/r point, or is this not a strong area (yet?) and we would have to look for the s/r at the fractal of the smaller circle?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Very astute observation, Slight. Here is my thinking on it. Although fractal s/r lines tend to make the s/r look like definitive points, I think it is always best to treat them as areas or zones rather than distinct points ( although, uncannily they do often hold true almost to the pip). So at this time, I would treat your small circle as the more important s/r that would have to be violated. However, by the time we get to wave C, as marked on your chart, the Alligator, AO, etc. combined with a more recent fractal at that time may well give us an earlier entry that may then carry on through that support. I guess, time will tell.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Alright, nice illustrations - that cleared things up, thanks!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
O.K. glad that was helpfull. If I remember my market "jargon" correctly, when one s/r point gives way and then makes a second s/r point creating an s/r zone, some traders call that "throw over". There is also "throw under" when price does not quite reach previous s/r. Then, I suppose there is also "throw up" when the trade goes against you .

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hahah I'll pay attention to it before I "throw up" on my computer and can't as a result not take off the losing position

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Some of what Williams wrote about Balance Line trades and Blue Light Specials may prove very applicable to your approach. May help to keep you out of some of the "nasty" ones and let you take home a few more pips on the good ones..

--- 帖子 #262 ---
hahah really good chart fxhermit especially that I upload what I threw up .. real nasty ... j/k

--- 帖子 #263 ---
guys, am back , have read and understood bw books , made my trade and won 75 pips today .Good for me after losing som much in so few weeks.There is still something though thats stil confusing me about the fractals.A buy fractal may appear sometims whilst there is a reversal in direction , and the sell fractal might appaer after a big move and would have missed early entry.Is it correct to just get in without a fractaal showing in the direction of the trade or we MUST wait for that fraactal to appear?.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
This is usdchf 10min. Good resistance at the redline I drew. Let's see when it's gonna get taken ...

--- 帖子 #265 ---
You made at most 138 pips on that trade today didnt you slight? i have just checked you USD/CHF , it broke support to land at 11407 at 3pm GMT , i was on it as well , well done mate , Keep it up .For your info , i only had £5 per point , which wasnt bad .

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hey tafadzwa02, I didn't even close that trade yet... I was just watching it on this 10min chart to see some s/r action, while I am trading it on the 4h/daily. Hopefully it comes back down. five pounds per pip is not that bad imo

--- 帖子 #267 ---
To fxhermit and slight, Hi guys, I like you guys to know that I really enjoy the posts and comments here.I m hoping that more will contribute in the chaos analysis.As a newbee I really appreciate the input you guys gave all these while. Salute and thanks and keep it up. Nim p.s Where is star? Its been a while since I saw his post.Hopefully to hear from him soon.

He's probably too busy trading intraday and explaining the whole EW thing to people I am glad I can help, Nimrod. Feel free to post charts etc to finetune your, and our trading too =)

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hello Nimrod, Sorry for being silent here. Slight is right, I'm buzzy those days, trading, learning the waves..... Please feel free also to post some of your charts, we can discuss on what you saw on it. You can have a look at the 2 charts I posted here, the 1st one is D1 Cable. I'm looking for an entry short. So, I'm interested to know when this move up will be finished (red dashed arrow). I want to "zoom" in this up move to count the inside waves. According to BW's we have to find a TF where this move occur inside an area of 100-140 bars. We can see that on the 60m. What do you think ? All the best and good trading !

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi star, Honestly, I m a beginner my self and new to chaos trading.I m getting the Bill william book New Trading Dimension by this week on priority shipment and the Chaos Trading 2nd edition.I m eagerly to learn elliot wave theory as you did.Hopefully I ll be able to put some insight as well.I m learning a lot form you guys here and that is a fact. I m sure fxhermit and slight have better understanding on the 5 wave in the Daily chart. I m just guessing based on market sentiment a breakout might take place where Cable might go up heading 1.49 ish this comming days before it rebound to form the 5th elliot wave in your daily chart :nerd:Just my 1cent. what do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Phew! Last week was a beauty, hope you all rang up the pips. A solid countertrend (corrective) wave early in the week followed by a very nice impulse wave that is currently still intact. The beginning of the impulse wave got off to a bit of a volatile start but there were some nice add on trades (1hr, 30 min) along the way. Price has just broken through a support level. Remains to be seen if there will be a re-test and continuation or a full blown corrective wave as price is also beeing supported by the mid channel sloping trendline. Just updated my trendlines.

Hi fxhermit, You bet I will bro.I m still waiting for the book New Trading Dimension.Its still within the custom authority.Hope the D*L guys sort things out by today.I just cant wait.The Alligator is seeing the bears and bulls in the horizon. BTW i m short on the Eur/usd too.Holding my grounds. Keep on posting brother fxhermit.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Well. I guess that I got my answer. The remainder of my last weeks trades were stopped out in profit and I am now flat the market. There was technically an entery on the 1 hr (barely), although I was not around to take it and would probably been hesitant to do so. I now have a wait and see attitude to see where the next set of fractals, etc. form.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
slight, can i ask you something about trading in the zone.? you know when BW says you can buy when The AO and thee AC are green (red) etc , does it then means that we can buy even when the signal is under the red line , or we NEVER buy when we get a signal if the signal is under the teeth , or NEVER sell if the signal is over the teeth.?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Decided to drop down to the 30 min to find a tradable fractal. So far so good. Price is near to the top of the channel - let's see what happens. Gotta love those trendlines.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I like my entry fractals to match the requirement to be above the red line for a long and below for a short. I don't pay attention to the AO color in this case. The AO is really only there to add up after 3 consecutive red/green bars in a trend, or use it to trade waves. Therefore, it is a momentum indicator too, even though you don't use it for waves. However, this derives from the 2nd edition of BW's books. I don't know if you find other information in different books.. fxhermit, you are looking for a short now if it doesn't go above the resistance line we have above the last high on your chart? And long if it breaks .. ?!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Yes, kinda, sorta. I don't want to do to much "predicting" but it certainly makes sense to watch for one or the other around the trendline "heads up" areas. I am quite willing to "Stay calm, be brave and wait for the signs" as per Jasper Friendly Bear's advice. It has proven to be good advice on more than one occassion. What I particularly like about Trading Chaos is that it gives us the signals according to the underlying structure of the market as it unfolds. I have gotten to the point in my trading approach where I see the wisdom in keeping it all rather straight forward. That means less and less attempts at predicting and just letting the signals unfold in the "heads up" areas and taking advantage of them as they happen (particularly those initiating fractals). I guess that it's my way of being in the "traders zone".

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Here are a couple of MT4 talking trend lines. I set them around a price area (fractal) that I might be interested in and then I don't have to constantly monitor the screen. Once the sweet lady talks to me I can come and evaluate the situation. Place the trendlines in the indicators folder as per usual. Place the sound (.wav) files in the sounds folder. Parameters can be adjusted to your liking. I usually have the alert set to trigger 5 pips away from the trendline. Thanks to Accrete for doing the coding.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Here is an indicator that draws horizontal trendlines from the daily, 4hr, 1hr &amp; 15min fractals. The nice thing about it is that it shows the lines from the higher timeframes in the lower timeframes as well. Since fractals are such an integral part of Trading Chaos, this indicator should prove its self to be quite useful. The only criticism that I have is that it can make the charts look rather "busy".

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Here are a couple of charts to show what it looks like.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Alright, I see. I think that is quite a good approach to trading - you go crazy if you always try to predict and see where what could happen when.. so really just waiting for the signs and act upon them. I like it.. Thanks a lot for putting up all the indicators fxhermit, I will definitely try them out once I get the time. Do you only trade eurusd?! If so, would you say it has proven more profitable to concentrate on one pair than on 3-4?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hi Slight, You have a wonderful knack of asking some very simple but ultimately revealing questions. Yes, currently I only trade the EUR. The reason is more one of personal preference rather than technical. I lead a very busy life what with other business interests, travel, family, philanthropy, etc. Trading only one pair makes the market analysis easier and more expedient. One of the side benefits is that after a period of time the charting landscape becomes very familiar giving me, I think, some consistent clarity on where to look for the best trades. I don't know if it proves to be more profitable trading only one pair as I have never done a comparison. However, most USD based crosses tend to be at least some what correlated (or cross correlated) so my reasoning is that I would rather place larger trades on one pair (with proper risk/reward management of course) than spread my money around several pairs. This makes entry and stop loss management so much more simple. With a consistently winning trading methodology, the potential for profit should theoretically still be limitless. As far as predicting goes, you are absolutely correct that it can drive you a bit crazy and I think is a bit akin to being a fortune teller. Unfortunately, many traders fall into the trap of trying to predict the market. I think this kind of goes against William's saying of "want what the market wants" because the market doesn't really know or care one way or the other what one's prediction is. However, that does NOT mean that the methodology being used to try and make the predictions is not worthwhile. Just apply a "Slight" change of outlook. Rather than trying to predict, use the same approach to simply demark "heads up" areas in the landscape and then act upon the signs that appear there. Try that with your wave counting and you may be quite pleasantly surprised at how effective it can be at putting you in the "zone". Just knowing what wave is currently unfolding and what the following wave is likely to be is valuable knowledge. You don't really have to try and predict exactly where the waves will start and end or precisely how they will eventually unfold, that's the job of all the stuff built into the Trading Chaos methodology. As an added bonus, if the wave count happens to be wrong, it won't throw you off into confusion but instead should give new clarity and allow you to accept what the market is doing and carry on accordingly. Much less frustration. I will be so bold as to predict that by doing that you will have great success.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Nice post. This is exactly what I am thinking here right now .. counting waves sometimes puts you in the position that you are too fixed on what has to happen. If it doesn't you get all frustrated. I've had a couple of trades signaling me that it's going to turn and I didn't react upon it causing a loss.. just because I was too fixed on the waves. It is absolutely true and probably the most profitable if one uses the waves as a rough direction-giving map that shows what kind of state the market is in. Still, trading off of the signals presented in Trading Chaos 2nd Edition has to have priority. If I did this in the past 3 months I'd sitting here with a bigger account. Well, you make mistakes and you learn from them. I have been looking at the whole s/r deal too since you've posted it.. I like it a lot and it makes so much sense. It even helped to know, when breaking through a strong s/r point, if a wave is over or another started. So, do you put on trades oriented at higher timeframes, like daily, or rather lower? I figure if on lower TF you have to screen your trades more intensively since trends dont establish themselves over a long period of time.. which means you might easily be stopped out over night or after returning from lunch if you enter off of the 15 mins or 1h chart. Well, this is true only if you are trying to trade the trend. What's your approach to that fxhermit .. rather the long term, checking charts 30mins each day, or do you only trade when you know you have the rest of the day off?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Sloping Trendlines, support/resistance, how I think they relate to Chaos and why I use them. I find that "the underlying but often unseen structure of the market", as Williams calls it, can be revealed more readily with the help of some basic sloping trendlines. Market structure is composed of waves within waves, within waves, within waves.......... In order to begin revealing those waves I start drawing simple sloping trendlines beginning with the longer timeframes (monthly, weekly) and progressively follow them down into the "working" timeframes. My preferences for the working timeframes are the Daily and the 4 Hour while using, when possible, the 1 hour/30 minute to help time entry and for early position management. What do trendlines do? Well, they define support and resistance. Furthermore, from a Chaos point of view, support/resistance define Fractals and, most importantly, Fractals define beginnings and ends of waves. The trendlines help to determine where those Fractals that I am particularly interested in are likely to occur. Why is that? Well, glad you asked.... Wave relationships are governed by the natural laws of Chaos. Consequently, as the waves unfold into the future they tend to swing back and forth between attractors (Fractals). What is so wonderfully uncanny about long term trendlines is that they often delineate those areas of important attraction (support/resistance, Fractals) well into the future. As price once again approaches these areas we have a "heads up" as to where one might expect to find wave beginning and/or ending Fractals. By way of example, I have attached a series of charts (might require a couple of posts to show them all) of how I go about establishing my lines. For the sake of clarity I have removed all of the Chaos indicators from the first set of charts (then I will add them back on for the second set of charts). I always remind myself that the lines only demark areas or zones of s/r and not to expect price to necessarily honour them exactly to the pip (only to be pleasantly surprised at how often that it does). Although I have seen it often, I still find it uncanny how, over and over again, former support will eventually become resistance and vise versa over and over again. The law of attraction is indeed powerfull and so far remains true!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Now for the daily and 4 hour. Those trendlines from way way back hold true well into the future as support becomes resistance, etc.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
O.K. now let's take those same charts and add the Chaos indicators. Now, not only can I can see some of the important Fractals at the beginnings and endings of waves but I can also have more confidence in identifying (and trading) those all important initiating Fractals. I can also see what the Alligator is doing at the trendline areas and even the behaviour of the AO is rather classic.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Here are the daily and the 4 hour. There were a few times near the old trendlines where high probability set ups proved to be very tradeable. This same basic approach can be carried down into the lower timeframes. It's up to the individual trader to decide as to how many more lines on your chart you feel are usefull to the timeframes that you trade within. By adding some of the intra week and intra day trendlines, the charts just become a bit more messy, that's all. I try not to get too carried away and usually just try to define the current channel with an upper, lower and middle line as the fractals fall into place. As you can tell from my previous posts I also like to drop a few horizontal s/r lines on the charts. They serve the same basic purpose as the sloping ones. Every time frame will offer trading opportunities, all in their own good time. Having an awarenes of signals in the longer timeframes often allows me to "drill down" and take advantage of that signal in another timeframe without having to spend too much labourious screen time looking for a trade as I already know what I am looking for. O.K. That is it for my long windedness (at least for now ). Have a good weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Really nice! Thank you again for putting up all this stuff and explaining it. It helps me a bunch. I drew the lines into my eurusd chart to see how it corresponds to my current analysis.. it's awesome how it falls into place with what I do (looking at waves closer than your analysis). What you do with s/r and trendlines is also very simple and intuitive. So it is really easy for me to get it into the chart and just watch how price action behaves at my target zones, at s/r points and trendlines that derive from the weekly/monthly and daily charts. I put up a eurusd daily chart so you can see what I got there. The thicker red lines mark an s/r zone. Partially within this zone, you find my target zone for the current wave calculated by fibos (blue rectangle). Perfectly enough, the trendlines from the weekly and daily chart are all in this area as well. So this is where I will be watching now closely for the reversal of the current downtrend, since the AO and the wavecount on the smaller timeframes tell me this could the zone for a start of a new wave into the other direction.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I like that very much. Slight, what you might like also is to draw thoose parallel channels. It shows also a lot of information. Have a look to the attached chart, I just add one channel, maybe you can add it to yours ? Alll the best

Looks like it has been a month or so since the last postings. Is this thread still alive? I used to visit Forex Factory daily and it has been several months. I had started using BW Chaos several months ago and got side tracked with some other things. I am looking to get back into some BW with an EW twist, which it looks like most are doing here. Anyone still up for discussing the Chaos theory? I own and have read all 3 books. I am currently starting back with book one and going through for a refresher course. Happy Trading and pip taking.

Hi Star, could you explain how does a divergent bar looks likes for a bull and bear when using candlestick?...And how can you tell between an angulation and a parallel line?...When should we counter trend the direction of price action in entering a profitable position?....Thanks......

Btw, just got the link for Bill Williams Trading Chaos 2nd Edition http://rapidshare.com/files/21284178...liams.pdf.html Feel free to download it guys!!!

Hi GatorMan, The link you posted isn't working. Would you mind checking and posting again, please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hello Gator, I'm not using DB for entry, so I'm not a specialist of it.... But if I remember well, it is a bar with the close in the lower part (for an up move). Price as to be far from the alligator and with an opening angle between the blue line and the price direction... To enter in a so called counter trend, you should be able to count the waves. I really advise you to read the book #1. The AO is an excellent indicator for counting the waves ! All the best

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Star, If you are not entering on the DBs, what are you using for entry? Are you trading any of the corrective waves? 2, 4, B? I have read the entire thread and maybe missed it. I am re-reading book one to get a better grasp of the EW and the AO. I will try and set up some charts this weekend and post for insight and learning.

Errrr...hello?...anyone here?...anyone still using the chaos system?...i heard lots of negative comments regarding Bill Williams technique in fx forums. It ain't workin for the current market.I lost quite a sum this week trading using the 3 wiseman. Using daily charts seems not to be working as well. Stick to pivot points and trendlines. Stay with the basics. Anyway, would like to hear if anyone have sucess using Bill Williams strategy. With statement ofcourse. Need some proofs. P.S Is Bill William one of the richest man on Earth? He should be if his tech is totally flawless.....

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hello, in the book #1, the explanation about the AO and how to clearly identify the waves start page 120. (MFI is the AO now). And I'm using the trading plan explained from page 152 to 175. I'm mainly trying to find a point 0, as described in this book and staying in the trade until end of W3. I'm usually out for W4 and try to re-enter when we have a clear situation, for the W5.... The AO gives me an easy and clear counting of the waves, fibonacci gives me entries and targets. I hope this will help you and I'll be happy to discuss more about that later. So, feel free to ask any questions. All the best

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hello, just a personal thought, with no big value, anyone pretending a tech is totally flawless is lying to you. And even if the tech is excellent, the one who apply it is a trader, a human being. So far, I never met anybody flawless.... In this trading world, I am a real beginner and with not much of an experience. So, what can I say ? The only thing that I know is that one should feel at ease with a strategy. This mean that one as to spend enough time to study, practice and understand the tech. One as to persevere and understand from ones own mystakes. BW's strategy might not fit to the mind of some people. This is not a problem because there's many other good strategies ! The problem is that sometime, people are "machine minded" and "package believers", hopping to find an overnight solution to get rich... And, last but not least, there's no statements for that and I cannot provide any proofs for that..... Have a nice week end.

If MFI is the AO now, which one indicates the squat bar in the AO? It is suggested to enter the market at the 3rd bar of the AO depending on the direction of the Alligator. Bill Williams also suggested to counter trend the direction of the alligator instead of following the direction of it. EUR/USD went down against the direction of the Alligator as predicted in the daily charts. I entered the market as the 3rd bar of the AO is revealed.Just made 200 pips for it.....So using William tech is effective for daily charts. But seems to be very weak in using smaller time frames. H4 should be ok i guess. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
The chart below shows a 1hr time frame of EUR/USD. As we can see we have a bullish divergent candlestick but we do not enter position as the AO is still in red. So we wait 3 green AO bars and place a buy order when the 3rd green bar shows up. We put a stop loss just at the low of the bullish divergent candlestick. And also we have an angulation between the alligator and candlestick so should be a strong signal. Any suggestion?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Unfortunately I can`t agree, maybe I understand something wrong: For a bullish DB the AO should still be RED. And no 3 AO bars rule. The 3 AO bars rule is the second Wiseman, which can follow the 1st Wiseman, but is a separate addon signal. So you have on your chart the DB/ wiseman signal which means you have already placed limit order 1 (buy 1 tick above the last long red candle, stopploss 1 tick below same candle) and are about to place limit order 2 ( fractal - sell 1 tick below 2nd last ((green)) candle). If price goes up further, the AO-bars will change colour to green. When you spot the 3rd green AO-bar, this is wiseman 2. Now place a buy limit order 1 tick above the top of the corresponding candle. It took me some time to understand, that the signals are NOT for immediate buy at market, but for placing limits to get just these prices. I hope my understanding is correct. Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #308 ---
So you are saying we should place a buy order one tick above the bullish divergent candlestick despite the AO signal is still red?....AO signal now showing 3 bars green and haven't reach the high og the bullish divergent candlestick. Still its a position good to have a buy pending order right away one tick above the divergent candlestick but its quite risky. Now after showing 3 green AO bars, i have more confident to place a buy pending order at the high of the divergent candlestick. Thanks btw......

I didnt really understand, does this strategy rely on the chaos theory or the name is just a coincidence?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Bill Williams system has nothing to do with chaos theory or chaotic time series.Basically it is just another moving avearge (trend following) system.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Guys , i wanna tel you something , bil wiliams theory really rocks , if yu use it on a large time frame like 1hr or 4 hrs , yu will be laughing al the way to the bank , if it trends in yo direction , just follow the rulkes of exit lie the lips of the aligator as your "trailing stop " and yu wil be teling me a different story.I am laughing guys .Just try it and see

Here are some thoughts according to Trading Chaos 2nd Edition. 1. Divergent bars are considered the 1st wiseman. There are bullish divergent bars and bearish divergent bars which can signal the end of the current trend. Bill uses these bars as the first entry signal understanding that it is a countertrend trade. 2. Requirements for entry with the 1st wiseman (divergent bars): The first requirement is that you actually have a divergent bar, sounds pretty obvious. The second requirement is that you have "angulation" away from the alligator. Bill describes the rules angulation on page 113 of the 2nd edition. Basically you need to have the price of the bars moving away from the alligator's mouth. Thus, creating "angulation" between the two. Concerning the color of the AO: According to the 2nd edition during chapter 8 the color of the AO with a divergent bar is not important. What Bill mentions is that you "expect" a certain color based on a divergent bar. With a bullish divergent bar you "expect a AO bar to be red." With a bearish divergent bar "we expect the AO to be green." This is due to the movement of the current market. Correction based on Forex37 ppt post above: You do need to have the color red or green as appropriate for the divergent bars with the AO. Red with a bullish divergent and green with a bearish divergent. Therefore, I deleted a portion of this post. 3. Entry: Bill explains that with a valid 1st wiseman you will plase a buy or sell order 1 tick above (bullish divergent bar) or 1 tick below (bearish divergent bar) and wait until it is triggered. You will place a stop loss 1 tick below (bullish divergent bar) or 1 tick above (bearish divergent bar) to protect yourself. Now, with forex, 1 tick can be interpreted to what you want it to be. You may consider the spread or other factors you may see. Hope this helps. It is all according to 2nd edition trading techniques.

The whole system in a ppt presentation: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...8&amp;d=1220892084 Although I own the hardcopy of Chaos2, I mostly look into this presentation for the rules of the system. The only missing information in there is the "safety/pink line" stop system (3 sma - fractalsedge version) or 5 SMA offset 3 - which is also not in the book, as it was released later by BW to his newsletter customers only. Two bars/candles closing beyond these means EXIT! Have fun and pips Forex37

hi my friend , what 2SMA s are your refering to wch bill talks about in hie newsletters?i thought the stop loss or rathere the trailing stops should be the green line .ie alligator lips? does he have a new stratergy? or maybe i am missing something?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Read my corrected post! Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I changed my post below to reflect the new information found in the ppt from Forex 37. That post is now correct IAW with the new information passed. Change regarding the color of the AO in ppt versus the 2nd edition book. Bottom line: In the book it simply stated that the color should be "expected" and the power point says the color should be as listed below for the appropriate divergent bar. The ppt is a great reference tool. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Nope, its not a trend follower. Its a counter trend follower. Basically, we buy the lows and sell the high. We do not enter psition according to the direction of the alligator but countering it.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I'm already laughing my way to the bank since using the modified system for over a year..hehehehe...i'm just trying out now the orginal methods of BW and seems to be promising as the modified ones.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
guys , alligator lips are far more reliable than 5 SMAs shift 3 for exits , i know yu might have got this from bill newsletters but i challenge you to check again , on a biger timeframe like 1 hr or 4 hr and tell me what you think.I still use the lips and the other thing ,which has fascinated me is the number of curencies you trade . i used to rade one curency but i now trade 9!!! yes 9 .I used to believe that curencies have a relationship , yes they do but not always , eg gbp/yen and gbp/usd generally move the same irectio but no always , for that reason , i now onlle SELL the weaker curency and only BUY the stronger , its that simple , i am sharing this info coz i got where i am today coz of yu guys on the forum .thanks very much , GATOR , starkozy , etc etc , i only started trading in december and only use bill williams plus Pivots etc .I am loking forward to winning the fxcm micro trading chalenge starting on april 1.Wish me luck

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Yeah, the original is more reliable.No need to change.I'm using pivot points and BW strategy as well. BW works best in 4H and daily charts. I only use 1H if there's a very VERY strong signal (1st and 2nd wiseman agrees together) I'm entering APRIL contest also. I got the Top 10 for January Daily Winnings but too bad FXCM don't reward their clients on daily basis. Hope to get the $25K reward for this APRIL! Btw those who are asking where do i exit my position, well i use fibs to get my profits. I usually take either 50% or %61.8 retracement depending on how deep is the momentum. Then again each trader has their own strategy in exiting. K wish me luck as well!!!

Random Questions: 1. Does divergence count between the AO and the price bars if the AO crosses the zero line? Or does divergence only count if the AO stays on the same side of the zero line without ever crossing? See charts attached for examples. 2. How does trading in the zone apply now? Still using same color AO vs AC? 3. When counting with EW does the AO always have to cross the zero line for a wave 1 to wave 2 or from a wave 3 to a wave 4? Same from Wave 2 to wave 3 and wave 4 to wave 5? I understand the point about the wave 3 within a wave three staying all on the same side until the end of wave 5 inside the wave 3. But what about the wave 3 being complete and going to the actual wave 4 and not the faker wave 4. Not sure if that makes sense or not. See example below. Now I am not sure that my count is correct, just trying to use as an example. The large numbers are the larger wave count and the small roman numerals are the internal wave 3 count. 4. Anyone one using the fractal as the first signal to trade if it is the first signal? Or are you waiting for something else? 5. Anyone using squat bars? If so, off of what? The MFI? Or the AO? If it is off of the AO, how? 6. Anyone calculating the "zone" for the end of wave 5? If so, are you just using the formula straight out of the book? 7. Any other thoughts or suggestions? thanks, RCWSO

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hello, I would answer by a question What kind of information do you want ? As an exemple, in the first chart you posted, the first peak down of the AO is probably a W3, the Xing back above the 0 line gives you the minimum req. for a W4 and then the div. gives you a possible W5. All thoose information given by the AO remain true if you are observing that in a range of 100 to 140 bars. On the other charts you gave us, you can see some div. without Xing the 0 line. The possibility here is that on a smaller TF, you will have the same situation discribed above. Then, the div. is reflecting some inside waves behavior. This I don't know, I'm not using AC anymore... The only time the Xing of 0 line is telling us something is after the peak of W3. It gives us the min req. for a W4.... On others wave it might cross, even several times, or not cross. Now, I'm more using fibo retracements as described in the trading plan, book #1... So I don't know what to say about fractal as first signal... Anyway, if you know where you are in the wave count, a break of a fractal might be a good entry, because it gaves us a breakout. But you have to know where the market is by counting the waves. Regarding the squat bar... I tried to develop an indicator, in order to see the tick volume, the number of ticks in a bar. First I had some technical problem because I couldn't have tick history from my broker (only min, sec. and so on...), so each time I was reloading a chart, the "tick counter" restarted from zero... And secondly, on forex market, the volume you can see is the volume from the hub of liquidity given by your broker and not the "real volume"... So for this 2 reasons, I stopped to explore in the squat bar domain. But one more time, if you know where you are in the wave count, you can "zoom" to see the inside waves and spot quite precisely the end of a trend, find the "point0" and trade the next trend. For this I'm using fibo targets and inside waves, trying to find the W5 of the W5. In an impulse market it is working very well. Even with very short TF. One more time, the most important thing is to know where the market is. The most important thing is to count accurately the waves... And the AO is extremely helpful for that. I hope this is of some help... All the best and I'm happy to discuss about all of this !

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Stars, Yes, that info is of great help. It sounds like you are an EW trader that uses some of Bill Williams indicators to help count. True? A few more questions: 1. Do you use the alligator for anything? If so, how? 2. Do you pyramid your trades by adding on? If so, when and how? 3. Are you still only trading the EUR/USD? 4. Mainly what time frames are you trading? Due to my work schedule and family life I am trying to use mainly Daily and larger. 4 hour once in a while. I don't have time for the 1 hour charts. 5. Are you trading waves inside of waves? In other words, if you enter a W3 on a larger time frame with an order, will you then trade W3 of W3 with a different order? Or would this fall under pyramiding for you vice what Bill Williams does for pyramiding in the 2nd edition by adding on at each new signal. 6. Any chance you can look at the EUR/USD chart I posted and see if that was a valid way to count that particular wave? At least in accordance with the rules etc. I am not sure if we are now in an A, B, C of a larger time or not. Thanks, RCWSO

--- 帖子 #325 ---
In fact, I read all the BW's books and I found that what is said in the 1st book, is really fitting with my mind. Also, I believe that understanding EW and fibo is always useful in every situations because it reflect the very structure of the market. To be even more precise, I believe if you understand EW, any strategy can really work, because waves will help you to filter any false signals given by any indicators. Saying that, the most important is that the strat has to fit your mind. EW fits mine. It might not fit others mind. It is not the panacea, nor the graal Regarding BW's indicators to help count, he presented a method taking the ambiguity out of the EW. You can find that chapt. 7 with examples in the book #1. I'm using that since a while and I should say that it is very accurate. And after some practice, very easy to understand where is the market. If you have any question regarding this topic, I'll be happy to discuss it ! No, not for now... I'm using the MM you can find in the book #1, as explained in the chapter 9. You can find it also in an exellent book written by Robert Balan. It is exactly the same money management. No, I'm looking at all the majors, but I should say that the usual suspects are Cable and Euro, then come the Yen pairs and also the CAD. I'm using any TF, but I like the small ones. Usually I'm trying to find a significant move on an higher TF, then I'm "zooming in", by using smaller TF. Very ofen, I'm monitoring the trade on 10 to 30 seconds TF. As an example, I'm currently monitoring a long CAD on 45 sec. But, I have a friend who is only tradding daylies and 4H TF with BW's system. Another one rarely goes higher than 15min.... Have a look at the trading plan and MM in BW's book #1. That is what I am doing. Regarding the wave count, feel free, if you are interested to read in the book how to use the AO. It is a bit tricky at the beginning to understand how to do... But after sometime it is very clear. If you have any questions regarding this subject, feel free to as k. All the best and enjoy BW's and EW !

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi guys, just to make it simple, So stick to wiseman1 and 2 only and use 4H and daily charts combining pivot points. So far i make no loss in terms of direction of price but i loss some trades due to greed. So money management is the most important of all.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Gatorman, Can you explain how you use pivot points with this system? Stars, I have attached two charts of a count for the EURUSD. One is the weekly and the other a daily. I am attempting to number the larger wave count seen as the roman numerals. The numbers with the "C" next to them are the next count smaller. Can you tell me if I am on the right track with the Roman Numerals or way off base? Thanks for the other answers.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Basically, pivot point has two types.. a SUPPORT pivot and RESISTANCE pivot. So usually i use pivot points as a take profit. Meaning to say if i go short at a particular position, i will exit my position at the SUPPORT pivot. Vice versa for a long position. NEVER enter the market at pivot points cos price might retrace at every pivot points. That's how i use it for my trades. Other traders might use it differently. Be creative......

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hello, Have a look there : http://fetrading.de.vu/ I like his counting !

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Stars, Will do. Thanks. RCWSO

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Stars, How is it that on that website he has W1 near the end of WC? Why is that not the end of WC and the start of W1 going up to where he has his W2? If his count is correct his W2 retraces almost 261% of W1. Wow, I am not sure I have ever read anything about retracements of W2 being that much in any of the EW literature I have. Is that correct? Now if you look at the way I have it counted right now on my chart, not that I am correct, it looks like W2 retraces 50% of W1. It may still go to 61% but that follows more of the rules of EW to have W2 retrace between 50-61% of W1. Is there something I am missing on the inner waves? Just wondering. RCWSO

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi rcwso, the page stars directed you to is mine, so let me explain my thinking behind the eurusd chart. The reason I didn't count as you is, that your wave C is already over, even though it didn't go lower than wave A. This does not follow the Elliott Wave principle, plus you will see in a second that there are a couple of others mistakes in your counts. View the charts and please ask if anything remains unclear. Just as a sidenote, no one knows these waves are counted right, I just take it for a rough orientation which direction the market could unfold to. So I count the waves, but I still only take the signals as entries that Bill Williams provides. Currently we are in a wave 4 on the weekly TF. This wave four consists of a-b-c. Wave A was a 3-wave move, wave B was a 3 wave move too, it corrected almost exactly 61,8% of wave A. Now I am anticipating a 5-wave move wave C downwards. So far we only saw wave 1 and 2 of this wave C. Wave 2 of wave C corrected also almost exactly 61,8% of wave 1 of wave C. Now, this wave 4 of the weekly chart, which this entire thing is, could unfold very differently by just moving sideways or whatever. Altogether, if you look at the monthly chart of this pair you notice, that this wave 4 has not even corrected 50% of wave 3 yet, so there is potential to go lower for sure ..

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Slight, Great explaination. I understand very well now your process and have to say that I agree. I was not looking at the monthly timeframe enough to see the correlation as well as did not understand the Wave C versus Wave A correlation. Can you explain how you now tie your EW count into Chaos with the Alligator, fractals, AO etc? I know that could be a very lengthy answer. I have a feeling that I understand a big picture side of this but any insight would be helpful. My understanding is this: By knowing/understanding the count of the wave, you can then take the signals from Chaos that would go in the direction of the wave/trend. Also, you could have targets to look at with the Fib relationships with regards to EW. So basically, you could look for divergent bars at the end of a wave, look for divergence in the AO and then enter in the direction of the new wave. Also you could use the Alligator and fractal as the first signal in the direction of the new wave if that was hit first or even as an add on trade, if you use that technique. Not sure if that is crystal clear. Do you use the AO for add on with wiseman 2? As an entry signal? Do you add on to your trades in accordance with 2nd edition. Additional question added later: Is there anything preventing you from trading the "pending" 3rd wave of wave C? Potential down fractal from the 30th on the daily that might be triggered within the rules of Chaos. Will have to wait and see if it ends up being a fractal after today. Or are their good reasons to stay away from that wave within the wave C? I know that many people will stay out of wave 4 completely. Although, I understand that the wave 4 is on a larger timeframe and therefore there could be good trades inside that wave. Thoughts? Thanks for the words and help. RCWSO

--- 帖子 #334 ---
You pretty much nailed it exactly how I do it. In order to count the waves you need to start at the highest timeframe, and go further down. You will look first at the wave of the monthly; by switching to the weekly you will look INTO the wave of the monthly. Then you switch to the daily, which allows you to look INTO the wave of the weekly. And you continue this on the appropriate timeframes (100-140 bars) until you arrived where you wanted to go. Never just count waves on e.g. the 15min chart. You don't know which part of another wave this will belong to .. therefore your count will be wrong. As I have said, you pretty much already know how I incorportate what is in Trading Chaos 2nd edition and the waves. Anyway, here it goes again: I will start counting the waves on the monthly and weekly, and then I look at the daily. This is usually the TF that I want to trade anyway, so I don't even bother too much with looking deeper into other timeframes (I only check the appropriate lower timeframe at the start and end of wave to observe if my count unfolds correct or not.) Once I know what the wave count is on the daily, I am looking for a signal .. best signal are huge divergent bars .. those are almost always a dead sure signal for the market to reverse, which means I get in exactly at the very start of the new wave (trend) that is unfolding in the new direction; and hopefully it will be a wave 3, because those are the very best to load up a lot of positions and stay in the trend for the longest time. Once I managed to get in like this (note: if there was no div bar, you just enter on the next valid fractal as you described of the eurusd. This is also exactly what I am looking at: if eurusd closes tonight as it stands now, we will have a fractal below the red line. The wave count says it's a wave 3 of C, so with the trigger of this fractal we want to be short and take advantage of hopefully a correct wave count.) I will trail my stop by 5 bars, and as the trend unfolds I will keep the stop above the last fractal or trail it along the green line. So far I have only added on with fractals and not with the AO. The AO serves purely wave counting purposes for me at this moment. The problem with the AO is a little bit, when you use it to add on, it is so damn early in the trend, that it might be too many positions in a bracketed market .. the trend doesn't unfold and you are sorta screwed with all the positions you have. This is how it's been for me anyway, I am sure if you are more familliar with this particular approach you can sense where it is appropriate to use the AO and where it is not. I am not sure what you mean with "pending" wave 3. Just for clarification: wave 3 is THE wave to trade. It is the most profitable, oftentimes the longest and almost always the steepest wave there is. The only wave you really need to pay attention to, and the best is to stay out of it (except for trading it on a smaller TF), is wave 4 as you already said. All the other waves are perfectly tradable. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hello. Could you please explain me How you count such waves? By using AO or........ I am very intrested.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
would take too long .. go and google "Bill Williams Trading Chaos.pdf" and read pages 104 - 132 .. it's all there

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Slight, Great information. You totally answered my questions. Thanks. I am sure I will have more later as I look at the charts a little more. What I meant by the word "pending" is that it has not actively started as W3 yet. Basically, waiting for the wave to start and it is pending confirmation etc. I didn't mean anything out of the ordinary. Thanks again, RCWSO

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Can anyone throw some insight to the count on the GBPJPY? I am really lost at where we are with the current weekly and daily charts. I know that many times when it is so confusing it seems that you can be in a W4 area. Same thing with the GBPUSD. I am lost. Is it that these pairs are that much more difficult to see in the larger timeframes? I have a very hard time counting the corrective waves. A, B, C within the W2 and W4 times. Any help would be appreciated. RCWSO

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Counting wave 4 is the hardest, since it has the most complex structure, very often you won't know when wave 4 ends until it has ended. It usually doesn't follow the a-b-c principle. Most of the time you get a-b-c-d-e in every combination that you could think of. If you tried to trade it within it's wave, you have to pay attention to 3-wave moves ending in no divergence and shooting directly in the other direction. But acutally, if you want to trade the higher timeframes like the daily for example.. you don't need to count the corrective waves. You would just wait for a clear signal that would incorporate the correct wave count (if you have a chance to check out gold and silver on the daily TF, you will see what I mean. There the internal wave structure of the current wave 4 is also not clear to me, but I would just long for wave 5 above the last significant fractal within this sidemove.) Wave 1 and 2 are oftentimes also only visible for sure when you actually entered for a wave 3 afterwards. So you don't really trade them like you do with a wave 3 or 5, you oftentimes are automatically trading those waves when you follow the BW signals. As for gbpjpy and gbpusd - both pairs have been in wave 4 on the daily for quite some time, this is why it looks so crappy when you try to count it - also, the daily TF is not the correct TF to look at these wavecounts, you would need the 2-day chart to see the entire wave sequence between 100-140 bars. If you switch to this timeframe you see we are in a 4th wave on both pairs. Trying to count on the daily what those wave 4s are doing is quite frustrating and won't lead to much imo... especially on gbpusd it would be quite tough to enter at a good spot for the next leg down (wave 5) .. because you simply dont know where wave 4 will end..

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hello, Yes you are right, end of W4 is quite hard to predict... I'm looking at something for that, the fibo retracements. It gives me a rough idea. Usually, a fractal entry after a retracement of 50 to 61.8% can give you a good entry for the W5. Then, you draw a fibo extension from start of W1 to top of W3, to bottom of W4. 61.8% gives you a possible target for W5. You also have to be careful, because some w5 fails to make a new H/L... When I'll see that live, I'll try to post a chart. This is just a work in progress, I'm not really familiar with it, yet...

Slight and Stars, Thanks for the responses. I am glad that I was at least thinking along the same line that they must be a W4 of some sort for those pairs. Now I know that I am learning something with all of this. I am looking to trade the higher timeframes and really looking to be as patient as I can. That is hard at times. It is very easy to make a chart look like what you want it to look like when in reality it isn't. That can lead to some very bad trades. I have tested that theory a few times in the past. Not very good results. Is there a way to make the MT4 platform go to a different type of time frame like a 2-day or 8 hour chart? Basically manipulate it to give you a different timeframe than the ones they have preprogrammed. I have looked and cannot find a way. So when that is the case, how do you look for the 100-140 bars to count? Seeing that you cannot get it on the correct timeframe and the count is more difficult and doesn't make sense. Question about playing and waiting for the W5 to start: I know it is difficult to predict the end of wave 4, so is there any validity in placing a trade at the down fractal at the end of W3, in this case? Basically, looking for a breakout trade to continue with the 5 wave count down. Although, just thinking out loud here, I do know that sometimes W5 fails to make a new high or low, in this case. Therefore, the trade would never be triggered. And the fact that if it truly was a W5 we could probably notice that a bit earlier on a larger timeframe. Maybe I just answered my own question. Any thoughts? Thanks for the info this week. I look forward to studying more this weekend and seeing how things start playing out for the next while. I will have more questions later. RCSWSO

I know Slight is using MT4. Personally, I'm using Ninja trader. NT allows you to tune your TF to the second very easily, if needed. Also you can use tick charts, range charts... I really love it.... I don't know for D1, or 4H, but on lower TF I saw so many failed W5... And also your proposition will lead to lot of losses... One more time, I don't know for bigger TF.... This wave count works really great if you use fibonacci too. If you have a chance, have a look at that... All the best and have a good week end

hi all, I have not looked at fibs but just let myself ride the trend with no strings attached.. it worked out very well. But stars told me at the beginning of the week how great the fibs work out; and I have to second that: on the bigger timeframes, too, you get reversal signals exactly at the fib extensions or corrections.. it is quite a nice tool to confirm your signal or wavecount. I have to say that I always liked MT4 until I actually started going live with it. It's a program that loads very fast and is pretty reliable with what I am doing, but the easiest things are not featured in this platform, as e.g. switching to an individual timeframe. Ninjatrader is really way more professional in a lot of respects, also when it comes to the TFs. Anyway, I do have a period-converter plugin for MT4. So rcwso, if you are interested in using it, please drop me a mail at slighted123@yahoo.de and I will send it over to you with an explanation of how to use it. rcwso, you say that sometimes the patience is a problem with the higher TFs. I can only second that, BUT I think that there is a crucial thing you need to understand (this is also something that took me a while to grasp). If you use this system from BW you are following the market .. plainly because it's a trend following system. Now, really think about this. You want to FOLLOW the market, and not jump into it, get ahead of it, try to squeeze something out of it. This means, the market is an instance of it's own - it is made up of all the traders and news and whatnot, but still no one can influence it (at least we can't.) So your approach really has to be: trade the dailies (in your case), check out what has happened during the day in the evening, is there a signal? If yes, follow this signal, don't even 2nd-think about it - just follow the market. Get even more intune with following by counting waves and applying fibos. If there is no signal, leave it, don't try to make the market want what you want (GO UP ALREADY). These things will cause tremendous losses especially on the daily timeframe. You need to want what the market wants. And if the market wanted to go down yesterday, but wants to go up today, you will react accordingly. Just follow, and if the market doesnt tell you "hey man follow me" then you don't follow. You only do what the market tells you to do. The holy grail is to want what the market wants, as BW says, and there is a lot of truth in that when trading this system. So, if you reach this point, there really is no impatience, because you would fool yourself if you were impatient, since the market would show you in the same week that you were trying to force the market, which won't work out. It just needs enough times in which you fool yourself until you get so upset, that you will just stop .. and all of a sudden, you understand what you have been doing wrong. It is like getting pissed at yourself, because you tried to make a zillion dollars from one day to the next. The market acts as your guide telling you when you fooled yourself and when not. Having a mindset like that has trippled my losing account within 4 weeks.. it happens right then, not at some point of time in the future.. you will feel it if you don't put any pressure on you and the market. If you enter for a wave 5 at the top of wave 3 you are too late ... but don't worry about this kind of stuff. Generally, try to get yourself in tune with the markets and you will see that this kind of problem doesn't even occur.. it all falls in place before you could have this problem. It sounds kind of weird, but that is what the market is: not a mechanical phenomenon that you study and you will turn out the best of the class (as in college). But the winner will be the one that is able to get in touch .. It is really quite hard to find words for that, and I am sure you are now thinking "this guy is retyping what BW said in his book." .. but this is exactly what the market is. I could elaborate on that for much more, but this is something you have to reach yourself to know what is meant by it. Actually, here is how I got to come closer to this perspective: if you trade only the large timeframes, it will take weeks (and too much money) until you know you are wrong/right, and then it takes even another couple of weeks until you know if what you thought was the mistake really had been the mistake... so my suggestion is: when you are on holiday from work, take yourself 3 days off - 3 days from 8am - 6pm without anyone bothering you, pick yourself a pair or something else in the mornings that looks good, and follow it's waves.. count the waves and see how they unfold INTRADAY. You will feel how you are in touch with the markets when the waves unfold in front of you. This means, at the end of the day you will know if you are totally on the wrong track or if you are right. Within the next couple of days you can fine-tune your thinking... and since the market is holographic, what worked on the 5min chart will also definitely work on the daily TF. And once you reached the point where your wave count, your entries and your exits are profitable, you can start trading on the daily TFs.... This is how I got to look at the markets as I do now. I am not the most profitable guy in the world, hahah, but it sure enough got me closer to making a profit in the market than ever before. I hope this makes some sense..

Slight and Stars, thanks again. Great words all around. I am at the point where I need to read and re-read a few things, to include BW stuff on trading mindsets. He explains the various stages of trading very well and I cannot say what stage I am in exactly but know that I need to make sure my mind is in the right place as I move on. I am sure I will have several more questions after the weekend. Thanks and I look forward to the following weeks of learning. RCWSO

A couple of questions: 1. During a sideways market, typically W4, will you play each signal in the direction expecting W5 to start? Example: If W4 is has a an overall uptrend but you really don't know when it may end and there is a divergent bar along the way will you trade that DB not knowing if that is the end of W4 or not? Or will you wait for another signal like divergence from the AO or for it to hit a specific Fib line ratio like the 38 or 61 lines? I am just wondering if it is worth playing all of those trades knowing very well you may lose out on a few but you don't really know when it will truly end. I do understand that you can look for the A/B/C corrective wave patterns so will that also drive your decision to wait for the C wave to even start placing trades on DBs? In other words, not trade the A or B DBs that may form and wait only for C wave DBs. Hopefully that all makes sense. 2. I understand that everyone has their own money managment techniques. Stars, you said you use the money management from book 1. How does anyone else do their money managemnt? Does anyone use the actual pryamid trading managment from book 3? 3. Stop loss: I know that there are many ideas here as well. 5 bars back, red line, green line, blue line, previous fractal etc. Any insight or better information that anyone can share? How do you move them along as the trade goes in your direction and when do you tighten them up? 3b. If you do add on to your trades using some sort of pyramid set up with money, where do you put your new stop loss for each new trade? With the other stop loss from the original trade or somewhere different? How does this play into your money management? 4. Stop and reverse: I understand the concept but does anyone use this technique to have a stop and reverse in? Or when would you use them versus not use them? Here are a few more questions I would like to add talking specifically about EW counts: A few basic type of questions for my own knowledge. 1. When in a wave 2 or wave 4 of any degree will they always be an A, B, C correction? Or can it still be a standard 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 count for that wave 2 or wave 4. Or does it really matter? 2. When a wave A, B, or C or any degree happens will they contain 5 waves all the time or can it be 3 waves as described in the EW book? So A and B are a 1, 2, 3 and then C a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. 3. Kind of the same question as number 1 from above, is wave B always going to be labeled with a A, B, C correction of the next smaller degree or can it be a standard 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? 4. Any other insight on this or does it really matter? I have the hardest time with the corrective waves. I just wonder if it is worth worrying about the count for the corrective if I don't really want to trade some of those anyway. Although, if it does have a standard count of wave 1-5, then I still would like to trade the impulse waves of the correction, ie wave 3 etc. 5. Does Wave 3 have to be at the highest AO every time? Or can it be smaller than wave 1 at times? If so, what would determine that? Lots more to learn. Thanks for the help. RCWSO

No. You take only the breakout fractals. There will be a lot of fractals created in the a sidemove that have no major significance whatsoever. It's usually the fractals that mark the upper and lower resistance that are important. I would only take the DB if it is very clear and the inner wavecounts look finished. The pyramiding works out pretty good if you catch the trend right from the start. I wouldn't advice using it in the beginning though. I don't follow any specific MM rules. Since this system is not a black box system the way to enter, use stops and exit is different in each trade. There is no overall "this is how to do it" if you ask me. Maybe someone else has a good universal method?! Usually when I do it I secure my first entry by moving the stop to BE at least. If there is a better location for it, then I put it there. The stop of the new position will be where the moved stop of the 1st position is. While this is also nothing to be looked at universally .. kind of depends what it all looks like. Of course. This is used very often at the turnarounds of waves. But since you can never be sure if your count is right, you have always a stop and reverse order in. Because obviously, if the wave didn't unfold as you expected, then it's either a sidemove happening which will go nowhere, or the trend unfolds in the other direction. It is actually very important to always have this order in the other direction in. Maybe the following chart will help you to answer those questions yourself. Make sure you really understand it, then your questions should be more or less resolved.

I agree with Slight. And here's the bear version of his chart. I printed both and nailled both on the wall in front of me.

Thanks for the answers. Those charts will help a lot. I have read the EW book by Prechter a couple of times and I believe those charts are in there. I didn't even think of printing them out for easier reference. I will study and watch those for a while. More questions to follow. Thanks, RCWSO

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Wanted to revive this thread and talk about stops. Anybody have opinions. I usually use a trailing 2-3 bar and/or profit target based on fib. I have used the green line and the purple line in the past but feel like the peak to stop drawdown is too much for me. I'd rather get out and jump back in. Keeping the profits is the hardest thing about this system. Multiple contract entries make it so. Whats everyones max entry limit. I have been using 3 entries but may move down to 2. I am also thinking about stepping into the 4 hour charts(used to be an end of day only trader). Whats everyones "best timeframe" for wiseman trading? Anything else you want to discuss about wiseman, ewaves, or specific ideas...bring it on! Anyway, just trying to keep this thread going!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
hey greenriver, good to see this thread alive again. I also mainly trade the dailies. And yes, the stops are huge, but of course the profits are as well. When I entered on a div bar I trail the stop by 5 bars. If I get kicked out I just enter on the next valid signal (usually a fractal.) During the trend I keep the stop below the last fractal, but I am watching the green line of the Alligator as well and exit my position if price closes below this line. Intraday I do this differently. I never use the 5 bar trailing but just move the stop to the fractals... while this also depends on the situation. Exit is at the green line ... and I only trade 5 or 15 mins. I remember you saying you attended the tutorial?! I would have a question about it if you dont mind... what do they teach as a stop in a trend? I noticed that using the green line often gets you out too early... while the red line, in some cases (towards the end of a trend) is not a good deal to exit the position, because price usually closes far below it. Any suggestions? Oh, and another thing real quick.. do you know anything about incorporating Elliott Waves and the methodology from TC2 from the tutorial? Thanks a lot in advance, Slight

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I am also still around. I read on FF almost everyday and trade Chaos daily on different timeframes. I look forward to more input from others on techniques and ideas. One that I believe was mentioned here was to get out when it hit the Red line vice the green line. This allows you to stay in a trade and not get out at the green line. You may lose some profits on some trades when it pulls back beyond the green line but it may also keep you in more trades. Anyone trading smaller timeframes like 5 min or 15 min? It seems to me on those timeframes it is a lot more fractal type trades vice BDBs. Any thoughts or ideas?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Ha! Good to see you guys are still around. Slight , I like your method of trailing up a stop behind the div bar and of using the last fractal in the trend. Its just so hard to have a big profit and watch it all go away in one day. How do you deal with that aspect? When I first started trading wiseman I would just use a 2-3 bar trailing and take profits if a div bar if it occurred, just like in the book(TC2). If the trend started up again I would just hop on the next fractal. I made 200%+ the first 6 weeks. Then I had to learn more about it! Home study etc….. I am beginning to think that the way as taught in the book may have the most consistent profits. Maybe not the best returns, but week in and week out the profits will come in. I think it has a lot to do with personality. Some can really let it ride and others need to keep taking the small gains. Your question about red vs green line, it is my view that for the beginning of the trend use the red line and the end use green line like you say. A simple way to remind yourself to switch to the green line is to use a parabolic stop. When it starts getting close to the market you know the trend is getting long in the tooth and its probably a good time to switch to the green line. Or as I have done in the past, just use a parabolic and be done with it. As far as waves, they don’t teach a lot about them in the tutorial anymore. I go back and forth about it. I have seen more wave patterns change before my eyes than I care to count. It makes it hard to be completely unbiased about the market if you are counting waves. I think the best thing to do is to look for the conditions as described in book 2 (NTD) starting on page 189. Sleeping alligator, AO at zero, AC at zero. I then look for Div bars and fractals. Those are by far the best trades for me. Once I am in a trade then I will use waves to project a profit target. That would be 1.618 or 2.618 extension of waves 0-1-2 in a wave 3 and .618 or 1 extension of waves 1-3-4 in a wave 5. I will most definitely have a tight stop at the higher projection, maybe even a limit order waiting in the market. Also, I don’t try and call the top or bottom with a div bar anymore. I wait for the first pullback in the new trend and try to catch a div bar there. It ends up having you trade 3’s and c’s which are the more powerful trends. Rcwso, I have tried 5m and 15m and seem to end up break even always! I have better luck at 1H and up. How many positions will you guys add in a trend? My max is 3 total. Good to hear from you!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I'm still around too. As Robert Miner says counting waves is not that important. The waves are mostly important for the pattern and what it says about trend or countertrend. What you want to know from the waves is your position relative to the market. Trend waves are 5s. Countertrends (corrections) are 3s. The Chaos system is a trend trading system. You want to be in trend waves. The number of the wave really doesn't matter. You don't want to be trading the corrections, because as Bill Williams says that's where most of the profits from the previous trend get given back. Williams says that the alligator will tell you all of the above. If the market is wallowing around the alligator, it's in a corrective wave, trend waves pop out in the direction of the prevailing trend. My understanding of his teaching on stops is that initially fractal stops are trailed below the red line, as the trend progresses or if the trend move becomes too energetic the stops go behind the green line. I prefer to use fib and price projections to determine the target and just stay until it gets hit or start moving the stop closer as I see the target approaching. Williams does in fact still use Elliott Wave to make his trading decisions. He just doesn't trade the waves as such and says so in an interview in Stock and Commodities in 2008. He also does not use fibonacci, although I follow Miner here and make extensive use of fib projections for price and time. You can find the article on his website at profitunity .com. Nice to see the thread alive again.

How many pairs are most of you following with this system? Any that you stay away from? Any other good lessons learned that you all have had recently? Look forward to learning more as this keeps going.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Thanks for the insights guys. I will see how I can manage the whole redline/greenline stop thing. What you said, greenriver, definitely makes sense. Personally, I have come to the same conclusion in my trading, that the waves have to be handled just as taxgeek explained. Paying too much attention, or getting obsessed trading a certain wave, usually leads to losses. Seems everybody agrees to trade the methodology as of TC2 and have a rough wave orientation. I dont use fibs or trendlines or s/r .. just following along. Works the very best for me. Rcwso, maybe I told you this before, I am watching 12 pairs, 3 commodities and 3 indices. Which ones do I pick? I am just looking for trend-characteristics on the monthly and weekly charts to not end up trading neverending sidemoves from the monthly on the dailies. Lessons learned? Dont analyze in the normal sense, dont interpret - just follow the signals as in TC2 along.. even if you lose, you will stay with the flow. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Greenriver, what's a parabolic stop? Could you elaborate a little more on how to use it, or how do you spot when its better to now use the green instead of the red line as a stop? I usually like to let it run and dont take small profits, except for there was a div bar and I felt price could turn around (pretty seldomly, often in wave 4). My experience so far has been, that I dont get kicked out keeping the stop below the last fractal. In most trends it works out very well. I have in the past exited as soon as the green line was hit at the close of the bar, so I didnt lose too much of my profits (original fractal stop never hit.)

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Sight, Parabolic stop is an indicator available in most platforms. I use Advanced Get and Tradestation and its available in those. Its whats called a Stop and Reverse indicator(always in the market) but I use it as just a stop to get out. It starts out at the last pivot point and trails the market up or down. It starts to tighten exponentially as the market moves in a direction. If the market starts to trend really hard it will tighten faster. Its the dotted line in the chart if I can figure out how to post it!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
TaxGeek, Miner's book is the best. Well worth the money. Have you looked at his recent work? He seems overdependent on oscillators these days. Do you have any thoughts about that?Thanks.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thanks a bunch, I'll try it out.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I haven't read his newer book. Giving some thought to getting it. A lot of what he does is a promo for his software, but most of it is doable with a good old fashioned spreadsheet and some extra work. I just use the regular fib tool for price projections (adding in his levels). The TCRs whether retracements, alternate time projections, or trend vibrations, I just figure the days and calculate with a spreadsheet. When you get both together it really works. He does seem to be stuck on oscillators, particulary the DTOSC, which is, of course proprietary. He does claim though that he doesn't use these in the normal way. How he uses them is, of course, something you only find out in his courses or maybe in his latest book. (Possibly they fulfill much the same function as Williams indicators.) I've haven't quite gotten to the point of being willing to buy those, but his methods do work well to compliment the the dbar (better than the rather subjective angulation). That's really all I'm looking for out of them. I just want to know that I'm trading the Wiseman and not a Dumbman.

Metatrader has it as Parabolic SAR.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I post this for comment. Who see's angulation and who does not and why. I have drawn lines to the last cross of the green line to todays close on the green line and the red line. How do you draw your angulation lines? Each of the prior Div bars have failed to produce a reaction, will this be the one? Please note that this is the CAD futures... not the cross. I guess the CAD/$ would be the same. Lets start the discussion... there is no right or wrong,that I am sure of!!! Edit: I have added a more orthodox drawing of the angulation lines in the second chart. Which ones do you prefer. I know this is in the book but many use different beginning and ending locations so I am interested to hear others veiws.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
hi greenriver, I have put the arrows in your chart as I would have drawn the angulation (red arrows); hence I see angulation... The way I draw the lines is: where did the price move - where did the "middle of the blue and the red line of the alligator move." Most of the time the lines I draw do not cross. The reason I do not like this divergent bar is the AO. It is at its peak and the trend could continue further up in what could be wave 3?! When I try to take divergent bars it's mostly those with divergence in the AO. But I guess this is to everyone's own liking... I do not care too much about the angualtion.. I pay more attention to what the AO tells me divergencewise.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
How is everyone handling the no-hedging rules with their brokers? With my broker I can no longer have a stop and reverse type trade or cannot bracket a ranging market waiting for the next breakout.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
by the way rcwso. I was short and long at the same time on gbpjpy yesterday and nothing happened... guess that's due to the broker?! idk

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Must be the broker. My broker sent out an email that said a way to combat this problem was to open two accounts. The catch is that you have to put money into both and margin rules apply to both. So, it looks like another way for them to possibly make some more money on people that go in too big or don't pay attention enough. Are you day-trading today?

Hi, I am studying Dynamic Trading Strategy (Robert C. Miner), and I learned Max Trading Strategy (Jim Pruit, just past away). Both strategy are swing and break out (on swing) trading. What I learned from both, they don't use fix setting on the oscillator. you can combine any indies (Macd, Stoch, RSI, etc.), as long you can see the "REVERSAL". Well, I found DTOSC is still the best to indicate OB-OS reversal. But Stochastic is also good. So, Miner said, the name of indicator and the setting are not the big issue. 1. Using Dual Time Frame (TF), Use Higher TF for Trend and entry using lower (or more lower). the point using lower TF for entry is finding the smaller stop loss below the previous swing low for buy entry. So, The Entry is also the main the issue, but Stop loss. 2. Name the "Probable" pattern in higher TF. It doesn't matter if it is 5 waves, ABCDE waves, or (min) ABC wave/correction + Fib Note. Base on those information we should find the *probable* trend and resistance. Miner said, the Elliot Wave doesn't have to be perfect Wave, and we don't need too deep in E-Wave. 3. Use shorter setting for Higher TF, where you use for trend analysis, and Use longer setting for Lower TF. This is the important point (my own opinion - the book says nothing). We use longer setting in lower TF to see if the entry is still in trend or not (specially when use fractal as entry) 4. I add GMMA series in higher TF to filter the trend, specially when it on 5th wave and make ABC correction. Exit ---- (for Buy), shift the (profit) Stop-loss on below the low bar where the price reach the important fib-note, specially when the oscillator is in OB or Bearish Reversal. Well, that what i learn from those 2 swinger trader. I think we can use it on DiNapoli Strategy too, since the author don't teach clear entry strategy in his book. Let's share more strategy.

kissaki, So how does that apply to Chaos trading? How can it be incorporated to improve Chaos with Bill Williams? Thanks, RCWSO

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Your best ones will be with the AO strong though. Only way to be any way close to sure is shoot a couple of fib projections off the previous major wave and the last minor wave. The fibs determine the fractals. If they cluster, you've got your wiseman. Even then you may get a stop run that goes above the wiseman. No way to be 100% sure in Forex.

Hi Everyone I just ordered 2 Chaos books - highly recommended by a fellow trader. I went through the forum postings since 2007. My heartfelt thanks for your sharing. Will the system work well for options/futures trading? I am also planning to trade USD/CAD in the very near future though I will need to learn more. Will count on your support/guidance once I start reading the books. Thank you in advance. Have a nice Fri/relaxing weekend.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Good start. The Williams certainly trade commodities and stocks with it. Bill mostly trades commodity ETFs with it at presence. So I would think it would work for options as well, but I have no experience with this area. Definitely will work with USDCAD.

Your prompt response has confirmed that I am "finally" on the right track. Thank you. Have been trading stocks/options since 2006 and paid advisory vendors for stock/option picks. Lost over $100K as they do not have an exit strategy. Stocks/Options fell from $ to pennies and they still asked the customers (incl me) to hold on. I was stupid not having any IL orders to minimize the loss and/or protect my gains .. sigh .. Finally this year I decided to be my own financial advisor and find my own trades once I am competent to do so I must add. Completed some training programs on options and futures and can't wait to do consistent successful trades soooon! I've become a "full-time" trader (to be polished) after getting married and relocated to a small city. Am glad to learn about the Chaos books and it's a nice surprise to locate this Chaos forum where users are willing to share and guide the new learners like me. It's very hard to have no one to turn to. I am thrilled that I am not alone in this new venture. Thank you .. Thank you. I just went through the Alligator System Set-up - I forgot to write down the name of the Forum member - Thank you. Will visit another link capturing the system overview this weekend. Can't wait to read the books and apply the learned knowledge to locate Successful trades. Have a Great weekend everyone.

Hopefully some of you caught the nice up move on this pair. Started out with a wiseman (at the appropriate fibonacci fractal area, good angulation too, if you don't mind that kind of subjectivity). SAO came along about the right time to get smacked by wave 2, which is why I don't use it. I look for support at the end of that wave 2 before adding. After that really nice fractal add ons. Only question now is how far it goes before a larger wave 2 knocks it down again. To answer that question you will see that I have drawn in several sets of fibs. The light blue ones are a fib expansion of minor wave 1 (of either wave A or 1. I don't care which.) The purple set is an alternate price projection from minor wave 1. The red set is a retracement price projection of minor wave 2. The purple, green, and light blue ones repeating in the background are absolute fibonacci lines and represent the true fractal development of price movement. Bill Williams fractals are nothing but price patterns. They don't mean much. If you look at the chart, there are a lot of them on this chart, but there are only 3 real fractal patterns. Good for about 3000 pips. If you go to the Silent Service Thread and follow their method of drawing s&amp;r lines on the monthly and weekly charts, you will wind up with a similar pattern within a few pips. This too will help you see the real fractals. It looks a bit messy, but the idea is to build a spider web for price to move in. I'll add another retracement price projection when the minor wave 4 completes that will even more exactly pinpoint the end of the minor wave 5 and the point to take profit. I basically do the same to pinpoint entries. Once we see a wave 2 or B form (I won't trade it.), we may be able to tell if this is an abc or a new trend. This is pretty much how I've combined Chaos with a couple of other things to make it more accurate. I tend to stick to the daily bars. Shorter term charts don't allow the kind of analysis that I've done here at least not comfortably.

My trillion thanks for your Prompt Advice. I will do my best to create a template capturing the indicators. May need help again though. Have a Successful Trading week ahead.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Actually the indicators and template are built into Metatrader. Just look for Williams in the Template list. There are some indicators on there that aren't used in the newest method, but you can just delete them.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Everyone Appreciate very much your quick advice to my raised issues. While waiting for the Trading Chaos (2nd Ed) and Trading New Dimensions books to reach me, I have started reading the first book today. Thanks donfriday for the link to the pdf version. Just finished Level 1: Novice Trader. Am enjoying the knowledge learned and BW has made it very easy for newbies (incl me) to understand. Smile. You will definitely hear from me again with more questions. Thank you. Have a Nice evening/Great week.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I have a "big head" after going through the Elliott wave chapter twice .. Located Awesome Oscillator and MFI from a demo website. Still trying to find the remaining indicators .. Feel like a "dummy" .. Let's hope my head will clear a little after reading the confusing chapters again and again.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
mt4 template willl give u what u want just go to indicator and click bill williams u will find it all but MFI is not useful as much..i dont use it either.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Yes I downloaded MT4. Cannot access the indicators as I do not have a user account. No freebies out there and I still need to find a way around it .. Have not been generated $$ for some months now and rather spent a lot on the trading programs + another $2K loss on a trade recommended by the mentor. He's very stubborn to ask us to hold on and most of us did (80% loss). I hope soon I will be competent to find consistent successful trades using the Chaos system. Sorry that I am reluctant to spend $$ before making any. Good news: I finished reading the first Chaos books last night. After reading the Elliott Wave chapter for 3 times, I am not as confused .. haha .. Plan to go through the suggested indicators/strategies again while searching for a "complimentary" or "reasonably priced" solution for the system set-up. Grateful for the advice/guidance provided in the forum.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
MT4 comes with free data and is mostly free from brokers........so just complete your registration....then viola you are on.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
wgreenie, If you downloaded it through your broker or a broker you simply need to open a demo account or live account. Depending on if you want to trade live or not. Sounds like you want a demo account. Then as mentioned, you just complete that registration and you should have access to all the bells and whistles of MT4. Once you are at that point you just need to go to the top of the screen and click on: Insert Indicators Bill Williams and now add the appropriate indicators. You will have the alligator, AO etc available. Some people add a BDB indicator that can be found here on the FF. It is up to you. Enjoy. RCWSO

--- 帖子 #389 ---
[quote=wgreenie;2842494]Yes I downloaded MT4. Cannot access the indicators as I do not have a user account. No freebies out there and I still need to find a way around it .. If you're looking for the indicators described in the first book, these won't be part of the template. TWR has been replaced by the Alligator. MFI has been replaced by the Awesome Oscillator, which fulfills the same function and more. MFI is available in Metatrader but does not work properly with Forex volume. Awesome Oscillator does not have this shortcoming. As traded by Bill Williams currently the system has only two entries 1. a bullish or bearish divergent bar or 2 a fractal breakout above the red line of the Alligator. It's extremely simple. These trades especially the BDB are taken with very small positions. Add ons trades are accomplished using three Awesome Oscillator bars of the appropriate color following the BDB (W1) or adding at each fractal breakout whether current or historical. Stops are placed at the base of the W1 or behind the Alligator's red line and as the trend progresses moved up behind the green line of the Alligator. If it gets way beyond the green line, you can move it up to the bottom of the previous bar. That's about all there is to it as he currently trades it. In other words, don't worry about saucer trades, twin peaks and such. You need to know the history of the system to fully understand it, but the book two system will cause you to lose, if you trade it. It probably worked when markets moved in long slow trends. They don't do that anymore.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks gentlemen for your prompt response (as always). I feel better now and will explore the suggested ways for a "free" set-up solution .. haha .. No wonder the forum is talking about the revised indicators found at the second book I guess. Good to read the first one as foundation and I can't wait to read the second &amp; third ones (will reach me next week and I just got a delivery notice). I will have better sleep now that I know you will help me in my learning path! You make it "sound" so easy .. haha .. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Oh, I checked w my broker. Its platform does not support BW system. My best bet will be: try to open a demo account (with live or delayed data I hope on the market) or open a TradeStation account. Funny that I left a message w a TradeStation rep Mon morning and he has not returned my call yet .. Hmm .. Back to be a smart bookworm now .. smile .. Enjoy a Successful Wed.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
hmm if you contact profitunity to u want the system with esignal they will send to you but not for free...if u can afford trade station go for it ...i prefare the free mt4 as i dont have much to spend on trading platform.. if u open fxpro .com or ibfx u will get a good data feed from them ibfx is the best of all..

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I will of course try the "free" channel(s) first. Will I get free data (even not live) on stocks and ES Futures (S&amp;P emini) or just forex? My peers mentioned TradeStation many many times. I only consider it now because of the BW set-up. I don't like the idea of paying a monthly fee of $100 (and $50 more on live data) .. You all are experts in trading and newbie me needs guidance so that I can shorten my search/chase. I am extremely grateful that there're forums out there with experienced traders/users (like you) who are willing to share and answer any questions I may have. I really hope that I will soon be posting sample trades to reconfirm my understanding on the Chaos system. My trillion thanks again. I do not feel "alone" anymore on this new venture .. haha

--- 帖子 #394 ---
esignal and trade station will cost u and as a beginer u should try free chart first...i think u should contact profitunity group they will give your more guidine ....esignal data feed is awesome i use it before ....fxpro have more intrument and good sever to give u fast update ... just call profitunity first or download fxpro mt4 and williams template. demo and u will find what u want.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yes, I will do my best to locate a free platform so that I can test out the Chaos system without paying a dime .. smile .. I prefer a simple solution like a turnkey one .. haha .. so that I will focus on learning the system and practise what I learn. Will start reading the Trading New Dimensions book in a few minutes. Enjoy your afternoon + a relaxing evening.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
You can pretty much use the chaos system with any broker. They don't have to have all the indicators. Awesome Oscillator is a 5-34-5 MACD. That's all. They probably have the MACD. Alligator can be replaced with plain moving averages. Not exact, but you just want it to show you the trend and the red line location for fractal buys or sells. Try 13, 25,38 smas. Those come out fairly close to the shifted and smoothed mas of the alligator. The smoothing is the problem anyway. He uses CQG and the other programs don't use the same smoothing methods, which is why profitunity provides indicators for other platforms, but I think you have to sign up for the home study course to get them. That's probably the only way that you get indicators exactly like his. As far as fractals go, just eyeball them. The Alligator in Metatrader probably is not exactly accurate. I doubt Metatrader uses the same smoothing as CQG. All you're doing is drawing a line in the sand at the red line and trading fractal breakouts above or below it. No matter how he makes it sound, it's not rocket science. You could stick the Ichimoku clouds on your chart along with the MACD and trade fractal breakouts and above and below the clouds and accomplish the same thing. Don't get hung up on charting and indicators.

Hi, Just get a demo from www.fxcm.com or any other one you prefer. When you are ready....say so on this board.......then someone probably me will send you all the BW indicators......how about that?

Hello my Chaos Mentors! I will explore the alternatives you mentioned and hopefully will soon report some good news .. Wish me luck! Hey, I started reading the Trading New Dimensions, the pdf file I found in the forum. Seemed all graphs were missing after reading up to page 30sh. Is there another file somewhere?? If not, it's okay because my books should reach me next week (incl the 2nd edition). The stock market drops so much so far this morning. I have not done any real trades. Not many trade ideas from the daily chatroom for the past 2 weeks - that's where and how I find my trades. With your help/guidance (even you trade mostly forex), I am confident that I will soon learn how to find good trades (stock/option/futures too). When I talked with my father-in-law last night, he asked me if I may soon learn how to trade forex. I told him that's plan, ie CAD/US$ as a start. My heartfelt thanks again Gentlemen (I think my guess is right). Your prompt response has made my day (as always). Enjoy a Relaxing Long weekend (if you live in the States) .. almost Fri for the ones who are not .. smile ..

Believe your day has been going well .. ditto here. I got the Trading Chaos 2nd Ed book minutes ago. Plus I browsed one of the suggested websites fxcom.com I believe and just opened a demo account with GCI. Have added the BW indicators to the S&amp;P index (one of the symbols listed in the Market Watch section). Hurrah! I will check my notes before adding some entry/exit points to the graph for your confirming my understanding. Hmm, maybe I should wait until I finish reading the 2nd Ed book. I am too "anxious" to start and do trades even paper ones .. haha .. Oh, questions please .. How can I add more symbols, eg some stocks, so that I can apply the Chaos system to find good trades? How can one use the Chaos system to scan trades and not limit to one's stock list?? I do not have the answers and can only count on you to help me .. sorry .. Thank you .. Thank you. Enjoy a Great afternoon.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I agree with you wholeheartedly that one MUST trade with good MM. I started trading stocks and then options in 2006 ... no exit strategy .. no stop loss concept and simply waited to be told when to close the trades (mostly from the paid advisors or my friend - they all do not have an exit strategy - gosh!). Some winning trades became losing ones (some 100% write-off) ... most of the hard-earned $$ down the drains. I still have some 2010 call options - all are penny ones now (I bought some at 2-digit $) .. sigh .. My heart bleeds everytime when I look at them .. It's almost another $10K write-off if I close them now though I doubt it very much if I may get more for holding them longer .. Time decay may kick in very soon .. That's why I must learn how to trade and find good ones myself. Learn to fish and not begging for fishes ... Oh, I am a vegetarian .. smile .. Well, I am very positive that my future trades will help regaining all lost ground + I will soon be on a Successful track ... Yes, I will be a diligent bookworm and start reading the second Chaos book in minutes. Take care! Thank you again.

i have same call as urs....2010 will be great i hate 2009...how you got the book? pdf format or notebook u have with you?

Please help my understanding on the enclosed chart. 1. Fractals - Up and Down Arrows i) Up Arrow = buy fractal ii) Down Arrow = sell fractal iii) Up Fractal 9 not valid because it's below the Alligator's teeth iv) Down Fractal 14 not valid because it's above the Alligator's teeth v) Down Fractal 2 over-rode Up Fractal 1 vi) Down Fractals 3 and 4 could be signals to add-on more though sell orders were not executed because the price did not fall low enough to hit the orders vii) All sell orders cancelled with Up Fractal 5 viii) Buy order (triggered by Up Fractal 5) cancelled with Down Fractal 6 In short, no buy or sell orders were executed because the Up and Down fractals have been cancelling each other and/or the price did not hit the order price before it's cancelling out. That's my prelim understanding on the fractals. I believe I need to incorporate the AO, AC and Gator signals at the same time. Thanks in advance for pointing out the missing pieces.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
what this all about...u funny remove that gator and use 15 or 1hr tf 1min chart is to small u will get fake entry.. just take your time dont push too hard..u need more time to read the 2nd edition....i what i use the fractal for is 1-2-3 HL....

I got the first Trading Chaos book (pdf) from the forum. The 2nd Ed one is a hardcopy which I ordered on-line. Will start reading it very soon. The 3rd book (New Trading Dimensions) is another hardcopy and will reach me next week. Yes, 2010 calls are better than 2009 ones. I wrote off some 1/2Q 2009 ones earlier .. Now I am very cautious in buying 2-digit $ options and stocks. I just signed up for a webinar on Ninja Charting which will start in 25 mins. Bye for now.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I finished reading the 2nd Ed book + I found out how to locate most of the US stocks in the GCI MT4 platform using the demo account. Hurrah! From the 2nd Ed book, I do not recall reading the AC (Acceleration/Deceleration Oscillator)?! Will it be replaced by the Second Wiseman (add-on signal) - either 3 "red" decreasing AO bars or 3 "green" increasing AO bars? To validate the Second Wiseman, do the red bars have to be above the "0" line and the green ones below the "0" line? Or it does not matter if they are above or below the "0" line as long as the red ones are decreasing and the green ones are increasing. Please help clarifying the above. Thank you very much. Oh, last question: Should I focus on the 3 Wisemen signals (Bullish/Bearish Divergence Bars, AO and Fractals) on the 2nd Ed book and not including the ones in the 1st Ed? I am a little confused. Will read my notes again on the two books before practising the newly learned skills on some sample charts. Have a Wonderful weekend Everyone!

--- 帖子 #408 ---
He does not use the AC in the new version. He still says all the signals work. I just don't think those work quite as well. The AO appears to be used only for the second wiseman signal. If you read the first book and remember that the AO and the MACD (or Elliott Wave Oscillator actually) are in fact pretty much the same, you will also recognize it's value for determining where you are in the waves and verifying a potential count, which can keep you out of poor trades by just following the fractal signals. The second wiseman is not a replacement for the AC but a whole new signal. The only requirement for the second wiseman is three bars of the same color. It doesn't matter if it crosses zero, but it might be actually a better signal if it did. I would focus on the latest system with reinforcement (as I pointed out above for the AO) from the first volume. He's doing the same thing, just with different indicators and less emphasis on wave counting. The principles enumerated and explained there will help you understand how to find quality signals with the newer methods. He refers to the first book in the second, but he does not really explain some key concepts there. That material is in the first.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Your response has made my weekend. Thank you! I will focus on the 3 Wisemen signals on the 2nd Edition book per your kind suggestion. Am going to re-read my notes and summarize my understanding .. Hope you and others will continue coaching me in my learning process. My Big Big Thank You! Hey, I am thinking of adding US$/C$ forex in my paper trades. Plan to attend a free forex webinar first as I have no idea on how to do forex trades. I know again that I can count on all of you (seasoned forex traders) in this venture. Smile .. Take care and have a Great Successful week ahead.

Hi Everyone I finished reading my notes several times and would appreciate your confirming my understanding as follows: 1. Wiseman 1 - Bullish or Bearish Divergence Bar (D/B) a. it's a counter-trend signal b. it maybe the first entry (though I learned that Wiseman 2 (AO - 3 consecutive bars of the same color) and Wiseman 3 (Up or Down Fractal) can be an entry signal on its own) c. MUST be outside the alligator d. Angulation MUST be present, ie price is moving away from the Blue Line e. AO MUST be Red with a Bullish D/B or AO MUST be Green with a Bearish D/B Note: When the Bullish D/B becomes a Down/Sell Fractal, have to stop and reverse. Same for the Bearish D/B. Question: How can I add a B/D/B indicator to the Chart please? 2. Wiseman 2 - AO a. add-on mostly after B/D/B and/or Fractal b. better entry signal if they cross the "0" line Question: Must the 3 Red AO bars be decreasing for Sell and the 3 Green AO bars be increasing for a Buy? 3. Wiseman 3 - Up or Down Fractal a. Must be above or below the Red line b. Could be a stand-alone entry 4. Buy or Sell Stop: 1 Tick Above or Below the price bar in question Question: How can I find out more on 1 Tick in $ term? 4. Timeline for Chart Analysis a. 10-min for volatile markets like the indices b. 30-min for currencies c. Do not trade on less than a 5-min chart Note: I will also look at the hourly, daily, weekly and monthly charts. I am almost ready to paper trade my Mentors!! Smile. Appreciate your comments and guidance please on the above. My trillion thanks again. Have a Nice evening/Great week.

You can use a current fractal on the proper side of the red line as an entry. Wiseman 2 is an add on entry only. c. MUST be outside the alligator d.

Thanks taxgeek and Forex37 for your prompt guidance! You have made my day "again" .. haha .. I have amended my notes accordingly + visited the suggested "Tick" link. I will practise the Wiseman signals on a sample chart and post it sooooon. Will count on you to coach me again then. Thank you in advance. Take care and Enjoy a Great day.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Good afternoon Today is a downday and I have been practising the Wiseman signals (esp the B/D/B and Fractals) on the ES Futures market. What a shock when I noticed I'd placed the entry the other way round, ie sold 1 tick above the top of the fractal bar when I should be selling 1 tick below. Glad that I was paper trading .. The following questions arose and appreciate your guidance please: 1. Bullish D/B and Bearish D/B I will only focus on Bearish D/B and disregard all Bullish D/B since they're all below the red line. Right? Note: No buy when it's below the alligator. No sell when it's above the alligator. Regarding angulation, I am not 100% sure on how to draw the price line properly. Would be great if you have a chart handy to illustrate how to draw it. Thank You! 2. Alligator Set-up (13-25-38 SMAs): Please correct me if I got the blue and green lines wrong. 38 SMA for the blue Line (Jaw) 25 SMA for the red line (teeth) 13 SMA for the green line (lips) 3. Wiseman 3 Signal - Up and Down Fractals Again, I need to observe the following: - Only buy when the Up Fractal is above the red line - Only sell when the Down Fractal is below the red line 4. Can I trade based on Wiseman 3 Signals (Up/Down Fractal) alone + making sure the entry is above or below the red line? I can cross-reference the S&amp;P 500 index (using the alligator system) with the 3 SMAs. Will it work? Appreciate your guidance again. Thank you. Continue enjoying a Great day!

Hi to everyone ! I'm a chaos trader too, glad to see there's a chaos thread

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Sorry .. Correction on my earlier post: Can buy with a bullish D/B when it's below the red line .. It's a counter-trend signal! The bars are below the red line. Same for the bearish D/B even it's above the red line and we can sell. Am I right this time? However, I need the respective AO bar to confirm the signal before entering the market. Please confirm. My Big Big Thank You.

I am forex trader i also trade chaos and have my own thread..i think u have the book right so u dont have the problem....divergence base on time frame u are using but mosthly 1hr divergence is for intraday and daily ow weekly can be a swing position if the price action show a strong reversal.. that is all i know so far ..

--- 帖子 #419 ---
something like this is a perfect BDB......u will find many more base on the pair u are trading .

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Here's my first question: it's bad use chaos system on 15M timeframe?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
it's not bad but i focus on 1hr alot becuase i found good setup in it ...u will find good BDB and anagulation on those side.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Believe the BDB buy order was filled when the subsequent price bar hit 1 tick above. What happened when the Bullish D/B became a Down Fractal shortly? 1. Still hold on to the Long position and 2. Place a new Sell order triggered by the Down Fractal signal (though it would not be filled) OR 3. Disregard the Down Fractal as it's not aligned with the earlier Bullish D/B signal? Please confirm my understanding. Thanks. BTW: Do I have the 3 SMAs right (38 for blue/jaw and 13 for green/lips)? I want to make sure that I do. Thank you! Have a Nice evening. (I do not do any real trades today as I would like to focus on practising the Chaos indicators and possibly this week. Funny that the indicators I learned from the Futures program sometimes conflicted w the Chaos ones, ie it's a Buy when Chaos is a Sell .. What would you suggest? Stay with one of them or try to have a combo?)

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Mmmhh I was thinking about entry using fractal but I read different rule for a VALID fractal... The buy/sell fractal is valid when is above/below alligator's teeth (red line) The buy/sell fractal is valid when THE PRICE TRIGGER IT above/below alligator's teeth The buy/sell fractal is valid when is above/below and OUT of alligator's mouth (so above alligator's jaw / below alligator's lips ) I got a bit confused, what's the right condition for a valid signal? here some images of the above examples: (I post links because I prefer keep screenshoots with full size ) http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/7956/eurusdj.jpg http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/290/eurusd2.jpg http://img39.imageshack.us/i/eurusd3.jpg/ I don't want to be too much "accurate" but... when I can consider a fractal above/below or outh of alligator's mouth? I've to look for the whole candle/bar or just at high/low of it? Also... If I've to entry with breakout fractal, I can consider right enter the last valid fractal on the chart ignoring the following false fractal? I'm sorry if I disturb you with ten thousand questions but I hate don't be sure of something.... especially in Forex Thank you for your help mates

Hi Everyone I've started practising the 3 Wiseman signals on some paper trades this week (while waiting for the third book New Trading Dimensions). 5-min chart very busy/crowded and 15-min one quite quiet (not very accurate). I plan to do 5-min and 15-min ones on the past 6 months and see if I may find a clue on how to use the signals more effectively/successfully. I would also like to explore how to do Forex trades. I watched 3 intro webinars last night. 2 on the market (players and how the market operates) and 1 mostly a sales pitch on their services. I do not get a better understanding on Forex yet. To shorten my learning path, appreciate any advice you will suggest. For example, do I need to have a big investment pool to pursue the Forex venture? My broker charges the customers minimum $2.5 for a forex trade (1 way). Which are the easy pairs to start with? Thank you for your guidance again. Enjoy a Relaxing weekend.

hmm i might help u on my thread okay....u need sometime and patience this system is simple. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=175762

--- 帖子 #427 ---
The key on fractals is where the fractal is taken. Buy fractals should be above the red line when taken. Sell fractals below the red line when taken. It doesn't matter where the fractal forms. For an initial buy or sell, it should be a current fractal (meaning I assume the last one formed, I've not seen the term defined). For an add-on fractal, you can use pretty much any fractal current or historical. How close to the mouth is determined by how aggressive you want to be but waiting too long can result in losses.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Good evening everyone Need your guidance please. There're 3 Up fractals on the enclosed (I labelled them 1-3). Would you trade them with a Red AO when the buy orders were triggered? All 3 were profitable trades though. Please clarify and this will save me getting into trouble. Thank you. Have a Nice evening.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
they were breakout fractal they are know longer valid as price have angulate away from them and form a new wise man wan at the top to if u where long u should look at the bigger tf or u exit that trade in my opinion. there is one AO green and the bar was a wise man 1 so it might be a retrace or change of trend u can only be sure in a bigger tf if price have not hit the target,.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I do paper trades on the Chaos indicators and not real trades. Thanks for pointing out the Wiseman 1 signal (where the last Up fractal located) and the green AO bar has validated it. I used another system to get in some real trades today .. Am breeding and have decided to hold them overnite hoping that the S&amp;P Index will drop tonight or tomorrow .. Wish me luck else all my Jul trades' profit will be used to sponsor today's trading mistake .. sigh .. Thanks again for your guidance and have a Nice evening.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
July was a learning month for me. I learned a few "big" lessons. Now I will always have a bracket order attached to my Futures order so that the system will either close my position when my profit objective is met or the stop loss order is triggered. No more big surprises that will wipe me out! Came back from a Vegas/Phoenix trip last Sun (finally met my in-laws for the first time). Have started paper trading using the Alligator set-up. So far mostly winning ones except a few when I missed the signal and tried to have it worked "belated". Another lesson for me - if I missed it, let it go and wait for another signal. Also joined a daytrading chatroom and plan to stay until end Aug. I realize I prefer daytrading as all trades will be closed by the end of the day. No troubled nights .. haha .. My trillion thanks again for all your support/guidance. I will be back with an update in Sep. Take care and Successful trading!

Many people are using profitunity and metastock I guess. There is an expert advisor chart in metastock (v. 10.1). Does anybody know; How can we use profitunity expert advisor chart which exists in metastock (I have version 10.1)? There are commentery preview notes in it but they ara not very clear. What should we do especially when there is blue bar? Thank you in advance for the replies.

Hi Everyone With your guidance in Jun/Jul, I am more capable of practising the learned Chaos indicators in trading YM (Mini Dow Futures) for the past 2 months. Have been paper-trading them (esp the Up/Down fractals and taking note of the reversal divergence bars) with a few more indicators and am happy with the results. In short, my confidence level has increased substantially and will start doing more real trades in the coming week. My heartfelt thanks again for making this venture a smooth and successful one. Happy &amp; Successful Trading!

Hello there ! I've been away from this thread for a while ! Sorry about that... I'll try to post some charts again here ! To re-start, here's a chart, D1 Cable. Let me know what do you think !

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Another chart, for the euro, just as a reminder. This is a D1 chart.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Welcome back, What has your success rate been so far using this method and are you using the new indicators. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hey ! I'm principally using what BW is explaining in his 1st book to know where the market is and where it will likely go. Then I'm using range bar charts to smooth the price action and enter mainly on fractal break. Then, I'm monitoring the trade on a small range bar chart and close the trade when candle close above/below the red alligator line. This is a nice conservative method, providing 2 to 3 trades a day...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thank you for your response. If I understand correctly, you are using a higher timeframe for entry and a lower timeframe to monitor the trades. What time frames have you found work best.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I'm using Time based charts for the Elliott waves and Fibonacci analysis. For trading, I'm using Range Bar charts. You can use any range, it depends how you feel comfortable with the speed of the market. Bigger range will filter more, less signals, less trades, longer runs... More relax. Then if you go to smaller range, you have to think more about scalping. Anyway, it works on any size, because, as you probably know, BW's strategy is based on the very structure of the market. So, any market, any size. The only thing I do is to choose my ranges as a Fibonacci number, just to keep some coherence....

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hello, Here's a nice chart showing how to spot the waves, according to Bill Williams method. I think my reading is right. Please any comment is welcome !

Hello, Here's an update of the cable situation. The divergence continued, I think she is ready to start the wave 4 down. But there's a bunch of news today.....

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I just grabbed some and trade is now protected. I marked a chart with some levels of concern I'll keep an eye on...

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Interesting situation.... I still believe that there's a possibility of Wave 3.... Now we have a double top, so I don't know if it will pierce north or what.... What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Nice charts. How long have you traded with Chaos? And do you generally use 45 minute time frames?

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hey ! I'm using chaos since about 2 years now. I'm using Time based charts for the Elliott waves and Fibonacci analysis. As described in his book #1. This one is 45min, because the move fit inside 100 to 140 bars in the past. So, info on the AO are right. For trading, I'm using Range Bar charts. It is smoothing greatly the signals. Also, I'm mainly using fractal breaks. All the best

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Do you use BDB's very much?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Honestly, on Forex, I haven't seen much divergent bars working out... It seems that DB are working a little bit better if you use range bars and do a good studies of Elliott waves and Fibonacci levels... I would qualify this signal as quite aggressive entry.... Personally, I don't use it as an entry, but as a sign of some possible reversal. Usually, the next signal is a 2nd wise man or a fractal. Then, you should also starting to see some divergence on AO... Some odds are piling up and help you to validate an entry. All the best

--- 帖子 #487 ---
That's cool........I can dig that.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Saying that, I had an after thought.... I'm testing some things on fast charts, like 8 range or 4 range... And it seems that DB are more reliable... You might have a look at that. Tell me what do you think.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I can't resist to post this follow up about the cable behavior. She really did as forecast... If you apply correctly Bill Williams technique, you can be really surprised how much market can be predictable ! This one is a "By the Book" and you can compare with the previous charts posted. Isn't she pretty ?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I tend to think that the bdbs don't work out, because the system is designed for stocks and commodities (especially commodities or commodity etfs). Yes the books show examples of forex charts, but Bill Williams admits that he has never traded Forex. For that reason the system can't just be used literally but must be adapted. For instance 1 tick is not the equivalent of 1 pip. I, also think that there are problems with his concept of angularity in Forex. It just doesn't seem as clear cut on the charts. The only way to know if a bdb is for real is to do the fib projections and find a level at which the bdb can be expected. Then you have some kind of chance of trading it successfully. Far more bdbs are produced by Forex than other markets and more of them are meaningless. People who don't use the fib projections should probably use the same techniques that the James 16 group applies to pin bars to determine when one of these is tradable. You also have to be aware that bdb on your broker's charts may not be a bdb on anyone else's. In order to see an identical chart to everyone else, you have to trade the 1 hr or lower charts.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I totally agree with that ! And Fibo projection will really help to filter bad signals. But, as I said in a previous post, on range bar charts, mainly fast ones, like 8 range or 4 range, DB looks way better than on time based charts... Yep ! that is so true ! But, the Elliott wave and Fibonacci part, BW is explaining remain perfect for any market ! As quoted in book #1, you will find a very nice development of this technique in " Elliott Wave Principle applied to the Foreign Exchange Markets" By Robert Balan. A must read !! Thank you for your comment !

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Really pretty!! Perfect 5 waves with diversion. BTW, I do not know what 4 range or 8 range is....could you clarify please?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hello, As you know, on a time based chart, every x minutes, a new candle appear. On a range based chart each time the price cover a range of x pips, a new bar appear. I like it very much because it kind of smooth the price action. I guess you are trading with MT4 ? If yes, as far as I know, they do not provide the range bar option. I have attached a 21 range chart, just to show you how it looks...

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Very cool thanks. A perfect BDB on a 5th wave. I use GFT with trading forex. Approximately what time frame would that 21 range chart compare to?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hummm.. You cannot really compare to a time frame... If the market is slow, it can takes hour for the price to move a range of 21 pips and if suddenly there is some action.... You see what I mean... Just to have a look you might want to try NinjaTrader, free platform with free datas for demo. All the best

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thanks......I appreciate it.

For range bar charts, there is script for MT4. I've attached one below. There's also another one around that can be purchased from mqlservice.com. Don't ask me how to use. I've never tried it, but it looks interesting. The best way though is probably to just download ninjatrader.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Oh ! I didn't know that ! Anyway, I'm not using MT4, but I think this will be useful for others ! Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
EURUSD is interesting. There's quite some odds for the beginning of a Wave 4, with a possible move down to the 61.8% Fibonacci level. Let me know what do you think !

--- 帖子 #501 ---
It does look like it has topped on a Wave 5. I would look at this on a daily that it could be a beginning of a Wave 1 down. The low so far does touch a longer term trendline. It could retrace over the next couple of days to form a new daily fractal. If you look at an 8hr chart you can see the potential first wave down. If it does form this fractal and it breaks below it could become a wave 3 on an 8hr chart. Why do you think this is only a Wave 4? Are you basing it off a monthly chart?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
You are right, this ls probably a wave 1. But an "internal " wave 1, a wave 1 of the wave a, 1st move of the wave 4. The wave 5 "topped" you are talking about is the wave 5 of the wave 3. This chart is a daily chart btw. 14440 min is D1. Sorry if my explanation is not clear.... All the best ! And happy to discuss with all of you.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
With some other pair, I would tend to think we were beginning a correction of wave 5, but the EURUSD likes to run to the 262 rather than the 162 fibo. That confuses things. I'm not sure which it is. The end of wave 3 or the end of wave 5, but I do think it's ultimately heading down for a correction of some degree. For the Chaos system it really doesn't matter. Just want what the market wants!

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Yep, I agree, market is the MC ! Just have to follow it.... But if we have a wave 5, where was the wave 4 ? Can you post a chart please ? I'm not sure to catch your logic.... Thank you very much for your post, it is very interesting.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Looking at the daily the wave 4 of this moved happened a year ago. Remember the highest point on the AO is always a wave 3. We are have been in this wave 5 since March. But on a weekly chart I can agree with your assessment too. If this is in fact a true Wave 5, it will go to at least 1.6038. Waves are always subjective anyway as only time will tell huh?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
This is true if the move fit between 100 to 140 bars in the past. Remember that the information delivered by the AO are correct only under this condition. Another point is : the minimum requirement for a W4 is a crossing of the 0 line on the AO, after a the High produced by the W3, inside the 100-140 area. I adjusted the time frame in order to fit the last move inside the 100-140 area. Now, we are sure that AO is telling the truth. We have the high, corresponding to the W3, then we have all the extension of the W3, producing a lot of divergence. And we will have the minimum requirement for the W4 when the AO will cross below the zero line. As long as AO is not crossing, we still are in W3 and a continuation up is possible. But price came back below 161.8% Fibonacci extension level... Another interesting thing is that the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level is matching with the top of the Wave 1... Rules seems respected. All comments are really appreciated !

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi, Does ninja trader have Bill Williams indicators built in to it (Alligator, AO, fractal)? I didn't see it on their charting details page....just curious. Thanks

--- 帖子 #508 ---
In most cases a wave will progress to the 162 fib projection before a correction begins in the opposite direction. EURUSD in fact went to the 162 projection off wave 2 twice and then fell back and turned to continue upward again to the 262 fib projection. It now appears ready to turn at the 262 fib projection. In most cases wave 3 will progress to the 162 and stop, but in the EURUSD waves often seem to be longer and go to the 262 of wave 2. Under normal terms we would I think be looking at the end of a 5, but it probably is a 3 ending and 4 beginning. Upshot is it's headed south, we'll find out which wave exactly when we see how far down. Incidentally I'm in and in profit.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Yep ! If I remember well you can find them here under the indicators section. I hope this is helpful and feel free to ask any questions.

I know that I am coming to this thread kind of late, and it has sort of died out, but I am hoping to revive it. I have Bill Williams' second and third books (New Trading Dimensions and Trading Chaos 2nd Ed.), but I have never read his first one. I am very familiar with his later trading styles, including fractals, the alligator, AO, AC, BL, W1, W2, etc. I was not aware, until reading this thread, that he had also developed a fairly objective way to identify the Elliott wave structure using the AO. This is reallly attractive to me. I have Prechter's book, and I find Elliott Wave Theory fascinating, but it has always felt WAY too subjective to be usable....And way too complicated. That's what I found so fascinating about this thread with respect to Williams' first book Trading Chaos (which I have ordered, and it is on its way to me). Using the AO to be able to identify the correct Elliott wave in real time is really, really cool. And, once you get the hang of it, probably really, really effective to trade with. I have been trying to wrap my head around how to count the waves, and I have attached a chart with my take on the current count. Unfortunately, as I am at work (don't tell my boss), I don't have access to my metatrader so, instead of using AO with all of the other Williams indicators, I only have a blank chart with the Elliott Wave Oscillator. The EWO and AO are almost exactly the same, so the analysis should be the same, too. Here we go with the analysis... The chart is the USD/JPY H4 chart. I have 154 bars on the screen so, according to Williams, the wave count should be correct. I located the highest peak on the EWO, and called the corresponding price peak the high of Wave 3. I looked back to find Waves 1 &amp; 2, in order to confirm that. The immediately preceding low point in the EWO I called the 0 point. As the price moved up, there was a retracement to a 50% level. That roughly corresponding to a minor low in the EWO. That looks like the 2 point. Moving forward from the 3 point, price retraced and the EWO crossed the 0 line, so that is the minimum requirement for Wave 4. It also reached a 50% retracement of the Wave 1 to Wave 3 distance. Price then begins the Wave 5 advance towards the 3 point, while the EWO makes a lower peak. This divergence between the EWO &amp; price is the normally expected (and required) behavior for Wave 5. In order to be Wave 5, it should exceed the high point of Wave 3. Williams says that Wave 5 should normally be 62%-100% of the distance of wave 1 - 3. From the beginning of Wave 1 to the height of Wave 3 was 597 pips. 62% of that is 370 pips. Adding that to the low point of Wave 4 (87.36) gives us the lower edge of a the potential zone where Wave 5 should end: 91.06. Adding 100% of the move to wave 4 gives the upper edge of the potential reversal zone: 93.43. Update: As I have been preparing this chart, price has already broken the #3 point, confirming that this is Wave 5. So far, it has peaked at 90.90, only 16 pips from the beginning of the potential reversal zones. I welcome any and all comments and/or feedback. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I decided to drill down to the H1 and M15 in order to find out where we currently are in the H4 Wave 5. On the attached H1 chart, you can see that the wave count looks a little jacked up. Again, I identified the highest high or lowest low of the EWO and called that the peak of Wave 3. In confirmation of the number 3 point, right after that peak in price, the EWO crossed the 0 line, which is the minimum for Wave 4. The only problem with Wave 4 is that it retreats so much that it actually overlaps W1. According to classic Elliott Wave Theory, W4 should never overlap W1. Williams points out, however, that rule is the one most frequently violated. Perhaps I have points 1 &amp; 2 labeled wrong. Perhaps point 2 is really the 0 point, and a lower time frame would show the 1 &amp; 2 points. It doesn't really matter, in the long run, though... Price moved beyond the 3 point, while the EWO diverged and made a lower peak. This is W5 behavior, so W3 &amp; W4 are correct. It doesn't really matter about W1 or W2. I have also attached a M15 chart, to show the internal wave structure of the H1 W5. As W5 is an impulse wave, it should have a 5 wave internal structure on a lower timeframe. On the M15 chart, It is easy to see that we are currently in W3. In the end, that means that we are in W3 of W5. As a result, price should continue to move up, for the M15 still needs a W4 retracement and a W5 extension to complete W5. Final analysis: we could put a pending buy limit order around the 50% retracement level of the M15 W3, in order to catch W5. We should be looking to set a TP level somewhere in the profit zone of 91.06-93.43. Moreover, for those people using Williams' methods, We should be looking for a Bearish Divergent Bar somewhere in that zone, as the H4 W5 comes to an end. As always, any comments or feedback is appreciated.

Hehe !!! Welcome in the EZ Elliot wave counting !!! Yes I agree with you this is just fascinating and so good !!! I'm using that everyday and it really really really help !!! Have a look at the website in my signature, I'm posting charts everyday... Have a good week end !

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Continuing along with my trying to learn how to count the waves using the AO (or EWO), I have posted two GBPUSD charts. The first chart is the H4. W3 was easy to locate (highest or lowest peak in the last 150 bars). Verification of W3 came from working backwards and identifying 0, W1, &amp; W2. W2 retraced beyond 78.6% of W1. That is very unsual. As verification of W2, you can see the a,b,c three wave correction in W2. Looking forward from W3, we can see that, once again, W4 actually retraces into W1 territory. W4 is confirmed by the EWO crossing the 0 line. So, right now, H4 is in W5, as it has surpassed W3. The next chart is the M15, to show the internal waves of the H4 W5, to see where we are. Labeling the 1 &amp; 2 points of the wave are a little difficult. It is not really clear where they are. The nice thing is, though, by using the EWO, we can tell that the 3 point really is 3 and not 5. We can tell this because, if the four points of the wave down really were 1,2,3,4,5, then the EWO would have retraced and crossed the 0 line for the W4, as well as formed a divergence from price at the end of W5. As EWO hasn't retraced and crossed the zero line, nor has it diverged from price, this actionary wave is still in play. The bottom peak can be no higher than W3. The current retracement on M15 can be no higher than W4. That's the REALLY cool part about using AO or EWO to verify the wave count -- it is incredibly objective. Ultimately, We should expect price to turn down and make another press below the 3 point, before the downward move is over. The target zone can be estimated, but I haven't done the calculations. As always, any comments or feedback is appreciated.

This is the kind of stuff that I do with EW and BW. I like to look at the internal EW structure to see if I am correct in my thinking about the count in the higher time frames. The internal waves should prove that the larger waves contain the right stuff. Here is my take on the EUR/USD which has done a 1, 2, 3 (or an A, B, C) and is now working its way up through a possible wave 4 zig zag. I usually avoid wave 4 trades but thought I would try to catch a 38% pull-back with this one. The b wave will probably still go a bit lower but here is the count for now. I have marked the 1.38 and 1.62 time ratios that BW uses to catch the end of a wave 4. They come in on Jan 1 and Jan 8th. If it gets above the fractal at a I will add another order and sell just below the 38% level if it all works out. I have a new green bar on the AO and two green bars on the AC as I post this so maybe the c wave has started. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...minDec2809.jpg

--- 帖子 #516 ---
That looks like a fair take. Picked up 131 pips on 2 lots on the EUR/AUS yesterday and on the overnight market. I have the charts up in our live trading room at the link below.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Do you have any particular method of prospecting for potential trades? I am trying to get myself into a routine that will start finding the trades to take rather than focusing on a chart and waiting for fractals to form.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Here are two views of Elliott Wave counts for the GBPUSD. Both are daily counts; the first is longer term and the second is zoomed in for detail and Fibonacci ratios. Long term GBPUSD daily chart Dec 30 09. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...%20Dec3009.jpg And here is the detail inside the last wave structure: http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...9%20detail.jpg Now all we need is a fractal above the Alligator's tongue. (Sorry, I forgot to add the Alligator to the chart.) At this point, the first fractal is at x. 1.6411 I will update the chart if another fractal forms below x. From x to the 1.62 Fib ratio is 1393 pips. Wouldn't that be nice? Time projection is Jan 25th. Any comments, strategy, entry tactics below the x fractal, etc appreciated.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Looking at a weekly chart this also could be the beginning of a Wave 5 down. It also could fit the fundamental consensus of a weak GBP based off economic conditions. But either way of course its just "wanting what the market wants" that wins out. Thanks for you commentary and feel free to post your charts at the site in my signature. You would make a nice addition to the Chaos Trading Room!

--- 帖子 #520 ---
If you go to the site in my signature and join the Chaos Trading Room you'll see potential trades and trades that are in progress. I personally use 2 hr time frames and sometimes do shorter term 15 min time frame trades. Chaos Trading uses BDB's to enter trades along with fractals. I use candlestick interpretations to enter trades at times as well. But also as Dr. Bill Williams says, "We as traders get paid to wait for the proper set up".

--- 帖子 #521 ---
In addition to AvidTrader's site, I have started a blog where I am going to be recording my daily analysis and trades on 11 different currency pairs. I won't be using the Elliott Wave analysis, though. I find that too time consuming. Even Williams himself has stopped that. I will be using the trading signals from New Trading Dimensions (his second book) and Trading Chaos 2nd ed. (his third book). I have also started a trade journal, here on FF, where I am posting the same charts so that others can discuss them if they choose. The link to the blog is in my signature. Here is the link to my trade journal on FF: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=213496

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Where did you get that Williams doesn't wave count? Waves are counted through using the AO. He's not so interested in the actual wave number itself, as counting can be subjective, but he certainly is looking for diversion from the AO. He came up with the AO himself.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Dude, relax. I have read all of Williams' books. The second and third books I have read more than three times apiece. While he does talk about and show how to count the waves using the AO in the very first book, there is absolutely no mention of counting waves in books 2 &amp; 3. Book 1 was written in 1997, I believe. That was over 12 years ago. His later books even say that his method is for those who want to trade the Elliott Wave without having to count.

I think this system is quite good and especially because of fractals. The entries after fractals break make this system valueable. Also I like alligator because it shows quite good the trend direction. What concerns AO and AC I think they are unnecessary.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
lol.......I am relaxed dude. Its just that I know how the man trades. First I read his books. Bought all his home study courses. The one from 1997, the updated one in 2007, went to his private tutorial in 2008 and was invited to his home for one on one training a couple of times. So I kind of know what he is looking at when he trades. As I mentioned above he looks for diversion when using the AO.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hello, I believe in book #2 and #3 he is very briefly talking about the waves counting, mainly referring that the ones wanting to know more about it should have a look at book #1, where it is very well described. And, in book #1 he is also quoting another very brilliant guy, Mr Balan... Did you read his book ? That is a very good one about wave counting. Also, the Elliot Wave Principle is way older than 1997, the trader who understand it a little bit will see why it will work as long as markets will be traded by human beings.... Bill Williams in 1997 (Book #1) just presented a method to remove all ambiguity in wave counting... I'm using this method everyday and, believe me it is working perfectly. One will probably also have a look at Fibonacci levels, it works together. All the best and happy new year !

AUDUSD, nice double top, a lot of divergence on the AO. I think we will start a wave 4 soon. But lot of news today !!!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
A longer time frame... A nice double bottom and divergence on the AO.....

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Here's an update on the AUDUSD. When AO will cross below the Zero line we will have confirmation of W4....

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Interesting situation .... Let's see how it develop.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hey Wab ! Thank you for posting your charts ! I'll follow with interest ! It will be interesting to see if our two different methodology give the same result. Here's an update for AUDJPY, the crossing of Zero line on the AO gives us some clues for a wave 4.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Similar situation here...

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Thanks for your update on chaos system. Can you please advise if the AO cross 0 line is that indicate wave changing ? How do you predict end of wave 2 ? since really want to catch wave 3. If you found a signal like BDB on 3500 min chart, do you directly trade on the same chart or you go to lower time frame ? Hope to get your help. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #542 ---
When AO is crossing Zero line, it does not necessarily indicate a wave changing. The only thing, related to waves, the crossing indicate is "after a higher high on the AO (wave3) when AO is crossing the zero line, we have the minimum requirement for a wave 4" This is valid if the move we are observing is inside a 100-140 bars area.... The end of a wave 2 can be "predicted" when we have a sharp move after a double bottom/top then a Fibonacci retracement of 38.2%. This should be the start of a wave 3.... I'm trading from shorter TF, I'm using the longer Time Frames for drawing my trading map..... I hope this help ! Check the link in my signature, tons of info related to this topic.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hello again, Pipfirst, here's a chart to illustrate what I was saying... I hope it helps !

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi Starskovsky, yes, I already walking around to your website. Really a tons of EW counting. Thanks for your answer and sample of chart. By the way, I still a bit confuse regarding end of wave 2. inside wave 2 there is 3 sub wave. so its always a double top/bottom on the price and the AO not crossing 0 line right ? Thanks n Regards,

--- 帖子 #545 ---
You can have a small internal 5 waves in a wave 2 or and A,B,C move that seems to end on a wave 3.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
1st, I'm looking for the end of a wave 5, end of the previous cycle. Very often we have a clear 2ble bottom/top. 2nd, we usually have a sharp move in the opposite direction. then price retrace to the 38%-50% fibonacci level (wave2). 3rd, I'm looking for a signal to enter in the direction of the sharp move we previously saw, then, you should be riding a wave 3.... I hope this help. You can find all of this in details in BWs' book #1.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
The euro finally pierced the support.... Check the chart.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Let's zoom in the last down move. We are now at the 100% Fibonacci extension, the usual target for a wave 3. If it stay there, it will likely start to retrace up for a wave 4. If it continues down and pierce the 100%, we will have an extended wave 3.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Thanks for your explaination. so if we see on UCAD Hourly Time Frame its on the wave 3 ? And also your 3rd point, can I assume we just re-enter follow the previous price movement. If previous is down ... we just follow until we got stop out ? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hello, Yes, USDCAD Wave 3, an extended one ! For the expected size of the move, it can be gauge with Fibonacci levels. For the entry system, I recommend to read BWs' book #1.... Everything is described there... And many examples are given in this thread and even more on my website.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Thanks a lot for the confirmation. I'm visited your website. can you please post your the entry level as well ? since as I know you enter using 30 minutes time frame. Which signal of BW you use mainly ? BDB, SAO, or Fractal. Since Its not mention in your website. Sorry you to busy you with my question. Thanks n Regards,

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi, For now, I'll not post my entries. I have personal reasons for that. But I can tell you that I'm using fractals. I'm trying to give all what I can understand of the wave and Fibonacci system described by Bill Williams. All the best. P.S. All the charts for the day are posted on my website now.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi Starskovsky, Thanks for your reply. Can you please advise the step of your analyzing until go to smaller time frame for open ? Since I a bit nerve after I enter in 1 TF and see bigger TF. Will visiting your website for the counting. Thanks n Regards,

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hello, you can start by looking at a monthly, or weekly or daily time frame. Then you want to find a significant move. Then you have to manipulate the time frame in order to fit the move in the 100-140 bars in the past, this is what I call the "zoom" part.... This is clearly described in BWs' book one. I hope this help ! I wish you happy trading.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hello ! Nice bounce from the 161.8% and AO crossed the Zero Line. It looks like a wave 4 is on it's way !

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Here is my 60 minute count for the EUR USD and a look at what may happen next. (If you look at the falling DOW a rising Euro makes sense.) The 5th wave is often has a diagonal five structure. We will know if that is the case in a day or two. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...0%20minute.jpg

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hey Wab, I totally agree with you, I'm planning to grab some on the way up... As you said, we will see

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Here is another nice looking chart that is worth monitoring: The wave ii level is between 0.62 and 0.76, just as it is supposed to be. There is a nice bearish divergence on the RSI9 and a down fractal at 1.0564. (It is hard to see the fractal detail as the chart is compressed a bit.) This could be a nice trade with a wave iii target of 0.9782. That's 782 pips from that 1.0564 fractal, but another higher fractal could still form. The count will change if the wave ii label is taken out. On the daily time frame there still is a bit of room for the price to move up to the upper resistance line, so the jury is still out. There is no accounting for some of the things the Canuck Buck does. So again, it is a case of trade the chart not the predictions - even when they look so nice. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...0%20minute.jpg

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Is this system using fractals for entry signals? I thought that fractals was repainting so I don't think it's very good for entries. I tried it before and it was always making signals late and I got slammed ! I'm reading more on BW systems now, but I wanted to know if someone knows a way to make repainting fractals give a good signal.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Wab, This chart is EURUSD, not USDCAD. All the best

One more time I'm completely in tune with what you see ! I'm ready to take some on the short side, but I agree that there's some room up. No hurry to enter... Bye !

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hello, here's a chart for AUDJPY. We had a nice double bottom, corresponding to a divergence on the AO. Usually it means that the current trend is running out of steam.... If AO will cross the Zero line, we will have the minimum requirement for a wave 4.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hello everybody, Here's a longer time frame. The pair seems to find some sort of support at the 50% of Fibonacci retracement level.... Today, we have a lot of news, be careful !

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I like that chart and your thoughts are in line with what I'm thinking as well. If the FOMC statement doesnt shock anybody I think we could move into a wave 5 down.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I sure like your charts star. I wish GFT had those chart capabilities.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Here is a chart for EURUSD. this is a "By The Book" one ! (So far Prices are now at the 61.8% Fibonacci extension. The target for a wave 5.... When W5 does not fail ! We have now 3 DB, a lot of divergence on the AO.... There's a possibility for a sharp move up (wave1), then a retrace of 38.2 to 50% (wave 2). Then, wave 3.... But, the higher time frame shows more room for the down side with a possible target in the 1.3750 area.... I hope this will help !

--- 帖子 #568 ---
One thing I have noticed that might be a small clue towards wave counts. Check where the AO goes really flat, like it does on the last red section of the AO in the chart on post 563. That AO flat area, is often quite recognizable as a B wave. When you look at your charts keep an eye out for that characteristic flat B wave appearance in the AO. Just one more clue that sometimes leaps right out at you.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
OH ! Interesting. Let's try to follow that ! Thanks Wab

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Maybe the wave counted as attached

--- 帖子 #571 ---
I really don't like to trade seriously from 5 minute charts. However, this one of the AUDJPY is a classic in terms of Chaos, AO and Fractal behavior. It may even be good practice to look for charts like this on the short time frames to imprint the AO and alligator behavior on our brains. They are always part of the larger time frame waves anyway. So, I thought I would post this as an example that shows that the AO and fractals work on any time frame. I wouldn't want to watch a chart like this for one hundred and forty three five minute bars? (12+ hours). Nice stress free daily trades are much better. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...20fractals.jpg

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi Wab, Thanks for sharing. In your experience have you found that taking the first fractal breakout following price action crossing over the Alligators Jaw, works well. fxpilot

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Nice chart Wab. Great example!

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Mostly I think if you stick with BW ideas they are the easiest and best. Only take fractals that signal above the red alligator for long trades and the opposite for shorts. If I try and get smart and take a lower fractal in a shorter time frame it sometimes works out when the higher time frame confirms it as a good entry and the higher time frame fractal subsequently gets taken out. You have to be pretty sure that a turn in the wave structure has happened when you try that. That can be costly when you get too self-sure and your internal wave count is wrong. Better to try for less, and be more certain about that, then try to force a bit more from a trade. But ...I really have spent a lot of time trying ideas to beat the fractal entry as BW teaches it. I haven't really done too much that is reliably better though I think you can gain a bar or two on a fractal when the circumstances are right. I would really like to hear opinions on this one: If you trade from the inside of a fractal (or the right side of a fractal) that can help. You have to think of fractals a whole lot differently. If you use your left hand to represent a fractal. You enter a trade above the thumb of a down fractal (when your left hand is pointing down, palm toward you.) Exit at the thumb of an up fractal. (When your left hand is palm away from you.) Trading from thumb to thumb. BW mentions thumbs in Trading Chaos, but I didn't think that he was thinking about trading the area in between one fractal and another as he usually trades breakouts past fractals. Here is a daily AUDJPY chart that shows two thumb to thumb trades. (T2T) Thumb 1 to thumb 2 (305 pips) then reverse and thumb 2 to thumb 3 (158 pips.) You can see how thumb 1 gets you in 5 bars earlier than the fractal signal above the red alligator line. Thumb 2 gets you in earlier as well and gains 35 pips over the fractal entry, but it does expose you to more draw down. You would use the AO to keep you from placing trades against the trend. So, I have revealed one of my Chaos secrets or what I thought to be one anyway. Maybe it is already in use elsewhere. If not, I claim it. I really respect the expertise on this thread and look forward to hearing from the masters. Is this a new chaos idea? Is it useful? Or did I just not understand what BW was saying about thumbs in the first place? If it useful, I can still take you further inside the fractal, but let's see the reaction to this first. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...to%20thumb.jpg

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hey guys, I am using the gator for entries. I let the gator confirm direction, then place a stop order at the new high/low to enter the market. It works well on M30 EURUSD but I mis alot of trades because of my schedule. Has anyone seen or heard of a gator with an alert? If so can you post it or msg me with a link? Thanks all.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
That is really interesting Wab. I personally have never heard of it. How often do you use it? Do you have any other criteria you use when you take this type of trade? How successful has it been for you overall?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I use the AO to give direction and beyond that, it is something that I have only experimented with. I can make it work from deeper in the fractal but that gets a bit more complex. The BW stuff works so well it is hard ot improve on, but this is one of a couple of twists that I have played with. Sort of contrary BW thinking. Since it is fractal based, I thought this would be a good place to throw it out for debate.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Looking at some charts and live action today I believe you are on to something. I want to monitor this to a greater degree as it could have tremendous results.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
It is funny how often we look at charts and really don't see them. There are a few other BW fractal things that show up when you turn the process inside out. Try a few charts and we can play with ways to use the T2T.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi, I never heard about this Thumb. Can you please give more sample how to identified the thumb using AO ? It is have to be after fractal ? or we identified the higher time fractal and trade it in lower TF ? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #581 ---
That sounds good. I do have a live chat site at my signature below with a BW trading room if you are interested in talking there too. Its free to join. I'm just looking for other successful BW traders to make some money with in the forex market and to help others that want to learn too. Do you trade mainly 2hr time frames as well?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Mostly I prefer daily charts. Time frames have to match your life style and daily charts suit me best. Recently I have been trying to apply the BW method to shorter time frames, trying to get trades that line up in 5, 15 and 30 minute charts. This is an attempt to avoid large draw downs. "Thumbing" from the inside of a fractal is an attempt to enter earlier than that first fractal above the red alligator line. Sometimes the signal occurs at the same bar as the BW entry fractal. It can also occur on a bar which is in turn identified as a new fractal, two bars later. Often a Thumb signal is a lot earlier than the BW fractal entry. Sometimes it too is above the Red Alligator Line. Perhaps we can look at this together and determine some useful rules for it in its various locations. I have my own thoughts but I don't want to bias any fresh thinking at this point. Nor do I want to hijack a Chaos Thread. If this isn't Chaos Related though I would be very surprised.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi Wab, Can you give sample on trade in shorter time frame 5,15, 30 minutes line up ? . since I know 5 minute chart will show set up first compare to 15, 30 minutes. Do you mean we wait for 30 minutes show set up and we go down to 5 minutes ? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Sounds good. Would you mind putting up a few charts as examples? It doesn't matter what time frames you choose. I would like to get very clear on the location of the bars you identify as a Thumb signal. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
hi does any1 have an indicator to signal/mark the 1st wiseman signal? aka the divergent bar.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hello there, Long time no see ! Sorry about that... I was busy trading and we really had a very pretty start of the year ! (so far...) Here's a nice situation on the Cable, check the chart.

Hi Starskovsky, Great chart! I am trying to understand what your chart is saying. There is divergence. Do you expect an up move to the target 4 wave line on your chart? Thank you. fxpilot

Yes, exactly. I'm giving more details in the members area, check the link in my signature.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Here is an another classic: This one a AUDUSD, M5. By using what I call a thumb entry and confirming the direction with the AO color change you get in a whole lot earlier. I added the wave count in the AO because it is such a nice one. The draw down after entry from either the thumb or the fractal was only 4 pips, but the thumb gives you an extra 20 pips lead in the trade. I attached BW Wise man and BW zone indicators, I found both on the net under those names. The Zone Trade is displayed on the chart. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...n%20aususd.jpg

Hi guys, I have written a simple Bill Williams EA. Will work on it some more next weekend. For now it has no externally configurable parameters. It trades: - Fractal breakouts - AO cross with trend - AC 2 bars with trend - Cancels all stops once the price crosses the gator - Trail stop with either: * One of the alligator lines (default is Jaw) * 5SMA stops (moves SL to the high or low of the 2 bars crossing 5SMA). It only trades with stops/limits on each bar close so there is no issues about inconsistency or "repainting EA syndrome". After watching it backtest over the last year or so on EURUSD H4 it is very apparent that this system does exactly what it is supposed to: keep your losers small until you can hit the big winners. Equity curve confirms this.

Hello Sinner- Looks like a very good job you are doing there !!! I'm very interested and curious of the results ! If I can help, just let me know.... I already have some suggestions... BWs' system is working on any market, because it is based on the very structure of the market. But I noticed certain things. 1) Signals has to be taken in accordance of the Elliott waves principle. This is not a big problem, because an EA can be turned on and off and can only take long or short.... 2) I'm using BWs' to trade futures market and for some reasons it shows way more consistency than on Forex. On FX, I think we might have to use certain types of signals only. Like only the fractals, the saucers... One more time, this is not a big problem, because, on an EA, it is easy to turn on and off such and such signal and gathering some statistics... I hope my input is a little bit helpful and let me know if you need some help, I'm always happy to participate to any kind of work on BWs' strategy ! Have a good day.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hello Wab, I like this entry ! Also, just before, we can see a nice double bottom with a very pretty divergence on AO. This really gives some clues that the previous down move is out of steam !

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hey mate, What I have noticed (and added code in the EA for) is that the BW signals (all of them) only seem to work when the Gator oscillator is showing a red bar for that trend. If you are looking for short signal then it is only valid if the "below 0" half of the Gator osc is showing a red bar. If you are looking for long signal it is only valid if the "above 0" half of the gator osc is showing a red bar. For example: Two AC sell signals. One nets 90 pips, one is a dud. How can we know in advance? Gator oscillator shows a difference. For the first one the below 0 Gator is showing a red bar. For the second it shows a blue bar. We only take the signals (fractals, AC, AO, balance line whatever) if Gator shows a red bar for that trend.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hey ! Oh ! I understand your entry and your filter. I personally don't use the AC nor the gator. But I'm interested. We will have to do stats on that. As an example, on your chart, I like when the odds pile up together. On the wave point of view, I assume that the retrace is a wave 2, so I'll look to go short, for the W3. Then (my red line) we have this fractal and it matched with the saucer sell on the AO. I like that kind of confluence.... See what I mean ? Let's continue !

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Yes, do you notice how for that signal (fractal+saucer) the Gator Osc shows a red bar in the "below 0" half? I just used AC as an example, I use Gator red bar to confirm all my BW signals.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
hummm... At the moment the resting order would be triggered, I'm not sure the conditions matched with your rules....

Guys , i have just noticed you are talking about these EA .I bought for £23 the chaos trader EA from forex-experts.com.I have used it , i will start using it on demo account first and see how it performs.I have to be honest with you , i have since left my day Job , and i am doing reallly well in this forex business , just trading Bill Wiliams .4HR, 1HR and 15 MIN..I guess i am an expert now.

Here's a chart of euro... This is a zoom inside the recent move down...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Here is an alert for Wiseman 1. It is actually an EA rather than an indicator and it inserts text at the top left of the screen. It looks at the previous complete bar and will state "NO SIGNAL" or "Bearish Divergent Bar" or "Bullish Divergent Bar". The way I use it is to tab through all the pairs on MT4 as soon as the bar has completed. It works on any timeframe and could have an audible alert but I haven't written that in yet because I don't need it. This will tell you when you have a potential signal ie the bar will be outside the Alligator lines, the close will be in the lower half of the bar for Bearish signals and upper half for Bullish. Also the bar will have a Higher High than the previous bar for Bearish and a Lower Low for Bullish. You will have to decide whether the bar conforms to the angular requirements of the BW system. I have only just discovered Chaos and I intend to develop this as time goes on.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Duncan I just realized that this is not an indicator at all...how do you apply to the chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #606 ---
i trade , 15 min , same entry points , i.e i only use breakout of fractal and normally if its in conjuction with cross over on AO, exit only when the market closes below the red line, dont really care about candlestick patterns , i do the same on 1 hr and 4 hrs , but that means if yu want to do it , u shld leave yo day job and do this full time , i normally start at 05:30 am till 10pm , remember , when the candlestick closes below the red line , u dont exit but yu put yo stop at the low of the candle stick , plus spread ,plus 1 point. try it , the other thing is i do gbpusd, gbpjpy, gbpchf and eur yen , the idea being that , they dont always move the same way interms of the alligator exits , etc , so when one trends , u make money on that one .

--- 帖子 #607 ---
The key to Bill's method is finding divergence between price and the AO. Learning to spot this will give you great success with his method. The problem with the EA sinner has made is that the AO and AC will change the colours of bars previously formed. Some times as many as 3 back on lower time frames. I dont think you will ever get great results with it.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Here is a setup im waiting for. The AO is a wave 3, the min requirements for a wave 4 is crossing the zero line. If this happens I will look for a bullish divergent bar with angulation for an entry long. This should give us a great entry to ride the 5th wave. This is a 15 min timeframe. Remember too that FOMC minutes come out today.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hi Tafadzwa02, Thanks a lot for your help. Btw, if you trade on 15 min do you need to see trend in H1 ?or just trade on 15 Min alone ? Thanks,

i generally lok at 4h , for direction , since i will be tarding it anyway , its not dificult.I trade 15 min as it is, since for a trend to start , it starts from 5 min to daily so, i trade 15 min and follow the same rules .I have noticed that on 15 min , esp if its against the major trend , i get a lot of whipsaws , i lose more trades on 15 min than on bigger time frames.But in the end , i win overally , like over 100% at the end of the month .Trust me , if it was possible to post my tardes every 15 min , 1hr and 4hr , i wld juts to show you how i will be doing.

You are right. It is an EA so you need to put it into your Experts folder then drag it onto the chart from the Navigator - make sure you enable Expert Advisors (Tools/Options/Expert Advisers/Enable Expert Advisors) or click ExpertAdvisors on the task bar. I have found an indicator (attached) too. I run both at the same time.

i will just tell yu my trades to day , like i said , i wake up at 5:30. so my sell stop was at 1.56441 on gbpusd , i did not put a buystop coz of the trend on the hourly , plus there was a midpoint on 1.5673.if the market had left a fractal above that point , thats where i wld have put my buy stop .at the moment @ 11:46 British time , i have moved my stop to 1.5672.i wiil exit when my stop is hit , or when it hits the high of the candle stick that closes above the red line.the same concept applies for the rest of the curencies i trade

Great trade mate. You were in well over 100 pips profit on that one.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I have improved the EA (new version attached) so that it gives you the Buy Stop or Sell Stop level and the Stop Loss too. You can choose the number of pips above and below the bar for the order and stop level. If you are using a 5 digit broker such as Alpari you need to enter 10 for one pip, otherwise use 1. Go to inputs tab when you drag the EA onto the chart. I find this really useful. Another feature I thought might be useful would be to shown the amount of Angulation but this is making my brain hurt at the moment because I can't decide how to do it. Any ideas?

Here is a 15min chart of the USDCHF. I'm waiting to take a trade on this. See chart.

The move up from the wave 4 has happened however no clear entry point appeared for an entry. You could have gone down to a 5 min chart and taken a fractal buy. I did not do that and missed a nice 60 pip move. O well will cetch the next one. Im trying to show the power of divergence between price and the AO in trade entries and how easy it is to spot the wave count if used properly.

Hi Don, WM3 its mean Fractal breakout ? so everytime got fractal breakout in EU M15 .. you enter and take 10 pips ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #645 ---
hey can you explain all custom indis how they work? btw sinner wrote an EA ..no news?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
WM3 means fractal breakout with trend favoring alligator opening

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hi Nathan, How you enter the trade ? since I saw you enter before WM1 show... Thanks

--- 帖子 #648 ---
u dont need custom indi at all..just never be greedy and use good MM that all...

--- 帖子 #649 ---
yes WM3 is fractal breakout and it must go with balance line red below or above not where it formed but where it hit, if u have read the book u will know what i am talking about... yes i often have 2 chart on my screen now eu and gu 15tf i wait for price to trend below of above and look for the first fractal form below or above red balance line, when i see this . i set pending order with spread and sl @ previous fractal before my entry point with 10pips tp....yes risky but price will always trend after taking wm3...demo it before using it ....it depend on ur acc size and wat u want to risk..i take 3-5 trades per day...

--- 帖子 #650 ---
When do you interpret wm3 donfriday? How many pips are you scalping and how many wins versus losses? I think 15 min tf's are great and I would like to refine my trading consistency using them.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Experience with Chaos System and confident. WM1 signal always a gamble mode WM2 signal trading mode WM3 signal investing mode (add on position in sync with WM2 direction)

--- 帖子 #652 ---
the first WM3 on eu or gu 15tf at london open ....only 10pips man...just how i want it market can still do more but it's my decision to do so....lose is common but as i dont open more than 3-5 trades it will be less...

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Excellent interpretation! Forex37

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Do you always start at WM1? Do you add on with WM2 or WM3? What time frame(s) do you use?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I'm more comfortable taking WM2 and WM3 signal. WM1 depend on how confident u are with the signal with some reasonable conviction. example on the AU setup with AO signal that showing Hidden div.

Hello There ! Nice situation on the euro 660 min. A triple bottom, a nice Trend Line with the fractals, nice divergence and a possible target for the wave 4.... What do you think about that ?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
NZDUSD, is probably now in a wave 4... We can see a possible target for this retracement. Greetings !

--- 帖子 #662 ---
We can see that prices reached and pierced the 100 - 110% Fibonacci extension area, a usual target for a wave 3. The next step is the wave 4 and you can see a possible target area, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
I agree that the EURUSD is setting up for a bullish move; my count on Dailies has us nearing/completed wave 5, although I'm but a beginner in counting waves. I'm curious why you choose 660 min. (11 hr.) bars? Why does the "Trend Line with the fractals" come into play for you?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hey Guys , I am interesting in Bill Willames trading system , and i have two questions hope to find an answer What is the best time frame for trading?? what are the best currency pairs for trading?? Tkxx

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Chaos, which the Williams system is built upon, is in every time frame. However, they suggest an absolute min. of 5 min. bars and you'll find, at least I have, that the more successful traders tend to trade larger time frames. It's my understanding that the Williams family "bread and butter" time frame is Daily bars. There isn't a "best" currency pair or commodity. There are however "best" trade set-ups. Ultimately you will want to scroll through many charts looking for a market condition you can "dance with" for profit. For example, you will find nice divergences between price and the AO which can prepare you for a reversal.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Thank you so much , I can see its working good on the larger time frames , but the only problem is the stop lose will be too much . by the way , what do you think about this divergence on the 5 mins chart ( GBP / JPY ) ? Isn't it kinda risky to go long while the price under the alligator?

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Why would the stop loss be too much? Just adjust your position size to accommodate your desired $ risk. With a mini account you can trade 0.01 lots which is a penny a tick on USD ending pairs. Small time frames, particularity in FOREX, are full of noise and for me more difficult to trade profitably. There are multiple entry strategies, some of which would include entering long under the alligator. I would suggest reading up, starting with the most recent book, 2nd Edition.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hello ! With BW's strategy to count the waves, it is necessary to enclose the move we are studying in 100 to 140 bars in the past. Then, all the information given by the AO are exact. To do so, we have to manipulate the Time Frame in order to enclose the move in this 100-140 bars area.This way of doing is described is his 1st book. I've found the TL Break with FT as a good indication for an entry, when in tune with the waves. I hope this helps ! All the best and feel free to ask any questions.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Once you have the EW figured out this becomes a very pleasant process. I actually took both of these M15 trades in my sleep, only waking up briefly to place the second order. Where else can you make close to 2k while you snooze? (Politics maybe?) Do any of you BW experts also draw trend lines on the RSI? http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...w%20chart..jpg

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Great job ! But I think that what you called a wave 4 is actually a wave 2, according to the Fibonacci retracement. W2 usually retrace between 23 and 38%, sometime to 50%. A wave 4 retrace usually in the 68.4% area. Also, when you look at the AO behavior, it seems that it created a new Lower Low... It is usually a good indication of a wave 3. Anyway, whatever the wave was,you made a nice entry there ! Have a good week-end.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
I have to agree with you and admit the 38% turn was a lucky one. I will run that one through ElWave and see what it says. Either way the fractals work wonders.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I thought the 100-140 bars was a matter of zooming, which could be done on any time frame? Please explain your method of manipulating the time frame to enclose in 100-140 bars as I can have "any" number of bars on screen on any time frame which confuses me. In the meantime it sounds like I need to revisit his 1st book *off to read*

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Yes the 100 140 bars is used for zooming. You start on an higher time frame and find a significant move. Then you manipulate the TF in order to enclose this significant move into the 100 140 bars... I'm using NinjaTrader to adjust the TF, it is easy. I don't know if it is possible to do that on MT4.... I hope this helps !

--- 帖子 #676 ---
IC. Yes, MT4 is very limited in this regard. Perhaps I should have kept my TradeStation account open.

--- 帖子 #677 ---

Is anyone aware of John Carter's adjustments to the William's indicators so that they are more effective for currency trading? His reasoning was that the indicators weren't originally developed for forex. I don't recall where I found this mentioned but evidently Carter, who wrote "Trading the Markets," presents these adjustments as a type of fine tuning. (I don't think this info is in his book.) Swamper

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Never heard of an adjustment to the indicators, what's needed are adjustments to the system. As you say I, it wasn't developed for forex. In fact his daughter indicates that he has never traded forex. He, himself, says that he only trades commodities and commodity etfs. Forex is a totally different market from commodities. So his understanding of the market is limited. Essentially in forex price just swings around a central line and actual moves are pretty small. They only appear big in your account because they are leveraged. In commodities it tends to be just up, up, and away. I can't imagine that modifying the indicators would make much difference. The alligator is just three moving averages. The fractals aren't modifiable (except by ignoring them and some should be). The AO is just an Elliott wave oscillator without the signal line. (You can put it back, just add a 5 period average to the AO.) The real problem is that his trading signals are geared to a different type of market. Those I think need to be re - congfigured to better accord with the cyclical nature of forex. Think on that instead of numbers, and you might come to some useful realizations.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I've read about Williams and his lack of experience with currency. I've also read that he occasionally trades currency and favors the 30m TF. It may be that the Carter alterations also included method changes and/or additional indicators. I don't recall the exact wording of the original comment. I'm just interested in seeing the information. Swamper

Guys , it it me or what. i keep losing money , since almost 2 months ago now. whats goin on in this currency trading. this seems to have no end.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
What end did you expect? I highly suggest reading the three books by Bill Williams - at least 3 times each - I see so many people comment about these (and many other) books and say "the method don't work" etc., but it's rather apparent by their wording/charts/etc. that they don't understand the methodology and probably finished one a week ago - haven't done morning pages, or thought counts, etc. Anyway.....Bill has traded for ~50 years, is a multi millionaire from trading (not selling trading books), and gives classes at his house where he trades the live market with his students.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
trust me , i have made more than 15000 pips since last year in August,i trade 15min and hrly , but the last 2 mnths i have lost bout 7000 pips , its not right , i trade cable , euryen, gbp yen . i havent changed my startergy but its getting to a frightening stage now. if u remember i posted a few mnths ago that i was doin very well with this system but hey , its not working right now.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I believe this methodology has been working for ~30 years now? Remember, we all ultimately trade our own individual believe systems. Are you/have you consistent with morning papers? Just today, trading Dow mini, I turned a ~70 tick profit into a ~100 tick loss because I didn't take profits at the end of wave 5 of C. I thought C was 3 so my plan was to wait out 4 and take profits near the end of 5. However, my wave count was off, and combine this with a bit of greed and you get a loosing campaign. So we never loose, we only win and learn. From now on, I will take profits during wave 5 of C or 3 and look for a re-entry on wave 5. Had I done this today I would have my profit and also not re-entered because the market showed me I wasn't in complete tune with it's direction. So, I'm off for a swim and some sun; back to trade the FOREX this evening.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
It's you. You've got to learn to "want what the market wants". When you do the losing will stop. Just quit and watch the charts a while until you understand what the above phrase means. Look at the chart for the last two months and ask yourself "why on earth did I lose", because there is no reason on earth to have lost a cent trading this market. The downtrend was obvious, the end target of the downtrend equally so.

Check your PMs.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Taxgeek, I've noticed that you've posted quite a bit over the last few years concerning Chaos Trading/Bill Williams. Would you be willing to share your modifications to his system? Considering that it was created to trade commodities and that it isn't an end in itself but a beginning, I'd like to hear your thoughts. Swamper

--- 帖子 #702 ---
You don't have to really modify anthing. Just remember to trade with the trend. If you fight the trend, you lose. Look at the chart in my last post. Where would the best entry points have been? Obviously when it left the up trend, the first trade would be the fractal break. Once the trend established itself, where do you want to enter? (Remember his entries are for the commodities market not forex). Obvious place then becomes, when price reaches the blue line. Once the trend establishes price doesn't go too much beyond the blue line. Look at the alligator as a dividing line rather than a signal line. In your brain, you know where the market's going. It's as simple as this, if the market is going up buy, if the market goes down sell. Exactly where doesn't matter too much. Just use multiple microlots, small enough that you can hold the trade. Any short would have made money on the Euro, if you held it long enough. Stay off short term charts. The brokers have every advantage on those. On the long term charts, you have all the advantages. None of their hijinks will effect you. The Elliott waves become obvious if you look at the alligator. Every time his mouth closes a trend wave is complete. It becomes easy to know whether you are in a trend or coutertrend market, which is what's important. The wave count also becomes easy. Fib projections off wave 2 and wave 4 will give you the probable end of the trend and your exit. There you have the distilled wisdom of several years of working with the alligator. It's also not exactly the chaos system.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Thanks for your response, Taxgeek. Which time frame works best for you and what method do you use for your S/L? Do you follow the S/L approach outlined by Williams? Swamper

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Daily or 4 hour. I don't use SL. On long time frames they do more harm than good. I've been taken out of excellent trades by the banks stop loss hunting. On daily charts you need about a 300 pip stop to be effective. So why bother? Chances are if it goes that much, it will turn around and retrace half, which means you would be better off not to get stopped.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
How many trades do you get in a week or month trading daily's and how many pairs do you trade? Do you say have 3 or four trades going at one time and do you add on positions as Bill suggests?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Thanks Taxgeek. I've been using primarily 4HTF with references in both directions, but with a SL. Without question though every time I enter a SL I have a feeling that it's too tight and I'll get clipped.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
AvidTrader, Didn't you mention BW's recent switch to the RSI in place of the AC a few months back? Swamper

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Not many. Depends on how many times the chart hits a good trading level, two or three at the most, but then forex trading is about making profit not setting records for the most trades. What would you rather have at the end of the month a thousand trades or a thousand pips profit? Trade frenetically and your broker will be the only one who gets rich. Only Eurusd. Yes I use microlots and keep adding as the trend progresses. I don't copy too much of his system anymore, because I realized that it wasn't built with Forex in mind. He takes trades too late and puts stops too close in a market where (if you pay attention to your brokerage agreement) brokers reserve the right to show you a chart different from everybody else in the world (that's you as an individual not all their customers). They can do that, maybe they don't, but at times I have watched a spike move just far enough to trigger my stop, I've certainly wondered and checked a couple of times to find out that it wasn't on other charts. I have watched a trade on a Metatrader chart and traded on a non Metatrader chart to see as much as a 100 pip difference develop between them. It was the difference between making a profit and losing. Luckily I was trading on the undoctored chart. That pretty much convinced me that to win, you have to trade on the long term charts that can't be manipulated as much. I can trade on a one minute chart and win 9 times out of ten, but it's just not worth the stress and time either. I have plenty to do with my time besides trade. Actually I just trend trade. Of course, that's what Bill's doing, he just disguises it more

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Have any of you tried using a stealth stop? It is a indicator that is on your chart and is triggered to sell by price action but the broker can't see it. I will see if I can find it if you are interested.

Here are a couple of trades that went very nicely, using the first fractal above the red alligator line. The first is the M15 EurUSD. Exit was on the lower of the last two recent fractals as shown. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...cent%20m15.gif The second is a daily trade that is still in progress and I expect is a wave 4 correction. Both a pretty much pure Bill Williams trades. God bless that man. http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...ad%20daily.gif

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Beautiful Wab !

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Wowww interesting... Where did u put ur stop loss wab??

--- 帖子 #716 ---
The stop is just below the lowest of the last two down fractals when long and vice versa when short. When the move is seen as being near completion (near a Fibonacci ratio with indicators showing weakness, internal wave count etc) you can move your stop to just below the low of the last three bars or even just below the low of last bar. You can also look at a lower time frame for clues. Exits are never perfect but the goal is to get as much of the move as you can. Even when the price hits a Fib ratio exactly I think it is wise to place a TP a bit early. Bird in the hand stuff.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
oo ic.. do you always take the first fractal above the red line??

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Nice looking trades, Wab. What factors went into your decision to take those particular fractal entries? Two fractal trail does seem to work nicely, was that something Bill talked about in one of his books? I don't remember reading that, although I use it too. Will you post pictures and describe your specific exit strategies for these two trades?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
hey guys, Bill mention about a squat bar, but i dont understand what is it can someone help me?? thx

--- 帖子 #720 ---
The books have all the strategies in them for counting Elliott Waves and using the Alligator and fractal stops. I think Alpari also has a good summary on it. I usually get in trouble trying to take earlier signals than the first fractal above or below the teeth (red line.) All I can say is read the books over, over and over again. This tread and some others like it are also an excellent resource. Be careful though, as some other boards, discussions are wildy off the true "Chaos" path. As for squats, a Doji bar is often a good thing to look for near a bottom or top. Volume data varies from one broker to another so MFI use in Forex is open to debate, though some people swear by it. I keep my eyes open for dojis and RSI divergence. Every chart teaches you something new.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
The divergence between the price action and the momentum indicator is an early warning. It can be used for entry confirmation. It tells us that the move is almost ready to switch to the other direction. So, we want to find an entry signal. It can also be used as a warning for exits, telling us that the move we are currently riding might be over... The use of Fibonacci ratio gives us even more clue and helps us to draw a pretty accurate map ! Please check the attached chart and if it is not clear, feel free to ask any questions. All the best !

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Another nice situation is when you have a double bottom with divergence on the momentum indicator.... Check the chart.

--- 帖子 #723 ---

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Thank you! Here's the fib extend and yes we're a little above 100% of wave 1, or A? I made the decision a while back to take profit near the top of wave 3 and/or C; this way even if my wave count is off I keep profits with the expectation of splicing back in after the market starts it's next impulse. I suppose in time as my wave counting skill improves I may not do this, but for now it seems to be a reasonable strategy to keep the account growing. Thoughts?

Entry off Daily Wiseman 1 with divergence. Looks as though wave 5 on 1 Hour chart is nearly complete. Anybody with suggestions to forecast end of wave 5 for profit taking?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
This is a very good way of practicing exits, in my humble opinion. A profit is a profit ! If you have several contracts in a position like this, maybe you can do a partial exit and keep a runner, in case the wave 3 extend to up to the 161% area... Or if the market is in an abc mode and will retrace up to the top of the previous down move... Just some ideas....

--- 帖子 #732 ---
On your charts, it is difficult to say in which wave we are. In BW's strategy, in order to have reliable information given by the AO, the move you are observing has to be included in 100 to 140 bars in the past. However, by looking at your chart, it seems to me that the little bump above the zero line is a wave 4 inside a wave 3 of an higher degree. What is a possibility now is that you will have a retracement up to 61.8% of the down move (this will be the wave 4) and then, a test of the low again (the wave 5)... But, by looking at the D1 chart, it seems that we are in an abc mode... Not in impulse mode. Regarding the wave 5, in Forex market, I rarely saw it going lower/higher than the extreme made by the wave 3... We usually can see a double bottom/top, rarely a new low/high....

Ok, I couldn't resist... Here's the chart for GBPAUD... We are at an interesting level, a retrace of 100%.... Both directions are widely open.

euro on the hourly chart

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Oh ok ! So, the situation is now in the past since a long time.... Can you post a chart please, let's have a look ! Here's an example on euro 1H with 4 tops in divergence ! As you can see, only 1 fractal signal triggered. All the best.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Yupp tats the one, yeahh i should've taken that fractal.. there're 3 wm1 form and triggered there, i took 2 of them and my stop loss got hit so im too scared to jump in hehe.. thx starskovsky, this thread is awesome, looking forward to see ur chart again..

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I would like to also thank Starskovsky for his input; has been very helpful to me too. Alligator, I'm curious how you can trade this system on 1 Hour bars. How do you monitor positions every hour until each trade completes? Do you ever sleep?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
haha of course i sleep... usually i just enter and put a stop, then i'll just check every 4 hour to put a trailing stop (previous 3-5 bar high or low).. depends on the situation or i can just put a limit order for taking profit.. what timeframe do u use??

--- 帖子 #740 ---
I'm settling in on Dailies. I've tried many timeframes and other methodologies over the past few years, and Bill Williams Dailies seem to be right for me. I'm also occasionally trading 15M charts. Dailies make sense also because I will be starting a new job soon and won't have the time to stay in front of the PC all day/night. I started a $5000 demo account ~3 weeks ago and it's currently $9700 trading almost exclusively dailies (little bit of break-even 15M chart). Granted, my risk levels were a bit high in this demo account, more than I would risk with a live account, but regardless the balance is moving the correct direction. I'm using Windsor out of Cypress, who offer Dow, Oil, Gold, Silver, etc. and 27 pairs. Anybody traded with them live? How was the live experience? However, I do enjoy intraday tick chart trading, which I was able to do last summer for a while. Finances aren't allowing that now, but I will get back to it in time. Does anybody trade BW methodology on intra day tick charts? How would this type chart affect, if any, the AO or methodology as a whole?

will this carry enough momentum?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
hi fxtaiko, Nice trade there... How long u gonna hold your shorts? Any specific target?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
how are you Mr Ismail. Frankly, it is still trading reversal. Fork channel suggest buying. We'll see this channel to be broken.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Yes Nathan, your short is looking good, the probability is in your favour! Fork lines may be broken in stages..

Hey guys, did i count this elliot wave correctly?? Need some input... thx http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7snXyA5aQb...0/untitled.JPG

--- 帖子 #758 ---
I'm no expert, yet, but I have it counted the same as you and short at roughly the same level as you. Now management - how do you plan to manage the trade? I think this 5 wave move we've identified on 4H chart is/was an impulse on Daily time frame, so we are effectively short the Daily corrective wave which has a target range of 38.2 - 61.8 of the impulse.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hmm, looking at the hourly chart, it seems wave 5 probably not over yet, what do you think? Looking from your chart, i count the target zone would be around 3376 - 3805 If it not go up to that area, I would sell if it breaks the trend line and put my stop loss at 1.3260

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Good call, I was too early.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Does anyone has the same euro wave count?? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #762 ---
You may be right, although I have the retrace as being finished; either way it would appear that we're near the next major impulse wave entry.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
yupp totally agree with you... if we got it right, we'll be riding wave 3, a joy to behold

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Hello all, I'm back home and updated some charts.... Posted there : http://bit.ly/a4PH9b I'm ready to discuss wave counting again !

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I'm in. Should my current S/L be a stop and reverse?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
3? price?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Very nice call Unchained! Now we should be looking towards 1.4950 for a top at minimum for this wave 3. The question is, does it need to pause for a little longer before moving up? Regards, John

If you wish to survive in trading game you must scalp the market only when is safe to scalp! It is all about drawdowns!

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I think we've finished wave 4 and started wave 5. Sorry for the delayed response....

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I thought lets put some life back into this thread as well. You had a spot on Buy trade there. I wonder if you're still in it. It did retrace quite a bit and closed on red line on 11th of Feb, You must have exited, if yes, did you go long again. thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #772 ---
I trailed two fractals back and got back on board. I need to move my stop up and start looking for the end of what looks to be wave 5. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I'm short silver WM1. (This is a "short term" trade, I'm VERY bullish on sliver long term; I'm buying physical bullion).

--- 帖子 #774 ---
great trade looks like you got the timing right here what a tanking it has had

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I've covered; such an aggressive move probably followed by retracement and I was looking for support 35-37 range anyhow. I'm short AUDCAD but the more I study it the more I think I'm on the wrong side of this market...we shall see.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
This works GREAT!!!

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I was short too soon after all. Anybody share their opinion on wave count for AUDCAD?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
What is the difference between indicator mode AC mode AO?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
AC mode "false" gives AO MACD, whereas "TRUE" give the Bill Williams "AC"

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hi guys, great thread here, I am learning this system on demo - got a question, how do you watch for or anticipate a quick turn around? Here is a chart to show what I mean, first the Alligator sleeping, as it would during weekend and Asian session, then breaks some fractal to the downside, after Europe opens, there is a gradual turn around in 15 Minute trend. Do you just be aware of this as a possibly on the 15 minutes chart? Was the down move a fake out? Do you take signal from the AO? I entered a buy as you can see, the first fractal, but only marked the others; anyone actually trading 15 minutes like this? I looked at 1 hour charts, but looks to me by the time there is any fractal signal most days, 12 hours has past.... Thanks for any tips boys &amp; girls

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Talking to myself here I see, where are all the CHAOS converts? Grabbed a quick 50 pips on the CHF+USD, broke the fractal and away we go, check it out

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Callisto, How did you choose which fractal to use for entry? Where did you place initial stop? Why? What other rules do you use for exits?

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Check out the link in yousafzai signature; more than enough answers for you over there I'm sure

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Thank you Erebus, but I was asking specifically for his decisions on the trade he posted about.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
It uses JAVA 6 to run see... http://fxoo.org/

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Not only a good Chaos trainer, but also a fantastic site!!!!! And those links to youtube videos teaching Chaos ........ Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #787 ---
maybe Imram has an opinion? When a WM3 or proper fractal is taken out, do you use candle close to verify, or when during the candle price action "touches it." ie a limit order Thanks

--- 帖子 #788 ---
When price exceeds the fractal you have your entry - that is presuming other criteria have been met. Candle close is relevant really only to WM1.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon1.gif Alligator crossover alert I spent many, many hours hunting for an Alligator Cross alert. I finally found an indicator that almost does the job. Unfortunately the sound doesn't work However, I think all Chaos fans will find this most useful and maybe some kind soul will get the sound working for us. You can set this indicator up and it should give you a sound alert and an arrow when the Red Alligator line crosses the Blue one. The arrows work. Settings are: true, false, 2, 8, 5, 4, 2 13, 8, 4 Or you can set it to alert when the Green line crosses the Blue. Settings for that are: true, false, 2, 5, 3, 4, 2 13, 8, 4 Land of cash is working on an entry system based on a MA shift crossover for their LOC Trader ea. (Do a search on FF for LOCTrader.) With that, you can then choose your choice of trailing stop strategy. In many ways it will allow Chaos traders to get an automatic entry on an Alligator Cross over and then trail a stop along one of the Alligator lines. Sleep may be possible again if we can get the sound part of this alert working.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
made new version of this indi: you can now choose the TF in the parameters

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hello is anyone still using this thread?? lets have a go?? Mark up

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Still using this method off and on. I find it requires lots of watching to be there at the correct time. Then it works really well. What I would really like is an alert for when the price passes the first Fractal above the Alligators Teeth /Red line. That would reduce screen time considerably.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Why not follow B.W.: Not waiting, but placing Buy/Sell stops a few pips above/below fractal? Regards

--- 帖子 #794 ---
That's a given, it is just a long wait to get to the correct fractal and a lot of chart watching if you use a LTF. One thing I have come to like is that you often get a second chance to enter at the first signal, as price often pulls back to the breakout level and/or even lower and fills a limit order. I have attached an indicator that I find very useful in this type of breakout trading. Basically a fractal breakout alert.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
... Ignored An excellent post full of information; just as relevant today as it was in 2009 * the system has only two entries 1. a bullish or bearish divergent bar 2. a fractal breakout above the red line of the Alligator. It's extremely simple. * Add ons trades are accomplished using three Awesome Oscillator bars of the appropriate color or adding at each fractal breakout whether current or historical

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Too nice not to share, 400 pips and counting

--- 帖子 #797 ---
WOW just WOW - if anyone can be the kiss of death...... it's ME Immediately 200 pips the other way Oh well, hopefully some price action as previously, form a fractal to the downside I'll be watching

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Read and tried BW for decades, literally, never really worked but Im still trying it... There used to be a system which moved the trailing stop according to the AC!!! You start trailing a close on the red line....as per BW original. BUT, if on the way, the AC goes negative or positive against you, you either trail a one bar stop, or at least the close of the green line (lips)... In your example you would have locked in much more $, following that tweak. I personaly trail any close above the green line on small TF (any day trading), markets are way too volatile... BW works best on Dayly Weekly and Monthly... If you have the patience and keep adding on say: a 4 hour chart, but trail the weekly, you aree bound to cash in tons of pips...but it takes a lot of work, and a lot of patience...

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Anybody still trading chaos second edition? NZDUSD 30 Every little coloured signal below the bars is a short entry signal (chaos indi for the second edition of BW) Consider the potential of the move, entering on a fractal way back up, an adding a short lot per signal. Exit: a close outside of the blue line. Massive profit multiplier.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Brilliant fxhermit! I too like to use multiple timeframes, so your D1, H4, M30 timeframe combination fits perfectly ... thank you so much for sharing this thought, which has been a really brilliant insight for me!!!

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I love it! Your Blue Light Special explanation describes perfectly a way to implement the idea that has been buzzing around in my head about not going in directly on fractal breaks, but waiting for a retrace back up before entering a Short trade (opposite for a Long trade. I also love the idea of using this as a potential scalping technique, and perhaps also as a means of capitalising on a D1 / H4 / M30 Multi-timeframe setup. Genius! Thanks again for sharing this.

Dear, I have written an expert based on NTD of bill williams and I am testing it on different time frames and symbols to see what are the results. As I realized the maximum loses are when the market is in a range mode, Can anyone help me about how to discover that is the market range or not in the NTD system to improve my expert? Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #363 ---
dear traders, I have programmed an EA to trade by NTD system of Bill Williams. The results for AMAZON_CFD(daily) from 01-01-2018 to 31-08-2020 is as follow: as you see it is in profit at last, but it has some fluctuations as in range periods, is there any other one here to trade with this system to avoid trading in range markets?
