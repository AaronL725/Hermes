Any real account forward results bro?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
back test's are available in the original thread. i just finished it so no, no real accounts yet

--- 帖子 #4 ---
why the thread been moved to commercial section ? the EA Is 100% free to download and use , no limits no restrictions i hope you move it back to trading strategies because more people going to benefit there

--- 帖子 #5 ---
hello, tarwada I'm testing in several pairs while M5 and closes all at once it's all false, but it closes all pairs

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Good Luck On your Testing !. I appreciate any feedback please consider reading the full thread as it has a lot of important rules High Flying Trading (HFT) Method by Dreamliner

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hello Tarwada, Congrats on starting this tread in line with DreamLiner his ideas, Commercial or not I start next week with the EA are still planning to coding the NLD into the EA. AJ

--- 帖子 #8 ---
The second you mention "donations" the moderators see it as a Flag.. ..........

--- 帖子 #9 ---
it's all false, but it closes all pairs

--- 帖子 #10 ---
please read the original thread to understand why the EA close the trades Enter Long When the Price Closes Above 34 SMA add Extra Positions after every opposite candles close Exit if Prices Closed below 34 SMA Enter Short When Price Closes Above 34 SMA add Extra Positions when opposite candle close Exit if Prices Closed Above 34 SMA donations are optional , not required for download and/or use anyway my goal is to let more people benefit. that's why i wanted them to move the thread to trading systems as there a lot of people searching everyday

--- 帖子 #11 ---
im working on NLD anyway lets see who can finish first

--- 帖子 #12 ---
if i removed my emails , will the moderators move back the thread to Trading System ? im serious

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The system need to be improve. remember market only trend 30% of the time,so taking every closes above/below the 34 SMA is oing to kill your account.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Dear Muhammed, Before you start distributing any thing for free, kindly first experiment things on your own self, just like how doctors experiment medicines on mice and rabbits before giving it to humans. Please open a small real account, do some forward testing, and then start distributing it to people.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Dear its too early to involve money here in this thread. I am not sure that anybody including you will trade real account in such a way. Its a shortcut to either blow your account or become a millionaire. So 50,50 chance. Its gambling.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
first : i didn't FORCE you (or anyone) to try the EA on a Real Money Account (there's something called Demo accounts) second : if you're considering your small Money Accounts as mice then that's not my case anyway , being a negative person is something up to you , but respecting other people's efforts is an important behavior i had a little bug in my EA and i fixed it. everyone agreed in the original thread that this Strategy is a good one before writing such a comment , go there and read the thread and then write your "valuable" comments here and there

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Denial is first sign of failure, any ways good luck

--- 帖子 #18 ---
im going to add (Max Trades) as soon as possible

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Rather Fixing Number of Trades, Relate your Re-Entries with your account margin.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
could you give me more details please ?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi. Pleas ad tp

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Brother, You can set a certain % of your margin to Allow trades otherwise not. With the philosophy to initiate a new trade with each opposite candle, you are fully exposed to get a margin call.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
got it , thanksim not native English speaker so that's why

--- 帖子 #24 ---
there's a close all trade whwn profit reach x in money , set it to true then enter you preferred amount

--- 帖子 #25 ---
No Problem Muhammad, You can even speak Arabic, English, Turkish, Urdu, Hindi or even french with me.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
هل تتقن اللغة العربية

--- 帖子 #27 ---
الأردية هي لغتي الأم. ولكنني أستطيع أن أتكلم الإنجليزية والتركية والفرنسية. لديهم القليل من الفهم العربية. أعتقد أنك الهندي في الأساس.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
my sets r and i bactested the all year it opens only 4 trade

--- 帖子 #29 ---
أمي هندية في الاصلlet's just speak English for now LOL

--- 帖子 #30 ---
i just updated the EA ,, download version v1.5 , its on my thread

--- 帖子 #31 ---
i like it

--- 帖子 #32 ---
tarwada, maybe some kind of security button on the chart to close immediately all trades? what do You think?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
there's a script that closes all trades , googlpe it , it's free

--- 帖子 #34 ---
many thanks for coding this tarwada, have loaded on H4 charts. will manually trade the daily charts using NLD like smoothtrader if this is a profitable EA you will definitely receive a donation

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I tried putting in my experts folder. It shows its there there is a grey dot next to the little expert icon but it will not attach to chart any suggestions Thanks

--- 帖子 #36 ---
here is the script that closes all trades

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanx, will check it later. I've seen that kind of scripts already but sometimes they didn't work. I dont know why...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
haha , i've just made it NonLagDot EA NOTE : all donations emails been removed , i hope that moderators move the thread back to Trading Systems as more people will benefit there thanks

--- 帖子 #39 ---
​Hi Ali, I backtestd it,looks so good. I make double account input is true,so 100 to 200 is easy,but 200-400 not easy,so I hope you can make a new input. "RISK",means when all positions closed,use 1% or 2% enqutiy (input risk 1% or 2%) to open new first position... Best Regard Liu

--- 帖子 #40 ---
which EA are you referring to when you backtested the HFT EA or the new NLD ea

--- 帖子 #41 ---
​HFT ea，use EURUSD Daily...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
great thanks. have loaded it on ten H4 charts, cant wait for open to see what this baby will do next week. will trade the HFT system manually on daily charts thanks again to tawada

--- 帖子 #43 ---
HFT method did talk about putting SL for each position on previous Highs and lows, this drastically minimises the overall DD and risk of trading this system.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hii, maybe you should add NLD for filtering.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hello Tarwada, Thanks for the NonLagDot variant but damn what to do with all that pips when no donations can't be made AJ

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi tarwada, Enter Short When Price Closes Above 34 SMA add Extra Positions when opposite candle close Exit if Prices Closed Above 34 SMA Shouldn't the entry be "When Price Closes Below 34 SMA"? Thank you for the EA.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks tarwada for your effort and sharing the EA. I also think that adding NLD and adding orders by stop orders will be less risky. Let's see what the results say in the future. Green pips to every one

--- 帖子 #48 ---
yea sorry , I've miswritten that ruleI've corrected it

--- 帖子 #49 ---
you're teasing me LOL

--- 帖子 #50 ---
hello all I inserted to my renko chart, and changed ma from 34 to 120. Below 120 sell abov buy. Looks nice, opent trades what i opened manually. This trade closed manually i see here double low on renko. Some filter maybe need near ma, if price near ma open and close trades. thx for this nice ea tarwada

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I tried the EA in DEMO with GBPJPY chart. I put 10$ tp. but when the profit reach it closes one by one not all the lots. Also it closed other open position. Kindly fix the bug.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
gu short ea

--- 帖子 #53 ---

--- 帖子 #54 ---

--- 帖子 #55 ---
So when you will close trades? it wont allow to close manually. Message comes prohibited by FIFO rule.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
add more shorts

--- 帖子 #57 ---
nofting for mee ?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
wait, open on oppsite candle

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Had a little fun running your EA this morning, tarwada . Thanks for making it. Here's an observation: Started running it on OANDA demo (1 min chart to watch it work live) wondered why trades weren't closing - then looked at mailbox and Journal. Needs a mod to close oldest trades first to work with US brokers, the logs are filled up with this kind of msg: "Trade 195391440 could not be closed due to FIFO violation Your trade could not be closed because you have an older trade on the same currency pair. To comply with NFA FIFO regulations, you must first close your older trade. For more information please refer to: http://fxtrade.oanda.com/trade-forex/metatrader/faq#fifo"

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hey mate. What do you use to get renko charts on your screen? What do you download.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
well... Adding FIFO-friendly feature wil take some time. instead switch to another Broker and as a recommendation , try FxChoice , the accept us traders and they love EA tradersif they saw you profiting using an ea , they will contact you and will ask you if you'd like to promote your ea on their website and MT4green pips

--- 帖子 #62 ---
thank you for sharing this EA. looks very neat. has anyone done any optimization, to reduce the draw-downs? can wait for the automatic lotsize calculation.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hello tarwada, Thank you for your work

--- 帖子 #64 ---
HI Tarwada Please answer my questions.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
this is because the EA closes all trades at once , FIFO means : First in First out , please switch to another Broker (FxChoice for example) this is not a bug , once the profits reach 10$ , the ea will close everything, it doesn't close the profitable trades only.green pips to you

--- 帖子 #66 ---
There are following problems in the EA what i observed: 1. EA dont close all the trades at once even profit target reached. ( set Manually rule 2 option TRUE) rather it closes one by one. 2. It closes all other open positions also. 3. When candle close above MA it dont close opp trades, rather it closes few and some position open also. I m testing in GBP JPY 15 chart. Please chk Thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
does your broker follow FIFO rules ? please Change the broker

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Be careful! I just accidentially switched timeframes on the chart where the EA was installed and the EA closed ALL my positions (not just the ones opened by the EA, but ALL!)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
OK Let me now change broker

--- 帖子 #70 ---
yes , if the closing rules met after changing the TF , all the positions will be closed. also note that you must leave the EA trades alone without manual trading

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Dear Tarwada I changed broker. Now it closed all trades at a time with Targated profit. But it closes other open positions. Can u make the EA not to close other positions? Also can u add magic no so we can put in multiple chart Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
you can't trade this EA with manual trading because it will be very risky. for the magic numbers , i can only add an input to give the initial trade its magic number , the add on trades uses Random Magic number generating algorithm.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Tarwada. Thanks for your share your EA. Could you add order magic in EA setting at next version. I think it can ask EA to run in different symbol. Thanks so much

--- 帖子 #74 ---
So do i just need to place the EA on my chart and let it run, or is it needed to also apply a Moving average on the chart with the same period as the EA?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
EA working fine. What I want , suppose i put the EA in EU and i have some open position on Ucad. What I want is EA should close the pair where we put. It should not distrub other pair. Regarding magic no: I just want to put this ea in different pair different time frame. I am sure you can do it. Thanks advance

--- 帖子 #76 ---
no problem , will be added place and let it run , that's it i think that i've covered this problem , took 2 days to find an alternative way to randomly generate Magic numbers for the add-ons trades the update will be released in few minutes with BIG IMPROVEMENTS ! , REALLY BIG

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I´ve checked the EA and it gives me a 10% loss since start 2014 with the default settings. I suppose I´ve done something wrong, could you please post a image with the trading results since the start of 2014 and the settings you used.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
no one is doing something wrong. to achieve success with this EA : i will make updates based on your suggestions and ideas. once updates made , you test it and give me feedbacks and new suggestions. so every new version will be more stronger than the previous one. by the way , i've made a very big UPDATE and will release it in few minutes so keep your eyes open !

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thank for clarifying it. Will check out the update as soon as you post it! Happy trading and wish you all green pips!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi traders! Im happy to see such great EA's. First of all i like to tank tarwade for make such great tool! for improvement i have some becaue the problem with almost every EA based on moving averages is everything will work fine until price will chopy, consolidate, so what i suggest what will be a good improvement is stop trading after one cycle as an option so lets saye you expect a swing higher gbp/jpy you will trade just the first signal break above 34 and it will add just like normal on every red candle! but as soon as the price breaks below 34 the EA will pause for so it will manage the open possiotion with a break lower is closes them lets saye in profit but it will stop that waye its gonna be more like a semi auto trading tool! but ill expect it to perform better because when you see price is choppy you just dont add the EA and dont let it trade! Hope this improvent can codet into the EA because i think its a great waye to limit risk

--- 帖子 #82 ---
The New Update is Out oh... sounds very good so instead of closing trades , it will wait for x number of candles to Confirm the Break , am i right ?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi yes thats another update! But if im correct the following will happen, lets saye price breaks above 34 sma it will buy add to that position till it breaks bellow the 34 sma correct! when that happens the same cycle starts in the oposite idrection so short and adds for every bullish candle if im correct? but i think that will make EA lose on the long run because a lot of time price go's in consollidation mode after a mayor move so you only wanna right that first bullish move like you expected and after that you want the EA to pause you bankt the profits your done. After that you watch yourself and put in on when you expect a next mayor move down or up! but it will stop after the first signal or atleast there should be an option catch one swing cycle and then pause the EA! I hope this makes sence

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks Tarwada I will test the new verson

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I don't know why but your template is not recognize by my mt4. Its the first time that something like this happens. Could you please tell your ea settings? Just change the SMA to 120 or anything else? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
check back older post. here is photo from my change.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
ea buy positons.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I read all the posts here. And I was not asking how to set up renko and the ea (I only trade with renko, so that, for me, was the easy part). I was just asking if you made some more changes in the HFT ea settings or just the SMA period. Thank you anyway. Many pips to all!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
My renko chart set up 4 pip renko box. All market type need to find ideal box. For gu good 4 pip box, but for example: oil need higher box size

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Tarwada. I am testing EA2.0. I found some bug: 1. BE &amp; trail stop. some order not apply this setting. 2. EA cannot re-attach. Add-one magic number will return to init magic number if re-load EA. For example: Add-one open one order magic number is 2001. If i Re-load EA. the next open order magic number also 2001. So open order fail. 3. first order will open 2 order. Kindly help to check. Thanks

--- 帖子 #109 ---
tarwada can u insert in ea this modification? price higher than MA and lower than nonlagdot dont open position, and if price highert than ma and price close higher than nonlagdot, and nonlagdot change colour, from this place open position?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Can anyone explain what is no of doubles setting? is it the initial setting multiplication? Anyone experienced new verson EA? what time frame will be better?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
hello Number Of Doubles Means that the Trades Will be Closed if the Open Profits is x2 or x3 than your account balance for example , if you put the Doubles 1 and you have 100$ in your account , then the trades will be closed if the open profits is 200$ next , all the trades will be closed again if the open profits is 600$ (because you had 100$ + 200$ profits = 300$, and 300$ Double 1 = 600$) i hope its all clear now

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thanks for reply. Is there anyway to restrict no of positions opened? in whispaw market it opens lot of positions.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Tarwada Would be possible to have the option to choose another type of MA and not only SMA? Like the indi that I post here. Thank you for all your work.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
i add this ma cci indi this is indicator what i coded, maybe can use to filter. can change ma and cci period.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
what do you think guys of this indicator as a filter for flat market condition (Aroon Up Down) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #116 ---
aron nice indi if u can build in ea maybe filter well

--- 帖子 #117 ---
buys stopped out. i stop now ea near ma not to good to run open buys and sells and close this positions. this sell close too now

--- 帖子 #118 ---
are you running full auto or manually intervening?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
No all time i watch for all eas. This downside move i wait to come ea dont see. Look lower high on upper band, show bulls lose thier power. But i wait for ea stop. Somtimes bether to run ea full auto, somtimes bether to intervening manual Depend from market type

--- 帖子 #120 ---
this is not a bug , don't reload the EA , if you want to reload it while some orders are open , change the magic numbers (change all magic numbers)

--- 帖子 #121 ---
this move cant see ea s.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Some bug looks here. Max 3 allow in settings and opened this trades

--- 帖子 #123 ---
wrapocs, thanks for what you are sharing ​ ​ BUT, could you please share your set file for the EA?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
If you could implement that indicator to your EA, it would help a lot i think. Because it would filter out bad trades. Because currently in backtests there are good months and bad months and trailing stop/BE make profits smaller while not really affecting the bad trades too much. I tried different settings in backtest the entire day and I just can't get October 2015 to be profitable right now. So yeah, an additional Indicator would help probably.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
it's so natural that you have "some" losing months. this is how things works actually. the key is to keep these losses as small as possible while multiplying the profits. for filtering i think im gonna use either MACD or Aroon. if you have any ideas , feel free to share it

--- 帖子 #126 ---
check my older pictures tarwada I show place to entry with nonlagdot big ma good for trend nonlagdot or small ma good for filter can u try this?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
you Post million of pictures, all the charts are messy. i can see ichmoko cloud and trend lines and so much indicators that does not relate to the EA. if you want to explain your own idea please open a thread for it

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Can anyone tell me what is the idea behind using MA 34 why dreamliner used this, i asked this question from main thread of dreamliner but thread seems dead.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
It seems not working with my setting. Please share your setting. However, I think you can add working duration for the EA.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I don't actually know why the MA used 34. For GBP/JPY I had the best results using a period of 110, while GBP/USD uses a 80 period and the targets of both pairs also differ. I think it just depends on the individual pair. Test it out and play around with the settings a little.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
it seems that you didn't read Dreamliner original Thread. there's no secret behind 34 SMA and GBP/JPY. the 34 SMA suggested by Dreamliner and GBP/JPY is a high velocity Pair. that's it. the default settings aren't the perfect settings

--- 帖子 #132 ---
This is what i think, maybe this photo bether

--- 帖子 #133 ---
During the last two years I have lost about 130k while developing my trading systems. The only thing that had happened to me, was that I got INSPIRED by all those loses. I had realized, that the chart is like a road. A strategy is like a car. If the car accelerates on an unknown track (or road), it is likely it will crash. The same way, most, if not all, trend catching EAs are accelerating on an unknown roads (charts), not knowing when there will be a curve, why not an u-turn, not having any breaks, not slowing down to eventually prepare for the upcoming curve(s) or turn(s)?!? That is exactly why they usually crash. So does the account. Drive ANY car only with a gas pedal and see what happens... That is all about loses. Natural loses.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
somthing is still wrong my ea is not doing eny trade all day lond

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thank you very much for the new update! Will check out the new features now

--- 帖子 #136 ---
It seems you are going to transfer 130K more in brokers account brother. Be careful.

Hi guys!! Im new to forex, so alot to learn yet, im being searching online for the best tools and lessons to become the best forex trader i can be, im doing all the no deposit forex just to get a feell of the real money i lost it all . Now im doin demo accounts and tryng systems and strategy . Its a learning curve until now the best ive seen for free of course was this EA and the Paradox system im tryng the 2 systems in 2 dif accounts. Paradox is cool but need alot of knowlofdge in forex i like this Ea but it seems it need some tweeks i tink a trend indicator in the EA was cool like a arrow and saying trend dow or up so we can hve the rigth filter to the EA, but once again im new to this so sorry for my english, im a little obsessive so im learning and seing video all the time so in one motnh i can learn alot, i was introduce to the forex in december since then im reading an seing everything. One thing for sure u going have lost trades just need th right balance to short the bad trades and keep runing the good ones, its just the way it is u just need to make the right decisions and try to have profit evry day i tink maibe a shorter stop loss increase the profit cause when the trade is wrong u go out early but we hav the problem of smuthering the trade so im struggling a little . So just want to say ty for sharing this EA and im gonna do my best to try to improve with all the effort i can put in this EA. In time ill be doing a little group onçy dedicate to improve skills in forex skype calls and share screen, but for now just learning with all of u guys. Thank you.

hello my friend. the forex market is simple but not easy, yea , there's a big different between easy and simple. as a suggestion, try renko charts with basic trend lines break. and thank you for testing my EA !. i believe that one day , someone will find out the good settings for this EA. good luck and be aware of scam brokers. go only with trusted one (i use XM and pepperstone ). be careful

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Thank you for responding me i really apreciate it Im tryng the renko charts they really cool, with buy and sell alerts, just to see the price action, i tink this ea will benefit from a trend indicator to help filter i put the stop lost to 100 pips lets see im tryng also in alot of pairs, will see but for now im not in profit. IM gonna keep tweaking and posting

--- 帖子 #141 ---
​thank Tarwada, I have tried and run good but 2 different broker it trades different. the on broker MFX it on ly trade GPBUSD, broket Tradersway run more pairs EURUSD,GBPUSD,GBPNZD,CHFJPY,EURGBP,EURCAD

If you are new to forex go to Alien extraterrestrial thread here on forex factory read it full to be a successful trader. Just an opinion.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
ty il check it, all help and all information its always good, even if we dont agree with it.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
If you are new to forex, you need to go on babypips(or similar) first...not to the thread filled with thousand indicators system...I am not saying that Alien's system(or whatever) doesn't work...I don't know,but I think that it is not the best system to start with(and,indeed the majority of threads on "Trading Systems").

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Im new, but not that new, but ty for the advice i apreciate, the basics i know quite well, support resistance, price action, the the analysis techincal and fundamental, the power of fib XD, all the beginners books i already read, one thing is for sure there is no miracles and the learning curve is big at the moment im no profitable trader thats why i use demo account and test EA and strategies

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Judging by what you write-you are "that new". "the basics i know quite well, support resistance, price action, the the analysis techincal and fundamental, the power of fib XD, all the beginners books i already read"-I think even pro traders don't know as much as you. Books?C'mon,none of them gonna make you succesfull,at least I have not seen any. This EA's,"thousand indicators" systems,S&amp;R,S&amp;D-it's a typical way for "understanding" fx market.And 95% still struggling with this believing that in one day some script/code/indi will lead them to success.As you are at the very beginning of this journey,I want to suggest you-get away from this type of thinking,save your time. I am not a pro,it took me 4&amp;1/2 years to UNDERSTAND "what is going on here?!" and first 2 years I wasted on "magic" EA's,indi's and other worthless things. Does this mean that you can't try all of this things?No.You SHOULD try them,but you need to carry out only what is important.500 pages "how to trade" book?You will find 3-5 pages which are worthy of your attention.Same for any trading systems threads.You need to find only that suits you and the over 5% of traders. GOOD LUCK! The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.― Albert Einstein Cheers. Prox.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Totally agree with Proximius. Wasted a couple of years trying to build the perfect EA. Ended up ignoring everything I was told/read to do. Nowadays I don't look at anything other than linear regression and a bollinger bands indicator. 46 lines of simple code and still going strong.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I know exactly what u mean and really apreciate that exist good people like to teach newbies like me. One thing iknow doesnt exist magic in trading its normal we all search for the quick way to make money but i really like the part of looking charts and i really know at the end no ea or ind gonna mke me money its like verything u need to be prepare and do best decision in the rght moment, just u need in formation to make more than 50% the right call and u will make money if can reach 70%,90%, better that what im aiming for and yes im really new to forex but has i said before i obsessive wiht things and i tink That a ea could be agreat help not to do everything but sometimes u cant trade cause odf the emotional side i already see the babypips back to back btw... i like simplicity and normaly thats what work best alwys im doing alot mistakes and still not profit but i dont give up that easy... But many thanks for uyour opinion guys i really apreciate an look foward to learn more wiht u both guys

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Yes, my friend thanks for sharing this EA tarwada. Any ETA when you will have the version with integrated Aroon or MACD ready? Cause I would really like to test that and compare it with the normal results I would get.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Is the 34 SMA on the close or open price? Thanks Michael

--- 帖子 #151 ---
close .

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Tarwada, As you requested, here is a backtest of HFT_v2.0 EA on EURUSD, 10pips Renko chart. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #153 ---
First of all Thank you for the EA. Your post# 308 says SMA is not on Close. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...23#post8744623 Also are you planning to incorporate your post# 316 as an update in the EA? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
is this the best settings you've found or it is just the defaults ? maybe ...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I used the default settings. I'll try to optimize the input parameters to see what the best I can get out of your EA.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
For what it's worth I can share with you my best settings I had with the GBP/JPY pair. Even though I did't use renko charts it may help you in your backtests: Attached File(s) GBPJPY.txt 1 KB | 661 downloads You have to change the ".txt" to ".set" to load it in your MT4 obviously. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
there we go ! , thanks Math and Acer for your feedbacks ! can you Post your Backtest or forward test please ?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Tarwada. I am very new to Forex Factory and the world of EA's. Great efforts by the way. I have downloaded both your recent EA's, HFT and NLD and I am trying to backtest them. I have got NLD running on the Strategy Tester in MT4 but I am not having much luck with HFT - i.e. I cannot seem to get it to place any trades within the backtest. I am running it on H4 TF. I am using the default settings just to get started, but I have obviously missed something as it runs through the time period without posting any results. Please can you guide me with any ideas that may spring to mind. I have attached my .set file as a .txt doc for your perusal as I do not know how to capture an image of them using MT4.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hello, is it possible to have more than one chart and one EA in the self account? Or they block each other? Thanks Michael

--- 帖子 #160 ---
yes but you have to change all the magic numbers

--- 帖子 #161 ---
click "reset" when you backtest the EA and make sure you have enough history data

--- 帖子 #162 ---
And if i also want to use your NLD-EA?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
still the same thing , use different magic numbers and all should work good

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Must i enable magic-number in nld? How must i activate it? Magic_Number_Settings? Greets Michael

--- 帖子 #165 ---
magic number is always enabled . put random numbers for every input

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks Tarwada. I looked again at my setup and found that my lot size was too small - I trade on a Spreadbetting Demo account in the UK. Was receiving the error Invalid trade volume ..... in the testing journal. Thanks again for your time.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I have applied the EA with different magic numbers on seven charts (30M), but all open positions were closed once there was a closing signal from one of the charts. (I have set the True for Close position Rule 2 for all charts only, this criteria was never fulfilled, so the problem might not be this setting). Please review. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
yea that's because the EA will close all trades when exit signal occur. the problem is that im using random magic numbers generation for all add ons trades and there's no way to know it to close it per chart .... I'll try to find alternative asap. for now , you can try it on one chart only , sorry for that

--- 帖子 #169 ---
forward test on TickMill . Login: 2089050424 Investor: anc7klo

--- 帖子 #170 ---
settings are : exit when open profits 100 and exit when open losses -100 , the account been doubled several times

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Tarwada, Your work is highly appreciated! Thanks for your feedback!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
checkout the forward test above and let me know about your thoughts

--- 帖子 #173 ---
this is based when your account is 100 or a different amt to start with? I see the forward test Drawdown is quite high at 50%......

--- 帖子 #174 ---
yea , the idea itself is dangerous. im wondering why the members keep asking me to add the ability to run it on multiple charts

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Tarwarda, thanks for your EA, i back test with EU, 5m, this version did not close all position when target reached. trailing only working with few olders orders. I suggest we calculate a new TP when we set a target. for example, if we begin with 0.03, buy at 1.10000, Target 30usd, TP will be 1.10100, but if lot size increase to 0.1 lot, new TP will be 1.10030

--- 帖子 #176 ---
what do you mean by "when target reached ?". are you sure about this ?. it works well for me

--- 帖子 #177 ---
also notice that the trades will be closed on reversal close. so you're not actually risking 50% of your account

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Do we have put a (-) sign in front if want use the "You can Close All the Positions if open Losses is x in Pips" Example would i put (-100) or just (100) if i want it to close at -100 pips

--- 帖子 #180 ---
for losses stop : Write -100 if you want to close the trades if losses reach 100 remember to add the (-) First

Hy and thanks for sharing... I see your bu orders but wich tf are you using cause price il below sam34 in 1htf? I've also opened a new demo account and i've this message https://gyazo.com/d5353f1884db1f898baa34d079cd7cd3 Is this normal? Regards

--- 帖子 #187 ---
looks good, i'll try to ft.. thanks tarwada

--- 帖子 #188 ---
H1

--- 帖子 #189 ---
What actually is the exit signal? As per my understanding it is when the candle closes on the opposite side of the SMA 34. I am using it on a demo account and have observed quite a few times that even when the above condition is not met, still all the trades are closed. Other thing all trades are closed when the magic numbers for all the 5 pairs are different. For example the magic numbers input for First pair are:1 (initial buy), 2 (initial sell), 1000 (Add on buy), 2000 (Add on sell); Second pair: 3, 4, 3000, 4000 and so on for the other pairs. Below are the input details. You think there is some bug or I am doing something wrong? SMA_Period=34 Initial_Lot_Size=0.01 Add_On_Lot_Size=0.01 Break_Even=0 Break_Even_Add_pips=0 Trailing_Stop=0 Trailing_Stop_Activation=0 Max_Trades=9 Magic_Numbers_Settings=Use Big Random Numbers Between Add-Ons I nitial_Buy_Magic_Number=3 Initial_Sell_Magic_Number=4 Buy_Add_On_Magic_Number=3000 Sell_Add_On_Magic_Number=4000 Extra_Settings=Extra Settings For Exiting The Trades Close_Positions_Rule_1=Close All Positions When Your Account Is Doubled x Times Close_Positions_Rule_1_is=false Number_Of_Doubles=1 Close_Positions_Rule_2=Close All Positions When Open Profits Is x In Money Close_Positions_Rule_2_is=false Profits_In_Money=100.0 Close_Positions_Rule_3=Close All Positions When Open Losses Is x In Money Close_Positions_Rule_3_is=false Losses_In_Money=-100.0 Close_Positions_Rule_4=Close All Positions When Open Profits Is x In Pips Close_Positions_Rule_4_is=false Profits_In_Pips=0 Close_Positions_Rule_5=Close All Positions When Open Losses Is x In Pips Close_Positions_Rule_5_is=false Losses_In_Pips=0

--- 帖子 #190 ---
thank you for this can you please post a screenshot of your settings and the pairs I should use for EA ?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
can i know your forward test is on what timeframe?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I think it is H1 like he said a few posts before

--- 帖子 #193 ---
It's probably on H1

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Is it on a 4 digit broker or 5 digit broker ?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
the test on H1 , exit after 100 open profits and -100 open losses , no max trades 5 digits , you don't have to be that specific

--- 帖子 #196 ---
yea right , as i mentioned before that's because the EA will close all trades when exit signal occur. the problem is that im using random magic numbers generation for all add ons trades and there's no way to know it to close it per chart .... I'll try to find alternative asap. for now , you can try it on one chart only , sorry for that

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I have noticed that even you if have manual trades open on the same account with different currency pair it will close those pairs when the total reaches the set amount that you have put in the settings.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
yea , for the same reason above

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi Tarwada, Could you tell me what're best time frame (TF) H1 or H4 it should be good to setting ? Thank you

--- 帖子 #200 ---
both works good , do some backtesting and see which TF suits your capital

--- 帖子 #201 ---
You are doing excellent job. Please add the two cents of mine. Risking 100 for 100 is not logical. I have worked with the technique. This technique is off nature which will provide you entry multiple time if your earlier entry hitting the SL. No Problem, you will get other entry. So i would advise to test with a tighter SL to keep your DD low. Ideally your SL should be above/below the high/low of the previous candle . This will help to keep the DD low. You can try with 50:200 or 100:200 .

--- 帖子 #202 ---
thank you tarwada Note: All operations were closed and do not know why? I put Basket stop -100 dollars put basket TP + $ 300

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hy please could you share your set file as your demo account with GBP /JPY? I don't have same order in my demo forward test... And I don't understand why... Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi tarwada, do you have a setfile for this forward testing demo account? It looks very good. But I don't know the exact settings. Lotsize, TP/SL and SMA period.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
everyone can see in the WebTerminal without downloading MT4: http://trade.tickmill.com I am always afraid of initial good EA results mean reversion and such..

--- 帖子 #206 ---
im running the test on H1 Time Frame apply this settings and/or download the set file below and load it to the EA Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) HFT v2.0 SetFile (Beta Testing).rar &lt; 1 KB | 3,556 downloads

--- 帖子 #207 ---
​Hello Tarwada You mean this set file should put in HFTv2.0 EA on very TF chart for run trade ? Thank

--- 帖子 #208 ---
the set file = the settings set the settings manually or load the set file also don't run the EA in more than one Chart

--- 帖子 #209 ---
You mean "also don't run the EA in more than one Chart" for same pair... cause magic number right? Regards

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Why not? If he put different magic number on different chart?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
yes , some users reported that even when you change the magic numbers , all the trades will be closed in all charts when exit signal occur that's because the random magic number regeneration code im using

--- 帖子 #212 ---
already did a forward test &amp; yes its closed all trades currently running either TP/SL (exit with profit 100 &amp; loss -50) its good at first when ea started before a trend (few pips above/below ma 34), but when in the middle of the trend the price sometimes make a retrace &amp; more likely we'll suffer drawdown (i know that no one know when the price start making a trend/retrace/reversal). i will try to see next week trades..

--- 帖子 #213 ---
hi Tarwada, You might want to check your EA, it didn't close out the buy positions after closing under the 34 SMA... I'm running a test and mine did close out accordingly and open sell positions.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
tarwada thanks for uploading your settings. can you confirm if v2.0 is a multipair EA? ie you load it on one chart only and it takes trades on all pairs? or do we load the ea on each chart we wish to trade? thanks

--- 帖子 #215 ---
So we can only run ea on one chart and only one currency pair. So if want to trade a different pair i can not because the ea will close all trades as soon as one pair has hit target even though the other pair might be in loss or profit so it kind of takes al the pairs it is attached to trades it like a basket, am i understanding this correctly? or there just a bug that needs to be fixed so each pair the ea is attached to can trade on its own setting TP AND SL ?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
[Quote = tarwada; 8780443] {quote} im executando o teste no Quadro H1 Tempo aplicar essas configurações e / ou fazer o download do arquivo de conjunto abaixo e carregá-lo com a EA {image} {file} [/ quote] Good day dear Tarwada. Sorry if my English is a little truncated, I'm from Brazil and I am using a translator. I'm working with your EA and I'm having good results, but since I am new to forex I am a little in doubt with EA configuraçãoes, will you help me? What are the settings in the trailing_Stop option and trailing_stop_activacion eg If I want a trailing_stop 30 pips? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Is here any chance to improve your EA, that we can put the EA on more then one chart?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
^ for the last 5 comments , yea the EA close everything even on other charts. there's no way to fix it but im working so hard to find a solution

oh man , relax. don't go Live with this ea yet

I will be testing this and will share results tarwada

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hello everybody, over the wkd I lunched a an optimization cycle, I will share optimization set up and best results once it is finished. just some initial information. I am working on GBPJPY-H4, i first run a backtest with default and identified a time window where at first the EA makes 30% in 3 weeks but then drops pretty much all of it so i decided to use that window for the optimization. ideas and comments are welcome.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi tarwada thanks for the great job! Is possible to modify the EA in order to chose a an EMA? best regards

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I really like this Ea and thanks for your effort.. Could be really nice if we could test with different pairs... and i can't wait your next update... Just one question about trailing stop.... I'm trying it and seems ok just for last entry.. what about all other orders opened? Thanks Regards

it works fine for me. try changing your broker....

tarwada thanks for coding hft ea 2.0. it is doing well, but some trades are not being taken for some reason. please see the screenshot, gbpjpy crossed the 34 sma this morning and i can see on your tickmill demo that trade is doing well but on my demo no trades were opened. the ea is trading on other pairs...can it be something to do with the magic number issue you mentioned before? thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I'm new and having trouble using the new indicator. The HFV 2.0 shows up in my indicator list but will not transfer to a chart. HELP! Is there something I'm doing wrong or a new version?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
longezav8r, try copying &amp; pasting EA into "Experts" folder not the "Indicators" folder. Look out for the smiley face.... happy or sad. click on face then tick "Allow live trading".

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hey, first i have to say thank you for this free and great ea too. Actually i making tests with this ea too. But test it on renko charts. There its more difficult to get a right positioning with candles which goes against the trades. So i only test it without the reentry feautre. Also the ea works like the nonlagdot ea. But now i have a different idea. In Renko charts exists situations with strong trends in one colour like here to see: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So my idea is now, to open for every brick a new trade not only for this one which will go against the trend. The reason is, to build big profits on long and steady trends. and if the market goes sideway, we only lost small positions. Now, what do you think about my idea?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
HI, Tarwada thanks for developing this ea. I tried to back test this setting for 2015 - 2016 GBPJPY 1H. but the result is a bit disappointing. did i miss any thing here?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Could you add the function to add lot for add-on position just like pyramid. For example: Initial position : 0.01 2nd: 0.02 3rd: 0.03 4th: 0.04 for step : 0.01 or like pyramid with 1.5 coefficient: Initial position : 0.01 2nd: 0.02 3rd: 0.03 4th: 0.05

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello all here Tarwada Awesome EA so far, here are my suggestions to it 1) Filter entry with pips faraway from sma 34, let say X pips ( could be variable like x=10 pips ) to avoid late entry and get some big DD 2) Add option to close all orders by % equity and start over next day at GMT set time.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Tarwada When you allocate random magic numbers why not precede them with a number unique to the instance of the EA so for example my EA allocates a number 123 and then various random numbers can be appended to this. When it comes to closing all trades you can just close all trades that start with 123? Mark.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Smart idea. I hope it can be implemented in the next revision. This way we can use multiple TFs on the same account.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hy... i'm trying this amazing system since monday morning and i catch (demo ) GPY/JPY trend... Look at my charts why i don't have any new orders? In my setting mx order are set to "0". Any suggests? Regards https://gyazo.com/3ccc64107bb8251b7b8c327cd846ee13

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Check your settings file. What do you have under Max_Trades Because it's responsible to limit the number of new trades.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I've run it in multiple time frames on multiple pairs and it has a slight edge. But the generally doesn't seem to make much. Am I missing something? Is there even such thing as an EA that makes consistent profits even with the spread. If so can someone show me one? I've looked around and you can buy them. But the reviews are bad, and suggest they never really work. Spose they wouldn't be interested in selling anything at all if they were actually making 50% a month. lol. Slow consistent earner EA. Has anyone got one they could share with me? Cheers

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Do you take profit manually and add another trade manually or will it add more trades on its own?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Yes i know and as i said i've "0" so no limit ..... Look a t my setting please... Thanks Regards https://gyazo.com/e903e2cc29c2438483f9518c7c50b684

--- 帖子 #243 ---
tarwada: Hey, programmer here . Instead of using a magic number just create at the beginning of each tick an array that holds the trades per pair. That way u can keep an array of orders that belongs to each pair separately. So when the time to close all the orders a particular symbol cause it reached the required condition then all u do is loop thru the array of that symbol and close the orders that belong to it. This will keep the other symbols and orders unaffected. If you wish I can PM u with the code I use, but it really depends on what you are doing in your init() function and how u structured the start() function or whichever function u are using. Let me know you need some help. Take care and good luck

--- 帖子 #244 ---
hi how to open multiple trade.like u r demo acc.i see u r demo acc is open 10 trade.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi Xmess7 Could you help me how to set it multi pair and its do not closed all trade ? I have problem even day at NY time trade (my time Central time US Texas) at 8:00AM it make closed all of my trade on all multi pairs ?? It happen every day Thank

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes, Yes there are. However they don't make you rich quickly and take time. The ones I know will not give you 100% per month, but they are consistent enough to make profits. I am using one on my trade explorer, but I haven't tested it that long yet.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
hi Mianlien: I don't have the source code. I can only offer the examples of what code they need in the EA, then it's up to the author to integrated into the code and provide you folks with an updated EA.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hey Tarwada, Thank you for your hard work. I tested the EA yesterday and it seems it use simple MA not smoothed. Is it possible or the tester is wrong?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
To be honest, I am conducting a forward test for USDJPY with settings : SMA 54 , Max Trades : No limit but with "Reserve Trade Coppier" and here is the result. It gave consistently profit over a week ( the drawdown caused by other EA). Actually, the BT for reserve trade also is profitable but not many. I really think that the EA should have option to trade the "Reserve order" and multiply the add-on order to get more profit.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
The consistent lose means the consistent win in reserve! The BT results

--- 帖子 #251 ---
$1000 done nice results from $200 to $1000

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hmmm .... Yes all that looks great ! Amazing results ! @tarwada: You did all that without any manual interventions ?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
anyone got idea why the BT result is actually not good?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Yep ! It's absolutely contradictory to tarwadas forward test !! But any forward test is more valuable than all these fancy + funny back tests strongly depending on the BT method and data used for it. By this way usually different broker provide different data = different BT results. So, presumably, you have here another example illustrating the very limited benefit of the BTs - may be the only advantage of BT is the possibility for coders to check out + catch bugs in EAs + indis they create. Some people reckon, that all the BTs to a greater or lesser extend are BS .... at least concerning the forthcoming results of demo/live forward trading !

--- 帖子 #255 ---
anyone who already forward trade this, please kindly share the trade explorer.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
The thing with this EA, only give you the entries. You need to plan the SL and TP properly. Depending how you want to play it.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Yes, right ! And tarwada posted this/his plan for MM (SL,TP) at feb 27 (see p. 11). You find his setfile he is using in his forward test with TickMill ... at least I hope/think that he use this setfile (Beta) in that amazing forward test anyone may follow continuously.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I don't know what the reason is, but his forward test on tickmill is somehow doing way better than mine..

--- 帖子 #259 ---
his forward test on tickmill is amazing...in a few weeks $800 with 0.01 lots...amazing indeed. im forward testing using his setfile kindly shared, but some of the entries are really late and way after the 34 sma cross.... sometimes missing a lot of the move (which on H1 charts are not too infrequent and large on a lot of pairs) will post some screens later when i get back home , and also edit this post with a myfxbook link to my demo tarwada any ideas? because with the correct entries this EA is hot fire edit: myfxbook link: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/trad...ada-h1/1542794

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Ok this is mine... but with many problems during the week cause for the last 2 days mt4 crashed and Ea stop to add order... I really like this way to trade unfortunatly Ea is not ready for live trading (IHMO)... I'd like to test with many other pairs ..hope for update soon. Thanks for effort Tarwada Regards

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hmmmm ..... The last 3 posts sound a bit strange ? Bcz of these differences I would like to ask tarwada: is he anyway intervening manually ? Or are where any other additional actions provided by tarwada but not done by the posters above with different results ? Will post here my MFXB link of this/my acc with the HFT bot asap.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
@blamshakk: your account with the HFT EA is doing a pretty good job ... so far !! Only one week, although .... anyway ... you use for 3k only a small lot size of 0.01 - tarwadas test is running with 200 as start capital - that's quite different to your acc ! @cescof: I'm curious about your tests with other pairs, although we can't use atm this bot with more then one pair. Honestly to say, I would run it even with the one GBPJPY alone. If I could reproduce tarwadas results .... his amazing gains are quite enough for a good income ....

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Keep in mind that this works good if a trend is there. A flat market will eat all you profits from past and much more. Strongly recommend test this for a long time in demo and never ever let it run without watching whats going on!!! It must be written in stone, the only thing you can respect is a solid price action analysis. After installing countless EAs and indicators, that is the only thing what is the right thing to get constantly profits with a proper Money Management. This EA only if the conditions are good. Greets Michael

--- 帖子 #264 ---
no manual things , the test is 100% Autopilot with no max trades , exit when profits 100 and exit when losses -100 , GBP/JPY 1H chart

--- 帖子 #265 ---
if you want to know why i don't rely on backtests, do a back test from the time a ran the EA with the same settings and deposit and see yourself

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Exactly!! Tried getting my head around how different it was for a while: Conclusion, backtest means nothing with this EA. Would be interesting to see if a 99.9% tick data test comes out any different.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I have been testing this strategy manually and i threated all open trades as basket trades, on 28 trading pairs. Maybe it would be a good thing to think in that direction for this ea , creating a dashboard which will control 28 pairs and threat all open trades as one basket with one tp or sl. Since now its very impractical to monitor 28 charts on the mt4.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I can guarantee that tarwada FT is really good and all trades are autopilot. I have tried FT as the same settings with tarwada. But it just seems working well on sideway trend. So I have tried to reserve trade with not sideway trend.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
@derberliner yes its doing very well. and its a very small lotsize to account ratio compared to tarwada, but im running it on multiple pairs flashbulb moment: you said this EA can only be run on one pair? is that due to the magic number issue tarwada mentioned before? this is maybe why trades on certain pairs are entering very late, is it becuase trades can only be taken on one pair at a time? if this is the case tarwada please can this be fixed. because it seems like an unecessary limitation - being able to trade an EA on multiple charts is a very basic feature, and this EA really does seem to work so its a shame to limit its potential like that any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
No special thoughts - all questions about multipair trading with this EA depend on tarwadas actions !

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I've had similar issues with both TP and SL. So far what I have found that what fixes it is doing a complete refresh of the charts after a take profit or stop loss. The way I've been successful is by saving the HTF setup as a profile, then changing to some other profile followed by opening back up the HTF profile. Also noted that it seems to mess up the EA if you use another order management EA to TP or SL.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Unsure why the tickmill test hasn't closed those longs. Candle has clearly closed below 34 SMA. My test (same settings) closed off the trades and opened a short, yet the tickmill test is keeping the longs open. edit: tickmill account closed trades at -100. My test also had max loss at -100 but closed trades at break below SMA. Could this be a bug? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Tarwada, add semi-auto mode please. When first init order is manual. Thank You!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
anyone having the same problem ? , it works fine for me....

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Is the EA supposed to close all longs and enter short once there has been a break below SMA, despite not reaching max loss? Or are long trades only closed once max loss is reached despite break below SMA? Im using exact same set file. Unsure of why the difference. Ive had no issue taking profit at +100. Fortunately in this case it looks like it saved me demo money and provided a better short entry compared to the tickmill test. Up until now (last week) my test has been running basically identically.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
the new update will include the following features : 1- one trade with add ons per trend direction Trigger (True/False) : when set to true : this feature will open buy if close above 34 SMA. but if the trades were closed due stop loss or take profit limit , it will not open any further trades in the same direction until the trend direction Change to sell (which close below 34 SMA) 2- the add-ons trades will be limited to 10 trades in maximum. and you have the ability to input each add-on tarde lot size &amp; magic number in case if you want to risk more 3- due the feature number 2. now you're able to run the EA on multi charts but remember to set different magic numbers on each chart 4- capital protection : when set to 100 for example, the EA will not take any further trades if your balance is 100.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
No any problem here for close when break SMA... please could you tell us if are you working for an update? Yeahhhh i can't wait Thanks Regards https://gyazo.com/9fe062f53268787418e3841c8637c77e

--- 帖子 #278 ---
yes it will close the trades once opposite trend occur. even if the profit/loss did not reach 100/-100

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi tarwada. Here is a screenshot from your account http://i68.tinypic.com/2nvb3oh.png Seems instead you have the same problem (like me) it doesn't close on opposite...or am i wrong?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
what is the period + MA method you're applying to the chart ?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
dude , you're using 34 SMMA not SMA as Drealliner suggested SMMA = Smoothed Moving Average SMA = Simple Moving Average

--- 帖子 #282 ---
OMG!!!! Thank you my friend, you're right!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks Tarwada, That is what I thought was meant to occur. My test did this correctly and closed longs upon break of 34 SMA. However your tickmill account in the screenshot I posted did not and left longs open despite break below 34 SMA until -100 was reached.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Could you add this important rule about re-entries please? They should never be at a price better than our last entry.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
i need more time to apply such rule hold on atm

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Version 2.5 is out !. checkout the first post !!! [+] You Can Run The EA on Multiple Charts ! (don't forget to use unique magic number on each chart !!) *New* [+] one entry with add ons per trend direction change Trigger (True/False) : *New* when set to true : this feature will open buy if close above 34 SMA. but if the trades were closed due stop loss or take profit limit , it will not open any further trades in the same trend direction until the trend direction Change to sell (which close below 34 SMA) [+] Capital Protection Trigger (True/False) + Capital Protection Amount input *New* when set to true and the current account Equity is lower than the Capital Protection Amount input : the EA will Close all the trades in all charts and will not open any further trades until protection Disabled or EA Removed

--- 帖子 #287 ---
hi Tarwada, are you still forward testing, can you put up a trade explorer linked to the thread if you have so we can see your results. I saw that you had doubled account back in the thread somwhere are the results still good? When I try and add a trade explorer to this investor account it says that it is already being used on a trade explorer. Thanks, Spencer

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hy and thanks for update...Just before start to test... if i want to use it for multipair i've to change all magic numbers for each charts? Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #289 ---
yes , change all magic numbers im running Beta Test for this EA (v2.0) Broker :TickMill Login:2089050424 Investor password: anc7klo

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I see see a trade explorer is attached to this account already, can you share it so we can monitor its performence through this?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
i don't know who made the trade explorer actually... go to account history , right click , show all history then save it as detailed report

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Tarwada, Can you make the option to set the moving average type so we can play around with them? Cheers

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi tarwada, can you please tell why the ea has taken 2 trades? max trades is set to 1.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
set the first add on trade to 0.02 and check if the extra trade produced by add on #1, do the same process for the rest and tell me which add on caused the problem . anyway, you can set all the add on trades to 0.00 to avoid any unwanted trades

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Dear Tarwada Thanks for this beautiful EA I have few observations: 1. I set TP in money 10$ and it closed in profit. But I was expecting it should repeat trade in next candle. Can u make it once it closed in profit or loss set by user it should repeat means start cycle again as per setting. 2. Some times it is is not talking order though maximum order set to 11 and candle is also in favor. Please chk.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
set (one entry per direction) to (false) , when set to false, the EA will do what you want . for the problem number 2 , please show me chart example and I'll do my best. thanks

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Thanks Tarwada I am setting one entry per direction to false and maximum trade i set to 5 and profit target set ton 5$ . Let me see how is going.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
problem solved ?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Great Update! Thanks Tarwada Now BT has show that the EA is profitable! I just think we need to how to use it properly such as how to turn off when the trend is sideway and turn on when the trend is down/up.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
im glad to hear that, can you please share your results + settings ?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Oh my goodness ! Dude, if you can resolve this crucial question you'll be a millionaire soon !

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thanks tarwada... the problem is solved after setting all add on to 0.00. but can you please tell why the ea has closed the buy trade while the price is still above MA? I have no extra settings turned on. Thanks for this awesome EA.....

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Sorry here is the pic...

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks. Problem solved. Now EA working fine.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
You're right ...crucial question

--- 帖子 #306 ---
hi tarwada, i am new in your thread. please is it possible for you to send us the set files as the one you have in the demo account? if yes, i send you my email address already. i am grateful.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
show me the logs under (journal) or (experts) the test im running with version 2.0 , the settings are (exit when profits 100 and exit when losses -100 and no max trades)., be careful and don't run it on real money account yet

--- 帖子 #308 ---
here you go...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
oh no , im using my smartphone. take a screen shot when the order was closed

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi tarwada, so can i run the new 2.5 on different charts/different pairs without closing the positions of the other EAs when TP or SL is reached?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
yes but don't forget to use different magic numbers on each chart

--- 帖子 #312 ---
​Hi Tarwada, Could you help tell me what to set in "Magic number setting " Its mean, We have to set its Pairs with different number ?? Like EURUSD magic number 123; USDJPY magic number 234ect, and the Trailing Stop how to set it number ? Trailing stop Activation ?? I do set Trailing stop 1; Trailing stop activation around 35-40 do its right or how ?? Thank Tarwada

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Thanks very much. Will continue monitoring it

--- 帖子 #314 ---
yes use completely different magic numbers on each chart..... Trailing Stop = how far the stop (by pips) will be away from the current price..... Trailing Stop Activation = when to active the trailing stop. for example : when you set the Trailing Stop to 10 and Trailing Stop Activation to 20 the stop loss will be under/above the current price by 10 pips only if you're already 20 pips in profit. otherwise the Trailing Stop will not be Activated i Hope it's clear now

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi tarwada! Thank you for your work, very impressive. I think this indicator can help to some extent in determining the trend. It would be very nice if you find it useful in the EA.

Hi guys in order to try to give a contribute, without degenerate the EA nature which works perfect for me in long term view, i attach an indicator for exit strategy. The exits are for me the worst nightmare for every system, expecially for this. Attached File(s) ATRprojections.ex4 7 KB | 592 downloads It's a simple indicator which shows 3 profit levels for both buy and sell position. As you can see the price often goes towards the 3rd level, then it comes back or it goes over. On every bar opening it calculates the new levels if the price has passed over. Attached Image (click to enlarge) the price touches all 3 levels, then retrace. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Only 1st and 2nd for now... Attached Image (click to enlarge) BTW seems he wants to go over Another example where all 3 up levels are reached. Then got back for sell and the first two are already hit! (just to know the distance between 2nd up and 2nd down is 97 pips) Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the good old tarwada thinks it worth give a try as an alternative for TP in his EA, here is the chance!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Here it is..

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yes is a great indicator for me also!!! It worth a try my friends!! And I don't think it repaint. It only show where the bars are under/over 0.5, then why it needs to repaint? Anyway i'm not sure yet...

--- 帖子 #329 ---
sanmiguell: Hi, The real test is to answer what does the indicator REALLY show at that moment where on the chart it seems to display a good change in price direction. In other words look at your chart. and then look at the instance where it showed the change of direction. Now did it actually do that at that moment? Or did the indicator show nothing at that moment only to have it show the change several bars later. Which is what we see now this is trading... and this is what we know..

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Tarwada: Please know that I am available to help with the code. One way to avoid all the confusion of the "magic number" is to use the ChartID() as the magic number. Each chart when you open it creates it's own individual ID. So when the EA starts up, you can just set the magic number = ChartID() and voala ther you have it. Let the code do that stuff for them. You can then set the magic number variable to be global or u can always use ChartID() again so u can then use that when comparing it to OrderMagicNumber(). To verify this just add a Print(Symbol)+": ChartID = "+ChartID()) statement in the init() function. Then run the EA on several charts and you will see the print out of the ChartID number for each chart in the Experts tab. you will see that the number printed is different and unique for each chart. If you really want to get fancy. You can use random generation code and create a magic number for EACH TRADE LOL . If you need help in keeping track of stacking trades, MM approaches, BE conditions etc etc etc. Let me know I got a lot of functions that cover all kinds of stuff. As soon as I am done with my current EA project I am coming over to play with this EA and the HFT approach. Keep it going, you guys don't know it yet but you are very close to a profitable approach...

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi xmess! Unfortunately it REPAINTS BADLY!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) I ran a strategy tester on m1 and you can see it repaints over 53 bars back...I really don't know why needs to repaint since he has the only work to measure the moving average degrees!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hey Sam: LOl you beat me to it. I was going to test it myself cause I was interested in using it on the Ea I am working on. I'll double check and I'll see if anything can be done with the code to improve it's detection.. thnx Jess

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Try this one... non repaint.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Here is another indicator to detect trending and ranging market...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Sam: I figured out why the indicator repaints. It has to do with what is called a loop. Think of it this way. Say you are the indicator and every 15 minutes u get say 20 candles. You then place them in order from newest to oldest and for each u calculate an MA average (u LOOP thru each, so your LOOP=20). Then comes a new candle, you place it on the table in the order from new to old. U get rid of the oldest candle (#21 now) cause u can only have 20 on the table. Again u calculate the MA for each candle. But this time you see that the MA value for the candle has changed on some of them. Say that the new candle is #1. So you compare candle #2 with the MA u got before. It's different and u also see the MA values for say candles #3-7 are also different than what u just calculated before the new candle. Why are they different? Cause as time goes on the MA is starting to form it's shape as we see it looking back in time. So this is what the indicator does too. However before before it does what I explained in paragraph above. It will 1st loop thru around 4000 candles in one swoop and since the MAs are already locked in place it calculates the MAs with no change to them and that is what u see plotted on the chart. It looks so nice, doesn't it? . After that 1st 4000 candle loop the indicator then loops for about 2+eintPeriod candles . Since eintPeriod=56 it loops for 58 candles. Hey u can actually change that in the inputs... Got it? So u see it's the looping. Or the way the indicator calculates the MAs as it loops thru those 58 candles at each tick. One way to attack this would be to calculate the MA angles only if the MAs are SET and at the close of the candles instead every tick. Hmmm.. LOL I am going to try that LOL...... I'll let you know what happens.... I don't know when I'll do it cause I am busy with the other EA, but I will do it soon. Take care... Jess

--- 帖子 #336 ---
hello and welcome to my thread. thank you dude and i will ask you for help as soon as i need and thank you again for believing in this EA and good luck in your work ! wish you the best ! &lt;3 btw the indicator uploaded by Nibiru repaint like hell but thank you guys for keeping the things up &lt;3

--- 帖子 #337 ---
First of all thanks a lot tarwada for this EA, looks very promising sofar. I do have a question though, just 8 minutes ago, the EA on your account opened another position as by the rules. However on my account no position was opened. Is there any way to find out why? Max trades is set to 11, so that shouldn't be the issue. Thanks

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Great xmess!!! Great explanation! I'll wait for any news from you...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Dear Tarwada I am using Fidilies capital broker and working fine But when i used in in Insta forex it closed all other open positions. why? can you chk

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Strangely the EA opened a trade at 11:00 but then again did not open another trade at 12:00... Which means I missed out on the 10:00 and 12:00 trades which all have been opened on your demo account. I am running version 2.5 and max trades is set to 11, so I don't know what could have caused that?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
then the broker is the problem. be careful insta forex banned my account for no reason and they're not replying to my emails (1000$ live account)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
hi fsm: To verify that the EA is doing it's job you can also check it against the conditions as established by the originator (Dreamliner). I haven't kept up with this thread but if the approach has not been super modified for the EA you should be able to place the 34sma and see for yourself if the trades should or should not been taken. This way you can provide tarwada a chart that shows where the trades were missed and how they did not match the conditions etc etc. This would help tarwada to nail down what he has to test or figure out why that happened as so. It's all part of debuging

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I've same problem sometimes Ea open two order in the same open candle ....wht's wrong? Regards

I think this is of tarwada's SMA has other period than 34

--- 帖子 #362 ---
tarwada on the demo account you are running HFT v2.5 or 2.0? And thanks for your work Maybe..i was thinking the same thing..Maybe 45 or 46

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Tarwada said he is running version 2.0. this is exactly what i am also running and i asked him to set the robot for me which he did. i can see here that the sma is 34. the 2 last trades open in his account at 15:00 and 16:00 are also open in my demo account with tickmill . so basically my account and tarwada account are now having same trades.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I also have the trades at 15 and 16 .. so right now you have 8 open trades?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
It's strange because we see that orders were not closed when the price was below 34 SMA, but the candle on his chart closed below SMA clearly. May be tarwada comment on this.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
oh thank you. i was afraid that im doing something different from what you're all doing and finally found someone that agrees with me and yes , i logged in to his VPS and set up everything to him good luck all reminder : the test on tickmill is using version 2.0 with the following settings : 34 SMA no max trades all lots 0.01 (including add-ons) Exit When profits 100 Exit When Losses -100 H1 Chart GBP/JPY Broker : TickMill Login: 2089050424 Investor password : anc7klo yea i don't know actually what is the problem , when i backtest the same date it closes the trades , but when i run it live , i see this problem

yea 34

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Tarwada, did You have the trade contest busy error on tickmill? I googled it and it seems there are solutions in ea code, I dont know. But I have it on both FXCM and Tickmill. What I can see it depends on EA sending to many orders at one time to brooker. Maybee there are solutions. About FXCM, I have several FXCM demos with different EA´s without this error. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Just now my IC demo had the same problem when trying to close my trades with $1000 profit. Something must be wrong I guess.

when we finish this project successfully, I'll Create a ZuluTrade Account then you can follow me for free. this may help those members who don't know how to set up a VPS or they're having other problems

Perfect...this is a winner Just let us know when You do that update, I will go live. One another solution would be to have a trade copier, but then we must find a brooker thats always works, what I can see not FXCM, IC, or Tickmill works, they have this problem

Tickmill works good for me atm. but I'll consider Pepperstone or XM as they're very very honest brokers

Dear you are doing an excellent Job. I have never used the Aroon Up Down Indicator but I am working on my own version of Top Down Indicator. Do give it a try on Basket Trades. And keep big pockets for saving pips and have a big heart for loosing big. But most of the times , you will win. Although I put a different version of HTF strategy on my VPS. A week ago, i was having almost 100% up on demo. But failed to take care of my basket since a week and everything BOOOOM. Basically MA's are just simple averages. Does not make too much sense when looking from abstract but forex is special field where things get meaning if too many people using it. I think almost all people using MA's. My entry is Price rejection from EMA 21 and EMA 50 with nolag having color in favor of entry. But nolag causing too many early exits. So i will do something of it this week. Do consult Maria regarding exit, she has a killing instinct when to exit.

Tried this EA for the first time today and only with small lots (0.3). The EA detected 4 trades, 2 in 1H TF and 2 in 4H TF. All four won with £20 each (That is my TP which I set myself. I will try it on Monday for a whole day and will update you guys how it goes. So far I am very pleased.

Hello. This EA I have now tried a few days. 1 hour timeframe. GBPJPY The trades also run in the right direction, but are closed in negative territory later. I use the published SET file. However, something seems to be wrong with the settings. My broker is Admiral Markets. What are the settings to show off to the S / L and T S / L? Just breakeven etc. Thank you so much!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
i just observed that all the trades in my demo account close and 1 sell order open. It is contrary to what Tawarda has in his demo account. The behavior of the robot is not the same.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
hello, I have seen that GBPJPY in the account provided is closed just now below 34 and it doesn't close order but rather than open a buy order again. Could please explain. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Im assuming Tarwada is manually intervening. This situation has been bought up a few times now with no reply. That or hes running a slightly modified version of the EA that only closes the trades once max loss has been reached, despite break below 34 SMA

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi all. I'm newbie for this thread. Thanks to tarwada. I tried the EA since Monday market opening but EA closed all positions and opened a new one for sell at this morning but tarwada's beta testing on Tickmill didnt closed like pictures. I dont' know why, set file is same like tarwada's.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
The last buys have been set in a region of strong resistance (go back via weekly charts even to 2009). I think running this bot handsfree you'll go up stepwise. That means after a 100 win you will loose, but the looser baskets are much smaller than 100 ... so in summary the EA may bring more winners then loosers and an overall winning account ... perhaps ?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
This is exactly the same issue i have. But I have exactly the same settings as Tarwada and the same broker. So what went wrong, i do not know.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I think the issue is with speard

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Which issue are you referring to? I have the same settings and same broker as Tarwada, but my trades close and his are still there. Not an issue with spread

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Same here, on two different brokers (Tickmill and Pepperstone ).

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I think the problem with version 2.0 is that when you load it on the chart sometimes loads with SMA and sometimes with normal MA. Trades from today where closed correctly if the EA used the simple MA. Maybe version 2.5 of the EA solves that problem.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hey tarwada ! Bro where are you man ? You see some questions here arose during your absence ....

--- 帖子 #392 ---
NO. I'm running 2.5 and i've such problem also

--- 帖子 #393 ---
tarwada's trades closed at 17:00 . According to the picture the MA is not 34. May be about 45 SMA. What do you think? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #394 ---
few posts earlier he said is using 34 for SMA... but sometimes EA seems to use simple MA not SMA

--- 帖子 #395 ---
sma = Simple Moving Average btw i really don't know why you're all having different results :/

--- 帖子 #396 ---
ما ادري ايش المشكلة ، مع اني مبرمج الاكسبيرت صح لكن المشكلة دي تسير احيان :/

--- 帖子 #397 ---
If the rule is 34 Simple Moving Average that it seems our results are true, please look at the picture at post 384. Price closed under the 34 SMA then all trades are closed and open a new one , short trade cause of price opened under the 34 SMA. But yours is different so your moving average should be different (please no offence, just an idea with my poor english) so your trades closed at 17:00 but it's not 34 Simple MA. Could you please review?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
your demo is not closing trades upon break of 34 SMA. The demo is only closing trades once they reach $100 loss. Judging from the posts above, everyone's demo closed upon break of 34 SMA except yours.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
His today loss is 85.21$ not 100$. So his Ea use a ma for breaking but it's different from 34, i think.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Just double checked. Yep $85.21 hmmmmm i'm stumped then. No idea how Tarwada's demo is determining when to close other than different sma or max loss of $85.00

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I think several trades were closed at the break of 34 SMA. Please have a look at the attached file which shows all the trades since the start and you will see that several trades were closed at a loss far less than -100$. I believe the performance of this demo account is quite amazing considering the very low start balance (200$) and the lowest lot size used. Thank you tarwada. Attached File(s) Tarwada Demo Account Report.pdf 35 KB | 872 downloads

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Yep the $100 loss theory is incorrect (my mistake). Highlighted by the fact the last examples showed a loss of -$85.00 when the trades were closed. I'm more curious as to what criteria it is using to close trades. The examples shown on the previous page demonstrated the demo still opening long trades even once the 34 SMA had been broken.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Then that's the problem.. Dreamliner method uses smooth moving average As you can see in his post here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...55#post8722155 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Yes, big difference between the two...

--- 帖子 #405 ---
This night many trades were not opened and the EA gave the following error message: 2016.03.14 22:00:27.283 HFT v2.5 GBPJPY,H1: ---VERBOSE--- 2016.03.15 00:00 Order failed, error: 132 What does that mean?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Dreamliner sad "Yes, you are correct, I was wrong. I meant simple." So it is a simple ma he means, sma If this EA works at i should, it will be greate. Mine has also missed many trades this night.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
after the trades close yesterday in loss after trend change, mine open trades that same yesterday and close in profit this morning, just as tarwada account show it.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I think good improving could be avoid Ea start new basket if we have to much distance from sma... Regards

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Yep, this EA is doing a great Job in any trend periods ... but only in trend periods ....

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Yes, it's a moving average system...what else do you expected?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hello sir, Could you please add start time and close time like start 00:01 and close at 23:59 . This will help using this EA with news and with small frames. Thanks again for this wonderful EA

--- 帖子 #412 ---
no order, order fail error 132 on tickmill , no sell on tarwadas demo

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Is the thread dead? EA just closed my all trades at 19:00 with 34 Simple MA with loss. tarwada's still working. tarwada what do you use Simple MA value? Clearly it seems that different from 34. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Same for me..

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I had again exactly the same issue. My setting was done by Tawarda and we are using the same broker. But my trades close with loss while his trades are still running. Friend Tawarda, can you help us understand the situation and how to fix it?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
he has VPS issue?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
guys I think this thread is to experiment purposes. So please try. Every EA has it Cons and Pros. Really I am amazed with the performance of this EA, although the back test showes different. Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Tarwarda, thx for your EA. I am testing it at the moment with some success. Anyhow since I updated to 2.5 it´s opening two trades at the same time on the same candle every now and then. I couldn´t figure out why so far. Anybody elsoe got these? And please forgive me if somebody allready posted about. I try to keep up with the thread, but can´t read every post at the moment. Cheers Max

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I think the question is... did anyones test close off short trades at the same position as Tarwada's demo? 34 SMA was broken at about 160.290. Tarwada's demo:

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Yep mine did. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I'm doing test with 08 pairs eur jpy, euraud, eurnzd, eurcad GBPJPY, gbpaud, gbpnzd, GBPCAD the pair crossed the SMA 34 and the EA did not make the entries ... what might be happening? I changed the magic number on the local green arrow for each pair ... correct? eurjpy 11111111 EURAUD 22222222 and I did so with 08 pairs ... Would anyone have the answer that might be happening? As was mentioned in the post 415,,, is happening this problem with me

--- 帖子 #422 ---
No. Your trades closed at 19:00 but tarwada's was at 21:00 and your result is awsome, do you use TS, Be etc? can you please add your set file? and how many pairs do you test?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
woops wrong thread...

--- 帖子 #424 ---
So here is my MFXB link of the test (demo) acoumt with v 2.0: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT...ada-h1/1555566

--- 帖子 #425 ---
My EA v2.5 missed a short entry at 12:00 tickmill time (tarwada instead got this). Now it'd have to open a buy at 16:00 instead of 17:00.... Maybe the problem is it doesn't close at the end of the "crossover" candle, but at the opening of the next ! My three short trades of today ( instead of 4! ) closed at: 16:00 16:01 16:01 Perhaps, for this matter, the EA read that candle as "busied" and for this it waits to open at the next one. The close and reverse function doesn't work properly at my side.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
The operations are being closed each hour,,, what can I do for entries give continuity and not closed?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
At least 1 second after...For this you miss a candle! 1 second for this system could be a century

--- 帖子 #428 ---
??????????????????? I did not understand I'm using 2.0 HFT what to do to operations not close. The account tarwada operations have continuity and do not close ... how is your set? something is different, and not open new operations close those that are open.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi tarwada. Thanks for this. Using it just it live on USD CAD H4. Just one thing some of the settings are confusing especially if we want to use it on multiple charts like Majic numbers, Break even, &amp; stops. Can you do a quick video on this?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hahahahah Brother Tharwada, How much you are being paid per month. hahah

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi Tarwada, First of all, I appreciate your hard work of coding this EA, which in my opinion a lot of effort has been devoted to it. Looking at the EA, and especially the input settings, I, as an experienced coder, can see a large space of optimization to the code for speed and probably a better performance of trading. I didn't start coding this strategy mostly because I saw this EA was already developed, and that the back test results are not that much good. However, if you or somebody else has a promising forward test of a month or more, I would like to take a look at the results. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #432 ---
@Math Ok, look my MFXB link above in post #424: I let this account running untouched during the next weeks !

Thanks! Looks promising!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
you run it 24hours ? amazing result man !

--- 帖子 #436 ---
....

--- 帖子 #437 ---
yeah, it is clear now that we are not all having the same results.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
we are not with the same results as EA is closing positions. The entry should only close if: 1) If the other side of SMA 34 2) If for STOP 3) Closing manually The inputs are being closed and then when you close another H1 candle, open it again. Would anyone like to say something.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
The only person that can help clarify the issue is Tarwada. Hope he will provide us with some insight.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I see what is happening with other friends. At the time the account is tarwada 10 GBPJPY entries. My account I put 08 pairs and no pair gets more than 02 entries, all the time that closes an H1 candle, EA closes positions and not open another, as well as EA tarwada account.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I am trading only 1 pair GBPJPY. EA v2.0 with the same settings as Tawarda. But different result.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hello i have loaded the HFT v2.0 and loaded the v2.0 set file, but al trades in my tester gbpjpy 1H, i get all in loss? Thats wrong, i get same results as cjtylors picture http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1456925098

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Friend these last 03 days,,, GBPJPY was going up and down the SMA 34..por it was prejudice ... the long run you will have better results. One thing I noticed,, believe that $ 100 TP is very ... while the couple does not give a good race will not have profit,,, as $ 100 with lot 0.01 are roughly 1000 pips roughly. We can do tests with 20/30 dollars per pair Tp, as even the closing operation and being in the direction of sma 34,, will continue to open operation for

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Yes better go with 50-100 pips per basket. 1000 can be reached only when GBPJPY is trending.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Its not 1000 pips for TP. We add positions with every candle that close opposite trend, as Dreamliner sad. It´s exponentiell wins and linear losses. But EA does not work as Dreamliner says, first buy/sell position is the second candle after break of sma34, the first is only close of old positions. Also, EA does not buy/sell on every retrace. And not always close when it should. But look at what this EA have done in one month on his Tickmill demo!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I changed broker from TradersWay to RoboForex in my strategy tester and changed the profit to 5 usd instead, and it works very good. I don´t know what was wrong in the TradersWay tester.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I will post it when it´d prooving good. I use BE and TS but they´re guesswork. By the way GJ only.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
oh my god. i just came back from a vacation and i found out the reason behind having different results than mine. first of all please guys accept my apology for making such coconfusion. i am coding 2 version of the HFT EA , 1 version on my desktop (which the version that im uploading here) and the other one coded on my VPS which the version that im testing with tickmill. there's only one different between them. the version that I've uploaded here trades when close above/below 34 SMA. BUT the version on my test trades long when close above 34 SMA applied to low and trades short when close below 34 SMA applied to High. that is the different !. i really feel dumbass for forgetting such thing. I'll make a hot update for you then you can have the exact same results with my test guaranteed 100%. !

--- 帖子 #449 ---
All my orders closed with the closing of this last candle H1. Friends while EA is closing time for entries in time, we will not get the same results Tarwada. Unfortunately no one here gives an answer. I believe that not resolving, this topic will miss the meaning. The tarwada account is 15 GBPJPY entries, EA was not to close the entries as price remains above 34 SMA and has not been for TP. I hope that a friend can answer this problem.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
oh man look who's here. math7. wait for the next update as im going to fix a lot of things, thank you for reviewing my EA i clarified everything above. double Read please. btw im running H1 not M15 TF

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Thanks for clarification tarwada. I remember that your message on http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...73#post8744773 Buy when : price close above 34 SMA Applied to LOW , Not Close Close Buy positions when : Price Close Below 34 SMA applied to HIGH not to LOW or CLOSE Sell when : price Close Below 34 SMA applied to HIGH , Not Close Close Sell positions when : Price Close Above 34 SMA applied to Low not to High or CLOSE

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Many thanks for the reply. I not put M15 TF. You are in H1 JUST SAID THAT IN YOUR MIND WE HAVE 15 INPUTS GBPJPY I WILL WAIT FOR UPDATES A GREAT WEEKEND

--- 帖子 #453 ---
yea yea exactly. thank you. I've been looking for this post. thanks

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hello traders! This is my first post here. This post is for tarwada (or anyone else who understands): I've been trying to open your EA version 2.0 in MT4 for a demo account with OANDA without success. I was able to load a Renko chart EA successfully on the MT4. The Renko EA had a file extension of ".MQ4" and the others that show up free in the Expert Advisor have the same extension. I believe the HFT EA v.2.0 is not compatible with the version of MT4 provided for my demo account by OANDA due to its ".ex4" file extension. If I am wrong, can someone guide me in the right direction to figure out how to get my MT4 to load it? If I am right, can someone convert the ".ex4" file to ".MQ4". I'm pretty sure it will load if it is a ".MQ4" file. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Presumably you are in the wrong thread ? No Renko is needed here !

--- 帖子 #456 ---
This is how I am starting this week. AUD-- Bearish CHF-Bullish CAD-Bearish GBP-Strongly Bullish JPY-Bearish NZD-Bearish USD-Bearish Let's see what happen

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I understand that this thread isn't about Renko, DerBerliner. I was just describing the nature of the difficulty I am having trying to get MT4 to load tarwada's HFT software, in that I was able to load the Renko EA I have to MT4, which has a file extension of mq4, but have not able to load tarwada's HFT v2.0, which has a file extension of ex4. My speculation being that I'm either doing it wrong or the version of MT4 I'm using only supports EAs with a file extension of mq4.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I'm running now the v 2.0 and the v 2.5 as well. https://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT...ada-h1/1555566 https://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT...ada-h1/1560142 (The platform with v 2.5 has actually some older results of a former EA ... will switch the start time of MFXB Analysis later on)

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi Sajj, This is something interesting...I do analysis every week....Not competing nor insulting you but i wanted to write my views and lets see how it works... AUD - Daily - Bearish, Weekly - Bullish, Monthly - Bullish = Overall Bullish CHF - Daily - Bullish, Weekly - Bullish, Monthly - Neutral = Overall Bullish CAD - Daily - Bearish, Weekly - Strong Bullish, Monthly - Neutral = ? GBP - Daily - Bullish, Weekly - Bearish, Monthly - Neutral = ? JPY - Daily Bearish, Weekly - Neutral (Seems bullish over and started weakening), Monthly - Strong Bullish = Bullish NZD - Daily Bearish, Weekly - Neutral, Monthly - Neutral = Bearish USD - Daily Bearish, Weekly - Bearish, Monthly - Bearish, = Bearish EUR - Daily Bullish, Weekly - Neutral, Monthly - Bullish = Bullish lets see how it goes...Yet i havent done fundamental because i am missing some information so waiting for it thanks

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Brother believe me, I love it. I don't extend my analysis to Monthly because it will then require me to set a high SL. I do my analysis on daily and H4. When there is some confusion, I use weekly for deciding the match. Still the market going the way, i predicted if you see the charts. GBP is still to show the Bullish bias. I have already went long on EUR and Short on CHF pairs. Almost 120 pips up till now. Waiting for GBP to turn in my favor. And make an entry. I donot include fundamentals in my initial but i do look for its impacts and waiting for the impacts to appear on chart . My brother , my above comment is just a short summary of what i am expecting next few days. I have skipped my pair by pair analysis.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I am stepped out of EUR and CHF with a small loss.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Please where is Tawarda? Has this thread change to manual trading???

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thats good...this helps each other... I do pair to pair analysis too for the week and accordingly i enter the trade...so far today i have banked 125 pips and one more trade running 57 pip positive... nice to meet you... regards

--- 帖子 #464 ---
hi shg, please do you use any special indicator for your analysis?

--- 帖子 #465 ---
After 3 weeks of testing i got these performances: trades 127 pips gained 1.354,5 win 40% profit factor 1,43 entry accuracy 54,57% This system is great for long term trading. No matter if the win % is low. This system gains much more pips than losses because, soon or later, there will be a good trend and the trend is always bigger than ranging! BTW there is a problem, let me continue... exit accuracy 46,19% pips missed 4773,5 Pips missed means: SUM [high in pips reached from every trade - pips gained (or loosed)] As you can see more than 3.5 times of pips gained!!! There is an exit problem. Too many pips left in the market! Maybe the close and reverse exit is too late. Maybe a fixed basket TP of 1000 pips is too much or too thin. Perhaps an ATR exit based would be better..I really don't know. I only know 2 things: 1) this is a great system in a long term. This is the holy grail if you can wait...After months you are sure you'll gain! 2) i don't want to burn so many pips, so a better exit way is necessary I hope we together can find something to improve this EA.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi Lanzo, no not particularly but what i suggest you incase if you want to do analysis then use your system and read them carefully...if you doubt or not clear for anything then take it as a neutral in your analysis... thanks

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I want to present my view also. 1. Exit Issue : Perhaps the exit with candle close above SMA-34 is too strict and too early. It can generate too many SL hits. Exit with risk reward ratio and Color Change DO can be two good exit options. 2. Since this technique is fully Open to loose trade in a continuous streak. Once you obtained a good entry, it means you are in trend. Now its times to get the full Pips that may possibly be available. So always keep a High Risk Reward Ratio (5 to 10) . And also use NoLagDot color change is an emergency in case the trade reversing on before hitting your Risk Reward ratio. And a third exit Option may be 50% of previous trend. you should identify the Previous High or Low. Mark your turning points. Immediately set everything to B.E once on a turning points(this mostly happen lower lows, Higher Highs or on somewhere arround a random number). If you cannot use a high Risk Reward then this method is not suitable(high risk reward will reduce the missing pips). (3) I found it more strong on baskets rather single pair. I am testing a slight modified version of this method but the main theme is same. Soon i am thinking to include Support/Resistance. This may reduce SL hit streak.

See tarries not put the correct EA, the topic will end ... because EA has to be like EA Account in VPS

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Dear Tawarda, Thank you so very much for sharing such a great idea to trade on any moving average with this EA. Really its a great gift for every trader if they really think... but it really mater for me. I just review your EA from the past one week on your forward testing tickmill account and I understood the logic of this EA properly. Now I want to apply v2.5 in demo account for forward testing on different profit target, so I have a question please:- 1- If Trailing_Stop = 40 Does it mean 4 pips away from the current price or 40 pips away from the current price ? 2- If Trailing_Stop_Activation = 40 Does it mean it will active after 40 pips from the trade price or 04 pips from the trade price ? This is the confusion. So please explain in detail if you can. Thank you for understanding. I am waiting for your answer.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Can someone please help out a newbie. I need to know how to load tarwada's ex4 files into mt4. If it cannot be done, I need to know how convert it to mq4. Anyone?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Good results is a BIG word....because of ranging market. BTW i'm testing on GBPJPY and GBPCHF both on TF H1. The results were nice, but as i told, we need an exit strategy in order to get more pips (left in the market otherwise)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I'm not sure, but i remember i used it once and 40 stay for 4 pips. The settings are in point. BUT please make a try. Set it to 40 and launch the EA. At the first order you'll see (if in profit) the trailing distance from the price: if 4 or 40 pips

--- 帖子 #478 ---
In your MT4 click on File-&gt;open data folder. Click on MQL4-&gt;Experts and paste the ex4 file inside. Restart your platfrom and attach it to a chart. Forget the .mql extension. You only need the .ex4 to work. The .mql is for change the source code.

Â Can you please share that file of EA that you are coding on your VPS and applied on your tickmill demo account. Because these files are not working properly as compair to your demo account.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Who knows what his (Tawarda) setup on a demo account ?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
@sanmiguell: I think that may have worked. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi T arwada , I would also apriciate if you could share the version of the EA coded on your VPS. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Interesting idea. I've started an optimization BT to find the best SET and the best way to go with this EA. My first impression, we may get issues with spreads , brokers, order execution (speed) and market news. Going with 2.0 and 2.5 default settings I saw the results far way from good results, I mean, not profits. Hope I'll be able to find a good SET and then try FT. Regards,

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Unfortunately, it is not the same EA is in the VPS account with what is here in the post 01

--- 帖子 #485 ---
tarwada thanks for your generosity of sharing your EAs. Since you are open to suggestions to improve the EAs, would it be possible to: 1. Replace the MA with the nonlagdot indicator as an entry trigger as it catches trends earlier. 2. Use the previous swing high/ swing low to automatically calculate the SL and position size according to risk setting. 3. Remove the limit on the max number of add-on trades and have the option of these as a certain multiple of the initial entry e.g. 1.0 is same as initial and 0.5 is half as initial. Thanks again and keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
What a pity ! It seems tarwada is actually gone ?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
yes, it seems to be

--- 帖子 #488 ---
No, he may be busy on doing other things. he will definitely come to us.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
and here i am. but guess what ? ..... I'll share the exact same EA on my VPS today (probably after 4 hours from now).... stay tuned Traders !!! yea I've explained that in this post ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...66#post8823866 )

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Yes i can't wait... And I've seen in your account today same problem with double order could you check it. Thanks for effort Regards

--- 帖子 #491 ---
what do you mean by double order problem ?. im currently monitoring 4 EA's that im willing to share.... for free ofc. so it's a little bit hard for me to check every single entry.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
now you can have the same exact results as my demo account with version 3.0 Version 3.0 is Preconfigured ! Set &amp; Forget JUMP TO THE FIRST POST to know why you all had a different results , please refer to this post

--- 帖子 #493 ---
thank you alot

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Tarwada thx for the recent update, please keep up the good work ! I know you are not very concerned about back testing, but do you know why it runs so slowly in the strategy tester ? it is taking 1+ hour to cover just 2 months of data, which for a single SMA invocation per tick sounds a bit too much time consuming

--- 帖子 #495 ---
backtest will slow down when there's an open position and i don't know why

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Dear Tarwada, Thank you very much for sharing your own EA using on your VPS. I will start testing it my self with my own settings, I will let you know the result of the same in near future. I hope you are working sound on other EAs as well Best of Luck Man.... Regards

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Tarwada, May I make a suggestion for your EA? Could you make an (option on/off) to make a TP with a 3 candle trailing stop? I don't know how difficult it would be to implement but I think that there would be more pip gain using this method rather than closing on the 34 SMA. I know it is not the original Dreamliner method and this is why I am asking it to be optional rather than hardwired. Many Thanks &amp; Best Regards, Daniel

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hi Is this rules Ok?!? Enter Long When the Price Closes Above 34 SMA applied to low Enter Short When Price Closes Below 34 SMA applied to high In many times Price Closes above "34 SMA applied to low" and below "34 SMA applied to high" at the same time!!! So EA will open buy and sell orders together. Besides I checked the New EA, and it is not same as the one on your demo account too. tnx.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
According to the different results, how did you figured that ?. don't rely on backtests please

--- 帖子 #500 ---
New EA Test (unnamed , still beta) on TickMill - Login:2089076157 - Investor password:8vgwhln (from 200$ to 305$ (+50%) in less than 2 days. stay tuned!)

--- 帖子 #501 ---
No I have forward testing today and opening and closing orders are different from your demo account. please reconsider these rules again. it seems incorrect: Enter Long When the Price Closes Above 34 SMA applied to low Enter Short When Price Closes Below 34 SMA applied to high

--- 帖子 #502 ---
sure.... im confused now ....

--- 帖子 #503 ---
it would make more sense to SELL when High[1] &lt; MA_LOW BUY when Low[1] &gt; MA_HIGH my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I think I know what he's trying to say... If you are using bar high to buy and bar low to sell and that a bar is crossing the 34 SMA, would it not open both a buy and a sell? I'm no expert at this, I think this is what he's getting at. BTW: I am testing the EA v3.0 with original trade method, no TP or SL. I am looking forward to see results. Thanks for coding this EA! Cheers! Daniel

--- 帖子 #505 ---
tarwada Thank you for sharing the magnificent (HFT) and keep up the Tarwada job . thanks again .

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Dear Tarwada, Thats great Good Work and keep it up. I will also have an eyes on this account too Keep in touch. Regards

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Dear Tarwada, If you are going to add some more features so please let me also participate in the race Note down two more options give below:- 1- INPUT: Timing of EA if some one wants to use it on Specific Time of the day set it true/false 2- INPUT: Give the targeted profit to EA once the respective target met do not open any more trade in the account until we deattache the EA and attach it again. For Example: I have 1000$ Equity and today my target is 100$, Now EA start trading. Once my equity reached 1100$ EA will no more open any trade for today or until I start EA again. I hope you got my point. May be I will suggest more options in near future. Regards

--- 帖子 #508 ---
ok, i will add these features next update thank you for keeping things up

--- 帖子 #509 ---
your new creation is quite wicked, going good so far. congrats to your new baby. keep it up

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Keep up the very good job you are doing it ! thank you for sharing this amaizing EA Cheers!

Hi you Tickmill demo account and you post EA V3.5 is taking different position in same broker&gt; I am testing it in my demo account its closed all position while in you demo account 2089050424 is still open position so make sure you will rectify soon Thankx

[quote=praful_patat;8845318]Hi you Tickmill demo account and you post EA V3.5 is taking different position in same broker&gt; I am testing it in my demo account its closed all position while in you demo account 2089050424 is still open position so make sure you will rectify soon Thankx[/quote Same thing happened with version 3.0 all trades closed on my Pepperstone demo account but not on 2089076058 account Tickmill

--- 帖子 #513 ---
for me the posted version 3.0 also does not trade identical to tarwadas demo. i run it some broker = tickmill gj on 1hour timeframe. something is not right in the posted version.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Dear Tarwada, The EA v3.0 did some interesting thing. When direction change it open a trade into the old direction and immediately close it. This is the screenshot, I plotted with red x to the bad trades:

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Agree

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I don't know why people are complaining about this EA. It does exactly what it's suppose to do. The best settings I have found so far is to leave it running with no SL or TP, put all the trade closing options to false and let trades open and close according to the original HFT rules. Other than this, there is not much else to test other than maybe trying a different SMA period and try it on all pairs. Although I am looking at ways to minimize losses in the ranging and flat SMA periods, I am completely satisfied for what the EA does. It trades the HFT system. I hope to maybe make my own version of the EA at some point as I do not want to bug Tarwada for this. The strategy is simple enough for anybody to program in fxdrema. Cheers! Daniel PS: RESULTS WILL VARY AS YOU ARE ON A 4H CHART AND 4H CANDLES ARE NOT THE SAME WITH ALL BROKERS BECAUSE OF THE TIME ZONE DIFFERENCES OF THE BROKERS

--- 帖子 #517 ---
daniel, i sure was not complaining at all, just pointing out that 3.0 does not trade exactly like his demo. not even close. and that is same broker platform running h1. with h4 bars you are correct they differ from broker to broker.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I was just stating a fact And i am fully aware of 4 hr candles timezone differences

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Dear Tarwada, Thank you very much for considering Please have a look on the given example again before editing in your EA. I made a little change. 2- INPUT: Give the targeted profit to EA once the respective target met do not open any more trade in the account until we deattache the EA and attach it again. For Example: I have 1000$ Equity now I have TWO targets i.e 100$ or -100$ , Now EA start trading. Once my equity reached 1100$ or -900$ EA will no more open any trade for today or until I start EA again. Regards

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Dear Tarwada, I have a question please.......... When we apply EA on the graph with Simple Moving Average (SMA) by default it is apply to "Close" but we can apply it to "High" as well if we want. My question is weather your EA will read only apply to "Close" or it will also read to "High" as well on the chart. Because in EA input option there is only SMA_Period. doesn't mentioned apply to "close" or "High" Please explain it in detail if there is any...... Regards

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Definitely... also new 3.0 or 3.5 version are not the same as Tarwada.... It's really a pitty that this Ea is abbandoned... Regards

--- 帖子 #522 ---
you do not need the EA,if you trade just 1 pair, you can have more control to exit using your your own criteria. next chart show a trade 15m with 34 SMA

--- 帖子 #523 ---
5 M

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Yes you are agree but i think could really be better have a simple Ea to help us to apply this for different pairs.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Dear Tarwada, I got the answer of my question EA is not working on Simple Moving Average SMA Apply to "High" It is only working on Simple Moving Average SMA Apply to "Close" Only. Now you are kindly requested to add the parameters for SMA Apply to Condition if we want to use it on "Close" or "High". Actually the result on "High" is best as compare to "Close". Please consider this one too. Now from my side there are in total Three Additions. Previous Two are Kindly Below:- 1- INPUT: Timing of EA if some one wants to use it on Specific Time of the day set it true/false 2- INPUT: Give the targeted profit to EA once the respective target met do not open any more trade in the account until we deattache the EA and attach it again. For Example: I have 1000$ Equity now I have TWO targets i.e 100$ or -100$ , Now EA start trading. Once my equity reached 1100$ or -900$ EA will no more open any trade for today or until I start EA again.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Tarwadas Tickmill demo made new high today! Still doing very well. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
hi. i've installed the EA and i only get negative trades can please someone have the the preset file please whats the pair and time frame for this EA? thanks

--- 帖子 #528 ---
gj h1 negative trades are part of it. positive should outweigh eventually. thats the idea anyways

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I would like to test the EA too to see how it works so if you can post back the files again... thnaks in advance

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Have a look at the bottom of the first post, or the paperclip top right of the messages.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
omg, tarwada why don't you share us same ea on your vps? Please do it.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Dear Tarwada! Can you please upload the origin ea, whitch is in your vps, because the new one, is not the same. I've tested and not same. Thank you for your work. You are great! Aurora

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) hello sir, could you please add this function on this EA Buy on Moving avg. high and close on low or opposite sell on moving avg low close on high. All other functions are same. Here red is a pic of my account but trading manual Thanks sir

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I'm trying this EA and its almost only negative trades. Version 3.0 i trade gbpjpy one hour. am i doing something wrong? because 90% its bad trades thanks

--- 帖子 #535 ---
It can't be... Look at the picture below Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is the Tarwada acc where you can see the previous bar closed BELOW the 34 MA High ...and yet the buy series still continue, no close and reverse Tarwada rules from post 1: Enter Short When Price Closes Below 34 SMA applied to high

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Seems more reasonable

--- 帖子 #537 ---
guys please note that when you start running the ea in different time you should have unique and different opened positions each time than mine. also because the object is to reach 100$. sometimes my account close all the trades because it reached 100$ while your account is not then my account will take different positions after that to start over while your account still opening trades according to the strategy until it reaches the target (which is 100$). to proof that , i have opened a new demo account to test my v3.0 and here it is Login: 2089080088 Investor: y4tcdtw

--- 帖子 #538 ---
you can't follow my trading cycle because you ran the EA in a different time. that's it and the new demo account now is taking the exact same positions that im having in my old demo test (because the trend changed to up trend) and guess what ? the new demo test is almost 100% in return (from 200$ to almost 400$)

--- 帖子 #539 ---
[IMG]file:///C:/Users/Mats/Desktop/DetailedStatement.gif[/IMG] Attached Image (click to enlarge) On a IC market $10000 demo, 0,1 lot from start, 0,11 lot when passing $11000, now 0,14 lot. Start trading 160310. Up 47% on little more than a month. EA ver 2.0. Not exactly same trades as tarwadas, close when its under/ower sma 34 close. I think the EA use sma 34 close, does it Tarwda? Many thanks to Tarwada! Soon going live, thinking of use a trade copier for make it difficult for brooker intervention. Best wishes to You all Elovv

--- 帖子 #540 ---
i've also open a new demo account with 3.0 ver and 0.05 lot and 500$ tp and sl... What about your set for tp and sl? Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I haven't logged in to your account yet and I don't know if the broker allows US residents. If they don't, we can't download the demo. It seems to me that a large part of succeeding with this system is pair selection. It doesn't matter if the SMA is high, low or close or even if the entry is triggered by another trend indicator. What's important is to try to get in at the start of a new trend and then fly. This may take several losses in the beginning, as Dreamliner explained, until a trend is established. I had it running on EUR/USD only for a few days. It was taking small losses because the pair is in a trading range. This morning, there was a breakout that made up for the losses and more. I have to spend some time choosing pairs to put this on. What do you for pair selection?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
First $1000, now $1400, like Tarwa trading 0,01 lot and TP $100

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hello all, First i would like to give a special thanks to Dreamliner for giving us this wonderful system and then Tarwada for converting it into a MMM (Money Making Machine). I just came across this thread 2 days ago after reading the Dreamliner's HFT thread then read the whole of this too. I started a test with it today and placed the version 3.5 on the 28 forex pairs just to see how it would be. I set them up 2 hours before the Asian session and now just after London close, look what the monster has done to the $1,000 starting balance... over 100% profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although i have a suggestion for the entry and closure as i've manually been playing around with the 34 SMA High and Low to see how price behaves around them and this is my discovery that could eliminate or minimise the false entries about 70 - 80% BUY RULES Enter BUY when a candle closes above the 34 SMA (High) Exit all trades when a candle closes below the 34 SMA (Low) SELL RULES Enter SELL when a candle closes below the 34 SMA (Low) Exit all trades when a candle closes above the 34 SMA (High) Anyone can also apply the two 34 SMAs (High and Low) on their charts to see what i'm seeing here. If possible, implement the settings for the BUY ENTRY, BUY EXIT, SELL ENTRY AND SELL EXIT so each individual can use the settings that suit them. I hope Tarwada will implement this to the EA in order to make it more profitable by eliminating the wrong entry points and being able to ride the TREND to its END. Thanks for all your great works and more green pips to us all. Cheers, MM

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Do you have the same add-on trade rules as Dreamliner's? i.e. after a buy initial entry, buy another position on every down candle and after a sell initial entry, sell another position on every up candle

--- 帖子 #545 ---
[Quote = Murysco; 8871767] Olá a todos, primeiro eu gostaria de dar um agradecimento especial ao Dreamliner por nos dar este sistema maravilhoso e, em seguida, Tarwada para convertê-lo em um MMM (Máquina Money Making). Deparei-me com esta discussão 2 dias atrás depois de ler fio HFT do Dreamliner em seguida, ler toda a isso também. Eu comecei um teste com ele hoje e colocou a versão 3.5 em 28 pares de moedas só para ver como seria. Eu configurá-los 2 horas antes da sessão asiática e agora só depois de Londres perto, olha o que o monstro tem feito para os US $ 1.000 saldo inicial ... sobre o lucro de 100%. {Imagem} {image} Embora eu tenho uma sugestão para a entrada e fechamento como eu manualmente fui brincar com o 34 SMA High and Low para ver como se comporta preço em torno deles e esta é a minha descoberta que poderia eliminar ou minimizar o falso entradas cerca de 70 - 80% REGRAS BUY Enter comprar quando uma vela fecha acima da SMA (High) Exit 34 todos os comércios quando uma vela fecha abaixo do 34 SMA (baixo) VENDER REGRAS Enter vender quando uma vela fecha abaixo do 34 SMA (baixo) saia de todos os comércios, quando uma vela fecha acima da Qualquer um 34 SMA (alta) também pode aplicar os dois 34 SMAs (alta e baixa) em seus gráficos para ver o que eu estou vendo aqui. Se possível, implementar as definições para a COMPRA ENTRADA, COMPRE SAIR, VENDER ENTRADA E VENDER saída para que cada indivíduo pode usar as configurações que lhes convém. Espero Tarwada vai implementar isso para a EA, a fim de torná-lo mais rentável, eliminando os pontos de entrada errados e ser capaz de montar a tendência de seu fim. Obrigado por todas as suas grandes obras e mais sementes verdes para todos nós. Cheers, MM [/ quote] At what time you are trading with these pairs?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Yes thats the system rules, but i set the EA (ONE ENTRY PER DIRECTION) to FALSE, such that even after the initial entry has already occured, it will start trading from each opposite candle that closes.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
If you read the post well, you'll see where i mentioned that i set it up 2hours before the last Asian session ( less than 24hours ago)

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hi, what timeframes were you use in the test?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
H1

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi Muhammadji, I liked your trading strategy of high flyer trading. There should be some improvements i can suggest to add in new version. 1. After Closed trades with said money profit, it should start second time in same trend instead of touching/reversing second time to MA. 2. Instead of using SMA u should use super trend with 14,1.8multiplier it will give exact trend and lesser cutting. 3. There should be favor gap in formula (e.g. every favor of 200 points it adds an add-on lot). Instead of any time trading at the similar price. Thanks and reply if you like my suggestions. Wapp no +918866715158

--- 帖子 #551 ---
thank you so much !. yea , the whole idea is to ride the trend , it's not important whether it is on close \ high \ low for me , im testing this monster with GBP\JPY - 1H

--- 帖子 #552 ---
nice ........ very NICE ! i will consider adding (allow trade on specific time)

--- 帖子 #553 ---
one entry with add ons per trend direction change Trigger (True/False) : when set to true : this feature will open buy if close above 34 SMA. but if the trades were closed due stop loss or take profit limit , it will not open any further trades in the same trend direction until the trend direction is Change to sell

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Sounds like this is working out for everyone. I've been letting it run on demo on a couple of pairs on half hour charts. Doing ok so far.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
please what pairs do you trade? only GBPJPY?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
do you choose separate magic number for each pair?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Can You add that option to v3.0? (Problem is: when I close some trades, EA does not open new ones) v3.0 and v3.5 use the same trading rules now (like on demo)? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi friend thank you for sharing with us!!! For your suggestions entry/exit i think the EA works already in this way. If you look at Tarwada account you'll see above high-&gt;buy ; below low-&gt;sell

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi tarwada welcome back!!! Is not a bad idea to let the EA running with more pairs at the same time..I mean: attach the EA in 1 chart, but trade on many crosses. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
no that's dangerous. even with 1000$ capital and lot size of 0.01 , this EA is dangerous. running it in multiple charts will blowup your account for sure

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I went to tickmill .com and tried to login using these details posted on tarwadas profile page: 2089050424 anc7klo but it doesn't let me in, it's wanting an email address or 6 digit number instead. How do you get in to check out the EA please?? Cheers

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Click cancel, then a new pop up is there, im in now

--- 帖子 #564 ---
There is no 'cancel' option? Just says 'login failed' and that's it...

I just did it. You have to create a demo account with your credentials. Once you have the account, open MT4. Under File, go to Login to trade account. That's where you enter the login posted.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Well i haven't created a new demo account but i think i'm in, if someone could please tell me if i'm looking at the right thing (see pic below)?? Also, if i am in the right place, history tells me that the ea has made $112 profit since mid-march (about 5 weeks) using 0.01 lots. Am i reading that correctly? Sorry for the newbie questions... Bill

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Dear Murysco, I have a question to you...... Should we only need to apply the EA On H1 Blank Chart or we should definitely need to apply 34SMA High and 34SMA Low and EA will not work otherwise? Is this really read the graph weather the SMA34 high and Low are really exist on the chart or not ? Please explain in detail if there is any similar logic. Regards

--- 帖子 #569 ---
NO. You're wrong. Read the post again. Let me copy the post here from post 1 for you to see.The Current General Trading Rules :Enter Long When the Price Closes Above 34 SMA applied to lowadd Extra Positions after every opposite candles closeExit if Prices Closed below 34 SMAEnter Short When Price Closes Below 34 SMA applied to highadd Extra Positions when opposite candle closeExit if Prices Closed Above 34 SMAThat's how he stated it. But from my observation, the EA doesn't work that way as i have closely watched it at work, as it opens and closes trades, after applying 3 different 34 SMA on my chats (one set to HIGH, second set to LOW and the third set to CLOSE) I discovered that it uses the 34 SMA (CLOSE) and not as stated above.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
You need to apply one instance of the EA to each chart you wish to trade but you have to use different magic numbers on each chart.You don't have to apply any MA on the chart for the EA to work. But you may do that for visual purpose so as to see if the EA is doing the work correctly as it should. That's how I got to know that it works differently from what was stated.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
I'm testing this EA out of curiosity, it seems to open multiple positions at the same time for some pairs.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Well that will be why there hasn't been a single trade on my 28 pairs this past day then (testing on a demo a/c). So what do you change the 'magic numbers' to? Any old numbers?? Is there anything else you have to make different per chart? Cheers, Bill

--- 帖子 #573 ---
NO IS NOT LIKE THIS! Murysco LOOK BETTER AT THE CHART! BLUE : SMA HIGH RED : SMA LOW WHITE : SMA CLOSE Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see the buy opens even below the SMA applied to close and viceversa, then the EA works with HIGH/LOW MA . What tarwada wrote wrong is: Enter Long When the Price Closes Above 34 SMA applied to low instead of HIGH Enter Short When Price Closes Below 34 SMA applied to high instead of LOW

--- 帖子 #574 ---
I think the version you are using is different from mine because in verision 3.5 that i use, this is what happens : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also, even from the chart you posted, this is what i observed : Attached Image (click to enlarge) So here, the rules should be: BUY above SMA High and EXIT below SMA Low SELL below SMA Low and EXIT above SMA High No action should be taken when candles or price is in between them. Cheers MM

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi All, this is my first time posting after a long time (years) due to losses in this market and since I decided to return I came across this superb thread and it directed me to the mother thread Dreamliners'. This EA thread coupled with Dreamliners ideas I must say is going to be a revolution, though looking too simple to believe. In the meanwhile I will continue enjoying my stay here and hope it doesn't go down again. Many many thanks to the liberal and one of a kind Tarwada!!! Many thumbs up! And to all others, great work testing and refining. Many green pips to you all. Finally, @Murysco: From my understanding of the whole thing I think add-on trades (triggered by candles that closed in opposite direction) can be opened anywhere EXCEPT above the high of the 34SMAhigh in a SELL situation and vice-versa so I think those trades that opened in above your 34SMAclose should have been add-on trades. I hope I got it right. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hello, I test version 3.5. Can someone please remake the termination of all trades up above or below a candle that closes above or below the MA? Thank you. I Testing MA 100

--- 帖子 #577 ---
You got it right but i'm just suggesting that no trades should be opened within the margin of the HIGH and LOW of the 34 SMA as we are unsure where the price would head from there. It can either go up or down. So i suggest we wait for the cross of the HIGH up for a BUY and a cross of the LOW down for a SELL... including the add-on trades.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Yeah the middle is a dead zone for opening new trades. I agree and think it's a better indication to open trades when price comes back out of the SMA zone.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
people are ignoring the performance and focusing on how the positions are closed.... ahhh god

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Maybe you should release the source code and let them have at it.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Its a way to minimise the losses by eliminating some bad entries. Anyway, you've done a great job already but can be better.As you have mentioned earlier, comments and suggestions are welcomed, that's why I'm giving my 2 cents.MM

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks for your posting. I have been doing this method on my account manually and trade CFDs as well but I have never try to apply it on 28 charts. But it will worth to try it moreover I have requested the same from tarwada last time when I post my entry but I don't see it post the EA since it will be very helpful. Tarwada can you implement this small change in the next version please. Thanks again and again

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Not so Mr T, the performance is top notch but everything in life can be improved upon. And I sincerely think you take a look at what Murysco and L1ndgren mentioned. I think its worth it and would super fine tune the EA. Just a command line telling it not to enter add-on trades within the SMA zone - but don't know how simple or tough that would be for you since I don't know a darn thing about coding. You have done a great great job already please don't get pissed. @Murysco and L1ndgren : Good Thinking

Hi guys, the trick for this EA is your risk mgt and money mgt. This EA may take in many many small losses until the trend comes.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
There's nothing like the power of trend!!! With patience you can always win with this EA. Thanks tarwada!

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I watched EA trade visually on Back test with the 34 sma lines on chart and it appears to mess up on the HFT strategy? That's with default set. Maybe there is a better set?

I think this EA will always be successful since it cuts the loses early and cruises with the trend. Can you please share your settings, which EA, TF &amp; pairs for this test? Well done.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Yup ! Right ! Thx for sharing Elovv ! I'm curious to see your trading/setfile Details. One month of testing is a pretty good period ! Perhaps I have to consider a restart of my test stoped recently.

Attached File(s) HFT v2.0.ex4 237 KB | 836 downloads Here it is. I think its the same as 2.5 and 3.0, only difference is the "only one buy/sell per direction" I think they have same logic. Maybe its better to use only one buy per direction. Today with tp its a long way to sma34 sl. Best wishes

thanks very much elovv, yes the logic is supposed to be the same, but i found 3.0 is not trading identical to tarwadas master. so i will try this version

Why do I keep seeing H1 charts? Isn't this system made for H4 charts? The original concept was based on H4 charts. Why do we make trading so complicated?

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Dreamliner didn't require a specific timeframe for his system. He actually trades off the daily charts, though the charts he used in his examples are H4. He also didn't require the use of SMA 34 or even SMA really. It's just what he was using. It's a trend following system, so use whatever trigger you want that gets you in at the beginning of a trend. There's a pdf file attachment summarizing his system if you don't want to read the whole Dreamliner thread.

Does anybody have ver 2.5 of the EA? Please share it! Regards

--- 帖子 #603 ---
ok it seems that the EA is getting success BUT you have to pay attention to one thing : sometimes , you run the EA when it starts to lose (and that's a normal thing , it is a small period). when i say losing period , i mean these times :

--- 帖子 #604 ---
so the key here is to wait , and to start with large capital with small lot size

--- 帖子 #605 ---
It's a trend following system so the hit rate is going to be &lt; 40%. You'll have longer strings of losers in that environment than say a scalping system. Dreamliner's pyramiding approach is perfect for this since your initial trades are small.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
hello, I have tried to put this EA on 28 charts but failed. I don't know what was the problem. It only open 10 orders at the same time. I also tried different magic numbers but also failed. Could you please check it and see. I have tried on 5 min chart. But no luck. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #607 ---
you can't run this ea in more than one chart , that's dangerous. use one pair with small lot size and wait for it, it will succeed

--- 帖子 #608 ---
win to lose ratio doesn't matter as long as we're letting winning trades run while stopping losses once trend changed. so yea , i agree

--- 帖子 #609 ---
But why i could not open 28 orders only 10 orders

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Maybe you don't have enough capital?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Thanks for the EA tarwada, its weird in back testing results it all shows negative results, but my forward test shows that I'm in the positive ( 3 different demo account), In my 4 weeks of forward testing is that I've noticed that the positive trades will out weigh the negative trades at the end. and with a trending pair like GBP/JPY your trending periods can out weigh your negative results once the pair hits a consolidation area. Just for interest sake ill try to run the ea on a live Forex cent account just to see how the demo forward testing goes vs the live forward testing. Will keep you guys up to date.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi, this is an excellent AOS , but unfortunately does not work on my real account , you have some experience with that ? I have HFT v2.5 and HighFlyingTrading(HFT) v3.5 well thank you

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hey tarwada, Have you tried adding in code two MA check before opening new orders? As an example i have MA 50 in parameters set (using the same behavior as it does now) + 200 MA on H4 chart, you open orders as buy only when the price is above the 200 + the 50 MA, same for the other direction, and when the price is in between 200 and 50, you don't open any order there since it is a range where nothing is confirmed yet (Most bad orders are lost in that range), the exit would work the same as it does now with the price below the 50 MA (or whatever value you prefer to have in settings) Adding another MA for double check in the preferences would really help filter more bad orders, which makes the slow MA for entry confirmation, and the exit behaves like it does now with the faster MA. You can even add a check of ADX above 25 before opening new orders to avoid entering in ranging market (but not necessary) Edit : Would also be great if you could add a lot size management with risk percentage value, it doubles all those values (lots) entered in setting depending on the current balance and risk value

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Just had good read of this, nice thread. I don't use ea's but I trade a simple set forget based around an EMA setting for buys above and sells below which may be of use to you EA wizards. Very simply if price close above I stack orders 10-15pips apart depending on pair and always ensuring spread is cleared and last order has opened and closed prior to next order. Example: Orders every 10 pips TP every 8pips 1 lots, then 2 lots, then 3 lots and 4 then 5 and so on and so on. The account saver is that every 50pips I add exactly the same stack but in opposite direction. Its very straight forward and wins the day every day. All I do is set an alert for every 50pips to add my account savers. Hope it gives you EA guys something to think about. Good luck with this Green pips.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi hippie, i'm not quite sure to understand your strategy. Above SMA you buy every 10 pips (like a grid) increasing the lot size? Let's say after a candle cross up there is a trend of 100 pips. Then you'll open 10 trades with distance 10 pips each, with TP=8pips? And every step you increase the lot size, so if the first trade opens with 1 lot size then the last trade will have 10lots?

--- 帖子 #616 ---
yeah that's it but if price has traveled directly without any dragging of open trades in opposite direction 50 pips is it for the day. But should opposing trades be dragged then continue while setting up new account savers every 50 pips.Best used on GBP pairs on London breakout. Would not advise NFP etc if doing this manually. Just close out when your bucket is full of cash.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Thanks for this idea. I'm trying to see if I understand and have a few questions: 1. What ema and time frame do you start with? I realize that once you've started, time frame is irrelevant since your orders are all price based. 2. Do you use a tp of 8 pips on the account saver trades as well? 3. Do you ever hold trades overnight? 4. Do you ever have trades where the first order is triggered, price turns around and the 50 pip order is triggered and then price turns around and both trades are at a loss? How do you handle that? Thanks for sharing your ideas. Very interesting thinking.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
It is on 1H and 10 EMA for London breakout, for other events it is at your discretion.It is so straight forward and easily manipulated to your requirements.No trades usually closed by 1pm to 4pm sometimes within few hours.If you feel concern about both ways as soon as it turn for example on a 4 lot trade from a 5 lot other way if it turns to continue again trade from 6 lot.I have large account so this is a bit of game for me so if starting on small account trade small.But every 8 pips you are profiting so key is to pay attention to equity against P/L if you not making more than your P/L you have done something wrong.But please manipulate this to your requirements it is so simple. And if you can make it work for NFP etc you will be laughing. I don't like trading big news with this style of trading especially with the dangers of a fast whipsaw.But will watch thread to see if you guys do anything good with it.Green pips. Edit. One more thing is Bollinger bands 100/2 If above midline looking for above 10ema, if below midline looking for lower lows. Or use 100 EMA. London session really respects a tight EMA like the 10ema so well worth using for this EA.

I once had a system that did very well, it was based strictly on USDJPY. The system did well, until i started using it to trade EURUSD. My point is a bit simple, like a posted some time back: H4 is the best and safest time frame. fewer entries, and a quick exit opportunity. I honestly don't think this approach is viable on a one hour chart...my personal opinion of cos.. I have been following the Tickmill demo account, and i can easily say the profits would be much better on H4. Took some trades off gbpchf and eurcad

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi Tarwada! I can see a problem with EA ver 2.0. If I change time or restarr computer or Mt4 the EA stops taking new positions before all trades are closed. Thats the only problem I can see. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I fully support your statement. The H4 timeframe is the best with this strategy. I ran 3 demo accounts on H1, H4 &amp; Daily. By far the H4 was better than the others. Unfortunately I did not save the history before stopping these tests.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Dear tarwada, are you running on vps with H1 or H4 timeframe tell me why always end blew account in backtest and your demo is rocking ? thank you

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Exactly

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi, Id like to backtest the EA, but any version, from 2.5 to 3.5 has no input parameter description for me (MT4 build 950): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any ideas and you can just share the MQ4 possibly? I think this related to a compiling problem between different platform versions. The EA itself starts the backtest, but just opens one buy and one sell trade that stays open forever and is only closed at the end of the backtest.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Took some time, but now its up 86%. From now I trade 0,18 lot, Initial size 0,36, adds on 0,18, max 5 trades. Works great on Ic demo. When/if is $20 000 on that account I will golive. There are some coding that could be done better i guess, but mostly it works perfect. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Looks good, which pair(s) and which version of the EA + which settings do you use there?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Although Late but I will be happy if you reply. I also like H4 but about which i have serious concerns. H4 candle totally broker(time zone) dependent. How you overcome this issue?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hy .. any update here? Have you start to trade live with this system? Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Yes, my IC demo is up more than 100%. Now I trade live using a trde copier from IC demo. But I,m soon stop trading live because Brexit, start again after Brexit.

Hi Can you post what version pair and settings are u using? thx in advance

--- 帖子 #636 ---
HI, Please where is the link to download the HFT

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I think Elovv posted his "instruments" earlier. But right, it would very interesting to have what's actually used once more bcz Elovv's results look quite amazing ! And yes - I seems to me Elovv is making from time to time some considerable manual interventions ? At least he switchs of the bot at red news or so - right ? @Elovv: do you close all the trades bevor switching of ? Colud you describe a bit your manual interventions ?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Agreed! much better on H4 and D1

--- 帖子 #639 ---
@Elovv: Do you still use the same EA/setfile posted earlier in #592 + #595 ? I would run them forward at TF H4 + daily !

--- 帖子 #640 ---
This seems to be a safer method to adding to trades on the H4 time Frame It's called Flying buddha trading system Once In trade He Adds Position 50% retracement of 4Hr Candles Then Place SL on AddOn Trades Above H/L of Previous candles. I've Enclose PDF for further Details. '

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi Tarwada, I'd like to do a backtest with your EA as accurate as possible (quality 99.90%). I take the basic data from Dukascopy Bank - Data Quality 99.90%. Leverage 1: 500 Year 2014 until 2015 (2 years full date - I haven't the 2016 data). Pairs: AUDUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD. But I have a problem: to ensure that the result is accurate and truthful as I need the EA has been executed with a metaeditor version of 765 or before. So, could you post the mq4 version of your EA? Otherwise, please execute mq4 file with this: http://www.mediafire.com/download/hr...metaeditor.zip and reupload the EA. Thanks. Suraj

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi ! Look Elovv's results of long time forward trading here in this thread ! That's a better proof then all these fancy doubtful BT's ! Tarwada is doing his Job on it's own now ... I think he wont answer anymore ? Why should he care about this thread having success ?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I'm 10 trades in with this EA - all losers and down over 400 pips. Is this normal? I'm trading on G/J on 1hr TF, default settings.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
i've run numerous tests with this EA. the original system is designed for the higher timeframes and if you want my advice, avoid H1 with this system like the plague. Run this EA on either the H4 or Daily timeframes. H4 seems to be a good sweetspot though, i'm running it on 4 pairs and my demo account has doubled over the last 2 months or so. There will be periods of drawdown like all trend following systems but when it hits a home run it does well, you will need patience though. my $0.02

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Yep I fully agree ! I had very "mixed" results using this EA v2.0 at TF H1 ... in the past ! Look here my actual results at H4: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-gp-44/1692413

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Thanks for the tip. Will give it a go on the 4hr.

I agree with you. It's all false. I have absolutely no ideia why is that on the forum. Absolutely shame

--- 帖子 #649 ---
guys sorry im very busy these days. is everything ok ? any ideas , questions ? because im working on something bigger and better than this and i dont login here a lot because backtests are false 100% wanna make sure?, do a backtest from the time i started the EA untill today, you'll see a different results than my demo test(which is more reality than backtest)

--- 帖子 #650 ---
I was wondering if it'd be fairly easy to add another position at a 50% retrace of the previous candle, like the flying budda method? E.g. trend is up, add a position at the 50% retrace of previous candle as well as any down candles. Not confident it would be workable though.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
checkout the first post, i said that we must try this ea on different TFs in order to know the best settings and since the original rule didnt come from an arc angel , we have to try everything we have in hands yea i saw the pdf file and i'll try to do it to see the results

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Welcome back.... My 2 cents just to ask if you consider useful to avoid orders too far from sma 34 to minimize dd in case of large St. Regards

--- 帖子 #653 ---
What you working on tarwada sounds exciting?!?!

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Could you please release the source code for the EA?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
@Magregus: Yes I use v2.0 like Elovv, and I use Elovvs setfile as well. He posted this setfile earlier - see some sites ago. See his comments about his live trading with this EA at pages 30-31-32, especially look the EA/setfile at p. 30 ! The Point is, what amount of money to set up for the basket TP and SL. I used 100 both for TP and SL with a start capital 1k ! That's very risky. Bcz 5...6 loosers in a row during flat market phases will generate a high DD of 50...60% ! Or in trend makets you could have an easy quick win of 50...60% ! Actually I switched to TP + 60 and SL - 50 ... but perhaps even smaller numbers could be better - that means less risky. But that is a matter of further more detailed testing. Btw: tarwadas long time running account connected to the Broker Tickmill , posted here by him in this thread earlier, is up for months now - still alive and doing a nice job .... with ups and downs ... but in summary it is a winner yet !

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Actual results until friday - I closed the 2-nd basket at friday evening manually. Test start was july 4. https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-gp-44/1692413 If someone is experimenting with this EA plz post your MFXB-links/setings with different basket TP/SL and different basket CRVs here !

--- 帖子 #657 ---
what is your SL and TP like? plus TF

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Read my post above, bro ! Or look Elovvs post #592, there you find his setfile: General_Settings= SMA_Period=34 Initial_Lot_Size=0.15 Add_On_Lot_Size=0.15 Break_Even=0 Break_Even_Add_pips=0 Trailing_Stop=0 Trailing_Stop_Activation=0 Max_Trades=0 Magic_Numbers_Settings=Use Big Random Numbers Between Add-Ons Initial_Buy_Magic_Number=1 Initial_Sell_Magic_Number=2 Buy_Add_On_Magic_Number=1000 Sell_Add_On_Magic_Number=20000 Extra_Settings=Extra Settings For Exiting The Trades Close_Positions_Rule_1=Close All Positions When Your Account Is Doubled x Times Close_Positions_Rule_1_is=false Number_Of_Doubles=1 Close_Positions_Rule_2=Close All Positions When Open Profits Is x In Money Close_Positions_Rule_2_is=true Profits_In_Money=1500.0 Close_Positions_Rule_3=Close All Positions When Open Losses Is x In Money Close_Positions_Rule_3_is=true Losses_In_Money=-1500.0 Close_Positions_Rule_4=Close All Positions When Open Profits Is x In Pips Close_Positions_Rule_4_is=false Profits_In_Pips=0 Close_Positions_Rule_5=Close All Positions When Open Losses Is x In Pips Close_Positions_Rule_5_is=false Losses_In_Pips=0 I use like Elovv only rule 2+3 in the settings printed above ! You must adapt your numbers for Profit+Loss (and of course for lot size too !) to your own start capital - it seems for collecting 1500 means - in my eyes - you must have a capital of at least 15.000 (although depending of the lot size) ... or much more .... ! All in all ist up to you what numbers suit you.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
seem like a good set up!

Hello Tarwada, can I use this EA on a live account?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi Tarwada Am trying the EA on H1 and H4 TF on GBPJPY on separate accounts with 2 different brokers I started 3 weeks ago and so far so good The only new thing I tried is started with 0.02 lot initially and then increment of 0.01 lots using the first EA (V3.0) with target ptrofit of $25 On the second account am using an initial lot of 0.04 and then increment of 0.02 lots with target profit of $100 also on V3.0 Are you trying something bigger and better on the same EA or new EA. Hope you can share as am interested in your EA always.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Great EA! Thanks for sharing. I'm using it in a demo account and the results are great so far.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
I am kinda new here.i will ttest the ea in the coming week.i have suggestion for the ma param...that the param shud include exponential,linear and smoothed varieties too which mt4 affords us too!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Addition of a second ma filter will work absolute wonders in filtering flat...it is also far easier to implement as far as coding effort goes...can anyone kindly come forward...my last post which is my first here on the forum also got no response ..hope some experienced kind coder can include the last two suggestions..might just take a jiffy for an experienced coder!! The end product will be a gem!!!

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Bump to see if anyone is stuff playing with this? Been running it on demos on 1hr and 4hr with decent results. Although I didn't realize I needed 3.5 to run multiple pairs. Also wondering if version 3.5 will open another trade if the breakeven stop is hit, e.g. enters 11 positions one gets taken out at breakeven, will it open another at the close of the next qualifying candle? I don't seem to get getting trades with every up candle in a downtrend and vice versa either.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
This is still going strong for me on a handful of H4 charts. Definitely a 'slept on' EA here (i think this is because its really set and forget - and requires a little patience to see the profits accumulating) for me chugging along very nicely and seeing balance and equity steadily rising over the months. as per a good trend trading system and in keeping with Dreamliner's original vision, losses happen but they're linear - and profits are exponential once a trend takes off. I'm using v2.5 and it seems to run fine on multiple pairs. although sometimes it seems trades are being missed on a 34 sma crossover, perhaps i should upgrade.. Rub, tip: to ensure re-entry trades, make sure that 'one entry per direction' is set to false

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Good to know, what sort of position sizing you're using? I've been playing with .01 lots per 100$ for the first trade and half that rounded down for the subsequent ones. I've got one entry per direction set to false, might have to to do more digging about what's going wrong, as it will open a couple of trades then it seems to stop.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
im using slightly more conservative lot settings. initial balance was £3000 and im using 0.1 lots as initial entry with 0.05 lots as add-ons

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Thanks! this is the sort of problem I've been having, clearly above 34sma, with the lines being 34sma high/low, but on down candles it's not opening another trade.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I'm waiting for the next version, because of Money Manager.

It's a really pity cause this Ea it's quite good.. We maybe need some other coders interested in this logic th's quite simple and proftable... I'm folowing Tarwada account but seems tha something happens in the account cause i see ea doesn't close orders anymore.... so maybe vps or Ea is down.... Regards

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Honestly to day I tried this EA some time .... all in all it failed (for me). In good trend markets - great results ! In flat markets these gains disapperaed almost completely or the account turned even into a looser ....

put it on h4 charts, a few pairs, honestly i dont know how you can go wrong. its nearly doubled my demo account in a couple of months

I used only the pair GBPJPY at the H4 like you proposed above ...........

Hello Tarwada, Does your EA work with AxiTrader or HiWayFX? i try to add it in but seem not work.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
It should work fine, i didn't limit my EA to specific broker

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Ladies and gentlemen. After 6 months of success i can confirm that the EA is good enough to work for long term with small lots on real account The broker closed the demo account because it exceeded 6 months so I'll upload the detailed report for you when i get back home ❤

--- 帖子 #684 ---
How to use ur EA ? I need only to put it on the chart and it will earn on default settings ?

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Hmmm ... nice to hear about good news again ! It worked in my case really good in trend markets. Many times the gains disappeared in flat phases. So are you trading this EA fully handsfree ? Or is it necessary to intervene manually ? Anyway could you plz again in detail post your approach ? It would be great to have exactly the same instruments what you used these 6 months: EA + setfile !

--- 帖子 #686 ---
i can confirm its a good EA. it makes a lot more during a good run than it gives back on exploratory unsuccessful runs, as per the original idea of the system - **as long as** you stick to higher timeframes, H4 and D1. too many times people are putting this on an H1 chart it wasn't designed for and complaining about lack of success. my problem is i'm using v2.5 on my demo and it still has some bugs, such as not entering on crosses of 34SMA and sometimes not exiting on time. eg on the attached screenshot, the EA did not take the USDJPY long in the circled yellow area even though there was a breach of the 34SMA. Curiously the trade was taken on the GBPJPY pair. tarwada can you address this issue? thanks Attached Image

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Very nice congrats, and who has the best .set file setting here!!? haha Plus what PAIR are you guys finding the most profitable and less risk ?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
here is the detailed report : Attachment DON"T FORGET TO USE THE EA ON HIGHER FRAMES (H4 and 1H ONLY)

--- 帖子 #689 ---
thanks for the statement. are you sure you meant 1H or did you mean D1? as i have found more reliable on H4 and D1 and original system creator also recommended H4 or D1 blam

I am quite amazed that the account managed to survive the Brexit day (24th June) in which there was a drop of nearly 2700 pips in one shot. I think H4 is even better than D1 on GBPJPY. Good job tarwada.

Hi, Tarwada, I would propose two new features for your EA, both as options to be able to test them in Backtest and Forwardtest and see if they are real improvements: 1) One was already mentioned in the original post by abokwaik: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=576707&amp;page=10 He said: Note about re-entries : 1. They should never be at a price better than our last entry. 2. Example : If we are in an up-trend, our next buy should never be at a price lower than our last re-entry. The same if we are in an down-trend: our next sell should never be at a Price higher than our last re-entry. To simplify this, I would recommend following: - If we are in uptrend, never open a new position at a price lower than the most recent entry (or re-entry) which is still open. The same in a down-trend. - I say most recent entry which is still open . This means that previous entries (or reentries) which had been already closed (for example, by break-even closing parameter) should be discarded . Only pay attention to previous entries which are still open. 2) The second feature would be to make an option to change 34 SMA for SuperTrendIndicator as new trigger (it does not repaint). You can get it here: http://www.marketcalls.in/metatrader/non-repainting-supertrend-indicator-with-sound-and-popup-alerts.html General Trading Rules for Supertrend indicator : Enter Long When Supertrend gives buy signal add Extra Positions after every opposite candles close (+option for testing Abokwaik caution already mentioned) Exit all if SuperTrend gives sell signal Enter Short opposite

Hello Tarwada, it's not work here. please kindly advise how to set up, thank you.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Tarwada, could you please send me attached file of HFT, i would like to use your EA. Big thanks.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Thanks alot for the ea.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
sir, which time frame gives best result, daily or 4 hours?

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi all! I'm sorry for what may occur a stupid Q, but how to make it run? Live trading is On, Auto trading is On, DLL imports is allowed. Please help.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
How can I access to the EA mql4 file because ex4 file is not opening with my charts? KINDLY HELP

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Try the first post. I've had good success on 4hr. Make sure you've restarted metatrader?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Any suggested pairs to apply this EA on? I've tried running on demo for a week with the USDCAD pair. It works like a charm!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Trending pairs are good! GJ, Ucad, AJ

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Would be nice to have the comment field added to the EA so you can see which EA in my MT4 is doing fine. HFT is enough as a comment.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
i've been running the EA since last morning , on eur/usd and on gbp/jpy so far nothing . Am i doing something wrong i use time frame 1 h

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hello. So everybody is finished with this indicator? What are the optimal seetings to run it? TF? Pairs? Any live account results? You've been using standard settings?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I've been running it on 4HR, on a AUD/USD and EUR/AUD, it done quite well. Doubled my account on GDP/JPY in a week, but it also suffered a 50% drawdown. Lot size is very much the key, or identifying a trend as it crosses the moving average. Default settings on GBP/JPY took a $200 demo account to about $1500 in six months, in testing by the OP.

Ragusa plateman's SuperTrend auto trading robot by Steve Hopwood EA see http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=268038 &amp; http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=339192 (Flying Buddha) Perhaps, Tarwanda can modify EA so It can utilized High Flying Trading Method For Retracement Re Entries Because SuperTrend Indicator have less Whipsaw.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Thanks, Rainsome, for the information! I also think, like you, that these features could be valuable improvements of the EA, at least as options to be tested. Lets us hope that Tarwada has the time and will to implement them! Here is the indicator in Mql4 source file:

--- 帖子 #709 ---
This Kolier SuperTrend indi offers two Trend modes (original and improved). For more information see here: http://kolier.li/indicator/how-super...nson-jnrtradin May be a better option than the original ST indi. Addenda : After thinking again about it, in my opinión the “original” trend mode is more suitable for this strategy, because it gives definitely more breadth to the Price. The “improved” trend mode is too close to it at the beginning of a new trend.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Nice indicator, I'll work around it and I'll release a new thread if it worked well ! ❤

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Ragusa, and Tarwada and all other members who contributed to this thread and other threads. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and trading experiences. That's what I love about this forum because it helps aspiring traders become more attune of what works and what don't works in the markets. And it help filter and navigate this dynamic market so we all can reach our destinations of being profitable traders, have my gratitude.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi! Are you still planning on making the updates from the first post? The only on am really keen on is placing pending orders, say at the 50% mark of previous up candles in a downtrend. Should reduce drawdown a bit, but hell, you've done excellent work for a free EA. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Hi, Tarwada, nice to hear again from you. I would recommend the SuperTrend indi from posts 708 or 709 (original trend mode), better than the one of post 707. The reason is that the version of post 707 (nrp) is too near (too close) to the Price, and in a trend you need some breadth so that you dont get stopped out too soon. Of course, the best solution would be to have several options in the parameters of the EA that we could backtest. Abokwaik caution would be also useful as an option for backtest. May it be posible to achieve that the EA does not lose control of open positions when you close the Metatrader platform and reopen it afterwards? Thank you, Rainsome, for your kind words!

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Also as an option for backtest, it would be worth to explore a filter with 200 periods EMA. Rules as described by Rajandran ( www.marketcalls.in ): http://www.marketcalls.in/amibroker/...d-filters.html Trading Rules Buy if suptrend shows a buy signal and candle above 200 EMA (Green Arrow) Exit Buy if supertrend shows a exit signal (Yellow Star) Short if suptrend shows a sell signal and candle below 200 EMA (Red Arrow) Exit Short if supertrend shows a exit signal (Yellow Star) Trades are Executed on the close of the Candle ​ Of course, this strategy should maintain the reentries. This filter has been already mentioned by other members of this Fórum (see post 664).

Ragusa SL250pips On D1 TF Entries 1%or 2% should be split into 3 Positions With 3 different Exits 50SMA &amp; 100EMA As my guide In Trend. Your right supertrend_nrp_amp_alerts is too close to price. In my Opinion it is better to use it as an always in entries only exits the trade when the color change colors it keeps you in the trade longer. I)And Only initiate Reversal Trend Entries if SuperTrend Reverses And Change Colors above the 100 EMA See Greg M .A) Inserted Video II)Stop Loss can be 1)Prior Swing low Or 2)Few pips Above SuperTrend Line Or 3)ATR 10x1.618. III)Exits (TakeProfits) 1)1st Exit 26KJ Turns Up &amp; Candle Closes. When In Sell Trend 2)2nd Exit Both 52KJ Turns Up &amp; SuperTrend Trend turns Up &amp; Candle Closes When in Sell Trend. 3)3rd Exits can also be the Candle Closes above 100EMA When in Down Trend. IV)Add Ons In direction Of Trends: 1)3Bar Pivots See Steve Primo B) Inserted Video 2)Inside Days 3)Stochastics OS Bear Trend Bear see Steve Primo C) Inserted Video 4)Stochastics OB Cross 80 Line Down in Bear Trend see Raynor Teo D) Inserted Video V)Getting Back In with trend As long as price is under 50SMA And 100EMA in Down Trend Vice Versa for Up Trends. Use 9TK,26KJ, and 52KJ Histogram &amp; SuperTrend To change colors to get back in line with trend. VI If we are in a Daily Trend there can be small pullbacks within that trend that can be several 100pips. If you try to trade a downtrend in the middle of an Up Swing or Correction its going to be hard to be profitable. These 300-900 Major Pullbacks, Traders needs to be concern with, on how to Identify when these Pullbacks are over. We would never be able to get the very top and bottoms of trends. Technician don't eat the head &amp; tails of a fish, we only need to eat the chunk of meat in the middle to be profitable. If you look at the D1 chart I've enclose you can see there are 843p,959p,1008p,920p,and 820p Pullback within the GBPJPY Daily trend.

Strom I having Problems with A)TroPeriodData so I Uploaded a more recent one,and B)ATR in Pips I uploaded an updated one as well. Here' the second group of indicators make sure you download both indicators from both groups &amp; the 3rd group I have coming up along with Template so your charts look like mines. Trade whatever time frame your money managements allows. Part2 Of 3

Hi Lanzo Read Post 715 It gives a breakdown of my Entries and My Exits points and I also included video for references purposes. Also look at the chart in post 715 image You can see The white Vertical lines are my Entries Stop Loss 250 pips I allowed the market to tell me when to get out of position by using Ichimoki Histogram of A)26 TK as my first Exit once It turned Blue and candle close marked by the Yellow Vertical lines. B)2)2nd Exit Both 52KJ histogram Turns Up &amp; Super Trend Trend turns Up &amp; Candle Closes Marked by Yellow Vertical lines, When in Down Trend. C)3)3rd Exits can also be the Candle Closes above 100EMA Marked by Yellow Vertical Lines When in Down Trend. PS Use caution when using Candle Close 100EMA as exits if you didn't get in on the 1st Wave(Reversal) . Because price can be too far away from the 100EMA. 1)And worst case scenario you may be in the last leg of the Down Trend that fails to take out prior swing low. 2)Then you may be stuck in a consolidation period where The currency pair goes no where. 3)Currency pair original direction quickly reverses the other way. II)You can use whatever Time Frame your money management allows D1 is used as a example. III)As For The Template I've posted it in Post # 719 (Most have all Indicators from all 3 groups &amp; Template To have the chart look that I've Uploaded in Post #715 &amp; #719)

Ragusa, you welcome. Even though custom indicators and EA's are good tools for traders. Everything needs to be back tested EA's and manually strategies alike. We need to be versatile in our approach when dealing with the markets. There's is always something knew to learn our education never stops. I've seen personally that sometimes when Forex brokers updates its MT4 platform it causes some of your older EA's and custom indicators to be non workable. This programmer is a genius, He Created "Simple Forex Tester" that allowed you to test standard, and custom indicators, and multiple time frame of any Currency Pair manually back testing within MT4. Now It Doesn't work on any new MT4 Build , and he created the Software in 2011. see A1) Inserted Video . see B1)FX Blue Trading Simular V2 Inserted Video B2)FX Blue Trading Simulator v3 Download for free With registration http://www.fxblue.com/appstore/39/mt4-trading-simulator (Does Almost the Same thing Simple Forex Tester Does) C1)Forex Tester 3 1)Allows replaying your trading history in MT4 for finding out your strong and weak points &amp; 2)To Save projects, continue FX Testing later from where you left off, Instead of starting testing over from scratch every time you Close &amp; Load MT4 Platform (At Which is Golden for Traders) see Inserted Video C2)Forex Tester 3 Download https://www.forextester.com/order $250-$300 (Cant use custom Indicators unless you convert Mql4 file to dll files.) So if your custom Indicators or EA's no longer work, you still know how to trade with standard Indicators(MA's)etc that provided by Forex Brokers. If You Use 1)10EMA &amp; 20EMA Cross 2)12EMA &amp; 36EMA Cross 3)34EMA Close 4)34EMA High &amp; 34EMA Low Combination 5)50 SMA Close 6)100EMA &amp; 200EMA Close 7)20 NonlagMaDots 8)SuperTrend 9)ATR 9X3 10)ATR 10X4 11)Ichimoku Cloud BO 12)9TK &amp; 26TK Cross or any other methods to determine the trend you now have the means to back test these manual strategies to see if its profitable in the long term. Trading can be one of the most rewarding, as well as the most challenging, businesses out there. Overall the tools to take part in it are minimal compared to most industries. While you do need initial trading capital, a computer, internet access and a decent broker, this is a far cry from managing employees, tracking inventory, collecting receivables, planning for equipment purchases, keeping the board of directors happy, and a whole host of other requirements for many traditional businesses. Trading It is kind of a lonely pursuit. By not having a board of directors or shareholders to hold you accountable, it means that no one will stop you from wiping out your account. You'll your own boss. The organization chart starts and ends with you the individual trader. This is a blessing and a curse! It takes hard work, perseverance, dedication and a mental toughness. The markets is a proponent of tough love, not coddling. Treat the markets with the respect they deserve and you will be rewarded! Some traders Become profitable their first year, Others it can take 5 years or more, Some never experience being profitable because psychological problems, Poor money management techniques not utilazing 2:1 or 3:1 Stop Loss Take Profits ratios, not letting winners run, holding on to loses too long. As long as I know I did my due diligence. I went to www.babypips.com , read trading books, went to forums to learn from other traders, watch Youtube trading videos, learn aspect of money mangment techniques (Van Thorp Definitive Guide To Position Sizing). I can hang my head up high weather success alludes me or not, I gave it my all. I just wanna be that Catalyst That Sparks Traders(Entrepreneurs) school of thoughts as other Forum members done for me. On the Journey to reach the highest level possible in trading success.

I) Strom, You Can Trade Any Time Frame You see A Good Set Up On. The One Minute Charts, All the way to Monthly Time Frame (My lowest Time Frame Preference is M15 I chose not to go any lower) that your Money Management Plans allows. Because the bigger Time frame you trade the bigger Your Stop Loss Will be. Once You Drop Down to the lower Time Frames or Higher, You Can Use The ATR in Pips Indicator as Your Guide for Stop Loss placement. It automatically adjust es to the Time Frame you are on. If you don't want to use Supertrend or Prior Swing High when in Down Trends. II)Based on the Time Frames you are on, you must adjust the settings of, (2 Indicators The (LotCalcuator &amp; Mult RangeCalculator) A)LotCalculator StopDistanceInPips=1)M15-M30=53pips 2)H1=90pips 3)H4=140pips 4)D1=252pip 5)W1=750pips 6)MN=1050pips via This is not the end all be all its only an example You must adjust StopLossDistances according to Volatility of Currency Pair at that moment. (ATR In Pips &amp; Multi RangeCalulator) &amp; according to your settings helps you make that determination. How did I come up with my calculation for Stop Loss? A)M1-D1 Time Frames I've Used ATR in Pips Indicator B)W1 TimeFrames I Us Multi RangeCalulator AverageRange Numbers Indicator Of The W1 Settings 10080 C)MN TimeFrames I Us Multi RangeCalulator AverageRange Numbers Indicator Of The MN Settings 43200 III)Multi RangeCalculator TimeFramesSettings=1)M1.M5.,M15,M30,H1=1440 (D1) 2)H4=10080 (W1) 3)D1=43200 (MN) You can created a Template for each TimeFrame Group to make things a little easier without having to always keep adjusting of settings when you go to a different Time Frame.

Ragusa, Yes Forward testing and Backtesting EA's and Manual Strategies goes Hand and Hand There's shouldn't be one with out the other. 1) What settings that you are using for Kolier Super Trend? 2)How are you exiting your trades? 3)Is it at a breach or Candle Closes of Koiler SuperTrend? Because It is at a good distance from price to help you stay in trend, along with an excellent visual representation of where your trailing stop should be(To Lock In Profits) in alignment with the Current Down trend on H4 Time Frame as trend progresses. I'm glad your having success with The High Flying Trading System v3.5 EA Created by Tarwada. It's a beautiful thing to Bear Witness To. Tarwada Creator Of And Moderator Of This Thread Is A Coding Genius. I'm glad that he decided to share and contribute his coding skills to ForexFactory members free of Charge. PS I found Abokwaik A Programing Peer Of Tarwada Thread called Robot Lab Projects see 1) http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=517564 which he back tests various successful Manual Strategies and creates a EA's for which has back testing results. Perhaps Abokwik &amp; Tarwada could collobarate and exchange ideas with other Forum members in the quest to advanced more and more.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
hi ragusa, r u running EA on default settings ?

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Dear Rainsome: 1) As a matter of fact, I use SuperTrend indi only as information, because the Tarwada EA works with SMA 34 and nothing else. Well, you know that already. The versin of the indi that I use is Supertrend v1.1 Alert-Marketcalls by Rajandran (see post 714). The settings you can find in the attached screenshot (standard). 2) How I am exiting the trades? The EA closes the trades when it gets an opposite signal from SMA 34 (when the candle closes above/below SMA). So, this is the standard way to exit the trade. But it is more usual to get stopped out by Breakeven SL (I have this parameter activated, so the EA attachs a BE Stoploss to each position after 20 pips profit, with 2 pips lock). I use also a Trade manager to trail the basket profit of the four pairs (from 1500 $ with a 75% lock). 3) Already answered in 2). Thank you for the information about Abokwaik. I will look into it for sure!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Almost standard! Look to what I said in post 732. SMA 34 lots: initial 0,15 Add-ons: 5 x 0,12 5x 0,1 (this lots are for a capital of about 10000). Breakeven: 20 / 2 (lock) Trailing: no trailing with the EA; I use a Trade manager to trail the basket profit of the four pairs (from 1500 $ with a 75% lock). Closes all positions (by EA): automated close when profit in money is 2700 and when losses in money are -1000 (you should optimize this numbers for each pair; for GBPJPY these ones may be used). All other parameters are 0 or disabled. I do also some manual intervention to avoid undesired add-ons. So I dont permit new add-ons if the last position of the pair is not already protected by Breakeven SL. This filter is implemented by switching from "Long&amp;Short" in standard parameters to "Long only" or "Short only". This manual intervention may be the reason that I get very few Add-ons. May be the EA becomes distorted because of that. I dont know exactly. Trade at your own risk and test your settings to adapt them to your needs!

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Ragusa, thanks for feed back According to the Website link, The Webinar on Super trend and Filters Video Stated He use A)Period=10 B)Factor(Multiplier)=4 The image provided from Post 714 the link doesn't show the settings. 1)HighFlyingTradingV EA 3.5 Is your Entry Per Direction True or False?

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Sorry. I forgot to attach the screenshot with settings of Supertrend v1.1. Here it is. "One entry per direction": false "Capital protection is": false Pairs selection is of very great importance; most of them are not suitable for this strategy. After my BT year to date, the four of my screenshot in post 728 are best (GBPJPY the King and GBPCHF second; EurGbp and GBPCAd in third and fourth place). May be you could also trade GPBAUD, but not so good (huge DD). But, of course, the market will change someday. So we must backtest often. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Ragousa Thank You

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hi Tarwada, I have question. The EA which has 34SMA, instead of that can we use any other SMA - if yes - will it work using the different SMA? Take your time to reply no hurry. by the way your EA is fantastic. No complaint. Bomi

--- 帖子 #738 ---
hi, what hft version you use for acheive your ft result?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
hi, can you link your demo result via fxbook or mql5 link? i want to see the version 3.5 performance?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi, Merlin, not very much to see because the EA is now almost frozen by my manual intervention. I have not the time to care about the link, but I will inform later about the end of the trade, which is still open and already trailing the profit.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Latest version from first page, v3.5

--- 帖子 #742 ---
thanks, can you tell me which pairs you use in this version? and what setting you use?

--- 帖子 #743 ---
ok, i just want to know how this ea performance. if you has account link about it . it will be better, but why you interven this ea trades?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
I explained it already in post 733: " I do also some manual intervention to avoid undesired add-ons. So I dont permit new add-ons if the last position of the pair is not already protected by Breakeven SL. This filter is implemented by switching from "Long&amp;Short" in standard parameters to "Long only" or "Short only". This manual intervention may be the reason that I get very few Add-ons. May be the EA becomes distorted because of that. I dont know exactly". You may also read post 693 (nº1) which makes reference to Abokwaik´s proposals about add-ons.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Finally, the trades of post 728 closed today with a profit of 1445 euros or 1115 points, making 7,64% virtual profit. I was trailing at 75%, which means that the highest floating profit reached was 1926 euros. At close, I had the same 5 positions of last post (2 GbpChf, 1 GbpJpj, 1 Eur Gbp, 1 GbpCad). No more add-ons since 19 September which is very frustrating.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
thanks for notify me the result, i still figuar this ea best setting. hope can achieve success with this ea.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
results on default settings look like ass, just countless losses, adding breakeven settings will just potentially lower the losses, but haven't seen any winners yet, just running the last couple of days.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
make sure your're trading h4 minimum if not d1 charts. load it on a few pairs which trend, believe me this is a bulletproof system, been demoing for a few months and you WILL be profitable. if you read the original manual trading thread of the EA you will understand the concept, you will get small losses but when a trade takes off it does so in a big way and compounds the win by stacking impossible to lose with this EA if you have the patience to let it run and use a sensible money management. remember it is a trend following system so just have patience and dont expect immediate huge gains, but trust me they will come

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Hi blamshakk, In your point of view what pair is more profitable in 4h TF?

--- 帖子 #750 ---
you can try gbpjpy, usdcad, audusd and nasdaq /sp500 if your broker allows it . you can also do a quick visual test, load up some pairs with a 34sma running through and you can see which pairs have good swings / runs above and below the 34 SMA

--- 帖子 #751 ---
i put v3.5 version in h4 with several pairs these days, it only loses, not see any positive yet, i do not know how it can be turn positive, i use default setting.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Yeah I am running on H4 charts will just wait and see what happens. Can you post your settings if you are using any?

--- 帖子 #753 ---
No These days are not trending days so it s normal we have for many pairs swing across sma....

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Thanks for the confirmation on the trend - was wondering where we are heading to lately - this method teaches me to be patient and to be methodical in approach ( am using both the EA on demo and manual live based on the HFT method)

--- 帖子 #755 ---
can you read / understand english? i already told you this is a trend following method and needs some patience and even in the section of your post where you quoted me you can see me saying that it needs a few months and patience, and you're still pissing and moaning over losses after a few days? total idiot, get off the thread

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Unbelievably rude.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
rude yes, but very deserved. last 5 months of results. note to all the impatient people, this is a TREND FOLLOWING SYSTEM. as you can see in the screenshot below, the *percentage* of winning trades is low. as per original thread starters specifications, many linear small losses, overtaken by a few expotentially profitable gains. but i'll let you judge if this is a system you would like to trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #758 ---
I set the settings to default with everything off, besides 20 break even 2 pip lock in pips. Are these the best settings? what settings did OP run on the demo account?

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Sir, Profit Factor &gt; 2 and DD &lt; 30% that system very good performance. I'll try to run demo and update here.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
This guy contacted me and he told me the settings. can anyone verify the results because i can't run Backtests : Â sma 200, trailingg 10, stop loss -100 &amp; tp 0 # GBP/JPY and GBP/USD 1H time frame. Thanks all for supporting and sharing good information ❤ Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #761 ---
I will go in forward... but trailing stop 10 but what about trailing stop activation? Thanks

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I can forward test it also, what time frame was the backtest? I can try to backtest but I never trust them always seem shitty lol. Also how do you insert a stop loss -100? there is no setting for stop loss, does he mean stop all trades or something?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hi Blamshakk, What settings are you using? Default?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I can't replicate those results, however running a visual backtest the EA seems to only be applying the trailing stop to one position at a time until it is taken out. The other positions are left to run until the other rules close them. Doesn't seem to matter what version I'm using.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Yea same his settings just were on a steady losses and nothing more, again this is why backtesting is utterly trash in metatrader. It's the biggest pile of shit I have ever witnessed. 100 out of 100 people will get different results.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Does this EA have built in slippage settings? if not i think we need an option for this incase a broker goes nuts and has some sort of insane spread amount like 10-50pips.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
What you think guys trading manually this system?

--- 帖子 #768 ---
You can. The folks on the original HFT thread do that. I am in the early days of trading this system manually too.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
How its going? Which pairs you use?

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Am on the major pairs - so far so good - I have begun to realize that you have to take the trades as it goes along and not try to analyze and second guess each one. If its time to get out of the trade, I do so. If it indicates to place a trade, I do so. I'm using the original HFT method and not using any other suggestions made on the thread. It works in keeping the losses linear and the profits exponential and it has helped me keep in check my emotion. Am using the H4 TF. As mentioned by others, it is a trend following system so am giving myself 6mths to a year to see how it plays out.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Thanks wuff, I'll check manually and Ill check daily TF , Do you know what is the reason the 34sma?

--- 帖子 #772 ---
In the original HFT thread Dreamliner says that it does not matter what you use to get into the initial trend - could be a moving average cross or any other method - just that he favours the 34 SMA.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
why not add a news time filter?the EA is not good in News Time.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
After further backtesting, it does seem like the EA is only applying the trailing stop to the last position opened. Using the visual backtest I can see times where it should have closed all the positions by training stop, but it only closes the last one.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I think news affect any EA, if you are in a position at that time the EA don't know about it, I think is a good idea to stop trading on news. But I dont know how to apply that. But if you allready In a position? How you manage that?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
For me I just let it run on (am using it manually) and if it goes against, I change direction. (given that my stop loss has not been hit yet).

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Wuff in the original method, would dreamliner use a stop loss when entering a trade or a trailing stop if i remember correctly?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
He did mention that he would place the initial stop for the first entry either below or above the swing high - then all subsequent entries either place a breakeven stop loss when it has moved as little as 10 pips, or, let it run without stop losses. (initial stop remains) His take was that with a breakeven he keeps the losses minimum, but without a sl he maximizes the trend. Recommendation was to place a breakeven sl if you are new to the game.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
If using the close all profits rules in the EA, when does the EA enter positions again? I see the EA closed a bunch of positions Friday, but has not reentered anything since then?

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Anybody what are the rules for opening new trades once they have all been closed? Does price need to cross the MA again? Or will the EA enter add on positions?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
theoretically it should enter every cross of the 34 SMA either way but in actual fact there are bugs in the re-entry logic in the EA so not every trade is taken

--- 帖子 #782 ---
so basically we are basically relying on random order entry logic? Sometimes it works as intended other times it doesn't? How does this effect the performance I know you have traded it for a little while.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Don't know about the randomness of order entry logic but when I was playing with the EA I noticed that there were times when it took a trade in one direction and then closed it within a few seconds and traded in the opposite direction. Then there were times when it would place two trades at the same entry price one after the other. I suppose these are glitches.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I've seen this too. It appears to be due to bugs in the EA. Entry signals are supposed to be on bar close with actual entry on the next bar open. The only time you'd see an intra-bar close would be if a stop were hit, but even in that case it shouldn't reverse direction.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
I PMd Tarwada if he can post the source code, so we can fix these bugs or pay a developer too.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
I asked several times so I wouldn't hold my breath. I've been working on my own EA just for this reason and I intend to release the source file as soon as it's working.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Great.... thanks for effort Regards

--- 帖子 #788 ---
yea keep us updated, also if you need any help getting other developers i don't mind throwing some money at it.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
thanks please keep us posted. even with the bugs it is definitely profitable, but due to the bugs it is missing some huge trend trades

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hi Tarwada, I'm doing back testing on the V3.5 EA.but so far only GBPJPY result is promising.other pair result is either loss or with little profit. what parameter need to change to suit for other pair ?

--- 帖子 #791 ---
EA seems buggy, run a visual backtest to see what I mean. Higher time frames are better.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Can somebody do me a favor and write all the rules for this EA to be coded properly since OP doesn't want to share source code. Also put in any nice to have features, so it can open trades properly/close/apply trailing stops, ect. And I will try to get it coded. Thanks

--- 帖子 #793 ---
With the help of Desi this is what I have as a spec so far feel free to modify and clarify rules. 1. Open 1 st Trade when crosses Moving Average Settings for period Setting for MA type 2. Additional Trades in direction of MA(above/below) candle closes in red and the close is above the close of the previous candle ( sell if the candle closes in green and the close is below the close of the previous candle ). 3. Money management rules for 1st trade and additional trades: 1st trade has separate settings for B/E, TP/ Stop ect. B/E, T/P, Trailing, Stop Lot size per trade Stop option as Swing High/Low for 1st trade and all other trades 4. Some closing rules Setting for exit all trades on EMA cross opposite direction(true/false) Exit all trades when profit/losses reach X $ amount Exit all trades when profit/loses reach X pip amount Everything is applied to per pair no global account settings. Options are True/False IF exit on MA cross is not enabled, do we take trades in the opposite direction? Or wait for all trades to close?

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Thanks for effort....and if it's possibile if we wanna use it with all apirs could be useful for first time we use Ea put a kind of block for first order if we have to much distance from sma... Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I think i will leave that out, just going to make things more complicated, if you think it's too far disable the EA.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Yes ok no problem take simplest as you can... but could be useful also to avoid orders when we have high volatility moment with really quickly cross ti Ema... I can't wait for your development. Kind Regards Thanks

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I think there is a slippage parameter where don't take trade if slippage is 3pips or something, ect. but volatility last 2 Fridays ago when GBP collapsed did excellent.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Attached is a test EA, it can only be backtested to september 1st, but please test the entry logic/exit logic is correct on smaller time frames

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Any updates on the testing?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Good Job, i'm working on martingale EA and need reference like your ea. Keep updating and live your demo for us.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
[quote=tarwada;8780443]{quote} im running the test on H1 Time Frame apply this settings and/or download the set file below and load it to the EA {image} {file}[/quot Thanks for your excellent job. Dose this SET file can be use for your latest version V3 or 3.5? Why are we not using Trailing Stop to increase the gain? Is there any martingale which could lead to account blow out? No martingale please.

I'll start on monday my forward test.... Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Nice, but with the current bugfull version?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
What bugs did you find? Or are you just going to keep them secret?

--- 帖子 #807 ---
I believe he is talking about the older version by tarwada which is still buggy. I will do the same and start forward testing your revision on my VPS on Monday. But do we have specific settings or pair that works best with this strategy? Due to the load on my VPS I can only run one demo testing, hence I need to know the best settings &amp; pair to start with. Thank you gselsidi12 for your courtesy.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hello Tarwada ... Thanks for your good work and would you please kindly look into this tread and include inside your EA for Entry Signal strategy if possible as propose by the owner? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...72#post8736272 Thanks ...

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Hi, gselsidi, could you, please, explain why it can only be backtested to september 1st? It seems strange to me.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
I'm trying to create a thread however because I'm a junior member I'm unable to do so, however I would appreciate if anyone can help. I'll looking for an EA which will open buy and sell orders when added to the chart (perhaps a script might be easier, I'm not sure), and I want it to create an order for 300 pips either up or down, does anyone have any sources, links or advise, or perhaps an EA which does a similar thing? I would really appreciate it :-) I've already created the start of the script but if anyone has a template which I can modify it would make life easier.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Because I did not pay the dev fully when I pay him completely it will be a full version. If someone can please visually back test the rules and settings on like a 5 min chart to make rules are working correctly. I am extremely busy thank you, also the EA will only run until like Nov 8th or something so please test the logic, thanks.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I don't understand why it should be working only until 8th of November. Do you know why?

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Dude ! Did you hear about some elections in country named USA ? And a guy Trump .... ?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Sorry, my fault I am just the laughing European. It will be interesting to watch the market those days.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
because i did not pay the developer the full amount??? Is anybody going to test this, or should I do it on my own, seems like people just want to use the EA and not help out at all. I'm not asking for money since it cost money to develop it, asking if someone can test the rules, it's not that hard, going to do it myself if no one wants too. 40 Downloads, what is everyone doing with it? sweet talking to it?

--- 帖子 #816 ---
hi just down loaded it , wondering what's the best time frame for this EA. thanks

--- 帖子 #817 ---
I've tried to backest tf 1h geppy and seems lose some orders, close rigtly when closed candle cross sma, but before start open orders in opposite direction... this my 2 cents but i'm not so sure.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hi, I am trying to set this up for testing but dont know where i can add stop loss -100, can you please advise? Thanks

Hello Tarwada, I am running HTF v. 3.5 for 1 week now with 6 charts / 4 h on 24/5 basis, all standard settings: EUR-USD, USD-CAD, USD-YEN, GBP-USD, GBP-YEN, AUD-YEN, Results after 1 week: Deposit: 10 000.00 Closed Trade P/L: -25.67 Floating P/L: 75.18 Equity: 10 049.51 No manual intervention, including news times (Non-Farm payroll). Let's wait for yr Super Election Tuesday. I let it run. and keep on eye on you :-). I hope it remains still free.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
So it did not place order in opposite direction only close it?

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Guys also do we want to wait for bar close? or as soon as price crosses above below MA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Hello all! Just a brief follow up after my message no 819: Closed Trade P/L:-211.84 Floating P/L: 30.74 Balance:9 780.09 Equity:9 810.83 Thus total equity from 10.049.51 down to 9 810.83 after 2 weeks testing. Perhaps the Trump factor? All settings unchanged of course: 4 h , 6 pairs etc.... Now the 3rd week. Happy testing.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Richard, did you trade on US election day by chance? I'm actually surprised how well it did with the markers being all over the place for 3 full days.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hello trustyct! I just left it as it was during the ( very profitable) 1st week. All 5 currency pairs were very probitable but AUD-YEN made a bigger loss. Brought it down the total loss of -211.84 as mentioned. Today (Monday) all 6 pairs are (very) profitable again. Just AUD-YEN made troubles. It's always a problem of setting up a basket. My idea was "follow the sun" ie covering the globe. But I just would like to stick to it for comparison. Perhaps I change it to 1 h (instead of 4h) next week but I am not a fan of shorter periods. Anyway I think it has potential. Monday is very nice again.

--- 帖子 #825 ---

tested DEMO 1 week. Negative result. In live surely higher negative than DEMO

--- 帖子 #832 ---
We need a battery-booster here haha!

--- 帖子 #833 ---
You need more than a week to test the system - its a trend trading system and probably translates to weeks and months .... before you can see any result.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Christmas present attached, has all the options for managing the first entry, and then options for managing other add-on trades, feel free to test it. I ran an optimizer for a whole week, and came up with the best settings, but when i ran those settings on a different broker, it's completely different results, so I don't trust MT very much. On Oanda it's like 200-300% returns with 20% drawdowns On FXchoice the same settings backtested blow out the account I can even forward test it, if someone wants to provide one of the original or modified settings from here, that people used successfully.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Yay! Finally someone releasing actual source code!

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Second upload is OK. Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #842 ---
any results?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
I didn't share the source code with anyone yet..did you just Decoded my EA ?... That's prohibited bro.. Â Im having problems accessing my computer because I've done some hardware modifications and I'm facing some hardware problemsÂ Â Â

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Nah, man. He had someone code up another version. been waiting until new year to try it, having been away recently.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
That would have been cray crazy!! haha

--- 帖子 #846 ---
@tarwada How is going? Did you will release the code? or at least let us know how the ea work? i'm trying it and testing with interesting results but also sometimes dont go good. Sorry for my english

The problem with "Strategy Quant" is that their EA's perform extremely slow in backtesting making it nearly impossible to backtest the EA.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
i will test your EA, thank you

--- 帖子 #851 ---
can u pls share mql file?

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Try using EABuilder (just add .com to the name). I find it works very well with cleaner code than SQ. Creating indicators is FREE and creating unlimited EAs is under a US$100. I don't have any affiliation with them; just like their product. Cheers, .....Sean

--- 帖子 #853 ---
how to change the stop loss ?

--- 帖子 #854 ---
thanks for sharing but is this same QLT V1.57 EA? REGARD

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Logic of the bot is the same. He is probably adding more setting to carbon copy of the EA.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
hello everyone , was trying finding on google but no success. i want Pivot Point EA , there are many ea but not Pivot ea , Rules: 1, Long at support 2, Short at resistance with TP SL trader can put the tp n sl besically pendig orders at 1st support and 1st resistance. 3, switch for 2nd and 3rd s/r if trader want order he/she can change false true for 2nd 3rd also.

Thanks buddy down loaded it going to give it a go regards Terry

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Thank you so much.. I will try to create EA like this

--- 帖子 #865 ---
With the growth of funds, open interest and stop only certainly need to change, as the author recommended 1000 US dollars 0.01 hands, 100 only profit -100 stop loss, you are 3,000 US dollars 0.1 and 0.05, only profit and stop are still 100 and -100?

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Heloo, are you using this EA? I am from today, but I don't know when it takes profit. Do you? That is, with default settings.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Great system.... Is there an indicator to this EA ...that would bring the trader to the table to make a decision....This would assist in filtering out bad trades and get used to the strategy, thereby, making the necessary adjustments to make the EA efficient and accurate. I use multiple TF to trade this system.... Awesome job on the EA.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Hello... Is it possible to get the source code for this EA, I would love to make into an indicator. Greatly appreciated..

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Set allowTrading = false It then will show you all the signals but it WONT open any trades. It will just show/give you the signals You can even get alerts when signals appear if you set sendAlerts=true

Just started back testing this EA. Seems to be working fine with EUR/USD. Which pair &amp; settings combination gives the best result? Does it work with Weekly timeframe?

--- 帖子 #876 ---
I have tested EU/USD with below settings in Test strategy and got around 200% return for entire 2017. I did not extract the report. I will do it in the next post. But it did not work for GPB/JPY as author recommended. Capital - 5700 USD Lot size initial - 35 (Yes i know its huge but it gave ridiculous returns for 2017) Add on lot size - 34 Only long positions - I checked the monthly chart and found that EUR/USD is trending upwards i 2017 - Best net profit around 9000USD Only short positions - Negative net profit Long &amp; Short - 8000 USD (lesser than long only positions) Date range - 1st Jan 2017 till 8th Dec 2017 Rest all default settings Try it out your self

--- 帖子 #877 ---
hi bro i think we can combine this method with fractals for better performance, for ex when market is range. if you dont have time I can help you

--- 帖子 #878 ---
I have some queries regarding EA:- 1) After activating the EA on the chart does the chart consider the time frame on which the EA was placed? 2) Are the entries &amp; exits based on the close/open of the next candle? So nothing happens in between? So if i am using weekly chart any new entries/exits will happen only every week? 3) I know this is a silly question. Do i have to keep logged into MT4 all the time or only when the new candle is formed? In case of weekly chart it will be once a week.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Hi, Just wanted to share my testing results &amp; suggestions for better results. 1) Use either Daily,Weekly or Monthly charts only. But i think this will work with H4 &amp; H1 as well. 2) Combine with Trade Made Simple strategy. Download TDI i.e Trade dynamic index indicator from the thread. Use the TDI cross as suggested in the thread for entries. I tested using EUR/USD on daily charts. I chose only one direction i.e the direction given by TDI. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622 3) Switch off the Auto trading when the TDI line becomes flat as suggested in the thread 4) Look for next entry in another chart.

this is a HA indicator modified with some things I use daily, it works well on all time frames, as you can see the general idea is to use the colors for trend direction, even this mornings news on a 5 min chart at least it gives you the direction to look for a trade. If someone here could put this into an EA so it trades alone so I can sleep...lol it would be great Attached File(s) Heiken_Ashi MA T3 new[Alert].ex4 10 KB | 529 downloads Attached File(s) Heiken_Ashi MA T3 new[Alert].mq4 8 KB | 657 downloads Attached File(s) HA ALERTS TEMPLATE.tpl 24 KB | 599 downloads

a bit more explaining on this indicator...on short term trades when candles pull back into the color and dont go out the other side I enter a trade, if it breaks the other side I look for an opposite trade...the larger the color the better the signal...even small colors are critical just not as strong try it on different time frames Attached Image (click to enlarge)

may the lord be with you in this difficult time

thank you I appreciate that...she has dementia and its been a long 12 years with her and my father both having it..just deal with it day to day I had this EA written about 5 months ago...its a trend EA but has a few cool things it does 1 hidden stop and limit from the broker. 2 it has a 1 trade option, meaning it will not take a new trade unless you allow it to 3 it reads news and has options to trade it during those time or not 4 it lists the news on the chart 5 it has a channel way to enter a trade or with MA Im not going to give a TPL file since its so customizable but I can answer questions if you have them good luck to all..if we can make this better lets do it

Hey hey Tarwada, Glad that you're back. Yes, I have a question. But b4 that can I sincerely say thanks for sharing this EA and all the great work put in. I'm starting to test the EA out to see what's the best ideal settings for great returns... Ok. Here's my question. Pardon me if it may sound noobish or perhaps I had missed out on something... Below was Dreamliner's original thoughts on entering the trade; On my initial entry I usually do not move the stop loss. It stays above the previous swing high or low. Not moving that stop loss allows that initial entry to catch the entire move from top to bottom in a downtrend or bottom to top in an uptrend. My subsequent entries, however, have no initial stop loss . And looking at your EA settings..., is there a feature inside that allows for the 1st initial entry to have a Stop Loss (SL) set as per Dreamliner's parameters? Which is SL is opened automatically but with 'X' pips (that we can input) above the previous swing high or low of that previous candle before the candle that crossed the 34SMA line. I intend to not move the SL too upon the initial entry like how he does it. I personally will also not set any other SL for add-on positions as per Dreamliner's ways though the option is there (available in your EA settings) and one could input if so desire. Thanks in advance for the impending clarification. I am very new to EAs and though my query could be noobish but I hope you could shed some light to it. And if justified..., perhaps the feature could be added in the latest update. Much appreciated... p/s. I had several questions for you in my earlier posts just above of this one. Perhaps you could shed some light into that as well Much thanks. Await your revert p/s/s. Any chance that ur EA can have option to change MA, as in whether we can select Simple MA or even Exponential MA cause I have several MA settings that I frequently use that yields good results. And with this option to select different MAs bodes well for my way of trading. I'm sure others would also desire such an option if it was available

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Here's another query Tarwada. Dreamliner did say he does this at times; " I will sometimes not place the breakevens on the add-ons near the beginning of the trend, and will place them on the add-ons later in the trend, when the price gets quite a ways away from the moving average. " Could we then have an option to include such a setting where say upon a selectable "X" amount of candles heading the right way following the trend (Jetstream) these we can have option to not include SL positions but after these "X" candles amt, the later candles until closed out we can then proceed to set SL positions for fear that the trend is slowly dying off and likely to retrace toward the 34 SMA line and crossing it. With these selectable SL positions we could move SL to BE + spreads to minimise or hv no losses following 1 of the 2 Rules. And whilst the earlier "X" amt candles that we didn't put any SL or SL moved to BE..., they will be the ones that give us the biggest multiple pips count since they started early in the trend until closed out when candle re-crossed the 34SMA line. I am indeed unsure of some settings in the current 3.0 and 3.5 HFT EA and hv no clue how to go abt tinkering with numbers in there. Perhaps what I have been asking here in the last few posts is indeed already in place inside your EA? Bear with me, since I'm kinda noob on EAs as I usually trade manually. Anyway, if you feel that my suggestions warranty valid inclusion into your EA please do so. After all, I really like this EA of yours and would love to see your EA being the most complete EA for HFT methodology. No better feeling to give birth to a wonderful EA that is complete, versatile and powerful... Thanks once again for the unselfish work and time

the HFT EA is one of the best EA so far i have tested changed the settings file and it is giving very good results

--- 帖子 #920 ---

You said you use HFT EA. In your template it isn't this EA but EA from the user Pipster 59. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #926 ---
i am testing out both the EAs what do you want ? there is no template for HFT EA - i am testing EA 3.5 whose settings are already displayed in the above post

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Ok no problem. I just thought that you uploaded template for HFT EA because you said that the HFT EA is the best you tested so far and Pipster59 asked you about template for that EA and than you uploaded template. So because of that I thought it's a template for FHT.

Hi guys, I am a newbie for trading. I would like expert like you to guide me on how to install the HFT EA which I downloaded and intent to put in my experts folder inside my metatrader folder. When I enabled the ea for one of the pair and click auto trading. Only a smiley face appeared. What should I do next since I work at home so I have ample of time to monitor the progress manually. Could you provide a guide for me for people who are new to trading and would like to make profit from it? Many thanks!

What are these errors and why does it keeps closing my trades right after it opens?

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Hello All, I have downloaded this EA version 3.5 to run on my MT4, I did not change anything yet in the settings, I have only dropped it on the EURUSD chart of my demo account of 1 minute, I choose the 1 minute chart simply to see if trades are being opened, I am not interest in profit right now. Nothing happens, after 6 hours running, not a single trade opened. I drew a 34 SMA on the chart that is all I did. Do I need to do anything else to make this work? Thanks Nic

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Update... looks like that it's the pair EURUSD that does not work, I switched chart and went to EURGBP and and it started to open trades, when all trades were closed I switched to GBPUSD and also there it worked, I than went back to EURUSD and it did not open any trades. Any ideas?

Pls help me to add push notification for my wave entry mq4

Hello Tarwada Good to see you back will you please be kind and share the source code and the project file of the EA as you promised. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Hi All , i want to ask is this EA there a Expired date ?

--- 帖子 #942 ---
This project has clearly been abandoned and I'm not surprised. The programming of this EA is disgustingly bad. You can see that by just looking at the settings. It doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi I have hft ea latest version but loose of any pairs... I don't know what is the reason....

The idea about this EA isn't too bad to be honest. I have a EA that trades in a similar way but you need to define the trend in a more clever way. The model works better if you buy on dips in the direction of the SMA with a bigger size and you need to keep the trades to around 6 Max. SMA's work, EMA's don't in EA's. The SMA needs to be Optimized per pair and per time frame only over a twevle month period. My Model works on around 18 pairs on many time frames. Just as a guide, EURCAD H4 50SMA - EURCAD Day - 54SMA USDCHF H1 21SMA - USDCHF H4 - 60SMA You make your money by accumulating pips over many charts, about 48 charts on one account with my EA " MET "

--- 帖子 #946 ---
I don't get why SMA works and EMA doesn't work? Could you please clarify if you can? I have the same issue to define the trend and thinking about these 2 options. Cheers

--- 帖子 #947 ---
That is a question I haven't yet worked out totally but here is my answer. When you trade manually and make decisions by looking at the last bar and a EMA, you factor in the last or most recent movement before taking the trade. So you are only trading whats happening over the last week or so and maybe trading against the long term correct moves. When you trade with EA that is Optimized over a couple of years with a SMA, the trade is based on the probability that the moves will repeat again so therefore will become profitable sometime soon in a week or two. Over a couple of years the Long term view of a SMA wins. I have two EA models that use SMA's and are profitable. I can't get a EMA model to work. I define a Buy Trend in code talk ( Say 50 SMA )- If bar 50 SMA Shift 1 is greater than bar 50 SMA shift 2 If bar 50 SMA Shift 2 is greater than bar 50 SMA shift 3 If bar 50 SMA Shift 3 is greater than bar 50 SMA shift 4 BUY

Hi everyone! This Post is the last for many months now. The question for Tarwada is: How have you gone with this EA in your real account? . I see it very well, even if you have to "spend a lot of fuel before taking off", but when it reaches cruising speed everything is excellent. Thks.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
hello. i'm going to be honest now. don't use it on real account. i couldn't find a good settings for this EA. also, i'm working on my own system. if someone figured out a good settings for it please PM me so i can post it on the first page. thanks all &lt;3

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Hi Tarwada, It seems that you have abandon this HFT EA since there's no good settings that can be found to trade consistently and profitably in the long run... Are you going to be sharing the source file by any chance because in one of your earlier post not too far back you announced be sharing the source code out and the details of the projects. I would very much like to continue on with this Project and if you are ok with it..., can you send me the source file. Thanks so much... Cheers p/s. 1 [+] You can Change the Period of the SMA . This was what was programmed? Can we change to 34 Smoothed MA instead of using 34 Simple MA? Would love to have this as 34 Smoothed MA cause the results matter significantly... p/s. 2 BTW please check your Forex Factory email/messages as I've sent you a message there. Thanks

Dear your EA not taking any trade. Please provide update versio, thnaks.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Hey Tarwada, I have a question for you !! I saw your post on another forum 29/09/2015 (# 133069) developing Ea Renko, did you manage to execute it? could open a new discussion here about Ea with Renko's chart. However, if anyone has any Ea to run on the Renko chart and can share it here, I would be very grateful. I have been practicing with Renko graphics. My idea would be simplicity. To start with it is a strategy that would be just BB and MM. John

I find it very interesting

Wow, hope you did not put a whole lot of time in this.

I'm a few years late to the party but i appreciate you making this EA! i've been back testing for a few weeks with various pairs and i think i got some constancy. id what everyone in the comments are talking about. its a free EA that requires a bit of tuning.
