This thread is just a continuation of my previous work. Can we be profitable if we just enter in the market randomly without any extensive training on forex or fundamental / technical knowledge or knowing nothing about Macro/Micro economy? Disclaimer: I used to get feedback that my contents are commercial or rather close to commercial. I used to defend that saying unless you are close to me I am not going to share actual files for free. This time I would like to start the thread with a file. If you are using it - facing trouble - you are welcome to post here. As per my past experience, I used to get lot of PMs but not a lot thread replies. I would encourage to participate and share your story without hurting each other. Let's see how we can participate in this 'Walk a Thon' and help each other more RekonX update File is removed, message me for any detail. Note: You may find other downloadable files on various pages,but those are just interim versions. So dont waste your time downloading them again, Just use the version from this post,where time to time I will upload the latest version and you will be fine to use them. Summary of Trading Strategy (You may save time here too and no need to browse through all the pages to get the summary ) A) Instrument: any USD pairs, I would prefer EUR USD, GBP USD B) Time Frame: H4 chart C) Installation: Just put the RekonX folder in Experts folder and use the EA from there. D) Method: Trend &amp; Price Actions, we will still call the trade entry random as EA wouldnot know whether this is the 100% best trade entry for profit or not. E) Trend: Identify Short / Long term trend and set trade direction eg. 5MA is lower than 40 MA so trade direction is sell, MAs used - 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160, there could be 7*7 different scenarios on detecting the present H4 trend. F) Price Actions: All major price actions for With Trend or Contra Entries,read the thread to know more G) Market Volume: It plays a crusial role, so we detect whether based on previous candle volume (Tick) we should trade now (current H4) or not H) Candle Volume: Whether present candle is already overbought or oversold I) Trade Time: 4,6, 8,10, 12,14, 16,18, 20,22 - these are the trading hours - but still you apply the EA on a H4 chart for better reading of indicator data J) Entry &amp; Exit: Only enters when Trade Time Matches and can open-close multiple positions if H-Candle Volume and G- market Vol and F- PA and E-Trend permits, Exit is fixed at $10. K) Do not Trade: 1. if trade hour is not in I) Trade Time 2. Last candle volume was beyond average trading range 3. Price is in Supply or Demand Zone 4. Present Candle length is beyond average Candle range Past work Expert Advisor which can survive for more than a year!

So,the first file which you can download is - RekonX-AutoBots.ex5 for MT5 platform. It is running fine at my system, you may get some error messages due to various libraries I have used. I can upload them too with my assumption, but I would like to see you using it -learning it and posting back. So at the moment I just wait.

Random Walk Theory Explain I know nothing about the place but I have to go somewhere where I can feel comfortable. With this feeling, I start with a free mind. I go in a direction which suits me, I step back and change my direction if it does not. I take my time, I wait, then I start again. How my trading is related to Random Walk? Think about it. A simple step on trading fx would be loading money into your broker account and placing a 'Buy' / 'Sell' spot or pending order. So, here also we are going to do the same thing (may be, please do not offend because you are a pro trader and spends several hours to hone your fx skills by learning and knowing lot of micro things ) We would wait and decide where to go -&gt; Buy is first or Sell is first. Is it contradictory? If we decide first then how come it is random? So, it is gentle walk - not running or jumping or going heyward. We are not going to do a spot entry. Rather EA will first check the short term trend (5 Minutes) and then place a trade

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Trade Entries A) BUY when 2 MA is up on 5 MA on 5 Mins TF - Pending BUY Orders (BUY STOP, BUY LIMIT) - Entry points are precoded in the EA with 0.01 lot A) SELL when 2 MA is down on 5 MA on 5 Mins TF - Pending SELL Orders (SELL STOP, SELL LIMIT) - Entry points are precoded in the EA with 0.01 lot

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Closing the trades EA is going to open multiple positions for the active instrument, increase lot size automatically and close all positions for USD 2 overall profit.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
You can call it random walk, but It's just 2 ma's And it kills you with range

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Here is the EURUSD M5 chart where the EA is running all day long. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
May be true - a super volume on the market will make it fail - but it will still save you because it is going to wait and check trade direction on regular interval and secondly,it is going to close all your open positions with minimal profit.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
This snap is showing the trade intervals and direction change with profit on each position. But, remember EA closes all positions &gt;= 2 USD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi is it work for mt4?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Sorry, I have not converted the script for MT4, this works only on MT5.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I do have received lot of request for MT4, but I think sooner or later people will use MT5 and above. Although, MT4 is maintaining its individuality but I think this is because lot of work has already done on MT4 and people used to MT4 do not want MT5. If we get this EA capable of providing consistent profit, then I may code it for MT4 in future.

You may note down the In and Out ---&gt; It opens multiple positions (Action - In), it resize the lots, it closes all positions with USD 2 profit (Action -Out). How it is managing your equity with multiple positions and how it is increasing your equity by closing all in profit.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
EA Strategy One more thing you are going to notice by reviewing the orders - There are Multiple EAs within one EA to place your orders as per situation. So yes, it starts with a simple 2 MA entry but then goes beyond. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #16 ---
What is fixed sl? When I backtest the expert I see not closed trades with -50-100-... pips

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Each position opens with 100 pips SL and TP fixed, All positions get closed if floating PL is 100 USD, it opens max 15 positions in both directions, as per present trend, could be 10 buy with 0.50 lot, 5 sell with 0.50 lot for example. There is a lot balancing strategy too, will explain later. I will publish my back testing result and explain. However, my personal take on back testing is it never assures actual result what you are going to get from market.

Trade Rules # 2 * Per instrument per position either buy or sell - EA is going to open up max 10 positions in regular interval (say 1 hour - these hours can also be modified, eg, you make EA trade only those hours in which you are comfortable and exclude those hours which you do not. * EA is going to increase lot size upto 10% from 0.01 standard lot. * EA aim for closing all positions if Total Profit is &gt;$2 * In case Total Profit is in loss - then EA closes single positions with profit &gt;$3, and opens fresh positions * Each position has SL, TP 100 pips * Trailing stops also starts on each position

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Cool, I see the same progress with AUDUSD But I got margin call backtesting this strategy with 2018 data - so EA doesn't close all positions with total loss &gt;$3 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Back testing is not a proven approach. Otherwise, you would have bunch of systems working absolutely fine giving you desired profit always. But, we both know this is not the case. I would suggest run the EA on demo account to see how it is working instead using strategy tester for back testing. I can optimize the result in back testing and give you absolutely perfect system. But in reality it would prone to fail. I give you one pure Data Science example. Training and Testing of data. If you know about predictive modelling, you would know - model accuracy improvement is not correlated to success of the model on Test data. So you train, train, train --- improve accuracy of the prediction on training data but as soon as a new feature is introduced your model is going to struggle.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
What I meant is, in Machine Learning term it is called 'Feature Extraction'. The more your model able to do quality extraction of feature the more success in predicting the future it will have, thus, we, human will get benefit out of it. Below is a screenshot of Macro Economy data, if you know how to read it and execute it in your trading you will be in Top 10% of Fx traders. Same goes for the EA / Model - if it knows how to interpret and use the data - the ratio of unsuccessful traders would decrease till a complete new feature is getting introduced in the market.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Random walk - random trend, how you can be profitable if you follow complete uncertainty? Y(t+1)=Y(t)+error which is normally distributed with 0 expected value. Just sum all future errors - e1+e2+e3, according the low of large numbers their sum is 0. It means that your expected profit is 0*all lots sizes = 0. With broker charges your expected profit is negative. Simple proof you're wrong.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Yes, randomness with complete zero memory would be a 'chicken-walk' so totally agree on the point. Here the EA do walk with a 'short-term' memory so if it is not comfortable and losing, it changes trade direction with assumption that next trade will be in profit.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Rekon, I'm math and you are right absolutely. I just ask you about fixed SL=&gt;$3. Why it doesn't work in the tester?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
is this EA written just for pure technical content? what else feature does it have.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Why it is not working in test, there could be multiple reason - the EA considers trading hours from the time of activation, before executing trade it refers the trade hours this feature does not work with past data, so with past data reference for opening a trade it may take incorrectly. Secondly,it compares with active positions, how long those are active. Should it close the old position first - it tries to find out those answers? Which is again does not work well with past data. If your data has any gap then also it will fail in back testing. That is why the best way to test it by running it on a demo account - keep it live and check the result. Question why it took this trade, why it closed that trade etc. Post the finding here for betterment.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I released it with some basic feature, the original version is too complicated so I have to shut that down. Here, it has a short term memory to execute trade - that is ofcourse not a perfect approach, but it takes simple steps to solve trading fx. I have already posted few action which it does. I will share more details later.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
What I meant is, to improve the tool, we need to supervise it closely. Can it satisfy us while answering the below questions for example. If not, then we should contribute to make it enable answering these questions. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is the snap of live trading before market open - it worked 48 hours, closed 28 Buys and 25 Sales with 0.57 lot trading and $36.30 profit. The positions remained open 4 sales with 0.07 lot and 7 buys with 0.07 lots. So, it is doing a lot balancing to save the equity. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Wow! ((( mega SL with micro TP????

--- 帖子 #41 ---
how many positions are closed?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I do agree, it does not look good with mega SL and micro TP, risk reward is screwed up...but here we are targetting to open and close multiple positions which are genered randomly.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
why it is needed to trade randomly, when we can wait for a good trade set up, and execute trade with good risk reward like 20:100 or 50:100 so on? Absolutely we can, in that case we could have 2-3 opportunity weekly on a single pair to do so. Why this randomness is useful? I tell you my story. My real accounts are tagged with rebate agents. What does it mean, the more i trade I get additional dollar from them. So if able to do 100 trades with losing 2% of my account equty, i will be earning atleast 5% from the rebate agent. Hence, EA with handsome trading capability will be very effective here.

Open trades - 4 buy with 0.04 lots, 6 sell with 0.08 lots - Negative Equity 0.07% Profit as of now ( 3rd day) 11.43 %

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here is one more analysis to understand lot balancing - So far -it has used lots -0.01, 0.03 and 0.04 - this EA is not going to increase the lots more than 0.04 for a single trade - this is just a precausion to save account equity. It increases when it has a bandwidth upto 0.10 lots in total. Remember I told about one EA containing multiple EAs it means there are multiple strategies to overcome a situation when the EA is not able to close all trades in &gt;2 USD profit. - 0.01 is Strategy one -0.01 is strategy two -0.03 is strategy three - 0.04 is strategy four Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
If you look at the trade history - You will get lot of positions are getting closed with &gt;3 USD profit - because most of the time EA will not be able to close all positions in USD 2 profit. Why so? If we try to attempt that - only closing when we have overall profit - we have to increase lot size infinite times which will result margin call on equity. Thus, this is my attempt to address this particular issue in a very conservative way. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
What best we can do when we have a stelmate situation - which means open positions are not getting closed by EA for long time and we are not having trade done by EA? Could be - positions with negative 100 USD will get closed first and new position will be freed up for EA to trade. By that time how much it has profited that will be a consideration point. Any better thought on this?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hour 23 and Zero (24| 0) are excluded to perform any action, so if your positions are in profit &gt;3, EA is not going to close them.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
12.92 % profit as of now with 0.06% negative positions - 5 Buy (0.05 lot) ans 5 sell (0.08 lot) open

--- 帖子 #53 ---
One notable point from trade history is - EA should be able to dynamically adjust TP/SL for old positions. May be in next release I will add this feature.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Well my result is rather poor today (((( Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
My open positions are also not good Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Well probably today is not a lucky day for this system... Let's see....

--- 帖子 #57 ---
See, lets not put it in multiple pairs on same platform. I tried this early and failed. Why because the conservative approach of securing your equity is lost. The more you add pairs the more vulnarability comes. I have shown on a single pair EUR USD, you may definitely try with other USD pairs, but just dont put this on multiple charts. Lets not make it complicated please. If it able to give to some % of profit, then we will see how to increase it in future. Follow a gentle walk, no rush, no run.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
on your trade history i see lot positions are opened &gt;0.04, EA is limited to open trades upto 0.04 so I am little confused how come greater lots are opened. I hope you have not opened them manually.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Works perfectly for me. Just one pair GU. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
nice, GU is my best pair too.

Can we test it on exotic pairs like USDZAR? The movement over there is insane so it might be worth testing. Do let me know your thoughts!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Well, good result for today. Actually I think that it woulb be better but my daugher turned off the computer for 5 minutes))))

--- 帖子 #65 ---
If I open 3 different pairs, is the EA trading them independently? I don't see Magic number or anything would help in order to find out best pairs to trade with this system

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Yes, there is no magic number.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I would say "yes",but you need to let it run on a single chart, no parallel run for now.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Good then Looks autotrading is OFF, but I like that you are running it on Single window.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Run it on different account, otherwise result may be bad even if you get some short term advantages.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Any plan to enable multiple pairs support?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
It has magic numbers - initial pending orders with "Expert", later spot trades with lot increment "Expert1" but it can be instrument specific too. For now that feature is disabled. As I said earlier, I have released a simple version to work on few core issues which are critical but missed in RekonX original version.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
So question is, in order to understand, what I need to test as I'm keen to help

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yes, but it is not critical at the moment. I would rather interested to see questions coming up on the trades it is placing for a single instrument and by next quarter how many essential features we can include, how much performance is improved for this version etc.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Good to know and welcome As we are having a slow pace of development cycle here, I would appreciate constructive discussion and pointers on trades -for example what could have been better for the EA to trade on various situations? A) Situation A - comparing last 15 mins Tick Volume it is noticed that VOL has increased x% or decreased x% - What should be action items for the EA?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Ok, perfect then, I will let it run for a while to be able to see how it performs, I will focus on unnecesary trades.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Try to see if you can make it based on candle size and try to see when a certain sequence appears eveytime, how the market reacts.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Here is a snap on trading strategies present on the release version, different trading approaches within the same limitation on total open positions and max lot - can be applied, presently it is just executing trades based on 2/5 MA on M5. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I have talked about 'StaleMate' situation when EA will not be able to perform - because of conservative approach is applied - for example more than 10 open positions which it is not able to close so can't trade new.To trade fresh it needs to free up space. How it can be done? Which approach now is going to make the EA take another random entry by killing one position or so and making it favourable for itself? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Before killing a open position in loss,it should be able to get trade confirmation on upcoming trading opportunity.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Today during news, it closed all positions before them (Just lucky one move in the good direction) HOWEVER, it then opene 2 positions of 0.05 lots? Why? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Few updates on the EA: A) Check for old positions to close when total open positions are exceded max limit eg.10. B) Open a new position with CCI validation Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I assume it opened those - spot orders when there was zero open position. EA can take 0.05 as MAX when there is no position, otherwise it will take lot between 0.01 to 0.04.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
With this new logic EA is going to close old positions with minimal profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

5th Day - 15.45 % profit as of now with 5.87% negative positions - 4 Buy (0.04 lot) and 4 sell (0.07 lot) open

Hey if you need help to convert it to mt4. I am happy to help my friend.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
It would be great.

Installed it on VPS today. EU let's see.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Setting up bigger position for the same reward is a nonsense, the potential drawdown that this is generating is not worth it, I think the EA Does perfectly fine with 0.01 positions

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Agree, will fix it.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I am not sure, there are freelance coder or software is available. Please Google.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
This EA is not yet ready for Mass, let us see this for couple of months more.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Can you describe your trading rules in a complete way? please.many thanks.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
It checks 2 vs 5 MA on M5 timeframe and place trades. Next, bunch of other rules to make that trade entry profitable, saving equity, do more trades etc.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Is my understanding correct? 1. Buy when 2MA up cross 5MA, Sell when 2MA down cross down 2. Basic Lots=0.01, SL and TP 100 pips. 3. Next Buy|Sell when 2MA cross 5MA, Lot=1.1*Basic Lots, SL&amp;amp;TP=100pips. 4. All positions Max=15. 5. Close all position when Total profit&gt;=2$. 6. Close single position when Total profit&lt;0 &amp;amp; single position profit&gt;3$. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes, you got the flow mostly correct. Max open position size is 10. lots can be 0.01, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05, depends on situation

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Note: Single position closing starts when you have 6 positions opened and overall in loss.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
6th Day - 22.52 % profit as of now with 11.91% negative positions - 14 Buy (0.14 lot) and 0 sell (0.00 lot) open

--- 帖子 #100 ---
#Update 3 Trailing Stop is enabled Lot size max is capped at 0.04 Open positions can go upto 15, +5 positions are just to recover from stalemate situations - with CCI filter added Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #101 ---
When the account negative is more then 10% ... EA should start applying a different strategy to close each negative position with a positive trade, however, this needs to be treated unique and should be again put on sleep as soon as account negative is less than 10%.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
To do that - we need to identify a negative position for closing and a trade set up for new trade with greater lot than the target close. Although no gurantee whether this will turn good or bad.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
It has to target a particular trading hour say UK session to do so.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Did you updated the EA? Or could you upload the new version?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Well, the result for today is rathe poor... opened positions are -89 for now and closed positions are +24

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I am planning to release the updated version on Oct 1st.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Yes, this is due to lack of defencing strategy for the EA, caught up with open positions. It will be tricky to have a counter strategy on this situation, but you may have noticed, i am already working on this. Do come up with your theory what EA should have done here for better result.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
The snap here showing clear failure to handle the scenarios - with a powerful downtrend the EA is ended up with 17 Open positions with 0.20 lots. There is no counter strategy activated yet to cutdown losing positions and free up trading margins. In next few days I will try to address this issue. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
One of the root cause of error is - multiple positions opened in almost same price - it means there was not much volume in the market when those positions got opened. Therefore, one validation needs to be applied - not to open a trade within 20 pips range if that zone is already having an open position.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
One more error - and this is only applicable to this R&amp;D version of EA is- it has done few incorrect trailing and closed positions in negative. This is now corrected. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Today results for this system on VPS. Not good

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Dont know what happened there. I have 51$ closed and -48$ open positions.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
You could reverse the logic and make an insane amount of pips!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I'm not going to earn any money with this strategy. Just curious about how much time it will survive.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
This EA is in development process and is not supposed to earn you any real money in this stage, I mean you should test on demo, and it's still in profit,even with DD..

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I hope that this very EA will go on living and I really wish that it will happen. But my life experience tells me that it is almoste impossible (for this EA with this very DD) the DD is almost 10:1

--- 帖子 #117 ---
It's not my logic.... so I just follow it... I follow it in this very thread.... and according to this logic the result is like this((((

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I would say it is not bad either, but yes, I see the opened positions were not correctly done by the EA, so last 2 days were challanging enough to provoke our thought process.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Ah...may be not that simple. Yes, one alert and dare person could earn insane profit by exploiting market condition. EU generally goes on sell till october end then buy starts till Dec 20th, post that till jan 10th it is better to stay away, then it takes another major direction for the year. As per this EA, no one can earn insane profit, because it is going to cut the profitable positions very soon. On a ranging market with moderate volume it can do well

--- 帖子 #121 ---
This is not released for earning lot of money, but still it can, I think it is going to survive, although logic wise it is not perfect yet. Please keep watching this place for EA updates, will release better version soon. And that is the primary objective. Do not get hurt with real accounts, that will be risk but if you want to take little risk it is alright.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Correctly said. Well done. See, we need to look at this as investment for future so you are welcome to contribute by your time and thought. If you are using this in Real account you are taking risk ofcourse but then whatever is the reward the profit that is also going to you.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yes opening regular positions at same price zone is a problem. We will fix this by next release.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I agree, so it needs improvement.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
This EA is basically cuting the winners to let the losers run, acumulates a huge drawdown on trending market as it is going to cut every position in the direction of the trend with small profits while its is going to let the positions that are totally opposite run until they are in heavy loss, will work pretty decent on a ranging market though. I think you should change the logic of the EA to work in the opposite way, cut the positions that are in a loss and average up in the positions that are in profit, with this poor MM it is impossible it can succeed in the long run, you have 10:1 RR I don't even want to know what % of succeed trades you need to be profitable with such RR.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Actually reversing logic would be a nice experience too

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Correct, but even we change the complete logic, there is no evidence that it is going to run fine and ensure absolute safe trading. EA started with random ness, we noticed it works good in a situation but prone to fail when the situation changes. Task is to incorporate those features and increase EA s memory to handle various market conditions. I never mentioned the released EA is having some holi grail of winning market, sustaining in the market is the experience of sensing the up coming situation and acting on it. Lets see how it can be done. Strategy wise there will be updates.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
It looks like that because we are only cutting the winning positions and keeping the losing posions opened. For each losing position EA should try to open a new trade that was my initial thought, but to do so it may add more risk to equity. So, it needs to be resolved before EA opens multiple entries and make it unmanageble.

This is the backtest result coming from the interim version. It worked for the entire 2018 with only 500 dollar - with net profit 124 dollar, please mind for this EA profit is not important rather surviving is important. Drawdown is about 13.61% which is fare enough. It has performed 3898 trads Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #130 ---
So, the initial questions remains same - with random entries it is getting almost same result for winning or losing trades in both directions but still able to survive for 9 months without any supporting strategies for better entry and exit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Next update of this EA will be released by this Thursday. So, you are welcome to post your observations. Here, objective is to focus on a much better entry point instead of 2/5 MA on M5 it rather checks MA trend of 5,10,20,50,100 and 200 on H1 along with momentum for volume, therefore, we are not going to get frequent trades.

Hi Rekon, Sorry but I have added this EA to my MT5 but there is missing some Inputs/config tab for this EA? It seems that there is missing some files in proper folder?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Is this the case with the version uploaded on page one? Remove everything related to previous version and freshly install the updated file/folder. You need not to provide any additional input, once successful installation the info panel should be able to show trade information and EA should be able to trade.

Here is an open question to all. I would like to add one more condition in the EA trading strategy, if the present candlesize (High - Low) is X then stop trading. Question is what would be the X and what is the best way to calculate the X?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
ATR?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
ATR for what range? How many candles?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
20 days ATR seems reasonable, but im not an expert and i dont even use indicators for trading

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thats fair enough, why this is important - to filter out unnecessary trades which may occur after successful closing of first/second trade within the H4 - to stop the EA trading unnecessarily.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
"unncessary" trades can bring profit, or loss. Everything needs to be backtested properly before doing any changes in my opinion

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Yes you can It is about minimizing Risk. So,I am not thinking about maximizing profit for this project. My criteria will be how many time it tried trading, out of which how many times it succeded. How much we can profit with this that may be a second phase of work.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
What im saying is adding ATR filter can cause more loss, or more profit but we dont know it because it needs to be backtested. ATR filter is very logical, but the market is not driven by logic. Sorry if you misunderstood me, im not a native english speaker so yeah.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Sure. We are already using technical indicators -we know they are good for certain conditions - as soon as conditions changes these indicators start failing. So, here, essentially we have been trying to detect the changes in market conditions. Why measuring the candle length is important, so that we do not over do trading on that and exit or pass safely instead of getting caught.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Then 20 day ATR will work fine.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi Rekon, I was testing the previous EA and the DD was higher than the profit. Will test the new one and see how it goes. I have downloaded the zip file and there are a few mqh files. Do I need to include it in MT5? I'm new to using MT5. There are no input when attaching EA to chart. Is it built that way?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Yes the folder needs to be placed on Experts folder of MT5, EA will be using those libraries

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes, Inputs are frozen for now, not customizable.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Ex5 goes to expert. What about the mqh?

none. There will be only one position. Read the thread about updates. In case of trade direction change - old position will be closed before opening a new one. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
If you have followed so far, the beauty is - people could have closed the last position ref post #187 in loss, but EA hold the position and exited with $10 profit.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
The reason of holding is - it now understands the trend directions, although it was a wrong entry on oversold candle. This issue is also fixed.

Yes, last EA from your first page with the folder, in Expert. No error, just no trade

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hmm... my last update was this monday morning if I am not wrong, so yes it should have traded - I hope your system is on always or have you deployed in any virtual server? I got 3 trades this week. Maximum trade it can do 5 times in a day on 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours. It can do multiple trades on each H4 provided there is no open positions and candle is not over bought or sold. I am concluding that - you should try that on your personal system and check for any error.

Well, I was saying no order on backtest!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Looks peculier - how long it took for back testing? I would not prefer the strategy tester for this - because the method is pretty proactive - so may be it will work good on Demo account with real price instead of historical data.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Agree, it is just a math to label it "over bought" or "over sold". Idea is just to stay away from trading in such conditions.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
My advice is to stay away from it completely. Best trends develop in overbought/oversold conditions. If you want to improve your EA, then stay away from basic indicators and concentrate on breakouts/retraces Best wishes

Yes, it would need some more scenarios to observe with present settings. Good advice BTW

--- 帖子 #230 ---
About Exit - the strategy is - If we get a confirm with support from other trade conditions such as - Trade Time, Candle Length, Market Volume - we close the open position with loss and take a fresh trade. So, if my open position is sell is negative and EA gets a Buy signal with all trade conditions positive then it closes the sell and opens a BUY. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Presently there are two situations for EXIT. A) As soon as Price Action/Trade Direction changes - EXIT the open Negative Position. B) When there is a confirm signal on Opposite trade, then EXIT the open Negative Position. With A - Pros are - Loss will be minimum - Quick exit,no need to hold the posiion for long With A - Cons are - You may get frequent STOPOUTs - You may get FALSE Alarms more - You win rate% is going to go down as it may close lot of positions in Loss With B - Pros are - Less False Alarms, so it is going to HOLD the position unless ALL conditions of opposite trade is confirmed - Win Rate % will be higher With B - Cons are - You may get a BIG LOSS by the time it is confirmed an oppositite trade Presently EA is following the EXIT Stretegy B, do share your thoughts on the same. Cheers!

Demand Zone Scenario ~ Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I am pretty happy with the EA performance so far. We had a tough situation when EA took a wrong entry at Demand zone but it is able to come out from that because it was a "With Trend" entry. I could have closed the position knowing it is wrong and it happened because I also changed trade frequency from 5 to 10 times! Just doubled it to throw more challange on EA. It has handled all challanges beautifully. That is what we call "Machine Learning". But yes it still has no memory on its own and just performing all actions with boundary defined. But, that's good. We know as a human being we will never be be to take decission like EA does and we will never be able to keep our nerve strong when we know there is a mistake.

Trade direction has changed to "BUY", no open position at the moment. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Explanation Trade direction changed from "Sale" to "Buy" - thats is why the existing position on sales got close. After closing the position, as per trade condition it opened one buy @ 0.15 lot. As per the normal trade condition it opened another buy @ 0.15 lot. So whenever, trade direction changes and EA closes one opposite position,it is going to open 2 positions as per present trade direction. As soon as both positions reached $10 - both were closed.

To take a 90%+ sure shot on counter entry - only demand/supply zone is not enough. We need to identify a reversal pattern, which may need sometime only one candle, sometimes two previous or three previous candles.

i think if we can achieve 90+% winrate with trend following trade, then it doesn't matter if we can not catch the reversal trade

The updated version on Page One is going to stay for one week. Post that I will be removing the file but you can still post your findings here. I will be engaged in other activities so I will be less active here. I have couple of more features to enhance the EA on my mind, specially on Trend &amp; Price action entries and optimizing the Exits. I will continue working on them and will share my results. This thread I started with only one objective, to put aditional challanges on my scripting abilities, take direct feedback from mass and implement them quickly. I do not have any pending requests at the moment and scripted few requests which came from this thread so thanks to all who contributed by posting here. Sharing is fun. Keep Safe. Happy Holidays in advance
