This thread is for students from Skunny's Thread who wish to walk the fibs on 5 min and 15 min charts of USDJPY, GBPJPY and GBPUSD. I will be using a simplified fib tool that has been called IFibs and will keep updated active charts throughout the European Session and hope that the others that join me will update the US and Asian Session. For those that are not familiar with Skunny's thread - here's the link: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=60272 and also Bobokus's Thread from which compliments Skunny's: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=50767 Thanks to both for their hard work and for sharing with all of us here in FF. All the answers about this methodogy are found in those threads, so please do your homework before asking basic questions - and lets also please keep negative posts and ones about other ideas off the thread - thanks. So lets continue our journey and hope that we might catch sight of the Moley Quail..... Islander. Edit:Three months on and I realise that I made some incorrect assumptions and that it is more accurate to say that Bobokus is the Master Teacher - and a VERY experienced trader. Skunny learned from Bo as his "pupil" and has his own cryptic ideas. The ideas in this thread owe far more to Bo than Skunny - plus some ideas of my own. Aptil 2009 I'm posting here again - although now mainly on GBPUSD - aka cable. Also, I've added the Sweet Spots - aka physc levels - and also daily pivots as this is the way I now trade. The indicator window is NOT an indicator - its Volume - the vital part of trading that few know about or use - check here if you want more info: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=157629

After the lower highs on Friday and yesterday showed weakness off the 15m charts we got the sell off after the Frankfurt Open....

--- 帖子 #3 ---
As cable had been sideways during the early part of the Asian Session - Japan has another holiday! - GJ was following UJ's fall. Once GJ failed to rally out of the top of the DZ on the 5m chart,there were several opportunities to sell on the exit from the lower edge of the DZ or as price bounced down off it. That fall was finally some 230 pips from the bottom of the DZ! That's a nice start to the week - and the thread! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I've been watching the I-Fibs since their introduction in Skunny's thread. I really like the way you've applied the DecisionZone and combined that with watching the base pairs (USDJPY &amp; GBPUSD) for GBPJPY. This is good stuff for beginners as well as advanced traders. I'll be following closely. Great trade this morning! This is the real deal. MB

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Just to complete the picture - looks like a fakeout at the Frankfurt Open....

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks MB for your support. I find it helpful to keep an eye on the base pairs to see which is behind GJs move and its possible targets - and sometimes, when the base pairs are moving in opposite directions, GJ will go sideways. Then trading one of the base pairs is more profitable.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Congrats Islander, Great job getting the I-fibs thread going, looking forward to it.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Izzy Do you want us to set up our charts like yours, or does it matter?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Now lets see if we get the retrace.....I could be early walking the fib, but I would not want to chase a push below 206.80 until we see a bounce. So far we have a European Range of 194 pips and that's around the average for the whole session, so caution is now in order.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi GM - thanks for popping in - please use what ever you're happy with - mine are KISSified to help me trade http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Issy

Thanks Pip - and I'm looking forward to your contributions... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

Arrrrrrg! I can only idly watch you guys make money as FXCM is having technichal difficulties. I was short on GBP/JPY on the breakout of the range but had to exit prematurely due to platform problems. I was also short GBP/USD but again, only 16 pips due to platform problems. At least I got out safely though. I would place an order and it wouldn't register for 10 min! At least when it did it was filled where I placed it. Strange, FXCM has been great and I have never had this problem in the past.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Oh, sorry about the negativity. Other then that it is a great day!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
It must be a season of platform problems - I've had to remove and reinstall MT4 on 2 'puters..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon8.gif

--- 帖子 #15 ---
There has been some really nice play (ala John McEnroe vs Bjorn Borg) between the fib levels on the 5 minute chart when the fib is placed at the top of the current retracement. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Big bounce in cable after better than expected UK PPI - UJ's continued falling - result, GJ sideways for now....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
watching closely......waiting to see if the larger fib on UJ is going to retrace or break........maybe by NY start??

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I see it, that's a &lt; 60 pip range, so far me I'd be down to the 1m chart IF I was going to try to trade it - and the higher low at 08:32 GMT would have suggested a long....but I'm using 80 pips range as my minimum for walking the 5m, so I'll pass

--- 帖子 #19 ---
The positive PPI data in the UK caused cable to retrace all of its earlier fall. That has helped GJ into its DZ for a possible sell on the exit with a tight stop. I'm not going to be greedy and so will wait for clarification as I'm also thinking that UJ is due for a retrace..... Edit: The lower dashed yellow line is not the actual low - which was exactly at 1.9400...what a surprise a 100 line again!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hello Nice thread! I spent all weekend reading through Skunny's Thread but man it's long! Can you please give me any hints where to look to learn more about your Fib set up with the trading decision zone and the T1, T2 and T3? Thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Ended up as a nice trade although FXDD froze and had me sitting like a Kangaroo in the headlights. I took 20 and retreated to the safety of the outback. T2 also happens to line up closely to the 50% retracement of the major fib you have on your chart. Hmmm, cosmic order.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
It's allllllllllll in Skunny's thread

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi casperbet, Click on Islanders name in this thread. That will take you to his profile. From there you can read all his posts in Skunny's thread to get the evolution and lots of trade example. Anyhoo, I strongly suggest you make the commitment to read Skunny's thread as well as it will be well worth it in the long run. There is no substitute for a little elbow grease, nodoz, and vhands.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
As I said on the first page, please do your homework as that way YOU will understand what we guys who have put in hundreds of hours of study have learnt....if you insist on a shortcut just zoom in on my posts, but you'll miss out on a lot!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thanks for your replys. I am not looking for a shortcut but just wanted to know how to get the fib looks like yours as this really helps me when testing vhands

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Nice pips - and as you've noticed, GJ really likes the 50% retrace, especially after a fast move

--- 帖子 #27 ---
just modify the properties of your fib tool in MT4 DZ = 61.8 and 38.2 AL = 23.7 and 76.4 TP1 = 138 TP2 = 161

--- 帖子 #28 ---
So now we have the most difficult decision with any trend following methodogy - and I'm still working to find the most reliable solution. The double bottom in GJ in the 8:10 and 9:25 GMT candles is an indication that for now the fall has been halted. Also, these times came right after the LO, so the Brits are buying - but for how long? The 5m GJ IFib has a wide 194 pip range and price has now moved above the upper DZ line and hit the upper Alert Line - so a large retrace of the initial fall. IF I am going to consider a long entry, I need some confirmation and that will either be by price coming back into the DZ and then exiting to the upside for a Buy at the upper AL, OR by price consolidating above the DZ (which just happens to start at the 208.00 level) and then continuing upwards. In this case, I'd buy above the 208.50 level as price would then probably continue to at least the 100 level. Either way, I'll be careful as I dont want to give back any of those nice pips that I got from the early fall - I've already hit my daily target.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

Hi everybody, Thank you Islander, for starting this thread. I think this will go a long way in helping us to progress along the educational path that Skunny has set for us. I really appreciate this. Allow me to share with you my 15M chart on the GBP/JPY from around 11:25 am.(GMT) This is what I'm looking at with my trading buddy. We have four cycles from four different time frames: Daily(blue); 4H(purple); 1H(yellow); 15M(red) We originally planned to manage trades on the 1H timeframe. But since you guys seem to be doing it down on the 15M, I thought I would try the same and see. You could probably see the confluences that we get at some price levels. One of the major confluences that we're watching is the confluence of resistance at around 208.31-34, which is capping the current price action from continuing on the upside at the moment. This same price level happens to be the pivot point (50%) retrace of on the 1H cycle (yellow). I would love to hear everyone's thoughts about what could be a plausible game plan if resistance were to hold here and price starts to move back down again, (which certainly seems possible at the moment). I'm especially interested in your opinion, Islander, since we seem to be watching a similar picture. At which point do we say we're good for a short trade? Would it be logical to enter if and when it breaks the swing short of the 15M cycle (207.51), or should we wait for it to reach/break the Break Short level at 206.78? I personally think that since the previous low was established by a dramatic drop, it would be difficult to reach it a second time, much less break much farther below that significant low. Thank you everyone, and I hope this thread will benefit everybody involved, in a big way. I pledge 161.8% contribution! Tony

Sorry to interrupt, ive read bo's skunnies threeads. can you tell me what fib levels and how names are you using? necause i was browsing ure posts islander and there are more then enough of them and i had diffriculties findging lol thank you ps. this thread will be rocking in some time

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Tony - from what I am watching - my last 5m fib - IF price does decide to continue down I'll enter on a clear break down out of the DZ - also 207.51 level - and below the AL level. Price often bounces between the two ALs whilst deciding which way to break - the problem here is that they are 102 pips apart, so ideally I'd like to draw a narrower fib - I'm considering this now.... Guess I need some of Karmos Patience Pills!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thank you for your reply, Mr. Islander Seems price (GBP/JPY) is caught in a sideway channel now. It's been bouncing back and forth between the two confluence areas (207.87 - 208.31). See how price reacts to various levels from different timeframes, especially where there are confluences. Could this kind of range bound price action not be used to range trade or buy/sell on a break out of either side of the tight range? I thought about this but wasn't confident enough to do it. Otherwise there's a 30-40 pip room to scalp in that channel. I prefer to trade on breakouts though. Also, since that confluence of resistance has held firm, I've walked the fib down from the previous high at 208.66 (before the big drop), to the new resistance at 208.39. Do you guys think this is ok? So the decision zone has become a bit tighter. Where did you end up drawing your new fib, Islander? Tony

--- 帖子 #33 ---
That's where I'd put it too - narrower swing tighter DZ and stops... I have to go out for a few hours, back later...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Latest 5 minute trade, entry on the close outside of the DZ. A nice little 40 pipper to T1. To fib or not to fib -- that's no question, definitely to fib.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Here's how my trade progression worked on the last trade taking into consideration GBPUSD and USDJPY: The 15:50 candle was the one that closed beneath the AL line. If you look at the GBPUSD at the 15:50 (highlighted) candle you see there was already an entry there on a break of the Entry line and it was heading to T1. Then the USDJPY made a strong move down at 16:20 (highlighted) follow up by a break out of the DZ at 16:40. At 16:40 my T1 was hit on GBPJPY. Someone's blowing a dog whistle -- got to go.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Nice trade MB - a narrow range and you still got good pips - and you picked up on UJ leading GJ down, and cable also dropped a little too. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #37 ---
nice job MB............I think now that Issy's got his own thread I'm going to have to stay up through the whole London session

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I'm still not seeing any confirmation of a trend direction on this TF......falling highs, but also the lows have held, with a higher low in early US trading - so a wedge waiting to break out. Need another Patience Pill - or in my case a San Miguel as the sun's "over the yard arm" - here as well as in the outback!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
HI ISLANDER!!!!! OOOOooo i am working up some ripsnorters for you JK but I DO LOVE THE YEN!!!! I will keep my hands in my pockets hehehe NICE THREAD! Sizz

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yeeks - that's a long awake stretch for a Pacific Coast Dude!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
LOL Sizz - hope you're keeping your pips warm! - just hang in here when you want some more......

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi all Just floatting from Skunny s thread to this one to say hello, hope to learn something here. Maxwells

--- 帖子 #43 ---
From the active 5min chart posted earlier.....coming back into the DZ, holding at the 50% line, exiting the DZ and then breaking the AL line was - for me - a Buy with a stop under the 50% line. However, with so much chop since the early moves, I think that it would be more prudent to keep my powder dry and wait for a clearer signal...so far its not showing any clear decision.....patience wins the day!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I hope that you do - learn something here - please keep floating in http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Islander, Thank you for starting this thread,could you post a template of your IFIB please. Thanks

--- 帖子 #46 ---
The I-fib is just a regular old fib with it's "numbers" modified to being labeled as letters.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
WHAT!!!! YOU MEAN THERE AREN'T ANY SUPER DUPER INDICATORS !!!! JUST FIBS!!!!!!! MOLEY COW!!!! WHAT KIND OF "SYSTEM" IS THIS!????

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Issy, I wanted to post my pre FO/LO 5M chart to make sure I have it right. Didn't quite have a 85 pip range but it looks close enough unless things change quite a bit before Frankie opens. Looks like we have some confluence at the previous swing 38, the daily pivot, and the sell line. As well as possible M3 resistance to the top side.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
in-n-out..........12 pips is 12 pips ** edited for what would have been a better fib placement for TP1 hit **

--- 帖子 #50 ---
GM Pip - your chart's fine, BUT remember that the chart that I posted earlier was still active, with a T1 at 209.01 - finally hit, 11 hours after it broke up from the DZ. The more conservative entry on the break of the upper AL at 208.13 was worth over 80 pips - so patience was finally rewarded!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nice Trade Piphitman, I was looking at this setup but was somewhat hesitant about taking the trade. The fib swing was a little too close for my comfort but I guess sometimes you gotta have guts to have glory. I also had this setup shown in the picture... not sure if its a a correct area to place fibs but the DZ tested earlier today would have been a great trade, lets see if it tests this new 50% level.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Ahhhhh, I see, this one?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
the reason I took the GBP/JPY trade was because I was already in the Cable trade for about an 8 pip profit when the Geppy started moving upward. I get an itchy trigger finger on the Geppy so I bailed after 12 pips.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Not a lot of action in the Asian Session. UJ is still sideways in a narrow range. Cable rallied a little and is trying to break up out of its 15m DZ and that has pulled GJ out of its 15m DZ and up to its 15m AL line. This allowed the 5m GJ chart to finally get up to its T1. Now to see what Frankie brings.....

--- 帖子 #55 ---
here's 2 possibilities - I've just used the yellow one for a buy on the exit of the DZ - if I had been up earlier, I'd be in off the salmon fib...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
For those in a trade off either of the last two narrow range fibs, do please remember that the Frankfurt Hour often has reversals and the true move of the European Session frequently starts after the London Open.....so dont let a profit turn into a loss......there will be another opportunity soon.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Edit: 07:55GMT Yellow T1 hit for over 40 pips, salmon T2 for over 50 pips - a nice start to the European Session - now what will the Brits do?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
important news item today also ....GBP CPI in two hrs.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks But I think loss is my middle name.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
LOL - I've been there too, but with the IFib concept they are now infrequent - its just a matter of spending some time on vhands and walking sufficient IFibs to gain confidence and get to walk with the flow of the market... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Early bird gets the worm, or is that early Issy gets the Pips? My alarm clock and I were in a wrestling match and well...it had me pinned for a while. Has anybody ever worn out a snooze button? Wonder if it's possible. Always some good action in the FO-LO timeframe. Don't get anxious MB, there's always more trades right around the corner...this is the geppy afterall. Piptacular trades Issy! That's one of the things I love about doing the backtesting with vhands -- when you've executed hundreds of these trades with real prices in a psuedo-real environment it becomes second nature to place trades with confidence, protect your profits, and be patient and wait for your targets to get hit. Piphitman -- I am completely with you on taking profit and getting out of a trade early that you don't have 100% confidence in! I was on my laptop the other day and had my Trading console on top of my charts so I could just see the action on the right side of my screen when all of sudden the price started moving and gave me an entry signal. Oh it was beautiful, and I was starting to do the pip dance as I was watching price go my way on the chart to the right...then it happened, I noticed price wasn't going the right way on my trading platform (MB Trading, what else of course? lol). I was watching a EURAUD chart and entered on the geppy. Cost me 20 pips ouch. MB

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Here's the latest chart.....nice profits should have been taken from the previous charts. I'm not happy with the second high just after LO - only 14 pips above the high at 07:05 - that's a sign of weakness... Edit: That was quick....already dropped out of the bottom of the DZ to hit the lower AL. Now IF it moves back into the DZ and the drops again it will be a Sell as a reversal on a break of the lower AL. There is UK data due in 45 mins....

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Ok, it's not a M5 neither a M15... but that was my trade today... announced in Skunnys thread... some 70 pips.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Cable's fall has activated the short - UJ's not helping as its holding above its daily pivot....at 106.89 and cable needs to make a convincing move under its 9500 level...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Nice one DXT - whatever works best for you - lol, M10 I guess..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi MB - so you finally gave up on the snoozing and got in front of your screen - lol, I do know the feeling, especially when its dark and cold.... Now to see if cables drop is a fakeout in front of the news....TWT

--- 帖子 #66 ---
this one blew right through the zones, baggin some mo pips before news.........

--- 帖子 #67 ---
WOW!!! GBP bin berry berry good......so now what Issy wait for the bloodletting to stop, wait for another mini swing and then take some more?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
That's great, I took a partial for safety and left some for T1 = 50+ and T2 = 70+.....now let it settle and then walk the IFib....its looking like a 150 pip range this time.... Edit: LOL - I just noticed that my 5m cable IFib hit the 262 extension to the pip - I guess that would be T4!!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
maybe time for the 1M chart???

--- 帖子 #70 ---
T4 !!!! Wow...I guess we have lift off

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I couldn't resist.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif Edit: FYI, walking the narrower range IFib places the 50% line 1 pip above the DP......mm I smell synchronicity.....some time in the run up to the NY traders coming in would be nice....

--- 帖子 #72 ---
very nice Issy, great pips tonight, I'm going to bed before I blow em. see ya tomorrow. ph

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Well done - dont let any of those slippery pips escape from your bank - sleep well and there will be plenty more pips to catch tomorrow http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Now we wait.....

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I hope you guys are watching.....cable's hit its 50% retrace and GJ got to about 48%....but made it to its 50 level - it does like the 50s and 100s Edit: now the third trade since the start of the European Session has been activated and I already have my stop to break even + a few.....IF it can break to new lows and hit T1 it will be worth over 100 pips...both UJ and GJ will have to break under their DPs for new lows to be made.... Edit: stop hit for +8 as cable has now rallied and is headed for its 500 level again - more indecision / chop. I'm out for a couple of hours.....

--- 帖子 #76 ---
islander can you post your current geppy trade. thank you

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Islander Is the shaded box in the DZ area plotted by the indicator on your chart or do you place it manually? It comes very handy

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Islander, Great thread you have going here...looking forward to following it. Nothing constructive to add at this juncture, just thought I would say hello. I have followed skunny's thread and your posts on there when I had the time, some really good stuff there. You have an enviable grasp of the way the market moves...nice to see you collecting those pips. Regards.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Wolf - thanks for your post - I appreciate the comments from an experienced trader like yourself - and of course I agree with you about the quality of the work in Skunny's thread. Regards Islander

--- 帖子 #80 ---
As I said before I went out, I was stopped out of my short for +8 pips. Both cable and UJ staged small rallies and so GJ moved out of the DZ to the upside and consolidated between the AL / 209 level and the top of the DZ, indicating that the longs were going to be in play on any break above the 209 level. This happened, with the rally so far reaching T1, 94 pips above the AL, so plenty of opportunity to collect 80 or more pips, with the the possibilty of more to come...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
For those - like me - who were not around to catch the earlier Buy, here's a narrower range set of IFibs, taking in the latest high and giving an entry on the bounce off the dashed red line the Daily R 1 line...here, the salmon T1 will cover the yellow fibs T2... Edit: - ah, my salmon T1 line is actually blue, as its also my Chin Alert alarm line - I'm trying to economise with lines!!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Howard - its the standard rectangle from the shapes menu - I just walk it with the fibs - nothing too fancy here!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yellow T2 hit for &gt; 110 pips - that should not be a surprise if you were also watching cable, which also hit its T2 which was 1 pip under its 9600 level. I have UJ pulled back to its 50% level and it needs to bounce if the salmon/blue T1 at 210.30 is to be hit, as cable can be expected to have some pull back after its 108 pip rally. Remember to protect any unrealised, profitable pips as this swing in GJ is now 240 pips..... Edit: UJ did bounce off its 50% retrace and cable has had a pop above its 600 level - result salmon T2 hit for another 100 pip move....

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Dear Master, Is my homework correct

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Well that would depend on the time when you actually drew that fib. If it was within a few candles of the 207.80 Low - after the fall - its fine.......BUT IF you put it on much later, after the doji high candle to 209.48, above your 209.30 high, then why not use that candle (as I did a little later for my salmon fibs) as it will get you thinking of a buy in the pull back after the rally... In this case, there was not a lot of difference, but I believe in walking the fibs as soon as new highs / lows are made as I'm always looking for the next entry.... Either way, I hope you made some good pips..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif Edit: LOL - I'm Islander or Issy - just a fellow student, sharing ideas...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Don't worry, i'm noob in all this drawing tools, but not noob on trading, take the up from 208.70, for another day @ + 100 pips. Hope you you too make good pips

--- 帖子 #87 ---
This rally since the low just after LO GJ is now 275 pips - that's 85 more than the average range for this session, so I wonder when it will start pulling back. I've walked the latest Gold IFib to the last swing of 104 pips, just in case 210.54 holds as the high - if it goes higher, I'll just reset the top line...it has its R2 level at 210.68 above and then the 211 level....T3 for the Yellow and then for the Salmon IFibs - IF hit, that would be some move....

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Great, I've been long, then short twice, then long again.......dammed sideways markets really make us work to get and keep pips in our banks....

--- 帖子 #89 ---
R3 @ 211.02 Do we have enough strength ? That is the question

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Issy, I know right? are you basically just grabbing all the pips? Can you share? sheesh. Little do you know, I have full Ifibs set up rocking over here on 4 accounts with 8 screens! what have you racked up like 14000 pips in the last two weeks? Your bank account must read like the atr of the fx market I have been holding my own in fibs lately right now I am long until 211.50 on gepster and basically have been tracking the movement and positioning off of 5 min fibs and am just really short on yen. Actually though, I would really like to know your Stats with IFIBS and you too Piphitman. you guys are KILLING it seems. I hear 19 for 20 with a MPP of 1500? for a week? not tooo shabby, in fact brilliant. uh I changed my mind I want royalties..4000 EUR a week should cover me or at least my bar tab. LOL Sizz.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Sizz - yep, its going well, this walking the fibs stuff.....even in the chop of the last few days it will help you into safe trades.....remember, I only quote "potential pips" - i.e. the gross length of the swing as its just a guide and easy to measure, so you must allow for slippage, spread etc - but the end result so far is plenty of consistant trades and pips in the bank..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Couldn't resist, could you? Did you hurt yourself, bet you are still chuckling, today.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Well it has been one of those steady, creeping afternoons for us Europeans - salmon T3 just hit at 210.95 - I'm done trading for today - No 2 Daughter's just arrived back from Brussels, so I need to play catch up over a beer...BIB

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Holy Toledo........I go to sleep for a few hrs and I wake up to find my "little blue" 5M DZ area from 7 hrs ago has blown up big time...........just look at all those I-fibs that were there to be had........had a feeling NY would be profitable. Like Skunny said once "the market goes up, then down, then up, then down, then up....." Great job Issy.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Cool - go to bed and wake up with more pips in your bank.....WTG.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Maybe we should add TP4 to the IFIB Islander? Also we can point out all levels that are needed that will be very usefull for new people and not.

One Questions,who are you setting the Fibs from the DZ Area? From the previus day high low?The DZ area is 38.2%, 50 %, 61,8%,its ok? Thanks,and best regards

--- 帖子 #98 ---
The Decision Zone is from the 38.2% line to the 61.8% line, yes. The high/low of the fibs is set at areas of support &amp; resistance (swing highs, swing lows, double tops/bottoms, etc.). Price should play of off the inner levels of the fibs (38.2, 50, 61.8) nicely...if it doesn't, try readjusting your fib to another S/R point. Does that answer your questions November?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Please do your homework on Skunny's thread and you will find the answers there...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
here's my last post for today.....the alternative is to use the 207.81 low - but I'd rather use that on the 15m....I'll look again before FO.... PS from my posts I see we had 4 tradeable IFib moves today for potentials of 50, 70, 8 and 190 pips..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #101 ---
were yours looking anything like this Issy? **edit, excuse me my first fib was backwards**

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hey there Islander.......been following Skunny's and your thread but curious as to when you are walking the fibs? Maybe I have missed something sorry if it is a bad question.......just not sure if I am in the general area code or in outter space. Thanks

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thanks .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!From you Ignorance

I like what I see and learn here so far. Keep ' em coming. Maxwells

TP 1 was hit. Here's another chart.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
15 &amp; 5, On our way to Frankie and London **edited charts** 15M DZ is sitting right on the pivot. 5M range is 86 pips, looks like 5M is finding some resistance on the daily pivot as well, but it looks as if 5M is heading up into the DZ. as of this time (2hrs till London)........looks like UJ and Cable are heading upwards as well.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
or would you use this small of a range on the 5M Issy???? seems to fit within the fib hits ok?????

--- 帖子 #108 ---
14 pips on tp1.........Cable is getting ready to be close for entry as well

--- 帖子 #109 ---
GM all - just to keep the wider picture in mind....

--- 帖子 #110 ---
And here's my current IFib on GJ - with an earlier one too - there were other possibilities that could have got an even earlier sell off a narrower range...I hope that you guys got some pips....

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Issy my 5M cable bouncing in between the DZ and AL......it looks like we'll have a new 5M (GBP/JPY) fib for London open???

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thx Pip - I see it now... Your 4 charts earlier about yesterday - you needed 1 less on the right and an earlier 1 on the left for the sell around FO.... Edit: and opportunities from your other charts too.....but I try to keep to ~80 min range where possible....

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi folks, I've been observing trade set-ups and results by Islander and PipHitman, and they are absolutely stunning!! I would like to ask one question: do you always get into a trade once price breaks the Hi or Lo (0, 100%)of your fib range? Does it matter which way it's going? How do you determine the probability of price proceeding to the destination rather than reverse back to the other side of the decision zone after breaking those levels? I try to use confluences from multiple higher timeframes to get the general direction of larger cycles. But sometimes the higher timeframes would still be in the neutral zone, and thus don't really help in predicting trend or direction. I would like to hear your thoughts on this. Thank you! Tony

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks GM - hope that you got some pips too....

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Issy is the Sensei I'm just a student, but the key IMO is to enter before the 0/100 for a better pippage profit. that's why it's so important to watch very very closely what happens in between and just outside the DZ lines...trend lines, higher highs, lower lows, higher lows, etc, example right now on 5M cable price hasn't penetrated yet but, is bouncing around in between the DZ and AL I might go short on this soon, still waiting and watching though. Edit: another thing on Cable right now on the 5M chart, the 0 line is also on the the %50 retracement fib line of the previous swing. could be tough to get through

--- 帖子 #116 ---
GM Tony - thanks for the compliment....and yes, I am watching the 15m, hence my first post as on that TF we are possibly setting up for a buy - whilst the 5m entries are short. For me, THE most important thing is the price action in the DZ - OK, so its just the 38 % to 62% retracement zone. Here, as you'll have seen in your backtesting, is where most pull backs finish and the short term - this TF - trend resumes. Thus the lowest risk and highest reward is to take a trade on the exit from the DZ (or earlier when you've built up some real time experience) - so my entries are already well into profit as price breaks the AL line and then the H / L that the IFib was swung from. From the 5m chart above, the Sell was at 210.05 and price ran under the prior low (at the DP line) and on down to hit T1 for a 70 pip move! Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #117 ---
OK we're now into Frankies hour and have had some fast moves here during the past days....I've put on this 75 pip ranged fib - OK Pip its a tight one! - to watch in case we get a reversal to the upside. The heads-up here is from cable, that MAY have just put in a higher low....TWT

--- 帖子 #118 ---
From what I've been seeing, we have double bottoms on the 3 pair, so I'm watching for the break out long.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thanks GM - I see that UJs last low was only 6 pips under its low 4 hours earlier - and now its led the bounce....IF GJ can pull back into the latest DZ (gold) and then exit upwards I'll be buying.... Edit: if the rally continues without that pull back I'll buy the break above the 210 level....watch UJ. its at its DP of 107.22...

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Yeah, I haven't gotten comfortable with the 15 min tf, yet, so I'm watching it from the H1.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
ya, higher lows on last two cable candles, both inside the dz, GJ holding steady above the AL too, 9 mins till London.........

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Oh how I hate chop and reversals......time for a patience pill.....

--- 帖子 #123 ---
price all over the place, 15M still looking hopeful for a long, pop a couple o' Karmo's pills

--- 帖子 #125 ---
hi all, im a big fan of fibo. i use fibo retracement and expantion/profit target as my trading tools. i found that it is more accurate to target. i might only read this thread as skunny's and bobo is to much to read... (im a slow reader)... btw..on 15m...once the price break yesterday high, im targeting it will reach 212.18..but of course it will play around 38 ngn 62 for a while...this is the reason i join this tread...to improve price projection and target and offcourse more pips... here is my chart...it didnt look like islander's chart yet...as im still struggling with AL n DZ and other term from skunnys and bobo. i know that this thread is naked...so, forgive me for putting an indi overthere regards, nasier

--- 帖子 #126 ---
ismamn, are there any candles on your chart?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
why not just make a new chart and ONLY put on your fibs, then we could see them, at present they are lost in the clutter.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif

--- 帖子 #128 ---
You guys are so funny tonight!!!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
haha...this is my 1st time uploading chart in FF... here it is...

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Thank you both, Islander and Piphitman for your very prompt and generous answers. They really helped me to see the picture more clearly now when I look at price action. I supposed the same type of PA observation is used to gauge likelihood of a break/retracement at the target levels as well? Do you guys scale out of your trades by closing parts of your position at different target levels? Or do you just watch the speed of price when it gets closer to T1 and close the entire position if it shows any sign of slowing down? I tend to shoot for T1 and take profit, except for when price just shoots right through it, and I'm just not fast enough to close it before it reaches T2 Tony

--- 帖子 #131 ---
already +160 tonight as posted in Skunny's thread, but I'm on a roll so here goes P.S. I didn't buy it on the first penetration (Doji). I like to see the nervous nellies get out of the way first, which means I draw the fib, wait for a retrace, slop, enter on BO

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Great to see you over here PiprPro. So you don't enter on first penetration out of DZ, but wait for a retrace then enter on the BO. Do you mean the BO of the DZ though, or the 0/100 level? In other words, after that retrace got out of the way(the doji), did you enter long as soon as it penetrated 209.82 the second time?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
yes - you are close - the 3rd BO. 1=doji, 2=next candle, 3 =candle that broke up to the gann line for a hedged reversal (that one on demo). I'm still playing with gann, but so far the hedge is working. P.S. dumped the hedge +1 pip

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi PPP - thanks for popping in - I did get triggered long earlier and then out on a tight stop for positive pips - but this morning the chop is wicked. Cable is bouncing between its 9600 level and its DP at 9556 and whilst UJ has finally held above its DP at 107.22 it has yet to put in a convincing rally. As you correctly said, waiting for the pull back was the better entry.....and should finally make it to the Gold T1 at 210.37

--- 帖子 #135 ---
got in between AL an 0 line 209.97, got out at 210.20 just wasn't going anywhere. edit: figures, i get out price goes berserk lol

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well, I got in at 209.75 and out at 210.10 for 35.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
now I'm out of the long position with another +68 to the T2=210.59, this could easily go to the main fib, but I need some sleep

--- 帖子 #138 ---
nice job GM................ at least I had a 1/2 lot over in cable that rode it up Let's see what BOE has to say in a few mins........

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks, now I can see it and allowing for different brokers, it is the same as the one that I posted earlier - so I guess that means that you're on the correct track.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Edit: and for those trading the 15m TF and buying on the exit of the DZ, you were long from 209.82 - nice one!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
sweet PPP...........

--- 帖子 #141 ---
u lookin at this now Issy???? Edit: LOL never mind, another rocket ride

--- 帖子 #142 ---
that was the gann-4 that stalled price at 210.20 during that candle, once it broke price jumped, literally

--- 帖子 #143 ---
like a rocket on cable too, I was TP's out on my cable trade 1.9612 in an instant.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hey Pip - pips in the bank is ALWAYS good - there'll be another trade soon. PPP - thanks for the Gann info - I'm behind the curve this morning. Your contributions are very much appreciated http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Nice one guys... I'm late as I'm trading on H1... long from the AL of the daily and the swing approximately. Wherever it goes..

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yup, cable finally broke 600 and then its M3 at 613 - after chop comes the move.....the gold T3s already hit and it will be 211.00 next.... Edit: also, note how off the Yellow IFib, price hit the lower T1 and has now reversed and hit the upper T1 - Skunny talked about this.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
you are correct Issy, after last nights highway piprobbery the pips were a little tougher to come by tonight but still all in all not bad. Edit: 160 pips upward in London session so far and counting

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Closed half with +50... the rest is free

--- 帖子 #149 ---
It looks as if cables going to hit its T1, which is close to its R1 line at 9670 and that should push GJ up another 50 - as long as UJ can hold above its M3 at 107.43 - lets hope it has a pull back first so we can jump on board...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Nice one DXT - that's the Way To Go - multiple exits and lock in some profit on the remainder http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I didn't do the short trades to night, but I bought the dips on the 3 sister pairs for 298 pips, with 2 positions still open, with a BE s/l. I've got my groove back! Sorry, not bragging, but I'm just so happy!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Fantastic haul, GM! Your pip skip well 'n truly filled tonight - nice trading

--- 帖子 #153 ---
The Yellow T3 from my earlier 5m chart has now been hit at 211.42. Also the Gold T4 has been passed - I'm waiting to walk the fibs, but not until there is a pull back. There is a Yellow T4 just under the 212 level and also the 15m Buy is active, with its T1 at 212.24, so lets see how far it goes.....but if you're in profit, dont give more that a few pips back. Sooner or later, there will be a retrace.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Great texas... good job I closed my second half with +80 close to the R1-T1 cluster at the close of the last candle! Done for today...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Here's my update - I've used the narrowest range that I could see AND the 50% line is exactly on the M3 pivot line - for me that confirms this placement...

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Maybe today's low is not a bad place for our low?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Woohooo - WTG GM, nice pips safe in your bank... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Nothing wrong with your placement - I tightened my range so as to be more certain of getting an entry - as has already happened....BUT there could still be a deeper pull back as there is a possible lower high in progress - we'll see.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi guys! Nice work you are doing here. Have been following this thread and the Skunny all along and have started trading this in demo and been doing some vHands. Just a question, what is M3 pivot line?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks NAL The Daily Pivot level is the prior days High+Low+Close/3 ....from this a number of other levels are calculated - usually R1 &amp; R2, SI and S2 - the M levels are the mid points. This system was first used by the floor traders in the old Pits where open outcry trading took place - like way before anything electronic - when the sliderule was high tech! Dove Alliance did some excellent work and explainations in the UJ thread some 6 or 9 months ago - you'll get good info there. These levels are useful, especially in the Yen pairs.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
The spike has been caused by good US Retail Sales data - and went to 211.89 - over 100 pips from the entry on the exit from the DZ on the last chart that I posted at 11:16 GMT....I took some partial profits in case there is a pull back. T1 is at 212.02 and T2 at 213.39, which will be 303 pips from the low just before FO.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Way to GM I am happy for you. It sure feels good when everything rocks!! Nikki

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thank you for explanation!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
This is where I have drawn my Fib, is it correct? If so, will next target will be T1 - 212.27, which is also R2 and just below daily T2?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
The big picture is always the best : AL to Target 1 for a nice move

--- 帖子 #166 ---
The fib on the left of your sceen is the one that I have and am still using as the active fib - OK, so it already hit T2, BUT I'm waiting to be convinced that its put in a high and is pulling back. Your right side fib is assuming that the high is in at 212.25 and its already moved higher....IF the current high of 212.48 holds and price pulls back close to the 212 level, then I'll draw a new fib from the low at 210.87....

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Can you post the indicator which show buyers and sellers, it's damn interesting, please ? Concerning your fibos, i'm on the learning state, but as you could see on my picture i keep it simple, just the high and low of yesterday. Thanks

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Nice one - the "best" one is IMO just personal choice - the longer the TF, the wider the fibs and larger the risk - but higher TFs are better when you have less time to be close to your 'puter...both give us plenty of pips if traded correctly.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #169 ---
That's right, we need the both worlds

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hope you all got the easy breakout from 211.45 to both 15m and 5m fibs targets at 212.15...well, I did. Maxwells Happy pipping to all.

Can I ask you guys where your current fibs are (0, 100) for GU, GJ, UJ on the 5 and 15 min TF?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I had a couple of 'puter problems earlier - an automatic update happened and rebooted my 'puter whilst I went to get a coffee - and I may have missed posting the Yellow IFibs that I talked about. Now I've walked that IFib to the Gold ones - I mentioned a couple of posts ago that I was waiting to place these...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Here's the 15m .....still active....

--- 帖子 #177 ---
GU 5m is from 9548 to 9654 and UJ 5m 107.44 to 108.36 GU 15m 9548 to 9654 - active Buy from 9560 UJ 15m 106.34 to 107.52 - Buy was at 107.09, T2 hit at 108.24

Cheers! I find it more troubling drawing the 15M fibs, but the 5M was spot on. Just one thing: I have the UJ low from the 5bar low 107.49 instead. What do you think about that?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Are you saying you have 107.49 as the last UJ 5m low vs 107.44 that I posted? - if so no problem as we may have different feeds

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hey Karmo - welcome - are you bringing some of your Patience Pills?.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #183 ---
[quote=Islander;1849414] I hope any long traders from this Gold IFib have seen the lower high in GJ on the 5m chart.....for me, if this current bounce off the 212 level fails to break up I'll bank my pips - GJ has had a 315 pip rally since just before the FO - more than 100 pips above the average range for the European session....

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I'm finished for today....continued successful set ups, off the 5m a short for ~70, then a long for ~150 and the last long for ~30 for me - or still open if you're watching it. The 15m was worth ~230 to T1....that was the better trade today.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Looks like those longs you projected in London time were hit N.Y. style Issy.....good job. One of these days I'm going to stay awake for the entire London and US session. (without being on a rescue mission of course)

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Maxwells, I was wondering if you were able to enter in the area I have circled in red, or maybe in the smaller red dash marks on the way up? That is truly the essence of the I-fibs IMO. Being able to get an early entry gives you pips in the bank as price works up to the 0/100 line and if it goes the other way on you the drawdown is less. Nice trade btw.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Thanks for this, interesting.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Issy, It looks as if the 15M fib has just about completed to T2, are you looking to move up your 15M fib to 209.35 ~ 212.79? 5M AL line on M3 pivot.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Long from 212.63...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Since were still a ways from Frankie I'm gonna see if there is a hit/penetration and then a retrace to get in.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
This would have been a nice trade from the bounce of the yellow fib DZ too bad I missed it. As piphitman i'm gonna wait for a retrace to the orange DZ before I enter long. If it never happens there will always be another trade right?

Hey now! Don't let me start making fun of Germans!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I have that yellow fib of yours a little lower on my chart from yesterdays low @ 209.35, but your placement of it at the 210.86 area has price hitting nicely off of the 50 then up from the DZ.

GM all.....hope you got some pips overnight - I'm catching up, here's my 5m - I'm long out of the DZ - I was too slow to slow it off the 50% line.....now lets hope that it will break up to new highs and I hope that cable will wake up and help....

--- 帖子 #203 ---
that 212.34 bounce was sweet, too bad for a 6 pip spread though. maybe PPP can tell me where the Gann line trendline is tonight so I don't bug out to early.......

--- 帖子 #204 ---
yep, need some cable help

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Here's the leader so far for this current move ....I have cable in its DZ and at its 50% line.... Edit: cables now moved up out of its DZ and is just above its M3 line at 9641

I started reading your thread but had to go to skunny and then to vhand simulator. But i think you can help me to save some time, I discover that ur trading is based on fibonacci and price action. I think if u can explain to me your I-fib, i should be able to grasp fast with my fibo knowledge and your numerous screenshot. I will be glad if you can tell me wot u consider before entry a particular trade. thanks

--- 帖子 #210 ---
5m T1 at 213.13 hit, so I've taken some profit - 68 pips - leaving more to run. If we get a pull back I'll just buy again.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

that was a very sweet good morning from Frankfurt. in 212.40 out 213.02 = 62 in 212.51 out 213.14 = 63 in 212.60 out 213.14 = 54 next stop, London Issy, did I tell you how much I appreciate your I-fibs

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Nice Trade all

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Thanks PPP I'll be looking for it this time.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I've walked this fib faster than usual in case there is a quick retrace that will allow me to re-enter with the partials that I have just exited at T1....IF price carries on up without a retrace, I'll just extent this Gold IFib...

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Great trading Pip - and I too appreciate your comments - we are all helping each other here and having regular posters who are travelling the same path benefits me too..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #217 ---
your new 5M walk is right at 86 pip range........might be heading towards the 15M T1?........... 213.53???

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yes, the IFib was named by Sizzler in a post on Skunny's thread, which is essential reading if YOU are to gain the most benefit from what we are doing here. The fib levels have been renamed and simplified to help give a clearer, simplified pictue - do a little searching and you'll soon find the posts that tell you what you need to know. Its best for you to do the work as that way you'll have a much deeper understanding - if you get stuck, then ask again and one of us will help. I think my posts in this thread really explain how I - and others - are trading and they will make more sense to you as you read the thread. Good luck on your journey Islander

--- 帖子 #219 ---
as always Issy, great charts, and great analysis, thanks for creating the thread and helping all of us. ph

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Good Morning Thanks you for this thread, can you post the templates and indicators plz Thanks again

--- 帖子 #221 ---
indicators...............

--- 帖子 #222 ---
read Skunny's thread, then Bobokus' thread. then Islanders thread.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
don't forget the daily 38.2 is 213.78, if PA gets close enough this becomes a target also

--- 帖子 #224 ---
we are just using the fibonacci tool on mt4.... without any indicators islander has renamed the 38.2 and the 61.8 fibonacci levels he also has the 0 level the 100 level, 138 extention and the 161 extention the -138 and the -161... it is very similar to bobokus thread method.... its best to start there,on fibonacci trading thread by Bobokus, then read skunny indicator free trading thread.... then when u read islanders thread it will all make sense.... hope this helps

As there was NO pull back, the Gold fibs are not valid and I'm continuing with my Yellow IFib move - T2 passed and looking for T3 at 213.68 - the R1 level...that's 124 pips from the exit of the DZ.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Bali I guarantee you will not be dissapointed, the reading will be worth its weight in pips.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Uh Oh.......is it another T4 night Issy?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
T 1 from the 15m chart posted earlier at 213.58 has just been hit for 148 pips from the exit of its DZ in the 02:15 GMT bar this morning.....

--- 帖子 #232 ---
OK...OK... I went in too early and 20 pips too high with my H1 chart. You where smarter... agreed. But got my 90 pips anyway

--- 帖子 #233 ---
2007.12.27 00:00 @ 228.45 2008.01.22 08:00 @ 204.71

--- 帖子 #234 ---
incredible, is that the Gann trend line bounce PPP mentioned this hour

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I gotta hand it to you though DX..........you were not afraid, you did go first, while me and handymn sat around on our hands. It was a nice trade that was had by all......GJ

--- 帖子 #236 ---
LOL DXT - there's no competition here for the most pips - 90 sounds great to me! - the methodogy's working off 5, 15 and 60m TFs - plenty of choices to suite all tasts....lets all just keep getting consistantly profitable entries http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Issy, Am I seeing this correctly.....UJ has not moved too much this morning (still below the 0 line)?? That last big move looks like it was fueled primarily by Cable.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Absolutely... not competing at all. Just the continuation of an earlier "pussy" post..

--- 帖子 #239 ---
OK, I'll try again with the Gold fib updated - no UK data today, so nothing till the US Trade Balance at 13:30 GMT and then Helicopter Ben's due to speak at 15:00 GMT - lol, I cant wait...

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Absolutely... so if UJ will break the resistance up... here we go for another shoot on GJ.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Spot on Pip - UJ's been in a 13 pip range since FO - cable took over with a wide range breakout 5m candle at 07:00 GMT and put on over 90 pips - 75 from the exit of its DZ....

--- 帖子 #242 ---
me too me too i see it too lol

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yep - sometimes both cable and UJ move together - that's when GJ rockets 100s of pips - other times you get one leading, then having a rest and then the other takes over, resulting in a steadier move. Either way, that's the great thing about GJ - its always moving....and we tag along for the ride.. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I too hope you too got pips too...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
was just reading the MARKET WATCH tabs on my MT4.........some Scottish bloke from RBS is talking about Cable getting up to 2.00 by weeks end??? interesting. funny because last night I was reading the same MT4 "news" and another analyst was saying to short Cable LOL!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I guess that the RBS guy is a "long"-er term player and the shorts guy scalped for 50 pips - if they traded the other way then LOL - they're in the you know what....

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi isl, wjy is active buy from 9560 if u draw the m15 fib like you mentioned from those high lows? please explain a little thank you.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
looks like UJ finally ready to help out a little

--- 帖子 #249 ---
penetration.... but no follow through yet .... tough resistacne area here and on gj as well..... we'll see... but be careful.....

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Finally got a retrace and another entry - the hit on the 213 level was obvious...cable also obliged with a tiny penetration - lol Dagoods, better than nothing - but we need to watch it as it made a small double top on its 5m...

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Sorry, I put down an incorrect number - too much haste! Chart attached - the actual exit from the DZ was at 9619......still worth 90+ pips Edit: well picked up - you must be getting the idea of how IFibs work

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Is it not time to walk the fibs on this 15m?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hahaha... me too, nearly at the same price!

--- 帖子 #254 ---
dont know if u guys are short or long right now.... lol u know me always have to be diffrent.... but seriously i have both short and long activations depending on timeframe so just be careful you guys..... wouldnt want u staying up for hours on a rescue mission lol

--- 帖子 #255 ---
You're absolutly right - I was enjoying a leisurely bath with alarms set http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Care to show us you thoughts?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Well where is there a Sell Signal from the IFibs.....OK, so GJ has almost hit the Jan 30th high of 213.69 - and has the Jan 25th high above at 214.04 - but the last I posted was a long entry off the 213 level.....still active with a locked in profit. For me the bull move has yet to tell me that its finished......

--- 帖子 #257 ---
The price is stalling before the news and Bernanke (this guy has the genius to kill my trades) So I'm considering getting out with half my position with +10 and see for the rest

--- 帖子 #258 ---
15 min chart GU

--- 帖子 #259 ---
GBPJPY 5 min

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Now it's me, the pussy. Out with +10 and -5 Getting too hot for my taste. Wish you luck guys...

--- 帖子 #261 ---
hi islander... i think u answered your own question.... my studies on vhands show me that u cant fib through tough resistance....well sometimes u can.... but... its not the best place to take a trade IMO.... sell fib is dagoods skunny style and not an Ifib.... but i think you have sell fibs at this point...even the way u do them..... no? going down to 212.93 at least i'd say PS resistance in the form of MONTHLY pivot 200 ema previous s/r like u pointed out.... very tough to push stragiht through

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thanks Howard - that'll work...on the 5m I now see a lower high - it will probably chop into the US data and the BBs talk time....BIB

--- 帖子 #263 ---
If I swing a narrow ranged fib from the high to 213 - then yes, that would indicate a sell - but I prefer to wait - got plenty of pips in the bank from earlier and I'm now flat - time for lunch...bib

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi all History repeated hitself...Same as yesterday, i'll buy (depending on price action due to bernanke and news) at breakout to both targets from the 15m and 5 m. What do you guys think? Maxwells Happy piping for all to piphitman: i m not buying my first leg at retracement, im doing it at breakout THEN I'll add at retracement.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi Maxwells - I think you know by now that I dont enter on breakouts - I've been burnt too many times doing that, so now I only enter on action around the DZ. That way if its a false breakout, I'm already in profit and can close out without any loss - and usually with a small profit.... Good luck with whatever YOU decide to do.... Edit: just look at the action on cable to see what I mean......there the breakout to new highs stalled after 9 pips and has now pulled back 26 pips......the buy out of the DZ 55 mins earlier at 9683 gave you a potential 44 pips gross profit....go figure...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Thanks Iskander for great thread! My little toy (maybe its exists already): This indicator draw DZ box by fibo values. For setup: Set indicator variable “Fib_name” to Fibo name which you want to draw DZ box, e.g “Fibo 9952”. In my picture Fibo name is "iFib_1" and indicator variable "Fib_name" is set same: "iFib_1". If you move your fibo, then DZ box moves automatically.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
The entry out of the DZ mentioned in # 202 finally got to T3 at 213.68 and has had a spike to a new high of 213.90 - up 145 pips. See how the break to the new high was 39 pips into a doji high candle - the pull back to date is 54 pips and counting.....mm anyone for a fakeout? - TWT

--- 帖子 #268 ---
here's the update...... EEdit: remember Ben B and his gang are testifying in 15m - IMO its time to be cautious...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Thanks - there are several similar ones in both Skunny's and Bo's threads....

--- 帖子 #270 ---
You got a very good point here...I will study it in the near futur. Tkx Maxwells

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Short on the break of the lower AL at 213.18.... Edit: out at 212.62 - sweet

--- 帖子 #272 ---
That was a great 50+ pips....here's the updated chart....some graveyard doji at the low...

--- 帖子 #273 ---
You're welcome - best to study, test on vhands and then use it IF YOU like it

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I dont think I'll trade again today - some 210 potential pips from the moves already finished and it is Valentines DAy, so an early Sundowner is in order.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I want to make sure I understand how you traded this, Islander... Chart attached with my interpretation... Entry understood... Now, the exit... I am assuming this is because price was nearing T1?... [Note: I have been following this thread closely and am currently working through the Skunny and Bobokus threads... Started playing with vHands today as well... all I can say is WOW... What an excellent tool... ] Magnus p.s. This thread seems to be evolving into a great source of learning... Keep it up people...

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hey Yuppie, I'm definitely not Issy but I can answer your question.The difference between Issy's levels and your are caused by brokers data feeds As you can noticed on previous page,Issy had 213.89 as high and 212.96 as low.His T1 target was at 60 so I presume he closed it a little bit earlier (maybe because of the price action which indicated that it wouldn't make "sixty") By the way Issy - great thread

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Nice trade Islander It seems likely to me UJ dropped so dramatically due to it hitting last week's 138% at 108.54. Pretty kooky time this past few hours. UJ shoots down after hitting the weekly 138% just as GU is shooting upward and nailing yesterday 161.8% to the pip...took some guts to short the gbp/jpy there amid the indecision of it's brethren.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Magnus - remember that I also watch UJ and GU and here we got the fast drop 'cause both were falling...UJ was approaching its Daily Pivot at 107.87 and GU was targeting its M4 line - I hit the exit button as UJ hit its level - I'm not always worried about the last pip or exact target level, especially this late in the European Session - also as has been mentioned, levels vary between brokers....

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thanks PT - I knew that it wouldn't take long for you to work it out - hope you got some pips too.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I have Vhand installed and i've learnt placing order, adjusting stop loss et al, big thanks to bluerudy for his professional tutor... BUt how do I, test I-fib on Vhands? Can anybody be of help

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thanks 24HT - it is amaizing how the levels do get hit - and in GJ and GU on a spike up fakeout / stop sweeping move that kills the breakout traders

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Thank you for your reply PT... Much appreciated... I am aware of the discrepancies in data feeds between MT4 brokers... I was mainly interested in the reasoning behind Islanders choice... Which I can see he as detailed below... Magnus

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Aaaaah... Clearer now... I was having difficulty seeing why you exited as GJ was reaching T1, as opposed to watching price-action around this area... I am still working through the other threads recommended and appreciate that I will, no doubt, find answers to my questions in there... It is, however, extremely beneficial to watch, and try and understand, what is happening in real-time as you guys talk and trade... Thank you Magnus

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Another relevent point is that I am trying to show a methodology, each trader will - and must - put his own interpretation into how he / she uses what is being shown. We are all individuals and "see" the price action differently - IMO its less stressful to accept some flexibility and remember that banked pips are always good pips. Leaving a few "on the table" shows "respect" for the market - to expect 100% is IMO the height of arrogance and the markets can be very humbling.....lol, just some Valentines Day ramblings after a couple glasses of a fine Rioja!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Issy, This is some of the best advise you could have given on this thread......... don't enter on the breakout, try to enter in the DZ or AL area, you have to get in cheaper than the 0/100 lines . Now everyone will have their own style and tolerances but getting in on the cheap is key. It gives you so much more flexibility in case it goes the wrong way on you. Imagine entering on the break of a 80 pip fib range and seeing price go up one or two pips and then all the way back down 80 pips to the other side........ughhhhh........I'd rather see it go down and only get about 20 pips profit out of it rather than have to mount an 80 pip rescue mission. An 80 pip rescue mission consumes a lot of $$$ and stress.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
This was a nice little bounce from the 50% fib... did anyone catch this?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
5M G/J AL and daily pivot providing some resistance.......will watch further, hope for a penetration and then a retrace back down a little for a good entry. Cable seems on an upward march already, UJ sideways just above 5M DZ.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
hey bud... what levels are your AL set at? is it 38 62? or is that dz levlelsthanks in advance

--- 帖子 #289 ---
AL = 23.6 and 76.4 DZ = 38.2 and 61.8

--- 帖子 #290 ---
took one position after bounce of 50 and break of DZ (212.56), took another (212.69) at AL area. Cable staying above 5M AL, UJ trying to get above 5M DZ.......

--- 帖子 #291 ---
quick question...do u set your fibs up like bo? do u and islander put a daily a retrace fib and an intraday? or just 2 fibs? how do u set up before trading?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
GM Pip - nice entry and its looking good.....

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi guys... here my trades from today... entered around AL and again just before the High of my fib...

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi piphitman I have a question ,can you help me on this please ? why didn't you enter trades short on showed attached image ? where you define you must go short or long ? thank you very much and islander hard work for IFibs

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I do set mine up somewhat like Bo. I use the 15M for my intraday but I will also place an intraday fib on a 1H chart too (like Bo's) but what I will do is sometimes narrow the 15M swing fib range to better suit a good DZ/AL range to observe PA. I guess my5M fib range is what Bo would consider the retracement fib. Issy has suggested a minimum of an 85 pip range for the 5M fib so I really try to stick to the 85 pip minimum unless of course conditions on the field change and call for a smaller range than the 85 minimum. Islander gave me a great tip a few weeks ago..........take a 5M chart and go back around 6-9 months on v-hands and watch what happens from Frankfurt open through the London session and look at the typical pip ranges.....Issy says there is a typical range of about 190 pips in that session for the G/J. I have gone back through v-hands and re ran those time frames to study up on the action during FO/LO. Those are the pips I want to make sure I am trading off of. I'm on PST so I can't stay awake for the whole London session so I really like the shorter time frames Issy trades.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi DG - whilst I got some ideas from Bo's thread, remember that he focuses on cable and only trades GJ when cable and UJ are moving in tandem. Here the idea is to continually walk the fibs, so whenever we see a new H / L AND a pullback starts. we'll walk the fib. Also, for the 5m I like to see a minimum range of ~80 pips - much less and I'd be on a 1m chart - and I try to avoid that! Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi JaG - your chart was drawn off a down move and thus we would be expecting that move tp continue DOWNWARDS and would be looking to SELL on the exit from the lower DZ line. However, price did exit the DZ and then stopped at the AL line, Alerting us to a possible reversal. Now I'm looking for confirmation as quite often price will range between the AL levels whilst deciding which way to go - here it exited upwards and became a buy. Reversals are always difficult and I need more research to confirm the best way to trade them. For now I'm cautious, hence waiting to see the exit and break of the "other" AL. Hope that helps - here with that 20 / 20 hindesight buying the bounce off the lower AL worked - lets do some research! PS are you a car guy? Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #298 ---
firstly, after your two white arrows, notice how price then went back up into the DZ (blue area) and then when it came back down out of the DZ area it failed to get to the AL line and it created a "higher low" candle.....WARNING SIGN. then it tried again...unsuccessful resulting in a doji pinbar (reversal signal) on the low attempt again. price then went back into the DZ and up to the other side and it kinda shot up. I still wasn't convinced because it stopped just short of the daily pivot so I figured a retracement was going to be coming, then when it came down to the 50 and no further I was in. hope that helps, price is kinda stalled at the M3 so if it goes no further I already have locked in profits becasue of playing it I-fib style.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
GM Issy, I read yesterday mornings posts after I left, I see you stayed and slayed the beast in impressive style yesterday. GJ

--- 帖子 #300 ---
out at 212.94

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks Pip - yesterday was good - now what the heck just happened to spook cable? - down 37 pips in 3 mins - I hope its the brokers playing about and not the start of a reversal...

--- 帖子 #302 ---
GM DXT - as usual, nice chart. Did I hear that you're leaving for a sunny and sandy spell in North Africa?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I was figuring that Cable and Eur would come in and kill the dollar later today after the shenanigans in the US yesterday rearing it's ugly head again. The bond insurers are in big trouble.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
thank you very much piphitman and Issy .

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Yes my friend...last day trading for an uncertain amount of days. From sunny Thailand to sunny Egypt... and hopefully then to sunny Maldives asap... I will have internet there Maybe a break will clear my head from Forex. 15 hours/day chart hypnosis for the last 12 months... the cold turkey will hit me hard next week! Cya guys as soon as possible! maybe a quick sneak in on Monday before my plane leaves

--- 帖子 #306 ---
It seems that we are in for a Freaky Friday - cable's got "ants in its pants" and UJs vibrating around its DP line - I'm sitting on my hands and waiting for some clarity. One of my esoteric sources says that today there is a cycle due that "often changes the direction of the market"....mm....TWT

--- 帖子 #307 ---
All the best for Egypt and thanks for your input here... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I'll miss your hourlys DX. Have a safe trip.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Islander, pip thanks for your responses... helps me see your jimmy buffet super ifib kung-fu much clearer..... very very nice method i must say.... i will study more this way of the islander... PS DX HAVE A BLAST ! ENJOY YOURSELF forget this stuff...its still here when u get back!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thanks mate.... here you go for another hourly As the price just touched DZ and trades above pivot and AL... I'm still in!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I closed half of both positions at T1 for +40 and +60 SL for both trades above the higher entry!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I thought that I'd posted this chart earlier.....couldnt resist a small buy off the 50% line, but I'm still cautious..... Edit: I'm out now on a tight stop - cable's sudden spikes down have made it a sell...

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Congrats DX for TP1 ! good trade ( like everyday for you )

--- 帖子 #314 ---
GU looked weak so I decided UJ is a safer bet here. In from around AL line, 138.2% target hit.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
good trade............two four

--- 帖子 #316 ---
very nice Issy, I didnt see that doble bounce off the 50, I was too busy beating myself up for chickening out at 212.94 edit: 112 pips move already "before" London.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
SL hit... out with another +1 and +25

--- 帖子 #318 ---
very whippy action here - it was a sell on the break of the lower AL at 9687. Looking at the action, I'm taking today as a "hit and run" day and will be locking in pips early with tight stops and probably exiting when I see a fast spike - this may be the start of a larger reversal.....Time Will Tell

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I agree Issy, lots of long wicks, short spikes, hard to make sense of any real direction yet. I think I'm going to pull in my tent and call it a week, keep my pips and get to bed. I don't want to ruin my 5 consecutive days of plus pips on the I-fibs method. I'm very satisfied for the week. Good luck heading into NY. great trades this week everyone.... Thanks again for starting the thread Islander. have a nice weekend.....

--- 帖子 #320 ---
i see uj up and gu down...so gj slightly up .... is this what u see too? PS target on uj off weekly fib is around 108.87 so watch that level...sure to be some action IMO.... PS its friday! good strategy issy on friday... bank them pips quik! u r a very wise captain pippirate arrrrrrrrghhhhhh

--- 帖子 #321 ---
you too and thanks for your posts......c u on Monday http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #322 ---
LOL - it comes from too many losses before I found Skunny's thread! No data till the US session, so this morning its pips in the bank asap for me!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
OK - here's what I see on UJ - it was a buy earlier on its reversal up out of the Yellow DZ and the break of the AL line - with another chance as it came back down and bounced off the top of the DZ. I'd normally have the salmon fibs on my 15m chart.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I've had a couple of quick trades in cable - here was the last set up - again I'm out and now flat.....FF trading!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Nice trade Issy. How do you enter trades like this that barely even make it into the DZ? Did you enter right as the red candle formed?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Good question - the wide red candle just before the low showed selling pressure, then we had a slow grind up, so as soon as price touched the DZ I sold - also the Daily Pivot is at 9681 - as I've said I'm in and out quicky today, just using the DZ and not waiting for T1 etc - Freaky Friday trading - darn but its hard work!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
gu.... u getting this one?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Oh very cool, determining buying weakness and seller control due to slow retrace up. There's nothing I love more than entering directly on a fib level for maximum precision. Question though(sorry another one ), where would you have set your stop or bailed out of that trade had it gone long after you entered? Im guessing maybe at the other end of the DZ, the 61.8%?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
This fib is on a narrower range than I like on the 5m chart, but the idea is to zoom in on the possible reversal....here, the sell is on the final break of the lower AL line - tighter range = tighter stops AND closer attention to the chart and trade...hit and run

--- 帖子 #330 ---
UJ MAY be joining cable's down move - its just broken under its M3 line. IF it confirms this and continues down towards its DP at 108.01 then GJ should get down towards the 212 area....TWT

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Possible reversal

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Yep, I have the same fibs - I didnt add them to my last post to avoid clutter...I'm thinking that now we'll sit for 30 mins with no action and then move 50 pips in a couple of bars.....I hope that its down!! Edit: LOL - it was! - I've taken some profit at T2 and looking for T3 on the remainder

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Short from AL

--- 帖子 #334 ---
That is on GJ, is it? Not UJ

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Closed half at T1 for +70 The rest for a free ride down Nice last trading day

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Whoops - I have both - a wider range on GJ and yours on UJ - trying to keep up and trade is hard this morning! GJ has now passed T3 as UJ pushed well under its 108 level....

--- 帖子 #337 ---
WTG DXT - great trading..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #338 ---
It now looks as if T4 - the 2.618 extension at 211.49, also the S1 level - will be hit next...cables holding at its T1.....a bounce would be nice to allow us to reload.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Edit: FYI, T4 on the narrow Yellow fibs is T1 on the wider range fibs..

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Out with the second half at the S1-T2 cluster for another 90 pips.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
That's super trading and great lesson to us all about watching the higher TFs and having patience - I'm already considering moving up to the 15m chart - just have to finish some more back testing.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
5m, also showing the earlier, wider range fib - salmon - mentioned previously. For me, the narrow range Yellow fib served its purpose of showing an early entry for the possible reversal - the sell at 213.77 ran down 125 pips with hardly a pause - some change from the initial chop, which I guess was a good indication of the possible reversal. Time for a break - BIB.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Next week I hope to look at more charts like this...T2 is 190 from the DZ...

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hey boys and girls, What a run today. The BIG PICTURE again, in 15 minutes with the high and low of yesterday. Enjoy all your week end and happy pips ! Thanks for this simple method

--- 帖子 #344 ---
you're welcome Yep, now that I'm happy with the methodology and others are too, I'm moving to the 15m next week - that fib on the 15m posted earlier ran 240 pips - same chart that you have - less work and seems to catch the moves well http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #345 ---
KISS : Keep it Stupidly Simple or Keep it Super Simple. That's not the army way, but that's my way ! Hooah !

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Yep - KISS with this is great - as I'm getting ready for the weekend - Saturday is a puter free day in my house - I'm just walking the fibs on the 1 min and taking 20 / 30 pips a trade.....just a little more practice.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #347 ---
this was the last 1m that I took - wasnt looking and so missed the first bounce off the DZ, waited and saw the higher low and so went in and took a clear 20 pips in the magenta line - it will probably go higher , but this was just a "hit and run" trade off the DZ Edit; it did - a nice graveyard doji spike on the 5m took it above 211.80, close to T2 on that 1m chart.....

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I finished for the week - plenty of great opportunities - I can see more than 200 pips each day from the charts posted - great weekend to everyone, back on Monday for Frankies open....

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hey Islander have a great weekend. You sure have owned the market this week ..leave some for the rest of us. I've enjoyed following your thread very educational. Can't make the fibs work like you but got a nice short from the 50% retrace of the move down at the 80 level. We may see new lows made over the weekend so I will hang on to some, as usual time will tell. Regards.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi Islander, Where do I find your fib tool (IFibs), I found DZ Box in attachment, but it didn't work. Or maybe any template to make charts like yours. Thanks for sharing

I'm busy at the moment or I would give you the post #, but wanted to help. There is a post in the last 5-10 pages with the fib indicator code. Basically you draw the fib from MT4 using the fib retracement tool and then copy the name from the properties&gt;common&gt;name box. Then paste that name into the appropriate location in the fib indicator code in MetaEditor. Compile it. Then when you go back to MT4 your DZ area should have a rectangular colored box. From this point when you walk your fibs, the box will update to the new location as soon as there is a tick change.

HEY ISLANDER - YOU KEEP TRADING LIKE THIS AND YOU ARE GOING TO OWN THE ISLAND AND THE YACHTS !!!!!! oh - sorry - I was yelling - too excited congratulations - see ya

I read somewhere in the Skunny post that he have opned his own forum. Anyone know the URL?

Send me a PM - I dont think we're allowed to post it in the open thread.

Thanks PPP - I see that you're doing rather well yourself!

Hi Islander, I've been reviewing the various trades in the thread and trying to understand your entry rules a bit better. You said earlier on (post 265) you usually enter at exit from the DZ. In this (post 272) it looks as if you didn't take the indicated long based on exit from DZ at 213.50 after bounce of the 50% but took the short only based on break of the AL at ~213.15. In what instances do you trade from DZ exit, and which do you look for break of AL? Thanks for the great thread .

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi JaG et al, I've noticed that price will often spike through the AL a few times then head back the other way. One thing I've been looking at with regard to when or when not to enter the trade is looking for a close above / below the AL (dependant on direction), not just a penetration - in this case would have looked for a close below the AL. This then becomes the reference candle, and entry is then at a break of the reference candle's high / low by a couple of pips within 2 - 3 bars. If price is too close to the 0/100 line at the trigger of entry I may then look for a retrace to get a better price. This is still "under test" as I've got a lot of VHands time to go yet, but looks initially to keep you out of a lot these sort of false breaks of the AL.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Shandy, Looking at your chart the first thing I notice is that your fib range is only 65 pips. look at the fib range posts for that day (Feb 13) compared to your fib range on your chart. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=106 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=107 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=108 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=110 on the 5M you want to have at least a 80-85 pip minimum range to work with. I try to look for a high/low range between NY close and Frankfurt open that fits these guidelines. Sometimes we may have to wait for a swing to be completed in Frankie/London before being able to set up a fib range, it just depends. Very rarely do I try to trade during the Asian session unless there is some real action going on. I'll have my charts open but I wont do anything but look at them until it gets closer to Frankfurt/London time.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
just watching this 15M and 5M on GBP/JPY waiting to see if price breaks below the AL on the 15M, or maybe another bounce off the DZ on the 5M........

--- 帖子 #360 ---
GM all Cable has been the early motivator, giving a clear Sell as it exited its DZ at 9624 - will it break its Asian low? UJ has been sideways in its DZ since Fridays close, leaving GJ to follow cables lead. However, GJ failed on Friday afternoon to follow its Sell after turning at the 50% level, it then put in a higher low. NB Fridays low of 210.31 was at the 50% line on my hourly chart. In the early Asian session, GJ held at the AL for an even higher low, so its starting to look as if GJ is going to reverse and become a buy...TWT

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Since USD/JPY seems to be asleep it's clearly GBP/USD pushing the Dragon. Possible setup...

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi Pip - and I was thinking that you'd be taking a vacation over your long weekend - guess you cant resist chasing a few more pips!! I'm waiting to see what the Brits want to do at LO.....the sell in cable was a nice entry... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Shandy - please send me a PM when you're on line and I'll look at your post - I'm busy now with FO / LO etc

--- 帖子 #364 ---
took that bounce off the DZ @ 211.29 for a short position, price took off so fast downward didn't get order placed until 211.15, price stalled a bit at 0 line and daily pivot then took off to TP1. Issy, I'm with you, I'm thinking an up day too.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Cable's just hit its 15m T1 - a fall of 116 pips since 05:45 GMT. I wonder if it will get pushed under 9500 to take out the stops and then reverse.....

--- 帖子 #366 ---
GM Issy, We'll vacation next weekend after the crowds are gone from the ski areas. Once again, I see that after I went to bed early on Friday morning, as ususal the big short opportunity came along so I had to make sure I got some of the London session today since there will be no NY session.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
That makes good sense....and you'll have grabbed some nice pips today before going to bed..... I have a note from my friendly esoteric trader that tomorrow and Thursday are expected to be volatile.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon11.gif .....TWT

--- 帖子 #368 ---
it looks like U/J wants to get the LONG party started but Cable is being stubborn at the moment, I think your right Issy, I think Cables just playing along till it can get it's stop sweeping done below 9500 before it lets the party begin.......we'll see

--- 帖子 #369 ---
The low in UJ on Friday was a clear buy off the hourly chart at 107.46 and this has been confirmed on the lower TFs too - now I'd like to see cable decide if its finished with the 9500 level or if its going to have another try to push under....

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I've drilled down to the 5m to see if it will show an early entry of this 89 pip range fib...... Edit: I've taken a partial position long off the touch of the 50% line / 211.00 level

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Islander, mate from where you have your fib drawn on this UJ chart u posted last? Thanks again for the answers ))

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Thanks for pointing it out - that was an experimental chart - I've edited the post.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Thanks for the reply Pipman. I realise the swings should ideally be minimum 80 pips but I was referring to the query JaG had about the spikes out of the AL and my observations about managing these, the example I used being the fib range he was referring to in his post

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi Thank you very much Shandy for your reply.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Regarding JaGuars query.............. your chart was from Wed. Feb 13. My chart that JaGuar referred to was from from Friday morning Feb 15. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=294 one thing that I failed to mention in my response to JaGuar when he asked why I didn't go short on his two white arrows, previous to my going long. I rarely trade in the Asian session, and if you look at the candles in that chart you can see why. there typically just isn't the volume until it gets closer to Frankfurt open. I was watching the chart but then all of a sudden at around 5:30 GMT there was some good price action, otherwise I would have waited till around 6:30-7'ish to consider trading.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
After yesterdays US holiday, the shorter TF charts are confused. On the hourly and 4 hourly, GJ has pulled back into the DZ and on the hourly chart is now at the 50% level, from which it can frequently be expected to bounce - as yet there is no confirmation from the lower TFs.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
looks like there's a fire sale on the yen right now...........at what point will the Yen buyers relent?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hehe. Sure doesn't look confused anymore. I am a graduate of Skunny's Academy and DXTrade pointed me here. Do I read the whole thread or just jump in at the end? Cheers

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Here we can see the recent fall in UJ, which is now at the bottom of its DZ, whilst cable has been sideways since yesterdays sell off and is now rallying up to its DZ

--- 帖子 #380 ---
5M G/U, working its way up and out of the DZ, now looking for a breach of the "0" and a take out of the Daily Pivot, maybe that'll get things going for GJ?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Here we see the quiet US and early Asian sessions on the 15m with a sell on the exit from the DZ at 211.45. However, I would like to see new lows soon IF this move is to get down to its T1. On the 5m there has just been a sell out of the DZ at 210.44, which has yet to break its zero line at 210.06. Thus we have support just above the 210 level and need to see IF this holds for a possible reversal - OR if it breaks and price drops to hit the current targets...lets see what the LO brings......

--- 帖子 #382 ---
GM Pip - I have the same 5m GU chart - this is its third attempt on the 9534 level....LO should decide the direction......GJs failure to break the 210.06 low is a sign of a weak fall, thus showing more probability of a bounce...TWT

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I agree, GU finally broke thru pivot.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Now is cable pulling back for a run at its DP? or is it following its 15m chart and is a Sell from the 9533 level....I'll wait and see.... Edit: The 15m Sell became active and GU retraced all of this bounce. Again, the the 9470 area is so far acting as support...

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi Steve - thanks for dropping in. As a graduate from Skunny's thread it wont take you long to work out what we're doing here - just a variation that made the fibs clearer for me. Happy pipping Islander

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Islander I have been a very keen reader of your Thread since it's start. I am a great believer in the Fib lines that can control price movements, especially with the GY cross. I have conbined some of the interesting work by Vegas (who also had some good and interesting ideas) and created moving Fib Lines for GY. I use GFT charts and I can send you an email of the charts , if you wish. Or can you tell me how to place a chart on the thread Fibs provide the answers

--- 帖子 #387 ---
the vegas tunnell?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yes, fib lines at distances from central tunnel. But I have changed the fib distances to work for the GY cross. I have set up fib lines at 38,50 and 62 from moving central tunnel of 156EMA GY works particularly well because it likes to move in 100 pip moves

--- 帖子 #389 ---
The Brits sold cable from its test of its Daily Pivot at 9537 and that gave another sell off the 5m GJ chart and now we are getting new lows in GU, UJ and therefore GJ - although IMO this is not yet a strong down move.... Edit: the 15m T1 is at 209.17

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi FxN - can you post them here - most of the followers here are experienced fib users. If that's not possible, then just send me a PM. Thanks Islander

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Cheers Issy; I will read the lot, and enjoy it.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Fibs is great! TP @ +50; +75; +110 And yen is going to T4...

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Both cable and UJ made new lows a little under 9472 and just under 107.26.....both levels have now been recovered. This made GJ fall 170 pips from its sell on the last exit from its DZ at 210.44 and has now retraced into this 100 pip range DZ - the 15m range is 195 pips... I'm now waiting for the Europeans to have lunch and for the US traders to arrive....

--- 帖子 #394 ---
On what time frame are you placing this tunnel?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Nice one GP.....T4? - TWT http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #396 ---
GJ getting out of DZ to the upside on 5m

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Agreed - cable's leading the way up and has also just broken out of its 5m DZ to the upside. UJ's not as clear yet.....I'd like to seeGJ pull back into the DZ and THEN a reversal up to be happy with a buy in GJ

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Not Fibs, but here are some interesting Gann lines coming onto play and this mornings low was 2 hours off the 144 hour time line.....

--- 帖子 #399 ---
There has been very little pull back since this morning's low, so I took the buy as GJ broke upwards out of its last 5m fib at 209.77 - the upside T1 has already been hit with price so far peaking 4 pips under T2. Edit: 210.69 is the next target - the high just after LO

--- 帖子 #400 ---
As I mentioned earlier, looking at the 5 min chart there was insufficient pull back to find a long entry. Here's a way of getting an early entry if you suspect that a reversal may be taking place. Drill down to the 1 min chart and try to place the fibs on a ~50 pip move from the H / L. Here's how it worked out this morning....the first bounce up was into the DZ followed by a sell which FAILED to get down to the 208.75 low. GJ then moved up to just above the upper AL AND pulled back into the DZ. The buy was when price re-broke the AL - at ~209.14 and from there it has rallied 140 pips.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
hi, i am new here, after reading from the first post and have tried to attach dzbox 0.0mq i got nothing. i mean the indicator not appear on my chart. could anybody please attach the indic or template ? and could you please expalain the rule of entry and exit? thank you for very much, and sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #402 ---
From the first page in this thread: This thread is for students from Skunny's Thread who wish to walk the fibs on 5 min and 15 min charts of USDJPY, GBPJPY and GBPUSD . and All the answers about this methodogy are found in those threads, so please do your homework before asking basic questions Please do your homework, that way YOU will then be able to benefit from the 1000s of hours it has taken to research and develop the methodology. Good luck Islander

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I figured I should post a chart and see what people think. Earlier the market was ranging quite a bit. I drew my yellow fib line and watched the market bounce between the DZ twice, creating higher lows. The bounce from the 50% level prepared me for an entry and I entered long at the DZ. I wasn't too comfortable with the trade and pulled out once I hit 30 pips. The second next bounce from the DZ would have been another great entry, once again another higher low, too bad I was in class. Now I drew a new fib on this swing of 113 pips, waiting for a retrace and looking to see what direction we should trade.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Works best with the 15min chart

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I see that an hour ago, GJ bounced up off its 50% line at 209.80 for an early buy - I'm now trying to get in off the 1 min. UJ 15m has a similar chart with a buy off its 50% line at 107.69 whilst cable has bounced up into its DZ and is holding around its Daily Pivot at 9490 Edit: Big spike down in cable puts my buy on hold.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
took a 5M GJ position outside of the AL and followed it down to T1 step for step with UJ 5M, while cable came in to help out with a little downward surge for good measure.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
The bounce off the 15m 50% line failed and the 5m showed a sell at the DZ, so I'll stay with the 5m charts until a clear direction is established

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Nice one Pip - I was busy getting myself updated, posting charts etc and missed the 5m sell - there'll be another trade soon! Edit: I'm having trouble posting charts - I have my latest 5m DZ from 209.63 to 209.87 Edit: I took the Sell at the 50% line 209.74

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Issy, I'm glad to see I had the same 15M and 5M charts as you had. While watching the 15M earlier this morning it was looking like a possible long day till that 50% failure...........will have to wait and see what the London Boys have to say about things.....

--- 帖子 #410 ---
latest 5M G/J DZ.....

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Agreed - remember the MPC of the BOE's minutes are due at 9:30 GMT - 55mins time. These are important so expect cable to be choppy until then. I'm in "hit and run" mode taking 30 or 40 pips as soon as I can and probably wont trade again until after 9:30

--- 帖子 #412 ---
looks like whenever U/J runs out of gas, that Cable is ready to short GJ......

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Some1 took this short @ 50% fib (re-test) ?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I've been waiting for the US data and now for the markets to settle down

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Seems logical, price struggle alot to settle at the moment.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Then there's the FOMC minutes later at 7pm GMT - GJ could range until then

--- 帖子 #417 ---
The best move today was the sell in cable from an earlier chart - the magenta line was the trade. Now price is back in the DZ. After the sell off in the early Asian Session GJ has been chopping around in a 120 pip range - lets hope for some direction tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
A couple questions. How long did you hold that Cable trade? Did you scale out, taking the majority of profit where safe and letting a smaller portion of your position ride it all the way? I don't see any other way to ride a move like that from start to finish. Also, I noticed your fib has unfamiliar markings on it, AZ, DZ etc. What is that and where do I go to learn about it?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Jared, Go to Skunny's thread here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=60272 to research and learn about how Islander draws his fibs.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
a look at the 15M pre-Frankie. GU has hit it's T1, GJ is on it's way to hitting it's T1, UJ hovering above the AL. edit:** also, some high impact GBP news to look out for this morning (retail sales)**

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi Jared - I dont post any trades - just the total move from the entry points - and yes, I scale out of trades and also lock in profits early. I've just renamed the fib levels - the 38 and 62 are the Decision Zone - where price decides to reverse - or not. The 23 / 76 are the Alert Lines and T1, T2 etc are the extensions. These are all ideas gained from Skunny's and Bo's threads and explained in prior posts. Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #422 ---
GM - up too late to get in on the start of the last move, so now doing a rescue mission with a buy on the retrace!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
looks like another one of those days where cable and UJ are in complete opposite direction of each other......drove me crazy watching it yesterday. Maybe "if" retail sales take a bite out of Cable they'll both be on the right track.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
still undecided on GJ???? have taken a few real quik scalps on UJ but otherwise just kinda waiting for a direction to pop up somewhere, anywhere.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
T1 and T2 hit, rescue mission accomplished http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #426 ---
and then some.......heh

--- 帖子 #427 ---
T1's hit on this 15m chart.....now to see if there's a retrace on a lower TF to allow another buy......

--- 帖子 #428 ---
A pull back to the 50% line = todays R1 level at 210.80 would be very nice...the equilivent chart on cable puts its 50% at 9505....

--- 帖子 #429 ---
When News Trading was still viable - 6+ months ago - we would fib the start of the news candle to the spike H / L and then look to get in on the retrace. I was too slow to put up this fib as I was on the 5m chart - but just look at that entry....sweet

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Here was the buy on the retrace back to the 50% level.....lets see how far it goes.....

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I hope you got out before that big drop on UJ

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thank you, I was suspicious when it past the 107.28 high, but couldnt make it to the 108.36 high. The unexpectedly poor Philly Fed data sent UJ down hard - without me onboard. Edit: Now to wait for the retrace.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Yesterday mornings UK data was positive for cable which spiked up and continued on up throughout the day. Yesterday afternoons US data was negative for the dollar which had a big spike down and has since slowly made it back up tpwards its DZ. This has left GJ following first the pound and then the dollar and it is now back in its DZ - waiting to see which of the majors will lead it next. When the majors are moving in opposing directions IMO it is easier to trade them rather than GJ.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
those are the levels I am watching also

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Off the 5min I'm seeing an equal high in UJ - just under its 15m DZ and 2 lower highs in cable. These have made 2 lower highs in GJ. GJ now on its Daily Pivot at 210.84 - I'd like to see a bounce before trying a small sell....

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Patience works! Nice Sell off the 50% line on this pull back Edit: the better than expected Euro PMI data has spiked the Euro up and cable's following....more patience needed!

--- 帖子 #437 ---
The 5m cable gave a buy off its 50% retrace and UJ gave a sell of its 5m DZ - lets hope that cable's buy was a short term signal caused by the Euro and the UJ now makes new lows under 107.16....lol, its Freaky Friday again!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I exited my GJ short when UJ hit its T1 at the 107 level - now to wait for the retrace....

--- 帖子 #439 ---
For me its a real Hit and Run day - take 20 pips whenever I can - 5 of these and I've hit my daily target.....

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Latest fib was from 211.18 to 210.26 - the 50% was hit at 10:22 am for a sell with another 20 pips proft already taken.... Edit: these 5m and 1m retraces to around the 50% level are being made in GU, UJ and GL - and good for these 20 pip trades.....:-)

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Five 20 pip scalps in GJ alone all from the short term pull backs that I've talked about all morning. Then this double bottom on the 1 min was the heads up for a possible reversal. GJ went up and then obliged us yet again by pulling back into the DZ before the nice 64 pip run back up to the 211 level. That's more than 150 pips in todays European session - a good weekend to all - I'm finished posting. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks Belekas - I hope that you and the other regulars have found it helpful - and yes, I'm doing my homework too! This week I'm going to have less time to post, so I do hope that others will find time to post their thoughts. I'll be in after London Open tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks PPP - I hope all's well. Issy

--- 帖子 #446 ---
With cable bullish on all of its longer time frames and UJ bullish on its 5m this was a great set up for GJ. I exited at T1 and am now waiting for a pull back. Support is just above the gold DZ, so GJ may not get down into the DZ, so I'm prepared to buy higher. The Existing Home Sales data is due at 1500 GMT - its important, so if I'm in a trade I'll probably close half before the announcement.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Here is an ej buy from earlier this morning, UK time, 5m chart. The yellow fib is the overall swing; the turquoise fib is the one I traded, both on a 1h chart. I didn't walk a 5 minute fib but drilled down to the 5m chart to time the entry on the first candle to open above AL; the green arrow shows the point. This trade cannot turn into a loser as I have a +16 sl now. There is a convergence of the two fibs at 159.59 that is acting as support, so every chance of a continuation to Target1? Any comments from the experts here is most welcome, especially with regard to anything else I should have considered. I am still at the stage of expecting to wake up and find that success with fibs was all a dream and I am still firmly a member of the 95%. Many thanks for starting this thread Issy. I really appreciate the time and trouble you have taken.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Nice trade Steve - thanks for the chart.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Here's a cable set up that I've just taken profit on......these IFib entries are popping up eveywhere today...... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Here is my take on the same chart, although demo not live this time. Very pleased to see my chart is not all that different from yours. I got in at the first candle to open above AL, for +25. Could I have known enough to get in sooner? Ps, my live ej is still running - +50 right now with a tp at +70. Here's hoping.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
The safe way is to enter as price exits the DZ - so here ~9645 + your spread However, with practice you can be more aggressive and use the 50% level.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Nice one. Did you enter on a break of the long AL after the initial test of the DZ and/or a later break of the DZ?...be interested to find out what your decision making was as this one progressed through the inner fibs. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Cheers. I feel some more vhands coming on.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I was tied up with other work and entered late (for me) on the exit of the DZ. Run a few backtests and you'll soon find what works best for you. Also I'm still taking profits early until we get a break of these ranges.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
My ej long just hit Target1- +70. The yellow fib is the big swing (can hardly be seen here). The blue fib is the one I was trading live. The salmon fib is one I drew to see if I could make some extra demo pips on a retrace; +22 on that one, entering as soon as I could after the price retraced to the DZ and bounced out. Lovely. Since I wrote this, the price has screamed towards T2,so soon be time for some more fibo walkies.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
A nice clear set up off this chart.....theDaily Pivot just helped to confirm the long entry - good for 50+ pips out of the 85 that were on offer.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Whoops - here's the chart.... Edit: with the continuing chop I'm taking profits early - here my target was the M3 level - GJ and UJ will often bounce between the Pivot Levels....:-)

Islander Good morning Quesion re Daily Pivots. What time do you use as the start time for your Daily Pivots? Thanks

I use the NY close - as taught by Dove Alliance in his posts on the UJ thread, and I use this indicator:

Another great set up....again for 50+ pips out of 80

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Nice trade man. What are thes IFibs you speak of? I havent seen them in either skunny's or Bo's thread? Is it an indie or just a way of renaming/pulling your fibs?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
LOL - its been posted many times here and in Skunny's thread - just a way of renaming the fibs to make them easier for me - and a few others too. Check a few of the earlier pages and you'll soon find plenty of info... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #463 ---
The green arrow shows a gu long I took earlier, on exit from the DZ if what was then the fib. What is now the 'buy' was the original Targer1, so the trade closed at +53 and I moved the top of the fib to where it is now. Since then, the price has retraced to touch DZ twice, and almost touch a third time. Would any of the more experienced here have re-entered long on any of these touches?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I was out at the time, having already banked profits on my earlier long entry - so all I can say is I hope so - it was a valid signal and we now know that it went up 60 pips to hitt T1.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

To my inexperienced eye, this looks like a good setup, with the price bouncing off the 50 several times, so I have gone long (demo, not confident of this live), emergency sl at 107.14 - got a 20 pip ts in case it gets to AL when I am not looking. The plan is to move the sl each time a resistance point is reached, then let the trade run. We shall see.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
A 20 ts might be a little tight, Steve, but you know what you can risk.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Cheers mom; it is only in place in case I miss the price reaching AL as I am also working away on vhands. It will come off asap.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi Steve - this is what I'm seeing - so far today, we have a Lower High AFTER the buy earlier out of the DZ. This for me is a Failure of a Long Signal and thus the first indication of a Possible Reversal. So I would be considering placing a shorter TF fib on this last fall and looking for a sell. However, I dont enter trades this late in the European Session, so I'll wait for tomorrow

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi Islander, your doing an awesome job here youve taken the basic principles and ran with it, developed your own style and it works for you....Nice Job!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I am trading naked. I want to join your group for the European session tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hey Bo - thank you so much for your kind words - coming from you they mean a great deal to me. As you've probably noticed, I'm a regular visitor to your thread and I never stop learning from your thoughtful and enlightening posts. Much of the practicle application of this methodology has come from your thread - thank you for sharing and for your time and hard work. Best regards Issy

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I look forward to seeing you for tomorrows session. As an experienced trader you should quickly see what we are trying to do and a little time spent reading through this thread will bring you up to speed. More in depth info comes from Skunny's and Bo's threads - but I guess that you already know that!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Anyone know what just put a rocket up cable - its up another 100 pips since around the European close and that IMO must have a reason - more than dollar weakness

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Cheers Issy; that was helpful. The trade sure doesn't look good right now.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hello all, I have been following Skunny, Bo and Islander for a while now. I am a lurker so I rarely post unless I feel I have something meaningful to contribute. I took the liberty of modifying the DZ Box tool. The mod works for me and I hope for a few of you as well . The source is included here so anyone can add further mods. The number one aspect of DZ Box that I felt needed improvement was having to enter the name of the Fibo you want DZ Box to work with. I draw my IFibs starting with the daily and work my way down to the M5. Nothing new there . I then set the Custom Indicator &gt; Visualization tab check boxes to the time frame I am on and the next lower time frame I deem important (ie. on the daily chart Visualization tab I set the Daily and H1 check boxes). This is done down to the M5 (or M1). I do check the M5 and M1 check boxes on the Visualization tab for my M5 IFib. The DZ Box mod simply finds the Fibo that is visible on the time frame you are displaying and, as long as that Fibo has the smallest range than any other displayed Fibo, it draws the box between its DZ lines. Hope it's worth the two hours it took to mod. EDIT: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS VERSION OF THE PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL DZ BOX PROG UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE PROVEN ITS PERFORMANCE TO BE SATISFACTORY TO YOU!!! Twenty years of software design engineering in both hardware and software and in the end I prove to be as useful as a rock! My apologies to everyone who grabbed the files I posted earlier. In my haste I grabbed the files from the wrong directory and viola...I'm an idiot . On the lighter side here are the ex4 and mq4 files. Please run this prog through its paces to verify it functions as expected. It is performing to my expectations, but your money is not my money soooooo.........

--- 帖子 #476 ---
GM Issey and everybody. Hope and wish all a good trading session Yesterday i made some nice pips with your iFib method on geppy and euroyen. ~200 per both pairs. Thats lovely mate I have a question if we get small swings like on usdyen we have right now how would you properly iFib them Issey? If you can please post a few charts of yours, that would be very very helpfull. Thank You Cheers!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks, I'll try it later

--- 帖子 #478 ---
GM all - cable's still got a rocket pushing it up and UJ's doing the opposite. This makes trading GJ difficult until one of the pairs stops moving. When its like this I prefer to trade cable as its moves are larger than UJs. There's been no real pull back in cable since it took off yesterday and its currrent target has to be the January 30th high at 1.9960 - also todays R1 level. I'll post a chart when I see a pull back. Edit: We should also remember that The Big Number - 2.0000 is now in sight....

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Everyone who is interested in the BZ Box mod please download the files again or for the first time from post 475. I screwed up and attached the wrong files...sorry! If it does not work this time somethings messed up on my end so please tell me about it as I want to make this right.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
sorry, wanted to post gbpchf trade i took yesterday...

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Great pips. Heres a 5m chart around the time that you posted. A continuation sell at the red arrow in the DZ. I've also walked the salmon fib - another entry there IF it drops down out of the DZ

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Here's another way of using support and resistance to draw fibs. This time I've used a Resistance level for the bottom of my fib instead of a support level. This gives a narrower range and thus more possibility of getting a retrace into the DZ - I got long as soon as I got up this morning http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Note how this has given a T1 level close to the two other levels that I mentioned earlier.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Using Fibs or pivots or support resistence as a add on guide / indicator is not trading naked! Even the use of trend lines to some is indicator land. the chart below is going naked!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
cmon mate, dont spam the threead with useless posts like this one, we call it naked, i call it naked, nobody asks for your opinion. we here on bussines not to discuss non-bussines related issues

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I was too busy earlier to post this chart. You can see the great number of wicks late yesterday and the chop in the Asian Session earlier this morning as GU and UJ battled for dominance. Finally, as cable took off again, GJ was a Buy on its exit up out of the DZ - will it break above yesterdays high? - TWT. Remember there's loads of news due out today - UK at 9:30 GMT and US at 13:30 GMT and 15:00 GMT, so its best to lock in profits early - I have http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Just a quick question Issey, as you see on this cable chart the new little swings high has been mate so my question is: when would you be mooving the fib to the new high and so on? Thank you for your answers! Cheers B.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
to bad buddy it's a free world and my comment directly relates to the thread topic.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Naked my ass! this is far from it. Naked trading is based on pattern of trend. not your indicators, this Thread is totally misleading! this is my last post. Guy's if the system works great i hope your all making heaps of pips but none of u have the right to say you trade pairs naked. I am sorry but that takes so much time, skill and study! Good trading

--- 帖子 #489 ---
What got into the yen? I rode up the G/J, and then exited. But I did not see the drop coming. I missed it.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
LOL - thanks for you helpful post. Now perhaps you might care to look at the first page and follow the spirit of this thread.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Anyone smell reversal down the yen path? Issey can you look at my chart i posted a few mins ago on cable and try answering my questions if you have a few free mins? Thanks! Cheers

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I do....my only question is...how much?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Thanks Mate! Cheers

--- 帖子 #495 ---
T1 hit http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Issey, you sold cable @ 9934 when exiting the DZ zone?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
DXTrade said to say, "HI!"

--- 帖子 #498 ---
sorry issy wrong thread lol YO ISSY THANK YOU FOR THE THREAD

--- 帖子 #499 ---
No I was busy elsewhere. I see your fib and the levels, when I suspect a reversal I'll wait for confirmation - check some of my earlier posts - and normally I would sell under the AL line. This time it was a strong break, but this is rare, more often you get some chop before it reverses.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Thanks Mom - regards to DXT - and you! - too http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #501 ---
LOL DG - you sure are busy today - nice to see you popping by!

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Loads of fibs to draw everywhere - I cant keep up and trade so wont try - just keep banking guys - these pips are slippery things!

--- 帖子 #503 ---
LOL, right! You guys are doing great! Congrats!

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Morning Issy, took the long on Cable this morning just before the 1.9900 breach. I've been busy for the last two days battling a SELL trade that was left down at 211.90 on GJ, that UJ drop really helped me rescue that one with some extra pips in the bank to make up for my swap fees for having it just sit there for two days.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
The current moves are dominated by weakness in USD, which has just made new 30+ year lows against the Swiss Franc. In addition we have the annual Yen repatriation for the Japanese Year End window dressing - thus Yen buying which puts further downwards pressure on UJ. Watch out for more fast moves in GJ whenever both UJ and GU are in step and falling simultaneously - as happened just after the London Open.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Could you tell us a bit more about this Japanese year end window dressing Issy? Things do seem a bit crazy on the yen now...

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Well done - I'm looking for a retrace to the 212 area for another sell - but remember this afternoons busy datawise and Helicopter Ben's also talking at 15:00 GMT

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I'll try to find an article on this - but basically most (all?) Japanese companies have their year end in April. As most are exporters and are paid in US Dollars, they need to change these into Yen and repatriate these funds to pay their taxes and "window dress" their balance sheets. Thus they are buying Yen and Selling Dollars. Edit: Thanks for the charts Edit: Remember that these guys are also currency traders and can Buy physical dollars and hedge by Selling in the FX and Derivative markets thereby delaying / obscuring the effects of their actions.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
with all these narrow range retracement fibs around right now....a quick 5M UJ scalp, entered on the AL @ 106.40, exited T1 @ 106.55. 15 pips on UJ....what I like about UJ..... it's only a 2 pip spread.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Heres the euroyen trade i took right on the bounce from dayly pivot and touch of DZ, any comments guys? Cheers

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Fine, but what's with all the clutter? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif The Skunny / Islander definition of Naked sure doesnt allow all that http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon13.gif

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Sorry master, wont happen again

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Took its sweet time but got there eventually.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I waited until the news was out and then these short trades came up.....as its around news time, both were hit and run for ~20 pips....

--- 帖子 #515 ---
We had a pullback to 50, maybe now theres a perfect place to sell geppy again? All comments appriceated Ps. Issey i cleared my chart as per your words The fib has to be a few pips higher, sorry for bad input.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
...does anyone agree with this GBP/USD (15min) fib long? Have a nagging suspicion the Asian - early London range is still playing out down side...wad 'ya reckon?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
issy's theme song&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Well the sell of 50 zone on geppy was sucesfull and my position is up 120pips Thanks again Master Issey for this good method Off to bed now, see yall @ FO. Cheers B!

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hello, I posted a similar inquiry on Bobokus' thread. Is anyone trading a Set and Forget daily method using these ideas? If so I would like to chat with you. Please PM me. Thanks. Lou

--- 帖子 #520 ---
GM everybody and wish yall great trading day Posting my current pound/yen chart for this morning. My iFib is set in 140pip range and we have some formations visible. When will we break short only time will tell. Q for the master, from what i see you dont pay too much attention to big numbers like .00 &amp; .50 because they work as psichological levels from what i know, so we have 210.50 not far below our price. Thank for your time Issey Cheers! PS. 2seconds after i posted it broke down LOL

--- 帖子 #521 ---
GM all - was busy grabbing pips in that drop - here's my latest chart I'm short again at 52 and will add if it goes higher Edit: I took a hit n run 20 pips looking to re-enter

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hey Belekas -great trading - your hard work is paying off!! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif Edit: I do watch the 100s and the 50s - they also are important - once I used just trade the 100s, so when a fib is near its extra confirmation

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Yes i took 47 pips in that drop minus spread 7 of mine, i got like 40. Im short as well Issey Lets see how our trade goes

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Thanks for your kind words mate and for the answer I hope im starting to see the sun! I closed this geppy trade by accident, i think from all the excitement lol Now i must look for another opportunity to enter again...

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi Lou - we're mainly using the 15m and 5m charts, so I dont think any here can help - but I'll be interested to follow your progress for when I'm not able to spent time close to my computer. Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #526 ---
LOL - and I dont even have a cat any more!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I got 40 too - and now another 20..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif I'm holding for now whilst Ujs moving up - and I'm also watching cable to see what happens at its 9800 level....

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Interesting, price blasted thru 50 level, it might now leave a nose poking out like a pinbar then i think i have another opportunity to enter short, correct me Issey if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Islander, can you post your usd/yen chart when you have some free time. Thank you. Cheers! ps. You got 60 me 40 on geppy, you number 1! I had that sell as well but somehow didnt take those 20pips and left them for the market, as respect lol

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Here's my UJ chart - its been sideways in a 40 pip range for 16 hours with a 1 pip higher low in the 7am candle. At the moment, all of GJs action is coming from cable's moves. Edit: UJs Daily Pivot is at 106.57 - not shown on this chart, but important.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Posting my cable chart. Do you have your 0 fib @ where i have it placed or lower @ where is my AL line? Thanks for the usd/yen chart! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #532 ---
and here's my cable chart - I also have a 5m chart with fibs on the last fall - its DZ is from 790 to 812

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I have the same chart - any small difference will be from brokers feeds

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Now whilst UJ is grinding its way up to its Daily Pivot and cable's sideways in its DZ I'll just wait for the next clear set up. Edit: We also have cable around its 9800 level and GJ around its 211 level, so all three are at "decision" levels - will they bounce or fall?.....Time Will Tell....

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Alright, missed the long from boune of 50 zone @ 210.63 so now im waiting for a pullback and then we will see what happens. You bought it Master Issey?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
This is a classic short term reversal - IMO revelsals are THE most difficult to trade and here I was still thinking short, BUT the higher low - i.e. the FAILURE to carry on down was the first sign that the direction MIGHT change - that's where I exited my short. Then the action around the Alert Line confirmed that it was changing and it was a Buy as it moved up away from that small area of conjestion. These are very difficult to see and to trade - and here I wasnt concentrating and so missed the opportunity of another 40 pips - darn it that would have given me my daily target already!

--- 帖子 #537 ---
hey issy.... dont forget to zzom out once in a while get your bigger picture and perspective helps a lot..... IMHO my view on uj she is going up to retest the neckline of her broker head and shoulders b4 falling again.... but u never know.... still i'd be careful when she gets up to that neckline area.... gj of course will follow her lead.... gu hit major resistance on its way up as u know.... so.... u know what is likely just my 2 cents bro keep on rockin!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
LOL - no I was too busy and not focusing 100% on my own trading - that's why from next week I'll be reducing my posts. I think I've now shown very clearly how the fibs can work on the 15m, 5m and 1m charts and I need to concentrate on my own trading. All who are interested can find loads of charts and explainations throughout this thread and with a little work should be able make their own charts and entries.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
GM Issy, question for ya, now that Tokyo is closed and UJ isn't budging up over daily pivot, do the London boys typically move that piar after Tokyo closes?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Yes no doubt about that Issey Theres more then enough information down here. Nice m1 reversal you posted, really nice

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Absolutly DG - I have 4hr and 1 hour up on separate pages, but have concentrated on the lower TFs whilst I have the time to be close to my puter. Thanks for the chart.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Pip - I've never done any research on the UJ alone - I would guess that it will depend on which pair the Europeans are concentrating on - IMO more often that's cable. I've attached a nice explaination of trading hours and volumes that may help everyone in deciding when to spend time by their computers. Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Alright, heres my Geppy chart for now. 211 still holding. Where are we going? Only time will tell Ps. depends how agressive you are and what is your targets

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Yep - I took a partial lot long out of the DZ - partial as I see conflict with UJ holding under its DP and cable above its 800 level - this is another hit n run trade, aiming for 20 / 30 pips Edit: With these trades as soon as I'm 10 pips in profit, my stop goes to Break Even + 1 - I'm darned if I'll give any pips back! Edit: so I'm now out!!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Lovely, just lo ve ly!

--- 帖子 #546 ---
A nice sell of the bigger ifib's 50 level. Good for 40pips by the time im making this post. Cheers! edit: no clear direction still, good for a few pips there and there but no bigger moovement so far...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Issey, today the market looks not good, why you think is this happening? Ups and Downs no straight direction. Because of the news comming on USD?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Since the 25 th of January GJ has been inside this rising wedge, with 213.90 as Resistance and support given by the rising blue Gann Line. The swings have been ~2 weeks, then three 1 week swings. Now the wedge is ~280 pips wide - a little more than the daily average - and GJ has to make up its mind which way to break. Thus as yet we have no overall direction - no trend to make life easy for us traders - and I've been in one very successful paid room where 500+ traders are patiently sitting for days without a trade. So far today GJ has fallen to just below the 4 hour gann line and since made a 113 pip bounce - almost to the 50% line on my latest 15 min fibs. Now we have cable rallying and up to its daily pivot with UJ falling from its DP - thus the majors in opposing directions and hence no overall market direction. In 30 mins we have the US GDP and at 15:00 GMT Helicopter Ben speaks again - perhaps one of these with start the next move. Also tomorrow is the months end, so if the Big Dogs need to move it before then, we can expect some action. TWT.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Can you post your latest 15m geppy chart, thank you.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Here you go....

Nice, i have your ifib on my chart same and you do Issey Ive posted just some posts above i think. Was a nice sell of the 50 zone i see now, sad i was @ the gym and missed it.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Thanks Izzy, just thought I would ask. You never know. Anyway will have to save this method for when I can be in front of the charts. Which according to the Hours/Volume chart is in the valleys of low volume . DRAT ! Necessity being the mother of invention... maybe I CAN come up with some kind of Daily method.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
GM everybody! The sell took off 210.15 nicely thru the nite. Hit T2. And went below it fot a total of ~222pips

GM Issey &amp; the crew Today @ 8:20 my time (gmt+2) missed this nice sell of the lower DZ zone for about 98-100pips (incl. spread), T1 hit . I was taking a morning shower and it hit me. Now we wait. edit: usdyen broke MS2 pivot and pushed geppy down, also cable is @ MS1 pivot.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
GM all - I have the same charts - here updated - now to see what FO and LO bring.... Edit: I hope that all of you guys who were trading the Asian Session got in on that excellent short signal - it fell 145 pips - I may have to start getting up earlier!!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
and here's the update....a retrace to the 50% level at 204.80 would be nice....

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Here's the narrow range 5m - we may have to trade off this rather than the 235 pip range IFib...... LOL - busy posting and missed that sell for 70 pips

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Issy GM....thanks for the reply on the PM. I took the 5M 50% retrace bounce and entered at the 50 @ 204.30 and took it down 25 pips and then closed it out....

here's cable.....

Nice sell of the 50% zone on euroyen. Good for 40pips, though was watching other things so i missed it...

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi Belekas, i am looking that You are near my country ;] Here is my UJ 5min chart. Am i right on drawing this fib for UJ 5 min? On yelow rectangle 50% touch it would be good reason for short ? In this case - price just didnt work on fibs? Thank You. Best, Tom

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Just to let you all know that I'll be reducing my posting due to other commitments. I'll still pop in from time to time, but will not be activly posting. Good trading to you all Issy.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
here was a great 5 min signal.....Buy at 204.45 on the exit from the DZ and it went up 120 pips.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Great trading Issy, ive missed this one as well and alot of others as well. I was so nervous for the ej i took today i had to quit trading for today and hit the gym to relax my body and mind.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
read this thread a few more times and you will start getting a feeling about how this works. ive spent hundreds of hours with my charts and now im starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, still we are human and make mistaked... I wouldnt take short on this touch no matter what. Personaly i would need more confirmation.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Here was a sell from lower DZ zone. Good for ~95points. Edit: T3 hit, T4 3pips left

--- 帖子 #587 ---
This is where I get a bit confused about what constitutes an entry - why wouldn't you have entered at the first exit from the DZ i.e. a short at 204.08 from the 11:35 candle? Or the next which was a bounce off the 50% (11:45) and then another exit (11:55). Obviously they would have been failed trades, but didn't they fit the same criteria for the long you mention i.e. exit from DZ?

I wasn't awake at the time Shandy but here's what I see. after the low was hit at 203.47 it also looked as if UJ had finally run out of gas and was either refilling for another rubber band snap or it was now heading upwards. But if you look at the lower lows on GJ after 203.47 it was not looking like a short trade scenario to me, price never really broke decisively below the DZ on the way down but as it tried to get below it between 14:30 and 14:45 it just couldn't get any lower.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
GM everybody. Here are my current m15 charts. UJ and GJ above DP. Cable below DP. On my charts DP line goes along the DZ line. So lets see what happens in the meantime. edit: also im watching hl's on uj and gj. i marked them with red lil lines. edit: was a clear early buy for me but i didnt take it as i dont trade that early, only FO and LO.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
An interesting morning - the Frankfurters pushed cable down and GJ followed to stop at a Gann Line in the DZ. The slightly positive UK news and back up it goes - but will it be able to break out above the 205.47 high? TWT

hey bud.... how about a lesson for dagoods in the secret room

Hi guys, My first post in this thread and i must say, its a great thread you started here Islander, well done. I have a couple of questions with regards to stop placement and trailing stops? When you take an entry when price comes out of the DZ zone, where do you place your stop? I believe there are a number of places: 1. Underneath the last swing low/high on the 5 min chart, if taking an entry from this timeframe. 2. Above/Below the opposite end of the DZ zone, although i think this may be a little risky? 3. Above/Below the 0 or 100 lines of the fib, this one being the widest stop and giving the least risk/reward but far safer. If you are going for the 382 extension, ie T1, then that gives just under a 1:1 r/r given the spread, if your stop is at the 0 or 100 line, anything else gives greater reward than risk. I also would like to know if you move stops up when it approaches the 0 or 100 lines, in case we do not get the penetration or do you simply wait for the T1 to be hit? Do you guys trail behind the 5 min swing points, maybe having scaled some of the position? I would be very interested in how you guys manage these trades with regards to these question. Quite a few of you seem to have mastered this very well and i would like to adopt a similar strat based on this. Cheers, Steve

This was an opportunity to add or get in - on the pull back into the DZ

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Well to quote Skunny, you place your stop where you would be looking to take a reversal trade. So as I work on getting into a trade before the swing point - the "00" level - I use the AL lines for this (the 23.6 / 76.4 ) levels. Thus I would place a stop say 5 pips the other side of the AL line. Also I believe in never allowing a profit to turn into a loss, so once I am 15 pips in profit, my stop goes to breakeven +1. After that I'll be thinking of a stop behind the next fib level, so as I write this with price just above the 00 level of 205.34 that would be the AL at 205.11 - say 205.06. I watch both the 100 levels and the pivots - now price is held by the M3 level at 205.44 - so its a judgement call to close IF price turns back down. Its easier if you are trading in units of 3 or 4 - that way you can vary your exits by taking a partial profit and leaving some to run. Hope that helps - its personal choice - do some testing and you'll find what suits you best.

Hi DG - I'll swing by later - after the ADP news etc http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #596 ---
thanks! yeah nothing seems to be happening till news anyways....

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi Yall, some hard trading days ah guys? took this euroyen long on the bounce of 50% . Watching r1, if it breaks next target 158 edit: while i was typing UJ broke m3 up into its DZ and pushed EJ thru r1, now it needs to break 157.80 and were good to go! edit: closed @ r1 with +20pips profit...though it might go higher, during such hard times 20 is ok!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi Islander Nice thread you got going here!! I also read and re-read Skunny's thread until I could recite his wisdom while trying to get behind cycles and walking fibs and what not. A question regarding entries ... do you enter on a rejection of levels in the DZ ... Isn't it a bit of gamble as price did not show any commitment regarding direction yet?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Thanks for the quick response Islander. That all makes sense. A quick review of the trade you took. I took more or less the same earlier but this was off the 15 but was stopped out at BE. I am now long on cable and have moved my stop up to BE on that one now, looking for 9840 for 1st TP. I like the stop placement behind the AL, makes sense. So with this current trade, if it had turned back around and come back down and hit your stop, would you have gone short, ie would that have been the short trigger? I need to carry out some testing i know, and from the posts, i can see that you have done a lot of that. I am used to trading the longer time frames and i always expect a pullback after my entry, especially on the beast. Moving the stop to BE after 15 pips seems a bit close on this pair, but the difference i can see is that you are getting in right at the start of the new move so it should move away pretty fast, otherwise i assume you want to be covering yourself, am i right? This is something i will have to get used to if i a going to be looking at these timeframes again. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1204728871

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Nicely aided along there by those ISM figures. The beast and cable hit T2, bugger those brokers who stopped me out earlier on the beast!!! LOL

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Its all about practicing on vhands and then starting with small lots till you gain confidence.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Steve - yes, 15 pips is close and I'm only saying that for the 5m chart in choppy conditionds. Here, the range of the fib might only be 70 or 80 pips and not giving the wider trend type moves. Experiment - you might prefer 25 pips or behind one of the other fib levels - its all personal and I'm just making the point about trying to keep positive pips - they're slippery things!!

--- 帖子 #603 ---
GJ - I took a buy on the bounce of DZ &amp; m4 on the 329pip range m15 ifib. Price went up nicely 60 pips to 50% of the narow range ifib. It needs to keep above r2 and break 207 level and were in for a nice ride. UJ took off after the big yellow m15 152pip range ifib's DZ bounced and went up 30 pips. Price now inside the smaller ifib - m5 80pips range- DZ. Needs to stay above r1 to go up. EJ took off the r2 but i bought on the bounce from the DZ on the 180pip range m5 ifib. Went up 50 pips to m5. Needs to stay above the r2 to travel up. 140 total pips on these *yen pairs edit: total of 230 pips was achieved by time

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Just posting my cable chart for you guys to see how well the fibs and the pivots get along Im ready for tommorows action, hope we will have a better day then today but worse then tommorow LOL ps. orange ifib is 245pip range m15 and yellow is 150pip range m5 ifib. notice how pivots line up with ifib's levels yourself GN everyone see you on FO/LO Cheers!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
GM Yall. Early sell on the touch of DZ on this geppy m5 132pip range ifib. Closed +40 Stopped on the yellow m15 336pip range ifib's upper DZ on the left. Are we going up already? Time will tell. Watching UJ and GU closely right now. edit: broke down nice, position would be up 70points...though its closed

--- 帖子 #606 ---
OK, news was as expected and we are good to go. Buy of the 50% exploded just a few mins after the news. 1st target r1 208.33 2nd target 209.50

--- 帖子 #607 ---
hi PHM, after reading manytimes i close to understand about the level. but i'm still comfused about the rule to OP/entry. should i put buystop at 0.618DZ and sellstop at 0.382DZ? and what is the meaning off AL? please guide me many tq

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Sflanwr, I believe the "AL" has the meaning of "Alert!." Some traders enter at the "DZ" (deternination zone) area; some at the "AL" (alert!) area. I think I am correct with regards to the meanings.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I would not put a buy stop or sell stop on any of these 5M trades, 5M not a very friendly set it and forget it type of trade IMO. I want to be right in front of my computer watching price. Example: If you are looking at a possible short position then you are waiting for price to break below and stay below the lower DZ area, it may be one candle, it may be 5 candles it just depends on your personal taste. (all the while you must be watching price action on Cable and UJ too) Once price has made it below and is staying below the DZ area then that is a higher probability short signal ready for an entry, or if you want to be more conservative you may want to wait to enter after price has broken below and is staying below the AL "alert line" area. I prefer to try and get in after the break of the DZ area so if the trade goes the other way on me I take less of a drawdown on a SL. ****EDIT: example of a 5M chart I am currently watching right now for a clean break of the DZ before going short, price has penetrated the DZ a few times but UJ seems to have hit bottom at 102.84 and may be heading upwards and Cable is just kinda ranging in a narrow price range. It looks like UJ will go up and Cable may come back down a bit which may just negate each others price action. If cable stays in it's narrow range and UJ shoots back up, this potential trade can turn into a long position quickly......patience is the key now****

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi guys, hows going? Heres my GJ m5 chart ive traded of today 1. I took a big buy on the 50% bounce of the yellow m15 335pip range ifib. Closed for 180pips. 2.I took a short of the touch of the yellow 96pip m5 fib on the right. Closed for 80pips. Not too bad

--- 帖子 #611 ---
well done belekas, I had a wrong fib on my 5M, It was way too large a pip range, I should have seen all 4 of those support hits right at the 206.65 line and placed my 5M support line there. That range was a perfect 5M range too right at a 100 pip range.....

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Thanks Piphitman

--- 帖子 #613 ---
so does the usdd/jpy go up or down after release tomorrow?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Sorry, cant help you with them news, im pure 100% technical trader mate Also here were trading yen naked, Islander's style.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
UJ is headed for the basement, already broke Jan 2005 support at 102.37, next level 101.60

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Yes, UJ is going to its s1 pivot @ 102.01 . Hope news today will settle some direction to the market. Piphitman whats your view for today?

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Belekas, you seem to be raking in those pips. Do you just shoot for the T1 area once in a trade or do you trail behind swing points? Is your stop behind the opposite AL line? Just wondered how you manage the trade once you are in it? Steve

--- 帖子 #618 ---
short.........

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Major support area area on weekly charts down to from here to 101, must bounce? Also how low will the bank of Japan allow it to go? 101 would be a 10+ year low. They have defended levels before so care needed, although this is $ weakness rather than JPY strength. Gordon

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Well im not using stops, im using pivots and they are really helpfull when it comes to exits, entries as well, in market like this its better take n run trading like islander mentioned, aim for some pips, reach your goal take them and leave the trade.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Posting my current m15 chart on Geppy. Piphitman, what do you think about the big fibs 50% yellow that holded 2 times, will it hold now? Lets ellaborate a little on this right now, i have some free minutes if your free lets make it happen This chart could have been traded nicely, i posted on Auslanco's GJ/GU thread some trades that i took. Will post here when i have more free time. So we short or a bounce from 50%? Btw, short of 50% smaller fib on the right was a nice trade...

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Nice sell of the 50%, if we missed it, market gave another oportunity when touching lower DZ and then the drop ~100pips from DZ...lovely

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Cable in a downward retrace, UJ headin for da basement, entered off the DZ minus 6 pip spread at 206.26, pop some patience pills, exit T1 @ 205.66. Good Morning London!!!!!!!!!!!!! ***EDIT: 15M chart posted......trade was placed on 5M chart due to narrow 93 pip range, ala Issy style ***

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Nice trading PPH!

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Thanks B, Looks like 1H is headed for T1 also.......... 1H had a good entry off of the DZ or AL, I got my 60 on the 5M and then chickened out....

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I entered of 170pip range m15 ifib i posted, its still going down...UJ going to its s1 and it might bounce or if we get close below it will go to m1, lets see what time will tell

--- 帖子 #627 ---
yup, good job belekas....... I'm waiting for this big fatty bear candle to finish so I can ride the retrace up to the 50.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Missed ej short of the 50%, damn nice trade. T2 still short by 2pips LOL edit:T2 hit and price stopped at s2 pip by pip, still pushing lower

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Would you elaborate on that a little when you get a chance. Like the trade this morning, where would you have bailed if it had turned on you? You seem to be letting them run, like yesteday, 180 pips.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Im watching closely UJ and GU when trading GJ. Also watching pivot's on UJ, they are helping us very very much. Yes im letting them run untill i see some possible end scenarios, like taking profit or closing half taking profit letting the other half run and etc. Watch these pivot levels and UJ carefully because it gives us alot of clues when to take profit and what can we get from the market if we keep on holding our positions. Cheers

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Ok, so you look to see what $/Yen is doing and cable. If cable is stagnant and $Yen is going down then Geppy will usually follow down, and vice versa. If both are travelling in the same direction then Geppy will fly in that direction, even better? Stick the pivots and mid pivots on $/Yen to see where that may stall, which would in turn stall Geppy? How about if cable is moving and $/Yen is stagnant. Do you use pivots on cable to look for possible stalling points on the Geppy too?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Looks like a triangle forming on the 5 min

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I use the pivots on all three pairs, IMO the Yen traders really like the pivot areas. I have open on my computer 6 charts, 2 of each pair, one 5M chart, and one 15M/1H that I toggle back and forth between 1H/15M for viewing and placing fibs. From what I have seen UJ affects GJ more than GU does. If Cable is doing nothing a one pip move in UJ will give us a 2 pip move on GJ, if UJ is doing nothing a Cable one pip move will give us a 1 pip move on GJ. When they both get going in the same direction...............hide the women and children............look out

--- 帖子 #634 ---
GM. At night placed a selllimit order @ 300 pip range m15 fib right on the upper DZ @ price 206.77, also this was blue m5 130 pip range fibs 50% zone. Order got filled and my TP @ FE 0.786 hit for 103pips. edit: blue m5 fibs T1 hit as im posting and now T2 missed by 2 pips

--- 帖子 #635 ---
nice job belekas, I was gone for this weekend and my brokers feed doesn't turn back on till Sunday afternoon (my time) so I didn't see any of the oval shaded area till I came home this evening and had my fib still left from Friday's mini swing after the big swing. I didn't get a chance to enter into this one but with keeping that Friday fib placement we had some nice bounces off the 50, the DZ and the AL before a nice run downward.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Yes Pph, was a nice move down, im waiting for the next entry, interesting what do the Brits bring us. Any predictions mate? UJ above its s2 pivot, cable looks like going down.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Cable had 3 solid days of up, up, up, ending last week on a high........looks like it may be retracing a bit. I was just watching a video on Bloomberg.com of some analyst from RBS who thinks USD/JPY will go down further to 100 this week......he doesn't really think there will be any intervention at those levels. I'm dead tired from being gone all weekend.....I'm gonna get some sleep and get back at it tomorrow. Good luck......

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Have a good sleep mate, and let us know when you get back. Im waiting for a big drop on GJ, a really big drop

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Nodody wants to master this lovely Issy's method or im posting here alone?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
3 ifib trades today, the last short from 50% @ 206.32 hit T1 @ 205.61 and goes for T2. T1 ~87 pips. Anyone from you guys have Pivot points indicator with TimeZone setup option and possibility to turn Off the Sunday's data?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
It looks like a great method, unfortunatley I work full time so can't sit in front of a screen all day to play it. What time of day is the best to trade this method. I see from your posts that you are reaping a lot of pips. Do you have any idea on what your win:loss ratio is? thanks Rob

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Im recovering my huge loss when i started trading 1 year ago. Im learning all the way, make stupid mistakes, dont follow my plan and get burned. Its a lovely method that works really good when you start seeying it. Dont know abouut your last question, still not enough for me to start normal life, i must recover the loss i had during my early trading days... The last short GJ i posted hit T2 and went more down for a total of ~120pips and stopped right on s1 pivot, the moove followed YM's moove it broke fridays low and slipped down and took GJ for a ride including UJ. edit: T3 hit @ 204.81 that gives us a 150pip moove...not bad

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hi Belekas, I am learning this method also because it could help to manage my trades. Soon i will post also my screenshoots. Best, Tom

--- 帖子 #644 ---
This is the best method out there that ive tried. Its simple, no fancy indicators, no thousands of lines, clean naked chart and your fib on it, nothing more. Just takes alot of practise and screentime on vhands or forextester Anybody else wants to post?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi guys - I'm just passing by and thought I'd post this great set up for the US session - I see that Belekas has already scooped a load of pips off the earlier sell - nice! Here the retrace to the 50% line was a clear sell - good for over 160 pips so far and that's before it reaches its first target at 204.23 - thats 235 pips from the 50% level! Hope you guys got / get plenty of this move.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Thank you Issy, we miss your charts and posts down here, hope you make it up one day The big fib was a nice one, i deleted it somehow and used the smaller range one that worked out as well. Hope your making good pips bro!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I was asking about your win:loss ratio with this Ifib method, rather than your trading in general. Thanks Rob

--- 帖子 #648 ---
you had you questions asnwered if u still seek answers read again, alright? the rest of the post is for the buddies that follow this thread and this method and also my friends, so if you dont like it, just leave and go post somewhere else we clear?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Rob, Thanks for your interest in the Islander "I-fib" method. If you are truly interested in this method I would suggest reading Skunny's thread (the link is listed on page one of this thread). That is where Islander basically created his hybrid method in the shorter time frames. I do not know my win:loss ratio using the Skunny/I-fibs method but I have not had a losing week since I started using Issy's method when he first started posting it on Skunny's thread, which is probably about two months now. That is not to say I have not had losing trades but by entering a position at the 50, DZ, or AL as opposed to waiting to enter on the breakout 100/0 lines your draw down is less if you do take a stop loss and, your profit potential from these areas to the T1 or T2 area are great R:R numbers. I must say that part of my success has also been due to the teachings of fti in his Technical Analysis Fallacy thread. By using proper money management and successful rescue operations I feel like I now have a very powerful arsenal at my disposal if a trade goes the other way on me. It is critical to not get too piggish on my initial entry so that it then becomes difficult to rescue if need be. You should open a demo acct and trade it exclusively using Issy's method and see what your own win:loss ratio would be to satisfy yourself.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
I think you need to re-read my question. I didn't say anything about not liking the method. All I'm looking for is an idea of the win ratio of the method. Simple really - why are you so defensive about it? What was it I said that annoyed you so much?!

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Thanks for taking the time to reply piphitman - that's all I was looking for, a rough idea!

--- 帖子 #652 ---
5M trade on GJ: Enter position at DZ........UJ was going up, UJ hit M3.... at the same time GJ was hitting daily pivot, exited trade w/ 55pips before encountering any resistance. Will wait for next set up.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
It may be a while but.......waiting for GJ to get into the DZ and do it's thing.........thinking we may have a LONG trade on this pair this morning, time to take some patience pills and wait....... Toggling back and forth between 15M and 1H on this fib. Looking at 15M for best entry.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
GM everybody. Lovely trading PipHitman Just woke up and getting ready. Does the pivots indicator you use has the option to set GMT+2 timezone and turn Sunday's data Off?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Here's the pivot indicator I use, I got it from Issy. It uses end of NY trading in determining pivots, My Broker is GMT (ODL Securities) settings: midpivots = true Fhr = false daily = true weekly = false monthly = false Period1 = 1440

--- 帖子 #656 ---
looks like a bounce off the 50 and a slight retrace, wait 15 min or so till London and see what the Brits wanna do with it.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Yes, he sent me this days ago, i have GMT+2 on my NF broker, and its no good, because here you cant change the timezone nor ignore Sundays data i think. What DP you have on GJ and UJ right now? I need someone to code this indicarot and and timezone selector and sunday data functions Posted in mt4 forum, KGB sent me nice one but still same problems...

--- 帖子 #658 ---
GJ = 204.75 UJ = 101.76

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Ok with DSX-tzpivots indicator where i can set timezone +2 i get same pivots like you posted brother but with the indicator your using i get them wrong, like GJ 204.94 and UJ 101.93, thats the point im talking about...The indicator that im using is not so nice like yours and dont have midpivots thats the main thing...

--- 帖子 #660 ---
I've tried a million different pivot indi's too.....I really like the one Issy posted. Before I got that one from Issy I was just going to tradethenews.com and manually set mine up that way.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Yes, looks like a bounce, YM is ready to bounce of the 50% and will take UJ and GJ with it when and if it bounces...Lets wait to see. PPH what you think?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I think I'm going to wait for a LONG to develop, Nikkei was up today, lets see what happens in London........

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Still thinking about long PPH?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
some strong resistance off the 50????

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Yes, maybe a short was better of the 50%? Seems its stuck between lower DZ and 50% edit: short would be good for 32 pips from the 50%, then it broke resistance 205.15 ant is going up. Lets wait and see what happens

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Posting screenshot for Islander, others dont take notice pls.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
m5 gj chart, was away so i missed this nice short entry of the 50% double top rejection, nice trade, T1 hit for about 100 points and price continues its way dooown...

--- 帖子 #668 ---
again I missed it B, Had a feeling it was going to go up and boy did it, I was able to get some pips on the retrace this morning but nothing like what was available just prior to NY open.....oh well.....theres more pips to be taken today too. I just can't seem to stay awake long enough to get in those late London/early NY trades. I live in PST so I think I'm going to have to modify my trading times. Although I like trading the Frankfurt/London it's easier to drag my self out of bed early in the AM than it is to try stay awake late at night without falling asleep in front of the computer.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
happens mate, i missed alot as well in all my life LOL we must stay focused no matter what hows ure trading today? today market undecided, got a few pips on cable and euro, though missed ej and gj bounce from 50% m5 fib. watching closely for possible entries cheers

--- 帖子 #670 ---
This market is crazy...........UJ hovering right at 100? I think I posted a few days ago an analyst from RBS who said the dollar would go to 100, at that time it was around 102 and I thought the guy was crazy??? he said intervention wouldn't take place till around 97 or something in that area, we'll see.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Looking for a place of resistance for my fib. Found three points of both suppport and resistance at 203.90. A 90 pip range which is Ok for a 5M range........ so I placed my fib there and took a really small position after the 50 fib in case of a reversal because this market is in freak show mode.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
GM everybody. Pretty nice mooves yesterday so lets focus today on making some pips. Missed the first long on the bounce from DZ @ 203.60 was good for 40 pips or so. UJ hovering near dayly s1 @ 100.45 and were close to 100 level- strong psichological support, if we break it we see it taking down GJ as well. Dm2 pivot is 100is as well, so thats a strong barrier for bears to cross if we want to see the slide down. Cable broke 50% of the biggest moove that was @ 2.0249 and also DP @ 2.0203, now its going for Dayly r1 @ 2.0351, so lets wait to see what London brings Cheers

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Cable bounced of Dayly r1 @ 2.0351 and pulles GJ down, UJ formed a tripple bottom on m5 and its comming back for the 4th time to try and break it. Will 100 and Dm2 pivot hold? Only time will tell, what you guys see right now? Cheers

--- 帖子 #674 ---
"someone" will push UJ below 100, it's barely hanging on for dear life at 100........how far will it go????

--- 帖子 #675 ---
hi, how to set the fibo with the level price? is the fibo always draged from the previous high to previuos low? and never the low to high? tqs

Ok...That big fall on GJ i was talking about did happen, hope yall caught those pipp'ies Now let the rate cut tommorow go thru and the dust to settle, and hope we have a direction in some time. Miss your posts and charts Issy... Hope to see you sometime back. Cheers!

Good evening folks, im posting cables m15 chart, was too late for a sell of the big fibs 50% level, so entered on the little 110pip range fibd 50% short and rode it down to t1 for a nice 100pips profit. Pips in the bank - aint beying greedy

--- 帖子 #679 ---
GM, Ive missed an early buy at 05:45(NF broker GMT) of the bounce from the 50% zone and now geppy is breaking the wedge to the upside. Auslanco seems to see this right, but lets wait to see what will happen in FO/LO. UJ needs to break and stay above DP 97.38 Cable still undecided. edit: also a nice buy of the DZ on EuroYen, posting chart as well.

Look at this beauty, if we missed the early buy of the 50% zone we could have gotten in on the top DZ zone @ 194.46 something, i walked my fib higher as new highs comes into play. Lovely entry this really was, im waiting for LO to see what the Brits will bring us. Cheers

GM "B"....I finally made a "long" trade in this crazy market, still had to enter on a small mini position (.1 lots) but hey......a trade is a trade. Some nice bounces for a long trade after two weeks of downhill trades.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Nice trading Pph, this early long was a beauty! Congratulations on this one mate Now lets wait for currencies to get back to our DZ's and from there we will see what will happen next.

A slooooooow pace in the Asian session but.....89 pips after an entry from the AL. Let's see what Frankie/London brings.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hi guys - just passing by and thought I'd post this chart - I added the 200ema as its the most watched of the MAs and has held the last 2 pull backs. As long as the last one at 198.30 holds, I'll stay long - but remember the BOE / MPC minutes are due out in a couple of hours at 09:30GMT.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Today i traded GU instead of GJ because i missed the early short that came big and just waited for another nice entry. It was ups and downs. Then a not long ago this perfect setup popped right after it went down, i couldnt believe still such strong moovement by this hour and i missed it. Hope you guys caught it if not then tommorow ps. sellimit from the 50% zone of white fib @ 197.63 would have netted you more then 150points( as i type) and as it broke the lower tl theres no limit for it dayly s1 @ 195.89 Cheers!

got home too late to get in on the 50 fib................already locked in a 20 pip profit, price hitting some resistance so Ill watch closely.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
wild ride in Tokyo.....looks like some profit taking from earlier NY rally off of U.S. Home sales data. Kept waiting for the uptrend to continue but the 5M chart just wasn't showing any long trades........not yet at least. ** Edit: wanted to show how I pulled my fib from the 15M then zoomed out to the 5M to trade **

--- 帖子 #690 ---
skype me up bud here is a chart for ya with no fibs at all! !!!! lol just for fun

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi PipHitMan, I had thought that I was getting used to your style, but your trade yesterday has me wondering. 1. Why did you trade at this time - it is well before the FO? 2. Why did you enter off the 2nd hit of the DZ ? It must have been quite a lot of activity for you to draw the 15 min Fib, switch to the 5 min and decide to enter. 3.What made you decide to exit at the 0% line? If I had taken the trade (but it was far too early for me) it would have been a loser. I would probably have entered on the next 15 min candle when it re-penetrated the AL., set my target as the -38% (which on my chart it failed to reach by 8 pips + spread) and my SL just above the opposite AL. I too have been reading Skunny's, Bo's and FTI's threads as well as this one. Please enlighten me, Iwould love to be able to trade even half as well as you appear to. Thanks, Ian

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Ianfoster, I usually don't get in front of my computer until around 9-10 pm PST which sets me up to trade the Frankie/London open. I was able to get on the computer shortly after dinner time and saw that there was some volatile price action in the Asian session. Taking into considering that we just came off of the day after Easter where the market was not expected to get much action due the Easter Monday there was an unexpected surge in NY session due to the U.S. Home sales data. After Tokyo opened the ride up continued to an obvious high of 200.97. I then began to wait for a low point to draw a fib from. When I do my set-ups prior to trading here is what I have on my dual screens. I usually keep on my screens about 9 charts open at all time. on my right hand screen I keep the following 6 open charts 5M USD/JPY with fibs and pivots &amp; 15M USD/JPY with fibs and pivots 5M GBP/USD with fibs and pivots &amp; 15M GBP/USD with fibs and pivots 5M EUR/USD without fibs and pivots because, well............ its the EURO 5M EUR/JPY with fibs and pivots, I will jump into that pair a lot too. on my left hand screen I keep my 5M, 15M, and 1H GBP/JPY charts with fibs and pivots. By the time I got in front of my screens here is what I saw. Amidst all those red candles I saw that 15M blue candle (3:00am) that reached a high of 200.07. If you placed your 15M fib on the bottom of the red 2:45 am candle the next candle gives you no meaningful retrace to feel confident in trading with. So we wait and then we get another big drop down to 199.43. So I then place the low of my fib range there and watch as the next blue candle that I pointed out on my 15M chart "tried" but failed to reach a higher high than the 3:00 am candle, but it stopped right at the DZ on my new fib range. That is the reason why I posted the 5M and the 15M chart on that trade because as soon as I placed my 15M fib that blue candle was sitting right on the DZ and on the 5M it was easy to place a short trade with a tight stop above the DZ (I probably would have stopped myself out manually if price went above the 50 line....that was only 18 pips away). The reason why I exited the trade when I did was because we had just seen such a strong downward move in the Asian session I was concerned that it was running out of gas and might not continue its downward march. It was pretty much a scalp trade for some quick pips. Sometimes if I enter off the 50, DZ, or AL line I will put my TP area right around the 0/100 line so if it is a fake breakout I will not get burned with no pips at all. The key for me in using Issy's fib style is to always, always, always, get in before the 0/100 line. Hope that explains it........

--- 帖子 #693 ---
just got onto computer, I missed the red fib trade (there were two nice support and resistance lines to work from), so I just walked up my fibs and took the yellow one from just below the AL to T1. There were two nice bounces off of the 50 and then a nice reversal pin bar on the last one.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi PipHitman, Thanks for the detailed explaination. I agree with you on the importance of getting in before the 0/100 line. Otherwise the R:R is not very good. The problem is to know when the odds of hitting the target are high enough for a 'premature entry' - that is where I need some more experience. Thanks again, Ian

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Piphitman, can u pls post ur fib indicator i see on ur chart?am a newbie.Thanks

--- 帖子 #696 ---
its just a regular fib with different letters placed in the normal spots DZ =62 and 38 area AL = 76 and 23 areas

--- 帖子 #697 ---
anybody following tonight? I'm a newbie, but i've got a big pinbar on the usjp 15 min.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
heres one I got in on the DZ (blue oval) 199.67 took it all the way down to the 0 line and didn't take any profit, waited for it to penetrate and keep running but it didn't (not yet). Exited and settled for only a few pips as it made its way back up toward the DZ. *** Important to be watching all three pairs as UJ was taking off upwards like a rocket which spoiled the party, and gave me my signal to get out*** still waiting for another Opportunity to enter but I may have to wait till it finally breaks through and enter with a very, very tight stop loss.

PPH? I am a newb and I dont know how to post charts yet, but I have actually worked thru skunnys thread first and now through issy's. If you're bored and watching this, go throw an Ifib on the AUD/USD monthly and weekly then look at the 1 hour to see whats lining up. That is, put on the Ifib of last week's range and last month's range, then look at prices now.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
updated chart of both the 5M and 15M chart of my previous unsuccessful GJ 5M trade. yet another reason to keep several TF charts of same pair on your screen. I never got back into that short GJ trade, I was too tired and went to bed. I woke up after NY session was well on it's way and saw how the 5M chart contained inside the larger TF 15M chart showed a great opportunity to go short on the 15M 50 fib. There were 4 price rejections at 200.46 before price finally went down to hit T1 on the 15M . Even a trade entered at the AL on the 15M was worth 150 pips. have a nice weekend everybody.........

--- 帖子 #702 ---
15M short news candle, not trading just observing on the GBP PMI news. T1 hits to the pip.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
It amazes me just how often it does that (hit to the pip).

--- 帖子 #704 ---
5M GJ, waited for Tokyo Open, price had already touched entry line, then penetrated (blue rectangle), waited for entry on the retrace, took a position at the DZ, had to suffer some draw down but price failed to reach lower lows so I stayed with it.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi Pip - nice trade and a super clear chart! I've added a 34 ema and a 200ema to act as filters on my 5m charts. Here you could add an additional entry as price again tested the rising 200ema and also bounced at the lower AL I usually trade in units of 3 and as the upper AL wasnt broken, once price re-entered the DZ I'm looking for it to give me another buy signal - this time it was the 200 ema.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
good one Issy, I'm gonna try slapping those filters on my charts as well.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
After walking the fib to the latest high, price pulled back into the DZ for more Buys......BUT it then failed to get back to its 204.74 high, so I'd close before taking a loss. After an unusually quiet Franky Hour, price bot back into the DZ and once again found support at the still rising 200ema - a great confluence of signals to try another buy. Whilst we show T1 at 205.08, I prefer NOT to be greedy as the pivot R1 level and the 205 level are resistance and would take partial profits here. Its NFP today and we can expect a quiet session till that comes out.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
after that peek above R1 I've went ahead and walked up my 5M to a pretty tight 74 pip range.......just gonna sit and watch it from here and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
playing the NFP. I had one very small short position in at 204.70 just waiting for NFP to hit. I had a stop loss at 205.06. So my worse case scenario was a $36 loss and I figured that we were going to the short side after the release of these numbers anyway. My SL was hit in the furious action leading up to actual NFP report. I missed being in the safety zone by 6 pips. That's OK, I was able to jump into the waterfall with a larger position @ 203.99 and got out at 203.66 with 33 pips so I was positive on the short. We just had a wicked 170 pip down move in ten minutes so I waited and drew a new fib knowing we would have at least a 50% retrace. We had a retrace of about 70% before we headed back down again. I placed a new fib on the retrace and traded it from there on my Ikon/Royal demo acct with ridiculously high 8 standard lots for some really good pips. This was my the first time ever I was actually awake during the NY session to experience the NFP action and to say the least it was very exciting once we came close to the NFP report issuance. Not so sure I would want to trade this infamous news item every month but I had to stay up and see it "LIVE" for myself at least once. Have a great weekend everybody............

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Price is still inside the DZ of this fib drawn from the Feb 26 high to the March 17 low. This is the fourth hit of magenta falling Trend Line. Price is currently held just above the 200ema and under the TL - lets see what FO and LO bring....

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Fridays sell off held just above the DZ on this chart and the bounce in the Asian Session has held - so far - under the long term trend line

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Now we can see the action since yesterdays open - a small pull back to close the opening gap and then a 190 pip rally up to 204.22, above the upper DZ. Then a pull back that was held at the 50% line - 203.63. So will it break up above 204.22 or fall under the 203.60 area support - the action after the Frankfurt Open at 06:00 (GMT) or the London Open an hour later will give us the answer.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
nice charts Issy, I have my 15M setup the same as yours, I was also eyeballing a little different 4H chart for the retrace down to the DZ with an added upward trend line to watch as well. Also monitoring a 1M channel as well. will have to wait and see what side of that zone (204.20 / 203.66) price will break to.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
So far little action from the Brits after LO - back into the DZ on this narrower fib. UJ has not been able to break out upwards and given the expected rate cut in cable expected this week, I doubt that we'll see much of a rally there. I'm still waiting for the 204.22 to 203.60 range to break - guess we'll have to take some patience pills.....

--- 帖子 #715 ---
EJ 5M Set up a couple of trendlines and watched 5M EJ bounce around like a pinball. Finally took a long at the AL, exited early after price stalled then started coming back down. Don't want to get too greedy.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Well I'm bored sitting around watching GJ do nothing............Only pair with some decent action seems to be EUR/USD. Went and took a look, saw there was a nice clean set up for a long trade.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Yesterdays weak rally failed in the lower DZ, holding at the falling gann line. Now it needs to break under yesterdays low of 1.9830 if it is to continue on down - will the UK House Data due out in an hour provide the trigger?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
On the hourly chart, UJ has pulled back into its DZ and remains there. On this chart, It has turned in the lower DZ and is trying to rally, but first has to break its falling gann line. If it does, that will give a buy signal.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Yesterday was an anaemic day - even for the usually quiet Monday. Whilst price was held by the falling gann line, it is currently still just inside its DZ, waiting for a resolution of the GU / UJ battle. We'll have to wait for LO and the UK data to see if these will put some life into the market - otherwise it will be another day for scalping off the lower time frames........ http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon11.gif

--- 帖子 #720 ---
191 pip drop on GJ..........just like last Friday's NFP report........we wait for the action to settle down and then get on the 1M charts for some quick scalps. Set up some trend lines put up a fib, price rejects off the 50% and heads down. Enter on the AL but get out before T1 because we had a DM1 pivot to contend with.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
PipHitMan, Are you monitoring the USDJPY, GBPUSD, before you make your GBPJPY trade, or are you going it alone based on your Fib analysis? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
The lower high at o4:15 GMT under the falling gann line was the first sign to look for a short entry. This was just inside this DZ and under the 204 level, so a sell on the break of the green 200 ema provided a nice entry and the poor UK housing data accelerated the move. Well over 200 pips were available as cable had a big drop - more than 100 pips greater than its average daily range. Hope you guys got some of it http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #723 ---
As PipH is sleeping now, I'll comment. I watch USDJPY and GBPUSD whilst primarily trading GBPJPY and I'll have the same analysis on all three - apart from fibs, these include the 50 and 100 levels and the daily pivots from the 5pm EST close. Thus I can see which of the 2 major pairs is moving and thus causing GJ to move and I'll be prepared for any news due out in the UK or US. Today, at the London Open, UJ was flat to slightly down and cable was falling - so GJ was following cable down. The poor UK housing data accelerated GJs fall and the UJ started to fall as well. With UJ and cable both falling GJ fell hard and fast and by watchin how UJ and cable were falling and when UJ stopped - much earlier than cable - it helped to decide how to trade GJ. I hope that helps.....

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Thanks Islander. It's really something how you've "tamed" the supposedly super- "noisy" 5m charts. I've been doing well with Bobokus' thread and I've been nicely suprised by the results following your thread while utilizing the lower timeframes. Thanks again for the info.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Islander, Your thread has been very enlightening to me, thank you. Still working my way through Skunny's and Bobokus's threads... Regarding what you say above... I have chosen to focus on EJ to the exclusion of all others... Getting, what others on various parts of this forum speak of as, a 'feel' for a single pair... Am I wasting valued learning time by not watching related pairs - as you talked about above?... Or is it best to just focus on one pair initially? Regards, Magnus

--- 帖子 #726 ---
You're welcome - Bobokus is The Master here and I've only "borrowed" some ideas and adapted them to my current style of trading.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Hi Magnus - I dont trade EJ, and as we know, the EURUSD is a slower moving pair than cable, so I'd keep an eye on USDJPY as that will normally be the faster mover in this cross. If you are fairly new to trading Forex I'd stick with just watching EJ and just take a note of the US news so that you can exit or reduce size in front of the "big" numbers - I'm talking of my day-trading style here, rather than a long term position. Watching all 3 can be confusing, so get some experience before deciding to try it - its not for everyone! Good luck Issy

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Thank you Issy... I get the impression that it really doesn't matter too much what you trade initially... I'll stick to EJ just now... If there is not much progress, beyond that which I have made so far, I'll take a step back and re-approach. Magnus

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Rialto, I think Islander pretty much answered your question. below is a list of my chart set up that I posted a few pages back. When I do my set-ups prior to trading here is what I have on my dual screens. I usually keep on my screens about 9 charts open at all time. on my right hand screen I keep the following 6 open charts 5M USD/JPY with fibs and pivots &amp; 15M USD/JPY with fibs and pivots 5M GBP/USD with fibs and pivots &amp; 15M GBP/USD with fibs and pivots 5M EUR/USD without fibs and pivots because, well............ its the EURO 5M EUR/JPY with fibs and pivots, I will jump into that pair a lot too. I would never trade the GBP/JPY alone without seeing the other two majors that feed it.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Thanks for the response, PHM. Good Luck tonight.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Updated chart, see the clean bounce off the 50% line 5 candles ago. Price held there for an hour. Now its held at the Daily Pivot and falling gann line.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Here I've used the clearer low for the fibs high to give a slightly narrower range. The small failed move to new lows will be significant IF price has another failure around the 201 level. I'm not posting a cable chart as it has been flat ib a very tight range for more than 12 hours

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Good Morning Issy...... I just woke and saw, UJ was rejecting off of it's pivot, and 5M GJ showing a break of trendlines at around the 50 fib area. Placed a "short" entry on this one. I may or may not be entering this too early (cable seems to be waking up) but if it turns around on me I don't have a big drawdown if I have to exit. *** waited for London open, price started heading the other way, took a 10 pip gain before price moving the other way ***

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Now to the action.....the high so far is at the Frankfurt Open, on the touch of the lower DZ 15 mins ago. Will this and the falling gann line hold? - time will tell - also, remember the UK data that's due in two hours.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
This is another way of using the fibs for scalping off the 5m or even the 1m charts - just run a fixed fib off the 100 levels and the 50 levels Try it out and see if it works for you!

--- 帖子 #736 ---
This is the same fixed fibs chart updated. When price made a higher low by bouncing off the 201.50 level for the last time, this was a nice buy signal, followed by a 100+ pip run up to the next 50 level. Placing the fixed 100 pip fib on the 50 levels showed a continuation bounce out of its DZ which then failed and made a lower high. Time to return to the short side......

--- 帖子 #737 ---
where can i get same indicator as yours... tq

--- 帖子 #738 ---
From now on I'll be concentrating on the 1m time frame, with less comments. The annotations on the charts will high-light the possible entries. For clarity, only the last fib will be shown.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
There are no indicators as such on the chart, except the sweet spots which just saves me drawing the 50 and 100 levels manually - I've attached it. Edit: Sorry, I forgot the pivot levels - did you mean those?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Clear moves between the pivot levels and the DZ. IF cable turns south and joins UJ - watch out below!

--- 帖子 #741 ---
UJ bounced a little and GU came off - result GJ sideways. IMO unlikely there will be much action untill the Asian session. Next update will be before the Frankfurt Open

--- 帖子 #742 ---
More sell signals from the DZ early in the Asian Session for the drop first to the 200.00 level and finally to the pivot M1 line before a bounce back into the new DZ to reload the shorts. Up to 150 pips from the first shorts and then another 80 from the second. Now the 199.50 level is holding as we wait for Frankies Hour.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Update - another pull back into the new DZ and this time cable joined UJ in falling and took GJ down hard to the 199 level at FO, for another 80 pip drop. Now lets see what happens in the latest DZ

--- 帖子 #744 ---
After the strong drop into FO GJ is retracing and now held between the pivot S2 and M1 levels. UJ is likewise in between its S1 and S2 levels and cable has been down to and has now bounced up off its DP at 1.9724. Patience is now required and with the Cable and Euro rates announcements later this morning it may be better to wait until after the announcements before entering again.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
I agree Issy, today is a day for making some pips with no less than 5 high profile news reports coming out.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Agreed and sometimes its best just to watch the S / R levels. Here, the last bounce up was off the 50 level and the rising gann line. It got just above its S1 level when UJ also made a second hit on its S1 level and turned south again. A clear sell and now to see how far it drops - but best to take some profits at the Support levels before the UK news due in 10 mins at 08:30 GMT

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Always monitor the higher TFs - here the 5m and the 50% retrace that GJ likes so much - right on the S1 line too!

--- 帖子 #748 ---
The last Sell ran down inside the gann line and finally bounced off the M0 pivot level. UJ looks set to fall to its next pivot level at 100.30, but cable is rallying, so GJ will probably go sideways

--- 帖子 #749 ---
As I suggested earlier, price went sideways between to M0 and S1 levels until after the UK rates announcement. The widely anticipated 0.25% cut helped UJ to sell off and GJ followed to a new low one pip above its S3 level. How far will it bounce? - the 50% which is where the M0 level was acting as support will now be an important resistance.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
The move off the days low has been stronger than I expected and has retraced just over 50% of todays range, finally halting at the M1 level. Remembering that Bernanke is speaking later, we may range trade until then.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Whoops - no range trading, but rather a strong dollar rally, helped by a positive start on Wall Street. Here's the last chart that I'll post for now - too much else to do.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Early Asian session the past few days has shown some good trades so I decided to stay late at work and check it out today.......I was not disappointed. Price went upward from Asian open with consecutive higher lows and once it penetrated the M4 line it came back down to test and settled nicely for a few bounces off of the DZ/M4 line and a clean entry point before heading to its target. Winner, Winner burnt chicken dinner....... See ya'll in London.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Couldn't break above the DP in Frankies Hour and failed after the LO - good for 30+ pips down to the MS1 pivot.....

--- 帖子 #754 ---
After yesterdays big run up in the US session we can expect a duller day - well until the dollar sold off in the 10:30 candle..... Edit:GE Says Profit Fell, Citing Finance; Forecast Reduced so that explains it.....WalMart's news sent it up yesterday, GE's sends it back down today......great for volatility and trading....

--- 帖子 #755 ---
This was the trigger for GJs fall....

--- 帖子 #756 ---
well done Issy, I think it's called the piphitman indicator. I sit in front of my computer and price does nothing, I go to bed and price drops like a rock. have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #757 ---
What Ho !!, Where is everyone? Having to trade during early mid Asian session due to job. Noticing that no one else here trades in this session. Asian Very whippy during this session last several days. Last week was good. This week a looser. Was trying to trade EJ and moved to GJ to follow this thread more accurately. But spread and incomplete movements... price breaking DZ but not hitting targets and then reversing between DZ and 0 or 100 fib is eroding my confidence. Is it me, the session or recent price action?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
a bit of a choppy market so far this morning. We saw Cable punch through to the down side of 1.9700 finally and UJ making lower highs so I entered a short trade on GJ from the AL but took profit and exited immediately at the 200EMA as the 200EMA was an expected bounce point.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Lou, If you can get onto the very first moves in the Asian session you can make some good pips here lately. You gotta be on the very opening and watching IMO because after that it can get kinda slow at times in Asian session. If I can enter a position at the DZ and price goes my way to the 100/0 line and then does an about face and reverses I'm going to take "some" profit there and see what the rest of the position does for me. If all you did was trade the DZ to the 100/0 you could still make some good profits.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
a GJ Whopper, anywhere from 140 to 200 pips depending on entry. fib drawn from low of yesterday to the high of the Asian session just prior to Frankfurt opening. Price had one pierce below the DZ and that was it. It was all UP from there. I was not in this trade I was over baggin pips on Cable.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Thanks for the heads up on the early Asian. I have been starting a bit later than the opening.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Cable took a strong run up yesterday and then stopped in a narrow range and stayed there for almost 12hrs. Price on Cable didn't seem to be able to get any sort of significant retrace below the 24% fib level so it was apparent that when Cable did move this morning that it was going to the upside again and I was waiting for it on GJ. Took an entry at the AL and played it only up to the breakout "0" line because Cable was having to do all the heavy lifting as UJ was in a downtrend and was not helping out at all. P.S. Lou.....that was 60 pips from only entering and exiting between the inner fib points.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Cable trending downward this morning...but UJ was heading up so we had some consolodation till right before Frankfurt open then UJ hit a wall at 104.05 and brought down GJ rather quickly.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
\ WHAT ABOUT GJ??

--- 帖子 #765 ---
The pull back from Fridays wide range day allowed me to pull this fib which cinfirmed a Sell as price stalled round the 208 level in the Asian Session. 200+ pips from this move so far........ http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Some retrace - even the T3 level got hit - over a 380 pip fall.....

I wake up in the middle of Frankie open and look at the charts and see that GJ appears as if it's in a freefall......GJ has been fueled by some big moves by UJ as well as Cable. 5M GJ has 6 very long bearish candles. Too late for me to enter anyway so I'll just watch for another entry to go short. We just had a 76 pip GJ downstroke so we'll wait for a little retracement after the penetration of 203.41. Price retraces up and out of the DZ area and I'm still thinking short "but" the thing to observe is that UJ has now moved into a very tight zone around 103 and is making higher highs and higher lows and Cable is also heading upwards. So now I'm even more cautious and I wait some more and see GJ move out of the other side of the DZ to signal a long entry but I'm still not convinced so I wait till the AL break before entering, I'm still not 100% convinced of a LONG move on GJ but I entered a small position anyways and got out at the 50 line (because GJ likes the 0 and 50 lines) with 33 pips. In hindsight I should have entered off the three bounces off the DZ @ 204.00 and could have bagged 50 pips but I was very wary of the choppy whipsaw action this morning and my GJ hourly chart is still looking like more of a short bias than long.

Clever analysis PHM. Resourceful as usual. Good day.

from Tokyo to Frankie...........stuck in the DZ.........somethings gotta give

--- 帖子 #770 ---
while waiting for GJ to get it's act together, took a nice entry on a Cable short at Frankie time AL to T1.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Nice one Pip - I took the same trade in cable - exited at the 800 level! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif Edit; now to see if this is a "Frankie Fakeout".....TWT

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Working at some possible moves on a 4 hour chart - all of the trend lines are Gann Lines. The last timeline on April 18 was 1 candle out in over 230 - will the next one be as close? - TWT The orange red gann line is from the November 1st high at 241 and will need to come back into play IF this suggested scenario is to work out.

Back to actual trading off the shorter time frames, from yesterdays action after the Frankfurt Open..... Here's a good example of the KISS approach. A good reminder of simple price action with double tops and bottoms in this sideways market - just take the short moves whilst the market contines to consolidate before its next big move Edit: Now at todays Frankfurt Open and price still around the 205 level, I dont need any fibos to tell me that its hanging around the 50% retrace and deciding which way to go. Plenty of data due out today to help it......

--- 帖子 #774 ---
just as a visual, here's what I'm looking at on my 4H GJ chart right now, what I noticed most was the two rejections off the 50 fib on my tighter range fib.....

--- 帖子 #775 ---
No clear signal on GJ yet but Cable had a nice entry for a few pips at Frankie open. Would have liked to get in earlier but pips is pips.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Nice on pip. I am watching you guys and will post as i catch some moves. You did well to get some out of all this mess this morning, pound is really wild today. Geppy seems to be fib trapped at the moment with no clear direction and i am waiting for this to breakout, let price show us the hand first. Up, down, up, down, hmm, think i will stay out for now! Hey pip, on that cable trade this morning, where would you have placed your stop, around the pivot area? Steve

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Steve, please do post your trades, it's nice to see different sets of eyes on the I-fib method...... Yes, I probably would have placed my SL it right above the pivot, I took that trade too late for my liking, (too close to the breakout area) but I saw some good momentum all of a sudden and just jumped into the waterfall......I did the same quick trade yesterday on Cable right around Frankie open when it fell pretty quickly. Cable &amp; GJ were all over the place today leading up to the GBP retail sales report so I just stayed out after that initial little burst trade around Frankie, doesn't look like much is going to happen again till the U.S. data comes out. I'll be in bed anyways so good luck trading.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
As GBPJPY is the cross of GBPUSD and USDJPY, it pays to watch the action on both of the majors - here UJ. Whilst fibos are a useful tool, sometimes its clearer just to watch the action around the daily pivot lines as shown on this chart and earlier today there was plenty! The only fibo I used was just to confirm what is obvious by looking at the chart - that after the 10am EST data, price pulled back around half of the previous news inspired rally and then became a buy....

--- 帖子 #779 ---
saw a nice little doji and pinbar reversal set up form on Cable (blue ellipse) 1/2 way into Frankie so I entered a sell trade at the AL.................looking good so far.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
winner winner burnt chicken dinner.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
My Cable Hourly chart was still showing a short bias so I let the trade run a little, hit T1 and then moved my stop up to the "0" line. Hit T2 and moved my stop to the T2 line, stopped out on the next retrace candle for a nice 31 pip profit. UK GDP due out today so must be patient now and wait for more action.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
That's the way to go Pip - it looks like it will test yesterdays low at 1.9684. As I said in my post yesterday, when GJ is in a sideways consolidation, its often best to concentrate on one of the majors and you're having success with cable - great trading http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Thanks Issy, The U.S. Peso seems to be getting stronger here lately which is not good for GJ right now. Cable/Peso going down, Peso/Yen going up???? you are right, when GJ ranges, time to trade one of it's Majors, I have only traded Cable the last three mornings....

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Too busy watching Cable................How'd I miss this one GRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
beautiful set up of UJ and GJ step for step this morning. UJ respecting the daily pivot "twice" then walking up the fib levels very orderly to T1. GJ was ascending nicely up on it's own 50 and 100 levels after being rejected twice off of the support DZ level which was also the 205.50 level.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
GJ's rally was on the back of this set up in UJ - another clear use of the pivots with confirmation from the upper DZ hit and support from a gann line. Timewise, the buy signal was 40 mins before Frankies Hour, so I guess some European traders made an early start - well it is POETS Day!

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Cable actually made a new low 15 mins after the London Open and this pulled GJ down into the top of its DZ and onto support from a gann line. 100+ pips were available from that Buy Signal...... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #788 ---
wah...tought could see some naked women here...

As we can never be certain how far a move will go, I trade in multiple lots and exit some of my position as price hits target areas - here the stall at the R1 level of 206.60, and then put in a stop on the remainder to lock in some profit. Cable's reversal has been fast and furious, so after the pause at R1, GJ carried on up to its R2 level at 207.37 - also the fibo T2 level - its great when you get synchronicity like this! Take some more profit and move up the stop on the remainder - now its a super Poets Day, so I'm finished for this week http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif

--- 帖子 #791 ---
The last chart of the week - the rally overshot T2 and R2 by 30 or so pips before pulling back and bouncing just above the DZ - a continuation that then FAILED to make a new high. A clear signal for a fall - that pull back turned out to be a 100 pip drop before the next bounce. So just watch the action around the S &amp; R levels and dont get fixated on expecting GJ to necessarily make its turing point at a specific level or target - with practice you'll learn to read the signals and pirate a ship full off pips!

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Over the weekend I review my longer term charts and have posted the weekly GJ chart to focus on last weeks candle - a bearish long legged doji, with almost no upper wick. Hussin Naiji's statistics reveal that there have only been five of these patterns during the past 14 years, with last week's being the sixth. The results were: 1-Apr 1994 ,then after three weeks with -900 p 2-Nov 1994 , then after four weeks with -2000 p 3-Nov 2000 , then after one week with -1400 p 4-Feb 2002 ,then after two weeks with -1000 p 5-Jun 2007 , then after three weeks with -2500 p with the actual reversals: 1-Apr 1994 first +170 p then downtrend 2-Nov 1994 first +130 p then downtrend 3-Nov 2000 at once downtrend 4-Feb 2002 first +200 p then downtrend 5-Jun 2007 first +220 p then downtrend Remember that the FOMC meeting is on Wednesday and on Friday the NFP data comes out. Also, there are several other "Red" news releases this week, so this is potentially a volatile 5 days! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon11.gif

--- 帖子 #793 ---
I rarely post daily or 4 hour charts as the individual candles vary greatly from broker to broker - however, this shows GJ's current overall move. IF the 209 high holds, price could still fall to catch up with the last magenta gann line.......

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Here as we wait for the Europeans and Londoners to start trading is my 15 min chart. UJ has held in the Sunday / Asian session with a double top at Fridays high - 104.80 area and cable is also holding under Fridays high of 1.9890. GJ has managed a slightly higher high at 207.85, corresponding to UJ's second hit on its 104.80 area. Now I'll let the Brits finish their morning tea and show us some movement......

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Morning Islander, Great work, very interesting statistics. I'm intrigued to see how this one pans out. Personnally still long from last week although I almost have a short signal, I think there is still some room to move up and until reading your post had initial targets of around 210 and had been thinking (hoping ) that 212 - 216 wasn't out of the question. Just shorted on the break of a T/l on a separate acc.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Well the brits obliged with a push down out of this narrow range fib - good for 30 or 40 pips so far......but keep a close watch that this is not one of their famous "Big Ben" fake-outs.....

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Issy, Thanks for the Long term analysis info. On my weekly chart I see that the last moves downward have held resistance and continued downward. The latest current move is still forming, looks like we'll have to see around a 400 pip drop in the coming weeks for price to continue respecting it's resistance levels.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Good morning Pip - from the statistics that I posted above, the maximum rise after this weekly doji has been 220 pips - i.e. the 210 area - now that's a very nice round number!! - and well below the strong resistance around 214. For now, I favour the continuation of the uptrend until I can see the hourly chart turning south - I'll post a chart.....

--- 帖子 #799 ---
The rally is clearly running out of momentum - at least, judged by the action so far this week. The 50% fib here at 206.17 is reminding us that this area that was resistance will now be support and an hourly close under it will be the first clear signal that the up trend is rolling over..... With the big news events due this week, we may get a sideways chop until their release, so I'll be happy with some more scalps like the one I've just posted.....

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Good morning Wolf - thanks - I too found thoses statistics quite compelling. Just looking back I see that the 208.14 area has held 4 times on the daily chart as ressistance, so with the support at 206.14, we currently have a 200 pip range to trade in whilst watching for a breakout - I guess that you'll be voting for the upwards break!..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #801 ---
just wanna say hi and thanks alot for the great stuff...

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Thanks Affandiz - just trying to help everyone - me included! - to make some pips....

--- 帖子 #803 ---
I hope that comment helped.......as we can now see, there were 2 bounces off the Daily Pivot level, the last one 25 mins after LO, so instead of following the red down trend, it was a fakeout and price reversed and went up and has now accelerated above the green up trend gann line, passing out of the top of the DZ to hit T2 - and the MR2 / M4 line at 208.55 - a good place to bank some more pips.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Cable made a low right at the London Open after falling over 70 pips in Frankies Hour - a typical fakeout as I suggested yesterday. The Brits then took it up 180 pips into a new high for this move. Now price is holding above its Daily Pivot, waiting for the UK Housing Data at 04:30 EDT, followed by the speach by the BOE Governor King 15 mins later.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
The double top at 02:00 GMT was yesterdays high and UJ slowly sold off all day before a late bounce that is currently holding under todays pivot and the DZ. The Consumer Confidence data is due out at 10am EDT

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Yesterday's action was all about cable's move and after the 100 pip drop into the London Open, the rally went up over 190 pips into the early US session before retracing 80% of the rally. Price is now holding just under the DZ and Daily Pivot and is forming a wedge with the shallow magenta gann line acting as support. I can see another sideways day, with the possibility of some news driven action whilst the markets await tomorrows more important data.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Cable finally broke down below support at 1.9893 and has just broken below the intraday pivot.....currently trying to push down to the next support level sitting at 1.9850 area. needs to get and STAY below 1.9850 to continue........we'll see what London brings........

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Cable broke under its daily pivot in the 6am GMT candle - LO - and that was a clear sell in GJ which held inside the falling red gann line which is set to the average daily range. UJ turned away from its DP at 9:30 and its fall accelerated GJ's drop - which has been greater than I expected - obviously the Brits didnt like the news. I closed my short in the last fall towards the 205 level, some 250 pips since price was rejected at the daily pivot.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
things started warming up a bit right before Frankie open. took a short position below the intraday low once the Frankfurt traders pushed it below the Intraday low level for the third time, rode it down to a smaller take profit area from a smaller fib range. 37 pips.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Yesterday was a classic buy from the London Open that ran up more than 400 pips. The pull back after the FOMC finally spiked down early in the Asian Session to hit the 50% retracement at 205.75 for a Buy - now lets see where the Brits take it - the Europeans are on holiday today, so the main action should be after the LO at 7 am GMT

--- 帖子 #811 ---
The pull back to the 206 level - also the DP - allowed an add on buy. Now with a fib on the pull back we have levels in case the rally fails - the 207 level was a good one at which to take profit on part of the buy. Now we wait to see if the mid pivot at 207.16 can be broken.....

--- 帖子 #812 ---
GJ hit the 207.16 mid point level to the pip and then pulled back right thru the DZ, but failed to break the lower AL level which would have confirmed a reversal sell. Instead it bounced back up BUT failed to break the 207 level and the US data turned price down and confirmed a sell on the failure to continue the rally. I had a limit order to close my short a few pips above the 205.05 mid pivot and so allowing for my spread, I closed partial at 205.20 and will now watch for the action at the open of the US markets and again at the next data - the ISM Manufacturing Index at 10am EDT.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Whilst 204.66 is at the average daily range from todays high, the fall has stalled, so I'll tighten my stop on the remainder of my short and also put a limit order in at 204.75 in case there is a break of the 205 level - cable to its 700 level would probably do the trick.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Well done Issy, I didn't even trade today figuring on a rather slow London/Euro session due to holiday......... but a pip pirate such as yourself always finds a way to extract some pips from the markets, holiday or not.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
GJ pulled back into its DZ and then bounced up off the green gann line for a Buy. It now needs to break the 207.20 area to confirm a continuation on towards the strong resistance just under the 208 level. This is where UJ has its strong resistance at the 104.87 level and cable its Daily Pivot and 9800 level. The Halifax House Price data is due at 3am EDT / London Open and later the all important NFP at 8:30 EDT - probably difficult trading until then, I'll be looking for quick scalps on small trades.... Edit: I exited partials as UJ spiked to 105 and GJ to its R1 level - now for the UK data...

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hey Islander... Is your Gann line off of a charting tool or have you done some calculations in order to make use of it? Lou

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Hi Lou - its the standard MT4 tool, and yes I've tested numerous different angles accross the time frames that I use. Here the same angle caught the high and the "slower" light green has provided support - PM me if you want more info.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
No Japanese trading until Wednesday and the Brits are also on holiday today - Monday. Cable is holding under the well established falling gann line, BUT has now put in 2 higher lows, the last at the 9700 level - can it now break 9800? UJ has bounced up off a rising gann line, but has been halted by the strong resistance in the 105.65 area. We may have to wait until the US session for clarification....

--- 帖子 #819 ---
The above mentioned situation leaves GJ in the upper section of the rising gann line channel. This was after the second bounce from the 50% retracement level of 203.53, that bounce led to the second attempt at the 209 level via the unconvincing green doji on Friday afternoon. With the rest of Europe recovering from the long weekend, we'll probably have to wait until the US session for some action - the ISM Manufacturing data's due at 10am EDT. The trend is still up, BUT the 209 level must be broken for the move to continue to the next resistance around 213.90 - I'll be watching the action on my 15 min charts....

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Not a lot of action yesterday, the ISM data turned UJ south and GJ followed down to the bottom DZ line which held in late US trading and again overnight with a higher low giving a buy that ideally needs confirmation by breaking up out of the DZ. The green gann 1 line has been broken and may act as resistance IF the Brits decide to buy when they return from their long weekend.... UK Services PMI is due out at 4:30am EDT

--- 帖子 #821 ---
G'morning Islander Been away for a while. Difficult trading GY just now, seems better to trade GU and UY individually

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Hi, welcome back. I agree and often just trade the individual pair - GU's been good and the yesterday afternoon UJ had a good fall http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #823 ---
A clean pull back into the DZ and then the Frankies sold UJ hard - will they continue to do so as they did with cable yesterday?....TWT Edit: They did after another perfect DZ pull back....

--- 帖子 #824 ---
I am watching to see if the G/J pulls back to 203.500 area before it starts back down.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Its now in the 203.50 area and my narrower fib DZ, BUT give cable's run up to its 9600 area - its 50% retrace - AND the possibility of UJ retracing to its 104 area, I'm thinking that the wider fib's DZ might come into play - i.e. the 204 area - as ever, Time Will Tell! I'm flat now after a hectic couple of hours and will wait for the BOE announcement

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Yes, I am watching the G/U. My bias is down, but for now I am watching. I only trade the first 4 hours of the London session, so it may start moving at that time.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Islander, I only had a short time to trade so I focused on G/U. I had a 28 pip gain before I had to close my position because of time. Someone is making money with the G/J though. Have a good day trading.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
I rode GU up too and am now short. As I suspected, the wider range GJ fib came into play with GJ getting well up into the DZ and allowing a good sell for well over 50 pips - now I'm flat watching UJ....

--- 帖子 #829 ---
By 00:00 GMT UJ had already given a sell signal from its DZ and cable followed at 01:00 with a hit on its 50% level - although its taken until now - the Fankfurt Open to get any real action....

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Good Morning Issy......yep Frankfurt does not dissapoint. I woke up too late to get into this one so I'll have to wait around for the next one.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hi Pip - as I dont hold overnight, I didnt get it all, but bagged the early European action! Now a bounce back into my 5m DZ for another sell - with a tight stop as cable's held at its 500 level and we all know how the Brits like their fakeouts... Edit: I've taken partial profits on the retest of the 201.50 level, now I'll let the remainder run with locked in profits.......

--- 帖子 #832 ---
I narrowed my range down a bit more and got in a little late but still made 25 quick pips from 201.77 to 201.52

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Nice one Pip. The Swissy's held around its 1.0427 support and that's not letting UJ drop under its 103 level - IF that breaks UJ has major support around 102.67 off its 4 hour chart - that would be around 200.60 in GJ, assuming that cable stays around 1.9540. Just keep trailing the stop and see what the market gives.....

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Another 100 + pip sell from the DZ - what a great Friday..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif NB 200.78 is the 50% retrace off the 4 hour chart

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Three legs down, all with good retraces into the DZ and then a "Sell the Rumour, Buy the News" trade taken with the better than expected Trade Balance that had been clearly signaled by the Swissy's higher low. Here my target was the 50% retrace - it may go further, depending on the Dows action - but I'll not be greedy - I'll be a Poet!

--- 帖子 #836 ---
I would like to trade also like islander fibbing... :blushing: Need to learn more Best wishes, Tom

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hey guys, excuse the intrusion Just wanted to ask a potentially offensive question, albeit in good intent.. Isn't all of this DZ stuff just another way of saying "here's an arbitrary breakout zone"? I.e. isn't all this stuff just artificial range breakout with a bit of fib projections for TP thrown in? Alternatively it's playing retraces, not sure Not that I've done too much research just yet(I do use fibs and FEs and extensions a lot in my own trading though), just going by what I see so far..

--- 帖子 #838 ---
SL, no worries on the question, it's all good. if you use fibs, then the high and low points have to be placed somewhere, right? so are you placing your fibs on an "artificial" range too? If you use fibs then you know very well the importance of watching what price does when it enters and either continues through or is rejected at the 38 and 62 fib levels (DZ) Islander can probably offer some better answers than I so I'll let him respond if he wants to. Bobokus' thread is also a great read on finding and using the correct "range" for using ones fib correctly. Islanders method is kind of a Skunny/Bobokus hybrid method.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Well no, swings. But I meant the DZ = being the range which seemed to lead into a "long or short" decision type of thing. I'm not yet very clear of what's really going on is the thing probably Well, yes, but I don't ever do anything on pure movement alone if there isn't some PA to go with it and usually there's only 1-2 "main" fibs on large TF outlining an area where to look for it..i.e. what I mean is the fibs are just one of many hints like s/r and TLs are, whereas what's actually traded is other stuff, which is why I'm curious about what's being done here. I might take a gander, but it seems Skunny's at least is missing a clear and concise "abstract"(i.e. summary) to orient oneself by - or so it seems many have complained

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Hi SL - I have no problems with your question, for me, the main use of fibonacci is for identifying retracement areas in which price makes its decision either to turn back inside the Decision Zone (the 38.2 - 61.8% retracements) and carry on its prior move OR to pass straight thru the Decision Zone and reverse its previous direction. Whichever decision the market elects to take, the price action itself inside the DZ gives important clues as to the strength or weakness of the move. Thursday and Friday were good examples of pull backs into the DZ prior to the continuation of the down move. NB I'm not suggesting that I was able to get ALL of the moves that I highlighted, allowances must be made for slippage and spread. I personally do not like the idea of waiting for the breakout of a prior High or Low as I've seen way too many of these turn out to be fakeouts. Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Whilst I do thank Skunny for putting me on the road to Naked Trading I found his lack of follow up frustrating and early on in his thread I started this one in an attempt to show my interpretation of his cryptic comments, which can be very confusing to newbies. Despite PMs and emails to him, I have never received any reply either confirming or denying my interpretation. For those needing a more detailed explaination, I would suggest that they read this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=50767 Bobokus is a very experienced trader who I understand taught Skunny about fibonacci. That thread is continually updated with real time trades, comments and help and is real example IMO of what is best in FF.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Good Morning. Since the bounce following Friday's sell off, there have been several Sell signals from inside the DZ. However, so far, these have failed to make new lows and the higher low off the mid pivot line at 200.29 warns of the possibility of a larger retracement - TWT

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Down to the 5m for a narrower fib and the tweezers / rail road tracks around the Frankfurt Open have shown a buy as price failed to continue down into the DZ and is now above the Daily Pivot. IMO its best to wait to see the action after the London Open in 40 mins. Mondays can be difficult days to trade as the market searches for direction...

--- 帖子 #844 ---
At present, UJ is the main driving force pulling GJ up. Its now into the DZ on its hourly chart, so its action over the next few hours is important. The Swissy is also rallying - and has now reached its 50% retrace of its last fall on the hourly chart.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
It doesn't get any clearer than this. You really do have to love the 50% retraces! Take some profit on the long off the 5 min and and wait for some confirmation that the 50% is going to hold before thinking of a sell.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
As we now know, the narrower range fib only stalled GJ and with cable's positive news - which gave it a 100 pip boost - GJ is now into the wider - 200 pip - DZ on this fib. I had kept some of my position open and also took an add on from the inside bar break out off my 30 min chart - that quickly hit my 100 pip target http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Currently, cable has stalled at its 9600 resistance - also 50% fib at 1.9605. Whilst the Swissy stalled at its 50% fib and UJ in the bottom of its DZ, they are both trying to move north again. This could be an interesting US session.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Cable has given a Sell Signal, breaking down out of its hourly DZ after peaking at 9630, 25 pips above its 50% retrace. UJ has held in a tight range around the bottom of its hourly DZ. However, the Swissy did manage to give a Sell Signal as it too broke south from its DZ. It is now in a wedge with support from a higher low TL at 1.0410 and resistance from a steep downtrend line at 466. Which ever way swissy breaks, UJ will follow.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
All of the above has left GJ in a tight range, but still held inside the gann down trending channel. It has finally broken down out of its DZ, but needs to break under its Daily Pivot at 202.28 to confirm the move. The UK CPI data is due at 4:30 am EST - 2 hours time.

Thanks for taking the time to reply and indulging me I'll have a look-see there as well. I've always liked Fibs and market symmetry as an idea, but in practice more complex things like that always seemed a looooooooot of work just to get something to "fit", whereas retracements and projections are a very simple and quick tool I like to use. So maybe there's an idea or two that will be interesting along those lines, I'll check it out. Thanks

Issy, My 1H intra-day fibs are showing some signs of possible strength to the upside. Cable is bouncing off of it's lower support level UJ holding above its upper support level GJ still holding above its upper DZ zone.....

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Good Morning Pip - agreed, I was just posting this chart elsewhere - its got the 50% and DP to break. Also, Cable's now on its 500 level support and Swissy / UJ are both sideways....TWT

--- 帖子 #852 ---
You're welcome - and I agree about the KISS principle - for me, the retracement into the DZ plus the daily pivots and then watching Price Action around these levels are all that's needed. I dont get too fixated about fibs - they're just another tool and neither do I trade breakouts - that's too late and too dangerous... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

Early in the US session cable failed to break lower and I bought the bounce up off the S1 pivot at 9437. Now I'm waiting to see cable's reaction to its 9500 level and the 50% retrace on this chart. I'm starting to think that the BOE may not be able to cut rates for some time due to the inflationary pressures and that could lead to a larger rally in cable.....TWT

My thoughts from the 15 m chart...... The left fib is drawn across the whole of yesterdays range of ~360 pips and earlier today GJ retraced to the bottom of the Decision Zone (61.8%) - aslo S1. The rally from there allowed the center set of fibs to be drawn over the tighter 240 pip range and that rally retraced to just above the 50% and close to the 203 level. The right side fib has a 120 pip range and GJ has already retraced into the DZ and given a continuation buy on its exit. Now we wait to see IF GJ can break out to new highs. If it cant, then I would remove the right fib and move the center fib up to the latest high and work off that as during the Asian Session the range is normally less than the combined Europe &amp; US sessions that we are just completing. Just my opinion! Attached Thumbnails http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1210703031 __________________

GJ Hourly fib range from the last move showing support has held, UJ still bullish from good US retail sales news earlier today. Cable could still spoil the party for GJ though.......

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Current chart - a clear buy yesterday afternoon as GJ pulled back into its DZ and quickly reversed north again. Not a convincing move with GJ holding at the weekly pivot level. Now in Frankies Hour its having a second attempt and I've already taken partial profits as the Swissy has turned lower and thus UJ is unlikely to break its 105 resistance area. Cable is drifting in the bottom of its current range - I took nice profits yesterday when it failed to break above 9500. Edit: LOL - the Brits bought the dollar, swissy and thus UJ up, euro and cable down. Result for GJ - conflict = sideways chop whilst we wait to see which of these moves has more legs.....

--- 帖子 #857 ---
The rally was 196 pips before failing just under the 205 level - plenty of opportunities to bank pips there. I took a sell based on swissy's PA and benefited greatly from cables drop.... Cable has just dropped after the "buy the rumour, sell the news" type of move - nice signals there too and it hit its prior low 9361 before bouncing and I also had shorts there. Now I'll watch the action around the latest DZ before entering again

Wow Islander, do you ever lose? If you get a chance, could you post some entries showing stop areas and where you took profit, or moved stop to BE. This would really be beneficial to those trying to learn this methodology. I understand this takes time to do, so no worries if you do not have that. Cheers, Steve

--- 帖子 #859 ---
...i've been thinking this too...to get a better feel for decision making within the DZ before entry (especially on the 5min setups) would be great to see more or less as it happens....also appreciate the demand on time to do this and the thread may not be the most practical medium to use. Good work Islander

--- 帖子 #860 ---
LOL Steve - yes I loose, usually from poor trading rather than a problem with the methodology and I post the moves, not my trades. At present I rarely use stops and dont hold overnight - for me that's say 5pm EDT till 1am EDT - hence I was in and out of the last swing that I posted. I'm also making other trades not posted so trying to remember and take more time here is difficult. If you read a few pages you'll soon get the idea of what I do, then just run a few weeks as a backtest - but following in real time is by far the best way to go -IMO.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Thanks CC - I'll try to elaborate later - I have to go out for a couple of hours - also my post above may help.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Hey Islander, if I may ask a quick question, just to see whether I've got the basic principle here... Assuming the "main swing" is the one going DOWN, the current rally a retracement, is this chart laid out correctly and will we move to 138.2% after 50% retrace according to all this skunnybobosizzlizingbarbequesteaksfibos stuff? That 50% =&gt; 138.2% stuff is what I've learned from another fella on J16, so I'm wondering whether we're not all doing the same thing in the end after all

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hi SL - your chart's fine - mine's similar. However, I dont trade off the 4 hour - the hourly &amp; 15 m are my main TFs. The IFibs are taken from Bo's work and the idea is to take a trade based on the price action inside the DZ or on the exit from it - and yes, very often GJ will turn close to the 50% retracement. However, I personally do not get fixated about targets - be it the 1.382 extension, the 1.618 or the 2.618. There are plenty of more "natural" levels that all traders can see, rather than an arbitrarily placed fib level that you or I have drawn - no matter how experienced we may be http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Getting the entry is for me the key - then its down to managing the trade and that IMO is more personal trading style / trading goals rather than a fixed target. I'll be interested to have your input too, as a fellow experienced active trader who's taking real time decisions. Regards Issy

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Right. So we've demystified 2-4 thread's worth with a few thousand posts to "In forex, price often likes to retrace before moving on. Possible targets for that move include, but are not limited to extension, s/r and other techs also influence price." if I understand correctly. That's really all I (and some others it seems) tried to figure out in almost a dozen posts now - what the whole stuff is supposed to be about As for input, at the moment I'm stumped as I'm opinionated strongly bearish carry, yet it's doing the opposite and disconnecting itself partly from stocks. So all a bit weird. We'll see how the daily bars end.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
LOL - me too - the current 50 day average range is 276 pips. Today's range so far is 157 pips and we're back right in the middle. Luckily for me is nearing the end of my trading day, so I'll keep my banked pips safe and have an early Sundowner. Cheers Issy

--- 帖子 #866 ---
A narrow range day of 160 pips against the 50 day average of 267 pips. This is an indication of an impending range expansion as - to quote the master of volatility trading Tony Crabel - Volatility is Mean Returning. So expect action soon! Also, this narrow range has given a Linda Raschke type NR4 6/100 set up, where the breakout of yesterdays range triggers an entry - whilst Linda trades the Stock Markets, IMO the set up should be valid for FX too. Either way, I'll take the break out of the DZ!

GJ broke down and fell over 70 pips.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Fantastic! Incredibly accurate Islander.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Thanks Rialto. I'm having a break from running this thread as I'm finding it is distracting me from my trading. I believe that I've shown how useful the Decison Zone can be and how I've been using it as one tool to help with making trading decisions. For those who need more input, just go to Bobokus's thread. Whilst he only posts on GBPUSD, there's plenty of input and loads of charts and follow up. I wish you all many pips into your accounts.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Issy

Yes Guys, this is what I mentioned in the room....enjoy.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Just say BIG thanks for ISLANDER who open my eyes to alot of things

For old times sake......

And how I traded that chart....

here's the pivot indy - not shown on chart, to keep it as clear as poss....also sweet spots http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

GM Issy. Ressurection eh?

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Use of fib expansion.....will it hold at this one, or run up another 50 pips....Time Will Tell http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

LOL - stand by to welcome visitors Not certain yet, but it saves me clogging up other people's threads

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Geeze - glad I'm helping someone - happy trading...... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

Updated chart - the last 100 pip rally hit the 161.8 fib extension - a really great day for fibs - the sweet spots and VSA helped me to pirate plenty of pips too..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif Note - the huge red spike up - a shooting star / inverted hammer - was on the ECB news release - a smaller rate cut that expected Congratulations to Shamus who was up over 500 pips in his long GU - and thanks to Vantage for pointing out that last entry off the 4600 level as I was busy elsewhere.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #880 ---
There was a retrace into the fib Decision Zone, followed by another attempt to make a new high - it failed and thus became a sell - I did. VSAwise, there is supply above 4700 and IMO this is starting to look like distribution as well as profit taking.....I'm selling rallies.....

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Good to see you posting on your old thread Issy.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hey Pip - good to see you again too - hope you're getting some pips into your bank....

--- 帖子 #399 ---
This morning's action.....a fast fake-out during the Frankfurt Hour held at the 4650 level, 10 pips above todays Daily Pivot at 4640. This allowed the pro's to get in with early longs for the expected run up into the news - see Tom William's book for info on this kind of action - you can find it in Shamus's VSA thread http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif It was another hour before the accumulation took effect and cable then quickly put on 125 pips to stall at the confluence of the 825 ss and R1 pivot at 4830 - a great place to exit longs and go for a small short for the pull back. If you pull a fib from the last mini low at the 675 level up to the high, you find the 38 level is ~the 775 ss and the 50% is at the 750 level....lets see which of these becomes the support for the next rally. But remember that this is a Freaky NFP Friday, so be careful..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon11.gif Edit: For some reason the FO / LO time lines are an hour out on this saved version - they should be an hour earlier - my apologies

As I did start this thread as a Yen thread, here's the GJ chart - very similar to GU except its range is 100 pips greater......memo to self, perhaps I'd better start trading GJ again.....

GM - a nice start to my week - a push down early in Frankies Hour gave some nice buys, the second one at the green arrow gave 50 pips followed by a pull back to the 61.8% level and another 15 pips......now its best to wait and see what The Brits are going to do.........

--- 帖子 #404 ---
GJ's chart was identical - or even clearer for the 50% retrace entry. The first Buy was worth ~100 pips and the second / third entry good for ~60 pips so far. The fib expansions are suggesting a move to over the 152 level, which will need to see GU up to its 1.5000 level......Time Will Tell....... PS - I've been buying pull backs all morning..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

Hi Islander, A couple of weeks ago, I caught whiff of skunny's thread, which led me to Bo's thread and now yours. A lot of reading and burning the midnight oil. But anyway, your shorter TF for me! (and now with you reading markets with volume, interesting!) Where can I get that volume indicator that you have? I also read the VSA thread by Shamus which is also interesting. Even forex has no real volume, I do believe that its shows market activity and when used correctly, it is possible to use to profit from it. Looks like stream is going from this thread but I like to keep this going!
