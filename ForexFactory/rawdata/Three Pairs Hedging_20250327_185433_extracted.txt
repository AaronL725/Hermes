Hi Guys,

I am a great fan of hedging ;-)

Here I show you how I hedge "circel pairs" = GBPUSD > USDCHF > GBPCHF"

"Circel pairs" means each currency "GBP" "USD" and "CHF" appears twice in these three pairs.

GBPUSD = Buy

USDCHF = Buy

GBPCHF = Sell

or

GBPUSD = Sell

USDCHF = Sell

GBPCHF = Buy

I used no indicator at all, but it took sometimes a while to get in profit.

I used same lotsize on all three pairs and TP of 100$

One might say, hey, why did you not trade just GBPUSD and GBPCHF?

Because, it causes such a big DD which can blow an account in very short time, so please do not try this at home ;-)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here some more examples for three pairs hedging:

BUY             BUY             SELL

or               SELL             SELL             BUY

EUR/CHF             CHF/JPY             EUR/JPY

GBP/CHF             CHF/JPY             GBP/JPY

USD/CHF             CHF/JPY             USD/JPY

EUR/GBP             GBP/CHF             EUR/CHF

EUR/USD             USD/CHF             EUR/CHF

EUR/GBP             GBP/JPY             EUR/JPY

EUR/GBP             GBP/USD             EUR/USD

EUR/USD             USD/JPY             EUR/JPY

GBP/USD             USD/CHF             GBP/CHF

GBP/USD             USD/JPY             GBP/JPY

There are still some more opportunities, but then the spreads are very high!

I used a simple EA, where I only had to enter the three pairs, whether I  want to open a sell or buy order for the single pairs, the lotsize and  the TP. It did not use any indicator and opened new trades as soon as  the previous ones where closed.

But I do not have this EA and do not know its name anymore. But I had it  from this forum. I would have preferred to have automatic Lot size  (calculated by percentage of free margin) and automatic TP (calculated  by percentage of equity).

hello Cash,

Thanks for your thread.  I do not understand what you mean by take profit is $100.  Look at the TP coulmn in your trading report.  You have values greater that $100.  Also I do not know what your stop loss is.

It appears that you had very large draw downs in some trades......., some draw downs almost 30% of your account size??

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Yes sometime this EA did not close the trades so I had to close them manually. The DD is not that high, because when one pair gets down, another pair compensates this DD.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
A $2910.00 draw down out of a $10,000 account is not that HIGH to you????

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This is not a high draw down, when the other pair has about the same size in plus! Therefore we trade the other pairs as well. Don`t you get it?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Maxwell I think you are missing something...

When you have that -2910$ at the same time you have that +3667$ and -558$ so it's not a drawdown....the net value is +199$ more or less

There is an italian famous trader that works in a similar way....

--- 帖子 #7 ---
With hedging you'll always show "drawdown" when in reality the equity on the account may very well be up, as one pair goes negative while the other (or two) go positive.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks for the explanation man.  I see my mistake now....!  I had to take all the three traded pairs in consideration.

Anyway Cash, Would you mind posting the trade trigger EA since with this method it is important to enter a trade with all three at thesame time.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
With a draw down that is manageable the system could show very good results

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi

Looking at your result it appears that you would have been more profitable if you changed it to

GBPUSD=BUY

USDCHF=SELL

GBPCHF=SELL

GBPUSD=SELL

USDCHF=BUY

GBPCHF=BUY

Have you tried it this way? What setup do you use to enter a trade?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Try it, and you will blow your account!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I think in your example you are not hedged....

Hedging means that you are flat on the market with every currency

If you do something like you say:

GBPUSD=BUY

USDCHF=SELL

GBPCHF=SELL

you are hedged only on GBPUSD but you remain double short on USD and double long on CHF...the same think as opening 2 positions short on USDCHF

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Sorry to write that, what you show is the opposite of hedging!

Just try it and you will find out yourself.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I know perfectly...I was just showing that to Rglenn

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks Chris that makes sense! Never used hedging before - maybe it might be worthwhile looking into.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
GBPUSD and USDCHF are negative correlated, which should be always traded sell sell or buy buy.

USDCHF and GBPCHF are positive correlated,which should be always traded sell buy or buy sell.

GBPUSD and GBPCHF are also positive correlated,which should be always traded sell buy or buy sell.

So, please do not mix it up!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Cash,

What will be your trading rules like?

I mean:

1. Any limits to the number of trades (as per Buy or Sell basket)? I see your results that sometimes you do more than 1 set of Buy or Sell in a trading day.

2. Any particular session(s)?

3. Entry requirement(s)? Or just enter Buy / Sell basket when closed the previous basket with profit?

Hoping someone will code this EA for us.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Maybe there is a misunderstanding....

I AGREE with you....it was not me to mix it up...it was Rglenn and I was just explaining it to him....

English is not my mother language so maybe I've said something wrong but I repeat...I AGREE with you Cash4u2

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I did not use any signals or indicators, the EA opened orders with the same lotsize on the three pairs and closed it in profit. After the close it opened the next trades directly.

But I guess an useful indicator could speed up the positive trades.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I really wonder.. is it so easy to make money in forex. I have tried such systems earlier but not so much profitable. and one of the reason is brokers spread.

Well  i have attached like same ea you may be talking about... it is for 4 pairs... anybody can enter 3 pair and leave 4th pair blank..

Well best of luck for your new thread!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
The only edge I can see in this idea is the inefficiency in lot sizing. By keeping all of the lot sizes the same, even though they are not equivalent in base deposit currency causes a near but not perfect hedge.  It took me a minute to figure out where the edge was.  The not perfect hedge is where the profit or loss can be made.

This is interesting to me, because you can have a loss on this, but it probably will not be very much and you can just wait it out for it to revert to the profit side and then close the trade.  This method does not require any stop losses, because the three can never drift very far apart.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
OK, but how would you calculate the lotsize for the single pairs?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I used correlation trades many times before, but correlations do change.

It's all good until you hit the wall eventually. For example CHF/JPY (USDCHF /USDJPY and so on)

pairs are usually correlated but ones I catches when CHF goes weak and JPY strong,

that's when I get killed last time.. It will eventually go back to normal,

but you will not stand such DD's.. And I actually was using charts and

grab correlation trades only when 2 pairs was a part at most, if you going

to buy just everywhere you like without even looking? Be my guest

This thread will die like another 100 discussing correlated trades.

Up to date nobody was able to generate any sustainable profit from

it..  I'll be glad if your method would work.. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I would not want to. I think how you are doing it is fine and is it's profit. If you adjust the lots sizes to form a perfect hedge, there is no loss and no profit and a transaction cost, which would be a net loss.

To add, really there is no edge here, because you are hoping to gain with a money management technique. That is not an edge, sorry

--- 帖子 #25 ---
This method really has nothing to do with correlations at all.

Why do you bring up correlations?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thx for your answer! I just wanted to double check, because I was thinking exactly the same ;-)

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Well the key here is no matter whether you use a fixed lot size or a percent of margin or a percent of account equity, is to absolutely keep all three lot sizes the same. You could figure out a optimized differential between the lot sizes, but that would be the stuff of a quant and would only slightly improve performance, for a retail trader like we are.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Is that so? very good, than how do you hedge?

It's the same thing.. Basically when you try to hedge you are using

negative or positive correlated pair.. For example if your EU LONG trade is

tanking you can try to hedge it by shorting CABLE (correlated pair)..

Same here if you grab correlated pair correlation can go in loss or profit, - you just wait when it

goes in ++++ and close the trades.

Try it on Demo first, cause I know the long term outcome..

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Are you trying to waste time here. please read my last few posts I fully explained it.  You are pulling my leg, right?

You are thinking in terms of pairs and we are talking in terms of currency offsets.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
And consider to have smaller TP, for lot size 1 lot use like 40-50$ because

sometimes it could hit 50$ few times than go to +$80 and then go back

to Loss, better grab smaller profit more often..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Correlation is important for three pairs hedging, because you need to know, where to sell and where to buy. But it is much safer like hedging two pairs.

Three pairs is like, two pairs to equalize the minus and plus and the third pair is the profitmaker.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi cash4u2 and thanks for sharing your strategy.

I noticed that the 3 trades opened on 2010/11/22 were closed for a net loss. Why didn't you wait for them to be in profit and close them then?

thanks

Vlan

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I know you are using 2 to 1 like buy 2 pairs sell 1 and so on..

but it's still based on pair correlations.  Anyways, no problem, however

you name it.. This exact system/method was presented here about

4-5 month ago.. I even have EA somewhere.. You can try, maybe you

got extremely lucky

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks for the info and discussing your method. I think that is it in a nutshell for me. I wish you the best with it.

Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #35 ---
SkyzerFX, would be great, when you already have got an EA for this. Maybe you can post it ;-)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Exactly but it could be a loss maker as well, since I don't think

there is 100% exact weight 2 against 1 pairs.. I can find that EA and run it

again for those pairs on Demo, worth to try it out one more time..

Thank you.

P.S

Ok lemme dig for EA, should be somewhere

--- 帖子 #37 ---
How long do you trade this way? Consistent profitable?

Thanks

tordi

--- 帖子 #38 ---
tordi, I could only trade it for a short period of two month, before I had an accident, which mad me stay in hospital until the last week. Now I want to continue it, because I believe, this has a great potential.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
All the best, good luck and health for you. I will also test this. Looks good.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Well I am sorry, but I do not agree with this. If you were to match up all off the lot sizes so they were equivalent  for each currency in the set of three pairs, they would cancel each other out exactly and there is no connection to correlation of pairs.  The only benefit in this system is the lot size differential and that is all.   Now if you were to pick say two pairs that were strongly trending and use the third as your safety net, that might improve profits, but still nothing to do with correlation of the pairs. Correlations are not important here. the cancellation of the currencies are what is at play here.

At the end of the day, The Only Way to make any profit with this is to have an inefficiency in lot sizing between pairs ( your using the same lot size for all for example ) and no other form of setup will influence the outcome if all of the lot sizes were equivalent in terms of deposit currency.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
OK here it is hopefully this is last one I use

I wrote this based on other EA... Let me explain here:

//---- input parameters

extern double    Lot1=0.1;

extern double    Lot2=0.1;

extern double    Lot3=0.1;

extern string    Sym1="EURUSD";

extern string    Sym2="GBPUSD";

extern string    Sym3="EURJPY";

extern double    Commission1=0.0;

extern double    Commission2=0.0;

extern double    Commission3=0.0;

extern double    Profit=20;

extern double    slippage=2.0;

double Ilo1=0, Ilo2=0, Ilo3=0;

===========================================

Let's say you want to use this on 3 different SET PAIRS then you have

to use Different Lot size for each SET

Let say 1 SET of 3 pairs using Lot size 1.0

Next  SET of 3 Pairs should then use 1.01 ( or 0.9 or 1.10 for each pair in the next set, whatever you want just

different of the previous set/sets) and so on//

Why? because each of the SET can have same pair in their SET and

to calculate profit for appropriate set EA have to know which set this

pair belongs (what sum to calculate)

to and we only can verify this buy changing the lot size to different value..

You only have to drop EA on 1 Chart any of those 3 Pairs (but trades should be open, or you have to open them

after you drop EA according to the settings you specify)

Profit Input Specifying PROFIT IN USD$$$ not pips

Specify which pairs you going to use, then specify lot sizes for this pairs SET you going to use and just drag and drop..

Important : FIRST you have to PLACE TRADES MANUALLY.. then drag and drop that EA and specify your Lot size And stuff, so

EA knows what to monitor, ONES Profit Target is hit in USD$ terms, EA will close the Trades automatically,

so Basically it's semi automatic..

EA will also display what is your current Profit/Loss on the specifying SET of PAIRS..

If someone knows how to program you can modify this code and let EA open the trades..

But it's not a big deal.. I hope this is the last version I used.. Make sure it's working first (it SHOULD, cause

I used it on Real ACC ), try it on demo..

P.S

For Commissions leave 0.0 unless you want to also calculate commissions and made your Target Profit Taking

20$ (example)  excluding commissions, but then you can just simply use higher value for Profit Taking..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thx, SkyzerFX, I will try this one. And sell is minus lotsize like -0.1?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So sorry to hear about your accident, and will pray for your recovery.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
So you are using an EA with no indicators to trigger your trades.

How do you determine your first trade?

If 1st basket is BUY BUY SELL and closed with profits, will the next basket be BUY BUY SELL or SELL SELL BUY? How does your EA decides?

P.S. Maybe i'm confusing myself ... ...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thank you - I survived and I'm getting better every day!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
cash4u2:

Keep doing what you are doing.  You do not have to prove anything to anybody.  Ignore the naysayers.

I understand exactly what you are doing.  YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  Keep exploiting market inefficiencies!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I agree with you here 100% . I think the Lot size differential is a interesting concept that allows one to take advantage when the three are in profit and ride it out when they are in loss. Just always close the trades when in the profit side.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
You decide whether you want bbs or ssb. The problem with this EA was, that it did not close the trades sometimes and I had to close them manually.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you.

Now no more cloud blocking the sun

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Adjusting the lot size will work against you.  This strategy requires nothing more than patience and controlling one's greed.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
To avoid having to change the lot size for each set of three trades to say 1.01, you could manage open orders using either a magic number (for which the trades would have to have been placed by an EA not manually) or by order comment, which can be entered when placing trades manually or by an EA.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Maybe you can post the source code of the EA that you are using and someone kind enough will modify it as per your trading rules

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Sorry, but I do not have it and I even do not know the name of this EA, anymore. But it was from this forum.

The rules are very simple, open the given orders, buy-buy-sell or sell-sell-buy, with same lotsize for each pairs, as shown on first post.

Close all three trades, when in profit.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
You are welcome,

no no, lot sizes should be positive

Doesn't matter, if it's sell or buy.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Yeah that was my idea, I find easier to just use the Lot Size, since

I was using 0.10/0.11 and so on and there is no big difference on the

outcome, perhaps for little higher size of lot you can pump a Profit size,

And I never use more than let's say 3 sets of pairs.. Besides, sometime

it will take more than 24 hours to reach the profit target..

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The EA SkyzerFX posted in Post #39 manages open orders for one set of 3 trades, after you enter the trades manually.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Maybe it's this one?

I found it in my notebook but i never tried it

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I have another one, but I create that one I post from it.

You probably miss that My EA also using same lot size for all 3 pairs

in set, but since it's doesn't have Magic number if you want to run more

than 1 SET on the same account I use slightly different lot sizes for each

sets, that's it.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
OK, now I got it, thought it does also open trades ;-)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Pretty much the same here:

This one have Magic Number, but it using 4 Pairs instead, you can

delete 1 pair from the code.  I didn't used that one, I used mine..

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I've coded a very basic version of an EA to open and close trades as per post #1 rules...but I need to wait a few hours for market open in order to see if it works...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
thx for this info, Chris_B

--- 帖子 #63 ---
This method accomplishes nothing except placing a trade on usd/chf and  just holding on to it until it shows a profit. Say you place the trades  with 10,000 units per pair buying g/u and u/c and selling g/c. That will  just leave you with approx 6100 units short u/c exposure with no gbp  exposure whatsoever. This is absolutely no different, if you're opening  and closely these pairs together, than just placing a trade short  usd/chf. And using 3 pairs to accomplish this does nothing to limit risk, drawdown or anything else except increase your transaction costs.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
As has been stated previously, a perfect hedge would involve altering the lots traded for each pair and would certainly not be a profitable strategy.

Since you are trading the same lot size for all three pairs, you are in essence trading just one pair.

Take EURCHF (Long) EURUSD (Short) USDCHF (Short) for an example. When trading equal lot sizes among these three pairs, you are, for the most part, trading USDCHF (Long). When the price of USDCHF goes far enough above your entry price to offset the spread/commission and to reach your profit target, you will be successful. However, if you enter at the start of an extended downtrend for USDCHF, bad things will happen.

I ran this scenario (Long EC, Short EU, UC) through several backtests. I specifically wanted to pick a point where USDCHF was starting a downtrend. The attached screenshot shows the USDCHF M5 chart and an equity chart of the basket. Trades were opened 9/5/2010 17:41:45 ET and close 9/9/2010 21:53:23 ET.

Long EURCHF 0.5 Lots Open 1.31055 Close 1.29425

Short EURUSD 0.5 Lots Open 1.28855 Close 1.26660

Short USDCHF 0.5 Lots Open 1.01660 Close 1.02190

As you can see, the basket performance mimics the movement of USDCHF. When USDCHF finally crept above the entry by enough pips, the Profit target of $30.00 was reached and the basket was closed. Max DD in this case was about 2.65%. Spikes in the equity chart are usually caused by excessive spreads during times of low liquidity (ie, rollover).

Edit: Funny that Lonestar posted the same thing just a few seconds before I did!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi zznbrm, which backtest tool did you use to be able to use three pairs?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Looking forward

Hope can custom pairs to trade as well

For discussion:

Theoretically, since it does not really matter if it is BBS or SSB, do you think it makes more money if the EA is placed to two charts with one on BBS and the other one on SSB (EA to close on dollar profit of 50)?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
that was exactly my first thought, reading the topic. i don't see any sense in hedging 3 crossrates with each other, but paying the spread 3 times. it's like trying to speculate on oil, while hedging yourself against rising oil price. or better its like playing red AND black at the same time on a roulette table, the only thing you do is paying for the 36

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I modified an indicator found here
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=2230

for three pairs. I also added the ability to input spreads for the three pairs.

Read about how to use it from the above link.

Now you can test the method while the market is closed with this indicator

The funny part is going to be when no one believes what we're saying until this thread goes about 100 pages and about 12 ea's and indicators to prove it versus just thinking and trying to understand what others are saying and not getting caught up in the hype.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Dont think alot of people understand what "exposure" is. Thats the problem. I know when I started it took me awhile to grasp that fact.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yes, I agree with you the same shows up here.  The shape of the equity curve is the same for the 3 pair hedge and just selling the usdchf. only the dollars are different, because I did not take the time to figure out exactly the ratio of lot sizes for each currency in reference to usdchf.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
hi,

sorry if this is not the right place for my question, and i apologize for my bad english but i am searching for an hedging ea.

i explain it what i mean.

An Ea that hedges my manual ordert positions,

-20 pips from my entry is the entry of the hedge position in the opposite site

the take profit from my hedge position is the stop loss from my manual ordered position

the stop loss from my hedge position is 5pips

and the ea is not allowed to open orders only when i open manual orders

thats all

i hope you understand and i thank you if somebody can help me to find such an ea

best regards

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Meaning?

Worthwhile carry on with the rules as per Post #1 or ... ... ?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Well, that is up to you. The method can be profitable. However, the same trade can be done in one pair, but it takes some thought to setup the one pair trade.  This does not require much thought, but you pay for it in transaction costs as I said earlier.  So you have to make that choice.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Meaning there is no such strategy when you can just placed hedged

trades and go to sleep, if this was possible, nobody wouldn't even

care to look at the charts. If profit can be made then there is always

a risk for loss and Forex is on the place #1, for me it's not much away

from

simple gambling in the casino, when the house got little advantage,

same as brokers on Forex and same as Bookers on Sport betting..

The only things, I see working by far is Large account and very small lots

keep buying/selling averaging the few different pairs.. It works, but

you can get sucked in for few weeks in the wrong trade, but eventually

what goes up, must comedown.. Like buying USDJPY below 81, could it

go to 70? maybe but averaging down will work eventually, I'm trying this

approach with small account and penny lots,, working like a clock..

Other than that, I found no system working since I start looking.

Bare charts, simple Fibs, few trend lines, all you need and still this is

pretty much guessing: "Up or down?" take your pick.

P.S: Sure there should be something and most likely that something it's simple :

1) Money Management

2) Discipline

3) Fear and Greed Management

4) Reasonable expectations (better 20$ now then(IF) $100 later

5) Money goes to money = very little chance to made something with nothing..

Sure, there is something else (but I'm watching charts now).. Good luck..

--- 帖子 #78 ---
smjones, could you code your "Stochastic different pairs" for 3 pairs?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
What is the math?

One line indicator: First + Second - Third?

Three line indicator: First - Second and First - Third and Second - Third?

Not obvious, to me, what you want.

Your reply is definitely cool!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Well anybody started testing of this strategy with ea?

One thing I am worry about is brokers spread which will play major role in live account.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
tjfxtrader, could you load up your two indicators, which you've posted here?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I think it will be interesting to test both basket at a same time.

ie ea will open buy buy sell and sell sell buy basket at a time and monitor each basket with magic no. and should close basket that hit profit target and reopen the same...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yeah, that really is an interesting idea. I think that's a hedge of the hedge and one hedge of them will always be positive...

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Yes, this would be the best to do, instead of trading other three pairs.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
How have you all been doing with this method? You've now had the US session to trade, what are you profits?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Could someone add a magic number to both EAs?

The 1. one is for buy - buy - sell on GBPUSD - USDCHF - GBPCHF

The 2. one is for sell - sell - buy on GBPUSD - USDCHF - GBPCHF

I would like to open trades right after attaching both EAs on the charts, but they do not open trades and are waiting for something. Maybe s.o. can check this too.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Well just send your idea to any broker , they will love to programm an EA for you.

Bcuz your essentially just paying 6 times spreads while staying absolutly flat.

I think this whole "strategy" can go into two directions :

a) Grid Trading like Averaging with just one pair you have the exposure to         or

b) "True" Hedging with correct lot sizes also known as Triangular Arbitrage

Take your time and think about it. And bear in mind , there is no such thing as riskless profit.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hey cash,

the bots do open the trades with alpari.uk.

Heres a screenshot

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Yes, both EAs do open trades but it takes a while until the second EA opens his trades. There is still a magic number needed otherwise neither EA will close his trades.

At your screenshot it shows also, that second EA opened trades 13 minutes later than the first trades.

here is nice little ea that will close all pending and open trades when profit is reached....

Hi cash4u2,

Don't you mean SSB for the first where GBPCHF is below 20

And BBS for the second where GBPCHF is above 80?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
When GBPUSDand USDCHF is above 80 and GBPCHF below 20,

we trade GBPUSDand USDCHF (buy - buy) and GBPCHF (sell)

Shouldn't we sell high and buy low?!?

Hey DL,

i don't think there's much experience with this method by now. Take a look at SQ's fine backtesting indicator with 3 pairs. There seems to be some potential when one of the 3 pairs drifts away and gets out of sync..

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Yes, that should be interesting. If the BBS works, by the same logic so should the SSB. And seems to be no reason why they can't then work together, as long as the ea recognises the p/l for each group separately, and not the global p/l for the six trades.

I don't think the effect will be flat with this hedge of a hedge, since the markets don't move in a stratight line but oscillate - when the net goes positive, that profit is booked. So in that sense if there is a lot of oscillations, presumably you will be realising profits on both groups. Even if one group say then goes negative for a prolonged period, you should have realised equivalent profit on the other group. Until such time as the negative group comes back. Point being that in the meantime, you should have a fair bit of realised profit.

All the above ofcourse ignores spread, not sure how much difference that will make ultimately.

Or is the logic completely wrong?

Would love to find out.

Hope one of our experts can have a look at the ea's to add in Magic Number, 2) make sure it opens trades on ecn/ non ecn platforms - it doesn't seem to open trades on Broco for instance, maybe becoz its 4 digits? 3) Preferably allow for different suffixes.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Maybe the ea should monitor the stochastic for each pair, and only then automatically open the necessary trades. Wouldn't that be great as an option? Wish I know how to program!!!!

Pardy

--- 帖子 #102 ---
You are correct. It will not be flat. You will lose double to transaction costs with no chance to profit. Think about it for a moment. If the lot sizes are the same for either approach and the only advantage this method has is the fact that the same lot size for each pair is not equivalent int terms of deposit currency. then you have just neutralized that advantage. Note that I use the word advantage, because it is not an edge. This is technically only a money management system, because the same trade can be down with the odd currency pair alone. What you suggest simply negates the single currency. Note also that this type of trade setup is not allowed in the US, because it is technically nedging, to use melin's term.

The thread starter has presented a profitable system.  What gives you reason to make changes?

I bow respectfully of course to your considerable knowledge and logic. I was taking a rather simplistic view in the sense that if BBs is profitable over a period of time, so too should the SSB. If at all this way is profitable, then person A could only trade BBS and make some money at some point, and person B could trade just SSB and make some money similarly. Assuming the method works. Now you could trade both yourself if say A represents one account, and B represents another, both belonging to the one person. (All assuming again that the method works profitably in the first place).

Extending that thought then, if A and B represent now not two separate accounts but the two different groups and can be each managed separately within one account ( through use of magic numbers) as if it were two separate accounts for the purposes of realising profit, that should then work. For accounts in the UK, there is of course no problem with hedging.

Example, BBS is opened on say 02/02/11 and achieves its target of $20 on 05/02/11. Next BBS opened on 05/02/11 and achieves target of $20 on 09/02/11. Total gain $40.

SSB is opened on same day 02/02/11 and achieves its target of $20 on 06/02/11. Next SSB opened on 06/02/11 and achieves its target of $20 on 11/02/11. Total gain $40.

Thus aggregate gain = $80.

In between 02/02/11 and 11/02/11 there will be points in time with drawdowns or net flat or some profit of course.

I still don't fully understand it, at the back of my mind is if its too good to be true........... Nice to find out though in the safe environment of a demo account.

I've noticed the same thing, it will work safely with the 3 Pairs Hedging strategy.

If you drift away from using the 3 Pairs Hedging strategy because you saw an opportunity by trading the negatively correlated pairs in opposite directions, you'd be risking your account as stochastic lines can remain in ob/os zones for a long time.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Correct, I've tried this yesterday with my own basic EA to manage two separate baskets (BBS, SSB) of same pairs each with their own MagicNumber and there is no edge doing this, unless you're the Broker!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I like that saying: "Great minds think alike"

--- 帖子 #109 ---
The thread stared 2 days ago. What reason do you have to deem it profitable?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I see what you mean. It does not matter much whther it is bbs or ssb. Ok, that is true.  Although, this idea of a three stoch might prove useful. however, the single currency directional play is still cheaper, but requires more thought to get the lot size correct.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I am trying it on Demo account. But struck at the loss of equivalent to the total spread. I am curious how do you guys make profit when the spreads for 3 pairs add together is quite sizable...

Any enlightened guys care to answer?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi,

If the ea is using check account profit as a global variable, then of course there would be no edge at all. Can you confirm that the ea is looking at total trade profit per individual group only, or looking at the figures for all trades in total, in which case it'll probably never book any profit. Pls see my previous post on this which explains it a bit better.

On the point of the stochastic, if as shown by Tex they are representing a point of "stretch" from where you "may" get into profit sooner rather than suffer a drawdown, then it would make sense to explore that as a point of initiating entry. There is probably no disadvantage in doing it that way, since if you open a trade randomly for the group, the stochs could be anywhere and remain that way for a period of time in any case. But if they add to your edge most of the time..........

Regards

Pardy,

I'll give it one more test and see how it goes.

Basically I am opening two baskets at the same time of the same pairs.

1. BBS

2. SSB

They are managed separately with their own Magic Numbers and their own Dollar Profit Targets.

I'll post back my statement after a while as this type of testing can take a long time.

I am also testing a different setting of my EA that uses the Stochastic OB/OS limits to decide when to open a BBS or a SSB basket.

Stochastic settings are as follows: Time Frame=M5, K%=100, D%=1, Slowing=1, OB=80, OS=20

I am using these settings as this thread was sort of born from Dreamliners Hedge and Correlation thread which uses these settings.

Basically if the Stochastic for GU and UCHF are < 20 and GCHF > 80 then BBS basket is opened.  Vice-versa for SSB basket.

I will also post my results for that, again after a while as explained above.

I will be using Comments to differentiate the baskets.

EDIT: I'm using Lot Size = 0.1 for each trade and the Dollar Profit Target for each basket is $10.

When the Dollar Profit Target is met it closes that basket then opens another basket of the same type and direction.

Rinse and repeat...

Cheers,

the-game.

P.S. If my EA has bugs, then that will further lengthen the result time.

Yesterday I had a bug where the profitable basket was to be closed for a $10+ profit, but the USDCHF buy trade did not close for some reason... and I'm still racking my brains to see why that is... after some coding to make sure the basket has closed properly, I'm crossing my fingers that it won't happen again on these tests!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Had another thought, this strategy of opening two baskets (BBS, SSB) and managing them properly could be profitable if opened before Frankfurt/London open, as both baskets have GBP and CHF.

As to how to manage them, is a different story as there is so much volatility during the opens.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
You're probably right, pair relationships change most in active market conditions, equally NY open could have similar impacts when the DOW and commodities markets are open.

Do hope your ea works well, be very interested in the results. Incidentally, a little while ago I put on the BBS pairs, which are neg by about 15 pips atm. Reversing that, I guess if I had put on the SSB, I would have booked profit of 15 pips, and then waited for the BBS to get to profit at some time.

I must try out that stoch indi on the charts and see what it shows. I wonder if it might somehow give a lead into single pair directional play as well. Much to learn!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
So the question is.....

Is there any smart coder to code such ea.. which will open BBS and SSB basket at time with magic number?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes there is one guy around  . Thats exactly what we need here.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
There is only one way to prove/disprove this strategy once and for all, do a backtest on Dukascopy's JTrader.  JTrader backtests in real tick data so the accuracy is as close as you get.

I have done this before but lost the code will do it again when I get time this week.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Other than coding new ea for 2 baskets with magic number, there is another way..

Existing ea can be modified for 6 pairs. So just find out perfectly correlated baskets.

ie if basket B1 is perfectly +ve correlated with basket B2 then open BBS (for B1) and BBS (for B2)

or

if basket B1 is perfectly -ve correlated with basket B2 then open BBS (for B1) and SSB (for B2)

Correctly if I am wrong!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
That is a totally different method of trading.

Okay, let me understand this post.

How did you get "approx 6100 units short u/c exposure with no gbp exposure whatsoever"?

I'm actually being serious when I say that I'm trying to understand

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I am sharing my results for last 20hrs. It closed 3 baskets

Lot size = 1.0

Profit target = $20

--- 帖子 #128 ---
buy 10000 gbp/usd =  long 10000 gbp/ short 16050 usd

sell 10000 gbp/chf =  short 10000 gbp/ long 15352 chf (16050 usd)

buy 10000 usd/chf = long 10000 usd/ short 9559 chf (10000 usd)

gbp: 10000 long and short cancels each other out. No exposure.

usd: 16050 short and 10000 long leaves 6050 short usd exposure

chf: 15352 long and 9559 short leaves 5793 long (which is approx 6050 long usd)

So we are left with appox 6050 short usd/5793 long chf (6050 in usd terms) which is about 6050 units of short usd/chf exposure. Everything is approximate cause rates were changing as I was typing.

So just place the short u/c trade and save yourself some spread and margin.

This chart shows the maximum profit and maximum draw down for a Sell Sell Buy.  The purple line is the current P/L.

The draw down would be profit for a Buy Buy Sell.

Either way, you can exit with a profit.

Patience is the key.

The results look good.  However, the $20.00 profit at 1 standard lot traded represents only a profit of 2 pips.  This may be the reason why the system appears to be profitable when in fact it is just the minor market inefficencies that we are exploiting.

See above answer.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I am sure you can figure that out.  Determine the entry price and direction for each pair.  Check against current price and calculate the profit loss.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Cash:

Check your PMs.  The email bounced back.

If you enter the pair, entry price and direction for each pair, the indicator shows the profit/loss, maximum P/L and maximum draw down.  It is not an entry trigger.

Cash, according to post #1, don't you start by entering and then reenter immediately after taking profit?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Normally yes, but it would be great to have an EA that would do it better than this one. It takes aleays a while until the trades are opened and both have no magic number, to handle their trades separately, when in profit.

It is your thread and you are correct. Posts have been deleted.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I was having similar thoughts after setting up the trades on last Sunday evening (06 Feb 11) in my demo account. Initially my losses were equal to my total spread on the three trades. Then the losses were little higher but then it was within a range of 4 - 18 pips loss (whenever I checked). Earlier this morning, I rationalised to myself that it will not be possible to make a profit on these trades due to the spreads and was going to close them after the New York open. Then hey presto! it went into a breakeven position and now a 28 pips profit. I herewith attach a screen shot of my demo account. Hope it helps with the discussion.

Obviously, there is some sort of market anomaly here or some other factor at play which is beyond my comprehension .

G'day to you all.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I hope this is a DEMO, cause you got 64$ profit and floating loss near

$300, let it float, cause it could take few month now before your account

is completely wiped out or you break even finally..

Unfortunately FOREX doesn't offer Free lunch special.

P.S

Not sure why you guys still beating up the dead horse..

Good luck

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Ah, great explanation... thank you for that. I will now try my tests with GU and GCHF using 0.1 lot and UCHF using 0.16 lot.

Using the Basket 3 Pairs indicator, the strategy still seems profitable.

I have the time and resources to waste and because I'm interested, I intend to let my tests run ahead so anyone can decide if this method is for them or not.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
My first basket closed today for a profit right before the close(NY) 22hrs later.

Just wondering this whole strategy is based on imbalances between the similar pairs. So by opening the 3 pairs(basket) we have a direct relationship that is very visual. And theoretically it should never go beyond the spread of the 3 pairs.

Andrew S. talks about this very thing as a strategy in his teachings but it is impossible to do the math constantly between 3 pairs. This is very ingenious by and letting the imbalance come to you so to speak.

If you open the trades when all markets are closed between 5 and 7 New York time the difference between the pairs should be accurate. But if you place your trades say during a news release you might have an imbalance against you therefore when it comes into balance after 5pm you will be forever out of balance(or a long time lol)....Therefor my inexperienced advice would be never open a basket during market hours?

I hope I am making sense to you all.....I welcome your comments....

You're welcome. The change to your trade sizes will do nothing but give you a complete hedge, give or take some units, and will never show a profit. Unless it's from the little exposure you'll have because you not using fractional units and you'll being paying spread and interest. No complete hedge like you will be doing is positive interest so if you let it run it will cost you everyday. At least it won't be a total waste of time cause you'll probably learn from it and gain some experience on how pair interact and are related. Simple things like when you divide the g/c rate by g/u rate you'll get the u/c rate. That's were it seems some people on this thread think they are taking advantage of an inefficiency but couldn't be farther from the truth but no one listens. Anyway, failing is a great way to learn. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I must say, I will be taking interest in your posts from now on.

I did experience that exact scenario.

Never thought you'd be able to turn me around that fast.

As for the Stochastic filter... the EA hasn't taken a trade yet, which isn't good enough for me, so I will stop posting in this thread if the EA hasn't taken a trade in over a week.

Hello the-game,

would you be kind enough to share your ea ? i would like to try it by myself.

Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Ok i'm astonished since i tried this on demo

i've opened small positions (0.2 lot) in

GBP/USD - sell

USD/CHF - sell

GBP/CHF - buy

it started out with about 10 pips in the negative (in Equity terms)

and right now it seems to be about 10 pips in the positive overall

Ok so my question is this If i had opened the same position in the opposite direction, which is

GBP/USD - buy

USD/CHF - buy

GBP/CHF - sell

Would it have gone in opposite directions? (the equity that is)

By keeping these positions open for a longer time, how much can it go to the positive and how much can it go to the negative ? I assume that at a certain point in time it will come back to 0 ? Like an oscillation on the upper side and then back down, always revolving around it's initial position. ... ??

How can a trade like this go wrong ? Would it be just a matter of time until it will come "your way"?

How do you determine in which direction you open your trade (first two pairs - Buy or Sell?) ?

And what criteria would you look for entering such a trade ?

As i understand you look for a profit of 100 EUR or USD for exit. What lot size does that require ?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Aye, i am trying this too at the moment. With manual entry and exit. Would be better if we had these two ea's coded we were talking about.

One for BBS and one for SSB, each with its own magic number so it can monitor the eq of its own basket. So they can close their baskets when they reached their TP and open a new one right away...

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Here is something amazing happened! I will not beleive this if I did not see...

I opened 3 pairs with lowest spread I have with IG markets as below:

EU, UJ and EJ as BBS. It started with 7pips loss due to the spread. After 24 hours there is a P/L of 30 pips on top of the spread...too bad...it is on the -ve side (-30pips). I am still keeping these trades to watch if they will come back to zero. If so, I think there is something beyond my comprehension too..

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hey guys,

here's a screen of the last two days of my SSB basket. The EA closes all the positions when tp is hit and opens a new basket right away.

I am up 104 Euros at the moment, just letting the EA do its thing..

I've got a BBS Basket on another account and its still in the red zone since i started it yesterday. We will see if it's coming back to BE or to the green zone in the future...

--- 帖子 #153 ---
TEX,

Could you share your ea for closing the trades? This is my problem, I cannot monitor my trades 24H, so it will be easy the ea close my trades at certain point.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I don't really have much time to spend on these, so the attached EA wasnt tested at all. Y'all test if interested, and let me know. The EA is rigid to the currency pairs in the starting post of the tread

The settings

"BBSorSSB": enter either "BBS" or "SSB". Buy,buy,sell....Sell,Sell, buy

lot:           enter lot size. 1.0 default

TD:           105 is default. change to what ever.(base currency)

SL:           -405 id default. use -10000000 if u dont want to use stop loss

MGCN        Magic number. 1 by default.

To test the two sides, you'll attach the ea to two different charts. It doesn't matter which chart u use. Set BBSorSSB on one to BBS and the other to SSB then use different magic numbers ..1 and 2 will do just fine. remember to adjust the SL accordingly.

Thats what I got for now. Let me know how it goes.

Joe

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi..Thanks for the EA...I have put it on test....can we have option for choosing currency pairs also...As I'm testing in demo account...I could test all sets of combination and see which one works better by giving different magic numbers to each sets...

EUR/CHF             CHF/JPY             EUR/JPY

GBP/CHF             CHF/JPY             GBP/JPY

USD/CHF             CHF/JPY             USD/JPY

EUR/GBP             GBP/CHF             EUR/CHF

EUR/USD             USD/CHF             EUR/CHF

Let me comment a little (and summarize)

In the first post of this thread, the poster thought this method is  risk free. After all, using 3 pairs we have perfectly hedged each  currency involved. However, maybe cash4u2 didnt realize, but this method  is NOT risk free if the lot size for all 3 positions are the same. As  previous posters lonestar and the-game have pointed out, if all 3 lot sizes are the same, the result is a net long or short position; basically we have just '(re)created' a pair with a very high spread!

lonestar's example calculation:

buy 10000 gbp/usd =  long 10000 gbp/ short 16050 usd

sell 10000 gbp/chf =  short 10000 gbp/ long 15352 chf (16050 usd)

buy 10000 usd/chf = long 10000 usd/ short 9559 chf (10000 usd)

gbp: 10000 long and short cancels each other out. No exposure.

usd: 16050 short and 10000 long leaves 6050 short usd exposure

chf: 15352 long and 9559 short leaves 5793 long (which is approx 6050 long usd)

I can think of 2 ways to remedy this.

First, the most obvious is just to resize your lots such that there is the same amount of long and short for each currency. This should be completely risk free, as the net movement for each currency is zero. However, then how would you profit? (read up more on triangular arbitrage if you're interested)

Now the second method makes more sense to me. We just have to resize each lot such that each lot makes the same amount of money per pip.

For example,

long 1.05 lots of gbp/usd: 1 pip = 1.05 usd

long 1 lot of usd/chf: 1 pip = 1.05 usd

short 1 lot of gbp/chf: 1 pip = 1.05 usd

There is still a net exposure (a net short of about 69850 usd, short of about 58630 chf, and long of 5000 gbp)

HOWEVER, the movement of each pair will be such that assuming perfect correlation, there will be only net movement of 1 pair.

(eg when gbp/usd moves up 1 pip, gbp/chf moves up 1 pip, usd/chf moves down 1 pip. Net movement is 1 pip up.)

We know that correlations between pairs fluctuate and change over time. We just need to wait until the correlation relationships among the 3 pairs involved change till we get a nice net profit and close the trade.

This seems to be how cash4u2 is making profit. If that is the case, I do not see any advantage of this strategy over traditional correlated pairs trading strategies. I am no expert in correlation trading and stat arb, so I could be horribly wrong.

This correlation aspect has been touched on by the-game and the other posters talking about the stoch EA.

As of now, looking into the mechanics of this strategy I am rather skeptical... Looking at cash4u2's posted profit results, he has about just as many winning trades as losing trades, with no clear stop loss. Maybe cash4u2 or someone else has something new to add?

I dont mean any offense, this method just seemed interesting and I thought I'd offer my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #159 ---
OK...I got profit with 3 pair hedging method using GBPUSDJPY pairs with BBS. But now I understand the mechanics of this 3 pair result. My total gain is nothing but 60% of the USDJPY short difference.

To verify this that I could have just shorted USDJPY instead of the above, I tested as following. I entered two sets of new trades- BBS and SSB on GBPUSDJPY pair. I added the 60% to GBPJPY...which is as below:

GBPUSD: 1.0

USDJPY: 1.6

GBPJPY: 1.0 (opposite)

My P/L is at the spread level in both the trades. which means the profit or the loss we are making is the result of 60% short in case of BBS and nothing more, at the expense of triple the spread. Brokers will love this....

Anyone has different way to make 'riskfree' profit from 3 pairs?

This is a really nice technique in terms of hedging. I am surprised that so few traders have heard of this kind of hedging. In stocks and options it's called "Pairs Trading" hedging, where one goes long on one stock and short on another. You kind of do this by having 2 currencies every time and some are "short" and some are "long". But not exactly.

Has anyone tried back testing this kind of strategy over a long time and lots of pairs / triples ?  That would be interesting.

NICE WORK !

--- 帖子 #162 ---
What is everyone's results? I find I only win when I go in one direction. example on a e/u/j when all pairs goes up I win with ssb and vise a versa on a bbs.

The balance between maybe still out with same size lots.

I've only taken 2 trades with this - I won my 1% on the account balance using a SSB on the GBPUSD / USDCHF / GBPCHF...  So I'm in on my second basket with that same pair - going again for my 1%...  First basket took a couple of days.

I'm using Steve's Trade Manager to manage the basket by comment: TPH (Three Pair Hedge)...

Dear cash4u2

I'd like to ask one thing, because I am testing this thing since last night and current I am in plus +40 ( pips ) means +400$ with 1.0 Lot. I did tried this ...

GBPUSD = Buy

USDCHF = Buy

GBPCHF = Sell

So if I would be done this way

GBPUSD = SELL

USDCHF = SELL

GBPCHF = BUY

At this moment I would be in minus -40 ( pips ) and -400$ with 1.0 Lot.

P.S. I am in floating plus at this moment..

So I would like to know how much it can go in minus maximum or plus ?

Maybe anyone tried  this and know the answer ? For example yesterday I was thinking the maximum it would be around +15 pips or -15 pips without spread.

But today I can see that I was wrong... I can see that it is in +40 pips now I don't know how much will it grow, but I will leave it and see what could be the maximum plus or minus. So if anyone knows the correct or around number please share. Thanks a lot.

BUY/SELL:

AUD.USD

EUR.USD

GBP.USD

OPTIONAL:

BUY/SELL (COUNTER TO ABOVE)

USD.CAD

or if you REALLY wanna be BRAVE and take a chance also trade following same direction as first 3 pairs:

EUR.AUD

EUR.CAD

EUR.CHF

trick is not hold for all day, 1-2 hours max AT CERTAIN TIME(S), back test it

hello my friend,thank you for sharing your very good idea, i have to tell you that

i am trying your idea on demo and i am up $1000 for just 4 days !!! it is a great

system with any hassel,keep going bro,thanks again.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Excellent persia...I booked 100pips as well, but it was only a demo

Which pairs you did this strategy on? what was your exit strategy?

Let the pips be with you.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
hello dear,i did BBS  on GBP/USD - UDS/CHF - GBP/CHF,i let them be on profit by

themselfs,no stop no target point as you know,i think this is one of the best

strategy i have ever seen on this market.

regards

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes persia, I did the same method, and hit my 100pips target, but I had a drawdown of almost 80pips!

I will use the EA: CloseTrades_After_Account_Profit_Reached, next time in order to close all orders when account profit is at +100pips.

It is a simple EA, and I tried to see if one can add an extra statement to close all trades if account loss is -100pips, so it would make it a simple 1:1 Risk/Reward ratio.

There is no AccountLoss statement in MT4...wonder if I can attach the similar EA to a seperate chart, but setting the AccountProfit to -100...for those coders out there, would this work, or any suggestion?

Many thanks!

Thanks sq.

So my thought was right - I can place negative # in AccountBalance statement for total account loss. I did update the EA code so I can have only one EA to close all trade if profit is 100pips or loss is -100.

Here is the code, and additional statements are in red...since I know you are the master coder, could you verify I am right...thanks!

@Persia:

How much floating minus pips did you ever experience before gaining your profit?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
That's correct.

However you must make sure that these values are consistent: don't set them to 0 for instance...

I would rather suggest something like this:

Inserted Code if ( ( My_Money_Profit_Target>0 && AccountProfit()>= My_Money_Profit_Target )
|| ( Open_Loss_To_CloseTrades<0 && AccountProfit()<= Open_Loss_To_CloseTrades) )

So you can use 0 to selectively disable tp or sl.

As Steve always says: everyone should learn mql4

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,

sorry that I was not here for a while, but I had some problems with my internet connection and had to wait for my new cable modem.

It's great to read that some people trying the three pairs hedging are happy with it, I am too ;-)

@josid

Could you change the code of the newHedgingEA.ex4, that it is also possible to enter the pairs manually, because it allows only to trade GBPUSD, USDCHF and GBPCHF.

I would also like to use it with other pairs and because I use FBS.com I need also suffix like GBPUSD.s and GBPUSD.u, hope you can handle that.

It would also be great to have a Moneymanagement, which allows to enter risk percentage of equity, and increases the lotsize automatically.

All the best

cash4u2

--- 帖子 #179 ---
The better question would be what was your lot size for each pair traded?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
The lot size is irrelevant in the big picture.

This strategy will work during the correlations ranging or if you are on the right side of the correlation IF you use a static lot size between the triangle.

Why? Because thats the nature of the beast in the market. It usually will range enough to give you profit OR if you are on the right side and the trend continues.

So does this mean you should save paying extra spread and work with the unfactored pair? Maybe not is my answer and it relates to the fact that in proper triangular arbitrage you are playing with market inefficiency.

The answer to that question is properly demonstrated by using a perfect hedge with the right lot ratio's. Once the hedge is in place you are net the spread/slippage until an inefficiency kicks in to make it better or worse.

Triangular arbritage tries to take advantage of this by opening a triangle during peaks and valleys of times when big money is pouring in. You can close when the the inefficiency moves in your favour. However you have to deal with slippage and brokers that will make your life miserable.

How do you overcome this? You can colocate your black box to somewhere near your liquidity clearing server and play on the interbank with more than $500k... thats really the only way... there is obviously alot of people already doing this which is the reason the market is so efficient.

The risk is that your triangle doesn't kick in with trades at the right time at the right price and you are left exposed more than the spread in which case you cannot determine your loss. This makes the strategy for general purpose traders like us unlimited loss and minimal gain.

You can backtest using JForex and find a proper money management scheme that may get you 10-15% per year but that's probably pushing it. The good thing is you can test as far back as you want... since your strategy doesn't change you should be able to figure out if your wasting your time or if consistent returns can be made over the long term.(10-15 years)

Jag

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Wasn't referring to that, I was referring to how much persia had risked in terms of lot size to get the $1K profit.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
hello dear,i did with one lot standard for each pair,again is a great system,i dont consider the whole subjects about the mm,correlation,spread,DD.... etc,just

trade the 3 pairs as directed and see the profit rolling into your account.

Interesting!

Then which pair would be a good idea to buy/sell, in order to get these trades an almost zero hedge, or is it possible?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Read the thread. It's not that long. I as well as several others have shown how this is nothing more than placing a single trade on a single pair. There is no method here. And making a perfect hedge will do nothing to help!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Well obviously, a perfect hedge is the same as not opening any position at all and an imperfect hedge is the same as a naked trade for the unhedged portion. Except, of course the hedging adds costs.

It's amazing that this thread is still going.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Agreed

I thought perhaps I could hedge it with selling eurusd, but this is what I got:

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi Lonestar,

Making a perfect hedge would be a different system altogether... and your enemy is now execution/fills rather than picking direction. I think they are just placing directional trades like you say but with confidence you can win I guess lol

Jag

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I have even done the math for people on this thread showing them that using three pair the way they are is absolutely no different than placing a trade on a single pair and whether they profit or loose is completely dependent on the movement of that single pair but some still seem to think they are taking advantage of some market inefficiency which is incorrect.

Making a perfect hedge isn't a different system altogether. It's simply not a system. It's paying spread to have zero exposure to market moves. Someone nailed it on the head earlier that most people don't understand exposure. Oh well, live and learn I guess. Although people seem to disregard that which they don't understand so the learning part goes out the window.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yes it is read my earlier post... you are near zero exposure but still doesn't mean you can't make profit... think about what happens when someone wants to do a big exchange of EUR's to USD's. The rings don't automatically balance out you know.. it takes supply on one and demand on another over a period of time for this to happen.

The bit about profit is dependent on execution... its a high risk low reward strategy that offers a very high hit rate if you get it right...

I'm surprised you never heard of triangular arbitrage?

I think you may have assumed that the market is 100% efficient.

Jag

Hi Oashken1,

hedging with profits? thats a myth.

there is a thread somewhere with hundreds of pages hedging the EURUSD USDCHF. after months and 1000s of posts they knew it was just trading EURCHF LOL!

here is my rule of thumb: "how many traders in the world are trading this? how many are starring at this?"

Well after skipping 98% of systems, You will find some HOLY price patterns!

.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
You mention near zero exposure can turn a profit. Of course it can cause there's exposure. But there is no reason to use three pairs to get exposure in one pair all the while paying extra spreads costs. The issue is that people do not understand where the profit or loss is coming from. And I have no idea why you are mentioning triangular arbitrage when it has nothing to do with what this "strategy" is doing. What people are doing here with three pairs is not arb. They are just creating a single pair trade synthetically, using three pairs, that's directional and paying extra spread. That's it. No arb. No market inefficiencies. Do the math. When they open these trades any profit will be from the movement of the synthetic pair and has absolutely nothing to do with inefficiencies or correlations changing or anything else. It's about exposure to a single pair. That's it. Apparently I can't say that enough but it's still not getting through. True arbitrage is completely different from what they are doing here. They may think it's arb but it's not. They have exposure. And with no exposure there can be no profit unless there is a inefficiency between the pricing of the pairs which is extremely rare and will not overcome the spread costs. Open a complete hedge, zero exposure, and see how many times you see a profit beyond spread costs.

Thanks lonestar for explanation...As a slow learner, I dig you

i think some peoples here are confusing every body with nonsense discussions

Hey Lonestar

I have to agree with you as I am "stuck" in a basket e/u/j for over a week as the market moved. My dd has remain about the same about 60pips. What makes this confusing is I cant say what direction a particular pair(s) has to go for me to TP out.

If you say we are just playing a pair with only with high spread then what pair is that? Say on G/Chf/U or E/U/J

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi bordercat,

here is a nice tick value indicator, just attach it to the charts of the pairs you want to use for trading and compare the tick value. On my broker the tick value for EURUSD = 1.0000 for USDJPY = 1.2218 and also for EURUSD = 1.2218. You see, the value of the EURUSD is about 22% lower than the other two pairs. So I would suggest to use other pairs with a lower tick value.

I only mentioned NEAR zero exposure because of the lot size constraints with most retail br0kers. Ofcourse any exposure will have you playing with a direction. But what I meant was that your assumption of "the closer you get to 0 exposure the less likely you can profit because of spread" is incorrect.

Fair is fair lets keep the discussion about this system which is not arb'ing.

Lets put it this way... those who are trying to match up lot sizes perfectly are trying to arb and this potential is negated by the spread and execution with retail brokers.

Those are are trying to use static lot sizes should read LoneStar's very nice explanation about finding what your exposure to know how to profit from your basket that may be "stuck".

You might assume its not possible but it really is if you have the right setup. (TheRumpledOne has some interesting thread called FPI). It really isn't about spread at all but its all about execution but may or may not be of interest to you because you really do need to invest alot of money to have this set up. Remember nothing is impossible.

Jag

--- 帖子 #203 ---
So it is as simple as lot size (eu)0.8 and (uj)1.0 and (ej)1.0? BTW I assume your 3rd pair in your example is ej and not eu?

Hi I remember the original FPI thread, 3 years ago. its a huge thread, but the outcome was the same.. not profitable.

You dont know how to put the TP and SL, its just the same with all hedging systems, sometimes price will NEVER come back.

so where is the edge here? its 3 years old.. have You had great success with it?

good catch....I never noticed that they were short usd twice. maybe as kent said I go down to the ferrari dealership today and put my deposit down..

So far after the tick-value ind on my charts. my lot size is much closer and I have renewed hope. Also if you get your BBS or SSB correct you can also get to you goal with the swaps if you get "stuck" also

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hey man,

What do you mean price will NEVER come back? There is NO SL and NO TP (you take profit when inefficiency comes in your favor) Do you understand the system? Once you're hedge is set price will ALWAYS be coming back and you are at 0 risk your margin used should be 0... you just have to make sure you choose times/rings that have overall positive expectancy by looking at spread/rollover/recent high to low pip span of  fractional price inefficiency.

I did not want to even bother with bucket shop Mt4 shops.. there is an EA and indicator available. I contacted a few banks and few brokers allowing me to trade through currenex, lava etc but the initial investment is too much. I can learn the API and program the strategy myself but the cost to get it up and running is too high even as even with demoing(playing with real money just less of it) you need a high upfront investment in margin.

Unless I have investors backing me or somehow or get myself to trade up to $500k somehow its not happening. Even then the strategy isn't proven until I actually do it and is testable on a stable platform. I don't consider Metatrader a stable platform.

Therein lies the edge... if execution is great and you find a ring that has a good spread offset by a positive swap etc etc then you have a no risk situation in terms of pips... your risk comes from the quality of execution and choosing when to trade (don't trade 100 lots between end of NY and start of NZ/AUS sessions for example, or when your ring has moved 90% of daily range already).

Any scalping system has to overcome two obstacles:

-coming up with an edge for a strategy (FPI already has this covered it is no risk)

-execution (difference between demo vs live)

The second one is probably the bigger hurdle.

Jag

Hi,

i cant find the thread after a quick search, there are too many FPI threads nowadays.

I did understand this perfectly, i was reading a lot of stuff about it.

the indicator goes from +1 to -1 or something. very easy, looks like a goldmine.

But in the end the conclusion in this thread was, that it doesnt work.. I cant remember exactly all the cons.. I just marked it as a " forget about it" system.

Maybe you find a way to handle it.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #211 ---
hi cash,

there is something called SPREAD, usually 2-3 spread for each pair.

how can you make sure that when you closing the trade, the balance of the 3 pairs are positive?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
what if you don't even see a positive balance, how u gonna close them?

has been 2 days already. since SPREAD exists.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
hehe yea that's what I thought when the bank said you can't demo to see if your strategy works and that we can't gaurantee fills of multiple instruments and the fact that you need atleast $500k.

But the cons are ONLY to do with execution nothing else.. if you get your triangle placed at the right spot and you don't have slippage on your close you will profit... alot of ifs revolving around execution nothing else.

Jag

--- 帖子 #214 ---
hi imnicetoyou, is this a really question? If yes, I do close the trades when the sum of these three pairs shows a profit. Not every single pair has to be in profit!

Any way, I do not understand, why some people select pairs with high spreads. On my broker EURCAD has 9 pip spread.

I use EURUSD (1 pip) USDCHF(2 pips) and EURCHF (2 pips) with my broker, this is a spread of 5 pips, if I would use your selection, all in all, I would have 12 pips spread.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Is there anybody who is able to code a complete new EA for the three pairs hedging?

This EA makes it possible to trade BBS and SSB on the same pairs.

That is what the EA should be able to do:

When the EA starts the very first time, it is allowed to open both directions, BBS and SSB, at once.

As soon as one option closes with a preset TP, it should not open the same trade again, until the still open trades have reached 50% of the TP we use.

Just to explain it better:

Let's say, we have a TP of 20 pips. In this case BBS has already closed with TP 20 and SSB is still open. Now the EA should wait until SSB has reached at least 50% of the TP before it opens BBS again. And vice versa. But you have to make sure, that the spread sum of the three pairs, must not be higher than the 50% of the TP. Otherwise you have to use a higher TP.

This makes it possible to use both BBS and SSB at the same time, without blowing the account.

The EA should also be able to use auto lotsize, where it is possible to select percentage of balance, equity or free margin.

This will be a great EA, as it will work like a bell, swinging from left to the right and always stays in profit, even when BBS and SSB will be opened at the same time.

An internal magic number would be great.

I was asking about the total balance of the 3 pairs. spread for EURUSD (3 pip) USDCHF(3 pips) and EURCHF (5 pips) with FOREX.com.

I still don't see a positive balance. how long does this usually take? and do you monitor them for a certain of time?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Sometimes trades are closing during an hour, sometimes it takes a couple of days. My longest so far was three days, before it closed with profit.

I always leave them open until they hit the profit target, I use no SL.

Good-day Cash4u,

Thank you for this hedging strategy and many thanks goes to everyone that has contributed.

I joined this forum because of this strategy you posted, because as far as my exposure and experience is concern, it is the best hedging strategy in forex so far because your mathematics is perfect.I have been on the search for a strategy without charts with high profitability.Those Charts are meant for traders to Loss their money.

It is highly profitable and zero loss potential if patience is applied. I am currently working on the loss potential and the risk management application.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
The only reason why this type of system works is that it is not true hedging

After all the banks would be doing it big time

True hedging would have to incorperate different lot sizes for each set of pairs because of the different daily ranges

Ie if daily range of £/usd is 160 points and E/$ is 120, if both went to the top of the daily ranges and we had bought £/$ and sold E/£ we would have 40 pips minus the spread in profit Although if we got it wrong we would be 40 points plus the spread in red assuming that the E/£ did not change

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Can't argue with that logic, but that was not my point. Anyway, my trend indicators say -

EUR-USD = Up

EUR-CHF = Up

USD-CHF = Down

so easy to spot which is out of sync, may present an opportunity today as they correct themselves?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
i totally agree with you,with patience and follow this simple rule you are always be in profit.

I hope you can develop this system to benefit condition.

I will post here something what can help you properly.

Sorry for my poor english.

This post comes from another forum, from another autor,

The autor of this post is great trader working as inerbank trader, I hope it can help samobody.

Hello, friends,

in this article I?ll invite you to discover the FPI - Fractional Product Inefficiency concept. I call the trading technique derived from this concept The Impeccable Hedge. In the text below, you will find out what is FPI, how do we calculate it and how do we trade it.

For starters, I?d like to ponder a littlebit about the quotes origin and purpose since that relates closely to the inefficiency of mutual quotes? products that form the FPI foundation.

General contemplation on quotes origin

From the dawn of civilization, people were exchanging goods and services among themselves to satisfy their needs. The principle of exchange is at the very core of any business. Indeed, we are making exchange-related decisions in our everyday lives.

The introduction of money changed nothing on the ubiquity of this exchange principle, since money is just a medium that facilitates the exchange in a smoother way. As we all know (or do we?  ), money itself has no value until we assign some value to it externally. In other words, money can only buy you things if your business counterpart believes the money possesses some value. Certainly you wouldn?t expect an unspotted native from the middle of an African forest to trade his 10 pounds of gold for your colored slips of paper (money). First you have to make him believe those slips are of some value (good luck on that quest  ).

Let?s now abandon the question of money being an intrinsically worthless medium of exchange and let?s focus on a thesis that is closely related to it: that no value is actually expressible without a comparison to some other value. This may not seem obvious, but until you express a value of object A in comparison to at least one other value, the object A?s value is uknown.

We may call this comparison a quote and it?s expressed:

either in a form of a product: A = 2 * B

or a fraction: B = A / 2

To better understand the mutual relationship between the values, let?s express some commonly used values as value / value fractions:

1 GOOG stock / 1 USD = 420.00

1 BMW 750i / 1 EUR = 87,500.00

1 hour of your work / 1 USD = 100.00

1 EUR / 1 USD = 1.2

1 GOOG stock / 1 hour of your work = 4.2

1 BMW 750i / 1 GOOG stock = 250

Every such fraction/quote defines the mutual relationship between the two values and based on various conditions, this quote changes. The key term here is ?mutual relationship?: if the Google stock quoted in USD goes down, it means the ratio of GOOG value to USD value is lower. It says absolutely nothing about the intrinsic value of GOOG or USD in relation to other values (like to the value of one hour of your work or to the value of one BMW 750i). In fact, maybe GOOG actually strenghtened after announcing a new revolutionary web service, but USD did strenghten even more after Bernanke said the Fed was gonna raise the interest rates to 10% the next week.

Unfortunately, there is no ?firm? value in the world to which other values (and thus, the quotes to them) could possibly be linked. This value uncertainity makes the world a perfect place for traders though

As we know, the Forex quotes are the ratios between the values of the first currency in the Forex symbol (the base or unit currency) and the second currency in the FX symbol (the quote or the price currency). There is no ?absolute? value of any of these currencies per se. For instance, the quote

EUR/USD = 1.2847

Denotes there?s a ratio of 1.2847 between the value of 1 EUR and the value of 1 USD. But we never can possibly find out what?s the value of ?EUR? nor ?USD? separately.

FPI ? a simple mathematical draft

Let?s make things simpler and let?s picture the Forex quotes as the plain mathematical fractions. Let?s have three Forex symbols, represented by commonplace fractions:

a / b = 2.5

b / c = 2

c / a = 0.2

Are we able to derive the values of a, b and c variables from these three expressions? No way. As stated above, the value can?t be expressed without a comparison to some other value. But we know what is the relation between the values though.

In this example, there are three fractions (FX symbols):

a / b

b / c

c / a

and three separate variables (currencies):

a

b

c

The quotes (the values of these fractions) in this example are not random. Actually, even though we don?t know the values of a, b and c, there is a mutual relationship between the above fractions. We can even derive the third fraction?s value from the first two:

a / b = 2.5

b / c = 2

c / a = ?

c / a = 1 / ((a / b) * (b / c))

c / a = 1 / (2.5 * 2)

c / a = 1 / 5

c / a = 0.2

A simple test reveals the product of the fractions? values is 1 and thus the results are ok:

(a / b) * (b / c) * (c / a) = 1

2.5 * 2 * 0.2 = 1

We can derive the value of any of the above three fractions if we know the value of the two others. We may generalize that in a set of n fractions where every individual variable is present exactly twice, we only need to know (n ? 1) fractions? values to derive the value of the last, unknown fraction. Obviously, this is true for any n, i.e. for any number of fractions where every individual variable is present exactly twice. We will call the set of fractions that feature the attribute of having every individual variable present exactly twice a ring since it resembles a closed ring of variables:

FX symbols: just fractions

Now this is going to be more interesting. Let?s subtitute the variables and fractions for FX currencies and symbols now:

Variables:

a = EUR

b = USD

c = CHF

Fractions:

a / b = EUR/USD

b / c = USD/CHF

c / a = CHF/EUR

Now wait! There?s no CHR/EUR symbol, only EUR/CHF! You?re right. We simply do:

CHF/EUR = 1 / (EUR/CHF)

I hope that I aroused your curiosity about what is the product of this ring (the three FX symbols? quotes). Is it 1 as in the example above with fractions?. Let?s see:

True prices as of Dec/29/2005, 17:00 EST

EUR/USD = 1.1840

USD/CHF = 1.3145

EUR/CHF = 1.5565

The product of the ring:

1.1840 (EUR/USD) * 1.3145 (USD/CHF) * (1 / 1.5565) (1 / (EUR/CHF)) = 0.999915194

Voila! It?s ?almost? one. Why it?s not exactly one we?ll soon discuss. But it?s clear the principle is the same as with the fractions above.

Complementarity

For sure, as was the case with the fractions above, we can derive the price of whichever of the quotes in ring if we know the other two:

EUR/USD = 1.1840

USD/CHF = 1.3145

EUR/CHF = ?

EUR/CHF = 1 / (1 / (EUR/USD) / (USD/CHF))

or better

EUR/CHF = EUR/USD * USD/CHF

EUR/CHF = 1.1840 * 1.3145

EUR/CHF = 1.5564

Bingo! We?ve just ?recreated? a price for EUR/CHF from the other two quotes. Again, our ?reverse engineering? came up with the price 1.5564 instead of 1.5565 and we?ll cover that later.

For a recap, the first ?1? in the equation

EUR/CHF = 1 / (1 / (EUR/USD) / (USD/CHF))

is there because there?s no CHF/EUR ( c/a ) quote on the market, only EUR/CHF, so we need to invert it this way. The second ?1? in the equation is there because the overall product of all the fractions (Forex quotes) equals 1. So we are simply dividing consecutively this overall product (1) by the rest of the fractions in ring to come up with the last ?missing? fraction (quote).

Remember, this rule applies to any number of fractions (quotes). If we had a set of 20 Forex quotes and every individual currency would be present exactly twice in that set (thus, they would form a ring), we would be able to devise the value of whichever of these 20 quotes based on the values of the rest of the quotes.

The fractional product almost never equals 1

Now you are probably asking what is so amazing about being able to tell the overall product of the Forex quotes (fractions) in ring is one?

Frankly, the amazing thing about this is that:

the product almost never is exactly 1.

Have a look at the product of the close prices on the following 15 min chart:

As you can see, the product oscillates around the ideal value of 1, but it rarely equals 1 sharp. This fact alone disproves the Efficient Market Hypothesis which maintains that the market prices are efficient and it's not possible to take advantage of market inefficiency on a regular basis.

Certainly, one of the factors contributing to the fact that the product is not exactly 1 constantly is that we are not using a mean value between Bid and Ask, but instead only a Bid price here. But that would account only for an absolute shift from the ideally effective product of 1, not for the wild oscillation we can see on the screenshot.

Now whatever is the reason for the value of the product to not being the ?correct? value of 1, this obvious inefficiency can be capitalized on. The value of the product oscillates moderately during the quiet market times, but the amplitude widens considerably during the times when the market is fast-moving:

It seems the market is not able to react fast enough on the changes in all FX symbols? quotes at once so that a minor inefficiencies like this occur. We may picture this concept simply as if EUR/USD quote was updated fast at one brokerage and slowly at some other brokerage. Evidently, when there are two different quotes for the same value / value ratio (EUR/USD), perfect arbitrage opportunities arise. That's exactly what's happening here: the ratios are simply not updated fast enough, so the trader can take advantage of this inefficiency.

And what?s astonishing, with FPI this inefficiency is present permanently! It means that at almost any time (except at the time when the product is exactly 1, which is a rare case), the market is inefficient in terms of mutual quotes between the FX symbols in ring! It seems like nobody had noticed this almost constant inefficiency yet, or at least I was not able to find any traces about any such idea on the internet.

The Impeccable Hedge

I guess you have already figured out that if we open a position in the direction of the ring, i.e.:

Buy EUR/USD

Buy USD/CHF

SellShort EUR/CHF

we are actually opening a hedge position since we neither gain nor lose anything. This is the Impeccable Hedge position ? the symbols make a perfect, closed ?hedge ring?. It?s similar to opening a standard, ?futile hedge? position:

Buy EUR/USD

SellShort EUR/USD

but we are including more than two FX symbols in the hedge en bloc.

Some brokers even allow for opening the same symbol positions in the opposite directions on the same account. The trouble is, there?s no difference between EUR/USD quote and EUR/USD quote on the same account (not surprisingly, eh?  ), so you gain nothing by opening the opposite direction positions with the same symbol (well, if you are arbitraging between two different brokers, the quote may be different). Actually, you lose the spread twice during such ?futile hedge? operation.

On the other hand, if you open the Impeccable Hedge position, you are getting the best of both worlds:

your overall market position is flat as with the ?futile hedge?. So you can turn off your computer, go on a vacation and sleep well.

as with the futile hedge, there are no stops nor profit targets, so your Impeccable Hedge position remains open until you close it and this fact does not have any impact on your account margin

you make money if you open the Impeccable Hedge position when the product is at one, say the lower extreme ( < 1 ) and close it when the product is at the opposite extreme ( > 1 ):

In fact, only the absolute difference between the opening FPI level and the closing FPI level matters. Open/close levels don't have to be below/above 1. The amount of profit made by opening and closing the Impeccable Hedge position is very small. Yet ? it is sure  ). Virtually, you can?t lose money by trading the Impeccable Hedge if you follow the above rules.

FPI relies on your broker not being a bandit

As we said above, the fractional product inefficiency is rather microscopic , so the success of using FPI in a real trading environment is much dependent on a fast and literally razor-sharp execution and low spread, because the FPI operates with market orders ?at the moment? ? we need to catch the inefficiency precisely when it happens. If your broker often plays games with your market orders, forget about FPI.

From the technical point of view, the Impeccable Hedge position opening and closing would be much easier if the broker supported a ?composite hedge order?: for instance, the FPI trading system would post the order to open three positions at once (buy EUR/USD, buy USD/CHF, sellShort EUR/CHF), but the positions would not be buffered into the market one after another ? instead the whole Impeccable Hedge ring (all the three positions) would either be placed or no position would be placed at all.

As of the time of this writing, I don?t know of any FX broker who would support this type of orders (please feel free to suggest such a broker). But anyway, if you are dealing thru a good broker (not that there are more than a few), you shouldn?t experience any troubles regarding market order execution.

FPI Control Panel for NeoTicker in C#.NET

I?ve written an application in C#.NET that hooks up to the NeoTicker trading platform chart and controls the FPI indicator externally. The FPI Control Panel application/indicator takes the symbols on the chart as the input, sifts them thru to get only valid FX symbols and sifts these symbols once more to get a list of unique FX symbols on chart. It means you can have EUR/USD, EUR/USD and MSFT on the chart and the FPI Control Panel will know there?s only one valid unique FX symbol (EUR/USD).

The FPI Control Panel uses my NeoEventsClass object class that generates events for the rest of the application. Event-driven programming is a modern and resources-efficient way of coding. NeoTicker doesn?t provide events in its NTIndicatorObjects library yet, so I decided to write my own events library based on NeoTicker objects and will use it until the events architecture will be available in Neo.

My entire code for FPI and all the supporting DLL libraries (including NeoEventsClass) is available for free here, so you are encouraged to use it and build upon it. You can download the projects source files at the bottom of this article. The FPI_source.zip archive also contains a set of precompiled DLLs and an indicator IDL file ready to be copied into the NeoTicker/indicator folder and run.

I have implemented only several NeoTicker events for the FPI Control Panel, but based on my events library, you can easily add literally hundreds of other useful events. If you do, please tell me and I?ll include them together with your name in the NeoEventsClass so that this effort will be sort of centralized.

The FPI Control Panel connected to the NeoTicker chart looks like this:

It displays:

the list of all symbols on the chart

the list of unique FX symbols on the chart

the detailed information about every unique currency on the chart (the FXCurrencies object that provides the information about all valid FX currencies in the world, their names (Canadian Dollar), alphanumeric codes (CAD) and ISO codes (124) is a part of my FX libraries available for free download below)

the list of FPI Rings available for this set of unique FX symbols. The list is calculated automatically upon clicking the ?Calculate FPI Rings? button:

Then if you click on one of the FPI Rings displayed in the listbox, the FPI value of that particular FPI Ring is displayed on the chart in NeoTicker as the FPI indicator (see above)

If you pick another FPI ring in the FPI Control Panel, the FPI indicator on the NeoTicker chart gets automatically recomputed. If the FX symbol is reversed in the ring, it?s displayed in parentheses:

not reversed: EUR/USD, we multiply by EUR/USD value

reversed: (EUR/USD), we multiply by 1 / (EUR/USD) value

Currency pairs matrix

I devised a simple and fast algorithm for calculating all the possible combinations of FPI rings given the particular set of unique FX symbols on chart. It uses a matrix of unique currencies on the chart. To better understand how this combinatorial matrix works, let?s show that on an example.

Let?s have 23 unique FX symbols on chart:

AUD/JPY, AUD/USD, CAD/JPY, CHF/JPY, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, EUR/SEK, EUR/USD, GBP/CHF, GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, NZD/JPY, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/DKK, USD/JPY, USD/MXN, USD/NOK, USD/SEK (for a screenshot, see above)

As you can see on the screenshot, there are only 12 unique currencies present in those 23 pairs:

AUD, CAD, CHF, DKK, EUR, GBP, JPY, MXN, NOK, NZD, SEK, USD:

The key to the matrix calculations is to ? well, work with the currencies in a matrix  The matrix abstraction is all done by the PairsMatrixClass within the C# FPI code, so you can assess by yourself how it works under the hood since I make that code available in its entirety below.

In a nutshell, we can picture this matrix by putting a ?1? (or ?true? in the actual C# code) in every row/column intersection for every valid FX symbol. As we said at the beginning of this article, the quotes are always two-way, so for the EUR/USD pair we put a ?1? at the intersection of EUR and USD as well as at the intersection of USD and EUR in the matrix:

By the same token, we fill up the rest of the valid FX symbols intersections for all above 23 FX symbols that feature 12 above unique currencies:

Notice the matrix is symmetric. It represents the currency intersections of all available FX symbols.

FPI Rings combinations

Now how do we come up with a set of valid rings with the help of the matrix?

I?m using a brute-force testing algorithm that goes thru all possible combinations of FX symbols. The total number of possible combinations we are testing is:

2 ^ n

where n is the number of total unique FX symbols that are available for testing. So, for instance, for 23 FX symbols, there are 2 ^ 23 possible combinations = 8 388 608 combinations total. By the matter of fact, converted to binary (see the C# code), the first combination will feature one FX symbol and the last combination will feature all FX symbols.

Now how do we assess the currently tested combination of FX symbols is a valid FPI ring? That?s simple. First of all, let?s recap what we?ve learned earlier in this article:

A ring of fractions is formed if we?ve got a set of fractions where every individual variable is present exactly twice.

In this definition, a variable is the FX currency and the fraction is the FX symbol. So this time, we will mark the corresponding intersections in the matrix as used in the tested ring. Let?s create a matrix for EUR/USD, USD/CHF and EUR/CHF ring:

Now we will check whether our chosen combination of FX symbols complies with the above rule. In the currency matrix, we do that simply by checking that in every row the total number of ?used in ring? currency pairs (FX symbols) is either 0 or exactly 2. Actually, we can check these sums in columns as well. That doesn?t really matter because ? as you remember ? the matrix is symmetric.

Zero occurences of the currency in a matrix row means this currency is not present in any FX symbol in the ring we are testing for validity as is the case for JPY, for example:

Two occurences mean the currency is present exactly twice which complies with the ring creation requirements, as is the case for EUR here:

Any other sum (i.e., not zero and not 2) means the whole tested ring is invalid. For example a matrix for EUR/USD, USD/CHF, EUR/CHF, USD/MXN FX symbols features this invalid row for USD:

If any row is found to be invalid during the testing, it?s unnecessary to test the following rows. We may skip this entire combination test and continue on to the next combination test because we know that all rows must be valid.

To declare the currently tested FPI ring as valid:

all rows must comply with the above rule (exactly zero or 2 pairs used in a ring)

the number of pairs used in ring must be higher than zero

the tested combination must not contain more than one valid FPI ring

In the combination testing algorithm, I am skipping all the combinations with less than three FX symbols since it?s obvious the minimum FX symbols count needed to create a valid FPI ring is three.

At the end of each ring combination test that yields a valid FPI ring we also need to determine in which direction the particular set of FX symbols will be used in the ring. Since the matrix is symmetric, it tells us nothing about the direction (buy or sell) of the FX symbols used in the ring. It only provides us with a set of currency pairs used in ring. As stated above, the FX symbols used in the opposite direction are shown in parenthesis in the FPI rings list on the FPI Control Panel:

In this case, GBP/JPY symbol is used in the opposite direction in the ring.

FPI: same time prices only

In the FPI Control Panel, you have to tell the program on which prices to base the FPI calculation. You have two choices:

open price

close price

Why there?s no high or low price to choose from? Simply because we never know when high or low occurred during the bar. Open and close prices are time-precise ? we always can tell that the open or close prices across the various FX symbols on chart did occur at the very same time. This is also the reason why it?s not possible to apply FPI to a tick chart. It?s only possible to calculate the FPI from prices that occurred at the same time.

There?s money waiting to be made with FPI

The FPI might be used:

directly for trading the FPI extremes (explained above), or

to predict the behavior of one of the FX symbols in ring

Concerning the latter usage, as we have learned above, we can determine the value of the missing fraction (FX symbol) in ring if we know all the rest of the fractions in ring. Let?s imagine we are analysing three FX symbols: EUR/USD, USD/CHF and EUR/CHF. Sure, if we know the prices of the first two, we may determine the price of the third one. But by the same token, if our analysis reveals us the direction of the first two symbols, then we can also tell what is the direction of the third one, too, despite of the fact that there might be no hint on the chart as to what is the direction of the third symbol.

Conclusion

As exaplained, the Impeccable Hedge takes advantage of the mutual inefficiencies of FX quotes. We can use the FPI indicator to display the current state of the mutual inefficiency. The Impeccable Hedge trade makes very small amount of profit, but this profit is sure. The success of this concept depends very much on the quality of your broker?s execution.

Thanks for your interest in FPI. I?m looking forward to your questions and comments!

Have a very nice day all,

Yes, persia, patience is the key. Some people here think, that three pairs hedging has to show quick results. It is not like that. Sometimes you get quick results, when the pairs move right in our favour after the trades are opened. But also sometimes, it takes a few days to see profit. If you want quick results, I am sorry, this is not for you!

Doesnt adjusting the lot size using the tick value indicator fix problem of just being in pair with high spread?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yes, it helps.

For Tick value of EURUSD = 1.0000, USDJPY = 1.2218 and EURJPY = 1.2218

Depending on the account balance, I then use e.g.  1.00 lot for USDJPY and EURJPY and 1.22 lots for EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hmm. Let's try that.

EURUSD@1.39720 +1 lot = [+100000EUR, -139720USD]

USDJPY@82.249 +1 lot = [+100000USD, -8224900JPY]

EURJPY@114.918-1 lot = [-100000EUR, +11491830JPY]

Net exposure = 0 EUR, -39720USD, +3266930JPY
Equivalent to -0.4 lots USDJPY

In this example Tick value of xxxUSD=1.0 & xxxJPY=1.2158

So, you use:

EURUSD@1.39720 +1.22 lot = [+122000EUR, -170458USD]

USDJPY@82.249 +1 lot = [+100000USD, -8224900JPY]

EURJPY@114.918-1 lot = [-100000EUR, +11491830JPY]

Net exposure = +22000 EUR, -70458USD, +3266930JPY
Equivalent to -0.4 lots USDJPY & +0.22 lots EURUSD

You've increased your exposure.

I do not know why you are always showing your complicated calculations.

You already mentioned that this is not working. So why do you keep on posting here over and over again?

But it seems that your smart calculations do not bring you any profits  either, otherwise you would not waste your time on this thread!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
His "smart" calculations are not trying to produce profits. He is trying to tell you what you are doing is trading 1 pair using 3. Google forex exposure and read up on it. No one is trying to bash your thread. If you feel this method is very profitable than use it. What he is pointing out is you are actually just trading USD/JPY, so what ever that pair does will mirror you profit or loss. And yes you can put on the trade and wait for it to come to profit at some point. But what if it doesnt? then what do you do?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
There is no gain in criticism.Before you can say a strategy is not profitable you must have used it for 1-3months.

Don't forget that it is better to trade without losses and to make10-20% monthly than to try to make 10-20% daily and end up blowing up your account.

I have used this strategy on an account with 10sets of 3pairs in the last 3 trading days and I am already profitable on 3sets. As I see each set go into losses I see it come back into profit,it is simply logical.

You can even manage you risk by edging each basket in case of CATASTROPHE IN THE MARKET.You simply BBS and SSB the basket.For example.

GBPUSD = Buy

USDCHF = Buy

GBPCHF = Sell

and

GBPUSD = Sell

USDCHF = Sell

GBPCHF = Buy

with same lot and have atleast 20-30% free margin.As you close each trade in profit you enter in same direction again to be on hedge.

The system is Profitable-You need Patience to enjoy it.I like it because I do less thinking and still in profit.Presently in profit on 2 basket.

Thank you.

You are correct. But don't waste your time trying to explain it to these people. I have tried til I was blue in face. Some people just don't listen and are too stubborn to learn. They'll just accuse you of not understanding even when the maths are right in front them.

This Math is correct, but Cash method also profitable, why?

if you only trade USDJPY, if lost you just have 1 opportunity pair bounce back, if use 3 pair,  if lost you have 3 opportunity pairs to bounce back, when 1 appear you can close profit the 2 others.

Still, to analyze bounce we need technical or fundamental.

Buy 1 lot EU

Buy 1.4 lot UJ

Sell 1 lot EJ

Since we buy in USD are not buying enough USD to match Euro....the difference the is the EU. If EU is trading at 1.5000 then we buy 1.5 lot of UJ and we buy 1.3 lot of UJ is EU is trading at 1.3000

Anyhow - I just manually added to the GBPCHF sell position to offset the basket and see if with my manual trading strategies I can gain some more...  I won on my first 2 basket trades...

Correct. That basket gives you a very small exposure and small risk. But having hedged out the risk you'll now find you've paid a large spread cost for a very tiny position. But hey, I've got no idea what these guys are trying to achieve. I'm just helping with the maths.

euclid,

Think of it like a rubber band.....you can stretch it in many ways but it always comes back to original  shape once you let go. Same here....open a basket and wait...news releases or whatever moves the market around. Say something happens that causes the "out of balance" to occur and it may only be for a minute or few seconds then the "close on profit EA" will close it out for you. If it goes against you well then you wait for a news release to send the rubber band stretching the other way or in your favour.

How many times have you watched huge moves in the yen or frank with intervention? Then the other currencies have to correct themselves....they do but meanwhile your stealing just 10-15pips of that inbalance. Meanwhile you're at work,school,sleep or play. I would prefer to open this basket up while all markets are closed so I know I have my "rubber band" relaxed or all prices are stable between each other.

I am not an expert I am just trying to share what I want to do and what I think this thread is all about.

Hello cash4u2

Well i have missed lot from this thread as i was busy in some personal work. If you remember i am who stated BBS and SSb strategy in this thread.

I want to know what modifications has been done afters? Is this strategy profitable?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
You mentioned the movement on the 3rd march.

Here is what I got with:

EURUSD sell

USDCHF sell

EURCHF buy

I'm intrigued why this is working. Just closed a profitable basket in my demo a/c. Common wisdom suggests we will make loss equivalent to the total spreads on three pairs.

Please look at the theory section of this link: http://codebase.mql4.com/6245 I think what we are doing is conceptually similar.

Thanks,

This works by creating a synthetic pair (gbpusd / usdchf).

If we open three trades (gbpchf - sell, gbpusd - buy, usdchf - buy) then we are hedging gbpchf with the synthetic pair (gbpusd / usdchf).

Imagine that you have opened a long position on a currency pair with one broker and a short position on the same pair with another broker (same lot sizes). The feeds from both brokers are different, hence although we are fully hedged there is a small window of opportunity where because of different feeds we can make a small profit by closing both the positions at the same time.

By creating the synthetic pair we are simulating two different feeds for the synthetic pair and the natural pair. I think this strategy will work best for very small profit targets and can be repeated multiple times during a trading session.

thanks

Ok I think I have the perfect hedge....1 unit of EU 1.4 unit of UJ and short 1 unit of EJ

Problem is Im stuck at -6 pips and -12 pips for over 24hrs....kinda think I will be there a long time. Its like buying AND selling 1 lot of eu at same time...big winner....broker. Before when I was "stuck" it would drop to over 40 pips down(30 over the spread) before it came back for a win.

Getting a sinking feeling that this wont work like our "math" friends have said and we are just shorting UJ with high spread. The fact its working for some people is the market is going in their favour...doesnt mean the system works.....

I will let it run for a bit and see if the "rubberband" effect might still work but I will limit my exposure.

It was fun investigating and I learned something and didnt lose any real dollars....about 5 bucks from a micro account.

after 8 days, I FINALLY see a positive profit on long EUR/USD, USD/CAD, and short EUR/CAD.  Maybe I should monitor it 2 hours after I open the position to see if profit exists in a short period of time?

is 8 days too slow to gain? medium term investment for sure gain.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi imnicetoyou,

sometimes, when we have opened the trades, the trend is going towards the negative direction and it takes a bit longer to turn into profit. But as you see, patience is the key for this kind of trading ;-)

Hello cash

I decided to give your method a try. I opened two baskets, both are BBS (GBP/USD/CHF) and (EUR/USD/JPY). I'm still waiting to cash them in.

I opened the first basket on March 7 at 9:18pm. Since then, I've never seen this basket even close to BE. Yesterday it droped around -60 pips and I was thinking not to close it, but did  BBS again. Today it came back to -15 pips (that's where you made profit).

It looks that if you guess correctly either do BBS or SSB you will be in + in 2 hours otherwise you have to be patient. In you statement in the first post I saw that one trade was held for 10 days. Thats why I'm sitting tight right waiting for the best moment to close it.

Hi Guys, I have EA for this system, Created By Awank

Profit$ = 10; //Close When Profit $10

Loss$ = -20; //Create Another Batch (averaging) when Loss -$20, if you dont want to averaging, set this number with huge number.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Mr. Cash, are there certain situations where we should do the SSB instead of BBS? Or it doesn't really matter and we can always do the BBS?  thanks

--- 帖子 #282 ---
this ea should have another feature if you trade a bbs after you profit and it close the trade it should open automaticly a ssb

--- 帖子 #283 ---
we need another feature to be able to adjust the lot size on each pair on eur/usd 1 lot on eur/chf 0.9

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Why??? Care to explain your reasoning for reversing it.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
the reason to reverse it is because actually in calculation it should go evenly but if it didnt move evenly and you profit about 20 pips  you need to do a opposite direction because eventually it will pull back is like a swing rubber band but if you go only 1 direction only bbs all the time it doesnt make sense in calculation that it will move all the time in profit

--- 帖子 #286 ---
What I have seen from Spieler's Hedge thread long time back is that, Std. deviation of the third pair (gbpchf when gbpusd, usdchf an gbpchf are used)   is used for direction finding, SSB or BBS. It could assist somewhat in choosing the initial direction. If Std. Dev is above 0.5 sell gbpchf and buy other two and vice versa.

Spieler's thread started with trading eurusd and usdchf with the help of eurchf  deviation and later on traded only eurchf..So all three pairs were not used.

SwingMan's indicator used for std. dev. is attached. I only hope that this will be of some use.

Hi everyone,

I don´t understand why people are surprised about the survival of this thread. As always, a thread survives if results are good and dies if results are bad.

I´m sure that, like lot of intelligent people said, in theory, all that system is just like a directional trade of one pair but, important is not theory in my opinion. A lot of system should work in theory and they really don´t work in real market so.......

I have started a test yesterday, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, SBB and BSS, at the same time. Each basket with different trade comment checked with MPTM, when a basket is closed, I open the same basket again, manually for now. MPTM closes a basket at a TP: 100.-$.

Results: +2,21% up, 10.000.-$ demo account, 24 h trading day, max DD: -300.-$, lot size: 1.0

Question: when a basket falls in DD, will it always recover? I don´t know, but a quick visual test with "Basket Profit 3 pairs SQ" says yes, max DD -1.200.-$.

What is important here is that your account must grow in a similar way that your DD, since you trade 2 opposite baskets, so margin must not be a problem.

I think it worth a try.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Much appreciated

--- 帖子 #289 ---
i think if you want to hedge double just put the this EA on 2 chart 1,BBS & the Other SSB.

I usulally use this EA only for grid trading to Eur/Chf, why? because with 3 pair when broker only allow to trade minimum 0.1 Lot, you can use smaller Lot just 0.02Lot. ([Buy EU,Buy UC] == Buy EC, agains the third pair Sell EC, will have smaller Lot of Sell EC)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi everyone... this is my first post in this thread.

I was testing almost samilar strategy few days before. I observed that trading with BBS and SSB basket simulteneously is very little profitable and it take too much time to recover. It works like pendulum of a clock where one basket profit is eaten by another. So I decided to little modify this strategy. Here is what i am testing manually but can be automated.

Multiple Hegding Strategy

1. Open BBS. (OR SSB baseket)

2. Book profit if pair moves in our favour and reopen existing basket after some time. say 60min

3. But if drawdown level increase, say (-$10) open another BBS basket (ie which is opened in step1)

4. Close any of above two baskets if TP target hits for single basket. Each basket should be tracked saperately by magic no.

4. If drawdown level futher increase above say (-$20). Open another BBS basket.

5.Close any of these baskets if TP target is hits.

6. And So on...

So we dont want to wait to recover first basket for longer time. Keep on booking profits with sub baskets. And also dont want to guess about BBS or SSB basket to open.

This can be traded well with EA. Any coder please help to code this hedging strategy.

Thank you very much for your kind words, oluwadare.

I am glad to read, that the number of happy people is growing on this thread.

Anyway, we need a better Expert Advisor than those we had already.

I told you that I have contacted two coders, to help to create an EA, with which it is possible to trade both directions, bbs and ssb on a single basket (three pairs). The problem is the first one does not answer and the second one wanted money to code it, but did not tell me how much he/she wanted to code it and pulled the coding offer back.

So if there is any coder watching this thread, here is al the information you need to code an EA for "Three Pairs hHedging":

It should trade 3 pairs:

e.g. EURUSD  - USDCHF - EURCHF  buy-buy-sell (BBS) or sell-sell-buy  (SSB)

(it should also be possible to enter other pairs and pairs with a suffix,  like EURUSD.u or EURUSDjfx should be no problem)

The EA should allow autolotsize or fixed lots, with selectable options,  percentage of account balance, equity or free margin.

EA should have a TP but needs no SL.

When the EA starts the first time trading, it is allowed to open BBS and  SSB at the same time, when BBS_SSB = true.

As soon as BBS or SSB closes by hitting the TP, it should not open the same

trade again, until the still open trades have reached e.g. 20 pips profit  => Restart = 20 pips.

Just to explain it better:

Let's say, we have a “TP = 40” pips and in this case BBS has already closed  with

TP 20 and SSB is still open. Now when “Restart = 20”, the EA should wait  until SSB has reached at least 20 pips profit, before it opens BBS again.

An internal magic number would be great, so that it can be used with other

pairs, without setting the magic number manually.

The EA should also have a selectable option, to activate or deactivate  it.

This means, when EA is deactivated, it does not open any trades, but it

should still be able to control opened trades by EA, until the TP  hits.

Thats how I would like to have the available options:

EA_activated = true or false
Orders = BBS or SSB  (This means if, “BBS_SSB = false”, then EA should only  trade BBS or SSB)

Pair1 = EURUSD (or EURUSD.u, EURUSDjfx, etc.)
Pair2 = USDCHF (or USDCHF.u, USDCHFjfx, etc.)
Pair3 = EURCHF (or EURCHF.u, EURCHFjfx, etc.)
BBS_SSB = true (which means, EA is allowed to open both directions on  start)

MM = true ( for Autolotsize)
Fixed_lot = 0.1 (fixed lotsize for all pairs when MM is set to false)
Risk_from = 1=Balance  2=FreeMargin  3=Equity (see Risk-type below)
Risk_type = 1 (this means Risk from Balance, see Risk_from above)
Risk = 10 (which means 10 % of account balance because Risk_type is  1)
TP = 40 (pips)
Restart = 20 (restart new trade when open still orders are 20 pips in  profit)
Tick_value = true (special calculation for different lotsizes, see  below)

Slippage = 3

The Tick_value is a special feature.  Attached File(s)   Tick-Value.mq4

1 KB
|
996 downloads

When Tick_value is attached to the single charts of EURUSD – USDCHF –  EURCHF, it will show the current tick value.

e.g.

EURUSD = 1.000 or  10.0000

USDCHF = 1.0802 or 10.8026

EURCHF = 1.0802 or 10.8026

As you can see, the tick value for USDCHF and EURCHF are the same and also  higher than the EURUSD

So, when Tick_value = true, the lots would be,  depending on account balance, 1.00 lots for USDCHF and EURCHF and 1.08 lots for  EURUSD

Or 0.10 lots for USDCHF and EURCHF and 0.11 lots for EURUSD

Or just another example:

EURUSD = 1.000 or 10.0000

USDJPY = 1.2152 or 12.1521

EURJPY = 1.2152 or 12.1521

Here the  lotsize for EUSUSD has to be about 22% (here 21,52%) higher.

So, lots would  be, depending on account balance, 1.00 lots for USDJPY and EURJPY and 1.22 lots  for EURUSD

Or 0.10 lots for  for USDJPY and EURJPY and 0.12 lots for  EURUSD

The Tick_value is always an about thing, and can not be used with  the exact amount, espacially on the lower lotsizes.

When Tick_value is  set to false, all three pairs should use the same lotsize.

The EA  also should show the following informations on the attached chart:

==========================
Broker:

Account number:

Account owner:

EA_activated = true/false

MM = true/false

Risk_from =  Balance/FreeMargin/Equity

Risk = 10
TP = 40

Restart = 20

the SSB pairs  like:'

EURUSD – SELL - Ordernumber

USDCHF – SELL -  Ordernumber

EURCHF – BUY – Ordernumber
Pips_SSB = Summary in pips of the SSB  pairs
Profit_SSB = Summary in currency of the SSB  pairs

And the BBS pairs like:

EURUSD – BUY -  Ordernumber

USDCHF – BUY - Ordernumber

EURCHF – SELL –  Ordernumber
Pips_BBS = Summary in pips of the BBS  pairs

Profit_BBS = Summary in currency of the BBS  pairs
===========================

I hope I explained it good enough.

Maybe it is even possible to integrate the Tick_value indicator directly  into the EA.

EA should be able to work:

on MT4 and MT5 (maybe we need two EAs then)

on 4 and 5 digits  accounts

with any suffix that some broker use

hello all, cash is better for you to use for eur / usd / jpy measures 1.22/1/1? profit because I got even with 1/1/1.

thanks for the reply ...

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Cash,

You dont want to balance out the tick value. The unbalanced value is what lets you take profit on the synthetic pair you created with the basket. If you balance out the tick values there would be no exposure and no exposure, no profit.

As an example look at the acct statement oluwadare posted few posts back. Now take a look the last 2 baskets on there. Both are creating a synthetic usd/jpy short trade. Now notice both baskets were open for around 2 days. Now pull up a chart for usd/jpy and notice how from the time the baskets were open, usd/jpy was in a slow uptrend. The basket cant profit.  Then on friday around 1600 usd/jpy dropped around 100 pips. So thats when the basket took profit because you are in reality, trading usd/jpy short. Now think about this, where would the basket be if it spiked up instead of down?

A few people earlier (lonestar,euclid) pointed out the maths on what you

are doing with these baskets. Im not saying that it cant be traded for profit, because maybe it can. But you guys should understand the math, and not think this is a no lose system.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
The Tick_value is only an option, to see what happens, when it is activated and is also usefull for further improvements.

--- 帖子 #297 ---

I wonder how big would be my DD at (point B), if I opened it at (point A).

Would other pairs ( EUR-USD, USD-JPY) would compensate so my DD wouldn't be bigger than 100 pips.

Thanks for any comments

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Nice explanation. But just one question. Approx. how much time that tick value remains same? I mean is it like correlation of pairs?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
OK, here is my comment..you posted the chart for eur/jpy, but you should be looking at usd/jpy, thats where you got your profit.

Since I can see you use oanda as your broker, do this little experiment..In one of your sub accounts (demo of course) that has no other active trades, put on a fictional bbs trade for e/u u/j e/j. once done go to top of screen and click the tab "exposure". What do you see? (hint:one will be nil, one short,one long).

Do the same thing for the pairs that are in your basket that is still running.

Once you know what your exposure to each currency is, you will then know what has to happen for the basket to profit.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Cash,

Normally for these cases, we can't back test, however do you have backtest or real live results for couple of weeks to see if the method really profitting?

I've been using hedging and correlation stratefy from by Dreamliner, been using that for couple of weeks, sometimes good and sometimes are bad, however if you stay on with the pairs with enough cash flow for sure there will be a turning point back to profits. This methood only uses positive correlated pairs with only 2 pairs. Only issue with this is you might have to wait 1hr-1 day  or 3 mths or more to see profits.

I'm not sure if your method would have similar impact as you are trading with 3 pairs.

Please let me know if theres any results.

Adious....

--- 帖子 #306 ---
This is actually one of the easier strategies to backtest. With tick data, it is a little challenging. But for regular MT4 timeframes, it is very easy to get a general idea of the basket performance. squalou posted an indicator for this purpose. I have not used his indicator (I used my own)...but I'm sure it is very well done.

There are multiple "flavors" of lot sizing this type of 3 pair hedging: equal lot sizes for each pair; weighted lot sizes based upon the quote currency; weighted lot sizes based upon tick value; etc. Backtesting gives a great feel for how the different lot sizing methods affect the basket performance and which pair is the dominant pair of the basket. You can also see the trouble spots (baskets in drawdown indefinitely) and why they occur.

Let me know if you have trouble with squalou's indicator and I'll post mine for you to try.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi.. is there anyway possible for you to attach yours and sq's and add the input comparison of yours to Sq's one.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Attach to any chart. Profit numbers deviate slightly from Squalou's indicator...I think we calculate profit a little differently.

Screenshot shows 3 variations of lot sizing.

Parameters

-------------------------------------------

Set "edtOpen" to your basket open time.

Set "estrPair", "edblLots", "edblSpreadPips", "estrDir" per your strategy.

To attach the indicator multiple times on the same chart...make sure "estrId" is a unique value.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Nice results! How are you deciding whether SSB or BBS is best? Or are you always just opening the same trades?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
system is good, sooner or later it musts bring some profits.

BUT there is one thing that comes to my mind - how to know if today I should play BBS or SSB ?  Let's say I have basket: EG, GU, EU .

5 days ago I opened BBS basket and SSB basket in the same time. The BBS basket gave me profit the same day, but for SSB profit I had to wait 5 days. It confirms that good choice (BBS or SSB) is the most important thing in this strategy. Of course I can shot like a moron and wait a week for profit with blocked money but wouldn't be great to close every basket every day ?

System bases on some deviations. When EG (from my above pairs) goes up to far while GU and EU stayed then it's good to open SSB and wait for compensation. How to recognize such deviation ? Any ideas ?

ciao

I don't know so much about the indicator. I have only tested it for one day. If You change Long Long Short to Short Short long you se if you get a green or red arrow. Its better to go in the code with the editor because if you change currency pairs from default in the indicator, you need to do it in 2 different place in the beginning of the code.

Hi All,

I'm just wondering on the three pair heding BBS or SSB, is there a possibility to look for a pairs that has positive swap rates, the reason for this is because i thought a way of trading not sure if it would work.

Here it goes:-

I'm currently trading

CHFJPY/EUCHF/EURJPY = BBS and swap rates for eurjpy is -1 while for eurusd is +2and chyjpy show =0 for this time. If i let run overtime without looking at the profit and let say based on your lots triggered and leaving it for 10days of trading, we can let the swaps to grow and hoping the swaps will cover all the BBS and end result for closure will be positive.

Try to digest this and let me know if it works... anyway to make it work with current strategy i need BBS or SSB pairs to either 2 of them to be positive swaprates.

Can anyone know if you have similar setups.

Adious...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
thank you Cash to share your strategy.

I read all the thread, some comments are positive, some negative... I thing the best way for each of us is to try this strategy before to write any comments.... and if some comments will be witten.... just to put some proofs of that. Something you did some mistakes and it is only when you shared the results that you find the mistake.

I decided to try this just because some of us put some positive results in this thread and the others that said : it is not good.. don't put any proof of that...

finally, with a demo... no need to expose somme fund to verify if the strategy is good or not...

question: when you choose a basket; do you take BBS or SSB for this basket or you take BBS and SSB

Hi Cash, I took the gu,gc,uc Basket I put the tick vakue on each chart

an I have gu = 1.000

uc = 1.085

gc = 1.085

Is it mean to adjust lot size and the same way of the tick value:

Lot 1,0 for gu, 1.085 for uc and 1.085 for gc??

thank

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi, if yoou want to use tick_value, you have to do it:

gu = 1.09 lots (rounded from 1.085)

uc = 1.00

gc = 1.00

Hi folks, is there any indicator for mt4 that calculate FPI and shows FPI extremes? I follow all the posts and I still do have problems with differentiating when and whether it should be SSB or BBS. I am testing the attached EA's and trying to understand the whole concept of it. Usage of mutual inefficiencies of FX quotes must be the simplest and least risky strategy. how do u find whether to trade BBS or SSB? is there anyone who trades manually? luck

thank for your answer.

Presently' i put 2 basket's on demo: 1° with egal lot size and the 2° with the " adjust lot size" all of them is.... winning...

it is better to try and to see than to put some negatice comments WITHOUT any proof...

Thank

A question:   how do you close your trades^  manually or you use the EA @ close trades after account profit reached... and if you use this EA can you tell me how do you do that^

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I love these comments about negative posts not including "proof". That is laughable!

There are at least 3 backtest indicators that clearly show the trouble spots of this strategy. The mathematics also clearly shows how a basket can get into drawdown for months/years.

Try the following basket at various times during the past 4 years. You will get into some serious drawdown (if not a blown account depending on your risk levels) on multiple occasions.

EURCHF (Buy)

EURUSD (Sell)

USDCHF (Sell)

I see the negative comments as very constructive criticism of a system that is just a little too simple to "guarantee" profits.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
You previously stated that you read the thread. You either didn't read it or didn't understand it. Proof was provided by me as well as others of what this "strategy" is really doing. I provided the math to prove it. This is nothing more than creating a synthetic pair through exposure differences of three pair. If that synthetic goes against you for the next month then you'll be sitting on a loss for a month. There is no secret here. It's just a directional trade while paying extra spread and sometimes more interest. The problem is that the concepts of exposure and synthetic pair creation is over the heads of most people in this thread and just because you all don't understand those concepts does not invalidate them and make this work. No one is saying this can't turn a profit. Only that is can take a loss just as easy. People here would be better off taking the time that they are testing this with and using that time instead to try to understand the aforementioned concepts. You'll probably view this post as negative, so be it. I have provided mathematical proof of what this is doing, and ignoring it because you don't understand it won't change the facts.

i tried this ea, great work.

who can modify, please change avaraging system become martiangle.

when 1st Batch (total 3 pair) = -20 pip, will make another Batch with open position 2x Lot of first Batch.

Exsample :

Batch I

Buy EUR/USD = 1 Lot

Buy USD/CHF = 1 Lot

Sell EUR/CHF  =1 Lot

Then total pip from Batch I ( 3 pair ) = -20 pip

will come through another Batch
Batch II

Buy EUR/USD = 2 Lot

Buy USD/CHF = 2 Lot

Sell EUR/CHF  =2 Lot

Then total pip from Batch II ( 3 pair ) = -20 pip

will come through another Batch
Batch III

Buy EUR/USD = 4 Lot

Buy USD/CHF = 4 Lot

Sell EUR/CHF  =4 Lot

Etc...

But..

If Batch III ( Total 3 pair) , reach= + 20 pip, All Batch ( Batch I, Batch II & Batch III will Close All , Certainly totally become Profit

my goal is not to insult anybody and I am sorry if i did that but when I said no proof I think about a backtesting to proof that or a print screen for the bad results... for the positive results I saw a print screen. Also I never said if this will be good in long term but if you take 1%/ day.... may be it is will a great strategy...

it is all.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I read most of the thread and found that many EAs have been posted here. But many of them have lacks.

Hedging strategy 4 pairs does only trade sometimes

New hedging EA doesn't have any settings regarding the currencies.

And so on.

So I thought, I'd just post the EA I found on my computer.

It works very good with the exception of the change between BBS and SSB. so maybe some programmer can modify the EA in a way, which enables it to change back and forth between BBS and SSB.

if you understand better than other people so why you are here and see all the comments to see what is going on,isnt better to save your time and do another thing on other trading system to give advice to others,if you are not interested just live this system.

Good-day,

If you can study those charts very well,you will discover that there is an invisible balancing in the market.I think it is better to test the strategy than to presume.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Good-day cash,

Please how did u do the calculation above.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hello oluwadare,
the Tick_value is a special feature. Tick-Value.mq4

When Tick_value is attached to the single charts of e.g. EURUSD – USDCHF –  EURCHF, it will show the current tick value.

e.g.

EURUSD = 1.000 or  10.0000

USDCHF = 1.0802 or 10.8026

EURCHF = 1.0802 or 10.8026

As you can see, the tick value for USDCHF and EURCHF are the same and also  higher than the EURUSD

So, when Tick_value = true, the lots would be,  depending on account  balance, 1.00 lots for USDCHF and EURCHF and 1.08 lots for  EURUSD

Or 0.10 lots for USDCHF and EURCHF and 0.11 lots for EURUSD

Or just another example:

EURUSD = 1.000 or 10.0000

USDJPY = 1.2152 or 12.1521

EURJPY = 1.2152 or 12.1521

Here the  lotsize for EUSUSD has to be about 22% (here 21,52%) higher.

So, lots would  be, depending on account balance, 1.00 lots for USDJPY and EURJPY and 1.22 lots  for EURUSD

Or 0.10 lots for  for USDJPY and EURJPY and 0.12 lots for  EURUSD

The Tick_value is always an about thing, and can not be used with  the exact amount, especially on the lower lotsizes.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I found this in my toolbox. Put the indicator on one chart. It shows tick value and ATR. You can have up to 14 pairs. If you want to se only 3 currency pairs, put them on top as the 3 first one and change NumPairs to 3

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Your absolutely right. You don't get it. The proof has been provided several times. Try to understand it because you, and others, clearly don't. And I am not the only one saying this. I am posting here to help people understand better but that's proving futile because people either don't want to understand or can't. Since this thread is still going on, I vote for the latter. I just don't want people to think this is some kind of risk free arb as some have said because its not. It's just a difficult and costly way to place a single directional trade. But if you and the others want to trade with your head in the sand, have at it, waste your time and money. Bye.

Listen to the man, he knows what he is talking about. Think about it for a minute. Putting on a basket and thinking, as I have seen stated, that "eventually" it will come into profit is dangerous and reckless thinking. And now the posts of doubling up if it doesnt go your way, is even worse.

Try to understand what lonestar said about a synthetic pair. That is what this strategy is doing. Now if you can figure out what synthetic pair you have created, pull up the chart for that pair and your basket profit/loss will coincide with what that pair is doing.

For example a basket of BBS for eur/usd-usd/jpy-eur/jpy creates a usd/jpy short trade. So if usd/jpy drops in price, your basket can profit.   Now since that pair has been trending down last few days, if you had a bbs you probably closed in profit. But what if you had SSB in same basket? you would be in drawdown, hoping it comes back.

With some common sense, understanding of what you are actually doing, and risk management this strategy probably can be traded well, just like any other.

For the poster asking to see a print screen of proof, well we have seen print screen of closed trades in profit. I would also like to see those same posters show their open baskets and any drawdown associated with it. Print screens of closed trades is like looking at an iceberg, if you get my drift.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
try to understand!!!!! what is your point,again $1800 total profit since 2/18/2011 until now is not enough for you guys to see the profit  in a simple

way.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
After a week I started seeing some profit on my GBP/USD/CHF basket.

Yesterday It was + $60, today +700. Right now it's floating around $500.

I decided not to close it, as I want to run it for a while, and observe what the biggest DD and profit it can reach.

During past week I saw DD -$800 (80 pips) and profit $770 ( 70 pips).

At the point when my BBS basket rich max. DD, than it went the opposite, all the way to the $700 profit. Now let say that at the max DD, I opened SSB basket. It means that right now I would be down around $1500.

IMO it's not a good idea to double your lot size after every 20 pips loss.

That's why I would like to know what is the biggest DD, I should expect...??

=================================

For complete My idea, here attached in excel, please who can make EA

--- 帖子 #338 ---
are we 3 pairs hedged by opening 3 trades the same size each (f.ex. 1 lot each)? example (not taking ask/bid into consideration):

eurusd = 1,3976 (long eur, short usd)

eurgbp = 0,8686 (short eur, long gbp)

gbpusd = 1,6095 (short gbp, long usd)

first trade: long eurusd = 100,000 eur equals 139760 usd

second trade: short eurgbp = 100,000eur equals 86860 gbp

third trade: short gbpusd = 100,000 gbp equals 160950 usd

It seems we are not hedged !! shouldn't we buy and sell eur, gbp and usd equally?

third trade: short gbpusd = 86,860 gpb equals 139760 usd

eurusd 1 lot, eurgbp 1 lot and gbpusd 0,86 lot (size of the third trade is determined by the current gbpusd exchange rate)

please advise if I make any mistakes

--- 帖子 #339 ---
You are right. Look at the  profit chart of BBS Basket gbpusd, usdchf and gbpchf. It is inverse of usdchf. In effect when usdchf moves down BBS makes profit and vice versa. Either you can trade basket or single pair.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
in my opinion:

gu - 1 lot

uc - 1,6 lot

gc - 1 lot

hello fellow trader,i just booked another $485 for one week,listen dont bother yourself with any indicator or whatsoever that you can peredict the direction of pairs,just follow the post #1 and you gonna be on profit soon or later,god bless you cash.

Hi Persia,

Good see you are doing well with this strategy. Could you please advise me if you are using any indicator. How do close the trade when it is in profit?Do monitor the trade manually to close when in profit.

Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
good to hear that you are doing good. My BBS basket (GBP/USD/CHF) is doing well. As now I am up $1600 (160pips).

But there is one thing which scares me a lot. If I opened SSB basket on the same cross I would be down $2400 (240pips).

I wonder for how long it can run in only one direction...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I enjoyed that ride too.It is better you take profit now. If you open SSB and you are in loss position, the market will re-adjust itself in less than 5 trading days from now and you will be in profit. Patience is the key.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I want to keep this basket running to see how my profit changes in loss and vice versa. This way I know where I am in the market.

Meanwhile I opened SSB basket for the same pairs, when I was +$200 on my BBS, hoping it will reverse. So on this one I am -$1300 (130pips) down.

I saw my profit changing from $1200 to $850 and this would be the best moment to open SSB and grab $100 (10pips), but it's hard to predict.

What I'm trying to do is find the way to choose the basket which will give me profit in couple hours, so I don't have to deal with big DD.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hi, i dont use any indi and any ea and i watch the pairs manually

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thanks..I forgot about that indicator.

Thats correct. That baskets creates short exposure to usd/chf so your PL will mirror whatever usd/chf does. I think your chart proves that very clearly. So now that you understand that, can you see how it would be dangerous to just throw on a basket and hope. What happens if you had SSB on that basket. How much DD would you have and if trading real $ would you be able to stomach the DD. Yea it may turn around and go your way but what if it doesnt. You would have to get out at some point. So trading this system or any system without some kind of risk management is just long term suicide. Sooner or later one of the baskets will go against you and those 1800.00 in profits will vaporize..quickly.

Again, not saying the system is bad or cant be traded well, just understand the risks involved.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Great to see good results of using this system.

Could you say more about your trades??

Do all your trades get benefit?? or maybe some you have finished without profit??

How long you had to wait to obtain profit??

Haw many trades you made to obtain this result: 1778$ ??

Hi All,

I've been enjoying this system and i guess after all profitable weeks, the time has reached where gbpchf is making a turning point and it in a major draw down now.

I'm thinking if it would return negative.

GBPUSD = Buy

USDCHF = Buy

GBPCHF = Sell

--- 帖子 #350 ---
9 ppl out of 10 using this sys and making huge profits DO NOT understand why.

however, there is no doubt, in future, 9 ppl out of 10 using this sys and making huge loss start to understand why.

visiting this thread is pretty entertaining.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Yeah, I spoke to soon, somehow my major drawdown was -400pips now came back to -50pips... its rotating on me alright..

maybe i've reach the day to condemn this strategy. but for now i don't mind loosing one or 2 trades cause i in opposite i have winning 10 trades + - = positive.

i have not tried other pairs that is not working profitably as it only averaging in general and i had to close them and just loose on the spreads except for gbpusd, usdchf and gbpchf.

Does anyone tried other pairs and if its working?

--- 帖子 #352 ---

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Persia,

I will cut you some slack because by your comments, you seem like a new and  inexperienced trader. Your comment above about "upper" people shows this. No one is trying to be upper than anyone else. Every system in forex has risks and drawbacks. Some of the kinder people here are only trying to show what those are. You would be wise to listen. A few weeks of good profits on demo mean nothing. A few bad trades and those wonderful profits will be gone. Being "positive" in forex wont make you money, being informed might.

Re-read the post by Charvo a few before this one. If you dont understand how the basket makes a profit, then you wont understand when it loses.

"If you open SSB and you are in loss position, the market will re-adjust itself in less than 5 trading days from now and you will be in profit. Patience is the key. "

This was the best quote Ive seen on this thread, well maybe not the best but it sure made me laugh. Now that I know trends are on a 5 day schedule I should be rich soon.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
are you completely sure ? let's assume that one day market is ideally synchronized (let's call it zero level), you open SSB, the day later market unsynchronized in your direction (let's call it "minus direction"), you take profit and next what market is going to do is synchronize back to zero level (this strategy assumes so). But before market synchronized some other trader opens his platform and decided to open SSB basket but the market is at "minus level" and trader does not know that.  What happens ? Next days market is synchronizing in zero level direction (means losses for our trader), another next days it is unsynchronizing in "plus" direction so our trader waits and waits with bigger losses, after week market synchronizes back and goes in minus direction, our trader (if realized that he played at bad moment) may close trade without loss, but is he able to take profit ? I don't think so (be aware of swap).

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hope you observed that all negatives are now positive. The truth I have discovered about this strategy is that the market will always correct itself for you to be in profit. Also, risk management is very important to be successful trading the system. My greatest amazement is that, even on my special hedging strategy which is more like this one, I am also profitable.

Here you see three still open baskets (one from 8th march) and the margin level went down to 82%.

After that it started to recover and is up now at 181.13% (real money)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So do not open to many baskets.

I use the EA from post www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4402134

But that is not a good one, because it sometimes opens orders and closes them right afterwards, before the complete basket has been opened at all.

I use a TP of 150 pips right now.

Here is also a screenshot from another broker (demo)

when USDCHF is moving up buy only SSB basket when it is coming down BBS.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Here is what I tried last month and I hope this post is still useful to understand the mechanics of this trend and the few days live test I did, which is nothing but trading a single pair.

---------------------------------------------------------------

OK...I got profit with 3 pair hedging method using GBPUSDJPY pairs with BBS. But now I understand the mechanics of this 3 pair result. My total gain is nothing but 60% of the USDJPY short difference.

To verify this that I could have just shorted USDJPY instead of the above, I tested as following. I entered two sets of new trades- BBS and SSB on GBPUSDJPY pair. I added the 60% to GBPJPY...which is as below:

GBPUSD: 1.0

USDJPY: 1.6

GBPJPY: 1.0 (opposite)

My P/L is at the spread level in both the trades. which means the profit or the loss we are making is the result of 60% short in case of BBS and nothing more, at the expense of triple the spread. Brokers will love this....

-------------------------------------------------------------

I still dont understand this method. After 25 pages on this thread, I start wondering if I did not understand something or may be I am too naive to be open minded to this 'new riskfree idea'?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
You are absolutely right, but people still percieve some risk free profit in this kind of trading, probaly because they see no need to study the trend and all that as with a single pair and enter whenever they like and in whatever direction. One can do that with single pair too.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
keep running this, you will wipe out your account in a few months.

this comment is as hard as iron.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
If you want to use the same tick value for the single pairs, you should use:

GBPUSD = 1.23

USDJPY = 1.00

GBPJPY = 1.00

To use Tick_value is even better, because, we go for pips and not for a special amount of account currency in profit.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Therefore it should be used a sensible MM and a certain amount of baskets. Bad MM and too many baskets will certainly blow any account.

I wanted to use only two baskets for my real money account, but I forgot to disable the EA for the third basket.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Well, I wrote this EA. the ea closes the basket when it tries to open and theres a re-quote on some of the legs. For eg. 2 legs opened out of three. and the third one keeps requoting.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Good-day All,

In Face of Market Turbulent this strategy still worked:

This is how it happened:

1. I diversified my portfolio- Instead of Trading 1lot for 3 pairs(1basket) on 10k account, I traded 0.1 for 3pairs on 10baskets with target profit of $10+.Sound money management is important. You make profit on each of the 10basket 3-5times in a month.

2.Secondly I now discovered how to trade the strategy better. Just Trade currency pairs with the first two pairs highly negatively correlated, and the third pair oscillate in-between them to make you profitable.

eg.

EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF; AUDUSD,GBPAUD,GBPUSD;GBPUSD,USDCHF,GBPCHF;USDCAD,CADCHF,USDCHF

etc.

Just study more on Highly Negative Correlated Pairs.

Good-day,

cash4u

It is not just jpy issue, it is the market situation. I have discovered the adequate rules for entring into any trade on any basket. There are 8 rules I will share it in my next post.

I gues your trade would have GU/UJ/GY the reason why u still have a loss is because the uj and gy are correlated upwards and gu has been stagnant going up and down with no direction. if gu goes up and gy and uj remain stagnant or come down a little you will be in profit.

Note:

It is either gu and uj are highly positive correlated or highly negative correlated for you to be in profit always trading that basket. My correlation table tells me that they are low correlated pairs. It is not save to trade that basket.

I just checked my 20 baskets that gave me 3% two trading days ago , I noticed there is no uj because it is a low correlated pair.

Shaw there are many brokers that allows that eg, broco, trading point or go to this link:http://www.100forexbrokers.com/nfa-r...-forex-brokers or www.earnforex.com

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
waiting for yr 8 rules

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Looking forward to 8 rules.. Your method you described in corelation strtegy is good and working for me.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Good-day All,

I discovered all these by deep and simplified thinking.

First and foremost you need to understand Negative and Positive correlated pairs concept.

Study more on that on the links below:
http://www.babypips.com/school/what-...rrelation.html
http://www.babypips.com/school/how-t...on-tables.html
http://www.babypips.com/school/alway...-exposure.html
http://www.babypips.com/school/how-t...r-trading.html
http://www.babypips.com/school/know-...ns-change.html

The Basic concept of currency correlation goes Thus:

1. When a base currency or a counter currency in a particular pair is the base currency or the counter currency in another pair respectively, be sure that both pairs will be POSITIVELY CORRELATED. Eg. EURUSD,GBPUSD; USDJPY,USDCHF etc.

2. When a currency is a base currency in a particular pair and it is the counter currency in another pair, be sure that both pairs will be NEGATIVELY CORRELATED.eg. AUDUSD,GBPAUD;CADJPY,GBPCAD etc.

Note: Use The Stochastic Paired Difference indicator to confirm if the paires are highly Highly Positively or Negatively Correlated: Attached File(s)   Stochastic different pairs 1.1.mq4

3 KB
|
1,941 downloads

If Positively correlated, the two pairs goes the same direction.

If Negatively correlated, the two pairs goes the opposite direction.

THE 8 RULES OR PROBABILITIES FOR PROFIT ON THREE PAIRS HEDGING:

Let us use Basket: EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF - Note that the first two Pairs are negatively correlated pairs in theory.

A. The three pairs correlates positively or move in same direction:

1.BUY BUY SELL= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = DOWN DOWN DOWN

2.SELL SELL BUY= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = UP UP UP

B.The first two pairs are negatively correlated, then the last pair correlates positively with any of the first two pairs.

3.BUY BUY SELL= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = UP DOWN DOWN

4.BUY BUY SELL= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = UP DOWN UP

5.SELL SELL BUY= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = DOWN UP UP

6.SELL SELL BUY= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = DOWN UP DOWN

C.The first two pairs are positively correlated and the last pair is negatively correlated to the first two pairs.

7.BUY BUY SELL= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = UP UP DOWN

8.SELL SELL BUY= EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF = DOWN DOWN UP

SUMMARY:

1.When the 3pairs are highly correlated downwards, you BUY BUY SELL.

2.When the 3pairs are highly correlated upward, you SELL SELL BUY.

3.When the first pair is upward and any of the other two pairs is highly negatively correlated to it(or downward), you BUY BUY SELL.

4.When the first pair is downwards and any of the other two pairs is highly negatively correlated to it(or upward), you SELL SELL BUY.

Please make a set up of positive and negative correlated pairs on your platform using the stochastic paired difference indicator and back-test to confirm and understand the explanation above.

I Recommend that the safest entry is when the first two pairs are highly negatively correlated, so that when there is a turn in the market you still go profitable on time.For example on  EURUSD,USDCHF,EURCHF; Enter at the Point where EURUSD is negatively correlated to USDCHF.

The changes in the correlation movement of pairs is what makes us profitable with time without being trapped in the market with permanent losses.

Successful Trading,

Oluwadare

I've got an off-topic question to your post

how do you set up your mobile android oanda application, that it shows profit/loss in $ for each single position open (mine shows this only in pips). For this 3 pairs strategy it;s vital to have each position profit/loss shown in $, not in pips

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Oluwadare,

I'm not quite sure how does this indicator work in MT4, i clicked, nothing happened.

Stochastic Paired Difference indicator

I put it under   MetaTrader 4expertsscripts

is that correct?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
The problem here as I see it, is that one never knows when the correlation (parity) will be broken, nor to what extent (magnitude) it will be broken.  Thus, if my strategy relies upon +correlation and both pairs diverge from parity, then one could drive-up their losses.  The inverse is true for -correlation.  If both pairs reverse polarity, the draw accelerates rapidly.

Currency Options can provide the kind of Non-Directional trading opportunities that seem to be sought here - where you can then apply good options strategies on a single pair with Puts and Calls.

Otherwise, not knowing when correlation is about to change, makes the risk factor just as normalized as trading a single pair naked in the market.  If correlations were always fixed, then the above would not apply - but that is not the case among the major pairs in FX.  Of course, the other issue when attempting this quasi-non-directional strategy, is to make sure that your pairs have small deltas between their respective spreads.  Too high a spread delta (Pip Cost Delta) and your losers can outweigh your winners while not leaving enough room to off-set such effects with variable lot sizing strategies.

But, I'm just one man whistling in the dark here.

Hi Oluwadare, Hi Cash4u2, Hi Alls

I'm very happy to join this thread .

I entirely agree with you: if you want a "true" hedge with the schemes BBS and SSB you MUST use only HIGHLY (more than 80%) NEGATIVE correlated pairs, otherwise you get a normal directional trade with 3 spreads. If you want use positive correlated pairs you must change the schemes as SBB or BSS.

I have a question for you: which EA you use for trade multiple hedgings on one account calculating each one the single profit (not the overall profit of the account of course), the EAs posted here are not useful for this.

Thanks All

I trade it manually and the system is still profitable till date. I trade only 60% of my account double hedging.

eg on a 10k account I trade 1lot each.

BBS: EURUSD, USDCHF, EURCHF and SSB : EURUSD, USDCHF, EURCHF making 6k or 6lots at the same time. I take profit continuously in the market in either direction.

Successful Trading

Thanks Oluwadare,

so you trade the EU UC EC BBS and SSB in the meantime in the same account with a small take profit of 10 pips MANUALLY...sounds a little bit hard, with an EA should be more easy I think.

The Stochastic multipair is a good indicator but a bit messy, I think the Basket Profit 2 Pairs of Squalou is much more clear, I noticed that exist also a version of Basket Profit 3 Pairs, that could be very usefull for monitoring the EU UC EC hedge, but I can't find it, maybe someone can help.

Good Easter to everybody

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Oluwadare,

Would be kind enough to post some pictures of the charts that show your setup and the BBS / SSB trades so that we can see it?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Simihouse, can you explain me how you use Basket Profit 2 Pairs indicator for BBS/SSB entries?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Altoronto,

if you trade EU UC and EC in the two ways BBS and SSB actually you get a perfect hedge, so you don't need any indicator (this is the best feature of this system); the Basket Profit 2 pairs is not usefull at all for this strategy. But the Basket Profit 3 pairs can be usefull ONLY for monitor the trades and have some backtest. What could be very useful is an EA that can open the two hedges and close the hedges once each of them reach the profit target (not more than 10 pips) than suddenly open the closed hedge again and so on. Actually I try to use a slightly modified old EA of Master Steve Hopwood (the Dryclean's Brijon game playing multi-pairauto trader by SteveHopwood.mq4). I made the two version for BBS and SSB, but for some reason that I'm not able to fix, if you put the two EAs on the same account, only one of them work excluding the other, also if the Magic Number is set different. Maybe someone more expert than me can fix it.

Thanks

P.S.: The EA attached have also many different features that are disabled because not usefull for this strategy

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thanks Simihouse, I'll take a look.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Following the same logic other tradables 3 pairs hedgings (BBS and SSB) shoulhd be the followings:

USDCHF CHFJPY USDJPY

GBPNZD NZDCAD GBPCAD

AUDNZD NZDCAD AUDCAD

AUDNZD NZDCHF AUDCHF

GBPNZD NZDUSD GBPUSD

GBPCHF EURGBP EURCHF

But maybe the correlation values of these pairs are less stable than EU UC EC. Anyway can worth give a try.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Ok Guys,

the system works! I just closed my first EU UC EC BBS basket with 0,73 $ on my live Forex.com account, I traded 0,01 lots. I feel that these small cents are the most important since I started trade forex. The EA TP is 10 pips but the market moved quickly and the close all trades of the EA took a little bit more time than ususal. Everything we need now is an EA that allow us to trade different hedges on the same account each one with the own TP and possibly close the profitable hedges as quickly as possible. Nothing more nothing less. We are so close to the Holy Grail with this KISS system??? Let's go see Knights

--- 帖子 #402 ---
thanks, but still not quite sure how to read this indicator.

here's my screen, am i doing it correctly?

--- 帖子 #403 ---
alright, finally add the values in to the indicator.

Blue= EUR/USD     Red=USD/CAD    GREEN=EUR/CAD

how do we determine wheather is positive or negative correlations?

and what time should be the reference? 1-min, 5-min or even longer 30-min, 1-hour ?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Imnicetoyou,

as I wrote before, in my opinion, this strategy works without any indicator and is unrelated to any timeframe. If you BBS and SSB in the meantime the pair circle EU UC and EC you froze your account, so you can enter in any time you want. But also if the account is frozen the single circles have an inner dynamic that make them oscillating around relatively narrow values. Than you must only wait untill one of them go in profit and close that hedge, than open the close hedge again and start a new one. The only things usefull is a tool for monitoring the hedges. I found the indicator @Hedge-Backtest@ that works good. I attach here the screenshot of yesterday and the indicator. As you can see the two specular hedges follow an oscillating pattern, soon or late they will come in profit zone (up to 100 that means 10 pips because I put a lot value of 1.0 in the indicator).

I attach also an EA that can be useful for open multiple hedge trades, actually I'm testing if works properly. Is the MyHedge of Awangk.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Based on your screenshots, your SSB basket had a net Long position of approximately 0.46 lots USDCHF and your BBS basket had a net Short position of approximately 0.46 lots USDCHF.

Didn't you notice that your basket total profit lines perfectly followed the movement of USDCHF ?

Why would you pay approximately 6 times the spread cost trading 2 baskets of 3 pairs (1 lot each x 6 trades) when you could just as easily trade 0.46 lots of USDCHF both long and short (0.46 lots each x 2 trades) ?

Can you explain how this system could ever possibly be profitable in the long run?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi Zznbrm.

yes I realized it, and I realized also that the shape of the hedge monitor is far more smooth than the simple EC curve. Moreover, can you explain me how I can get profit if I simply buy and sell 1 lot of EC in the meantime? If we can find a way to save our two spreads I will be happy to know it, but the goal of hedging is pay spreads for save drawdown.

What about the Long Run...I don't know really...do you know?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thank you imnicetoyou,your explanation is correct. You can also make a good use of the indicator by changing the parameter of 100,1,1 to 10,3,3.

zznbrm, you dont need all those mathematics to be profitable using this system.It works like an automatic money exchanger.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
The shape of the hedge monitor would parallel the movement of USDCHF, not EURCHF.

I cannot. I do not see how you could possibly get profit from simultaneously buying and selling 1 lot of EC.

IMO, your current system cannot be profitable in the long run (or the short run for that matter).

You may want to consider the Phantom threads. They seem to be making some progress with basket trading.

Good luck with your trading!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I'm not sure what "system" you are referring to, but my response to Simihouse was regarding his version from a few posts back. Basic mathematics is at the very core of his system (and can be used to show how it will not turn a profit).

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Ok Zznbrm,

as you know EC and UC are positively correlated so the shape is more or less exactly the same.

here are the "pictures" of "Long Run" (since 14.01.2011) of the hedge.

As you can see the curve is NO similar to nothing, is a simple oscillator in a range of more or less 300 pips up and down.

I'm not shure if this system can give profit in the long time, but is the only way to buy and sell in the meantime EC (or UC if you like) and take profit from theirs oscillations (whatever Up or Down).

I'm pretty sure, because I tried it, that the Phantom system is an account killer. Better is the Basket 14 version 05 that I still run on a demo.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Simihouse,

I really don't know what to tell you. Again, it is just simple math. To understand basket trading (how you are trading it), you must understand the math behind the basket. You need to understand that every basket has a net exposure. Sometimes (in a perfectly hedged basket) the net exposure is 0. But usually, regardless of the number of pairs in the basket, there is some net exposure - it could be 1 currency or multiple currencies. Regardless, the secret to this type of basket trading is getting your net exposure where it has its best chance to get your profits. How do we do that? Well, I guess that is up to each trader to figure out.

I've attached a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the math behind the EC-EU-UC Buy-Sell-Sell basket.

Good luck with your trading!

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I am willing to write this, but I'm missing a few things:Entry and Exit rules (if you "scalp", when does the scalp end). Pairs and timeframes.  What is your "base" pair (the "B" in SSB) and the "Hedge Pairs". I'm assuming that "correlation" is the same as a statistical correlation (I've got an indicator for that I wrote some time ago) based on Close prices.

Yes, I've read the entire thread too.

Let me know if there's any interest; besides those PM'ing me.  I'm willing to write if y'all willing to test.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Ok Guys,

finally I got an EA that works and that we can use at least for a forward test in a demo. The EA is a mod of the NewHedge EA of LazyForexTrading. The settings are 0.1 lots and the TP is set to 10 pips, virtually no stop loss. Put the two EAs in the same time on two different charts.

Sure every hedge has an exposure, thats means that everytime we close a trade in profit the opposite trade is in loss. The problem here is try to figure how can be the BIGGEST drawdown (this is the case if the specular hedges works as an oscillator between two max-min values). In this case the loss should be stabilized while we take the profits from the movements of market, folllowing more or less the movement of EC (as correctly stated Zznbrm). In the case that the losses not go at any stabilization the strategy of course cannot work on the "long run". I'm not so strong in mathematics...but if exists a way to get money from the forex market (as per my limited experience) will be only through the "basket hedging strategies". Maybe someone can disagree, but we must forget about indicators, timeframes and so on, they are only a big waste of time and money. We must only find a way to stand the drawdowns while keeping (small) profits on the way WHATEVER the market do, WHEREVER the market go. So I call all the traders to work around this project here or, if you want, in a new thread.

At this purpose, as soon I checked the new EA I'm working on, I will propose another "variation on the theme" of Basket 101 trading.

So, let's go work togheter.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
So, these EA's open orders providing there aren't any currently open?  It doesn't look for possible trend / convergence / divergence / correlation / etc.?

That's this strategy?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Nondisclosure00,

Yes, the ultimate goal of every basket/hedging strategy is try to get money letting balanced pairs play togheter, let them freely flow the markets naturals waves. The challenge of these strategies is STAND THE DRAWDOWN that is the risk linked to every trade. As another trader in this forum stated (sorry I not remember the name) in the Forex game is not important how much money you can get...but how much money you risk for get it. The hedging strategies try to copes this terrible "Hydra", the DD, while the traditional simple indicator-following strategies are unable to do it. If you let a well balanced basket (with a small exposure) run, you will have a profit, soon or late, with a limited or virtually 0 risk. If we are able to find a strategy like this...well we can call it the "Grail".

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thanks Sim.

Then this doesn't fit my strategy all that well.  I don't want to open positions at random and hold on to them until they get a profit.  That's just asking for margin calls eventually.

I'll stick to my convergence/divergence of prices between actual pairs and synthetics created through other currencies (Tri arb for short).

Hello Forexable.

From 26 May to 28 June I have profit of 155 pips.I not have a deal closed at a loss for this period. I trade a real account with micro-lots for this system.I use micro lots, because I'm still in trial period for this system. I never try a new system on demo because I think it not gives a real idea of ​​the trade.

Specifically to your question - my capital growth for this period with 23%.

I trade manually, but I think this is bad about this system because they do not always catch the right moment to close the position at a profit.I hope to begin testing the EA in this month.

I wish you successful trading

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Just curious here, but how do you determine your exit trigger?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I close my position when I am at least 15 pips profit.I think closing the position should be done automatically because the only way to guarantee that you will not miss the timing of closing.

Good luck

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hmmm, interesting.

I've been thinking about an EA for this for quite some time.  The only difference being I didn't want to arbitrarily open the positions and hope for the best.  I want at least a "head start" or something.  Like a linear regression slope on the minute charts  going in the right BBS or SSB direction.

Are you looking for something to trigger your input or just opening orders and waiting?

alright just an update so far been trying this out this week, my first week.  opened up 3 times and all were in profit. 30 dollars profit each.  so up 90+ dollars this week.  biggest dd was 39 on my last three pairs but managed to be in profit about 15 minutes ago.  now opened my 4th position.  will update more as time goes on. this is all still on demo.  will give it a try till the end of this month.  if i could make 125 a week doing this a building it up over time.  then all is is good.  yes i know there will be big dd as some point but i have yet to experience it.  wish me luck.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
You are probably going to start noticing your basket does good when USDCHF goes down and it does bad when USDCHF goes up.

Do you understand why that is?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
yes because the other pairs eliminate each other.  so the driving force is the u/c.  but i think if i didnt have the 50 dollar sl then i think it would of came back for a profit.  now sure how much but it wouldnt have been a loss.  i have 2 ea's that will close out at a profit or a loss.  thats the only way i can tp is if the ea closes them on time.  cant monitor them as it takes a while for them to profit.  my 6th hedge is still going but at a loss right now so will have to wait if it profitable one or not.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
If "the other pairs eliminate each other", why are you trading them? You are paying 4x the spread for no benefit.

USDCHF is not only the driving force, it is the "only force" in your basket.

You are shorting the USDCHF. It is as simple as that.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
yes i understand the spread issue here.  what this strategy does is not set a sl therefor not worrying about getting stopped out all the time as if you were only long or short the u/c.  like i said just trying it out on demo not really doing it live.  dont know if i will.  like with other systems on here you have to try it out to make sure that it works or not. my 6th hedge is still active and will keep it at that until i get a profit of 30 dollars.  so it could take a long time who knows.   time will tell..

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Your not really hedging anything. If taking a 1:1:1 position all your doing is trading the pair spread. Take a look at the picture, shorting gbp/chf and going long usd/chf and gbp/usd at any time in the past would net you positive results, but if you take the opposite side then you will continue to lose as the trend or the ratio is down.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
hey andy where can i get that indi?  is it some special platform that i have to download?  thanks.  would like to use it as when it reverses then i can trade the opposite.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hey andy after looking at your chart there. it looks like its think or swim platform. i have that platform too.  can you plz tell me how you got the 3 pairs to show like you have on your chart?  thanks

--- 帖子 #446 ---
no worries. just enter gbp/chf-usd/chf. You can create ratio charts with what ever you want just separate using dash or hyphen. The indicators are pair ratio and pair correlation.

The strategy is similar to pair trading which is when you take the pair ratio of two correlated and co-integrated assets and plot a moving average then act accordingly as the ratio separates from the ma by x std deviations (typical from my reading is 2.7)

--- 帖子 #447 ---
thanks for the reply andy. now how do you use the chart and the and pick a direction?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
well like I said. You need software that will plot an MA on the pair ratio and you enter based on said ratios deviation from the mean. In this case you would have to be dollar neutral hence your hedging out market direction and betting on the ratio of the two assets to diverge or converge (depending on conditions of entry). If you want to go with a 1:1 ratio (1lot long 1short) then you can use a fundamental based approach to determine why and if the spread should diverge or converge. Hence going short in the chart I posted and trying to determine when/if the trend will reverse.

I might not be a guru but from what i have observed, one pair does not drive the basket. As unprofitable as this strategy might be, it is not because uc is the only pair. I wrote an ea for the system and ran it for a good while. The pattern of the losses did not correlate with the performance of just one pair.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Please help us with a brief doubts :

a) How much is the TP ( in pips ) of GU/EG/EU ring?

b) How much spread do you have on these 3 pairs on average?

c) How much hours in average take for close/open a new ssb or bbs based on your TP?

d) Wichs rings are you seen more volatiles/profitables?

I am begining to play with GU/EG/EU with TP 5 pips, Spread on 3 pairs is almost times 6 pips...

Thanks

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Mt4 can't let u enter fractional units so i wonder hw u test but tts not the problem.

I hv no idea hw u calculate your "correlation". If u used any kind of tp or sl, u already changed ur data. Any money management should NOT be used.

Are you really sure u know hw to calculate ur residual exposure? Whatever your EA does and the results are totally irrelevant.

A simple test will reveal everythig to u. Just get the close of anyday a mth ago and open ur equal lot size basket, calculate ur net exposure and multiply it by the pip move since then till now. Its freaking clear. I wonder what is making it so hard for you guys to understand?

Hi Simihouse

I don't know yet if you follow this topic.

On your indy, on the first line (HEDGE) there are EURUSD USDCHF EURCHF and TOTAL PROFIT.....OK... ie   B , B , S and ( B+B+S)

It's well but I'd like it shows also a factor and its curve.

This factor is (B+B)/S ie the sum of the 2 buys divided by the sell.

In my opinion, this factor is important to enter (or close) a trade.

My idea is to open a demo chart to enter according this indicator.

Best regards.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Madscalp,

sorry but after many trials and errors I definitively decided to leave the hedging strategies...finally I must agree with Zznbrm: they are not profitables on the long run.

Actually I work on an entirely different strategy based on momentum and ADR. It's essentially a counter-trend strategy and I call i the "Tao Chinese Merchant" strategy. I follow this strategy for a month with nice results and I plan to open a new thread as soon as I have more positives feedbacks.

Anyway I'm still open to any kind of experimentation.

All the best

--- 帖子 #459 ---
OK I understand...

However could you make the display of this factor with or without the curve ...it's easy for you.

If I get good results with my idea, of course I'll post ...

I'm very excited about your next thread.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Sorry Madscalp, but if you refer to the Baket Profit 3 pairs indy this is not mine but of Squalou, moreover I'm not able to modify the indy, my base knowledge on Metaquote is not so good....

BTW I'm working hard to the new thread..see you soon there

--- 帖子 #461 ---
ZZNBRM, Actually you can be quite profitable buying and selling the same currency at the same time.  I've been doing it myself on a live account for the last 6 months and am up 200%  If you are going to hedge, you cannot have a 20 pip take profit!  You need to take profit at a minimum 100 + pips.  You need to clear out your trades when you do come in to profit and start over.  You also need to establish at what point you will bail on all your trades if the your pair start trending.  Just my 2cents.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
My thought is totally different.

I need the indicator described above in a demo.

When this indy is OK, on another chart I trigger  BBS or SSB according the indy.

Then I take profit if EquityProfitPercent (Equity/Balance) is reaching 2 or 3 % or more ...no hedge...

If for example the BBS loses 2 or 3 % , I trigger again a BBS to wait the profit of both BBS.

Idem for SSB...

Of course, it's just an idea. If I can get this indy and if the results are good, I open a new thread since there is no hedge.

How?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
this is nothing new.  what was originally said by the OP is not the real arb.  it's trend trading the same currency one way but paying spread 3 times and that is not risk free.

the trading that the others and I have read about know what this is....it's arbitrage.  and you don't have to do just triangles.  linear,  four ring, five ring.  etc.

you think an mt broker, or ANY RETAIL BROKER is fast enough to let you open and close 3 trades all at once?  my vps at THE QUICKEST is 43 ms...you need AT LEAST half of that to arb right and 1 mil USD on the reuters or icap to do it.  just learn to trend trade and build up your account then do it over there on the institutional side because that's where you best bet of doing this is.  either that or try to find a broker who'd let you do 2 broker arb without them finding out.  but they'll know once you turned 10,000 into 600k in about 10 days lol

it has been tried but this person would not say which brokers he used.  this is is his statement and he disconnected the demo once he knew it does work and exist.

I mean, would you say ANYTHING TO ANYBODY if you knew this edge...what the hell, i would not tell ANYONE lol

one day...one day for me!

WARNING..the attached file is not mine but the results speak for themselves as to where brokers are weak at.  they'd probably kick you out after a while though most likely.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
How do you determine what is a ring and what isn't?  I've seen a few different ideas on this.

ie.  Forex is fractions.

a/b, b/c, a/c.  A ring. EUR/USD, USD/CHF, EUR/CHF.  Or, a/b * b/c = a/c.  EUR/USD * USD/CHF = EUR/CHF.  Now, how do you trade this, BUY BUY SELL, BUY SELL SELL, etc.

I get the looking for trends for those pairs.  But what is the correct direction?  And take a look at http://kreslik.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=56803.  The post by Capella.  The post that Hazelj180 was talking about.  Is this the approach?  What exactly was the approach?

I see this as being possible, as long as you take the code "outside" of MT.  Like a DLL or even Excel, if you want complicated computations to make the determination and don't want to DLL it.

I've already done data sharing between 2 terminals (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=310349).  It's profitable, if you're willing to wait a few hundred years.

So, I'm willing to code if someone can explain to me how Capella's idea is supposed to work.  Rings I have created failed in the long run.

So im trying to work out a 3-way hedge that will make a regular income on the swap

ok so it involves going short on USD/MXN, MXN/JPY and long on USD/JPY, therefore creating a 3-way hedge

pip values in USD per lot are as follows (if my calculations are correct)

USD/MXN = 0.7185

USD/JPY = 12.9863

MXN/JPY = 32.3632

Swap values at 1/10/2011 from Alpari UK are as follows

USD/MXN = +82 units per lot

USD/JPY = -0.4 units per lot

MXN/JPY = -0.7 units per lot

so if we ratio these pip values and put on trades as follows

USD/MXN short 45 lots

USD/JPY long 2.5 lots

MXN/JPY short 1 lot

each pip movement in any direction on any currency pair should be of equal value in USD

and the overall position should remain at the original negative value relative to the spread on each currency pair + or - some variation in spreads

Current Spreads are as follows

USD/MXN = 32.7 pips

USD/JPY = 2.2 pips

MXN/JPY = 40.52 pips

Using the ratio of lot sizes to maintain an equal pip value, each pip = USD$32.36 or close enough

Therefore inital position would be -$2440.59 and stay there throughout the open positions, + or - some variation in spreads

The margin needed to trade a total of 48.5 lots at 500:1 = $9700, plus the margin to cover the spread(say $2500) = $12,200. so i think you could safely say $20,000 should be enough to cover the widening spreads should they occur

first day of trade, lets say a monday,

USD/MXN 45 lots = 3690 units, 369 pips x 0.7185 = $265.13

USD/JPY 2.5 lots = -1 unit, -0.1 pip x 12.9863 = -$1.30

MXN/JPY 1 lot = -0.7 unit, -0.07pip x 32.3632 = -$2.27

Total swap = $261.56, with a floating position of -$2179.03 and margin used $9700.

total equity = $17,820.97

at the end of week one, 6 more swaps (wed x3)

USD/MXN $265.13 x 6 = $1590.78

USD/JPY -$1.30 x 6 = -$7.80

MXN/JPY -$2.27 x 6 = -$13.62

total swap = $1569.36 with a floating position of -$609.67 and margin used $9700.

total equity = $19,390.33 almost covering the loss on open positions already

and so on, this is assuming no dramatic changes in pip values, i would imagine this would need to be monitored regularly and update lots sizes accordingly. also assuming swap values remain, this would need to be monitored regularly also.

By end of week 2 should start making money

Does anybody have any idea if this might work in practise? it seems to work in theory

Ok.  So here's my ring: EURUSD - EURGBP - GBPUSD , in this order

Now, how is the ring supposed to go?

BBS and SSB

BSS and SBB

HI Cash4u

Your system is great.Can you please let us know how long you have been using this system?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi belka

can you show us how to use martingale with this system?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
95% this thread can only kill newbies and confuse the readers

why not the admin of FF just shut down this kind of crap?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
how do you doing it, please share,

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I think the idea with the martingale system is just to add x pips when you reach Y drawdown. Y would be exponential.

eurusd

eurgbp

gbpusd

You want to be careful you are not trading 2*EUR & GBP.

Why not add another currency pair. make it more even?

eurchf  Buy

audgbp Buy

nzdjpy  Buy

usdcad Buy

This system is a good one. It is not a perfect arb, because the lot are fixed (1, 0.1 for all three pairs) but hedging SSB with BBS you override the problem.

I you arb perfectly with balanced lots the winner is the broker

When I speak about balanced lot I mean:

EURUSD 1 lot (I but 1 lot EUR and I sell 1.31 lot USD)

EURCHF 1 lot

USDCHF 1.31 lot

Above the 3 pairs are perfectly balanced but the spread is the winner

Opening fixed lot (1 lot for all pair) SSB and BBS in the same time, you are protected from  DD and in the same time you have a little difference between pair and then create the profit.

Not important when you enter in the 6 trades, important is when a trade close

to reopen soon.

The system need patience; you can close a trade in 1 hour or some days

Thank you Cash and all have helped to understand better the system

Hello, I just joined the community.

Wishing you all a prosperous 2012 .

I read the thread and I am guessing that most realize by now that Lonestar and zznbrm were right regarding the original idea posted by cash4u2.

Nevertheless I am somewhat an addict for  hedging in any type of shape or form.

Correlated pairs, Perfect market rings/inefficiency , arbitrages etc. Therefore, I have been testing

a similar concept to the  original posted by cash4u2 but with some twists.

My results look promising in forward test, and would like to backtest the strategy to minimize risk. ( no risk, no profit, no matter what anybody say) but I am stuck in finding how to test the 3 pairs simultaneously. Not only because the strategy is multi-pair, but because we use an EA and because is  in renko chart.

In a nutshell the strategy consider bits of correlation theory, 3-pair hedging  theory and  Averaging down theory, etc.

We use our own EA  (as a tool)  that execute trades at close of bar (forward or reverse to the direction of closed bar, with lot, tp, sl , global tp, etc.)

Example using EUR/USD,   USD/CHF , EUR/CHF.

These 3 pairs would make an impeccable (perfect) hedge "IF" mt4 or mt4 broker would allow decimal lots size

like 0.21025451. but they don’t, therefore we can use a fix equal lot for all 3 pairs, say 0.30 and here is were we use the renko chart to compensate for the UN-impeccable hedge and take advantage of the fact that  EUR/USD and USD/CHF are negative correlated (not always) and that

EUR/USD*USD/CHF=EUR/CHF (always, but between a small inefficiency factor)

To set the EA we  “assume”  that  EUR/USD  and USD/CHF are perfect negative correlated. Example:

say the current prices are   EUR/USD= 1.2985 and USD/CHF=0.9385 … then EUR/CHF=1.2186 (1.2985*0.9385)

If we are assuming perfect correlation, this  means  if EUR/USD moves 20 pips up, then USD/CHF would move 20 pips down and we would have 1.3005, 0.9365 and  (1.3005*0.9365)1.2179. In other words EUR/CHF moved only 7 pips down.

Therefore I would set the EA for EUR/USD and USD/CHF in a 20 pips renko charts and EUR/CHF in a 7 pips renko chart. EUR/USD buy only, USD/CHF buy only and EUR/CHF sell only. ..no TP, no SL but set to CloseALL when in X profits.

To get a better picture, the EA would buy EUR/USD at close of the 20 pips renko bar (if the bar is up bar). If  the closed bar is a down bar,  EA does  nothing. For USD/UCH would do the same and for EUR/CHF would do the opposite (sells only in the 7 pips renko chart)

I think this approach has potential, but long and tedious  without back testing to fine tune or find the weak spots.

I am sharing the idea with the hope that someone would be able to help with the back test issues.

Or with the math.  We are able to code anything for mt4, but for lack of time  we can not get involve in rewriting our tool EA and a renko indicator for platforms that can back test  multi-pairs.

The idea is quite simple and easy to grasp with  a little imagination.

I do not want to get involve in much discussion/explanation  about  renko charts or if the strategy is good or bad.

I mention that this has “potential” , perhaps in the 10-15% per month if used with the proper leverage.

I am aware system is a spread eater, but in the other hand could be good to use in brokers that give bonuses for deposits for traded lots. Back test definitely would  provide better clues about profitable and any ideas are welcome.

I will consider sharing the tool EA will those that first contribute to the concept. But I am sure

a similar can we found in here or other sources . I will post some stats from my ongoing forward demos

when allowed or when I figure how to do it.

I would start a new thread under  3 Pair hedging/renko to start fresh only with people interested in the twist but I read I can start a new one as a junior new member.  If any of the seniors want to start one  I could re-post there.  System does not need any indicators. No need to suggest nor discuss them.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Interesting.

OK for a new thread.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
In the last paragraph of my first post I meant to say that I would like to start a new thread but I can not.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Here is 1 month of forward testing with 1 setting. Started Dec 5 and ended

Jan 5 (I used peppertone demo. They are good for 1 month only).

I used 0.30 lot in all 3 pairs. It made 781 trades for a total of 234 full round lots traded. $5000 account  made $2761.56/55.23% . Total DD was 7.83%.

I hope you see the need to get into a good backtest for the strategy. I mean if these stats would be similar every month, it would be wise to place a 10% safety global SL for the account and even if get triggered twice per month , the account still would in the profit at the end.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Which set of 3 pairs did you trade?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
As the example in my first post:

EUR/USD,   USD/CHF and EUR/CHF.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
sounds very interesting!

my only concern to this strategy is...time.

we have no clue how long it would take to end up +$

during that time, our swap will prbly be -$

but your new approach sounds reasonable and steady

thank you for sharing, and keep us all updated!

regards,

J

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hello JhFx.

I agree, idle time in dd is always an important  factor to consider in this type of systems. For this specific set it was OK for the 30 days and sort of  cost of doing the business (-45.29 interest). The stats show 2day 17hrs for the longest trade held.

I am sure that was a EUR/CHF entry because EUR/USD and USD/CHF  is set to 15 pips TP and 15 pips SL (1/1 risk/reward ratio) and these as you can imagine are closed very quick...and ClosingAll trades when system achieve $20 of equity gain.

Hi,

What negative direction you are talking about can you show on chart preview

what time frame U use to look direction

please explain

thanks

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I‘m sorry to say this but i see no meaning in trying this kind of system.

say

GBPUSD = Buy

USDCHF = Buy

GBPCHF = Sell

all 1 lot,use the price now

frist,you buy 1 lot GBPUSD means you buy 100K gbp spend 162K usd

than,you buy 1 lot usdchf means you buy 100K usd spend 91K chf

finally,you sell 1 lot gbpchf means you sell 100K gbp and get 147K chf

you see you buy 100K gbp and than sell 100K gbp,(so actually you has nothing to do with gbp);you buy 100K and you spend 162K usd;you spend 91K chf and you get 147K chf.

so if you add this all,you actually buy 56K chf and spend 62K usd,which is equal to sell about 0.67 lot usdchf.

so,why don't you sell this this much usdchf directly?and do you think you will always make pips just by sell this or buy this random without any thing else?

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi every one,

I read all thread and pierre, cash4u,and jeuro they tried to explain but i donot think every one understood what they talk about only they are telling about hedging pairs even though you have good system and for further test every one may be curious about

what time frame m5 m15 m30 1h should we?

what is entry and exit style need some screen shots?

what is better session?

sorry for english

thanks

--- 帖子 #495 ---
For SSB and BBS (the pair have to be perfectly balanced)

Time frame is indifferent

entry style indifferent

exit when you are in profit; use Close All

Session is indifferent

--- 帖子 #496 ---
hi,

this is what we donot understand "the pair have to be balanced"

What is this mean and how do we check to see balanced?

any indicator can you explain in detail or show us some screen shots

thanks very much sir

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Balanced means the trades are neutral

BUY EURUSD

BUY USDCHF

SELL EURCHF

(buy eur, sell usd)

(buy usd, sell chf)

(sell eur, buy chf)

OR

SELL EURUSD

SELL USDCHF

BUY  EURCHF

So you are perfectly balanced; only one problem ; the spread.

when for market inefficiency you are in profit you close all trades.

you have to use closeall EA setting the profit you wish

If you use the EA posted the 27th april, they reopen the 3 trade automatically as 3 trades close

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hi,

Ok

IS this balanced

Sell EURUSD

Buy EURGBP

Buy GBPUSD

If this is balanced Then

I did SSB and BBS same time  and both basket are in negative

May be these pairs not in balanced

Thanks

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Sell EURUSD

Sell EURGBP

= you sell twice euro, you buy usd and you buy gbp

balanced = you buy and sell the same  foreign currency

1)Buy eurusd

2)Buy usdchf

3)Sell usdchf

1) buy eur you sell usd

2)you buy usd you sell chf

3)you sell usd you buy chf

--- 帖子 #500 ---
when you buy eurusd  you are buying euro and selling usd

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Sell EURUSD

Buy EURGBP

Buy GBPUSD

yes they are balanced

but when you open the 3 trades you pay the spread and you have DD; you have to leave the trade floating and wait; broker with tight spread are better

--- 帖子 #502 ---
HI,

yes It has been floating for 4 days and still nagative

The post "Three Pairs Hedging " has been actively here for over a year. Any over year results (not those backtest ones)?

well, I 've been testing this sys on demo for a month, result was good.  But I think a SL is a MUST, cos we cannot predict the DD (pip loss and the time period to recove) maybe -200pips or few months I dunno.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi E2u,

you have start date in it

I thought about it when I was losing -100 pips, glad that I didnt.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
don't you try to add more position when losing -200 pips. and hope it bounce back , and you could get profit from second position? just my opinion

--- 帖子 #515 ---
what if it goes to -400 pips after i added.?  no edge

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hi all,

as someone said before, it is not a fully hedged trade because of the unbalanced LOT adjustment. If they were 100% balanced, there was no profit or loss, a part from the spread.

This means that the trade is in favour (or against) of a certain pair, for a small portion of the lot size.

It's like trading a pair with microlots and closing it when it is in profit.... I am sorry but I don't see anything more than that!

I wish I was wrong....

Do you have some picture of such EA and Config?

How to use the FPI ?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
FPI is really tough on Mt4 esp since feeds are filtered and any arb's broker's will try to take advantage of before you. You really need institutional price feeds and then your big competitors are still banks who are arb'ing off each other before you can. You might get a few arb's a day though during volatility if u can get in, but ur never gauranteed to get ur second and third leg thru. If only there is a fill or kill order for multiple currency pairs at once, I'd be very interested if this existed somewhere.

Also does ur system trade the pairs with same lot size? If so that's not FPI... your still exposed.

Need to manage capital

Why are not taken to enter

Lot size 0.05 or $ 1

You are working on more than one pairs 3 pairs, not only must be the size of a small lot

This is a very big if you are working on other pairs at the same time

Lot 1 only states with only one set

Do not enter another

If you want other countries must reduce the size of the lot

I want to tell you that a year ago I wrote a great EA based on this model and it did quit good results till... YES (as you feel) the cross pairs of the tree pairs went wildly upterd or downtrend, and I loos money.

Has anyone used the EA or done it manually?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
So... I read the first 20 or so pages of this thread and then skipped to the end so I could ask some questions.

The concept seems (almost) sound and I'm willing to invest some time in it.

The concsensus (I think) is that the concept has merit when the spreads are low.

I'm happy to write an EA that will do the following:

1.  Trade both BBS and SSB strategies concurently in the same account with a single EA.

2.  Wait for the combined spreads to be within so many pips (parameter).

3.  Quickly execute one strategy with a unique magic number.

4.  Test again for spreads being acceptable.

5.  Execute the other strategy with a unique magic number.

6.  Monitor both strategies and quit either one if the profit level for that strategy (only) is so mahy pips (parameter).

7.  Once the trades for one of the strategies have been closed, start monitoring again for the spread being within so many pips.

8.  Complete auto pilot... goes forever.

9.  The only time that the EA will be flat or only have one strategy on the go is when spreads are wider than acceptable.

I assume that nobody has coded this yet?

Is there interest in trying this?

Thoughts on how to make it better?

It will take about 20 minutes to code and a couple hours to test after the markets open.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I'm still sceptical, but I've coded the EA and will test it when the markets open.   I've seen a lot of posts that say it is impossible to consistenly make money with this strategy.   But, I have to give it a try to satisfy myself.

The new EA will always be in the market as long as the spreads (on entry) are reasonable.   Spreads on exit aren't relevant, as the EA is only concerned with the net profit.

It will be on auto pilot when the market opens.  Will let you know how testing goes.

Assuming that it performs well, I need to add the ability to trade more pairs and a few more features.   At that point, I'm happy to post the EA here.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I've let the following pair run upon opening last Friday morning.  Even though the pip cost is not equal, I opened 50K(USD) positions on each

S EURUSD

B GBPUSD

B EURGBP

The net sum went into $35 profit at one point (didn't note the time) and at the NY session close (close for the week) the net sum is -$16.  This does work. It won't go positive every trading day, but it is useful to open a triangle hedge, let it run for a week not closing any positions and it will be relatively hedged with a net sum oscillating +/-.  Spreads do need to be tight upon opening.  I usually wait until 6-8 hrs after the Sydney session opens then.

Let it run manually to see how it works before you put much more time into it.  Look for pairs with tight spreads and high ADR.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
at a first glance, the ring EURJPY/CHFJPY/EURCHF seems to be the safest

And this is only because of the "fact" that EURCHF will not fall below 1.20

So my choice would be

S EURJPY

L CHFJPY

L EURCHF

when EURCHF is <= 1.23

I would even close the ring partially if the profit of the JPY positions is positive with a certain amount and keep a negative eurchf position knowing my current risk is max 300 pips and 1.23 is a level that isn't too hard to reach again for that pair

So overall it would be a long eurchf "speculation" with the benefit of making some extra pips when eurchf is going down

Thanks for shared and completed with trading performance also. Hedging is one of the good trading strategy if we know the right pairs to trade with. thank you very much

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Trading 0.50 lot in each pair your hedge is imperfect. You traded (net) approximately 0.07 lot long gbp/usd . The profit or loss you get will be from the imbalance.

Ck it out.   At the time your balance was +35, you probably had the gbp/usd some 50 pips up  from entry, and at the close, some 22 pips below entry.

Why don't you trade only long 0.07 lot gbp/usd ... you will save a lot of spread.?

What is the math formula to come up with a ratio in excel for 3 pairs so that a max and min range can be established over a given sample size? I have downloaded the price data and just need to plug it in the spreadsheet.

Is the correct?

=(A1*B1/2)/C1

were

A1 = GBPUSD

B1 = EURGPB

C1 = EURUSD

for a buy/buy/sell

--- 帖子 #546 ---
The combination of pip cost and imperfect correlation is what makes it imperfect, yes, it's the imbalance, making it unhedged is how it's profitable.  It was actually +90pips.

The advantages of using this triangle hedge is , no SL needed, so you won't get hit by stop hunters.  I can go to sleep at night with several of these setup, let them run and not worry about it.  Start watching which pairs are going in the right direction, add a little to the position, hold it longer term and spread isn't an issue.  If it goes the wrong way, it's somewhat hedged, more than one position in any of the three pairs.

I see no advantage using the triangle.  Your trades net is aprox 0.07 long in the gbp/usd.  Just go long 0.07 in the gbp/usd, dont put a SL and wait. Is the same of what you are doing now.  If you want to hedge or ad later, just do it with 0.01 or so...

If the GU moves 100 pips up from entry, you will have aprox 70 profit (100 pips x 0.70c=70).

if the GU moves 100 pips down from your entry, you will have 70 loss.

Ok.... here it is.... the EA that I promised.   It's technically working fine.   It has already completed two profitable trades, one hour into trading.

As written, it will trade four different triangular "hedges".

If it continues to be profitable, with negligible drawdowns, I will be enhancing it considerably.

Each of the triangular hedges has its own Magic number.

Thanks for your efforts Chuck!  Nice one!

The parameter settings should be obvious.... but I can see how they might not be.

MaxSpread (default at 5 pips).   No trades will be done (for any set of three) if the spread on any of the pairs is more than MaxSpread pips.   I envisage setting this to 2 pips (depending on the broker) during U.S. trading hours, perhaps wider at other times.   If you set MaxSpread too low, you won't get very many trades.   Set it too high and it could take a couple of hours or days to close trades at a profit.   The next version will have MaxSpread for each set... as some pairs require a higher spread.

ProfitPerFullLot (default is $100).   If you are trading 0.01 lots (with the default setting) all three positions within a set will be closed with a $1 profit.   If you are trading 1.0 lots, the EA will quit all three positions when the open profit is $100 or more.

At the moment, the EA won't work on brokers with a suffix on their symbols.   Next version will sort this out.

"Lots" should be obvious.

The EA has now done four profitable trades in 1.5 hours.   I'm happy (enough) with this EA.   I hope it makes some money for you.   It appears to be rock solid.... that's the main thing.   It closes positions when it needs to.... one thing that a lot of EA's fail to do.

Good trading!!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
New version of EA....

1.  Now handles brokers with suffixes on symbols.

2.  Now has five trio combinations (instead of four).

3.  Now lets you set MaxSpread for each combination.

By the way, my trading is always on live accounts with several brokers, not on useless demo accounts.

BUT.... I encourage you to try this on demo accounts until you at least get a feel for how it trades.

Currently sitting on four closed trades ($398) with five open combinations with DD of $72.   You can count on an immediate DD as soon as trades are open.   That's the spreads.

Next version I'll probably let you "dabble" with the pairs.  So far, the pairs have been fixed.

You can see the pairs (in this version) where it prompts you for MaxSpread for each combination.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I've read your post about 5 times and I'm still not sure if I understand what you mean correctly. But if you're looking to do a buy buy sell ring of GU EG EU then:

A1 * B2 - C1 gives you the correct triangular relationship and the residual is essentially EU - EU. However as jeuro points out if you size the pairs the same you don't get cancellation of risk. If you are trading equal size for the 3 pairs then the formula is effectively A1 + B1 -C1 which as you can verify will move quite a lot due to the sizes not cancelling. To get the A1*B2 - C1 formula or GU*EG - EU you will need to size the pairs properly. To do this I suggest you read up on the subject as this all relates to triangular arbitrage: Triangular arbitrage lot size

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Expanding on what jeuro said with putting his words to a test - is the exposure really effectively long 0.7 lot GU or something else that will make money any day with no stop loss with sound sleeping due to the (mean reverting) imbalance between the pairs? Let's let the numbers speak for themselves. Using the calculations found on the link in my previous post I start with the assumptions based on current (bid) market prices:
Attached Image

S EU 1.29087 -50000 EUR +64544 USD

B GU 1.50848 +50000 GBP -75424 USD

B EG 0.85562 +50000 EUR -42781 GBP

residuals:

EUR -50000 + 50000 = 0

GBP +50000 -42781 = 7219

USD +64544 - 75424 = -10880

So effectively long 7219 GBP, short 10880 USD are the only imbalances.

Working back from the GBP to USD you get 7219 x 1.50848 = 10864 so effectively this is long 0.7219 lots of GU with a residual of 16 USD possibly due to rounding or due to using bid prices for ease of calculation instead of bid/ask prices.

In summary I would say that the sound sleep, no stop loss strategy should (possibly) be reevaluated. <g>

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thank you my friend. I was thinking about the triangular relationship.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Thank you Chuck. Would it be possible to have the EA open a B/B/S & S/S/B at the same time and a re-entry when a set draw down  in pips occurs for the losing triangle?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi TxFxTrader,

The next version will let you put in six sets of three pairs along with what you want to do (BBS, SSB).   So, you could set the pairs the same for two sets with one set as BBS and the other as SSB.

Maybe not today, but for sure by tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
hi all, here's my opinion,

as jeuro said this hedge is imperfect, it's true, no gain without fluctuation. however i think we couldn't merely say why don't trade only 0.07lo gbp/usd. hedge eliminates most risk for us also some profits, but at least we know what's the level we are now, i mean i will know the price is too high or too low, so that we can make descion to buy or sell. let me take EUR/CHF EUR/USD and USD/CHF for example, we can calculate the relationship for those three pairs, say we use one-dimensional linear regression equation. now we come up the resid for equation, of course we know the standard deveriation. now we see clearly wehther the price level(std dev) lies in the range. the entry point is when the resid goes out of the range and we leave when it back to range. for this strategy we could gain 80-100 pips. stop loss depends on account capital.

@ChuckNZ

Hey Chuck,

Thanks for the EA. I'm running it on my demo account right now to check it out, but it doesn't seem to open any trades. Is the EA supposed to open trades right after activation (if spread is low enough)? Am I right if I open just 1 chart and add your EA to it? My currency symbols have a suffix, but that shouldn't be a problem, right? I'm also using a 5 decimal broker though. How's the EA dealing with that? I've tried to multiply pip settings by 10 to account for the 5 decimals, but without success. My spread is definitely not the problem as it's very tight and I've tried with using high maxspread values. In my mt4 options I have EA's enabled and allowed for live trading. Anything else I might be overlooking?

Grtz,

Koen.

Hi satfish.

The risk incurred is the risk incurred. If by making 3 trades you have a net  position of long GU 0.07, your risk/reward  is of 0.07 long GU.

If you trade only 0.07 GU long, your risk/reward is of 0.07 long GU.... exactly the same.  The cost of making 3 trades of 0.50 is about 22.50

and the cost of doing 1 trade of  0.07 is about  1.05. Plus  if the positions are kept for a while you also have the cost of  swaps.

I understand that good strategies can be figured out  from this triangles of pairs. But all the the details you mention....levels, regressions, equations, etc, can be calculated by just placing 3 horizontal lines in all 3 pairs in the current prices at one point on time. No need to spend money in spreads  for it.

J.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Sorry... the EA had a problem with symbol suffixes.   It should be fixed now.   I've also added the display of some useful information on the chart.

Best to attach the EA to EURUSD (or other active chart).   Timeframe doesn't matter.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Another udate for you.   FWIW (and I know there are those that think this whole thread is rubbish), the EA closed 23 trades in the last 24 hours.   Each trade, of course, is really three trades.    So, that's 69 trades.   MaxDD for any single trade has been around 20 pips.   It (almost) always has 21 trades on at one time (7 sets of three trades).   The default TP (for the set of three trades) is $100 per 1.0 lots.    You can set this to whatever you like.    So, 23 closed trades at $100 each.... you can do the math.

This new version lets YOU set the symbols for the pairs you wish to trade.   Do not add the suffix.  The EA will take care of that for you.

You can trade between one and seven sets of three pairs.   You need to choose your pairs carefully to maintain the (almost) hedge.

For each set (of three pairs), you can set the trading mode to BBS or SSB.

If you leave the trading mode blank, that set won't be traded.

So, if you only want to trade one set (of three pairs), you will set the trading mode for the others to blank.

"BBS" and/or "SSB" need to be upper case.

Of course, I could modify the EA to cater for more than seven sets.   But, it's easy to run multiple copies of the EA.   I'm now running the EA on 11 live accounts for clients plus four of my own.

It's important that you set MaxSpread fairly tight for each set.   The screen display will guide you for setting MaxSpread in the future.   The tighter you set MaxSpread, the quicker the trade will reach the TP, but the fewer trades.   Don't be greedy.

Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Since I have uploaded the source, you will neet my version of the OrderReliableLibrary (attached).   Just put the library in your "include" folder.

Sorry I didn't include the library with my earlier post.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Another update for you.... EA and OrderReliable library this time.

I have added the ability to pause trading in any set after closing with profit.   I just felt that it was silly to close three pairs that were (net) in profit and then turn right around and re-enter those positions.   Why not let the market settle into the current ratios for a while?

In any event, you can turn this feature on or off to suit yourself.

To enable this feature, set PauseAfterClose to true.   To turn it off, set it to false.

If you want to suspend trading with that set for (say) 15 minutes, set PauseMinutes = 15.

The EA has been fairly quiet in the last three hours or so.

Good trading!

--- 帖子 #564 ---
nice work there.

it seems like there could possibly be an advantage in having both BBS and SSB running simultaneously because one will go into profit while the other would be at the other end of the bell curve in loss territory, then the two ebb opposite directions and the other would drift into profit. right? wouldnt it double your profit to have BBS and SSB running simultaneously?

would it be worthwhile to add the option to open an opposite BBS or SSB order upon take profit to take advantage of the ebb and flow being the natural trigger for the opposite direction BBS/SSB? while still allowing the current direction to keep going forward with its BBS direction?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Another upgrade.... as a result of a lot of private emails.

This version (008) lets you control how many sets you want to trade.

Let's say you only have enough money (or courage) to trade two sets (six positions).    Up until this version, you had to select two sets (three pairs each) that you wanted to trade and then wait until the spread on each of those sets was narrow enough to trade.

NOW... you can set up all seven sets ready to go with seven times three pairs.   Then, set MaxSets=2 (or whatever) and it will only trade two sets.

Which two sets, you might ask?

The first two sets where the spread on all three pairs is less than MaxSpread for those pairs.

Now... we are beginning to get some power in this EA.

Still not many trades in the last four hours or so.   But "few trades" is better than "some losses".

I also have had a few private emails asking me why I'm sharing all of this with the forum.   The answer.... "because I can".

All the best!

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi Chuck,

Great work! I'll try the last version right away, but still would like to know how the EA is dealing with 5 decimals. Does it automatically detect if there's 5 decimals or do I have to account for it myself in the settings.

Thanks!

K.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I agree with this Chuck. What do think about this?

--- 帖子 #568 ---
You an do this (same pairs, BBS and SSB) without me....

In fact, there is already an example set up in the default parameters.

See the first and last set.... they are the same pairs.... but one is BBS and the other is SSB.

With the latest version.... you can just about do whatever you like.

The EA is generating a few more trades now.... must be the Asians moving things around a bit.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Well.... any EA should take care of 3, 4 and 5-digit pairs automatically.  I would hate to think that this one doesn't.   It takes care of JPY (3-digit) mixed in with 4 and 5-digit pairs.

But.... let me know if I have failed to do the job properly and I'll fix it.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
what about this, if you only used each pair twice (one buy and one sell) in the trade window and if any combination of 3 specified pairs (could be all the hedge pairs you can add up for your broker) came to profit, then you cash those 3 in and then re open them to keep the ring intact. what do you think?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
i meant the timing of opening the orders. the way it is now it re-opens the same direction but at a point of exhaustion or climax and seems like it promotes drawdown. it seems it would be the ideal time to open an order in the opposite direction right? rather than soaking in drawdown by reopening orders at the end of the phase. I think the paus/sleep helps but if you order opposite it could skip the whole phase of drawdown leading up to this point where the ebb will start to go back the opposite bbs/ssb direction right?

also  what do you think about a profitlock trail stop to pull in more on top of the 1.00, such as at $1.00 lock .50, but let it go to $2.00 and lock $1.50;  $3.00 locks $2.50 etc.

what do you think?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Sorry.... I don't know your name.

Using your words.... "the way it is now, it opens BBS and SSB for the same pairs at the same time".   Well, not exactly the same time.   That's not possible.   But, assuming that the spreads are acceptable by the time the EA gets to the second set, both sets get done near enough to the same prices.  I just watched the EA open BBS and SSB (almost) at the same time for the same three pairs.   I assume that's what you are talking about?   You can drive the EA any way you wish.  Just make (as I have already done as default) a BBS and SSB entry for the same pairs.   Both sets will get done!    You can shut down the other five sets, if you wish.

Good idea on the trailing stop / profit lock idea.  I'm a big fan of trailing stops and have about 32 ways of doing it.   I'll put it on my TO DO list.  You know by know that things don't hang around on that list for very long.

The most unfortunate thing with mutli-pair systems (like this) is that they can't be backtested.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
yes thats what im talking about.

so what youre saying is that it doesnt matter whether you wait to open an order in the opposite BBS direction because both a BBS and a SSB will arrive into profit at about the same time and theres not an "opposite schedule" that one arrives in profit and then hours later the other arrives in profit like the ebb and flow of high tide, although it does seem to me like it is the case that when a BBS takes profit that opening the opposite SSB would be the right timing

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Chuck hi its Brian again. i just tested my theory by opening a.1 lot for  EJ CHJ ECH  BSS and SBB on different accounts at about -$10.00 each.

It appears that they are opposite and as one fluctuates up the other profit fluctuates down.

right now one is at - $7.00 and the other is at -$11.00. i ll check back after work and see how my experiment went.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
quick update from my smartphone, the bss is at -$14 and the sbb is at -$3.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I sure don't!

I don't use MT4 much, but I'll DL your EA and give it a try. Thanks for putting the time in for the EA.  The key to this type of hedge is to unhedge it in the traders favor.  I've been running one manually for the past several months with multiple triangles, but recently dropped down to one triangle so I could focus on how they cycle and how to correctly(most of the time, ha) speculate the combined direction for the triangle.  It does work despite those who as you have put, think this thread rubbish.

Chuck, not sure if you know this but for those in the USA you will not be able to open BBS and SSB on the same pair simultaneously, thanks to the NFA, and agencies who are trying to protect us.  There are Non-US brokers which do accept US clients that do allow that type of hedging.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
update, the sbb is at $1 profit and the bss is at -18.00

Hi Brian and others.   A small request first.   Thanks, Brian, for letting me know your name.   I have a problem addressing someone as "xyztrader" or similar.  As to my request, I think it would be a nice touch if people put their names (even a fake name, if necessary) at the end their posts.   Mine should be obvous (it's not NZ) from my user name.   Just a small request.... I won't waste your time mentioning it again.

I hope anyone trialing TriangularHedge is making money.   I have a new version (that I'll post later) that has the ability to trade eight sets.  But, I have set MaxSets to 5.   That means that it will only have five sets on the go at once.   The beauty of this approach is as follows.  Trading of a particular set is paused for 10 minutes (or whatever you have set PauseMinutes to).   While that set is paused, the EA will select another set to replace it, in order to keep the number of open sets at MaxSets.

The EA, with those settings, was like a cash register while I slept.   Since it had some new "stuff" in it, I was only running it on six live accounts.  But, they all went up by at least 3% overnight with a dozen closed sets.

Speaking of "sets"... I think I finally have my head around what to call sets and trades.  Their are three trades (or positions) in each set.   That helps me (at least) to differentiate between trades and sets when writing about this EA.

While sleeping... I noodled around a new idea for this EA in my head.   When implemented, it will significantly reduce the time it takes to reach TP.  I tested the idea when I got up using a simpler EA and it will really improve performance.   Now, to implement it in TriangularHedge.   Which my farming chores to get done as well, this change could take most of today to code and test.

Thanks to whoever it was that mentioned that you can't be long and short the same pair with U.S. brokers.   I knew that, but had overlooked it with this EA.  Some non-US broker also enfore FIFO rules, so you will need to be careful of that as well.   I can add some code to enforce those rules.  The EA can have up to eight sets to choose from, but not put trades that would violate NFA rules if "NoHedge" and/or "FIFOonly" are true.

Good trading.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I have been backtesting this type of multi-pairs for a long time.

Sorry but I have to repeat that by trading a BSS , a SSB or both, it does not make money.

Using equal lots, the hedge is imperfect, therefore you are trading a small un-balance portion of the trio.

Profit or losses come from that.

If you trade both ways, your are fully hedge, pay a lot of spredas and makes/loss nothing after that.

If you trade both and close one leg once in profits and wait for the other to retrace, it would be

the same to do it with the small portion of ONE pair and save a lot of spread.

J.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
The statement about the US clients able to hedge is not true. There is a least one broker & bank that allow this.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I agree with this, however, a believe with a 3 pair ring that it will only move so far in pips establishing a trading range unlike trading 1 pair were it could move a substantial amount. I downloaded some price data on 3 pairs and plan to crunch some numbers over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Please post a detailed report. I have a very small profit in closed trades since yesterday.

Then it is my understanding that they are breaking the law.  Would you mind disclosing those entities?  I'm not defending or an advocate the NFA or CFCT, just curious.  Because I was in a fund whose broker closed the mgr down citing NFA and CFCT violations.  PM me with the info.

Rich

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I'd like more info on setting it up as well.  As I had mentioned in an earlier post, I typically don't use MT4 nor it's EAs.  So I'm sure I'm not doing something to set it up properly.  I did load it, compile etc.  It's been running most of the day, but have not had any trades open or close.

Initially I only want to use the EU GB US trio, so do I manually go into the .mq4 file change the current set1 to these three then compile again?

Rich

Edited later.  For some reason the EA was getting removed from the charts, so I'm not sure how long today it's actually been running.  I opened charts for GB CH US and they have been sticking in the charts, so I'll let it run over night.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Sorry... some times I forget to mention things that are obvious to me and, perhaps, not obvious to others.

1.  If you run this EA, I strongly suggest that you run it on a EURUSD chart, as that pair is usually the most active.  Timeframe DOES NOT matter.  You only need to have one chart open.

2.  You need to have all possible pairs that this EA is going to trade appearing in the MarketWatch list.

3.  You may need to increase MaxSpread for each set, depending on your broker.   The EA displays the maximum spreads it is seeing for each set.  That will guide you in setting MaxSpread.   Of course, spreads vary during the day, depending on which markets are open and which markets each broker caters to.

I'm testing the version with "SmartEntry" now.   The positions it takes are doing much better than trading without this new feature.   I will release the latest version later today.... when I know it is rock solid.

As for people who say this approach can't make money, I don't really wish to debate it.    Sets only get closed when they are in profit by $100 per full lot.   It's Wednesday here and, since Monday, it's closed 42 sets, all in profit.   I currently have a MaxDD of 35 pips for five sets.   The EA just relies on the pairs in each set wandering up and down.   Drawdowns (per set) have not exceeded 15 pips (once I got all the bugs out).   I remain sceptical, but can't argue with results.    Rather than shoot holes in the concept, try it.    If it doesn't make money for you, I'll refund twice the cost of the EA.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hey no problem Chuck.  I do the same.

I had done 1 and 2.  I changed the MaxSpread to 5, Sets to 2.  Changed verbose to true., then saved the *.set

Where does the EA display the spread?  I've just been eye-ballin' it from the MW window.

Rich

--- 帖子 #587 ---
The EA displays a lot of info (using Comment function) in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.   It shows this for all eight sets, even if you aren't trading them all.   Part of the display is the worst spread for each set.

If you aren't getting this display, there may be some clues in the expert log?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Yeah, I didn't have the EA comment turned on.  Turned off the confirmation so it's running on auto.  Thanks Chuck!

I downloaded version .008 but it won't go on my charts. I also downlaoded the dll for the librairies folder. Has he taken it away? Thanks, Paris

No such thing as "won't go on the charts".    What does that mean?

There is no "DLL".    There's a library file (OrderReliable_120204) that goes in the "include" folder.... not the library folder.

Is there a mathematician amongst you who can give me a hand with something to do with this EA?   Someone who really understands the relationships between pair pricing?    If so, could you PM me so we can then have a chat via email?

I have worked out how to be a bit more clever about when to enter these trades, but I'm not convinced that I've got it right.  Plus, you may be able to steer me in a better direction?

My method appears to be working, but....

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I started with the EA about 10 hours ago. So far it's closed 1 set with .10 lot sizes there's about an $85 float so far. Paris

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi txTrader.

It does not matter how many numbers you crush.

Take a look at my post #545 and 548 and FXEZ post #554.

The fact is:  Your  are entering 3 trades with 0.50 each, but in reality you are trading 1 pair by 0.07.

if that "1" pair moves 500 pips in favor, you make aprox. $350 .

If that "1" pair moves 500 against you, You loss aprx $350

There is no magic in the number. My point is that if you are trading 0.07 in 1 pair,,, why pay the spreads

of 1.50 lots???

You don't need to download any data. Just pick the prices any time from the past (has to be in same tick, for example

choose the price of the close of one specific  candle for all 3 pairs.  From there, calculate how much you would have in profit or losss at current prices.

J.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hey,

Letting the EA run overnight using 50K lots and 7 sets my 50K demo acct. balance is up ~$700.  Presently my float is -1%.

Rich

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Almost guarantee that 1 or more of your sets is either missing a pair or entered the wrong way.

Not quite likely that 7 sets X 0.50 in each pair  can produce that much profit/loss in 1 night.

You should have 21 trades right?

J.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
On a $3000 demo account using .10 lots I've now closed 4 sets but the float is getting bigger and bigger. Now the float is about $147.

The problem is with the GBP/JPY pair now down  more than 70 pips from that set. that's probably a good set to exclude. Paris

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Ok, Ill now concede that the EA needs a SL.   I just manually shut down a set in each account that had a DD of $400 (for the set of three positions).   I didn't like the look of it, so just pulled the plug on that set.   Still up over $4,000 per account since Monday, so adding a SL doesn't concern me.

I envisage a simple SL of so many dollars (per full lot) for each set.    I'm thinking $200.  Of course, it will be a parameter.   But any thoughts on where to set it initially?

The losing set had JPY in it.   Pairs with JPY in them are not included in my new SmartEntry algorithm (too hard to get my head around it).

There are two members of this group helping me with the SmartEntry logic, so I hope to release it later today, certainly before Monday.  I think the additional logic is helping, but waiting to hear from them as to whether it makes any sense.

I'm guessing that no SmartEntry logic would have prevented the large DD for the particular set that beat me up today.

I do have some logic in other EA's that keeps me out of currencies (not pairs) when they are the strongest or weakest out of eight.   That would have kept me out of any JPY trades in the last 24 hours and EUR trades for the last 12 hours.   But that would probably mean very few trades.

Be careful out there.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Question for Chuck. Will the EA continue to manage trades when we come back from the weekend and the market's been closed for a couple of days?

Or will we have to close them manually? How is the smart entry Ea coming along. Thanks, Paris

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Sorry i didn't notice you made a post about the smart entry. Still even a $400 drawdown isno t that bad considering you've made $4000 on each account. Paris

Hi Chuck, nice to meet you. Thanks for all the work you have done on this system and building an EA and all. I have a couple questions about execution.

I started this EA on 3 MT4 platforms. All non-US. On 1 (smarttradefx), it opened all 7 trade sets right away. on another (fxvv), it opened 1 trade set and on the third (FXDD) it didn't open any. Everything is setup as it should be so i am wondering have you seen this on different brokers? Or is there something I am missing? BTW, they were all set-up and turned on within minutes of each other.

Cheers,

Len

--- 帖子 #603 ---
So, does the EA just open trades w/out regard to current direction?  Does it take into consideration current direction?  If so, how does it determine that direction?  Does it do any correlation?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi Len and thanks for signing your post.

I'm fairly certain that you will find the spreads to be the cause of no (or few) trades on some accounts.   It's a bit of a dilemma.   If you widen the spreads so that the EA will trade for other brokers, you are less likely to see those trades go into profit.   The value of the three-trade open position doesn't vary that much.   I think we are lucky to get a 10-pip profit ($100 per full lot) out of these trades when we have a 2-pip or less spread on each pair.   If the spread goes out by two more pips, your chances of seeing a profit diminish.

There are others here with more experience trading three pairs.   But, IMO, it's important to grab your profit and run before a trend (probably against you) can develop.

I have manually closed a few sets (four) where I didn't think they would reach the 10-pip profit.   This makes me think that we should lower the TP after so many hours.    I'll add that to my TO DO list, as an option of course.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Chuck and thanks for the prompt reply. Yes, spread could be the issue. I left it at default and will continue to do so as the account it did open all sets was my main account. So it's all good. I have disabled all yen cross sets now as well as I saw from you, Yen may be an issue. Indeed, Yen crosses do not act like other pairs.

Thanks again,

Len

Yes, Paris, the EA will keep track of things over the weekend.   If you should stop it, or your PC crashes, whatever, it will take over management again whenever you start it (like any good EA).

I will also add a feature that I have in most of my other EA's.   Late on Thursday or early Friday, I like to set a switch (a global variable) that will tell my EA's to stop taking new trades.   They will continue to monitor and close trades, but no new trades are taken.

I will be adding this functionality before Monday, maybe by tomorrow morning (USA) time.   It's pretty easy.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
How can the EA consider "current direction"?   Current direction of what?   Each set has three pairs.   We are either buying, buying, selling or selling, selling, buying.    If you can pick the direction of three pairs, you'll make a fortune.

No, the EA doesn't do any correlation.   Basically, it opens three trades per set.   End of story.   The pairs, of course, are selected such that you are "almost" hedged.   Choose the pairs wrong or have the BBS/SSB wrong way around and you can lose money quickly.  I already found that out before I got my head around pair selection.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Just a thought Chuck. I have seen other EA's that have the option to do an emergency "Close All Trades" Is this an option to consider?

Cheers,

Len

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hi Len,

While most of us have EA's or scripts that perform that function (close all trades), I'm quite happy to add that functionality to this EA.

I'm trying to track a cosmetic bug that is driving me nuts.... time for another cup of coffee.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
LOL, coffee, beer or a Ceaser will fix any bug. Another thought to that close all trades option maybe is, disable EA when close all trades is activated. That will keep the EA from opening new trades right away.

Good luck with the bug.....

--- 帖子 #611 ---
The coffee worked!!   Here is the latest version for you... complete with "SmartEntry".   I've gone over the logic carefully and it seems sound to me.

The changes include:

1.  You can trade up to ten sets (previously eight).

2.  You can limit the number of active sets using MaxSets.

3.  I run with all ten sets enabled, but MaxSets set at seven (7).

4.  I don't have time to explain SmartEntry right now, so try it on demo accounts first.

5.  I managed to make a simple change so that SmartEntry even works on JPY pairs.

6.  It will send you an email every hour with lots of information, unless you set SendSummaryEmails to false.

EX4 only at this point.

You can turn off SmartEntry, if you prefer not to use it.

With SmartEntry turned on, it could take 30 minutes to initiate any trades, even longer when there isn't much action.

Have fun!

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Awesome, thanks Chuck. so are you using this with default settings?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I always set default lot size to 0.01 lots in all of my EA's.... as I wouldn't want a user of one of my EA's getting a SHOCK.  But, I'm running with 1.0 lots in my live accounts.

I'm also running with MaxSets = 7.

Otherwise, I run with the defaults that I put into the EA.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
OK, thank you

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Sorry Chuck, one more question.....until there's another....

When i unload a previous version and load up the new one, does it take over where the old one left off? or do i need to close all trades and let the new one start over?

Thanks,

Len

--- 帖子 #616 ---
All of my EA's (including this one) should automatically upgrade with no problems.   This particular upgrade, however, could be a problem if you changed any of the symbols.   I changed the names of the symbols from "SymbolA" to "Symbol011", for instance.   Otherwise, you should be good to go..

Let me know how you get on.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
hello chuck~

I have question.

I wonder why it doesn't open seperately?

While EG, GU,EU are being opened,

On next set(GU,UJ,GJ), only UJ, GJ are being opened.

Is it normal??

and one more question is how to set the max spread??

sorry my english is very bad.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
No problem with the English.

1.  I don't know why GU didn't open.  Are there any error messages in the expert journal to tell us about it?

2.  Only you will know how to set MaxSpread for your broker.    The display on the chart will give you some assistance on setting MaxSpread.  The problem is that the spread changes during the day.   I try to keep MaxSpread just below the typical spread at the time.   I hope that helps?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Thank you for replying.

I am using the MT4

on the Jounal, it say that "GBPUSDpro opening at 0.00000 sl: 0.00000 tp: 0.00000 failed [Hedge is prohibited]"

and EURGBP has same problem.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Ah ha.... this is an easy problem.   Your broker doesn't allow hedging.    You will have to change brokers or give up on this EA.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
If you are running with TriangularHedge_016 and not getting any (or many) trades, you have a couple of choices:

1.  Set SmartEntry to false;

2.  Set SmartEntryAddOn to 0.00010 (first).  If that doesn't work, set it to zero (0.0).

This aspect is still a bit experimental and I need to watch it for the next 12 hours to come up with the right settings.

It's unfortunate that this EA cannot be backtested, leaving me to fly a bit blind.

Tomorrow, I'll post a version that will let you tell the EA to stop taking new trades (for the weekend), if you wish to use that feature.

All the best from downunder.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Another thing we can try is have each pair with BBS and then SSB for each pair so that would give us about 16 choices. Then just use Smart Entry to choose the best entry, but this would give us more opportunity. What do you think? Paris

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Awesome, thanks Chuck. I didn't change anything so it should be OK,

Thanks, Len

--- 帖子 #624 ---
You can use FinFx as a broker for U.S. customers.

They have a triple A plus credit rating and are from Finland.

They accept all USA customers and you can trade Gold as well.

You can hedge, no FIFO and you can scalp too. Paris

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Chuck,

Have you look at when the trade(3 pairs) was taken, when it closed, and how long it usually took to close with TP $1.00?

I have just set the EA to work and it has opened 4 sets.

Thanks.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi Bruce,

Like you, I think that information would be very useful.    I've just been too busy getting the EA to function properly.   Hope to have the "stop trading" working today.... if my wife doesn't give me to me things to do!!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
New version for you.

This one lets you change MaxSets on the fly.   I decided that is the easiest way to stop new trades from taking place.  This feature has other benefits as well.

1.  If, for any reason, you want to change MaxSets, just click on "Tools" and "Global Variables".   If MaxSets is already there, you can change the value to any number between zero and ten.   If it's not already there, you can create an entry and then set the value to be between zero and ten.

2.  If you want to stop the EA from taking new trades (late Friday, for instance), just follow the steps in #1 above, setting MaxSets to zero.

3.  If you stop and start the EA, the global variable will be deleted and the EA will use whatever you have set for MaxSets in the parameters.

4.  You can only use "maxsets" or "MaxSets", so be careful typing.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
New version with StopLoss.   Do I need to apologise for taking up so much space here?

This version includes the ability to force a stop loss for any set.

1.  To use it, set StopLossFullLot to the dollar equivalent for a full lot where you want to place the stop loss for a set.

2.  Example:  If you set StopLossFullLot to $300 and you are trading 1.0 lots, a set (of three trades) will be closed if the net loss for the set touches or exceeds $300.    If you set it to $300 and you are trading 0.01 lots, a set will be closed if the net loss for the set touches or exceeds $3.00.

3.  To prevent any accidental closing of existing positions, I have set the default for StopLossFullLot at $99999.  If you want to use this feature, be sure to change the value to a setting that makes sense.

4.  FWIW, I'm running with StopLossFullLot set at $300 until I get a feel for how often it gets hit.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Chuck,

Thanks for the updated EA.

Since starting about 9 hours ago the EA has closed 3 $1.00 Sets with 7 Sets now running at -$6.00.

A possible consideration for your TO LIST.  In the display you have max profit = -0.00, would it be possible to add a max DD = -00.00, so that we can see what DD had been for the Set?

Thanks.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Thanks, Bruce.

MaxDD (as a display) has been on my TO DO list.  I was just waiting for someone to ask for it.   The info displayed on the chart is getting "busy".

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Chuck,

thanks for the EA. I started running it about 12 hours ago and it has closed 2 sets, and I still have 7 sets running.

I know you mentioned the spreads in an earlier post, could you clarify something for me please?

Currently, max. spread (default) = 2.9  Does this mean that with smart entry set to True, that the spread on each individual pair within a set has to be less than 2.9 before a set will be entered?

I am looking to open another account and am looking at spreads / brokers etc. Any recommendations?

Thanks again.

Paul

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Good Job Chuck, thanks. when i set it to 300 is closed 1 set right away. That was to tight for me so i set it at 600.

Cheers....

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I hope the EA makes a lot of money for you.

MaxSpread comes into play with or without using SmartEntry.    It won't trade a set if ANY of the three pairs has a spread greater than MaxSpread.  While you can get more trades by increasing MaxSpread, the probability of making a profit is reduced.

As for brokers, I like Armada, HotForex, ThinkForex, FinFX, Pepperstone, to name a few.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I could use some help.

A couple of members of this group posted something like this:

Buy 1.0 aaabbb

Buy 1.0 bbbccc

Sell 1.0 aaaccc

This resulted in a net long (or short) x.xx lots of bbbccc

Something to that effect.

1.  Can someone show me how they calculate this?

2.  Is all of the information needed to do the calculation available to an EA?

3.  Could someone write a function for me that would do the calculation.

I want to do something "clever" to TriangularHedge using this information... basically filtering out some trades or going in the opposite direction.

Of course, I will post any upgrades to the EA here.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Another update....

This version (19) includes:

1.  Shows MaxDD for each set on the chart.

2.  Pauses after a SL.... similar to the pause after a TP.

3.  Not pausing after a SL makes no sense.   Why would you quit a losing position with a loss, only to immediately re-enter?

4.  FWIW, I am running with the defaults of pausing 10 minutes after taking profit and 30 minutes after being stopped out.

5.  If you are running with MaxSets < 10, another set will most likely have taken the place of the closed set anyway.

I will soon have to write a manual for this system.   Perhaps a couple more versions from now or over the weekend... whichever happens first.

Sorry Chuck, cant help with that as i'm not a coder but it does look like a b c d pattern trading

I am a big believer that one should be able to hedge his positions, if he so desires to. The problem is you have to find a unique way to do this in the US, but it's still possible.

To calculate you need to know the prices of the 3 in same tick.

Current Prices are  Eur/usd 1,29476, gbp/usd 1.52053 and eur/gbp 0,85147

Buying  100 000 Pounds (buy gbp/usd) will get you    +100 000 pounds and and a debt of  -152 053 usd

Buying  100 000  Euros (buy eur/gbp   will get you     +100 000 euros and a debt of -85 147 pounds

selling   100 000 euros  (sell eur/usd) will get you      + 129 476 usd and a debt of  -100 000 euros

To have  a "perfect hedge"  one would need to match 1 per one what we own and what we owe.

But is this case we do not.

We own 100 000 pounds and we have a debt of -85 147 pounds...  we own an extra + 14853 pounds

We own +100 000 euros and we have a debt of -100 000 euros... here we are ok

We own 129 476 usd  and we have a debt of -152 053 usd ...  we have an extra debt of 22 577 usd

So it is obvious that our equity would be affected by the price of the gbp/usd  as if we had a long

for 0,1483 lot

Sorry the example is not pure mathematical but it is the accounting aproach to investing in currencies.

Hello ChuckNZ,

I think your great work ... but I think you could improve the entry, change the system spreads. Currently if I understand the method of calculation is that speads the spread of each pair must be less than the amount chosen to open three positions.

example:

spread 2.9

usd / chf 02.09

GBPCHF 2.3

gbpusd 1.8

total 7.0

I think it would be more profitable to modify the conditions of entry by accumulating the sum of the three spreads less than the amount chosen.

spread 2.9

usd / chf 0.7

GBPCHF 1.1

gbpusd 1.1

total 2.9

that many provoquerais moin input, but released much faster, according to its brokers.

Sorry for my English, because I am in France and uses the translator ....

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hello Milou and thanks for your comments.   I agree with you 100%... with the benefit of hindsight.   It will be a simple change and I'm sure it's a change for the better.    When I change it, however, I will make it optional for those who have finally mastered an understanding of the earlier versions.

I haven't (yet) explained what the EA is doing with SmartEntry.   I will do that over the weekend.   It is possible, using SmartEntry, that checking the spread isn't even important.  I'll explain that later too.

In the mean time, I will change the EA to use a combined spread filter.

Thanks again for pushing me along.

ChuckNZ,

Since I started this EA it has the following results;

SETS                    opened     closed

usdjpy/audusd/audjpy                   1              0

gbpusd/usdchf/gbpchf                   4              3

eurchf/chfjpy/eurjpy                      1              0

eurusd/usdchf/eurchf                     1              0

eurgbp/gbpusd/eurusd                   1              0

gbpusd/usdjpy/gbpjpy                   5               4

eurusd/usdjpy/eurjpy                    3               2

Only three "Tri-pairs" seem to reach TP....gbpusd/usdchf/gbpchf   gbpusd/usdjpy/gbpjpy   eurusd/usdjpy/eurjpy

Is this the case with your results too?

Bruce

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Thanks, Jeuro, for taking the time to explain this to me.   I just wish that I wasn't exhausted from no sleep for several days while working on this EA.

I understand everything up to where you say that the above BBS deal is essentially long GBPUSD.    I get the USD22,577 and the GBP14,854.   But, I don't understand the 0.01483 lots.

In any event, what I really want to know... and you have answered that for me.... is which pair we are exposed to.... in this case GBPUSD and which direction (long).

What I plan on doing is deciding whether to use BBS or SSB, based on that exposure and using different methods of predicting the direction of the exposed pair.    I've code the function to do the calcs you provided above and I'm tesing it now.    As I said, it would help if I didn't fall asleep in the middle of typing!!

Will have a new version by Monday which will be an attempt at predicting the direction of the exposed pair.

Can you confirm that a movement of any consequence in the value of the set can only be attributable to the pair with unbalanced exposure?

If you have any suggestions for predicting the direction, feel free to make suggestions.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hi Bruce,

I have similar results with TP reached on gbpusd/usdchf/gbpchf 2 times, gbpusd/usdjpy/gbpjpy 4 times.

I also had stop loss set at 300 and was stopped out on gbpusd/usdjpy/gbpjpy once.

Paul

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi Chuck,

Jeuro is referring to the residual 14,853 GBP that is found in this line:

So 14,853 / 100,000 = 0.14853 lots of GBPUSD.

If you open up the same size at the same time on the ring previously specified, you effectively get GU long based on the pairs chosen and the respective prices / exposure.

1) If you change size, you can change net exposure. There are an infinite number of different net exposures you can develop but only one true hedge that is stationary, aka triangular hedge, impeccable hedge, perfect hedge or triangular arbitrage, where all exposures net out to zero.

2) If you stagger time of opening (or closing) each pair, you change the P&L dynamics (but not net exposure).

If you have a net exposure to GU as described above, and open and close all positions on the 3 pairs at once, your P&L is totally driven from the net exposure. In this case the net exposure is GU long. Simultaneously opening and closing all 3 positions severely limits the tools available to you. You are effectively left with only #1 to manage your net exposure but no way to alter the P&L dynamics through your strategy. If you are perfectly hedged and open and close all positions simultaneously, you simply eat spread each time with no chance for directional movement.

IMO #2 is the more accessible approach (changing time of opening/closing each pair) due to minimum size for rounding purposes offered through most MT4 brokers. But, if you can effectively hedge out most of the directional currency risk through evening out the net currency exposure (#1), then you are left with the interesting P&L dynamics you have created via staggered (#2) entry / exit times = financial engineering with no need to predict direction!

For ideas to change the P&L dynamics of the hedge, STUDY this post then read forward a few posts (down to post # 491) and then skip over to Three pairs hedging/Renko, particularly the posts by jeuro who shares a few more tidbits on the original idea before he goes dark.

I prefer not to post my name on these boards for privacy, but since it's already out there on the web, for you Chuck I'm Patrick.

By the way I have taken a cursory look into the concept posted by jeuro and can confirm after spending an evening or three doing some simulations in R that there is "something there". Unfortunately I haven't had time to fully explore or even implement the concept due to all the projects that I must finish first, but it is definitely on the "to do" list.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Thanks for the detailed explanation FXEZ

Yes, I confirm the profit or loss in equity comes only from the unbalance exposure. There is no magic in placing

3 trades simultaneously. It is only math.

No, I don't have any "regular" suggestion for predicting the direction. That is the eternal quest of us traders.

The only suggestion is stated in that one old post of mine when I started to look for ways of back testing certain concepts.

I know (in a mathematical form) what the price will be in the future of almost any pair. Transforming that knowledge

into a sensible strategy is the hard part.

The main purpose for  posting in this type of threads is to somehow prevent that traders/coders waist time and energy.

Specially like you Chuck, that are willing to roll up you sleeve and work hard at it.

I fully identify myself with the exhaustion and no sleeping. I still do the same once in a while.

J.

Hi Jeuro and thanks again,

I am testing a new version that calculates the net exposure and trades each set using BBS or SSB depending on whether it "thinks" the net exposure is going to go up or down.   It's working nicely (I have tick mill for weekend testing), but the indicator I'm using has an intermittent bug that is driving me crazy.   I've been on it for 21 hours, so may have some sleep which usually helps to solve these kinds of problems.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
The author of articles  1  and  2  does a very good job in explaining the arithmetic.

Rich

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Major upgrade attached. Important notes follow. Please don't use this new version without reading the following.

1. Thanks to a couple members of this group, I now (almost) understand that trading equal sizes of the three pairs in each set is only a parital hedge. All through this thread, they have been trying to get it across that:

a. Trading equal lot sizes is NOT going to provide a 100% hedge.

b. If it was a 100% hedge, there wouldn't be any potential to make (or lose) money.

c. Any profit (or loss) that we make is due purely to the movement of the residual exposure.

2. Early last week, Murphy's Law was good to anyone trading with this EA. It took dozens of trades that were all profitable. Towards the end of the week, the sets were slow to go into profit and/or are still sitting on DD.

3. I added something called "SmartEntry" that attempted to squeeze a couple of extra pips out of each set. For the most part, it helped. But, two pips isn't enough of an edge.

4. I now understand that trading equal-size lots has exposure to two currencies (not pairs). Long GBP and short USD (for instance).

5. Unless we add some logic to "predict" the direction of the remaining exposure, we have less than a 50/50 chance of making a profit (due to spreads).

6. So, this version is my first attempt at predicting the direction of our exposure in each set.

7. This new feature is activated by setting AutoDirection to true (the default setting).

8. When AutoDirection is set to true, an indicator (CurrencyStrength) is called. So, you will need to have that indicator in your indicator folder.

9. When AutoDirection is set to true, the EA will decide which of the following options to use for each set:

a. No trade (seldom happens).

b. Trade the set using BBS logic.

c. Trade the set using SSB logic.

10. When AutoDirection is set to true, each set will be using a different Magic number than the number used when it is set to false. So, for testing purposes, you can run two instances of the EA. One with AutoDirection set to true and the other set to false. This will tell you (and me) whether the new logic is beneficial.

11. Another important feature of this version is that the OrderComment field now shows the Set number (1-8) and the magic number. This is handy should you decide to quit trades in one set.

12. This version is now using EURGBP, GBPAUD, EURAUD for Set 7. The previous pairs were duplicated in Set 1. Set 1 and Set 7 were previously the same, one using BBS and the other using SSB.

13. Another member of this group has offered an indicator to me for trying as part of this automatic trend detection logic. I will be working with him (or her) as soon as I have another cuppa.

Since it's the weekend, I can't thoroughly test this version. I'm 99% confident, but suggest that you only trade it on demo accounts for the first few hours of trading on Monday (or Sunday for some of you). I will provide a quick update should there be any problems.

Good trading!!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
If you would like to help with this project, it would be HUGE if you could run two instances of this EA on a demo account for a couple of days this coming week.

Instance #1 with AutoDirection = true.

Instance #2 with AutoDirection = false.

Both on same account.   Both applied to a EURUSD M15 chart.    Both with the same parameters except for AutoDirection.

When the orders are closed, please have a look at the trades during the test to see which instance put on the trades and make a summry for each instance.

The magic numbers for AutoDirection = true will be between 82608 and 82626.

Magic numbers for AutoDirection = false will be between 12879 and 12896.

Please report any bugs or unexplained behaviour right away so I can fix it.

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Chuck,

Count me in...

I will set them up on FXDD and Pepperstone.

Both on same account.   Both applied to a EURUSD M15 chart.    Both with the same parameters except for AutoDirection. Everything else will be OOTB parameters.

No offense but there seems to be a real knowledge vacuum in this thread. In examples listed in the first post, there is no hedging being done. You are simply trading with an exposure equivalent to a single pair that is disproportionate to the volume traded. You use more margin, pay more in transaction costs and gain nothing.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Everyone here understands this. We get the mathematics. We understand it is basically trading 1 pair. What you and a couple of other people do not seem to get is this is an attempt to have a robot trade for people. One that has little draw down and will make money with little human intervention. That is the purpose of all Trading Robots. You can add logic, technical's and mathematics to a robot as has been done to all robots and I challenge you to show me one that will work year after year without blowing up an account. (BTW, i have seen a few that work for the creators in back tests and forward tests. but when tested by other people don't work)  I also looked back on your previous posts in other threads and see you have given no constructive advice or any strategies or systems for trading. I see nothing posted by you to indicate that you make money trading and you are not obligated to either. That said, you are also not obligated to criticize other peoples hard work to just give a negative comment (although that is your right). Whenever you come to someone with a problem you see, you should also come up with at least 1 solution for the problem. Can you do that? Maybe start a thread with your strategy or system that you make money with?

Cheers,

"Thanks" to anyone testing this EA.

I've only had one trade per instance (autodirection true and false) on all accounts (live and demo) so far.  It's interesting that one instance used BBS and the other used SSB for the same pair.  Due to the large spread, they both have a small open loss and the loss for the set on AutoDirection is smaller.... FWIW.   The trades were for set #5.

Spreads are quite wide, of course, for the first few hours of the trading week.

You may wish to turn off SmartEntry for this test.   It really slows down the order generation and may not be worth the effort.

The next version displays the settings for AutoDirection and SmartEntry to make life easier.

I also noticed that set #1 isn't being controlled by AutoDirection.   That, too, has been fixed in the next release.

Another trade just opened... on both instances....  for set #2.

And another for set #10.... and #4.   Spreads are narrowing.

Good trading!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Mine says set #7 is not being traded although i did nothing to change this. Is this a bug? Paris

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi Paris,

No... it's not a bug.... it's a feature.   I'm sure you only see that on the instance running with AutoDirection set to true?

It's basically saying that it doesn't have enough information to decide whether to use BBS or SSB.   That will change as the day progresses.   With EURUSD gapping down this morning, it will take a while for trends to be detectable.

I also just noticed that the OrderComment() field doesn't contain the set number and magic number that I meant to have working.   That, too, is fixed in the next release.

I'll probably have a new version posted here in three or four hours... just trying to incorporate as much as possible into the one release.

I couldn't test actual order generation over the weekend, so I missed a couple of things.

The EA has closed a couple of profitable trades on one of my brokers already.   One was using AutoDirection and the other was not.   Jury is out as to whether the trend detection indicator I'm using is adding value.   I'll need a few hundred trades to make that determination.

I'm also working on four different trend detection methods to build into the EA (all optional, of course).

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Chuck,

Option request;

For direction testing purposes, could there be an option for forced trade entry of the three pairs in a determined direction?

With that option, we can view the charts and see possible direction or trend and then force entry.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #660 ---
You already have that capability.    Just turn off AutoDirection and enter the symbols you want and BBS or SSB for that set.

I'm pretty well satisfied that all of my changes since yesterday's release are working properly.  I'll be posting an update within the hour.  Just making cosmetic changes now.

Nice little profits so far.   While the sample is entirely too small to call "statistically meaningful", the AutoDetection logic seems to be adding value.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Ok guys and gals.... an update for you. I'm including the indicator so people don't have to go hunting for it.

This update incorporates the following:

1. A display on the chart so you know if AutoDirection and/or SmartEntry are turned on.

2. Fixed a problem where AutoDirection wasn't working on Set #1.... don't ask!!

3. Fixed the OrderSend calls so that they now record the Set number and Magic number in the OrderComment() field.

4. General tidy-up of the screen display that I think you will appreciate.

If you use the default settings for AutoDirection, the EA is using 60 bars of M15 data to ascertain the trend of each currency (not pair). You can try different settings (CurrencyStrengthTimeframe and CurrencyStrengthPeriods), but these parameters can not be backtested. If you aren't aware, the MT4 strategy tester doesn't cater for multiple pairs.

Early days... but the instance running with AutoDirection turned on is outperforming the one where it is turned off on 12 live accounts and two demo accounts. Entirely too early... I shouldn't even mention it.... but it is good to see.

Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Actually I posted some advice in another thread about trading baskets of pairs that is probably relevant here too. You can have a basket with 3 currencies that isn't the same as a single pair. The idea is to get different sized exposures in each currency, for instance I can sell 1 GBPUSD and sell .5 USDCHF and end up with different exposures to each currency. The only reason I'm saying this is because it seems like the point of this thread and the aim of it's participants is to reduce risk, but the risk doesn't change when the exposures between the two currencies is equivalent.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
The only weird thing i see so far is that set 5 is trading both instances. The true side is SSB and the False is BBS. They were placed at the same time.

And the auto direction false places more trades. But that makes sense and you probably already know.

Good work Chuck....

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Right, thanks saussiche. Criticism is always welcome when some constructive feedback follows.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Chuck, on the true side as well, i have some sets that say N/A where BBS or SSB are supposed to be. Does that mean its undecided?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Actuall, not weird.    Set 5 in the two instances traded at the same time because the spread met the criteria at the same time.  The "false" side for set 5 is hard coded as SSB and always trades that way.   When AutoDirection is set to true, the EA decides whether to trade BBS or SSB.   If it traded the same with AutoDirection set to true or false, I would have wasted over 30 hours of coding time.

I've now collected quite a few closed trades, mostly with brokers with zero or low spreads.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
OK, i get it. Thanks Chuck...

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Yep.... undecided is the right word to describe the situation.   I'll explain more later.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Somewhat urgent upgrade.....

With AutoDirection set to true, you will have seen cases where some of the sets aren't being traded.  This happens when no discernable trend is in place (according to the indicator).

A problem arises when a set is already being traded when the trend switches to no trend.   This leaves that set such that it is no longer being monitored.   The EA may miss the opportunity to grab profits.

This is the first real bug and I apologise.   Hopefully, I'm the only one trading live accounts.   Of course, these trades don't really go very far one way or the other, so the bug may not have affected you.

I have attached the indicator again, even though it hasn't changed.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Me again,

In case you guys are wondering about trading n currencies to reduce risk by novel exposure (relative to XXX/YYY pairs) I've quickly implemented such a system on a new account and have a trade explorer linked for it. It is based on all major currencies.

http://www.forexfactory.com/saussiche#06

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Can you tell us more about this?    Is it something you are going to share with us?   Perhaps another thread?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
It's not really worth another thread. The example that I'm showing is a simple linear model that fits the currencies over the sample period, providing a spread with properties that make it desirable for trading. There are plenty of tools in the public domain for this type of thing, even some that are directly compatible with mt4 (I've seen one on the Russian mt4 site). It's a slightly different paradigm for trading than people are typically familiar with, but it's probably the most accessible and common type of quantitative strategy out there.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Disappointing rusults for me.   How about you?

After 24 hours and lots of trades, using AutoDirection has underperformed running without it.    Fewer profitable trades and higher drawdown with AutoDirection = true.    Perhaps I should consider using it in reverse?

Waiting to hear from others.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
On my live account I am only running true. Have had a couple sets close but not many. I will switch it to false and see how it does.

On my demo both true and false, only false has closed trades and taken new ones. True has taken two on version 23 and both are still open.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
I've closed 7 sets with auto set to true but i'm only shooting for 8 points instead of 10.

I have a $5000 account with 100 to 1 leverage and trading .12 lots. I've made $55.20 and have a $247 float with 9 sets active. Paris

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I have this running on 2 accounts.

Account 1 - auto direction = true, opened 2 sets, no TP, DD = 18 pips. Auto direction = false, 7 trades open. These trades were all open prior to the auto direction option being added, DD = 110 pips. 1 TP since market open this week.

Account 2 - Demo account running for 12 hours. no trades with auto direction = false ? And with auto direction = true, there is one pair ( not the whole set ) open, in profit 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Because why would you enter a BBS or SSB when, say, the 3 pairs are going BSB or BSF (F for flat)?  That makes no sense to me as to why you would open a trade w/out at least having the direction of 2 of the 3 pairs.  Without having some sort of idea, this thing won't ever be profitable in the long wrong.  Trend in the wrong direction on any of the 3 pairs and you can kiss your account good bye.

And what happens after you take the profit?  Do you get back in again in the same exact direction?  If so, see my comment on kissing your account good bye.

This strategy needs more direction.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
i have this on 4 accounts/ 2 brokers, similar results posted already. only a few trades closed, some closed negative, i guess from the lag.

i have it on 2 accounts since last night, one is autodirection and one not, both opened all 10 sets per account (smart-off), .1 lot, only autodirection closed one set for $10.

I have been lurking here and have not contributed in years and am running the generous EA and indicator recently provided by ChuckNZ. I am compelled to contribute to this excellent thread. Some colleagues alerted me to this thread and I appreciate the contributions here. Truly good people.

I find that labels would be helpful for the Currency Strength indicator to determine what the lines represent...maybe I am missing something and there are labels (maybe I need to assign colors in the inputs)...I will try and change the color of my background (can't peek at the code because it is an ex4 file)..

P.S. Generally I do not test ex.4 stuff...but arbitrage, correlations, baskets and such are a favorite past-time of mine over the years. Funny I no longer trade them as I do not trust retail so much.

Update -

Account 1 - I stopped EA as nothing is happening. Spreads ???

Account 2 - demo account with Armada Markets is going very well. ClsProf = 17 for AutoDirection = True, ClsProf = 10 for AutoDirection = false. That's total for the week. Drawdown at 150 pips.

Is any body having any success with this on live accounts (mini-lots ??) and if so with which brokers?

tests going well with very small gains and no loss.

autodirection and smart entry seem to degrade the performance of this ea.

Chuck, could you explain smart entry and autodirection in technical detail. what is it? how is it calculated?

i just set up new test on new broker with 4 accounts each with  different combo for all 10 sets :bbs, ssb, bsb, sbs, so thats 10 sets  per chart, or 30 orders per account. total 120 orders. problem is it takes quite an account balance on all 4 accounts to cover it but its just demo testing.

brian

--- 帖子 #696 ---
I have a "hint" for those trading the TriangularHedge EA.   The thought came to me while trying to get some sleep... something I don't do very often.

As you know, the EA trades ten sets and can make money as long as one of the currencies (usually EUR) doesn't take off on a strong trend.

But.... with a slight modification... the EA will keep a perfectly balanced basket of pairs.    It may only trade three or four sets in order to achieve the perfect balance.   If we add more sets, there will be more opportunities... more sets while still keeping things balanced.

I've been watching it trade for five trading days and it's perfectly balanced, with the drawdown at any time hovering around the cost of entry.   Say four sets, three trades each, equals 12 trades at 2 pips spread.   About 24 pips.   It hasn't varied by more than seven pips for five trading days, occassionally (ten times a day?) taking 10-pip profits as the net for each set wanders around.   The problem, of course, is re-balancing things after closing a set.   This is where more sets would help out.

Anyone follow this logic?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
when you say "if we add more sets, there will be more opportunities"  do you mean add more sets but to other instances of the EA, while allowing a max of 4 sets per ea?

Brian

--- 帖子 #698 ---
You can run ten sets per EA instance.   If you use AutoDirection = true, you can use an undocumented parameter called AddOn.   AddOn is a number (1000, 2000, whatever) that gets added to the Magic number so that each instance has its own range of Magic numbers.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Chuck,

I think the key still lies in using the strengths and weaknesses of the EUR,  USD, and JPY in choosing BBS or SSB of the Tri-Hedge of EURUSD, USDJPY, EURJPY.

So consideration of strength and weakness of the currencies and the timing of that entry is important.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #700 ---
That's EXACTLY what AutoDirection does.   Rather than trade BBS or SSB (as coded in the early versions), AutoDirection calls an indicator to determine strength and weakness of each currency (EUR, USD, JPY, etc.).   Using that information, it then decides whether to use BBS or SSB (or not trade that set for a while).

So, you are right and the logic is already there.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi Chuck I have sent you a pm about 3 days ago did you get it?

cheers

Ian

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Thanks to those of you you realised that my post #697 was total nonsense and you were polite enough not to tell me so.   It wasn't an April's Fool joke.  It was meant to be serious.   But, I now realise that it has nothing to do with reality.    Each of the sets are ALREADY in balance, except for a slight exposure to two currencies.    So, my trying to keep the total of all sets in balance was a waste of time.... at least the way that I did it.   If anything, I need to balance the residual exposure and I wasn't doing that.   As to why it performed as well as it did.... just luck that convinced me I was on the right path.

Back to the drawing board.... and just that much smarter as a result.

I can also say, with reasonable confidence, that the logic I added for AutoDirection was also suffering from the same naivety.

We'll get there in the end.   Where has the volatility gone?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
There wouldn't be any surprises if the trend is according to the balance of the RING.

Y.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
You are right.

In this case your net position is  short USD/JPY  0,00292 lot.

You recovered the spreads because the USD/JPY had a drop from  96.31 to 95.95  (36 pips)

But if you left the trades open until close, you are in the negative again as the USD/JPY went up to 97.50

The only way you would be in the positive is if the USD/JPY drop to  95.95 again.

J.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
if we calculate lot sizes that are closer to perfect balance, would that allow this system to avoid the major shifts in the market that cause the ring to tilt such as happened with JPY this week?

can the EA automatically calculate lot size for this or maybe we could just type in the lot sizes for each pair of the ring?

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi c3p0.

That is the fallacy of the system.

The more you adjust the lots, to a point that could be a perfect hedge. Then will be no profits nor loss ever.

No point in pay spreads for nothing.

If the lots are not perfectly balanced, then you are trading a small net position. But what is the point

to trade all 3 pairs when is cheaper to trade the net position by itself. That is the case of Johntan

he is trading short 0.00292 usd/yen. It is not possible to trade that lot in a mt4 broker, but if he want trade that small

he could get a nano account and he could. With better results because he would be saving spreads.

J.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Quite intuitive...I agree...

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Perhaps imbalances can be well...the dog wagging the tail? Maybe the condition of these rings and the pause between the entries could be indicative of where they are at in their circle. Let the market tell you where it is and perhaps where the probability or weight of the direction of the players. Your not looking for 100%...you just need enough to not cause attention to yourself when perfectly trading. There is no guessing with this sort of trading, but the cirlces within the various pair, eventhough they may be imbalanced can be indicative and be an aid to locate where the least resistance is. I predict that if this thread evolves there will be some discoveries made that you guys really should not know (because you will be quite dangerous)..

Remember in Forex there are the "haves" and the "have-nots". Be quiet and trade well in this Forex Fraud.

ES

P.S. I do not know how many of you guys know how valuable this tool that ChuckNZ has shared. But I thank him for it. It is not necessarily a trading EA...but it can be used as a tremendous tool for the real trading to commence. If a few upgrades are offered...well take the gift and shut up.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I used to trade alongside a trader who had several screens up. He was watching various pair combinations that he configured on his bloomy. He spent more time on those screens with meaningful wiggly lines than his trading screen. When he placed a trade he knew the direction 100% of the time. When to enter and when to exit optimally was the remaining battle.

Imagine that 50% of the work done...it is just to figure out how to get the most out of the "lack of resistance". (also pay attention to the opening of the equity markets throughout the world and where they want to take the direction. Hint: The rings will really be moving then.

One more thing and then I got to stop....Pay attention to the input "pause after profit"....try five hours...

Good trading to the community of Forex Gamblers. Maybe you can prove them wrong.

Of course you can't hedge all of your exposure and still make money. Unless we are talking about true arbitrage.

You can hedge relative to the statistical relationships between the pairs though.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I am new to hedging. I have some questions. Please anybody who can answer?

1. When we open three positions in three different pairs, do we have to attach EA on each chart or only one chart?

2. Which broker is good to offer reasonable spread?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #719 ---
where did everybody go? I thought this was coming together quite nicely....

--- 帖子 #720 ---
JPY had a major shift last week and it tilted all my rings to the point of no return, in fact to major unrecoverable floating loss. The EA needs a max spread option also or it buys when spread is 20 or more i think. Besides that the drawdown was a little too high for me, and if the EA buys "blind" at the wrong time (despite the currency strength indi) you end up with a bunch of rings spinning with no profit. I think Electric Savant indicated that this thread is a gift you can take plenty away from though thanks to all the awesome contributors. having said all that I am still staying tuned.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hi guys and gals,

I've put another 80 hours or so into the EA and hope to release it Monday or Tuesday.   There's only a certain amount of testing that I can do on weekends (without live data).   Whether all of this work has potential to make us money remains to be seen.  But, I'm happy to share the EA as we go.

Unfortunately, this isn't the only EA that I'm working on.... so development doesn't go as fast as I (or you) would like.

The new work on the EA is in the area of avoiding certain trades and/or quitting certain trades early, regardless of whether they are in profit or loss situation.

I have seen some questions along the lines of "why doesn't the EA have a check for maximum spread?".   Well.... it does... and always has done so.

More later...

--- 帖子 #722 ---
aha! i should have known that with your skill and expertise you would have addressed that. I just saw no indication that a max-spread was in effect. thanks.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
It more like....all the golddiggers bailed and only the serious folk are left.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
That is the point I was making in post #711.

You were short  in USD/JPY and went up past 98.00 .

Like I mentioned,  the 3 trades will not be in profit unless the usd/jpy drops below 95.95 egain.. and does not matter how the other 2

interact.

The max spread thing is not going to help the logic.

Chuck has worked hard to code this, but all come down to figure out the direction of the un-balance .. and that is on "1"  pair.

But trying to figure the direction of 1 pair  is the normal trading quest. And if anybody finds it... no point in trading the 3.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
As promised, here is an update to the EA I created for this thread  I am attaching a zip file containing the EA, an indicator and a DLL.  The DLL sends a fake tick to the EA once every second to make sure we don't miss opportunities in the pairs we are trading when ticks slow down in the chart pair.

I don't have the time right now to explain what's new in this version.   I've been running it on six demo accounts and six live accounts since the markets opened three hours ago.   The results look good, but we've been here before!!

Give it a whirl on demo only and we can discuss performance before I get into what's new.

Try it with the default parameters.

The EA goes in the experts folder, the indicator in the indicator folder and the DLL in the library folder.

Attache the EA to ANY chart, but EURUSD M15 is recommended.

This thread are golden   just tweak here and there, and I am sure you'll get profit! but the idea of hedge are basically by removing dangerous enviroment into reasonable risk! cause if I were fisherman why should  bother about excitement by fishing in the ocean! maybe one time I am lucky enough to get TUNA! but what if a whale struck my boat and risking my life! fishing in the ocean only GOD knows, what we'll got next time!  lol but if  we fishing on our backyard pools, I am sure we already know what we'll got, but of course we get no excitement and limitation of Fish

anyway thank you cash4u2 for this thread it really change my Trading POV. I really appreciates Good share and have a nice day to all

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I don't see the advantage. Sure, they can post mispriced quotes, but if the dealer is a cheater, then what is stopping it from cheating on the fills or worse on withdrawal? No, I think the answer to a cheating dealer was correctly deduced by the NORAD computer Joshua at the end of War Games and I think it applies in this case.

Ran the EA on PS demo this week with default settings. Only a very few wins but mostly losses.

Seems to close in losses.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Exactly the same for me

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Why would this work?

I thought this idea was dismissed many posts ago.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
I am still running the EA OOTB settings on PS demo again this week with default settings.

And still mostly all losses.

Any suggestions about adjusting the settings?

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Im trying all the settings with no SL, no direction, etc. Im entering the trades manually by watching 2 demo accounts one with bbs and one with ssb. when the account gets -50 profit i type BBS or SSB in Chuck's EA , and if minimum spread permits, it will open the set. if profit decreases by$10 or $20 then add a set. i just have not seen it close yet so if it does then ill tell you.

possible ways to close-

1. a single set T/P per individual set (current method)

2. global close TP (of multiple sets of same pairs or correlating pairs and close when all are in profit)

3. single set trailing profit lock

4. a set partial take profit by steps

5. a basket trail of the whole basket to a global close

6. basket partial takeprofit in steps to global profit lock at +50 and trailing profit lock per set after that. The trailing profit lock per set  at +50 would mean when the triangular set profit hits +50 (or basket total profit hits X% of equity) then the basket sets are unbound and can keep individually going higher profit, but in case you have a basket of some different correlating pairs in there, they can close differently but the profit is protected. (this is what i think would be most profitable, edit, and now that i think about it, why not unbound EVERY pair and let each pair have its own profit lock, why couldnt some just skyrocket, why stop them by closing the whole set or whole basket?)

Although the rings can shift forever with the sunday gap etc, and take your money, they oscillate asymetrically, such as price jumps up and down as it moves from -90 or so to +60 or so, it goes from -90 to +$60 and you have 4 or 5 sets open, or more, of the same sets (like cash4u2 methos of adding sets as profit goes negative) then if you can track and predict the profit movement and can afford the drawdown then it might be do able if you watch out for the rings diverging forever.

which leads me to one more thing, cash4u2 wanted a lot size (risk) based on money managemnet options of "I would have preferred to have automatic Lot size  (calculated by percentage of free margin) and automatic TP (calculated  by percentage of equity).                  " just throwing that out there.

May 1 2013

I am still running the EA OOTB settings on PS demo this week with default settings.

And hardly any wins at all.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I did some checking again and found the following;

These TRADES showed some wins and some losses while all the others showed losses only.

This is for this past week.

EURUSD/USDCHF/EURCHF   10 TRADES    4 WINS   6 LOSSES

1.06, 0.58, -0.07, 0.92, -0.26, -0.09, -1.38, 0.27, -1.48, -0.26   TOTAL= -0.71

EURGBP/EURCHF/GBPCHF      7 TRADES    3 WINS   4 LOSSES

1.14, -0.13, -0.46, 0.99, -0.48, -0.65, 0.48  TOTAL = 0.89

GBPUSD/USDCHF/GBPCHF   11 TRADES    5 WINS   6 LOSSES

1.48, 1.21, -0.31, -0.40, -0.35, -0.39, 0.94, -0.59, 0.25, -1.81, 0.37  TOTAL = 0.40

This week was very bad.

No wins to speak of.

Still looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm glad to find this thread with so many experienced contributors. I've been trading this method for some time and think that the best basket pairs for this strategy are EC,EU,UC ; BBS or SSB. The reason is minimum drawdown compared to other baskets because in the long term spread chart for this basket has smoothest shift. I've an indicator which tells me price spread of the basket. In my view, the best strategy could be a grid trade with this basket because the price variations are not huge and long term shifts in basket price value is minimum and smooth. If  somebody could develop a grid EA which opens both BBS and SSB grids at predefined movements in basket price and take profit levels; we can have a winner. Each opened basket should have different magic number to close separately after reaching the basket take profit level. No. of grids should not be too many, should be limited to approx 10, so that risk is minimized. Let me know what you think about it.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Can you please post your indicator?

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Here it is. I'm not a programmer but somehow managed to tweak  an indicator which I found somewhere to give price spread for three pairs.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
actually, it's more profitable if use 2 pairs, although 3-pair is more stable and less risky.

Normal EURCHF is in down trend since the 21 May ...

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi Im new here ! I mean 1st time I check this 3ad .

Very interesting ! for me could be good EURJPY , EURUSD , USDJPY coz the best spread couples

I just want to ask some question if possivle :

- which moment is it better to open the positions ?

-when is it beter the combination SSB instead of BBS ?

-in which case this sistem could have failure ?

-any special tips , advice or ahything else to pay attention for the sistem ?

Thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #745 ---
how do you use this indi?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Interesting also with 2 pairs but which couple currencies do you suggest ?

1 couple must be sort of linked right ? like USDHKD and ..... any idea ??? hehehehe

It is also possible to use both strategies , 3+2 pairs , just respect the buybuysell or sellbuybuy and includes always usdchf and eurusd and what can be matched to create the hedging ( EURUSD+USDJPY or EURGBP+GBPUSD or USDJPY+CHFJPY )

--- 帖子 #747 ---
I tried 3+2 yesterday coz I was sure after ECB pres Draghi speech something could happen !

+ I added another 3 hedge currencies ..... this is the results ! Unfortunatly IT IS JUST DEMO ACCOUNT !!!  The first trade GBPUSD on June 3rd is not included in the trial !

Totally it is over 600 USD profit in 2 days investing less than 6000 USD . NOT BAD AT ALL !!!

Hello,

I was almost give up this thread, but I can see light at the horizon.

Can you explain how does it works?

Y.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I am looking at this thread and wondering how do you go about trading, taking real money and not bothering to spend any time to educate your selves? The 3 pair hedge is designed to leave you flat in the market. It is simple math. However by using the same size for all the legs of the hedge you create an inefficiency in the model. This is what allows you to profit !!!, using correlation alone will leave you exposed to correlation curve breakdown. Correlation deviates around a base point. http://www.forexticket.us/en/tools/01-01-correlation - is a good site that shows how this happens. You can see the curve on the right and you can see how correlation deviates on each time frame. Using 3 pairs you reduce or eliminate this effect. The terms that you should look at are: Triangular Hedge, 3 pairs hedge, and circular hedge. You can look at investopaedia or wikipedia and find complete reference. Many years ago strategies have been developed to use pricing inefficiencies and basically create risk free arbitrage models. Now there is no such gravy train available for you. What is in this thread is good, but do not think that you can let this be run by a robot, you still need to learn how to trade. Yet this method will let you learn quicker and fuller, that is if you study the reasons why this works. Lastly if you think that you can just take 10K and throw it in the most complex and volatile market in the world, turn on a robot and go to sleep expecting to make money continuously or keep using demo accounts for that matter should simply go to a casino. Its better entertainment, and free drinks.

Ciao

--- 帖子 #750 ---
i think the math let you think that basically this 3hedge is only trading the pair where you are more exposed , but if you plot the result on the screen of the eurusd usdchf eurchf bbs , you can see that the profit is totally dipendent on the eur usd .

just try with the indicator posted .

if you adjust the lot size like this  : Eur usd 1lot  ,  usdchf 1.5 lot , eurchf 1.5 lot  (  bbs ) , you can see that the curve is more stable ...

that depends on their  atr ,  eur usd is roughly 100 pips per day , usdchf and eurchf is 50-60 pips per day .

--- 帖子 #751 ---
alrite, plz bear with me. i'm usually a scalper and trade shorter time frames, but couldn't hurt to learn a new strategy for longer time frames when the markets are unfavorable for such short term trading.

so i have a few questions:

1. so i guess the idea is basically to use three separate pairs and basically create a long and short position for each of the three currencies? so i can really just start off with any pair so i would choose the eurusd. now, if i buy the eurusd, then i'm essentially longing the euro and shorting the usd. now with the usd shorted, i would have to create a long position for the usd so in this case i pick another pair such as the usdjpy. and so with this, i would buy the usdjpy so now the usd is both longed and shorted with the jpy now shorted. and finally, the jpy has to be longed and so i would pick a currency pair including both the euro and jpy. in this case, it is the eurjpy. now as i originally longed the euro, the eurjpy has to be shorted to satisfy the shorted euro and longed jpy.

so can some1 just confirm if my 'logic' is correct? and yeah, i would much rather do the interpretation above rather than just memorize which pairs and combinations work.

2. could this "strategy" be optimized through a good broker?

i should probably clarify on the word "good". so basically i'm thinking that this system probably works better with a market maker that offers swap free accounts. most brokers charge swaps routinely, maybe daily or even weekly. don't get me wrong, i don't mean they charge it once a week, but rather they keep track of it in the background. what i mean is they credit it to your account at a certain time. Oanda seems to be the only broker that goes overboard and does some kind of hourly interest crediting or debiting. now, if you are going long term, swaps can really kill your account. so are we better off with a market maker that offers swap free accounts?

--- 帖子 #752 ---
totally right. The point is from the pair I know Eurchf was in down trend at that period.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
For 2 pairs, the best are eurusd and usdchf coz they have high realtion.

For 3-pair, ej-eu-echf is ok

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I agree with you. Things are changing every minutes, you must learn and know how to trade. Never dream of making money by robot.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
can any1 give me any insights on my post earlier? am i on the right track?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Check the post of the friend satfish about eurusd+usdchf hedging . click http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=279648

that's his 2 pairs hedging trade . Coz in the 2pairs there is eurusd , you can add the 3 pairs hedging trade which includes eurusd pair .

The 3 pairs hedging trade is explained in this 3ad , in the 1st post by the user cash4u . click http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...279648&page=38

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hi everybody, i'm following this thread since some days with increasing interest.

I have a dubt working in my mind about all this: is this strategy based on correlations or on relative strength?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
It's based on Currency Ring theory where the 3 currencies form a closed loop ring that will oscillate from high P/L to low P/L and back in a circular, albeit somewhat irregular (no, very.. no.... extremely irregular and unpredictable) circular-ish pattern (such as figure 8 or worse, a cloverleaf, at times).

the trick is to make sure you enter at the low P/L otherwise if you enter at the high P/L what will happen? P/L only falls. Also if you dont get in with low spreads you lose either way.

and either way you need huge account balance to bring tiny profit (or you can increase your risk....)

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Thks for your reply, it seems to me that ring theory assumes there is a constant behaviour between the pairs enjoying the ring, i.e. if the ring is formed by eur/usd, usd/chf and eur/chf - buy, buy, sell -  we well know that those pairs are usually correlated: eur/usd and usd/chf are inversely correlated and eur/usd and eur/chf are directly correlated; thus somehow we are back again into correlations concept.

As well as correlations are not stable in long term, the same will be for this system.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
its independent of correlation. if any symbol reverse in one pair, then one of the others reverses also, and it remains a solid ring equalling 1 minus the inefficiencies over time. correlation doesnt have anythign to do with it. if anything, teh correlative factor is that each currency is in one of the other pair. 3 currencies, 3 pair. its a closed loop.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Thks, now is clear. So this strategy should be spread sensitive, correct?

--- 帖子 #762 ---
You just described correlation.  If they weren't correlated (either negatively or positively) then the prices for one pair would act completely randomly compared to the other pair.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that on March 4, 2013, I opened three positions: short EURJPY, long USDJPY, long EURUSD. That is one of the hedge-triples described above in this thread. Right now, on September 3, 2013, the results are as follows: -969 pips, + 616 pips, +165 pips. The total loss is -187 pips. It's a demo account, so no big deal. I'm going to keep the positions open to see if the triple ever goes into positive territory. Right now it looks like it never will.

Just wanted to give some empirical data regarding the 3 pairs hedging strategy.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
louisaparker, in a well-behaved synthetic hedge using proper lot sizes, your floating profit/loss would never amount to much.

I suspect you opened these three trades using equal lot sizes.  One of the pairs that has a lot size bigger than it should went against you.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi Metacoder,

If i understand correctly, to create a synthetic hedge using 3 pairs we have to use the correct lot size, as you mentioned earlier.

As an example if i want to hedge GBPCHF i have to do the following :

SELL         GBPCHF    the correct lot size should be  : 1.5   (in metatrader)

BUY          USDCHF    the correct lot size should be  : 0.9

BUY          GBPUSD    the correct lot size should be  : 1.5

Am I right ? or missing something ?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
correct lot size

SELL GBPCHF  1

BUY USDCHF   1.56

BUY GBPUSD   1

--- 帖子 #767 ---
This is very interesting, I will try this out and follow closely. I always thought hedging was a possibility but never knew exactly which pairs to trade.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Correct lot sizes are found by deciding what you want to use as your "base" lot size, then considering the exchange rates to calculate the right lot size for every pair.

Since GBP, CHF and USD all appear twice, pick one of those as your base.  For example, if as Pierre is doing you say "GBP is my base and I want to buy and sell 1 lot of that", then you would sell 1.0 lot of GBPCHF and you would buy 1.0 lot of GBPUSD.  Then you must figure out how much USDCHF to buy.  You could figure out how many lots of USD you are selling with a buy of 1 GBPUSD, then use that number as your lot size for buying USDCHF.

If the exchange rate for GBPUSD is 1.56, that says you are selling 1.56 of USD when you buy 1 of GBP, so you should buy 1.56 of USDCHF.

The thing is, when you balance out your hedge this way so that losses won't be much, how do you get to profit?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Thank you Pierre and Metacoder.

I understand now, I just pick up a random example, this hedge doesn't give any profit, and the swap is negative.

Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
tinou21,

But!

You now see the foundation of one of the things I've been working on for some years now.

Once you know how to get into that very stable state of just a tiny bit of wiggle in profit/loss, you are in a position to observe how the pairs sometimes align with each other on both sides of the hedge, and how that event can be used as a trigger to reverse the direction of one of the basket's trades.

This is the essence of my Reverse6 strategy.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Thanks for sharing your strategy. Anyway I have questions to ask:1. How long do you have used this strategY?2. If the basket still minus floating,do you use averaging? thanks

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Do you still research this system? thanks

--- 帖子 #773 ---
very time consuming and got to be patient, but i pretty much use this to earn a positive swap difference.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Thanks for sharing your opinion. Anyway. May I ask you question, what will you do when the basket of 3 pairs still minus, do you close all position or make another same basket or wait till the basket go to profit? thanks

--- 帖子 #775 ---
well, the idea is that i wouldn't expect the three pairs to go in any direction by much. not sure what you mean by 'minus', do you mean negative balance? if that's what you mean, then i just leave it open as i would go under the assumption that it wouldn't go in one direction to the very extreme, but correlation from time to time will vary. as for swaps, if it's a negative swap, then i don't trade the three pairs.

i'm using icmarkets right now and:

GBPNZD - Sell

NZDUSD - Sell

GBPUSD - Buy

produces a positive swap. i only use these three pairs for the three pair hedge as if my position is negative, then i'll just still make money off of the swap rates.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Thanks for your reply. That's exactly what i mean "negative balance" of the 3 pairs. I don't use swap account. How long have you been using this strategy? from your experience how long the basket still open till profit?  Thanks for your reply

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I think im seeing the top of the iceberg, i have a long way to go.

thanks metacoder

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Im not sure but i think this kind of hedge
SELL GBPCHF 1

BUY USDCHF 1.56

BUY GBPUSD 1

will sooner or later be unbalanced.  on september 9 it was the correct lot size, but 10 days later the correct lot size should have been

SELL GBPCHF 1

BUY USDCHF 1.61

BUY GBPUSD 1

thus we have to adjust from time to time the lot size.

Am I right ?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
swap free accounts will probably give you a lot more freedom as you don't have to worry about accumulating negative swap charges. this opens you up to trading with just about any three pairs really.

in terms of breaking even or positive, it can take quite a while. one time it look a week, but generally sleeping 24 hours to three days is enough for me. also, it depends on how much you are aiming for as well. just keep in mind that it can take quite a while so best to time your entry.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
No.  Even though USDCHF would have moved from 1.56 to 1.61 in your example, GBPCHF and GBPUSD must also have moved, keeping the hedge quite well balanced.

Any profit or loss you get by opening one of these triangle hedges and leaving it alone will be driven by just a couple of things:

1)  Swap, which will usually be negative because brokers seldom provide any arrangement where profits can be found via synthetic hedges.  If trading with no swaps, this won't be a factor.

2) Big movement of the pairs such that lack of precision in the lot sizes are reflected negatively or positively.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
thank you for your answer, very helpful.

I trade all those pairs in the first post with 2 the kind BBS & SSB in the same time with different Magic Numbers .

DD is stable and the floating lose is stable too and mad 4% profit from the balance so far .

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Went over the math of this system and can conclude that the system does not work, as some others in the beginning of the thread have stated

For example (quotes are simplified to better understand the crux of the matter:

Long EUR/USD @ 1.37 1lot (+100000EUR, -137000USD exposure)

Long USD/JPY @ 102.2 now you need to cover the first dollar position of -137000USD so you need to buy 137000USD which is 1.37ot of USD/JPY, the result:

: (0USD exposure, -14001400JPY exposure and still +100000EUR exposure from the first trade)

Short EUR/JPY @ 139.89 NOW THE FUN PART, as you can see, you need to cover the exposures from the previous trades, so you need to short 100000EUR and buy 14001400JPY to have a perfect hedge with market exposure. But the going rate for this kind of EUR/JPY transaction is 139.89, which means if you go short 100000 units or 1 lot of EUR/JPY, you cancel out the EUR exposure, but are still left with 14001400-(100000*139.89)=12400JPY exposure (theoretically)

Ofcourse I didn´t factor in the carry costs and spreads, which would make it even worse.

So in conclusion, stop wasting your time people.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
do you still trading this strategy? thanks

--- 帖子 #789 ---
any one still working in this system and has success? any new ideas/concepts which can work better?

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Playing around with the idea, seems like fun

This EA is for back testing an idea.

inputs

1. ArbRing =-1 default . .0-12 twelve rings default will auto detect first suitable ring

2.Start index=? where you would like to start trade

3.End Index=? where you would like to end

4. LotSize=? whatever

5. Spread=0 will get latest spread and any other value will set that spread

6.TradeType=-1

you can set 0 for sell and 1 for buy

you can have all combinations as in

000

001

010

011===== These two are the system ones

100===== but its fun to have a look at the others

101

110

111

Bring a dead thread to life . .I was enjoying the subject

--- 帖子 #791 ---
CN YOU explain a little better this ea ?

--- 帖子 #792 ---
@tarrini65

It is a proof of concept tool which will allow you to test your ideas historically.

The system is example ring

EUR/USD=EUR/GBP x GBP/USD

for Buy Sell Sell you would set input 100

and for Sell Buy Buy 011

You can set any combination as in Buy Buy Buy =111 and Sell Sell Sell = 000 for experimentation

You must set a start index for example bar 200 to end index 50 as the trade duration

It will calculate the out come and the profit breakup .

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The chart you select must be in one of the predefined rings.

The Purpose of this is simply to test backwards to get an idea of how this works

Hello Whitearrow,

I follow this thread for years, and I believe the model, but we stiil did not find the correct way to trade with it.

I see your indi and I saw the shot you attached, but I didn't understand it (how you have conclusions from the graph)? If

you can wide it...

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi crossy,

I am new to this thread and was really intrigued by the concept. I noticed how difficult it was to back test this idea and what a big disadvantage it was while trying to come up with how to trade this thing, as many people have commented.

So I threw this tool together as a rough idea of how to back test a trade based on whatever criteria, as yet not defined, one may have selected.

The tool its self simply calculates the net movement and profit generated from the individual pairs between the start index and end index that you input and will compute the result. It will draw a line from start to finish so you can see where the trade started and ended and print the profit and info in the labels.

As to how to trade this system and if it can become that, is why I would like this thread to continue, all the major players from this thread seem to have disappeared.

The search for how to generate the right signal continues, I was hoping that people with more experience in this stratagey would suggest some entry signals.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
it should be as an indi, to collect the history data of 3 pairs, then plot the result as a histogram or a graph , nice inputs could be . lot size for  each pair , accounting swap interest ,  ecc

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Well I did do some quick rough mashup and I got these two

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The first one tracks the movement of the entire ring for all the various trade types. you can turn the color off to shut off a type. (PropMovement)

Its three trades with their reciprocals. Theoretically if you enter a trade at max negative it will end up in positive by the time it crosses zero. THEORETICALLY!!

The second one is the absolute movement of each pair in the ring (Individual Movement)

They get a little sticky because of the three pairs but they should be ok

--- 帖子 #797 ---
good job...altough i have to admit that there is really no way to have profits from the simple currency ring unless you put a twist in the recipe...

i mean , you have to risk something to gain something .

Now this risk in the ring is controlled , because of the relation between the 3 pairs. If one is up, the other is down and the third can be stuck, the day after the third moves, the firts one was up now is down and the second is stuck, and so on ...but they are all tied each other .

So if you increase risk on one side , you can hedge later on the other if you don't go to profit.

what do you think a twist can be ?

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Just thinking about this is giving me a headache, so I am sorry if the code might have a couple of bugs in it. Its just to get a handle on this thing.

One might have a look at the absolute difference or divergence from a Moving average.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In the end, there will have to be a directional bias, as the divergence could continue with out a mean reversion to the relationship values in any meaningful way.

There is some nugget of truth hidden in here

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hi all my friends, sorry I was away from the forum for a while.

So what's the point now? This indicator Arbpropmovement show exactly what we stated long time ago...IS NOT ANY DIRECTIONAL BIAS in ring (or hedge) trades! If you select the yellow and red lines (BBS,SSB) of rings you will see two elements on the long run: 1) CYCLIC MOVES and 2) NARROWEST discostment from the 0 line. Ther first factor means: soon or late you'll get profits (over the 0 line). The second factor means: you can stand the obvious drawdown as long as you want. That's all about trading these markets. Don't be foolished to dream about directional indicators...simply no way to get money. Get the money when the market give you and stand when the market is against you.

So what we should do now? I found these two old EAs from Master Hopwood, are classical BBS and SSB rings trades with a fixed take profit and different magic. The problem is that I'm not able to run the two EAs TOGHETER on the same account, we should fix this bug. So when a ring is down 0 the other provide you profits and viceversa. Another things that we need is a Money Manager autoadjustments of lots and related take profit that should follow the progressive growth of the equity mantaining a fix percent.

If some programmer can fix these points we can start to prove the strategy

An old thread, where there seem to be lots of misunderstandings...

Some years ago I created this Excel-file that explains the mathematical / technical side of Triangular Hedging.

Triangular Hedging is interesting as an idea, but problematic for practical reason. The main problem is the spread and costs like Swap and Commission, which simply will "eat up" the profit that can be made. For this reason, it's best to stick to pairs that have a low spread, and to keep the aimed profit as low as possible (to make sure that trades don't last more than absolutely necessary).

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Thanks Capella, is exactly what I mean. Every business have a margin (price-costs) depending from market prices, so the forex. We must keep ours costs as low as possible in order to keep also the margin low. But the fondamental issue is the exact amount of the FPI (fractional product inefficiency) in Pips and for each triangular cross, so, knowing the swaps and the spreads we can calculate the exact amount for a "fair" margin to apply at each ring.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
You are right.  I would add that when there are rare mathematical distortions that appear to offer profit potential, they are very fleeting.  This fact combined with what you covered makes exploitation of triangles quite problematic indeed.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Since it was some years I wrote the Excel file, I've now read it through and made some corrections to avoid confusion as well as a rewrote a part of the explanation. Attached is a new version of the Excel file.

Thanks again Kjaved, now I'll try them. Actually I run 10 rings entirely hedged using the old EA NewHedging. Since 3 days I had a max drawdown of 34%. I'll be more specific soon.

I would ask you another favour. I fixed the EA HedgingStrategy in post 20, so now open trades and open also opposite trades, but cannot run in the same time because no have a magic number, so the profit is calculated on the total not on the single hedge. This EA has a good MM and is easyly tweaked. Actually I modified it for run a 4 pairs hedged basket but, once fixed, we can use also for the triangular rings.

Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #810 ---
I have created an EA for this basket trading strategy.

Note1: The EA works on any charts, any time frames;

Note2: The EA opens positions at the open time of the next bar. For example, if you attach it to a M5 chart, it opens three positions at the beginning of the next M5 bar.

Note3: The take profit is the amount of money (in the currency of your account) that you would like to close the positions.

Note4: I do not know whether the strategy is profitable, so use the EA at your own risk.

Hi, the Ea attached sell EURCHF and  sell AUDNZD !!!!!

--- 帖子 #812 ---
No Pierre, the EA sell EURUSD, USDCHF, AUDUSD and buy NZDUSD...as for my concern...

Anyway right now we have 3 good EAs for apply the strategy: The NewHedging, the Hedge of Kjavet (post 809) and the MathTrader7 (post 811), as soon as we can add a magic at the EA HedgingStrategy (post 810) we can use that tool too.

Another usefull tools should be a FPI calculator Indicator, as the formulae of Capella showed in columns K103-K123 of the Excell file post 806. So we could also plot the variations over time. I'm sorry to bother you but I'm a really noob programmer.

Actually I run 5 pairs in balanced specular hedges for a total of 10 rings with 10 different magics (the number in ()):

EURUSD GBPUSD EURGBP BSS (1) SBB (2)

EURUSD USDJPY EURJPY BBS (3) SSB (4)

EURUSD USDCAD EURCAD BBS (5) SSB (6)

EURUSD AUDUSD EURAUD BSS (7) SBB (8)

EURUSD NZDUSD EURNZD BSS (9) SBB (10)

So they are EURUSD based, the pair magic should gain in long EURUSD while the umpair should gain in short.

I started 24/11 on a demo 10k account, settings: 1 lot, tp 25. So right now I have a gain of 885 usd and a drawdown of 29,14% (max 36,46%)

Keep observing...

if your  any 1 of 10 rings closes at TP $25, will it reopen the same ring at same time?

What was floating at the time of $885 gain?

TP $25 is only for one ring or for all the 10 rings?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Thanks again Kjaved,

so the TP 25 is for single ring, and the same ring is immediately reopened, this the way the EAs works. Actually the floating is 7698 USD and the gain is 910, with a drawdawn of 29.5

Today only one ring closed. I'm observing the behaviours of rings in relation at the direction and the moment of EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
There is also a Hedge EA, "Project EVA". Its free but you need to download the EA every month. Its base on 3 pairs, "EURUSD, USDCHF, EURCHF".

It look like base on this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=95721

I am testing it for about a month, so far it looks good but let see what it does in long run.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
just tried the ea, it closed with profit. nice work.

just wondering if the EA only does one trade a day as it has not triggered another trade since. it has been around 4 hours now since my previous trade.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
I'm glad to hear that it worked for you. If the EA didn't open another trade right after the basket closed, then it is a bug. I will fix the bug in the next version.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Kjaved, I saw that the Hedging Strategy works fine with the magic, but once a magic reach the profit they close ALL the trades, also that of the hedged EA with different magic...should be a bug...

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Here is a new version of the EA which fixes the bug you mentioned, and opens a basket only if the spread of all three pairs become less than the specified values in the input settings of the EA.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
I checked but did not find any bug. check if any other EA making problem.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Good job Math

I think also the correct size in setting must be for, GBPUSD 1 lot, GBPCHF 1 lot,  USDCHF  1.56 for a perfect hedge

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Cheers MathTrader7.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
For the perfect hedge, as you mentioned, the lot sizes must be adjusted (GBPUSD 1 lot, GBPCHF 1 lot, USDCHF 1.56). But the question is which combination of the lot sizes would be profitable, perfect or imperfect hedge?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Math with the perfect hedge the spread  with retail broker eat eventual profit. you need trade with institutional broker with no spread (API FIX)

With imperfect hedge with rate GBPUSD 1.56 ( Buy GBPUSD Buy USDCHF Sell GBPCHF) at the end you are selling 0.56 lot  USDCHF

I think the best is running SSB and BBS in the same time with the same ECN broker with low commissions ( perfect or imperfect hedge are the same as with imperfect hedge trading BBS and SSB in the same time you balance sell 0.56 with buy 0.56)

I think also the best is to choose pairs with lowest spread as EUR USD GBP

I will put your EA SSB and BBS on 2 charts. I will let you know the results

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hi Math,

Silly question:

The adjustments you referred need changes through time or are permanent values?

(Sorry for my english, is not my native language)

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Hi Arkhro, If you want to trade a perfect hedge, then you need to adjust the lot sizes in the input settings of the EA and start it.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Maybe I didn't make myself clear...

In this case  (GBPUSD 1 lot, GBPCHF 1 lot, USDCHF 1.56), do you input these settings permanently or do have to make adjustments every day?

--- 帖子 #828 ---
You apply these settings (GBPUSD 1 lot, GBPCHF 1 lot, USDCHF 1.56) permanently for perfect hedge.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Thank you Math!

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Ok Kjaved, I'll check again...

Actually we DON'T need a "perfect hedge"...a true perfect hedge non give losses...so no give gains...(that's why we talk about "inefficiency"); the problem, as I stated before, is just "realize" the gains and "stand" the losses. The hedge trading give us only the possibility to stand the losses as long as we must. This is very hard to do with single trades...if you no have almost unlimited accounts.

But how the drawdawn works? I attach an old indicator of Swingman that can be used only for EURUSD, USDCHF and EURCHF ring and I'm not able to open in order to chek if the calculation of FPI (actually the Spearman's divergence) is calculate following the Capella formulae or not. But anyway the value ranging between +1 and -1, so if we check the behaviours of the rings using the MathTrader7 v.2 EA we can verify the plus or minus referring the divergence values (see picture 1). If we can use a spread-free account our "margin" can be highest. Otherwise we should gain as the divergence exceed the 2.5/3% level. But also our drawdown should have a RANGE, as our gains. My 10 rings (sse post) played since 24/11 actually get a 36% drawdown, following the umbalance between the pair and umpair EAs (see pic 2) as the EURUSD go from the initial value of 12382 (opening 24/11) till the 12531 max of 26/11. As the EURUSD reverse to 12425 the umpair EAs start to gain and rebalance the DD (?). So keep observing.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Similhouse , Spieler system is based on price (divergence) of  EURCHF and if levels 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 are triggered negatively you BUY EURUSD and USDCHF or if triggered positively you SELL EURUSD and USDCHF; these 2 pairs  are negatively correlated . http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=95721

Our system is arbitrage system but dont survive  with brokers spread

If you wish trade correlations the better is Dreamliner system. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=160912 .The  system work replacing stochastic with MA

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Yes Pierre, I know the Spieler strategy (and also the Spieler's system EAs that no works and must be revisited), my suggestion, in order to limit the DD (this is our goal) is open a BBS ring as the Spieler divergence reach a value of -0,25 and continuing open the same basket untill the -1 value. Viceversa we can open SSB rings starting from the +0,25 value. This can be done with a good EA and applied to a broker with very low spreads. In this case the DD should be limited. Of course each ring must be closed at the smallest profit possible (I think around 30 for a 1 lot setting). In the picture below you can see as the basket BBS that I opened yesterday close at 30 dollar profit as soon the value of Spieler's divergence reached the 0,50% (we opened the hedged rings at a zero level). In order to do this with the rings different than EURUSD USDCHF EURCHF we should modify the settings of the Spieler's Hedge Divergence Indi above. This is the way to mix divergence and arbitrage....also because they are the two faces of the same medal...

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Still you are using the hedge rings? what are the results so far? Gain, Loss, floating etc?

In long run what the system will do?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Hi Kjaved,

the hedges are still running, the drawdawn is stabilized at 61% but also the gains, the rings close much slowly and the gaps between pairs and umpairs rings is still on place. The strategy of random entries NO WORK IN THE LONG RUN. We must find an indicator in order to open ONLY ONE RING AT TIME in order to avoid the DD. I modified the Excell of Capella adding a FIP calculator, following the formulae, but tha values are not usefull to be used as indications for trade. As well the Spieler divergence indicator of Swingman that reset every day......maybe we can try with the Propmovement Indy, it seems follow very well the cycles of rings, so we can enter a directional ring EU EG GU SBB (yellow line) when reach the value of -500 and close as soon reach the 0 level and do the same with the EU EG GU BSS (red line). The problem is that I'm unable to change the rings settings of the indicator, so I can test only the EURUSD/EURGBP/GBPUSD ring...I'll do this week....

Keep working.....

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Anybody tried to used it on binary option?

I wonder what will be the result.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
The problem is that Binary Options brokers usually offer sparse currency pairs such that you cannot find all the three pairs to close a ring.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
You are right about it, my broker doesn't support GBPCHF, USDCHF.

But can put trade on , USDJPY, EURJPY, EURUSD.

Here is my last day result on USDJPY, EURJPY & EURUSD on binary option.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here i won on 2 bet that's why i was profitable, but if won only on EURUSD & lost on rest of the two. Then i will get a total loss.

Perhaps, a smart combination could help in here. Anybody any idea?

Regards.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I just want try to answer to the first and foremost question about hedge tradings...why is better trade hedges instead of trading simple pairs? So I made some historical calculation on a selected numbers of hedge rings:

AUDJPY/NZDJPY/AUDNZD

AUDJPY/CADJPY/AUDCAD

NZDJPY/CADJPY/NZDCAD

EURJPY/GBPJPY/EURGBP

EURJPY/CHFJPY/EURCHF

I tested double hedges (a.e. Buy AUDJPY and sell NZDJPY that is equivalent to Buy AUDNZD) and triangular hedges (a.e. Buy AUDJPY, Buy NZDJPY and Sell AUDNZD that is equivalent to Sell half lot of AUDNZD). I was surprised to see that we no have any real benefit to trade hedges for the EUR crosses, instead we have great benefits in trading hedges for the AUD, NZD and CAD crosses...the benefits are nothing magic, we just reduce the DD (and in the same time the gains) for a value ranging between the 15% (Double Hedge AUDJPY CADJPY) and a maximum reduction of 84% obtained by trading the triangular hedge AUDJPY/CADJPY/AUDCAD. So that's only mean that we can stand a negative trade MUCH LONGER than trading the single pair...that's all. Trading hedges simply reduce DD and gains.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Just wondering new currency for hedging.

AUDCHF -BUY or SELL

EURAUD -BUY or SELL

EURCHF - SELL or BUY.

Have any one tried this combination??

3 pairs traded. EUR/USD; GBP/USD; EUR/GBP;

EURUSD - Long

GBPUSD - Short

EURGBP - Short

for 0.1 Lot, TP is always 22.0$ and SL 20.0$.

When one of the pairs will hit SL or TP, we need it to be reopened in 5 seconds (same direction).

You can test it on your own if you want guys, it's not something amazing but it has to work in a long run.

Any help and replay will be appreciated. (besides, I use FXCC ECN account, with almost zero spread (0.6 for EU and without commision))

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Hi Nik13,

so in this way you short 0.5 lot EURGBP, if you stay with the trend you can get money, otherwise you lose...

My suggestion is wait for an historical minimum of pairs like AUDNZD or EURGBP (maybe also EURCHF but now the connection is lost) than enter in countertrend with a 3 pairs hedge without SL nor TP...just let's run...take profit somewhere in the middle (look at the monthly charts).

In your case the trade EU GU EG BSS is right if we stay near a maximum of EURGBP, if we stay near a minimum you should trade a SBB hedge.

All the best

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Is this system still working? I have read good & bad comments, want to know before testing this.

Hi Brucech,

I found a really beautiful tool on this forum: the script and EA of abokwaik (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=529896)

With this tool you can manage any kind of hedging basket as a normal pair, so you can see how any kind of hedge is a directional trade anyway then you can lose or gain as any other trade. Is amazing observe how for example the "nearly perfect" hedge of 1 lot EURUSD, 1 Lot GBPUSD and 2 lots USDCHF (BBB or SSS) have anyway a "direction" and can be traded with any indicator you like. We can just guess that the range of moves of "hedges" is a little bit narrower than the corresponding single pairs, and this tool is very usefull for observe those behaviours. If we are able to "narrow" the ranges, so we can control the DD more effectively and may play around some kind of martingale (or some kind of averaging) in order to get profits also from trades going in the wrong direction.

To be more explicit I attach the H1 charts both of EURUSD and the 3 Hedge pairs EURUSD/GBPUSD/USDCHF BBB with a slight difference in lots: EURUSD 1,5 - GBPUSD 1 - USDCHF 2,5 in order to obtain a more suitable hedge. The chart is created using the script of abokwaik attached above.

As you can observe the huge move down of EURUSD is fairly balanced using the 3 pairs hedge, so the hedge seems to be more tradable.

I have downloaded and installed both script and EA but I don't see the offlline charts updating the candles.

I have re installed and write the charts and keep the chart opened that I ran script on, but still no updating.

Hello MathTrader7 ,

have long been interested in this strategy . I also appreciate your EA that if improved with some features could become very powerful in relation to this strategy . For example, using an indicator called NeutralHedge Overlay_v4 written by Swingman that allows, with an arbitration, to decide whether to enter the market with BBS or SSB, in relation to the price difference that you would find . For example if EURGBP he was at a higher price than EURUSD and GBPUSD , with trading range OK , you decide to enter with SSB . In contrast with BBS.

Thank you

Emidio

Hello dear traders!

I'm trying to formalize ideas of the first post and I have 3 double-questions to practics of this strategy

1. Do I close all 3 trades when I get summary profit? And then? - REopen all 3 trades?

2. Do I set SL on every pair and which size?

3. What do I have to do when the SL is reached? Reopen or close all 3 trades?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #861 ---
This is the results of last 2 days. Gaining of 20 pips.

I figure success in this systems lies with 2 things,

You need to know the trend, that will help you out.

You need to smartly close your trade, close the profitable & leave the unprofitable one in balanced condition so that you don't get much loss.

Here I opened two SSB & BBS orders. Then i close GBPUSD & USDCHF buy trade first was in profit. Later closed USDCHF buy & sell. Now what ever we had equals USDCHF sell, it was falling, so closed it in profit. Now whole set is in profit.

hi how i can setup the timeframe about this indicator? i saw the number 1440 on the tf setup, but its correct? is not better to add 0 for all timeframes??

this is what i mean about tf=0

correlation not valid??

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Chris B is correct. Your hedges are uneven, your not holding a dollar neutral hedge with this strategy and are over exposed. Anybody trading these strategies will inevitably run into trouble without adjusting efficient lot size for each position

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I have been testing this method for past 12 hours on 10 demo accounts simultaneously with EA. Instead of 10 pips TP I used 3 pips TP on 3 pairs hedge. So far I've hit TP multiple times on almost all pairs. I also made my own 12 pair hedge with 10 pips TP, it has been hit 3 times in 12 hours. It maybe too early to tell if this can work long time, I will keep testing it for a few weeks. If the results are promising, I will go live.

Does it work?

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Do you have or know of the math equation that will calculate the exact optimal lot size for multiple pairs? I have a balanced 10-pair star-hedge (10 trades on, using USD,GBP,EUR,CHF,JPY), but I'm not sure how to calculate proper lot size with 10 trades but only 4 of them using my base currency (USD). Not to mention the fact that they continually change, is there a way/script to automate this "proper sizing" info for me?

--- 帖子 #869 ---
I don't really have a handy EA or Indicator that does it for me, but I found a calculator on Babypips.com that helped me estimate it as much as possible for the mirco amounts I'm testing with.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
It really depends on the strategy in my opinion. Value at Risk is what I would use for a large basket of 10 trades. Search for articles on 'beta hedge ratios'. There are a range of models that will help you calculate.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Great idea!

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Here's an idea I'd love your input on:

For a hedge strategy that waits to profit from the imbalance, do you think it would be better to have multiple triangle groups that can be removed as they hit profitability, or would it be better to have all of them interlaced, requiring the whole group to be closed at the same time (if you want to maintain hedged position)?

Here's the two examples I'm testing. I've been able to close them both positively after a couple days, although the multiple triangle strategy still has 3 running (slightly negative) groups.

What I'm most curious about is the possibility of reaching positive status in the hedge, then closing a portion of the hedge to continue to run the profitability. Is there a solid way to do this? Does the inefficiency of the hedge reveal a strategy that can be tapped, or maybe reveal a good opening for an inverse of the hedge to play off it's 'cycles' of positive/negative profitability? If not, at any rate I'm hoping to create something that can safely create a small profit over time without the risk.

Let me know your thoughts and insight.

Examples:

Strategy 1:

Trade 5 triangle groups using USD, GBP, EUR, CHF, JPY (U,G,E,C,J). Parallel trades in separate groups are always the same direction so that we don't simply cancel out. Close any triangle that makes reasonable profit. (Adjust lot size accordingly as well)

- (minus) = SELL, + (plus) = BUY

lot sizing for this test was all (.02) except EG (.01). This is a pretty crude balancing, but I want to be able to live test with micro lots so I'm demo-testing it this way.

Group 1: -GU, -UC, +GC

Group 2: -UC, -CJ, +UJ

Group 3: +UJ, -EJ, +EU

Group 4: +GC, -EC, +EG

Group 5: +EG, +GJ, -EJ

Strategy 2:

Trade 5 currencies in a star configuration that allows for 10 non-cancelling trades. Close entire strategy on profitability.

+UG +JU +CE +JE -EU -EG -UC -GJ -GC -CJ

Some members have messaged me about my post and asked if this works long term, so I thought I should comment on it here. No it doesn't work long term. I tested all the pairs mentioned on this post simultaneously. All the pairs went too far into loss in the end. I waited a week for profit to turn positive, but it didn't even come close, so I stopping the test. Sorry for getting your hopes high

ChuckNZ where are you?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
I tried the star pattern for about 2 weeks in MT4, but it drifted quite far into negative territory. I'm pretty sure the grouping is correct, and the lot sizing isn't terribly inaccurate, so I'm wondering if long-term, our currencies do drift out of sync and stay that way long enough for us not to wait for them to come back. For example, the value of CHF dropped sharply during my test, but the gainers didn't seem to gain as much as the losers lost. Perhaps this is because in general, the market sentiment was suddenly negative CHF (or it's value was manipulated by the big boys) but not necessarily positive in the other currencies.  Could this create a new baseline that wouldn't ever show any recovery back to the balance? It looked like it, but it still confounds me how this could occur with the market being a situation where the very buying/selling is what creates the changes in value.

Anyway, I'd love for someone much smarter than myself to chime in on this. I'm only guessing, but I'm sure someone with an economics or experienced trading background would be able to shed some light on how it really works.

After trying basket hedging with a 5-pair star pattern (10 trades), I've decided that it's not worth pursuing any longer.

Yes, there seems to be imbalances, but they're smaller than spreads, slippage, and most importantly, general drift of the market. I (demo) bought a 10-way hedge with 5 majors, and watched it hover around zero, occasionally drifting positive above my spreads. Then suddenly one pair will spike, the rest of the hedge will react, but not completely--sending my value either up or down. Additionally, recovery was never complete. The market tries to recover back to that same parity point, but it never really does. It simply retraces an amount and finds a new generally neutral point, which either puts me in positive or negative territory, depending on which direction I was in that pair.  To restate--I found that a 10-way hedge of the 5 majors to NOT be risk-free because of this random (every week or two) re-balancing of the overall market. It's like how we feel about "normal" gas prices. Is $2.00/gallon a good price or a bad one? Is it "normal"?  The market hedge does stay balanced--until it's disrupted, and it finds a new normal.

So, in summary, my hedging analogy is that hedging strategies are like following tomato trucks, watching for them to hit bumps and drop a few tomatoes to gather...a minuscule gleaning process that is probably inferior to simply learning how to determine which direction the tomato truck is traveling, and mitigating risk that he takes and unexpected turn.

Save yourself the time, there is no long term edge here. Read the whole thread. Many had early short term success then vanished after a few weeks. Do you notice there has been no long term posters claiming how wonderful this system is. No one last even 2 months claiming success. These equal pair hedging schemes have been on FF for years. Read some of the early pages and the posters that explain why this strategy does not work long term. They know what they are talking about. Either way good luck. Maybe in 6 months you can come back and make me eat crow. Just hate to see this thread pop up over and over again and new people waste their time on it.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Hi all! Good thread. I also find information about this way of trading few days. Some information was about arbitrage between different brokers, but imho it is wrongway. Only this way is can live I think. Hedge 3 pairs. It means I buy EURUSD and I sell synthetic of EURUSD. Sell synthetic is similar maybe buy EURJPY and sell USDJPY. In result - buy EURJPY + sell USDJPY + buy EURUSD. I cant make a code cause I not programmist, and also my english is not good=), but I try make a robot EA in one of EA-constructor. Here I share with you first version of EA and hope you can test it with good history data with real spread.

UPD. I still think about best point of enter. Maybe between two sessions - asian and europeen. Cause when asian is over and before London start we have some quite hourse that can be point to enter. Then London opens volatility, then USA also goes and EA try to catch peaks and wait user made fix-profit level of triangle. One triangle - one EA. Every triangle also can have group - and every EA can seek and close only trades from his group. I think is good option.

Found this indicator via this thread. Maybe it's not used here, but if you're handy with MetaEditor, it can probably be modified to show pairs of interest.

I fixed the indicator (I'm no coder) it was badly screwed up showing the wrong line-chart for some of the currency pairs.

It's now correct, but only is coded to display USDXXX, so far. I might get around to it later or not.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
If you don't like the spacing between the labels and line chart(s) go into MetaEditor and remove some of the spaces.

Search for something like this:

ObjectSetText("EURUSD", " .............EURUSD " + DoubleToStr(EURUSD[0], 4), 8, "arial");

And remove some spaces " .............EURUSD ". Note: I had to put dots or periods in place of spaces here because FF removes the spaces during forum formatting.

Apparently the spacing appears differently on various screen displays, mine is 1920x1080, so I deleted a few spaces and replaced the above file. Labels are closer to lines than shown in picture.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
i don't understand this strategy, If you are hedging these pairs. They move the same in pips amount. When you are earning 100$ from one pair. then on other side you are losing 70$ from second pair and losing 30$ from third pair. this way you are on same level again.

I had made this EA just 2 years ago then i have been trying it for many pairs and with many brokers. But i had no success because the float amount remain same always but sometimes it even increase due to floating spread and swap.

Please let me know that with what broker are you using this EA? I hope we can make the same results.

Thanks.

if you can hedge 3 pairs and remain sum zero, why not let the daily swap rate work in your favor? i.e. have nzd/jpy long, and its 4x the pip, make that daily and you would make bank for not doing anything, but from what i understand, the triangle never really stays in sync and become lopsided no?

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Yes you are right on your side to keep open the positions and earn swap. But maybe you don't know that most of the brokers has term/condition for this matter and they says that they reserve the right to correct the swap. So mean that they won't let you earn swap this way.

Why both Currency going on negative

--- 帖子 #921 ---
I'm assuming your position sizes of 0.1 are 1000 units of base currency.

Based on your positions and prices, this is what you've done:

1 EUR = 1.48750 CAD

You bought 1000 EUR sold 1487 CAD

1 EUR = 1.1119 USD

You sold 1000 EUR bought 1119 USD

1 USD = 1.3290 CAD

You sold 1000 USD bought 1329 CAD

EUR Total = 1000 - 1000 =  Flat EUR

CAD Total = -1487 + 1329 = Short 158 CAD

USD Total = 1119 - 1000 = Long 119 USD

So you're really trading the USDCAD long. Look at the chart of the USDCAD.  Its down approximately 250 pips over the past 3 days.

This is why you're going negative.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
thanks is there any excel formula or software which can analyze the pair

--- 帖子 #923 ---
You'll need to look for an exposure calculator.  I know that Oanda have an exposure tab on their java trading platform.

I'm sure there are basket indicators here that will plot your basket (triangle hedge) equity.

Just remember that to make any profit in the market, you have to have exposure to it.

You can refine your triangle hedge to the point that the amounts that you are exposed to are so small that you won't make any profit.

What you did was pay $1.30 in commission where it would have been $0.04 cents for a 0.01 Long USDCAD trade.  The results would be the same.

I hope you can see what's happening here.  You won't make any money by having a perfect hedge.  You'll only make money by having exposure to the market,

and there are cheaper ways of doing it than opening up 3 trades.

It's a learning curve, and at least it hasn't cost you a lot.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Hi Coder,

Currently i am not trading for profit i need to find the right entry for profit. If the direction is not the issue and triangle hedge will make profit always when it run for long period with 1 LOT i am OK to do.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
I'm just trying to help. Please read what I've written again. Look at the math.  Understand what's happening.

Forget thinking about your trade as a hedged triangle and start thinking about it as your exposure to the market.  You're exposed long USDCAD at the moment.

Your hedge will not always make profit.   It will only make profit if the market that your exposed to moves higher or lower than your entry point, depending if you're exposed long or short.  This may take seconds, minutes, hours, days, months or even years.  It's no different to normal trading.

Direction and the timing of entry are still the issue.  There is no magic in hedging.  You're just reducing your exposure and hoping that in the long term that the market will move in your direction.  It probably will eventually, but in the mean time the swap will kill your account.

Try some other examples.  Learn how to calculate your exposure and then watch the price chart that you're exposed to move up and down.  Enjoy your journey.  You have enough information above to hopefully push you in another direction.  Coder

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi Coder

How you say i am going long (USD-CAD) why not (CAD-USD).  So best price to enter for this triangle pair if the value for  CAD Total  and USD Total should be less spread range right  currently it was having - 39

EUR Total = 1000 - 1000 = Flat EUR

CAD Total = -1487 + 1329 = Short 158 CAD

USD Total = 1119 - 1000 = Long 119 USD

It's the same thing.  You can express it either way.

The important bit is your exposure:

Short 158 CAD, Long 119 USD

You can express it as either short CADUSD or long USDCAD.  It doesn't matter.

Whatever position you take long or short affects the first pair.  And is the opposite for the second pair.

Lets take CADUSD.  You're selling CAD and buying USD.

Now express it as USDCAD.  Your buying USD and selling CAD.

It's the same, just swapped around.  Your exposure doesn't change though.

There is no best price to enter.  When you enter your exposure is fixed.  The market moves either up or down.  You equity either grows or shrinks.

Same as normal trading.  There is no edge here.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
So you mean to say if no edge means how we make profit for holding the position for long period. I mean in any market condition we are safe to take the profit right with less risk involved. But we need more equity to hold the position

--- 帖子 #930 ---
I think where most of the triangle hedge trading is falling down is in entering all three trades at the same time, often paying no attention to lots -- just using equal lot sizes for each pair -- and hoping profit will happen by luck.

At any point in time, the three pairs' exchange rates are mathematically balanced. They have to be, otherwise bots would be exploiting the imbalances all day long, and many people have tried this. What I think we want to do is identify entry points that are, for example, 5 pips to the advantage of the snapshotted exchange rates, for each currency pair. To reach any of those advantaged entry points, we have to wait, of course.

In a sideways market, all three entry points will likely be reached and profit can be taken. If the market breaks away in directions that are against your hedge directions just after one or two of the trades have opened without turning back, would be when you would see your black swan.

So think about all of that and figure out when you'd decide to close your hedge and when you'd decide to let it run. Write down all of the scenarios that can occur and make a plan. I think good strategies can be built around triangle hedging.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Profit is made by luck when the lot sizes are equal. Equal lot sizes means it's a low quality hedge that can go positive or negative as the market moves. When the market moves in favor of one of the pairs that is sized proportionally larger than it should be, is when the basket of trades can stumble into profit

ok my last  post about this.. good bye! enjoy your forex strategies!

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Consider not entering all three trades at the same time.  Establish a mathematically balanced snaphot, available on any given tick since the brokers need to show undistorted, mathematically balanced quotes to keep arbitrageurs and distortion seekers in check.

Then, set entry points above the snapshotted prices for sells and below them for buys.  Wait for the market to come to those targets and enter.  The odds you'll get into a profitably hedged basket of trades are pretty good.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Which is more power USD or JPY

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Another element that makes sense to me is to pick pairs that, together, make up several interconnected triangles. Trade each pair in one direction in one account, and in the opposite directions in another account. EAs would be just about a must for this.

Here's a suggested basket of pairs, representing many triangles:

Account 1
EURUSD - Sell
USDJPY - Sell
EURJPY - Sell
GBPJPY - Buy
EURGBP - Buy
EURCHF - Buy
GBPCHF - Buy
GBPUSD - Sell
USDCHF - Buy
CHFJPY - Buy

Account 2
EURUSD - Buy
USDJPY - Buy
EURJPY - Buy
GBPJPY - Sell
EURGBP - Sell
EURCHF - Sell
GBPCHF - Sell
GBPUSD - Buy
USDCHF - Sell
CHFJPY - Sell

--- 帖子 #942 ---
It's much simpler of course to do this with one single triangle.  Remember, you only enter the buys when below the anchor bids and the sells when above the anchor asks.  This arrangement provides a means of becoming profitably hedged within each account and across the two accounts.  The likelihood of becoming profitably hedged is high.

Account 1
USDJPY - Sell
USDCHF - Buy
CHFJPY - Buy

Account 2

USDJPY - Buy
USDCHF - Sell
CHFJPY - Sell

--- 帖子 #947 ---
The anchor is a snapshot of the bids/asks at any point in time of all the currency pairs.

There are indeed three unique larger triangles.  Just don't count CHFJPY|GBPJY|GBPCHF twice even though the illustration contains it twice.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
As one absorbs the number of triangles in this arrangement, an important thing to realize is the number of ways it is possible to become profitably hedged for any single trade that can be opened.  I found it worthwhile to analyze exactly what those ways are.  The illustrations I've come up with helped me with the analysis.

OK, now that we have the illustrations in place, what does it mean?

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Let's take one pair and unpack what needs to happen if a trade gets opened on the pair.

Let's say a buy trade for EURUSD gets opened because its ask fell below its anchor bid.  There are four ways for a EURUSD buy to get profitably hedged as long as we are using two accounts to trade every pair in both directions.

1.  A EURUSD sell gets opened on the other account, at a higher price than the EURUSD buy.

2.  A EURGBP sell gets opened above its anchor ask and a GBPUSD sell gets opened above its anchor ask.

3.  A EURJPY sell gets opened above its anchor ask and a USDJPY buy gets opened below its anchor bid.

4.  A EURCHF sell gets opened above its anchor ask and a USDCHF buy gets opened below its anchor bid.

What are the odds that one of these 4 scenarios occurs after the EURUSD buy?

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Below is a list of the triangles of which each currency pair is a member.

Every currency pair is a member of 3 different hedge triangles. There are 5 individual currencies, 10 currency pairs and 10 unique hedge triangles. Each triangle appears below 3 times with the pairs ordered differently.

EURUSD - EURUSD|EURGBP|GBPUSD, EURUSD|EURJPY|USDJPY, EURUSD|EURCHF|USDCHF
USDJPY - USDJPY|USDCHF|CHFJPY, USDJPY|GBPUSD|GBPJPY, USDJPY|EURUSD|EURJPY
EURJPY - EURJPY|EURGBP|GBPJPY, EURJPY|EURCHF|CHFJPY, EURJPY|EURUSD|USDJPY

USDCHF - USDCHF|USDJPY|CHFJPY, USDCHF|GBPUSD|GBPCHF, USDCHF|EURCHF|EURUSD
CHFJPY - CHFJPY|EURCHF|EURJPY, CHFJPY|USDJPY|USDCHF, CHFJPY|GBPJPY|GBPCHF

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Remember, we would not open all pairs at once.  We open buys when the ask falls below the snapshotted anchor bid for that pair.  We open sells when the bid rises above the snapshotted anchor ask for that pair.  This is not arbitrage.  It's simply letting profitable hedges come to us.

I do sometimes basket shopping. where im long or short on particular currency and opposite on others.

but what i see here is usdcad trade made in expensive way.

i think u miss some details about proportions. what i mean here is : every pairs lot is different. lets take simplest case where eurusd is zero lots usdcad position is like 1 lot and eurcad position is like -2 lot.

so 2 lots eur short , 1 lot usd long and 1.48*2 -1.329 or sth .. cad long

that portfolio behave differently that its main components that is eurcad and usdcad

moreover u can land with so called mean reverting portfolios.

anyway. u re missing a point. number of lots per instrument should differ in order to whole this thing have any sense

different composition - lot size or timing is a key, here u have example behaviour of different lot sizes

be aware my friend that most of the traders here are not experts like you and they are just training on the systems and most of them after few trials will blow up thier accounts.

please add to on top of that, the brokers who do  not like hedging and they will try to force the clients to stop hedging.

i use hedging in five pairs with compounding

it is a very complicated method

add on top of that the daily range

omg, if the trader is not a mth expert, he will lsoe his mind doing the hedging in 2 pairs so what about 5 pairs at the same time plus each pair there is internal hedging between sell and buy orders...!!

Thank you

--- 帖子 #964 ---
I have a system of 5 pairs hedging as well. ..very profitable as well.. so similar as the triangular.. but USIng 5 currencies..

I developed a system that generates a lot monthly, enought to be weahly in this bussiness..AND the most important.. never burning your ACCOUNT

something like this..

BUY GBPUSD BUY NZDCAD BUY AUDNZD SELL GBPCAD SELL AUDUSD <---GBP USD NZD CAD AUD

--- 帖子 #965 ---
by the way.. this is the best 3 hedge setup of the day

Hi Samer, I'm no expert but I have tried many forex trading strategies in the last 15 years. I've learnt a few things about what does not work. And I'm reasonably handy as far as writing EAs. Haven't gotten into writing indicators, I've left that to others.

The approach I've outlined here is a new idea to me though I'm sure many others have thought of it and have tried it. I haven't been able to even trade it on demo accounts. The only way I would ever attempt to trade it is in an automated fashion; in other words, with Expert Advisor software.

This approach is definitely not arbitrage but it seeks to mimic it in a way. Arbitrage depends on disagreements in pricing at the same point in time, while my proposed approach seeks the disagreements as time passes.

Not everyone appreciates or understands that in the 10 pairs I list, there are 4 unique and independent ways for every individual trade to get profitably hedged, but I've tried to illustrate it. Do with it what you will, or not.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
I hadn't heard before that brokers don't like hedging. I do get the impression that many of them just don't want us being profitable, period. One thing I know they really hate is arbitrage, especially one-leg latency arbitrage.

The approach I've been discussing is within the rules, even for USA traders. Any same-pair hedging would be done across two accounts, either with the same broker or with two different brokers. If using EAs, this means you have to know how to coordinate the trades between two accounts.  Especially important would be keeping the snapshot anchors the same across the two accounts, and using the same lot sizes, which in turn means account type and leverage should be the same.

Trades would tend to be opened at different times, though sometimes within seconds or a few minutes of each other. They could be held open long enough to not give the broker heartburn due to very short duration trading.

If the brokers hate hedging, then they must hate pretty much all traders. How many traders today have EURUSD|USDCHF|EURCHF open on the same account? A great many, I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #969 ---
this is maybe a very wrong point from you, not many have so many EURUSD|USDCHF|EURCHF open all the time. and when people have it open, its because of strategies not work together.

you are still trying to do arbitrage trading, whats funny because you are many many years to late. but try it, looks you are at the beginning, you will learn in some lost months what reality is against calculations. you need to split broker cheating trades from real trades. you concentrate more in cheating then trading by using slow datafeed from some broker to open/close trades by know prices already from other brokers feed.

you can really try it, but when broker will stop your wins, dont talk anything against broker, it was problem is this case. hedging over many brokers is nothing more then differnet arbitrage trading trying. you really think you have found sometzhing brokers and many people dont know since many years, its just market basics.

maybe its more easy from you, you find some traders who can help you with this, so you dont invest to much time in things many brokers dont allow (and this is ok that they dont allow, or many brokers could not survive).

maybe its best you start testing it in bigger real accounts, so you see it more easy what all people will tell you. in demo accounts or mini small real accounts nobody cares about you by the broker, so you will no learn if it will be possible and you will lose time.

--- 帖子 #970 ---
dukas_trader, you obviously aren't paying attention and exhibit zero understanding of what I've been discussing.  There is no arbitrage involved, no utilization of slow vs fast brokers, no comparing one broker's data against another's, nothing like that.  When you can form coherent thoughts and write them down, maybe I'll have further discussion with you.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
ah ok, you speak about the most simple hedge to program. its 30 min programming neccessary, then test it in bigger real account , then you see what will happen with trading hedge basket in same account.

i thought you speak about something little big complicated, so its very very easy and done extrem often. even experts allready there online from this. results its better you see by your own.

i did read in your text 2 accounts with 2 brokers or same, so i thought its 2 level hedge arbitrage, but you try only 1 level hedge arbitrage, so its even more know the result.

i tried only to save you much time, but maybe you need to see by your own. and maybe you dont know by your own in the moment what you want or speak about (sounds to crazy sometimes - sometimes is hedging with 2 accounts , sometimes arbitrage, then is not,.... its better to let wait until you have at least basic knowledge in trading part or progamming, but its good project to learn both)

Hi Meta,

You have a very good understanding of relationships between pairs.. I loved the clarity in you explanations and schematics.

I am not a coder, just a modder when I can understand the logic of the indicator and task at hand.

I put together a very amateurish indicator for 5 pair hedging that lechuzon mentioned.
It calculates the dollar total of the 5 pair hedge for the current day (since day open).

Here are the indicators. Both needed in order for the Circular5 to work.

Good Luck all.....

--- 帖子 #973 ---
There probably are many ways to use the indicator. One possible way to enter the trade when the indicator value <=-50 (enter short), exit at 0, with a loss. or exit at -150 for $100 profit. (for 1 lot each pair).

Opposite for the longs...

Indicator calculates BUY GBPUSD BUY NZDCAD BUY AUDNZD SELL GBPCAD SELL AUDUSD.

If the indicator value is >0 this basket is making money the way it is traded.

If the indicator value is <0 than the basket is making money in the opposite trade direction of each pair.

Good Luck...

Very interesting, GoldTheHun.

Inspiration was yours and lechizon's...

I should be clear about this. We wouldn't use two accounts to compare datafeeds. We would use two accounts only to be able to trade all pairs in both directions.  For non-USA traders who can trade one pair in both directions on one account, one account could be used.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
No. No two accounts and no 2 brokers needed. 1 broker only...

It's logic is a plain basket logic.

If you trade the following way BUY GBPUSD BUY NZDCAD BUY AUDNZD SELL GBPCAD SELL AUDUSD and it makes profit when the indicator gives positive values.

If you trade the opposite (Sell GBPUSD Sell NZDCAD Sell AUDNZD Buy GBPCAD Buy AUDUSD, the minus figures in the indicator means you are in profit.

I hope I am clear enough. If not please let me know.

Thanks...

MetaCoder,

Trying to wrap my brain around this approach. I hope that you shed some more light on this approach by answering some questions that I have.

1. SnapShot of Bids & Asks. Is it necessary to keep the same Bids & Asks? Or can we widen the GAP between the Bids & Asks ... as long as we widen the GAP the same on all pairs?

2. GBPCHF & CHFJPY.  To trade this approach do we need to have 2 instances of GPBCHF & CHFJPY? Because it is shown in the diagram you illustrated.

3. What do you estimate is the potential TakeProfit one cycle of this approach? Do you look for 5 pips or ????

4. Has anyone attempted an EA to execute this approach on a single account? I am not a coder, so not sure how to do it. But couldn't the SnapShot of Bids & Asks be put in as Global Variables and the EA will either place appropriate Buy Limits and Sell Limits or be ready to place appropriate Market orders?

Thanks for sharing.

Bruce

What is good tool if i want to take three pair or multi-pare i need to calculate the lot size manually according to pip value and spread difference. Is any one having excel sheet with formula

For example

AUD/USD -PIP Value =10$ for 1 LOT and Spread is (19)

AUD/NZD -PIP Value =10$ for 1.38   So Active LOT is= .71 LOT and Spread (86)  Spread Difference =-67

--- 帖子 #985 ---
As I mentioned before I did a very amateurish indicator codewise.. Just edit the code and enter your Pair names where you see the pairs.. Make sure those pairs are in marketwatch list...

Hi Samer,

Well, that is after you enter the basket trade though, not before. I needed to see what the basket is doing before entry.

Thanks though..

--- 帖子 #987 ---
I think folks need to be reminded that profit for a currency basket is not going to magically happen just because you've set up a triangle...no matter how many triangles are in the basket. If you are not perfectly hedge, then profit is ultimately going to depend on NET exposure and directional movement in favor of the Net exposed currency pair(s), as previously explained by Coder. Somewhere in your group of triangles you're going to be net long USD, CAD, GBP, JPY, CHF, EUR, AUD, and/or NZD, AND net short USD, CAD, GBP, JPY, CHF, EUR, AUD, and/or NZD. A "Buy" dominated basket is going to make money only if the movement of your hedge is in the direction of your NET long exposed currency(ies), and vice versa for a "Sell" dominated basket, which in essence is no difference than taking a directional trade with the net exposed single currency pair. There is no magic in a hedge, its simply math, no matter how complicated the setup is. If you were mathematically perfectly hedge, there would be no NET exposure which means there would be no means of profit.

FWIW, the link below is to a spreadsheet that I posted several years ago that shows the mathematical relationship between ALL of the major and cross currency pairs. The discussion within that link bears reading.

Hi Gold

what would happen if I were to SHORT when the indicator is at +100 and then it goes to 0, would it be a profitable trade?

--- 帖子 #989 ---
all correct to 100% what you say. but i think they cant see this. i tried to help them already, they look to new in trading , they cant see this effect. best is, they try it out and learn after some month/years reality in trading with hedge trades is same like doing the small unhedged exposure with much much smaller costs. you can teach some the basics, not all will understand it, and only 10% can really use it.

all rest is simple arbitrage trading, but because metacoder say they dont look for arbitrage, they really look for hedge win because of whatever reason they calculated.

at least its very easy to program and you dont need long time to invest , but simple using math to compare all first would help more.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Exactly Savan. The basket would end up in profit...

Both have to be downloaded..

There are 2 lines in the indicator. Blue line is the Long GBPUSD, Long NZDCAD, Long AUDNZD, Short GBPCAD, short AUDUSD. The red line is the opposite trades.

This indicator takes into consideration of the spread.

The difference of the 2 lines gives you how much spread you will pay when you enter. All based on 1 lot on each pair...

why I just discover this thread

There is no duplication of GBPCHF and CHFJPY.

It is:

Account 1
EURUSD - Sell
USDJPY - Sell
EURJPY - Sell
GBPJPY - Buy
EURGBP - Buy
EURCHF - Buy
GBPCHF - Buy
GBPUSD - Sell
USDCHF - Buy
CHFJPY - Buy

Account 2
EURUSD - Buy
USDJPY - Buy
EURJPY - Buy
GBPJPY - Sell
EURGBP - Sell
EURCHF - Sell
GBPCHF - Sell
GBPUSD - Buy
USDCHF - Sell
CHFJPY - Sell

You would set the gap per your judgment above ask or below bid where you want to enter for your sells and buys.

Potential profit isn't going to be large, tending to be limited as pairs get profitably hedged.  Only open one trade per pair per account.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
MetaCoder,

Thanks. I noticed that in your other post, but just wanted to be sure about it.

Is there a particular time of week and day that you have found that would be better to start a hedging cycle?

Bruce

--- 帖子 #996 ---
There probably is brucech, but all of the pairs need to move sooner or later and it's market movement we want.  I've been working with an EA and as I expected the very quiet times aren't good.  I don't know how it would do during  major news announcements.  But profit was available now several times in a row during late afternoon and early evening, USA Pacific time.

The pairs open up in no predictable order, just depends on what the market does once the anchors are set and the EA waits for the market to touch the buy and sell levels.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Thanks for the indicator GoldTheHun is very good... but  is possible without open day line? To see the real range of this hedge..

but in positiones you 3 times chf sell and one time buy? is true?

metacoder is doing the mistake in his example, i hope he is doing it correct in real trading, or he just will wonder why his basket wins/loss will move because of chf and usd still open with 4 positions ;-)..

as a tip: change the direction of usdchf to have chf and usd hedged, or you are with usd and chf still open 2 times each.

This is not hedging, the lot sizes are wrong

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
the problem is, they cant understand it, even when they use same size most cant see that there are still some  position rests open, and thatswhy the basket moves. would be much easier often to buy this rest and have same result with only much more win, at least if you dont want arbitrage trading.

in this example the rest position is of course bigger then normal.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
each pair have different pipDolarValue and it is about this pipDolarValue what is going on in this hedging strategy

when this value goes huge against you - you can end in nice DD with money (pipDolarValue is dynamic, depends)

truth is, you can be profitable as well as lossable, is not true, that "one time your trio goes into profit, just wait" - it is not true, it can be in loss years and loss can grow ...

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
true.it is  not without a reason when you see in the hedge/arbitrage topics most of the time beginners use it. its a strategy for beginners, sounds smart but after you calculated it by math correct its easy to see the problems. most beginners cant know the math or market basics, so they fall in love to this very easy. same time they dont learn how to trade really, and hold in topics they will only lose time. in my beginning i was so too. but at least got catched before put in to much time wasted.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
exactly, look here:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

chart is created on period 2011-2016 and shows price behaviour from combination BBS (blue) and SSB (red)

BBS: buy eurgbp, buy gbpusd, sell eurusd -- each 1 lot size

SSB: sell eurgbp, sell gbpusd, buy eurusd -- each 1 lot size

from this chart can be seen, that in some time trades portfolio can go from 2000 to -3500, and it is drawdown -5500 USD, and this down takes longer than 1 year for reverse - and when it reversed, another one side movement happend with opposite combination and take another one year to reverse

now somebody can argue, that you can take trades only in direction for profits - ok, but when you know this direction, you can take trades without hedging with more profits   (other combinations can create bigger DD, like JPY pairs, even -15000 with 1 lot size), and here are not calculated other fees like swap ...

as you said, a lot of people/traders falls into this systems for years and are holding positions for years, are multiplicating positions for small profits and are hoping, that those small profits cover losses - maybe, but as result a lot of work from huge drawdowns (because they are often multiplicated) ...

so people, dont be greedy into this strategy

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
@Miro1360,

This is exactly what I found when backtesting numerous triangular "hedges"... You could/would be stuck for years in a significant drawdown... and the small gains never covered the much larger losses due to the disproportionate pip moves between the three currencies. It is true that there were periods of profit taking, but more often than not, a large directional move by one of the three pairs would blow the "hedge" causing significant loss.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
thats normal, and by math its the normal result. you have much spread paid, and you have still 2 positions (rest parts overlapping) always open at minimum, and this 2 positions will show if you have win or loss on the end. of course swap and extra spread will give a a bad chance, and always when you won other will laugh about you because you could have same wins with less risk and cost much more easy by just open the unhedge position part.

its always good to help starters with math and market basics, but what they do with the basics and math, we cant decide. some like metacoder are so extrem catched in their mind , they dont have a chance to accept the reality. already some people tried to warn him about his mistakes, but he will ignore it (some he was even attacking) and even start blocking you. but such extrem beginners you will always see here, we cant help all starters. some need to learn on the hard way when dont know basics, dont know math and dont accept truth.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
His point was that it's a waste of time because if you completely and correctly hedge all units in the ring - you will only ever lose since the net swaps are always negative (didn't used to be that way) and the only way you are seeing any movement at all is because you aren't properly calculating lot sizes. This means you are x units long one currency and x units short another; effectively wasting capital paying for pointless swaps and tying up margin money for absolutely no reason. This is a terrible strategy for those reasons.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
the problem is, its total impossible to hedge it completely. you can hedge most parts, but small parts will still be open all the time. and this parts decide often the wins or loss.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
there is no way for something as "correctly hedge by calculating lot size" ... result from my tests in MT5 from multipair EAs based on these triangulars was, that 1:1:1 lot sizes are best for long term hedge/alive  when you start with calculating for different lot sizes with artifical formulas, you always move from hedge ring (for bigger profit or bigger loss) ...

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
After a few round trips on demo accounts with the 10-pair basket I've been discussing, it became clear a good strategy needs to be employed beyond simply opening trades when the targets are hit.

It's fine to recognize the connected triangles, but one shouldn't enter all available trades without some logical criteria.

After the first trade opens because the target was hit, I suggest excluding certain other trades from opening. For example, if the first trade is a GBPJPY sell, then do not open another trade that sells GBP and buys JPY until some hedging is in place. I could be much more specific because I worked out and implemented the exact logic for all 20 possible trades, but I'm going to keep this to myself for now.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
"Correct" lot sizes are only important if trying to hold the equity as steady as possible. I thought for a time that this was important, but in the several years I was away from developing EAs, I realized it doesn't make sense if the goal is to make money . With the strategy I've been working on, equal lot sizes on all pairs is the way to go.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
at least use a cent account or little real account, demo is just for testing code, testing strategy is complete useless, special arbitrage and hedging shows useless results.

just to help you save some month :-).

by the way: there are no secrets in hedging, all was done before in 1000 times better way. math is math. you can calculate the result of 2+2 as 10+20-26. but will this help.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Meditate on the mantra below. Pretend you are one of the possible 20 trades in the 10-pair super triangle I illustrated. You are a CHFJPY long. Or maybe you are a GBPCHF short. Doesn't matter which one you are, there are exactly six trades you don't want to see opened if you are not yet hedged.

Here is the mantra: "If I am not hedged in one of the four ways I can be hedged, then don't let any of these six trades open unless they would complete a hedge."

And you need to know for certain which six trades should not be opened depending on what trade you are. And you need to keep them from opening until you are hedged.

This is what I have worked out and implemented.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
This demonstrates a complete breakdown in the understanding of how forex works. Hedging in forex means that you are long and short an equal amount of units on each currency. So if you were to go long 1 std lot of EURUSD you'd have:

Inserted Code 100,000 units long EUR and ~114,000 short USD.
In order to hedge the EUR you'd need to go short EURGBP with 1 std lot to have:
Inserted Code 100,000 units short EUR and ~87,800 long GBP.

Therefore, in order to hedge the GBP/USD you would need to  Inserted Code short 87,800 units of GBPUSD, Which means you would automatically be long 114,000 units of USD.

What you are doing when you are not properly calculating lots sizes is NOT hedging. What you are doing is creating a synthetic position that ignores logic and creates a situation where you pay more to hold that trade.

In the above example, if you have a 1:1:1 lot like you suggest, you have a net position of  Inserted Code 12,200 long GBP and 16,000 short USD
This is the literal equivalent of taking a single long trade of GBPUSD @ 0.12 lots. Trader A: takes a synthetic position of 1:1:1 EURUSD,EURGBP,GBPUSD for a net position of 0.12 lots GBPUSD which cost (3 lots commission) + (3 lots* spread) + (3 lots * swap)+(3 lots * margin) Trader B: takes a 0.12 lot GBPUSD trade (same net position as trader A) which costs (0.12 lots commission) + (0.12 lots* spread) + (0.12 lots * swap)+(0.12 lots * margin)

Which is the smarter trader?

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
To further illustrate the point here is an overlay of GBPUSD during that same period. My scaling is a bit off (I'm no photoshop master)
Attached Image

As you can see the correlation is 100%, and thus I assert: The aforementioned "1:1:1 lot hedge" is the exact equivalent to 0.12 lot GBPUSD trade (*at today's current market pricing) .

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
good basic math. and swap is even not counted, or slippage, or offquotes, and and and ...

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
There are exactly two ways to benefit from this systemYou have direct access to multiple LPs and a setup that can send asynchronous orders in under a ~millisecond. This also requires proper calculation of the fractional product and lot sizes for entry. No arbitrary random entries. Interest rates of nations increase significantly to the point where you can be completely hedged in a ring while collecting net positive swaps. Anything else is a foolish waste of money.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
BTW, Oanda offers position sizes down to the unit. So practically speaking you actually can have an exact hedge. If/when swaps go more positive AND the CFTC increases the limits on leverage - that's where I'll be

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
the unit size is not the problem, this have many "real" brokers. but you calculated correctly, only in 1 currency you can hedge complete, but would be stupid, because always loss.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
That's not correct.

If I enter these exact lots at these exact prices for example:
Inserted Code 1 lot long of EURUSD @ 1.1400   Inserted Code 1 lot short of EURGBP @ 0.8700   Inserted Code 0.87 lot short of GBPUSD @ 1.31035

I would be completely hedged and my account equity would only fluctuate by pennies for the duration of the trade.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
ah, you speak about a trade without any spread for going in and out or some arbitrage in this time of opening and closing, and no commission and rollover.

then its only risky if you have to much value in it, and risk of margin call in fast market move by big news or flash crash.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
No... I'm not talking about arb or zero spreads or any of that business... I'm taking about entries at those prices. If I had a negative balance due to spreads going in the only fluctuations I would see in my account would be due to the widening of spreads, but other than that no fluctuations at all. (not accounting for swap)

The only way to have a margin call is if the spreads widen to the point of a complete account wipeout - we're talking super-shady-broker kind of event. A flash crash wouldn't create a margin call because you are hedged, such is the entire point of a hedge. Even my example holds up in a flash crash and would hold it's fluctuations to pennies once things settle down.

As far as roll-over goes, yes you would lose money *now*, but this wasn't always the case. Back in '05 up until rates changed... we were raking in sweet profits by arbing the swaps.

So it [was] possible [when interest rates were better] to have a completely hedged position that was entirely market-neutral while generating net positive roll-over. That was my point.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
1 margin call: correct and wrong same time maybe:

flash crash example:

if you have to much exposure, lets say even only eurusd buy and sell (for make it easy to calculate) you told correctly that only wipe out (margin call can kill account). and thats is what can happen when exposure is to high and some big news or flash crash happens. your hedging is worthless in this kind, but this ofcourse depends on the broker, how it will calculate your risk. when a normal broker will calculate the open positions, then you have 1 sell open and 1 buy. when there would be a extrem big spread in flash crash (maybe 500 pips in 2 seconds), then you have 500 pips minus exactly at this moment, because buy is 250 pips in minus and sell too.

so this can only be avoided by no big exposure and by broker will not count it this normal way (best is net it).

2. entry at this prices: thats not very often the case, if you put in slippage, commission (in spread ) and spread together, you would have EURGBP @ 0.8700 as ask value, but you need to sell with bid value. (by get arbitrage in this point you can wait until this sometimes happens, but still the slippage problem will have a risk in this, not to speak about ofquotes, connection problems,...)

its late for this theoretics, i hope it was possible to understand , and not to bad english.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Lot size equivalencies are the same as exchange rate equivalencies.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
1. By that logic you would also get a margin call if you were long/short (hedged) on the same pair.

2. I'm not talking about making money, I'm talking about fluctuations in a hedged position. If my position is net zero-units then the ONLY fluctuation in price is accounted for by the abnormal fluctuations in the spreads. So if I was -10.00 going into the position (spreads and commissions) then I will always be -10.00 in floating P&L (not accounting for swaps).

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
No... they are a function of exchange rates, but they are not equivalent.

counter currency units = base currency units * exchange rate

Hi everybody, I take some indicator from this thread (not joung: 2014) to show correlated pairs in action in overlay... I modify it and add some indicator of "spread" to evaluate divergence to the mean (with a Bollinger band).

I'm also trying to do it working with this ea with icustom function. But for some reason (maybe the number of calculation too high...), I obtain empty value...

Could someone have a look to this code?

1. aehmm yes. my example was with only long/short in one pair. i would never do so, i simple open net positions to have smallest risk with minimal costs.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Maybe there's a language barrier here... We both agree that hedging is a waste of money. I'm asking theoretically, how is it possible to get a margin call when your net position size is zero?

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
yes, theoretic not possible, but in real account possible because of this situations.

and yes, we have both exact same that someone waste money with hedging, at least wasting many many many time.

you did all 100% correct, my answer was only to addon, that it can be a margincall in reality, when to high exposure and broker will count positions as seperate positions each and some event with big spread will happen.

look the screen, the equity from tf h4 is completely different to the daily!!! (notice near the white square, is 14 gen 2015).

if i buy the same sets at 14 gen 2015, at 17-18th i will must have the same results, not -200 usd or +5 if tf is h4!!!

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
welcome more guys to here discuss this thread.

by testing, i know the 3 pairs hedge is working. now i post a ea, please test.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
the purpose of 3 pairs hedging is to reduce DD, and then  gain pips.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Please do.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Hi Lghr,

Thanks for the EA.  Could you please explain the use of the EA?  Does it take trades? I have attached to a chart but not actions as of yet.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Hi, please be patient waiting, when condition reach, it will open.

my suggestion, you can set to GBP, such as GBPUSD, NZDUSD, GBPNZD, etc.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Great.  Thanks.

Could you put an option for Magic Number?

Thanks.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
The "M" in option is Magic Number.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Foolish me! I should have figured that!  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Sure, the arithmetic for lot sizes includes exchange rates, but the main point is that exchange rates are simply fractions with one currency the numerator and the other the denominator.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
I have put two EAs on, but after 3 days still no entries.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
It's a safe EA...just one trade yearly

THIS IS NOT HEDGONG cash4u2
HEDGING:
TOTAL PIP VALUE=0
TOTAL MARGIN = 0

THERE ARE COMPLICATED EQUATIONS TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE LOTS FOR ECH PAIR.

IF U R ARABIC, U CAN READ MY TOPIC HERE EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED THOROUGHLY
http://forum.arabtrader.com/t240307.html

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Maybe an explanation for non arabic people....many thx

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Read here. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post10040969

If that still doesn't make sense here is a more thorough explanation https://www.kreslik.com/forums/neoti...ble-hedge-t307

THIS SYSTEM IS NOT HEDGING. This system opens (ignorant) synthetic positions that waste money. This is the worst system on FF because it looks intelligent on the surface but once you get to the core of it - you are opening huge positions to create very small synthetic positions. If you like tying up margin cap and needlessly wasting money on Swaps, commissions, and spreads then this system is for you!

On a side note I made a position calculator since nobody seems to really know exactly why this system is such a waste of time and money.

If you are using this system, run this script to print out what your net position really is.

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
1 = (A/B)(B/C)...(n/A)

That doesn't share equivalency in lot calculation; two entirely separate functions.

How this system is supposed to be traded is when (A/B)*(B/C)*(C/A) = significant deviance from 1 = arbitrage. How you trade said arbitrage is by entering with net 0 units on all currencies. When rates return to 1 you'll be in profit.

Retail traders cannot trade this system because HFT firms spend millions on infrastructure to get this risk-free profit faster than you.

This thread is trading this system wrong on 2/2 criteria.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
There are a bunch of different systems being discussed on the thread and I think you just want to be seen as the one who tells everyone else they're wrong.  Due to the nature of fractions, lot sizes and exchange rates are tied together inextricably in a system where you're trying to keep equity as stable as possible.  You clearly understand this but that doesn't mean others don't understand it just as well.

I don't see anyone seriously proposing trying find arb opportunities in their hedging triangles.  I wrote an EA years ago that monitors a couple dozen triangles for any exploitable deviations, so I understand all of this very well.  There are precious few deviations / distortions / arb opportunities to exploit, and those that occur are very fleeting.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
The main mistake -I- see, if trying to make money from synthetic hedges, is in opening the trades for all 3 pairs at the same time.  If you do that, you might as well size the lots the same for every pair because that will create the possibility of getting into profit, but when it happens, it'll just be by luck.  Your triangle could also stay negative for quite a long time.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
there are three currencies YYY, XXX and ZZZ

and Dominating currency is DDD

M1: ,Margin for pair 1 named YYYXXX

M2: ,Margin for pair 2 named YYYZZZ

M3: ,Margin for pair 3 named XXXZZZ

P1: ,PipValue for pair 1 named YYYXXX

P2: ,PipValue for pair 2 named YYYZZZ

P3: ,PipValue for pair 3 named XXXZZZ

To get accurate balancing: the net should sum to zero.

M1+M2+M3=0

P1+P2+P3=0

we know FROM GENERAL RULES that:

P1=Lots1*XXXDDD ----- M1=C*Lots1*YYYDDD

P2=Lots2*ZZZDDD ----- M2=C*Lots2*YYYDDD

P3=Lots3*ZZZDDD ----- M3=C*Lots3*XXXDDD

so e have 3 variables: Lots1, Lots2 and Lots3.

it is impossible to profit in this way (hedhing at the sa,e time)

no way to profit at all. always loss

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
That's what this system is all about, "Three pairs hedging". If you have offsetting units then you're creating a negative carry trade where you lose money on swaps and fees. Like I said before the only way to profit from this system is to find net positive swap rings, and I haven't seen that for a very long time. If anyone is proposing any other way to profit from this system other than swap arb or pricing arb, then I will assert that there is a better and lower cost way to achieve the same net position.

Metacoder, at the present moment the only benefit of this system (that I see) is for the brokers to make more money. How is opening multiple offsetting positions in any way beneficial to the trader?

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Also, why would you open 1:1:1 lot EU,EG,GU trade when you could just open a 0.12 lot GU trade? It's literally the same thing without all the exorbitant fees.

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
you are one of few understand the math secrets behind these matters

1:1:1 on three pairs are actually single position on one pair. (plus more spreadds)
0,12 spread losses is very much less than 3 lot spreads losses
so: This is an enough prove that Hedging is very stupid idea

This was all explained nicely within the first 10 pages of the thread. People (not you) are obviously too lazy to read it, or just choose to ignore it hoping it is their pie in the sky system. It will pop up again in a few months with some other dolt thinking he has it all figured out. Rinse and repeat.

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
believe the others. your arb ea coded is this basic, any programmer in first weeks is doing this, and is learning that you never should use demo accounts or you will end with your problem, holding many weeks and months with useless ideas. if you would really hear about more experienced people here (at least as long you are  new in trading and need to learn market basics and understand math in best way) you would saved so much time. you think all you do has not done 100000 people before you.

and the most crazy thing. when i did wrote you this some time ago, you told me you will win not from arbitrage and i dont understand your system....., now it looks you dont have any more then arbitrage.... you really have to learn at least what you do.... you will lose so muchg time, on the end you will tell the people you speak all the time about demo account trades, then you cant talk with people from real account trading, because your have complete different knowledge.

that you think " I don't see anyone seriously proposing trying find arb opportunities in their hedging triangles." is crazy, because many tried this already, they was only smarter to give up more early, you check is slower. you can say your sentence also "i dont see anyone trying to jump so high he will jump till the moon....".

you simple want use arbitrage trading, and this will not work in reality this big, why not concentrate on real trading? why holding on this beginner startegies, that look good in first sight, but with learning market basics and math looks just time wasting?

Today cad hailed against all today!i took against it nice basket.

If the trades are not opened at the same time but rather individually when the market comes to levels that would make the basket of trades profitable, is the approach I'm in favor of.

HI guys!

I made a multi spread trading indicator and EA wich open/close on fast/low Moving average cross...

It's not optimized and profitable now... have you some idea to be more profitable?

Add indicator and EA on the same grapgh with the same settings.... (same pairs of currency etc)

Thanks!

Cheers...

This document and the associated indicator are only for educational purposes, and should not be used on real-money accounts. My aim is to "improve" and "understand" what we do with Spread Trading and not to use "eyes closed" signals.

Updates:

30/06/17: Expansion calculation update for those backs that have an anti-correlated symbol ..

07/13/07: Added weighing calculations for sale and buy

Current Version: SpreadOverlay2

What does it do?You can view the overlay of the 3 symbols on the same chart with the "relative" price calculation (reduced to proportions, example ... current opening price / opening price at the beginning of the day) Visually check if they are related and anti-correlated without mathematical calculation (ie see if they follow the same variations) Track a "spread" curve as the average of the maximum deviations between 3 symbols with relative prices. (Equation in brief ... = (Max (delta1-2; delta3-1) + Max (delta1-2; delta2-3) + max (delta3-2; delta3-1) / 3. The more the spread is big The greater the divergence. Calculate Weighing and Selling Weights: You can enter (manually) when the curves return inside the BBs to recover a gain

installation: Load the indicator into MQL4 / Indicator and update the indicator list Enter symbol names and correlations ("1" or "-1") for each single chart ... Attention correlations can change over time ... Example Time for EUR-SUI-SPX ... EURUSD: 1 SUI30: - 1 SPX500: -1. Instead EURUSD will be 1 and USDCHF -1 because EUR is at the numerator and the other at the denominator ... Correlations cor1 cor2 cor3 are to be checked periodically (every day) by increasing the TMFrame to 1H see if you follow the curves if you do not move from 1 to -1 to reverse some

Weight calculation example to enter the position (done automatically by the indicator)

Imagine that EURUSD drops faster than the other two AUDUSDs and USDCHFs.

In this case, you could come in as follows:

Buy EURUSD and sell AUDUSD and USDCHF (for example, the following calculation with Price Ask (if you sell) and Bid (if you buy) and lot volume (for currencies is always equal, but changes for indexes (see "Specifications" for each Symbol in MT4)

How does it work?

To get into position, the spread IMA fast and slow has to cross over...

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
MetaCoder,

Can you post a real example please ? thx.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
If you are speaking about divergence ( delay) between pairs I can tell you I writed in cffp thread an idea about that using that tool a few days ago. But my idea is not using triangle breakouts. It's more like a filter for avoid fake movements. Anyways maybe this don't fits with your idea...

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Here is a three-pair (in the spirit of the thread title) example.

Take a snapshot of any triangle's exchange rates at any point in time. Here is a snaphot from today's quotes for one of many triangles.

EURUSD bid 1.13974 ask 1.13989

GBPUSD bid 1.29212 ask 1.29221

EURGBP bid 0.88203 ask 0.88212

Call this snapshot your anchor if you want. It remains your anchor until your next trade setup. The anchor is the basis for setting your entry targets, to be discussed shortly.

There are two triangles here if you consider both directions for each pair.

There is buy EURUSD, sell GPBUSD, sell EURGBP. There is also sell EURUSD, buy GPBUSD, buy EURGBP.

Do not open these trades all at one time. No, WAIT for good entry points. Buy low, sell high.

For buy EURUSD, sell GPBUSD, sell EURGBP, look for entry levels like:

EURUSD ask 1.13954

GBPUSD bid 1.29241

EURGBP bid 0.88232

For sell EURUSD, buy GPBUSD, buy EURGBP, look for entry levels like:

EURUSD bid 1.14009

GBPUSD ask 1.29192

EURGBP ask 0.88183

The buy targets are a couple of pips below the anchor bids, and the sell targets are a couple of pips above the anchor asks.

Hi adegard,

Is it possible to create Zscore mean ration for three pair or two pair.

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
it sums to one position??

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
You could look at it that way, yes.  There is no assurance all of the trades will be opened per the entry targets.

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
How is this a benefit? It's not tri-arb so the idea of an "edge" is out the window... You're just scalping and you're taking risk off by adding offsetting units instead of just closing out your trades.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Wrong. Just flat wrong. It goes without saying that you close when in profit.  The benefit is that you are highly likely to get profitably hedged, and in fact this is what happens.

I've implemented an EA that trades this approach with 10 pairs in both directions across two accounts.

If you've done the same with even just 3 pairs, we can have a discussion.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
thats most stupid way to trade. i dont know, maybe you are extrem new in coding and trading. but you tell people they should wait for good entry points to buy low and sell high? really? then they could easy open only this entries and close this, would be same, more cheap more win. you do trading in most difficult way with most possible small win? and this you cant see by logic and mathematic and need to be even coding ? you really have to work on the basics of trading and market. or you will get many problems and waste many many time and jump from one system to an other, because you dont understand the basic rules, whats possible to do, whats useless.

there is one famous sentence, you should really start to read each day. "improve what you can, accept what you cant change, and learn to differ between both." its maybe the most important thing you can do.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
you have done all in (demo  or real account ?) account and get less win then anyone doing same without the hedge? but you prove only you are good in getting less win? that is your goal?
Nicholishen told you already the correct math behind your trades (its really scalping with high costs), but you ignore all because of whatever reason. maybe you are to young and cant see how so many try to help you.

if you do a win, and same time all other get more win with less costs and risk, why is then you system good? all depends on the time, to buy low and sell high, thats what any system will do. and i really hope you test it in real account , if not, then your demo results are even complete worthless.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
10 pairs opens you up to many more possibilities for getting into profit. Your first, second and third trades can be losers and you can still close in profit. As I mentioned before, you can preclude exactly six possible specific trades for every unhedged open trade, unless any one of those trades would complete a hedge. That's just one possible approach.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
you told the people, you buy low and sell high, and dont buy all same time, you will wait for this situations,. so you dont buy all same time and have risk open until all trades are open. if trades go against you until all are open you will have loss and are not hedged, and loss will start getting higher and higher.

so small win (what could be higher with reducing costs) against big loss (what could be same like trading normal trades, only smaller value).

maybe you should start at the beginning, you try to calculate more complex situations, and dont know basics in forex math, thats not best starting way.

maybe you should paint you all on paper , what your hedge does against seperate only trades. maybe you will find your mistake more fast.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Hi Comeback2000, what do you mean exactly? sorry I don't know it.

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Look, I'm not saying that a system based off the math behind tri-arb is not without merit, but the reality is that no matter what your strategy, if you're holding offsetting units in your forex account and it's not arb or positive carry trade then you're either screwing yourself or you're screwing your investors, period.

I'm going to leave this thread alone for now, but I'll leave it with something constructive. Did you know you can use the same formula to plot synthetic pivot points?

Inserted Code C/A = 1/((A/B)*(B/C))
Where A/B and B/C are the daily pivot points instead of bid/ask

Goodluck, all.

Lechuzon,

Here are the results so far for 5 pairs hedging.  But it seems to be going only in one direction for profit. If I reverse trades then goes into DD.  How can we know when it would go in opposite direction?  Any insight you can share?

Bruce

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Did you bother to calculate your net position before jumping in this trade? Your net position is 0.5 lot short USDCAD and 0.06 lot short NZDCAD. So you're long CAD. How much did the commissions, spreads, and swaps cost you to get in this 5 lot trade? ...because you could've had the same position with 0.56*fees instead of 5*fees.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---

personally i prefer hedging more than from 5-7 pair

2. I am not getting how to apply The EA and EXE4 downloads provided by you. which application is supporting Ex4?

3. I wanted such application which can automatically buy and sell when trade reach certain amount profit? Please provide if any in market?

4. The same logic of 3 pairs i am trying in demo account of forex.com since last few days but its showing negative with around 10% lose. i agree that risk is low but in easy way to have more profit? I am ok with less profit but assured profit.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
not good EA,that correlation of 3 pairs doesn't work most of the time,i used it and found drawdowns more than winners until you use EU,EU buy buy and UsdChf sell or vice versa but 3 pairs idea doesn't work IMHO

Bump!

I do three leg hedge and can offer some newbie help as to how it works.

A hedge is expected to be neutral. Minor profit or drawdown is incidental to the intention. A hedge ought to be entered to preserve an existing substantial position, then exited when no longer required. Example: Your NAV is evaporating in a trade, so you hedge the trade until funds can land in your account in two days time, then exit the hedge and let the market ravish your account again until the trade turns around. This allows you to commit to your analysis or gives you time out to rethink instead of pulling the pin.

If using lots to make money, you are stuck with determining BBS or SSB. This is because lot sizes are not equal. Because they are not equal the pairs each have small exposures. The individual small exposures will collectively generate either a profit or drawdown depending on which direction the hedge is entered. Unfortunately it is essentially an expensive way of profiting from a tiny exposure. The profitable pair exposed in the hedge could be better utilised as a stand alone traded lot. A greater profit with less cost.

Using $ units instead of lot sizes offers a lot more flexibility and utility. Another post.

Cheerio chaps.

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
I have some suggestions to improve this system:

1.

Create a 'fake' hedge basket, and wait till it goes down in drawdown, then open a real basket in the same direction.

2.

Do this basket hedge across 3 brokers. 1 pair on each. Calculate the arbitrage. Enter when loosely/strongly correlated and direction of trade should follow that.

3.

Or just look at FPI level and enter when it is at peaks (see below).

Hi Lonestar, I was curious about why this happened and how I could find the exposure pair in triangles ?

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
my primary method of trading is hedging...

- i have experimented with a three pair hedge...on one such experiment, i simply opened the hedged, in a live oanda account, and then watched. i watched the 3 pair hedge move from profit, to draw down, and back again...without ever having to anything...all while keeping my overall draw down at a manageable level.

so, it does work, if done correctly...with real money, in a live account, it works.

Hello sir does this still work? We need to sell or buy at certain level like support and resistance?

i am using  GBPCHF-sell    gbpusd-buy   USDCHF-buy     1 lot per pair for10000 $ account.i will withdraw profit regularly

I am quite sure the only way out to take profit from this system is by getting benefit from positive swaps when they exist.

hi dear i am back again to forex world after many months

this EA still running and hope i will find its solution

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Hello...

do you really need an EA..? or can this be done manually..(at a consistent level)..?

I know this is kinda of an old thread....still hope to get an answer.

thank you

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
There are six pair in EA so to be remove last two?

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
he probably didn't dig deep enough into the possibilities.

Well, the three-pair hedging option works, just not in all groups.

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
well the costs are really against us, swap, spread but even so we can profit with the hedge strategy.

you just have to find the right settings.

i read that many people claim that this kind of hedge doesn’t work but interestingly i use it and it works for me.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
I'm glad someone is using this method, I'd like to carry this thread forward ...

personally the only way not to lose in trading, in DEMO I doubled the capital, obviously in real, the size is small 0.07 ... but I covered a big drawdown .... matured with common trading systems ....

then to those who persist in saying that it is better to exchange a pair .... I say to think of the drawdawn

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Iv recently learned of this method. I'm a okeyish developer and will code a 3 pair strategy.

The ones iv built so far suffers huge drawdown so I guess I'm doing something wrong. Regarding the spreads in the previous comments, you can get a 100% free swap account these days so that solves the problem.

Pm or anyone interested continue in this thread

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
Okey here is a 10 pair experimental EA for anyone interested to test it out. I have given the user a lot of control from being able to choose the lotsize for each symbol. The way i have created is with 2 Major Pairs and its cross pairs.

EURUSD Cross Pairs: EURCAD,EURCHF,EURJPY,EURNZD
AUDUSD Cross Pairs: AUDCAD,AUDCHF,AUDJPY,EURAUD

All cross pairs have the same amount of lot (your free to test) and the main symbol has the sum of all its cross pairs.

Iv created two ways to trade the symbol. The first being with a filter. Standard MACD Crossover with a 200 MA and the second way is just entering at the market at whatever session time you had chosen.

If you want to use 1 major pair with its crosses only with no filter, that too is possible by turning off the second hedge filter.

There are two ways to close trades.  With standard SL and TP or with a fixed unrealized profit value which you can set for yourself. When choosing that simply change your SL and TP to 0.

The close trade by weekend options closes trades on END HOUR on Friday. You have the option to choose that as well.

Keep in mind this is a experimental ea and im posting this here to see who shows interests and is willing to contribute. This EA SHOULD NOT BE TRADED IN LIVE ACCOUNT.

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
I am an index trader.

Can  I trade 6 pairs of index (5 digits) and 2 pairs of FX (5 digits)?

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
Yes. I haven't tried with this ea. But previous ones I did try us index and eurusd

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
Right now, upon buy signal, major pair buys and all cross pairs sells and the oppersit.

But when using it without the filter, it will only place 1 trade per symbol. I haven't tested throughly enough to check if if it's 1 buy and 1 sell per pair or just 1 open trade per pair

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Below is one more of my experimental eas which i built with the intention of trading Correlation Coefficient. Iv tried various methods from buying with one pair and selling with another etc and they all have one thing in common. The price may goes against you. Im still in the middle of developing news ways such as a triangular correlation with entries at different timeframes at overbought and oversold levels.

Anyways as mentioned above the issue the i always had was with price going against me and suffering huge drawdowns and after scratching my head for days i realized use pending orders was much efficient so decided to implement a grid a system into that.

After testing different methods from using buy/sell limit/stop with different variations and grid levels, i came to the conclusion that the best method of choosing the grid was based on daily ATR.

Im still developing and testing but i wanted to see how much floating drawdown il have so below is a backtest for 1 year with GBPUSD and GOLD.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The EA will place 25 buy/sell stop/limit orders at both direction and will not place any new grids.

In this backtest i choose a profit target of $50 to close the trades. Upon closing the trade, all previous grids gets deleted and new one is placed at the current price.

The maximum holding time during a dd was 17 days.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Below is the result. The values are not optimal since im pretty sure i can use a higher profit target/grid to lower DD and increase profits or maybe use carry trades to benefit from swap.

Hi vonmunchy

I would like to highlight what I think is a design flaw in your ea "All cross pairs have the same amount of lot (your free to test) and the main symbol has the sum of all its cross pairs."
The $value of a lot between different base pairs are different.  So making entries for grouped cross pairs with the same lot size means you have different amounts of money values on different currency pairs.  As price moves this will become a factor.  When price is moving in favor of the lot $ bias created by having all currency pairs of the cross pair grouping of equal lot value you will make your profit target quicker.  But when it is on the other side you will go deeper into drawdown.  It is defeating the logic of this hedging strategy in my view.
I suggest lot sizes should be calculated by ADR, PIP $ value for each currency pair in the hedged cross grouping so it is a level playing field.

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
Yes, that's why I gave the option to set lot size manually and that's a side project I built for anyone interested in checking past performance of different correlated pairs. My last post, the grid EA is one of the two main systems I'm developing.

Feel free to pm me if anyone wants to take part in backtesing and finding ways to improve the system.

The second system is based on 3 pairs that sells and buys at overbought zones at 3 different timeframes

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
very interesting concept, it works on something similar. I applied this to the nasdaq index with a slight modification to the order opening times. very interesting result. I think it can be refined to perfection. You only need an automatic way of counting the distance between orders.

looking into a version the 3-way hedge system. how do you find the correct pairs to trade at the right time so to say?

let's say you see a "setup " usdjpy -gbpusd- gpyjpy or usdjpy-eurusd- eurjpy . which would you pick and why?

eurusd buy

usdjpy buy

eurjpy sell

what if eurusd looks a clear sell at that time and still room to go down. would you sell and buy at support for example? or just stick buy, buy sell

it will come down to your experience with forex correlation. There several options to choose from and the correlation of pairs always changes and how well if something works or not is based on back tests that you do yourself

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
if i may ask:

do you look at a correlation graph? Forex Correlation | Myfxbook before placing a trade.  what do i need to see to pick the "correct pairs"?

or you can really see on the chart that the price is not in line between the pairs.

is it useful to use a strength meter. what do I need to see or not see if i want to trade eurusd-usdjpy-eurjpy

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
maybe you misunderstood. I provided a ea for you test out different paris on your own with the entry of trade based on macd which i already explained when i posted the ea.

you can take what you said into consideration when trading manually or a ea thats built around that and mine is a simple macd cross over

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Thanks will test this out and tell ya how it goes.

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
I used to be a regular on the forex factory forums but I have not posted for years. I am interested with hedging and spread trading strategies.

1. Can you make a Metatrader 4 version of the EA since many brokers don't offer MT 5 yet and many traders have not switched over?

2. I would point out that the AUD hedge should not include the EURAUD pair. For example if you Buy AUDUSD you must sell the other 4 AUD pairs. But if you include EURAUD you are selling EUR and buying AUD instead of selling AUD. I know that it can be changed in the EA so do you agree that the AUDNZD should replace EURAUD?

Looking forward to your reply and the Metatrader 4 version if possible.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Sure

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
sorry seems like i need to rebuild it from scratch. i thought i could convert it but its from mq4 to mq5. Reason why i dont want spend time on it right now is because you cant backtest multi pairs in mt4 if there was a working system in mt5 than sure its worth it to convert it to mt4

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Can you please share this EA with me please?

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Hi Vonmuncy, have you got any further on the Ea?any new alterations? how can i test this on other pairs like gold and stocks? thank you

Hi again, Could you share this mt5 EA in mq5 ? I would appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
hello.......i know this is an old thread, but is it still holding up...?

also if you're 'hedging'....means no SL..??? just TP....??

thanks

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
hi Metacode, would you have that as an Mt5 EA to test? Thank you

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
Hey, guys

I don't speak english forgive the mistakes.

I was thinking..

GBP/USD - BUY 0.07    (I try to enter in favor of the gbp/usd trend)

GBP/CHF - SELL 0.05

USD/CHF - BUY 0.05

Close when a pair is in profit. and open the same position again.

I start at the frankfurt session Because it usually indicates a false trend. In other words, I can close winning trades and recover the ones that are below until the London and New York session.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
This strategy is completely harmful. Admin, Please eliminate the thread. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
my cousin made this table with the possible ratio of 2:1 in each set (two lines on top of each other). where there might be 2 winners and 1 loser or 2 losers and 1 winner. at least we think it is like this. my request to him was that we avoid the 3:0 scenario where there can be 3 winners vs 0 losers and the other way around 3 losers vs 0 winners.

we are gonna demo test the dependencies in the triangle. as it may happen so that 1 winner vs 2 losers might not bring any money in the house, but highly likely will keep the account around the watermark line, me is pretty optimistic this will happen exactly as expected. the 2 winners vs 1 loser needs no attention, as it is all clear...

please, let me know, if you find any mistake in our grouping here:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

here is an example of a winner:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and a loser (both with the winner are trading under the exact same directional logic. one is a buy and the other is a sell)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

the idea is to keep a gap between the winner and the loser bigger than 2:1. anything higher than that, makes it all happen...

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
If you wish to avoid all combos that have 3 wins or 3 losses you need to understand a bit of simple math and use it to calculate the triangular relationship between the base pairs so you can work out the appropriate formulas for 2 wins/losses vs 1 loss/win.

I'll just do the calculations for the currencies EUR GBP JPY

(if you divide the JPY denominated pairs by 100 to get a common scale it will simplify things if you actually calculate the spreads)

base pairs: EUR/GBP, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY. You can solve for each pair creating 3 equations:
Inserted Code 1) EUR/GBP = EUR/JPY / GBP/JPY
2) GBP/JPY = 1/EUR/GBP * EUR/JPY or just EUR/JPY / EUR/GBP
3) EUR/JPY = EUR/GBP * GBP/JPY
If you convert to log prices, multiplication becomes a plus sign, and division becomes a minus sign.
Inserted Code 1) EUR/GBP = EUR/JPY - GBP/JPY
2) GBP/JPY = -EUR/GBP + EUR/JPY
3) EUR/JPY = EUR/GBP + GBP/JPY
The formulas above are the only ways to offset 2 wins/losses against 1 loss/win for the currencies EUR, GBP, JPY. Let's rewrite so all terms are on the left and set equal to zero.
Inserted Code 1) EUR/GBP + GBP/JPY - EUR/JPY   = 0
2) GBP/JPY + EUR/GBP - EUR/JPY  = 0
3) EUR/JPY - EUR/GBP - GBP/JPY  = 0
Formulas 1) and 2) are the same with terms in different order. So you either have positive/negative EURJPY against the other two pairs. The three formulas above simplify to these two:
Inserted Code a) - EUR/JPY + EUR/GBP +GBP/JPY  = 0 (SBB)
b) EUR/JPY - EUR/GBP - GBP/JPY  = 0    (BSS)
So referring back to the graphic you posted, only rows 1 and 2 of EUR GBP JPY are applicable. Your cousin will have to work out the rest for the other currency combinations, but you will find that there will just be two formulas on each triangle that will end in a 2 vs 1 scenario. Good luck!

Hi Erpthetrader,

Are you testing that strategy? I'd watching already this video but I don't understand.

Second Step - If positions are at a loss then am I open 3 positions(sell, buy, buy) or 1(which pairs?) position?

I'm testing now.

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Please do let us know the outcome

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
I watched the YouTube video. What i understood that, we can use indicators like RSI or Stochastic. When all the three pairs are in sync in terms of the indicator, it takes the trade. Correct me if i am wrong here...  the logic in the video is not using any correlation data of the three pairs. So I do not think that buying their service will work.

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
Good morning everyone. Where can I find this indicator? Can anyone post it? thank you

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
If anybody is doing this or still doing this style of trading, what do you pay attention to before opening a three pair hedge trade? There must be some factor that plays a role regarding whether the trade (the three pair hedge) will yield a positive result or not, faster or later, etc.. I cannot imagine that opening at any price at any time of the day would work.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
well yes

you can't just open the trade. the pairs used must be in the right position.

and not all 3-pair combinations are suitable for trading. because when tested back in history, the profit curve must perform a smooth wave movement.+/-.

good luck with your testing.

Except that this is not hedging in the usual sense of hedging a losing buy or sell position on the same pair or commodity as you mentioned Gold.

It is trading the pairs created by 3 currencies which would generally move in the same or opposite direction depending on the strength of either 1, 2 or all 3.

Maybe offsetting is a better description word?

I use the 3-pair hedging strategy, but I only trade one pair, only the leading pair.

I now have a pedaáúl usd/cad short position.

you have to be very aware of the 3 pair trading options because otherwise you will only lose..

for me, the position of the 3 pair is only an indicator of the possibility of the leading pair.

for example, in the case of eur/gbp-eur/usd-gbp/usd, gbp/usd is the leading pair.

Hi Guys...i was reading what you posted here and wanted to help you dedicate correct lot sizes for Multipair Hedging... you problem that you not understand that every pair have separate COST OF PIP (MQL language already have standart function to check Cost of 1 Pip at any pair).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples of pip value calculation: https://www.mql5.com/ru/forum/380536

Pip calculator : https://www.forextime.com/trading-to...pip-calculator

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of Triangle Hedging for EURUSD + GBPUSD + EURGBP:

You can open 2 different multipair Hedging triangle at this 3 pairs (the color of first currency in pair will give you direction sell or buy ) :
1) EURUSD + GBPUSD + EURGBP
2) EURUSD + GBPUSD + EURGBP

There are three main types of online pricing:
- direct currency quote (base currency comes first: only USD, EUR, AUD or NZD);
- reverse quotation (the first is the national currency of any other state, except for those listed above)
- cross rate (pair without US dollar).

In our example we have direct currency quotes: EURUSD + GBPUSD and Cross: EURGBP
If you open 1 lot at EURUSD and 1 lot at GBPUSD and you need to hedge EURGBP - the lot size at EURGBP will be same as current quote at cross EURGBP = 0.87 Lot:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Finally we have:

1) 1 sell EURUSD + 1 buy GBPUSD + 0.87 buy EURGBP
2) 1 buy EURUSD + 1 sell GBPUSD + 0.87 sell EURGBP

But remember if you do multipair hedging at 3 or more pairs you just Lock equity in minus from opened spread and will never receive profit or bigger loss as you have from start point, no matter which way pairs will go after that, onlything you will pay is Swaps, but  what the point do so ?
If someone can explaine how to make profit and strategy based at this, or if you already posted it in this thread - link me to it, because i not found anything interesting or correct from my vision ...i will help make correct calculation in lot zises and code it in robot.
Have a good profit!

This is how I see this. This is not a triangular arbitrage system because it's not perfectly hedged. A perfectly hedged system can guarantee you a profit no matter how market moves. But it's only profitable when the profit is bigger than spreads+trading costs.

Since it's not a perfectly hedged system. I could only say this method is trading the correlation between two groups. It's not too different from two pairs correlation actually.

Here comes an example:

GBPUSD = Buy 1 lot

USDCHF = Buy 1 lot

GBPCHF = Sell 1 lot

What you actually do is trading one group against the other.

GBPUSD+USDCHF = A group

GBPCHF = B group

In this case, you are trading the correlation between these two groups. Then, it all comes back to the basics: spread trading. Since it's not a perfectly hedged system, the correlation between two groups is not 1. It's the contract size ratio between two groups. Also, the correlation is not a constant value. It fluctuates and this is what you trade.

p.s. The fluctuation comes from imperfect hedge. Your A group could be transferred to x lot size of GBPCHF + y lot size of GBPUSD or USDCHF. x size of GBPCHF balance GBPCHF in B group and the rest is why it fluctuates.

Hope it make sense to you guys.

Hi, I'm still a newbie tho I was asking wat if I hedge two negatively correlated pairs instead of adding the third one, how wud that come out??

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
An old but very interesting thread. Gone through the whole thread in the last couple of days. Without commenting on what I read, my understanding  of the strategy is that we need to figure out when to go for BBS and when for SSB for a particular triangular combination. Did anyone get any breakthrough in figuring that out?

Thanks

I find the concept of hedging interesting. I have tried this particular strategy and have found that it is profitable, if you are on the right side of a trend. If you are on the wrong side, losses are great. There are times when all 3 pairs can be either be + or -, therefore not truly showing a correlation. The issue of identifying the trend and therefore purposely choosing BBS or SSB would be the answer - but then one would ask, if you identified the trend, why not just trade that pair directly?

Did u find out, anything about the strategy?

does someone have any idea of what the strategy could be from the statement uploaded...

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
Hi

I have redone the Idea with many hours work for MT5. For the moment, until we found working setups, for Demo Accounts only.

Happy testing.

I recomends and hints:

default settings are already not so bad.

Avoid *USD* they jumps because the indices US30, NQ etc.

you can try only 2 pairs as well.

you can try US30&NQ an be surpriced.

from my experience, time matters. work with tradewindows.

General: many setups and strategies working only in small tradewindows

I improved some code. Please use this Version.

Feedback is welcome.
