Hi guys, Here is my perfected system, since my last post titled GBPUSD scalp method, i stop posting cos i am too busy finding my trading system weakness, here is the fact My system works on GBPUSD only....well at this time (cos i dont have time testing in any other pairs) I use basic indicators none of them modified or programmed, so feel happy to test it and post comments i use MT 3.83 set chart : GBPUSD 5m 15m 1H view it on tile vertically three of them on 5m set indicator : three EMA 3 5 21,(parabolic sars and Bollinger bands ===&gt; accessories only) and William Percentage range ( period 14 ) same on 15m chart But on 1H chart i use MA as in sidus method as trend indicator and william percentage range Trick of the trade : 1H is for temporary today trend 5m and 15m for very short term ( just to see the beginning of the trend) watch for the crosses Mainly i use combination of William Percentage Range on three time frame (it takes time to master it) Open sell if 1H william head down direction, followed by 15m and 5m (above 25 line) take your profit if 15m william reach under 75 line and starts to head up Open buy if 1H william head up and followed by 15m and 5m (below 25) take your profit if 15m william reach above 25 line If you get lucky u can have 20 to 100 pips per day begining european session Right now i manage to be constanly earn 20 pips a day still have a lot to explain my system, i use money management as well there are still a lot to explain, any question would be great Happy Trading never had a loss trade again ever....

Thank you for sharing your system with us! Could you post a chart for better understanding of entry rules? And please clarify your stoploss levels if you're using them. Thank you in advance!

Hi, Thank you for sharing your system with us! Just like TheThing said, it would be great if there is a screen shoot of your system. Thanks

hello jogja trader.. nice setup.. i hope you will share your template maturnuwun sanget , DAB !! weleh weleh

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Nice to have your comment, i'll try to post my entry set up, here is one, sell open on 15m chart. comment please

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Below 25?????? I think is 75

--- 帖子 #7 ---
hello Tenno, Can you explain ur moneymanagement as well please ? and wat Sl do u use ?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
thanks Tragapips, yes i missed type 25, it is 75. I forgot to mention in mt 3.83 i use 25 to 75 scale. on mt4 the scale is 20 to 80, it is the same, above 20 is overbought and below 80 is oversold. On High Price i wait for the closest price from the recent high, then watch for the candlestick and william percentage range on 5m to down direction (white body) first on 15m time frame and open sell order, i place my stop loss 5 pips above high. I always set my profit to 10 to 20 pips per trade it is same on buy order i wait till the price break today's low then i set my buy order The Thing is : you have to practice william indicator on three time frame at a time, determine the best time to buy or sell ( i have trouble explain it on words...but i'll keep trying to post ) learn how sterling price action up and down, use william to look for price retracement or rebound for my money management i always use : 0.5 lot on my first trade on high or low then if it tries again to break low or high at 10 pips from my first trade i average it to 1 lot and exit on target profit 15 pips from my second order, i never enter more than 1.5 lot on a single trade exit as early as possible and wait for another william indicator signal for buy or sell through out the day it is a rather hard to explain system but it works for me... any question would be great.....

Jog, Could you post a 5 minute chart of a good gbp/usd trade that you have? thanks, hm

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Jog, is it that Sidus system shud be in UP mode as well as Williams of 1hour shud be heading up, to take buy trades on 5/15min charts ?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
could you post the 3 timeframe charts with an explanation of entry and exit, please?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Looks like a nice system...keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #13 ---
hey jogjatrader can u post your indicator here . thanks

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Sorry guys, have been busy since may last post i am working on screenshots of my strategy : I use basic indicator 1H sidus method is for temporary trend, do look up william indicator on 5m if william on 15m looks downward then sell it is, take your profit if william 5m below 75 or 80 line. Sometimes it generate false signal but most of it profitable. The fun is : if you happens to sell near high (only after the candlestick pointing downward and sidus indicating downtrend) it could be the high of the day try do sell and place your stop 5 t0 10 pips above high you can ride the profit rollercoaster to low of the day, watch it and learn and repeat it everyday. Do the same on highest price of the day If you do your practice properly you are richhhhh..... after you master the trick dont forget to learn my way of money management and risk management on my next post happy trading

--- 帖子 #15 ---
As tenno eh jogjatrader said, he just uses William's Percent Range (%R) indicator in his system. You can find this indi in MetaTrader platform.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
The William's Percent Range of M5, M15 and H1 charts are all heading up. Most of the time, you will get better entries using M5 chart provided that the other two charts have the same direction.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
anyone, what does he use the MA's for?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Great man.... thanks a lot BillGates ....for posting those screenshots i think we are in the same path....to become rich constantly..... as for watchout4me, i use MA mostly on M15 time frames just to filter whether is trending or not....if not the MA should be crossing around as for sidus method if the price trending down you should wait untill the price reach the highest of the day then sell your way to the lowest price of the day..... this system is greaaaaaaaaat i mean greaaaaaat for scalping the pound you should be able to catch 20 pips or more a day just watching the william cruising around, if not you should consult your doctor, are you sick ?????? come on guys try it and tell me how ur doing??

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi jogjatrader did you already using this system in your live account ? and how long did you trade using tenno system and how bout the result maximal drowndown and consecutive losses ?.... and btw thanks for sharing your system

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Well...to speak the truth i have using this quite a while on live acc i manage to take 20 pips daily its been 6 month now and still testing it on demo acc, looking for weakness and anomalies...so far the result are tremendously as for maximum drawdown, consecutive losses i dont use one...mainly because i use my risk management so tight, coz my target is only 20 pips, as soon as i reach the target i stopped trading and live on my life as usual experience is the key to my so simple system..... nowadays i have been thinking to use the strategy and start to trade with other people money, cos in my country 20 dolar daily is very a good number and you can buy lots of things if anyone have question feel free to email me at Email removed __________________ Have some pips....

Jogjatrader, I just used your system for trading the 5 minute chart for the gbp/usd and I scored 19 pips. I should have not only gotten 19 pips, but should have gotten an additional 9 pips, but at this moment, and for the rest of this week, I will just test the system on my live account. Forget a dummy account, because the only way to truly learn is to put my whole self into trading which includes all of my emotions. Anyway, I should have had 28 pips today(european trading), but my total goal, daily, is to get 10 pips every single day. Doing this will allow me to double my account twice per month. I plan on getting very wealthy within 6 months and buying me a new car(BMW or Mercedes... ). At this moment, I'm riding a bicycle, but with this new system that you have taught, I feel that I can increase my $100 account. I want to get to the point of buying and selling 20,000 mini lots for 10 pips profit each time I trade. As I get more experience with your system my self confidence will also increase. But, until then, I'll go for 10 pips daily. By the way, when I say 10 pips, I'm talking about 14 pips total minus the 4 pip spread for the gbp/usd. I am using FXCM .com as my broker and they charge 4 pips spread for trading the gbp/usd. Result of today's trading: I bought gbp/usd at 2.0271 on a true hammer formation that was in the oversold(above 80% on the William %) area and got out when the market closed above the 21 ema line at 2.0294 which is a 19 pip profit for the day for me.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I hope jogjatrader isn't gone. This looks like a very good system, although there is quite a bit of it that isn't clear.

i'm still here well currencytrader ....congratulations...wellcome to my rich club today i just made soooooo many pips....50 pips maybe, i dont count There are still weakness about my system ......but as long as u trade on asian and european market and limit your profit to 10 t0 20 pips a day you are rich my friend (increase the lot not he pips) stays 20 pips daily at least 3 month after that (you can choose whether to buy a car or a house) ...trust me i have tested it sooooo many times give some money to poor people then god will be with you after all its only money..... do i still need to post screenshots of my system....dont think so...its all there in mt 3.83 platform.....search for yourself....its sooo easy Speak the truth ..... there are still more to tell about my system, my experiences is to be specific, but hey if you happy with the basic setup than enjoy it..... ______________________ Increase the lot not the pips...... enjoy your journey to happyness

I have some questions- 1. You mentioned using the Sidus setup on the 1H chart. Then you said it's all a matter of following the %Rs on each time frame. Where does Sidus fit in? 2. Is your entry trigger the 5M or the 15M chart? 3. Do you wait to enter until the %R has left the overbought or oversold area?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
first question : answer : i use sidus to determine daily trend, if 18 EMA (orange) crosses 28 EMA (red) i know that trend is changing if price is on trending downward the best way is to find highest price of the day to sell. same thing on trending up ward i dont use 1H chart as my trigger mainly just for price direction second question : answer : yes i use trigger first look at william 5m than watch closely on 15m if its the same direction than you are save to entry third question : answer : i enter immediately enter buy after the william pointing up on oversold area and enter sell after william pointing down on overbought area ( first look at 5m than look for confirmation on 15m chart) but of course it wouldnt be that easy, watch and learn, determine your entry point based on your experiences, it may generate false signal but as you triy it over and over again you will understand how it works. important fact : always look 5m 15m and H1 chart together three of them at the same time, tile the chart vertically please tell me where u from i always happy to make friends to traders from around the world _______________________________ be patient.....wait for the set up..... enjoy...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I'm from Texas- USA If the 1H MAs show a downtrend- do you take only short trades? Thanks

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Jogjatrader, Remember, in my last post, how I told you that my goal was 10 pips per day? Well, I just scored another 14 pips again during the european session and am finished for the day. Here's what happened: Even at the beginning of the european session the market was oversold big time; well below the 20% William range. I waited for a reversal signal in the oversold area(which should always be below 20% anyway). Well, I recognized the "morning star reversal signal" which occured below the 20% William range and just waited for a small pullback. This reversal signal occured at 1:45am and 1:55am Eastern time or 7:45am and 7:55am London time. I waited for a small pullback and got into the market. The market kept going down and went 19 pips against me, but I refused to get out of the market because the "morning star reversal" occured below the 20% William Range. So, it was all about faith and knowing that I made the correct move. And, true to your word Jogjatrader, the market fullfilled it's destiny, by going up and gave me my 10 pips plus an additional 4 pips on the top. As I type this, the markert still has room to go up, but I'm already out of the market. I finished up at exactly 2:10am Eastern time(or 8:10am London time). My whole working day was 2 hours and 10 minutes. And, if you ask me, this is the ultimate business to be in. In 6 months, my income can be greater than 90% of all american doctors, but yet spend less than 4 hours a day creating an income based on taking money away from the 'dumb money' market.... : Once again, Jogjatrader, thanks the help. I'll use this system until the day I die. Naw, I take that back, I'll move to Hawaii and trade from 7pm to a maximum of 12am midnight, and go to bed and still be able to wake up by 7am like normal folks, but without the job worries...hehehe peace, Currency Trader

One of the key to my system is sidus method on 1H chart, if it says down then down it is, i am not say that i should only open short trade, but long as well depends on what william says on 5m and 15m. best time to buy : nearest low price of the day allow 4 - 5 pips above low best time to sell : nearest high price of the day allow 4 - 5 pips below high always look for trend signal by sidus method on 1H For currencytrader All you have to do is watch the trend on 1H follow it thru...get experience sterling is trending down look for resistance then hold sell.... my system do not work in any news release....stay away from news.... dont risk your emotion, we trade forex for days to come not just for a minute or two feel free to email me _____________ Happy trading

--- 帖子 #35 ---
sorry billbss, english is not my native language so i have problem explaining my system to you, but i'll try again, here i go : If sidus H1 is signaling down trend, that means the price action today is also trending down, the best position is to sell on highest possible price or near psychological price, but after the price reach the low of the day the price began to oscillating upward, so is william on 5m, if this is the case then you should open buy position....again it depends on how william behave. william on 5m chart act like little wave and could start a bigger wave which means big price movement, thats all it is.... correct my english if i'm wrong ___________________ Good luck testing my system

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I'm sorry but I don't get it. I'll just have to go back and look at some charts until I do. You say that it's very important to establish the 1H trend. Then you say that if the 1H trend is down you can go both long and short. I presume that if you establish that the 1H trend is up- you can still go both long and short.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yes thats right billbss i will go short or long based on william %R 5m and 15m and the best trading time is asian and european time sidus is only for temporary trend direction like today in GBPUSD the spike is has been predicted by william on 5m, just buy blindly on 5m set up stop 20 pips below your price and enjoy your surf to the highest price of the day _______________ Gone surfing.....the pips

Jogjatrader, Jogja, It seems apparent now that this system of yours doesn't have any losses! My trading account was at $69 and I was desperate to find a way to get this market working for me. Since discovering you, Jogjatrader, my account has shot up from $69 two days ago, to a little bit over $110 now!! I made 13 pips today. I saw that the market was below the 20% william range and that a reversal top was forming at the 2.0325 - 2.0322 area for the gbp/usd, so I sold market at 2.0323 and got out at on an exit at 2.0306 level for 13 pip profit(including the 4 pip spread for the gbp/usd). So, the 13 pips was my total profit after the 4 pip spread. So, whenever I say that I made 14 pips or 12 pips, I mean to say that this is the total "profit" I've made from the actual trade(which doesn't include the 4 pip spread). Mind you, this trade occured a DAY BEFORE "Non-Farm Payroll" news which comes out at 7:30am Central Time here in the state of Missouri. Friday morning, I will not trade. I will just watch to take note to see if the actual trade develops before the Non Farm Payroll news. If the trade does occur, I will just stay out of the market, and make a mental note that even on the day of Non-Farm Payroll, a trade setup is still possible. Thanks for your help jogjatrader. peace, CurrencyTrader

hi currencytrader can u please post your chart when you BUY / SELL .. thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
bapho, I don't know how to take a picture of my chart or how to post it. I'm just hear learning a simple trick to get my account in the right direction. But, if you look back, I think I saw where somebody posted a 5 minute, 15 minute, and 1 hr chart a day or so ago. That'll give you a good example as to what to look for in order to trade the market. ct..

This system has losses. I'm going to show you one. The Down Arrow on the chart I'm posting is the only retest of a high that qualifies under his rules. Its the only one that meets the description you gave of your trade. It would have been in profit only 6 pips before turning up and being stopped out. It got stopped out where the X is marked. It would have been a loser under any of the rule variations he has posted. The high marked with the X couldn't have been traded short because it exceeded the daily high by more than 4 or 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
As I write this there is another probable loser in the works. There have been three qualified entries today. 1 winner 1 loser 1 probable loser

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I think i have to clarify this to you Billbss If currencytrader stated that he has no losses, he is right...100% only 10 to 20 pips daily for Billbss, my system has weakness, but not in your case...there was something you didnt notice, you only posted and look at one time frame, you should look at three time frame at the same time, and your entry was too early, and your stop was too close, look at william 5m and wait for confirmation on 15m. It takes practices, the price are random, but there are patterns, look for it combine it and repeat Look for GBPUSD price behavior, especially on top and bottom prices I have my own risk management, please provide me your email i will write it down to you....my email {email removed} for currencytrader thank you soo much, for using my system as your experience grow in forex trading i will teach you one more part of my system....and you will have no financial problem ever again in your life... _______________ keep trying my friend...... i'll see you when you get there....rich side

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I did take into consideration the other time frames. The trade could not have been confirmed until after 5:50 GMT on the 15M chart. I'll stand by what I said. The stop placement would have been irrelevant to Currencytrader's post. He posted at 3:02 AM EDT. That's 0702 GMT. The low between any possible trade time and 0702 would have given 6 pips max profit.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
thats why i ask CT to show his Trade chart here ... i wanna know if it's true or not

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I don't doubt that he did what he said he did. i don't mean that at all. I just don't think he did it following the rules of this system, as they are posted.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hey jogjatrader, Thanks for the system. What do you average monthly in pips since starting this system? Please send your risk management to [{email removed} Thanx JS

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Finally, ForexFactory approved my user id to post replys. I wanted to reply yesterday so bad when I profited trade after trade. Jogjatrader, you have really given me some hope. I have been practing and learning forex for a year and a half. When I saw your system I educated myself with the indicators and sidus method. Yesterday I demo traded your sytem and I profited 52 pips with four trades. My goal is to only generate 10 - 20 pips daily. I just traded every opportunity for more experience. I also used this system this past Tuesday for the first time and I profited 10 pips (take profit) and I'm having a great time. CurrencyTrader you opened my eyes in another thread and this thread which was found a system that fits your personality and this might be it I will continue to practice and gain more experience. Thank you Jogjatrader I'm leaving work now and I will trade the asian time tonight. I will continue to post my status with The Tenno System. God Bless and many thanks.

Hey guys, Hope your trading is working out for you guys. I have two things to say: 1) I'm not on this board to prove myself or argue with peope. Both are just a waste of time. 2) Lastly, my account is growing slowly because of jogja. God is in the smallest of details and there's probably a small detail that you guys are leaving out. If you're sticking to the rules as stringent as you're doing, and not giving enough room for the market to move against you, then it's apparent that there's going to be a loss. The chart that billbss posted was a good chart, where profits could have been made. On that second high spike, on his chart, anyone could have made profits on that trade. And, even if you would have gotten in on the first arrow, for a sell, if you would have stuck to the trade, you could have still gotten profits. Let's just say this, for the last 11 possible trades, according to my own rules, mixed with the technical analysis that jogjatrader has taught me, 8 trades, out of 11 trades would have yielded 20 full profitable pips(24 pips total), 2 trades would have yielded me 10 full pips before a small retracement back to the original sell/buy entry, and one trade was questionable, but still yielded 20 full profitable pips if I would have had more experience in recognizing what was presented to me. Now, I don't have time or patience to take pictures of charts and post them on this board. So, if any of you clowns want to be negative in your assessment of this technique, then go somewhere else and be negative, or better yet, create your own system so that someone else can criticize and put down every negative connotation that seems to be wrong with the system. Remember, each individual who trades the market comes into each unknown technical analysis with different views of the market. I came in with a certain view and what Jogjatrader technique did for me was fullfill a certain view that was needed to be filled in order to simplify what I already knew. His trick and attention to details made my understanding that much better. In any case, I have no losses and to me that's all that matters for my account. Everything else is bullsh*t.... peace baby, hilton

Jogjatrader, Well, give me a couple more weeks of practice, since I'm a fast learner, and I'll email you so that you can show me the other aspect of your trading system so that I can increase my ability to never have another problem with trading the market ever again, thus no more money worries... peace, CT

--- 帖子 #51 ---
well, i do miss one more rule of my system, i hope this clarify things : The facts : william is an oscillator indicator, his job is oscillating around, sometime right (profit) sometime wrong (loss), but the best thing of william is : it can predict a big move early than any indicator i know. it's acting like an ocean wave, the little wave couldnt give you anything but if you ignore it you never know when the bigger wave will begin. as an experienced surfer knows when the big wave will hit him, he knows by experimenting and trying over and over again later he knows that every little wave has patterns, there are no similar wave form but the patterns are the same.....trust me Basic rule : The 20 and 80 is the barrier of william, if you happen to sell in oversold position (william 5m) then whatever the wave give you after the line is in overbought position you have to take it, in case of billbss you should take the profit (the wave has failed to form bigger wave), wait again for the wave to reform. thats why i keep shouting to everyone that practice is very important to my system. its all there waiting for you to discover apply the same rule to buy position Sidus method is really helping me if the 28 EMA (lower) and 18 EMA (uppper) not crossed the price will continue trending up i wish to write everything but my english are limited......i am very sorry Today the trend is still upward, caution to sell position never let it too long well guys i am very happy to all your post in this thread keep posting Thank you for emailing me, i will post my screenshot, but lately i am very busy teaching my system here offline at my office. but i will post my screenshot by the way i live in Yogyakarta, Indonesia (south east asia) _________________ best regards Teno

Hi Jogjatrader After I got home from work I started looking for a signal using The Tenno System and I have reached 7+ Pips (after spread). This is great and i can continue to seek the next signal before the big news release today, but I'm so sleepy. Thank you I will continue to practice and provide my results. Please keep up the good work. God Bless and Happy Trading!!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
keep it up man. Stay patient and look for those signals that ONLY occur in the oversold and overbought area... peace, CT

Jogjatrader, The total spread of the market was only 21 pips or so between the opening of the market and by the time I finished trading, so that's not a whole lot of room to trade, YET AND STILL I MADE 20 PIPS TODAY !! Well, I just had to trade today. And, to prove to myself that I could do it, I did exact that..traded even on NON-FARM Payroll Day!! As everyone knows, every time I have profited, I have put the exact numbers or time that I traded in my posts so that people can go back and see that it was true on there own charts. So, I'll do exactly that again. I leave the hard 'looking' work up to those that wants to look on there own charts. Anyways, Jogjatrader, here's what I did... At 12:50am(central standard time for me), there was a overbought above the 80% william(mind you if there's a situation where I see the market overbought at 79%, I still won't go for the trade!!). The market made a reversal signal at that exact time, and I just waited for a retracement back up to about the 2.0362 level. I sold market at 2.0362 level and just waited for the market to give me my 10 pips, which it always does! Well, almost 3 hours later, at 4:05 central time, the market went right past the the 2.0348 level, by a few pips, and gave me my 10 pips that I was looking for. I could have only gotten 3 pips profit had I followed my own rules, but history has already told me that the market will move at least 10 pips total profit and that is what I based my decision on. So, my first trade was 10 pips total profit, which does not include the 4 pip spread. My second trade was just as nice. Here's what happened: I saw that at the conclusion of the 3:05am(central time) candle, the william % range was well below 20% for the oversold level. The next candle was an engulfing candle which is a buy signal! So, what I did was I waited for a retracement around the 2.0351 level, which the market hit that exactly, and went ahead and bought market at 2.0351 and let it rip baby! The market went up and tapped 2.0365 level for another 10 beautiful whole pips profit. So, even with a 21 pip spread between the opening and the time that I stopped trading, I still made 20 pips profit for the day. I really only want 10 pips per day, but when you start seeing all these pips on the table, and know what it's about to do, it's almost a fools joke to not do anything about it, even if you just want to skim the damn market and get 3 to 5 pips. Just remember, 5 pips per day, which is simple to get, 5 days a week(even the day of non-farm payroll) can double your account once per month, give you the freedom you want, and at the same time, if you have $100 in your account, you can take that and turn it into about $409,000 in a single year. That's if you don't take anything out and remain discipline.... Now, that I know better, I will do better. peace, CT

congratulations again CT you have disciplined yourself to get rich slowly, remember!! always be flexible, look for opportunity. You havent ride the big wave yet, someday you will, i have repeatedly earn 25 to 33 pips both on european and american market, the secret is you have to combine your trades at same direction to sidus method on 1H chart, meaning try to hold trades that have the same direction to the trend on uptrend at the lowest price possible near the low on asian market, open buy position try to hold it untill european market open or even for the rest of the day, instead of taking profit you can set sell stop at your buy price yes exaclty the same price (doing this you just secure your buy position, coz if the market turn back it will hedge your buy position, if your broker allow you to close hedge position in single click you are save, cos when buy position closed by sell position at the same price you get 0.00 pips that means no trade) do the opposite on downtrend well, if you just secure your position you can watch your profit growing as the trend find its way.....usually profit 45 to 50 pips on single day try this on your demo acc first, if you understand the cyle than off you go my friend, but be careful just one trade at a time......if you succeed you just evolve from scalper to day trader i just scored 12 pips in less than 5 minute on first retracement after nonfarm payroll news from sell 2.0388 TP at 2.0376 __________________________________________ never take more than you need....... market will love you

From the above quote: "Now, I don't have time or patience to take pictures of charts and post them on this board." Of course you're not going to post any charts. I know exactly why you don't and it has nothing to do with time. If there are any new traders reading this thread- Don't believe for a minute that any system has no losses. Anytime you see a claim like that, it's a huge red flag and you're probably better off just moving on. If you are interested in this system despite that, go through the thread. Try to gather up the rules (it's tough with this one) and write them down . Go through some charts and apply the rules as they are given . Make you own mind up if it loses or not. Don't believe what anybody says, including me. Particularly don't pay any attention to someone who claims no losers but doesn't have "time" to post charts. Then you need to watch it in real time. This system is prone to having a chart pattern look like a winner, when it really wasn't. If a long candle forced the indicators out of the OB/OS zone, keep in mind you may have been entering near the end of that candle. Don't put a penny of real money on this thing until you've checked it thoroughly.

Ok, I am currently trying to combine all the whole thread into one document, as that is how I learn. Luckily the thread is only 2 pages right now. But I do have a few questions for clarification, so let me setup the situation. 1st look at 1 hr and detirmine trend, for this discussion lets use the buy situation. then look at 5m to detirmine if it is oversold, which is shown by the williams being below the 75 (80). If oversold check 15 min, if not confirmed, which is defined as williams 15m showing up below the 75, then wait until it does show up below 75. Questions 1)in some posts you refer to the williams going in a downward direction instead of being in an oversold or below -75 setup. Are these different concepts? or do you mean going downward while below -75 or going in a downward direction while between -25 and -75? 2) How long do you wait for the 15 to confirm the 5 min williams? As an example look exactly 2 hours prior to this post on your charts, (I use this description because of different borker times and your locals) I see upward trend on 1 hr, I see oversold on 5 min williams, but don't see confirmation on the 15 min. it is now 2 hours later, and no confirmation. Do I wait or just say that was not a complete signal? So really how long would you wait for the 15min williams confirmation? I think I have more questions but will post them after getting answers to these. thanks (also, I have seen many people come and go saying their system cannot lose. I think that statement is a function of experience, or lack of. Even this systems creator says it has flaws. My best results so far were the first 2 months of trading a demo account and just making a trade whenever I felt like it with no knowledge or understanding, increased account 40% IN 2 MONTHS! It seemed like I couldnt loose, at least until the market changed...........

Bill, Once again, is there any real reason why I should take the time to learn how to post pics to this board with the attitude that you have. What you say makes sense to alot of people; even common sense for that matter. While it makes sense to alot of people, I make the real "cents"...hehe But, common sense is not so common... This is my last post to you unless you buckle up and get serious... ct

Bapho, Looking back, I should have stayed out of the market, even though I made those 20 pips. Looking back, after Non-Farm Payroll, only makes me see that the market will always be flat the day of non-farm payroll until news comes out. You can trade a choppy market; especially with the gbp/usd(I wouldn't advise trying to do that with the eur/usd because it's not volatile enough before non-farm payroll), but I would highly advise to just stay out of the market on the day of non-farm payroll. It's o.k to trade it the day before, but not the day of non-farm. From now on, I'll use that day for rest and not for trading. ct

Jogjatrader, I only trade the european session. Like I said before getting 10 pips daily is my goal for sure. I need to learn how to hold my position longer for bigger pips like you're getting. I still need to learn(a new technique) the Sidus Method on the 1hr chart; because right now, what I'm doing is I'm combining my person experience with your 80% and 20% William Range rule and I'm getting great results. What I haven't done is learn the 1hr Sidus Method yet. So, I have to learn that so that I can get more pips out of my trades. Other than that, I will just keep doing what I'm doing. One thing about it, the market may change, but there is one thing that never changes, since the beginning of time; and that is turning points. There are certain patterns that WILL NEVER CHANGE; and hasn't changed since Japanese traders started trading Rice to become wealthy. With the pattern I use, it works 3 times, or maybe 4 times, every week. There's one or two days during the week where it doesn't work because there's no signal. But, such is life. I concentrate on one pattern only and I wound up loving it to death... ct

Jogjatrader, When I was in college, which was only a few years ago, I was roommates with a good guy from Indonesia. I even dated a beautiful indonesian girl that he set me up with man. I mean she was absolutely gorgeous. I asked him if she would date a black man from New Orleans, Louisiana(which is where I'm from). He told me that she loved dark skin.. Man, he had me laughing my ass off... I dated her for 2 years. She came back with me to New Orleans and I showed her the "hood". Everybody back home loved her to death. Even the girls, back home, who didn't like me, liked her... Anyway, to make a long story short, she went back to Indonesia for Medical school and her and I haven't spoken to each other in 2 years. My ex-roommate and I keep in contact because we still play basketball a few times per month. So, I find it cool that you're from Indonesia... Happy trading, ct

Hello, Well I managed to get another +15 pips today. I have been studying Japenese Candles on babypips.com and just practing every signal I see. I really like this system and I will continue to read and learn and get better with time. Thanks guys!!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Awesome, Good going! It's about 11:07pm Central Time and I'm just checking the board to see what's going on. I like to do alot of my shopping on the weekends on the internet. I just came back from www.omahasteaks.com . I ordered some steaks and burgers and they'll ship them to me, still frozen, overnight. It's a little costly, but I like there products. I will be moving to Hawaii, on the island of Oahu, by the end of next month(september), so I won't have to order any kind of seafood since it's fresh in Hawaii. Well, anyway, good going today. happy trading, ct

when you enter long or short, what time frame did you see? and CST = -8GMT?

I use only 5 minute chart. I know that jogjatrader says to use a 3 major timeframes, from 5m, 15m, and 1hr. But, once again, I am coming in from a different set of experiences. I'm using what is known to work for Jogjatrader and combining it with what I know has worked in the past for myself. peace, CT

--- 帖子 #67 ---
sorry still trying to wrap my head around this one.... Did you use the 5 min only for a signal? or can you tell me exactly when you got the signal? for some reason I am just not seeing the signals as I understand the system.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
thanks for pointing that out, it helps to know that I am a little closer to understanding the rules. Do you look for the slope of the williams or just whether or not it is above/below the 20/80?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
don't make it harder than it is... either the mkt is above 80% or below 20% at the time of a sell or buy signal. observe what works every day.. ct

over thinking things has always been my problem, didnt work well in college either(at least on tests)....

Hi mcmep, I use all three charts to determine a signal. Honestly I just follow the first post in the thread and like currencytrader says make sure The William is oversold or overbrought. I have been studying Japenese candles and the Sidus Method and I'm just trying to be a great and wise trader. I find this to be a very simple system and I pray I continue to improve using The Tenno System. Happy Trading P.S. If you have to read all the important post in this thread over and over I reccomend you do so, I know I do everyday and at this time. There's hints on being wiser trading this system better. Like currencytrader was saying in one post he was in trade that was against him and he saw a candle that confirmed reversal and won that trade. After that I had to learn about candles and that's what I have been doing all yesterday and so far today. I also like the Bollinger Bands that Jogjatrader noted you can use as accessories. God Bless!!

Currencytrader, Steaks sounds really good. I live in Florida and putting some steaks on grill sounds yummy! Moving to Hawaii sounds very exciting, I can imagine being on the Mokulua Island with my laptop trading and relaxing. (I saw Mokulua Island, Oahu, Hawaii on the discovery channel). Are you moving there just to move, if so that's awesome to just get up and move to hawaii? Well enjoy the weekend and your steaks!! God Bless

Mc, I'm like you, I used to overthink also, while in college because I figured that the more I thought, the greater my grades would be. That transferred over to trading! I was thinking that the more I thought about the details, every little spec of dust that moved the market, the more profitable I would be. But, I can promise you, that the only thing that counts is finding something that has worked for centuries, don't question that something, and keeping that something simple. If you can do that, you'll never have a loosing trade. Let me back that statement up real quick. When I first got started with the currency market, I read a book called "Market Wizards". There was one trader, and I can't think of his name now because I read that book years ago, that had something like a 99.6% winning rate. The only time this guy lost was when he had to leave his computer due to an emergency, or when he had to leave his computer due to something that came up urgently! Out of the thousands of trades he has traded(day trading), he lost something like 3 times and the losses were so small until they don't even register on the radar. Anyway, the first rule to investment is not to loose, and the second rule is the follow the first rule happy trading, ct

I'll be staying on Oahu and living within Honolulu... The reason why I'm moving is because even though I love trading, I hate the hours I have to trade. I trade from 12am-5am(central standard time). When I move to hawaii, I'll be trading from 7pm-12am, which is a huge difference because I can still go to bed before midnight(hawaii time) and get six or seven hours of sleep, and still do everything I want to do during the day, including shopping online, going to the beach, and being back home before 5pm to cook me so "close to home" fresh seafood(gotta love those crustaceans..hehe). I love to cook. I get all of my cooking ingredients from online along with pictures and simple instructions. It's amazing what the internet has done for the lifestyle of those who are willing to change and take advantage of change itself... ct ct

Hey guys/gals, I want to give those who don't have these specific sources some good information to study when it comes to learning how to trade with candlesticks. Remember, to use these candlestick signals ONLY when the market is either above 80% or below 20%. Each person will perceive this information differently, but these candlestick formations have been proven to have been effective; even before Japanese Rice traders were even involved with trading at all. Happy studying... 1) http://www.candlecharts.com/pdfs/article1.pdf 2) http://www.streetauthority.com/terms...ng-candles.asp peace, CT

Awesome, Well, it's about 4:57am in the morning to be exact. Just doing some research on Hawaii Anyway, I think if you bought that book, called Market Wizards, from Amazon.com you'd see the guy that I was talking about that had the 99.6% winning rate. The book is called Market Wizards: Interviews with top trader by Jack D. Schwager Here's a link to the book at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Market-Wizards...6308010&amp;sr=8-1 happy readings, CT

Thanks CurrencyTrader, I just ordered this book about 10 mins ago, thanks for the link. I have a question regarding an online broker. I have funded CMS Forex Broker. Do you have any good experience with any brokers? I ask because if CMS gives me any problems I will look into another broker. i would have asked last week, but I already sent money to fund my account. I will start trading live tonight around 10 p.m. eastern time (Asian Time). Thank you for all your help and Happy Trading and God Bless!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Awesome, I use www.fxcm.com as my broker. They may or may not be the best. But one thing is for certain; they are the biggest non-interbank currency broker in the world! That either says alot for them or alot about there ability to market themselves. In any case, there execution is excellent and you don't have to go through them with your trades. All trades quotes comes straight from the banks which means lower spread rates. I chose them because of there reputation. I'm pretty sure that there's other good brokers out there. But, since you already have a broker at hand, you can always use FXCM as your second hand man if your needs become greater or you feel unsatisfied with your broker. I've been with them for 4 years now and have never felt uncomfortable and never had one complaint. If there was a technical problem the problem got fixed really fast, which is just the nature of computers.... peace, ct

--- 帖子 #80 ---
hi guys, have been following this thread with interest,thanks everybody and a big thanks to jogjatrader for sharing,you must have a big heart brother,anyways OANDA is worth having a look at for a broker,I used to use FXCM,but for me personally I much prefer OANDA as they deal in micro-lots which means you can start with a lot smaller bank roll,sleep at night,only lose small amounts,until you win consistently and then follow your dream like currency trader. Also if you want multiple lots on different pairs you can do so with out running out of margin hope that helps happy scalping cheers Dave

Man...the market went flying up from the beginning of the london open and the william % was well below 20%. I was just looking for an entry to get into either on the continuation to the upside or the drop. Luckily, the market hit one of the major pivot point resistence as the william was dropping below 20%! I knew the market would either have to go down or there would have to be a candle continuity signal. The market dropped and at 2:50am or so, I saw a "hangman" candle form, which told me that if the next candle closed as a 'down' candle, I best should sell the market. Well, the next candle was a down candle at the end of the 2:55am close and I sold market at 2.0440 and exited at 2.0426 for my 10 pips for the day. It took me a whopping 10 minutes to get what I wanted but it came swiftly. Then, the market retraced back up to the 21ema line and I knew that it would retest the bottom again and it did just that. I wasn't in on that one, but at least my total working hours was from midnight until 3:05am central standard time(or 4:05 Eastern time). Not a bad night..... peace, CT

--- 帖子 #82 ---
You guys just witness the weakness of my system, In the morning (asian times) william as usual gave signal very good couple of 10 pips untill its reach high over 2.0466 and the highest possible sell price is 2.0459 ever since the william just dropped sooo deep untill 2.0286 it gave pure signal up on 5m i was able to buy at 2.0297 and have profit up to 2.0325 nice one. my point is when it comes to trending my system dont work until the market went very oversold or overbought, so i noticed too there are GBP news at 3.30 pm my time (indonesian times) in this situation my system didnt give you anything other than false signal as i conclude : 1.My system is very good every day 10 to 20 pips is guarantee (only if you have master it) even more....pips 2. Beware of news release , Just dont forget to look if there are any news release nearby time on GBPUSD pair or news marked red on forexfactory calendar, if you knew there are news nearby and if the impact of the news move against william just stay out Trader another day!!! 3. As CT note combine my system with other tools you will get better result _______________________________________ Remember....there are no perfect system but there are a perfect trader.......experienced one

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Currency Trader, I was there too during that time and scored +11 PIPS. That was my third trade this morning. I had a total of +20 PIPS today! I love this system and using other tool's really help especially recognizing candlesticks (Awesome). I also traded live and added $20.00 to the $124.64 (now $144.64) deposited in my broker account. I will trade again tonight once I get off of work. God Bless and Happy Trading!!!!!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Jog, You're absolutely correct that other tools, simple ones that is, is absolutely necessary to get great results. I use your William % idea and combine that with pivot points for the london session, along with candlestick formation recognition in order to not have a loosing day. Also, you're correct when you say that there's no perfect trading system and that 10 pips a day is guaranteed; but there is a perfect trader The best traders in the world are the most disciplined traders in the world... By the way, I emailed you at your email address on your forexfactory account. Did you get my email? Happy trading, CT

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Awesome, I found out that if you use pivot points, located at http://www.forexinterbank.com/pivot-...calculator.php , use candlestick formation for turning point recognition, along with the the william, you'll get your 10 pips daily, I can promise you that. Matter of fact, let me let you in on something. The 3 most effective candlestick formations that works for the best turning points for the gbp/usd are as follow: 1) Hammer at top of an uptrend or downtrend and combined with the william oversold or overbought... 2) morning star reversal candlestick formation at the top of trend or bottom of trend with the william oversold or overbought.. 3) hangman candlestick formation is tricky because like today, it didn't fall in the oversold or overbought area which is common for this formation. You'll just have to observe it in action and let the market teach you how to trade the hangman candlestick formation. Now, I'll let you do your own research in the top 3 formation and I will let you see, on your own, how they form in the real world of trader, in real time, on your own real chart from your broker. That's the best way to learn. All you have to do is type in the candlestick formation I just wrote, above, in Google.com and you'll be up and running with good info in no time flat. By the way, whatever you do , don't get a big head from doing correct trades. What you did last night doesn't count. Keep that mentality in your head and respect the market enough to be scared of having smart money take away your money from your pocket. Like I said, the first rule to trading is not to loose, and the second rule is to follow the first one... Good trading, CT

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Guys/gals, When you do your pivot point calculations from the above link I gave, make sure to click on the 12am EST time for your pivot point for the gbp/usd. When I use it, I make sure that I use it in combination with both the william and the candlestick formations. Now, get to crackin on that research and I expect 10 pips daily... CT

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hello CurrencyTrader, First, let me thank you for all your help. I'm truly thankful for you. I looked at the pivot point calculator and I will study it for I don't have a clue what it really is, but I'm a fast learner and will put it into my trading. I want you to know that I have heard and accepted this statement: (By the way, whatever you do , don't get a big head from doing correct trades. What you did last night doesn't count. Keep that mentality in your head and respect the market enough to be scared of having smart money take away your money from your pocket.) I want you to know that I believe in warning comes before destruction and I will only go for 10 PIPS per day and 1 trade per day! I did this tonight and have profited my 10 pips for today in less than 15 mins with the 12:30 a.m candle for my live account. I will now just practice with my demo account for the remainder of the Euro Session and practice with adding pivot points tool. CurrencyTrader I have read and believe that no question is a stupid question. Can you guide me with the pivot point calculator? I selected GPD/USD for currency, Daily for Type, 12AM NYT for Switch Point, and todays date and clicked Calculate. Which numbers are important ( I see R2, MP4, R1, MP3, PP, MP2, S1, MP1, and S2).. Thank you I appreciate your help. I am studying and trying to understand as I type this post. God Bless and Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Awesome, All the numbers are good points where the market has a possibility of reacting to. That's where you have to learn how to use candlestick formation and the william %. For example, if the market goes up to PP or R1 and the william is overbought above 80% and you see a hammer form, you best be thinking about selling the market... Now, it's time to get back to my own trading at this moment.. ct

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I don't want anyone here getting confused because of what I throw at them. Whatever you were doing, beforehand, that was working, keep doing it. You can always work on the pivot trades later on. Just keep it simple... ct

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks CurrencyTrader, Now that I have read and saw examples I understand Pivot Points much clearer than I did 1 hour ago LOL, Thanks for your example. Thank you so much for letting me know I'm just growing as a Trader. I feel so good right now because I now understand things compared to a year ago where I didn't know where to start in the Forex world. I have to tell you that people like you and Jogjatrader are so appreciated for helping a Novice Trader like myself. May we become more and more wiser. I will talk with you later and man I really like this system (Tenno) Way to go Jogjatrader!!!!

It sold more that 20 PIPS and all three charts were overbought and heading down and so is The Sidus Method on the 1 hour chart. The 15m Chart showed a Bearish Engulfing Candlestick pattern (Common pattern after strong up-trends. Signifies that buyers are losing contol) confirming possible sell and the rest is history. I Demo traded this trade and just becoming more familiar with this system, I already profited +10 PIPS today with my Live Account when the GBP gained value around 12:30 a.m. I just edited this post to let everyone know that I'm in the Eastern Time Zone!!!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I didn't see anything I like so far, so I will let the mkt continue down and then if there's a good buy signal, I'll go ahead and buy mkt. If not, then, I'll just stay out of the mkt and let my account rest for the day... Talk to you tomarrow.. ct

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I told you that I would let the market fall, in my post to Awesome, and I did just that. at about 3:10am my time(central time) the market created a hammer at 2.0257 level and I bought market and exited at 2.0271 for my 10 pips. The market went to 2.0272 before it started retracing. It took 25 minutes to get my 10 pips, but now I have over $200 in my account and zero losses out of 14 trades. So, I would say that I'm doing something correct.... Remember, the market may change, but turning points(even if you know nothing of pivot numbers) within the market will never change. NEVER! Happy trading, CT

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Yes CT you are doing something correct, keep up the good work! God Bless and Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Jogjatrader, Hey buddy, how did you do on your pips today? Man, if my insight was better, and I would have known to sell the market, I would have made at least 50 pips with ease today. Oh well, I thank the universe and nature for doing what it's been doing for me for the last 14 trades. peace, CT

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Jog, You mentioned that there would be another technique you would show me that would allow me not to worry about my finances ever again in this trading game. I'm ready now for whatever technique you have that could get me to the next level. Can you explain it here? thanks, CT

--- 帖子 #97 ---
guys/gals, Tell you what, in 30 minutes I got my pips and cake too! For those who are on fxcm 's brokerage platform, at exactly 2:30am EST time a hangman formed and 10 minutes later an "up candle" confirmed which way the hangman was trying to tell the smart money which way to go. The smart $ said to buy and I did just that at 2.0168/2.0172 level and exited at 2.0182 level for my FULL 10 pips profit for the night in 30 minutes flat; although I could have stayed in and gotten more pips without a doubt. But, my philosophy is to hit the market hard and fast. 10 pips allows me to stay in the market long enough to get 10 pips, but not long enough for the market to turn around on me and have me waiting an additional 30 minutes to seversal hours for anything over 10 full pips profit. Also, like Jogjatrader mentioned 10-20 pips per night is 100% guaranteed if your willing to be patient and listen to the market(hangman's, morning star reversals, and true hammer; all being either above 80% william or below 20% william). Keep in mind that I will be able to double my account, which I already did, every two weeks. In other words, I will double my account twice per month without no problem. And, the only day that I won't trade on is the day of NON-FARM Payroll day. Happy Trading CT

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Folks, Tonight, I spend only 2 hours and 12 minutes total time of looking at the market and trading. As I speak the market just hit 2.0192 level and that would have been a 20 pip profit(full 20 pips including the 4 pip spread) for me had I stayed in the market. But, doubling my account twice per month is a dream come true and 10 pips daily will get me there and that customized Mercedes Brabus CLS550 is just around the corner for me.. Well guys, keep the board posted as to what and how you guys are doing on the smart money side. For you guys that are still on the dumb money side, my best advice is for you get together with Jogjatrader and clarify what he is trying to teach. Other than that, make sure you go through every board looking for what has worked for others and make it your own; just like I took Jogjatrader's williams % advice and turned it into a money machine for myself. Have a good night everyone, CT

Did you see the candle formation (hanging man, morning star, etc) on 5 mnt charts or other time frames? thx

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Aristo, I only use the 5 minute chart for trading the market which is always good for 10-20 pips daily. The candle formations occur on all time frames; but personally, I like using the 5 minute chart. When I used to trade the S&amp;P 500 Index futures market(before I ever heard of Currency Trading), I used to only trade the 1-minute chart and it worked well for me. Did you get in any trades during the european session? CT

--- 帖子 #102 ---
good job everyone, one thing I noticed is that you need to be quick on some of these setups on the 5 min. I am still in demo mode, but have tried to make some trades just a few minutes to late, and it went against me, when if I had been there 5-10 earlier I would have been fine. I may be a little to liberal on taking signals, but I am also happy with a smaller pip return. 3-5 is ok for me. (I also don't profess a full understanding of this method though, thus still in demo)

MC, Keep trading the demo dude. Do it until you have full confidence of getting 10 pips per day. Believe me when I say that 10 pips occur every single day; except the day of Non-Farm Payroll, in this market man. It occurs as surely as I'm typing this message to you and it happens abundantly But, for the kicks of it; let's just say that you want to set up a schedule where you don't want to trade daily. Let's just say that you only want to trade twice per week and get 10 pips that way. Even with that pace, you can double your account once every 5 weeks; JUST TRADING TWO TIME WEEKLY FOR 10 PIPS EACH TIME. Doing that alone would mean that if you start your account balance, with some broker like Oanda .com, with only $100 you could have an account balance of $102,000 in a 12 month period. Mind you, you can reach that point if you don't take anything out for 12 full months. And, this is for only those people who want to trade ONLY two times per week for 10 full profitable pips each time. To say the least, that is peas in a pan my friend.... CT

Yeah man, it's all good bro. As long as I keep it at 10 or a little more sometimes, I'll double my account twice monthly. Keep pippin it man... ct

Hey currencytrader, First, congrats on your success so far. Is there any reason why you only trade the European session? It would seem the NY session would be in more agreement with your regular schedule. Thanx J Stone

hey guys, sorry for not posting anything lately coz i have been sick for 3 days now, influenza, headache, just lying in my bed looking those money fly away.... CT, i still remember my promise to you, i'll email you soon anyway, for everone new here, please note my system takes practice try to look every opportunity try it and learn from it i have 2 aspect about my system that i havent post it yet : 1. my trading style 2. risk management 3. Trading hours ( i will keep posting it) once again william % in 5m works as signal with no flaws 10 to 20 pips in asian and european market, but in us market the price move so fast up-down that one can easily miss direction and lose money. beware i also use support and resistance level combine it with william, my system can predict early day trend movement, look for william 5m 15m 1H combination near support or resistance especially near high or lows trade it and ride the trend (trend in GBPUSD always start on european market open, try to open your eyes and trade it with tight stop....bang you just score pips a lot) _________________________ see yaaa.... Happy harvesting pips

Dunlop, When I first got started with trading the currency market, the first question I asked myself was, "which session had the most volume and movement and which currency pair had the most volume and movement?"... Well, research indicated(and we must all do our homework) that the top 140 biggest banks in the world are located in London!! That's not a mistake my friend. There's a reason for that. The reason is because London is the currency capital trading center of the world! Now, the next truth I learned was that if this is the case, and it is, then trading the eur/usd would be logical. But, what I found out was that although the eur/usd was a good pair to trade, the gbp/usd was a better "volatile pair" to trade during the London session. So, based on these two known truths, I stopped trying to trade the eur/usd and started trading the gbp/usd. Another thing is that since the top 140 biggest banks in the world are also located in London, these very same banks trade during the London session. That's all I needed to know and understand for me to not even tough the U.S session(although it is the second largest session)... CT

Jogjatrader, I hope that you get better from you're sickness. Make sure to drink plenty of juice and water(that means NO AMERICAN BEER for you..hehe). Get better first then come back to us. You're not going to do anyone any bit of good 6 feet in the wrong direction.. I'm going through some pain myself right now and don't know what to do. You see, I still have all my wisdon teeth in my mouth. The top two wisdon teeth are growing straight down and isn't causing any problems at all. The lower right wisdon tooth is above the gum line and itsn't causing any problems for my teeth neither because it's growing straight up and no crooked. But, my lower left wisdom tooth(oh my GOD) is hurting right now. It's growing up straight, but what is happening is that once a year or so, it tries to grow and what happens is that every time that happens it swells the back gums of my lower left jaw to the point of me being barely able to open my mouth wide enough to eat food. When I do force my mouth open wide enough, the pain is excruciating. Does anyone know what do in order to make the swelling of my gums receed so that I can at least open my mouth wide enough to eat? And, lastly, how long does this normally last? I remember that last year this pain and swelling lasted for about 4 or 5 days straight; but I forgot what I did in order to make the swelling go down. Thanks for any help, CT

Look at the gbp/usd right now and you'll see that from about 11am(central time or 12pm eastern time) the market has been consolidating like crazy. That means a huge movement is about to occur in one direction or another. I won't say which way it will go, but I will say that when it happens, I'll make sure to be in on the smart money side. That's the best prediction I can give... CT

Hey yall... I hope you guys didn't get confused as to what the truth was tonight, as far as getting your 5-10 full profitable pips were concerned. The market was very tricky. Veryyyyy..tricky Here's what happened and what I did: On the fxcm .com real time trading platform(chart), at 1:35am(everything is central time with me), the market formed a beautiful hammer; just beautiful. The problem was, was that the hammer was neither above 80% or below 20%, so I skipped that one because I only buy/sell in overbought/oversold areas ONLY! Second, at 1:45am, the market formed a "hangman". On this one, the market was above 80% william which told me that it was overbought. But, the next candle confirmed that the market was still wanting to go up. So, if that was the case, and the mkt was overbought, I wasn't going to be ignorant enough to put my account in a bad position. So, I stayed out of the market. Third, at 2:00am sharp, the market formed another "hangman" while the william % was above 80% again, but the next candle was another 'up' candle which confirmed more up movement. Now, I tell you folks what, when I keep seeing this and knowing full well that the mkt is overbought, I don't do a darn thing but sit still and be patient. Lastly, finally at 2:10am, the market forms a hammer and the william % is still over 80%. I sell market when I see it going down. I sell at 2.0384 level and get my 10 full pips profit by exiting at 2.0369 level. The market still has room to go down. Right now the mkt is at 2.0376 level but might even go down to the 2.0361 level just to try to test the bottom again. So, my whole trading day lasted one hour and 37 minutes tonight, but I was only in the market actively for less than 10 minutes of that.. Remember, that the gbp Trade Balance news comes out at 3:30am this morning, so that is going to affect the movement greatly also... Happy trading, CT

Hey Guys, Jogatrader how are you? Where you affected by the 7.4 earthquake? I hope you get better and I want to think you for this wonderful system that you created. I have gained another 10+ PIPS today and my account balance continue to increase. CurrencyTrader I wish I had some solution for your tooth. I hope that pain goes away. I'm at work now and I will talk with you all later. God Bless and Happy Trading.

And, the good ol u.s. of a don't give them enough credit for there beauty in the beauty contests. I think you probably have already read my post to Jogjatrader about my Indonesian girlfriend that I dated while I was in college. Well, hope your trading is going well.. ct

warlock, I wish I could give you advice. I'm not sure if the trend is going up or down my friend. I only know what I need to know at the moment the market tells me exactly what to do; the direction of the market on the 10 minute chart, 15 min. chart, or 1 hr chart is ill-relevant to me. Simply, because I'm only going for my 10 pips and that's it. Study Jogjatrader's easy technique and experiment with it as though you were a mad scientist, because truthfully, your whole success depends on how angry and how hungry you are for massive success...

Wow, I just added +40 PIPS to my account balance. I started trading The Tenno System on last Sunday 8/5/07, with a starting balance of $124.64. As of 1:02am Eastern Standard time, my account balance is $219.64. I have been trading a mini lot (10K) and just simply following the directions and listening to what the wise traders in this thread is doing (ex: Following Candlestick Patterns, Pivot Points, etc). I enjoy this blessing and I'm truly thankful for God for letting me find this thread and meeting such fantastic people. Thank you Jogatrader and CurrencyTrader you guys are a blessing and I'm truly thankful please keep up the good work and I hope the both of you are feeling better. Long story short I have profited 76.22% in 5 days!!!

Awesome, It just goes to show you that it can be done and whatever you're doing, keep on keepin on baby... Well, I'm still waiting for the market action to heat up since the 'position' traders, hedge funders, and major banks will want to reallocate and reposition themselves for this coming weekend. It should be a good ride early this morning.. CT

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Jogjatrader, Awesome, and everyone else: Well, it was evident where the market was headed, at least temporarily. At 2:10am(central time) or 3:10am Eastern time, the market created a beautiful hammer, the william % was under 20% for sure, and that told me to buy the market. I bought market at 2.0172 level(for some reason the volume was high enough for my spread to be only 3 pips instead of the normal 4 pips) and exited at 2.0188 for a full 13 pip profit for the night. I finished in less than 10 minutes total active trading time and my total time looking at the actual market was exactly(even as I type this message) was one hour and 34 minutes... Now, that's cookin the market....17 for 17 trades with no losses... CT

The erath quake did woke up in the middle of the night but there are no casualties. its quite funny when everybody panic and scatter around but nothing happen....anyway everything is good i have gain my health again, ihope i will start harvesting pips on next monday. i read everybody doing fine on applying my system, here whats new : i accidentally hit 1m chart it was on william.......man there are many many opportunity especially us market........not getting too anxously but when i compare it with 5m chart there are similarity, i try to connect the fact but i havent find the best way to use it but it worth to try...... try this on demo acc, do Tenno system on this new time frame campare it mostly with 5m chart learn the cycle ,test it to determine the most profitable entry and exit strategy......i still studying it carefully just for demo acc ________________ Happy Trading dont let those pips fly away

Good to hear from you Jog, hope all is well. The 1 min is interesting, did a quick look back through the the last couple of hours, and everytime its above 20 or below 80, you could have made at least 4 pips. subtract your spread, and you have 1-2 pips on every trade. 15 trades in last 2 hours. That is acttually ignoring 2 other oppurtunities because I would not open a trade if I already had one open. I watched for candle outside of 20/80 range, and opened trade on open of next candle. Didnt look for any candlestick formations, Used only the williams. The longest drawdown time was 12 mins. That would be a minimum of 15 pips profit in roughly two hours. That is pretty impressive. Its definitely worth testing this further over a longer time period, and in different market conditions.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
It looks like the thing that would kill this method would be when it gets into a very strong trend, possibly post news, so you would need to watch for that or use stops. with a rule to not re-enter until after it comes back between the 80/20 for a certain period of time, not sure what that would be yet, but will look at it more. just while I have been typing this, I have made 6 pips using just the 1 min williams.

Hi CurrencyTrader, Hello Jogatrader it's good to know that you are feeling better and that the earthquake did not harm you and yours. I appreciate that hard work and effort and I'm truly thankful. Hello CurrenyTrader, Way to go today! I looked back at that 2:10 hammer it was a beauty and I see it was followed by a nice shooting star. What a great way to end the trading week. Do you have any advice on money mangement with this system. My goal is to also double my money twice per month? I was thinking of increasing my mini lot by 1 mini lot every week only if I had a winning week. What's your advice on that? Well I will talk with you Sunday night for I will be trading the Asian Session around 8pm eastern time after I get off of work. God Bless Everyone and Happy Trading.

Awesome, Well, I'm not here to tell you what to do; but I will certainly tell you what I would do for money management and about doubling your money twice per month. This is going to sound very freakish and is against all laws of natural common sense. You ready?... I don't use money management in my trades to a certain extent. I just know that history has already shown me what was true 3,000 years ago, while Egyptians where trading Camels, are the same natural laws that are true today while trading the gbp/usd. There's no difference in the movements; just like there was really no difference between Newton discovering gravity at 32 feet per second and the fact that that law already existed before he discovered it! When something is overbought to an extreme or oversold to an extreme and there's a right turn signal, natural forces will push the object in another direction; it just happens to be that this direction is either up or down for traders; or when the market is in perfect equilibrium there's just a good ol' consolidation. For this reason, I very rarely, if at all, use any kind of stop loss(money management). The only management I use is the 10 pip profit management..hehehe Like I said, this point of view is really freaky and to the man/woman with common sense, it would be contrary to all that a person would read. But, I have proven 17 different times, that I never used a stop loss(the most the market ever went against me was 7 pips) and that it can be done. But, thinking so is the hardest part to overcome.... peace and happy weekend folks, CT

Awesome, Contrary to what 95% of all traders believe, I'm here to tell you that doubling your money once every two weeks is possible. Or, if you wanted to take some pressure off of yourself and only wanted to trade 3 times a week, you could still double your account every month. And this is an encouraging thought my friend. Imagine, starting with what you have; let's say $200 for example. Double that once per month, trading only 3 times per week, for only 10 full pips profit on each trade, and at the end of a 12 month period, without as much as touching 2 cents of your account money, you could create a little bit over $817,000 in income for yourself. And, I hate to say this, but that's pretty simple if you can keep doing what you're presently doing, don't get a big head, keep your ego low, respect the market at all times, and don't touch a penny of your money for 12 months. Now, if you're interested in doubling your money twice monthly, well, you could make $1.6 million or so your first 12 months. But, I wouldn't put that much pressure on myself to double my account twice per month. But, doubling once per month is guaranteed no matter what! CT

Hello CurrencyTrader, I thank you so much for responding to my question. We will definetly double our money monthly. Well, we had a great trading week and I pray and hope that this coming week will be even better. I look forward to talking with you regarding our coming success this coming week. I will talk with you later again thanks for your help. God Bless and Happy Trading. I ended today with another +10 PIPS

Awesome, It may seem that I'm staying up late, at this moment, but I'm doing some research on Hawaii and in particular the island I'll be living on which is Oahu. You can definately repeat the process and success that you had last week man. It's as easy as you're willing to make it. The same thing happens over and over again in the market at the turning points, reversal points, pivot levels, support/resistence levels, etc..etc...over and over and over again. It's like taking candy from a baby without making the baby cry! Matter of fact, the baby will never cry because it will never know when the candy will get jerked out of it's hands... Have a great weekend, CT

You haven't "proved" anything. I wish you good trading, but any noobs reading this should be aware that trading without stops is foolish. If you continue making money, you will be lucky. The Egyptian camel analogy doesn't change the fact that strong trends do happen from time to time, and will wipe out an account that is heavily leveraged. Don't become a statistic.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
tdion, With the anger from your writing, it sounds to me like you are writing from a position of being on the wrong side of the market. The last thing I want or need is for anyone to "wish me good trading". I create my own good trading based on what works in the real world of trading. But, of course, you and everyone else knows that I said in my latest post that what I would say would be against all common sense, so I pretty much expected a response, like yours, from somebody. That was to be expected. Also, you made a note that the market does move in a strong direction from time to time. Well, if you know the gbp/usd well enough, you'll also understand that this time to time strong movement happens in the gbp/usd 2 to 3 times per week; over and over and over again. But, when it does happen, I'm always on the correct side no matter what. I'm just in for my 10 pips; even if the market moves 120 pips. Now, I won't wish you well on your trading; but I do hope, for your own sake, that you're doing well in your trading career. My job is not to prove anything to you or any other person. I've done proved what I have needed to prove to myself already, and will continue to do so long after you have given up on this trading game; since stats says that more than likely, you'll give up based on the 90-95% failure rate. But, who knows, you might surprise yourself and remain purserverent enough to succeed. That part will be up to you and that's the only part that you'll have to prove to yourself. Have a great weekend, CT

Note the contradiction between his two last posts. Let's see. I have been a member here since 2005, and haven't "given up." In fact, I trade for a living. I am highly educated. I don't take huge risks. You, on the other hand, have "done proven" that you will probably blow your account by not using stops just like the people here: http://www.collective2.com/cgi-perl/...72042145628084 "Good trading" is a polite thing to say to fellow traders. As you gain more experience, you will learn these things. I can't blame you, I was a noob myself once. -cheers

Tdion, Son, I've been trading for the last 15 years, in 8 different markets. My uncle, who boxed in the navy, came out swinging in the markets and got me hooked at a young age. So, don't tell me how "highly educated" you are; because like my "poor" momma used to say, "don't be so highly educated until you become a educated foo boy"....that's strong black women for you alright..hehe It doesn't matter if you take huge risk or small risk. Cause guess what? You're either on the wrong side of the market or on the right side of the market. Also, take note that the 17 trades that I have done in the currency market delt strictly with the gbp/usd. I was trading the eur/usd alot longer, which was the original pair I began with back in 2002. Before that I was in commodities and then hit the S&amp;P 500 Index Futures. So, while your so called 'edumicated', I'm specifically educated to trade the markets, was breeded to trade the markets, and that's what I specialize in. I know alot of 'highly educated' PHD's my boy.... Now, like the other poster that had a bad attitude, I'm going to tell you what I told him, either you get a good attitude and bring something positive to this board, or get you're narra azz to another board with your bad attitude. People aren't here for other people to read criticisms. We are here to learn a trick or two to add on to whatever experiences we are bringing to the game. So, this is my last post to you, unless you can get a better attitude. Use that highly educated mind of yours to get a better attitude or don't post your negative attitude here at all. Got Milk...

Tdion, The link below that you posted is for an automated trading program. What person in there right mind would blindly trade an automated system. Every single looser that I have ever spoken to have at one point or another traded blindly with some automated trading system; and then these very same people have the nerve to ask why they are loosing. Anytime you put your faith, blindly, without going through the necessary work in order to get real world trading experiences for your own benefit, in a system that doesn't prove itself, you're in trouble. The best system is a system that works for YOU. No shortcuts, no laziness, and no if's..and's...or but's.... Approximately 100% of the most successful traders, from George Soros(the wealthiest currency trader in the world) on down have all done two things: Blown there accounts lots of times and have created there own systems so that they wouldn't blow there accounts again...

Good guys, can there be a situation where you enter a trade. all the 3 TFs confirmed it, and it happens that william % range stick to oversold or overbought as the case may be but the price is moving against you. or the trend suddenly changes. how do you filter that out? i hope i put it in a way you understand me. thanks

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Push your snake oil. People needed to be aware that trading without stops is a recipe for disaster. You've been trading for 15 years? Why aren't you retired yet? As for mechanical systems.... that's all I trade. I build them myself, so its the same as me trading them manually. Just without the emotion. Tenno may be a nice scalping method. Time will tell if it continues. I guess I'll see you back here 15 years from now, still practicing the same "overleveraged" money management, hyping on the threads, etc... As for education: Would you rather take the advice of someone with a BS and a MS in Computer Science (highly analytical degrees, excellent for risk management) or someone that claims he knows the markets? PS) Is +800% this year enough "edjumucation" for you? PSS) The HawkFX link can be autotraded, but there is a human executing the trades. A human that traded w/ no stop losses, had a nice run, and then blew the account. Mods please delete this argument. But please leave my warning for no SLs.

Hello CurrencyTrader, Wow! LOL Yes I'm so ready for this coming week! Let's do it all over again my friend!!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Well, for me I follow the candlestick pattern on the 5 minute chart and Sidius Method on the 1 hour chart, it shows the temporary trend. Last week I saw a signal that was against the trend so I said no I will not place a trade, I then saw a shooting star and the next candle started to shoot up in the direction of the signal. I then placed the trade for 10 PIPS and reached my limit and got out. Always remember that the trend is your friend and if you do get a signal against the trend if you decide to trade it get out quickly, you might want to think about it before placing a trade. I hope this helped God Bless and Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Awesome, Yeah, you're right about that man, this is one big laugh..hehe... Well, nonetheless, the market makes the same moves over and over again, and last weeks success can be repeated this coming week. From now on, anytime, there's a negative post against what I say, I'll ignore it because now it's not about trying to argue, it's about NOT wasting my time arguing with anyone on this board. My bank account is all I want to argue for me. I'll leave the verbal spillage for those who want to initiate while I make the real 'cents' in the market. All, I can say is that anyone who is loosing money in the gbp/usd, just think of me taking it from you with a smile on my face ... And, there's no real argument to that.... Hey Jogjatrader, how ya feelin dude? peace, CT

Acko, Now, here's a gentlemen that knows what it means to have a positive attitude no matter what perceptions may have been breached by something written differently than what you're used to seeing. I like you already man... Hey, listen up, the best traders are no different than you are, no smarter than you are, don't have a higher I.Q than you have, and we all take the same squat for a good dump.. The only minor difference is that some of us have more EXPERIENCE with understanding the currency pair and all the small movements that it makes and then take advantage of those movements without second guessing. Some people love to swing trade and thus needs to be on the hour chart instead of the 5 minute chart. Others need a 4 hr chart to catch nothing less than 200 pips in one direction. As for me, I need to see results here, now, and fast. I'll hit the market hard and lightning fast. Choose one of the top 3 currency pairs to trade and love it to death. Know the hooks and the turns like you know the knot on the back of your head. Specialize in one currency pair because they each have there own personalities. The gbp/usd don't act like eur/usd. They may have the same movement, but the volatility difference between them is alot greater and the signals that I use for the gbp/usd may not even work for the eur/usd on the 5 minute level. Specialize..specialize...specialize... CT

Boy, sure is fun in forex trading hello guys.....CT, awesome.....everybody....please keep those positive thinking with all your trades, and get rid those scammer out of your mind Tell you this, remember my post about william on 1m chart, well i have been tested it quite a while, i came to one conclusion : The Rule is the same, william on 1m is good as trigger to filter those signal on 5m chart; if william on 5m chart is heading downward wait untill william 1m head downward also .....and you are in the right direction for profit take 10 t0 20 pips and wait for another signal, to be more successful look for confirmation on 15m and 1H (sidus) william on 1m act randomly use it wise wait for confirmation directed by 5m chart never choose direction based on william 1m only, you'll get whipsaw, use it temporarely i have made more accurate decision by combining william 5m and 1m, first, standby to sell or buy based on william 5m second, wait william 1m untill it move the same as 5m direction third, set target 10 pips first, if the direction persist according 5m or 15m do set next target to 20 pips or less based on your experience william 1m is for scalping, use it only to support your decision on 5m there are pattern on william 1m in us trading session....profitable 2 - 5 pips average do the tenno system rule, try it on demo you will like it....

OK this 1min thing is pretty fun, just sat down for 20 mins and took 9 pips away! That is a good day! slightly different rules for me than Jog is talking about, but it is working for me (at least for now) will keep forward testing and go live in a week or so if it keeps working.

GBPUSD trading cracked.....i have found very profitable method using Tenno System in any market condition you can still profit minimum 25 pips or 25 dollar maximum is up to you daily (full time) only using william percentage range on selected time frame, its a rather complicated system but when you are done practising 1 - 2 month you will got it as long as you live. my recent quest on overcome tenno system weakness has ended, i have found the way to fix the weakness. i am writing down my complete Tenno System how-to, soon i will post it here its all about timing the market ______________ pips or die .......God Bless

Thats funny.............i took soooo many pips today, 9 pi is too few to say... well its ok as long as you gain the profit you are on your way my friend keep posting your result pls post also your price and time may the pips go with you........... _______________________ glad to help other trader

Mc, 9 pips is a good day. As you get the hang of it, you'll get a better feel for what is a good amount of pips to take from the market in certain situations. Keep it movin dude. You're doing well so far. Just keep doing what works and don't make it complicated. Money talks and bullsh*t walks. So, keep makin the money man... CT

Jogjatrader, I saw what I did wrong today. I let a simple candlestick formation slip by my fingers. It's no big deal because I learned from what I missed. But, I can assure you it won't happen again. Today was one of those down days where the market just tumbled. It does this on the normal basis 2-3 times weekly and had I been paying me attention to a certain formation, I would have profited instead of sitting on the side. But, that's o.k by me. I'll just get on the smart money side tomarrow and get my 10 pips and call it a night. I'm interested in your new updated system. Please hurry and and get it done man..hehe CT

jog, I just looked at the 1 minute chart for todays trading, as well, as some past historical trades that I could have done in the 1 minute time frame. I haven't looked at the one minute chart in a long..long time man. You can just see all the support and resistence levels just hanging all over each other like glue. I would be so easy, trading the gbp/usd on the one minute chart, because of both the volatility and the support/resistence areas that are so viewable. CT

I'm on break at work today and I made another +10 PIPS, Sunday Evening on the 8pm eastern candle (long). I use CMSFX (Vtrader Chart) is you have this broker you can view this time on the 15 minute chart. I can't wait to get off tonight to trade the Asian Session. I hope everyone is having just as much of fun as I am. Thank you Jogatrader for making this system better and better I will start practicing your new tool tonight. God Bless and Happy Trading! Hello CurrencyTrader, I see you in the thread, What's up!!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Awesome, Well, one of these days you won't have to be on some J-O-B break my friend. You'll be able to create your own breaks anytime, anywhere, and on any terms you please. The 3rd week of next month, I'll be leaving for Hawaii from Missouri man. I can't stand this state..hehe.. Anyway, I'll fit right in in hawaii and I can't wait to get there... Well, I'm glad your doing well with your trades. Keep it up.. CT

Awe, I'm just waiting for the london session to get cooking. Right now, I'm just sitting back, eating me a bag of Flaming Hot Lays potato chips(no matter what junk food I eat, my metabolic rate is so high my body just eats straight through it all), and playing me an old game of Donkey Kong Jr. on the labtop. In other words, I'm just chilin man.... CT

That sounds relaxing. I wish I had your metabolism, LOL. I just finished snacking on a few cheetos myself. Well I will be up during London Session waiting for my current trade to hit. I'm in the positive so it should not be long, I hope the market is moving slow at this time. Thank God i'm off tomorrow. I shall talk with you later. God Bless and Happy Trading.

Gang, Well, I'm 18 for 18 now with no losses and 100% knockouts... Tonight was no different(or this morning). At 2:15am, central time, or 3:15am Eastern time, the market created a hammer. I sold that hammer at 2.0120 level. The market initially went down, but then went 11 pips against me. NO BIG DEAL. I was just patient because I knew that the market had to come down and it was overbought at the 11 pip level so, I just sat back, at some potato chips, and waited for the market to go down to 2.0106 level, which it did at 2:50am, which means I was in the market for 35 minutes for my 10 pips. And, as you guys can see, the market went even futher down than the 2.0106 level, even as I type this message. But, I got my 10 and that's that.... Happy Trading! CT

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I sold at 2:54AM 2.0112 AND PROFIT HIT AT 2.0102. I saw the 1 min headed down followed by the 5min, 15 min, and the Sidus Method was also overbrought. This was my second trade of today. I placed two trades because one counts for today and one counts for yesterday since I work during the day. I have profited on both trades making a total of +15 PIPS. Thanks again Jogatrader and I will talk with you yall later. God Bless and Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Awesome, Good going. Yes, if anyone sees that the william is either at overbought or oversold, and the same thing is happing on 2 other time frames above the one that you're on, then you best be selling or buying in that direction because it's guaranteed that you're going to score. Knowing when to get the hell out is a different matter. But, that's the reason why going for 10-20 pips is important; even if the market does a 50 pip, or more, move. Not knowing to get out is the very reason why position traders, who are in the big money, all of a sudden, loose there whole accounts. It's because they have no idea when to get out of the market and just guess when they should be getting out. CT

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Folks, I forgot to mention that when I took that trade, with the hammer signal, that hammer wasn't above the 80% william. That's the reason why it went 11 pips against me before turning around. What I should have done was waited, more patience, and if I had done so, at around 2:45am central time, the market would have gotten me a sell anyway with a morning star reversal signal. That signal did occur with the william % being over 80% and that would have been the trade that I should have gone for. But, due to the fact that the previous hammer hit a resistence and I knew what I was doing, I went ahead and traded the hammer anyway. Under any other circumstance, and I would have never traded that hammer. As nature would have it, the morning star formed and confirmed what I already knew what was about to happen; and as a result, the market dropped over 80 pips with ease.... Talk to you guys tomarrow.. CT

do you check Spud 1Hr as well or you don't?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I'm not sure if you all realize this, but what you're doing is trading the swings in what is often a ranging market. There are occasionally some big moves in Cable during Asian/European markets, but most of the time you see a slow steady trend or a single reversal. It's a good system from what I can gather. It actually reminds me of a few things in the Farley book. The Williams' %R oscillator that you're using measures where the current price close is in relation to the range of the last N period of bars. N being 14 in this case. When the Williams' is overbought or oversold, the current candle is near a high or low for the past N periods. By watching the oscillators in both an M15 and M5 chart, you're able to catch the extreme a bit more clearly. If you open an order based on the 5 minute chart, you're catching the potential top or bottom in the next price swing. By verifying on the 15 minute chart, you make sure that your 14 period Williams oscillator on the 5 minute chart is not missing the "bigger picture" of price position in the current movement. The only reason I post this is because anyone using any system out there should know how their tools work in case they stop working. Next month the asian market could change its swing period and you may need to go more or less than the "14" currently prescribed. The Sidus method on the 1 hour chart is really just an MA crossover system which helps determine the larger (main for our purposes) trend. I'll try to lay the system out a bit more clearly so people can understand it as these other guys are a little bit wacky No offense intended CT and Jogja! Wacky is not a bad thing if it works. Guide 1.) Set your work area with H1, M15, and M5 GBP/USD charts. Trade during Asian and European hours. ( I'm not totally clear on this, could someone clear up when this strategy is most appropriate ) 2.) Add a Williams' %R oscillator to the all charts with a period of 14 bars Jogja uses a 3,5,21 EMA on the M15 and M5 charts. I'm not sure this is necessary because price action should be relatively visible. If you don't mind the clutter it's further confirmation of trends 3.) Draw horizontal bars at key support and resistance levels for the day. This includes any key turning points, consolidation areas, the daily high, and the daily low. Trendlines and price channels may help as well. Pivot Points may be added as well. I think it's a good idea, but it doesn't seem necessary. Treat the other key S/R levels as "heavier" concrete barriers if you will. They'll often deflect price, but once broken, price often has enough momentum to carry it to the next area of S/R. 4.) On the H1 chart, add an 18 EMA and a 28 EMA. I don't really think the others are necessary for our purposes, but you can include them if you wish. When the two EMAs cross, the trend is changing. The wider apart they are, the stronger the trend. The closer they are, the weaker the trend. Read up on the Sidus method in his thread if you want to know more. 5.) Check to see if price is near key areas of S/R. Higher probability setups will be near S/R. 6.) If the slope of the H1 Williams' oscillator is downwards and the overall trend is downwards, check your M15 chart. If the M15 Williams' oscillator is in the overbought zone (over 80), check the M5 for a similar condition. If your stars are all aligned, open a sell order with a stoploss of 5 or so once the Williams' oscillator has turned and has started making its way down to below the 80 line. Exit Target: Once the Williams' oscillator has crossed into oversold and is turning back towards the 20 line. CurrencyTrader uses candlestick patterns near S/R and pivot levels to help him identify key points of reversal or congestion. This allows him to profit mainly on the 5 minute chart from what I understand, taking in high probability setups for 10 pips a trade. While these setups may not come extremely often, they likely offer a high probability of success. 7.) A buy order is just the opposite, I don't think there's much need for me to describe it in detail. PLEASE, correct me if I'm wrong anywhere on here. As you can see, this is a little bit different from most other systems on FF and to get it to work, you're going to HAVE TO make it your own. I can't stress that enough. You need to understand your indicators and what they're telling you. This is not a system for new traders. As a new trader, you will do better understanding and learning to trade momentum. I'd argue you need to understand momentum before you can really trade swings. Once again, this is not a system for new traders , and what CT is doing is very risky. He's trading highly leveraged on a large chunk of his account with no stoploss. If he has a connection problem or an order action fails and price moves against his position, he will lose his entire account. Money management is up to you, S/R levels are up to you. You can use fibs, murrey math, camarilla, whatever you understand best. This Tenno System is really just a framework for swing trading and its success will be based on your own additions and understanding of price movements on the Cable. Good luck everyone! Oh and I'm thinking of automating this based on the original method and candlesticks if anyone's interested in helping. I want to see how it backtests, and I can't stay up until 6AM trading with work at 9 heh. CurrencyTrader, you up for collaborating?

I use this system just like the first post. I have also made it my own by using candlestick patterns, pivot points, and as of yesterday I look at the 1 min timeframe. So i guess I have taken the main rules and added a few other rules I think will benefit me. I do appreciate everyones post and the way they trade I like to demo trade their tools and see if I like it and if it fits me. I hope this post helps. God Bless and Happy Trading!

Hi Mcmep11, Yesterday Jogatrader stated that he will post a how to trade the Tenno System. Hopefully this answer a lot questions or clear up misunderstandings we might have. I'm really looking forward to that. Hi Oeagrus, I usually trade during the Asian Session after I get off work. Since I'm off on Tuesday I try (if I see a signal) trade in the Euro Session as well, like I did this morning. Happy Tradings

--- 帖子 #181 ---
That was cute! I think watchout4me was referring to the Sidus Method. This morning before the market sold more than 100 PIPS. The Sidus showed a down trend and the 1, 5, and 15 min charts where overbrought heading down. I put a sell order in and quickly profited +10 PIPS. The market continued to go short. I like the Sidus Method because it's like an extra confirmation for me to sell or buy. It's definitely optional. I guess you can just Demo trade using it and if you like it use and if you feel it doesn't make a difference don't use, but at least you know how it works and knowledge is POWER. You guys are great and the more we post the more we learn (talking for myself) from each other.

Hi guys As the author of Tenno system i have to straight something here thanks oeagrus for your post in this thread, my system isnt so hard to follow basically its soo simple even for newbie but it will cost you lost if you dont practice it first on demo. Why i intend soo bad on practising, because one have to feel it right before u use it, i am talk about human mind, if ever someone use it as EA or automated or something those EA will lose something that my system require the most : HUMAN MIND, What CT and AWE do is they add human touch to my system with their own vision and create this system unique for themself thats what this system golden goal, you dont need fancy programming its all in your mind (you are so valuable to yourself, respect it and you will have a better life) I agree about limiting your trade with stop loss or something, but the point is not your stop its price behaviour or price action, the next evolution to my system is you understand how market works how currency behave and how fundamental works based on price movement. the trend may change the price may go up or down the price, no matter what market do, you are ready to take those money where ever, when ever in any amount you need......that what i called a future trader coz we trade future, we never know what future done to us good or bad but the dood thing is we are ready........ so guys, my system is unique make it unique to yourself add any necessary tool as you wish but dont forget to use william percentege range as your main tool....use Tenno system.........if you need to add other tool, use the ones that support Tenno Rule, get rid of anything that slow it down, so you dont get confuse.......but if you just cant use it....dont use it go find yourself system that fits you and get your own profit...... no matter what system u use if it give you loss trade....change it no matter what system even the most simple system as long it gets you profit....use it.... always it's all up to you..... currently i have finished 2 pages of my system how to.....gosh my english are bad....i need to learn it again........ by the way yesterday downtrend has been detected early by my system at 2.0130....look at william 5m at that price....the rest we leave it to sidus.... Many thanks......... _________________ Money machine is just on the way

MC, Like I said before, the only thing I took from jogjatrader was the william % concept. I made it my own by combining it with what I knew worked in the real world of trading. Other than that, I don't use the 15 minute or 1 hr chart. But, for those who are just starting out, make sure to take jogjatrader's system and make it your own by personalizing it according to your personality. CT

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Awesome, Like I said, what happened yesterday happens about 2 to 3 times per week man, and it happens like clockwork(maybe not to the tune of 100+ pips, but the same concept happens. This week, the market has done this lopsided type of move two times already. CT

Awe, The thing about hawaii is that a hurricane will hit it only once every 20 to 25 years bro; unlike Florida and the east coast which get's hit every single year, and sometimes 2 to 3 times in a year. But, if I can avoid it by moving to hawaii after this hurricane, all the better for me..hehehe CT

--- 帖子 #188 ---
jogjatrader, Once again, I keep telling people that it's not the system that matters. Even if the system is simple to trade, it's the person that makes the system understandable to themselves. For example, when I saw how you used the William % to discern when to get in and out of a trade, I added that proven concept to what I already knew about the market, from all the years of trading the eur/usd. I basically took what I knew about the eur/usd and applied it to the gbp/usd and took the william % and used it as an entry level technique; because I already knew when to get out of the market by the amout of pips I would have normally took from the market anyway. So, instead of my using the whole Tenno System; I took what I knew worked in the system and applied it to a currency pair that I knew was volatile enough for me to get 10 full pips per day no matter what the market condition was. The only day that I will never trade is the day of Non-Farm Payroll. I'll trade the day BEFORE Non-Farm, but NEVER the day of Non-Farm. On the day of Non-farm payroll, I'll sleep in like a baby, get up the next morning and go play a round of putt-putt(miniature golf) or go rolling bladding. CT

--- 帖子 #189 ---
CurrencyTrader, I live in Florida and you are so right about the hurricanes. I pray that no State get hit by any hurricane because I have been there with no power for weeks and everything that comes with those storms. I'm glad your moving somewhere you like. It's good to live life like you want even when your hit with the blows of life. It's all good and have fun packing and moving because that's the best part right? NOTT!! LOL God Bless

I caught another +11 PIPS this morning. Shooting star candle on the 11:15pm eastern time 5min time frame. The williams was overbrought on 1, 5, and 15 min timeframe. The Sidus Method was showing a downtrend. I put a market sell @ 1.9939 and closed the trade @ 1.9928. I stopped the trade and the trend continued to go short. I'm so thankful. God Bless and Happy trading!!!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Awesome, That's what I'm talkin bout baby... Now, the market is heating up and there's a trade just around the corner. I'll catch my 10 pips, then catch some shut eye(sleep for those who don't know ebonics.. ) Anyway, happy trading folks... CT

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Gang, This is what happened. First, a good dose of patience was needed for this trade in particular. Secondly, as most of you know, if you look at news, there will be 4 news items hitting the market very hard at 3:30 central. Now, at 2:10am and 2:15am Eastern time, the market gave off a hangman, that was oversold and a small hammer, that was also sold. The next candle at 2:20am Eastern time confirmed the upmovement. BAM! I'm in like Flynn on the buy side at 1.9880 and just sat back and relaxed while the market did it's magic. I exited at 1.9894 for my 10 wholesome pips for the night; although I could have waited and gotten out at the next resistence level at 1.9903 level or so... But, I got my 10 pips and that's all that matters. It took 25 minutes to get those 10 pips and my whole working day, including active trading, lasted one hour and 52 minutes... Can't ask for a better day than that Once again, I would like to thank Jogjatrader for showing another trick that works. I've already doubled my money once and this coming week, I'll be able to double it twice in a 4 week period. With this pace of trading, I'll have more money in my account, off of the gbp/usd alone, than I could ever have working for the man at a J-O-B that I absolutely hate; which has been every job I've ever had..hehe Someone asked me, after 15 years of me trading, why I haven't retired. That's a silly question considering the fact that George Soros, the richest currency trader in the world, with a networth of more than $10 Billion Dollars, is still trading the Pound Dollar. He's been trading for more than 40 years. He of all people should be retired. But when you do what you love, what is work for others, is just a hobby for you. I guess this is the same answer George Soros gives to people who ask him why he hasn't retired after trading over a 40 year period. Now, that I think about it, the only people that are really interested in retiring are the people who hate there jobs. I don't know of anyone, who actually loves what they do, talk about retiring from what they love. Things that make you go hmmmm..... Have a great night everyone. CT CT

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I take that back, although George Soros is the richest active currency trader in the world based on him trading his own institutional account, Warren Buffet has actually made more money in the shortest period of time. When the eur/usd first his the scene, Warren buffet bought over 1 million lots. Three years or so later, he made over $20 billion in the currency market. Weather he exited his trade or not is another story. But, he did make that much money in the market while he was, or is, still in the market. He did not trade his own account though. What he did was hire a currency expert trader to advise him of the position he should take in the market. He got in on that recommendation and cleaned house the way a mother cleans a baby's butt... But, George Soros, is still the man... CT

--- 帖子 #197 ---
CT, can you elaborate about your risk management? I only risk 3% of my equity in each trade. And based on that, collecting 10 pips every day, my account will take more than a month to double. Are you risking more per trade in order to double your account so rapidly? Alcastro

--- 帖子 #198 ---
If I may make another suggestion: It may be better to measure the distance of the previous movements to determine a TP rather than just arbitrarily picking a number like 10. If price is swinging in a price channel and the range of the channel is 30 pips, and you're only trading 14 pips (10 after the spread), you're missing almost half of the range. Let's say you get in a buy order 5 pips above the bottom of the potential next retracement in a price channel based on all your indicators. If the channel is 30 pips wide, your potential TP could be up to 25. I'd go at about 80-90%, setting a 20-22 pip TP and setting my stop loss to right under the channel at about 7. I chose 7 because this allows for 5 pips for movement back to the bottom of the channel and 2 pips to allow for some leeway). This way your Risk to Reward is a bit closer to 1:3 raw and about 1:2 with the spread, rather than 1:2 or 1:1 with the spread. However, it would take some chart time to determine if this is effective. PS - Thanks, Acko!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Al, What's up dude.... Some people risk 1% while others risk 5%. There's no certain rule that is right or wrong. The question becomes, what feels right for YOU? And, for ME, I'm a high risk trader. I'll take $100 and trade one lot with it and make 100 pips(thus turning it into $200) within 4 weeks. This means that I only need 25 pips per week to get what I want. That is only 5 pips a day. Or, if you only want to work 3 days a week for 10 pips each of those three days, you'll double your money. For ME, if I'm starting with $200, I'll trade 2 lots, but I'll double my money every month off of that. In all of my years of trading, all 15 years that is, I've traded everything from commodities to the S&amp;P 500 Index. I've always been a 'high risk' trader..and NEVER once have I blown my account. I believe the reason why I haven't blown my account is because I have always done what felt right for ME. Now, on the other hand, had I gone against my personality and character and was too conservative on my trades, I would have probably blown my account; even though it would seem like common sense that the 'seemingly' best way to trade is to trade from a conservative point of view. But, once again, only you know you and nobody can tell you how to trade the market. In essence, you trade your personality and character when you are trading the market. You begin to understand YOU when you begin to understand why you're either failing or succeeding in the market. As far as risk managment; like I said before in another post here, I don't have a stop loss. BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THAT! The more experienced I became the more I was beginning to understand ME and how I related to the market. When I first started trading the market I used to have stop losses; but not anymore. Since trading the currency market, starting with the eur/usd when it first came out, the market never went against me more than 9 pips for the eur/usd. And, now, for the gbp/usd, the market has never gone against me more than 19 pips; and this mind you, was during the most volatile of news items coming out! On a calm day, like yesterday, the market never goes against me more than 4 pips because I know and understand the personality of the market. I know what it normally does and what it doesn't normally do. In the worst possible situation, the market went 19 pips against me, and I stayed in the market because I knew where it was going to go and I knew that the market was either overbought to the extreme or oversold to the extreme and that the market would act like a rubber band and sling shot it's way in my original direction. When this happens, instead of me getting 10 pips, I'll get 15 or 20 pips instead. The better you know your pair the more you can focus on what works for that pair and what doesn't. That's why I keep saying, specialize..specialize..specialize... CT

Alcostro, Trading is all about lifestyle. The kind of lifestyle I like to live is one of short hours but nearly unlimited income. I'm NEVER up more than 3 and a half hours looking at the market, including trading the market! I choose 10 pips because I know that 10 pips, per day, can take me where I want to go. I know that 10 pips can get me the shortest amount of time in the market without having to have to stay in the market any longer than I need in order to live the kind of lifestyle I want. For example, when I move to Hawaii at the end of next month, my trading hours will be from 7pm-10pm(or 10:30pm at the latest). This is the kind of 'dream style' lifestyle that I have always invisioned. I've always invisioned being able to trade after supper, but still be in bed before 11pm, when the human bodies natural algorithms are in tune with the quietness of night; but still able to get up at 6am or 7am in the morning. Ten pips per day creates this kind of lifestyle for me. Other people may want 12 pips per day or 15 pips per day. It all boils down to what you want and the kind of lifestyle you want to live in the process of getting what you want... CT

Mind you, the Euro came out in the late 90s. But then we find: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=499 Is he a newbie or is he a seasoned trader? I wish he'd make up his mind....

yes ,,, i was wondering about 15 years of trading for an account balance of $69....

--- 帖子 #203 ---
$1 a pip is more in line with a mini-lot I think...

T, Whenever I say that I'm doing well, with a system, once again, by default what I'm trying to say is that I'm taking a certain part of a system and applying it to what I already know. I took a certain technique from forexexpert and applied it and it worked. Now, I'm taking a certain technique from jogjatrader and it's working along with the technique I took from forexexpert. This is what I mean when I talk about my high percentage winning. Sorry for the confusion. Excitement does that sometimes... Yes, the eur/usd came out in 1999 and I was just coming off of trading the S&amp;P 500 Index during that same year... CT

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Andrew, The $69 was for the gbp/usd pair only. I WAS working with the eur/usd, but all the techniques that I learned while trading the eur/usd, I simply scooted them over to the gbp/usd side and added two more tricks; mainly from forexexpert and jogjatrader and a couple of others. There's about 12 tricks underneath my sleeves that I work with in certain situations. So, when I refer to $69 that's what I'm referring too; just the gbp/usd pair that I started out trading. My learning curve is pretty small because I am just transferring the techniques I used for the eur/usd over to the gbp/usd. Unfortunately, I learned through observation that not all the techniques can be used from one currency pair to another which is why certain techniques are better than others on certain currency pairs. Sorry for the confusion.... CT

I've bent the rules slightly and made a few trades on my demo account to see if I could get the system to work. I made 3 trades tonight. Two were shit because I was trying to see which rules I could bend and how far. Typical me I guess Anyway, the last trade was excellent so I'll post it. My demo account's in the red slightly over tonight, but only by six dollars on $3k lol. The trade I'm going to outline is actually a lot closer to this system than the first two I made just fiddling around with the Williams'. The charts are a bit larger than the maximum vertical size here so I'm going to have to link them. I made this trade on August 15th at 11:05pm Eastern Time. I'm using an Alpari demo account. I entered at 1.9865 and took profit at 1.9844 using the Williams' oscillator hook on the M5 as an exit strategy. My stop loss was set higher(1.9878) for testing, but had I been trading live, I would've went with a stop loss at around 1.9875. H1 chart: http://www.tenechelon.com/Trades/Ten...08_2305_H1.jpg As you can see, right before my trade, price had completed a very similar pattern. That's why I ignored the general rule that price should be in the overbought on the M15 Williams' oscillator as you'll see in the next chart. At the time of my trade, the H1 Williams' had just begun turning downward, and the Pound is obviously in a downtrend here. M15 chart: http://www.tenechelon.com/Trades/Ten...8_2305_M15.jpg I didn't bother, you should be able to draw the price channel here with your eyes. Check out the doji reversal at a. After verifying that and the Williams' moving down on the 15, I thought it was looking good for a sell. M5 chart: http://www.tenechelon.com/Trades/Ten...08_2305_M5.jpg You can see my approximate short entry point at a when the williams' hooked from overbought, and where I bought back my short position at the oversold hook highlighted in green on the williams' oscillator. You actually could've ridden this a lot further, down to 1.9820 or 1.9815. I'm not completely comfortable with how price is moving on Cable right now so I was being conservative. Price broke out of the bottom of the channel and then quickly shot through the roof of it after that so this trade was pretty well timed I think. I hope this helps a few of you asking for charts, cheers.

Hello oeagrus, That's pretty cool! A picture is worth a thousand of words. I glad you are trying The Tenno system for yourself. Thanks for posting the charts.

Oeagrus, That's what you have to do man. You have to test to see what YOU want out of the market and what works for YOU. As soon as you can see the light then it's all green from there man. Well, time for me to open up the old trading station and let the bells rings my friend. Talk to you guys after I finish trading... CT

Hello Everyone, I placed a sell @ 1.9879 (8:20a.m. candle eastern time) when the market was overbrought and a bearish engulfing candle was in the making. My take profit hit @ 1.9869. Thanks and God Bless May I add on another note: While I was writing this I saw a sell opportunity on the 12:45 am candle was a shooting star and market was overbrought, Sidus Method SHOWS DOWNTREND. I sold at 1.9868 and take profit hit at 1.9858. Another +10 PIPS it took about 6 minutes WOW, that was amazing. Total of +20 PIPS Today!!! YAYYAYYY God Bless and Happy trading i have to go to sleep now because I have to wake up for work in the morning. Everyone stay positive and if someone types something you disagree with that has nothing to with learning to trade please keep it to yourself. I know I'm here to learn and not for reading post about who's lying or not. I appreciate that and I say it with a open heart. Have a BLESS day.

Awesome, I'm glad somebody, around here, understands what I've been saying all along..hehe Anyway, I'm happy that you're doing well with your trades. It's easy when you keep it simple. Talk to you later... CT

Gang, Well, it happened so fast, I'm even surprised by this one. At 12:15am Central or 1:15am Eastern, the market created a hammer with the william % below 20%. That was a signal to buy no matter what! So, I jumped into the market at 1.9849 level and got out at 1.9862 level which is a resistence level. That whole trade lasted 7 minutes and I got 9 full profitable pips out of that trade. It wasn't exactly my 10 that I wanted, but it was what the market was willing to give to me so I took it with a smile and no complaints. So, today, my whole trading day lasted from 12am to 12:35am; a whopping 35 minutes of looking at the market while being in the market for less than 8 minutes. I traded 4 lots on this trade and made $36 which isn't much, but the bigger picture is that in the next 5 months, I'll be making over $1,000 on the exact same timeframe, with the exact same market moves, but with more lots. And, the prospect of making $1,000 a day or so is motivation enough for me to be disciplined enough to not do anything foolish... Not to shabby.... Talk to you guys tomarrow, CT

Jog, So, when are you going to come out with your new and improved system man? Ohhhhh....I was just wondering... Time to get some shut eye(sleep that is)... CT

Should this be 80%? or is my setup incorrect? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hello Mcmep11, I just think CurrencyTrader had a lil misprint. I can understand after winning a trade you are so excited you can't type sometimes. But yes he meant 80%. Thanks for mentioning that just in case someone felt confused like a newbie or anyone who's not familiar with Wiliams Indicator. I hope your trading is going good! . CurrencyTrader good job with your trade. God Bless and Happy Trading everyone.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I'm very excited and can't wait to see it. I see you asked if you should sell your system? My answer will of course be no! LOL, but it's up to you. You should let us trade it and see how it goes before you do that. LOL, have a great day!!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
MC, Yeah, my fault bud...it should be 80%... But, next time, if I get mixed up and I say 80% when it should be 20% then know that the market was either at 80% or above or 20% or lower. I'll never take a trade if the market is under 80% or above 20%... CT

I'm here to learn too. Jogjatrader has been the only one to give any valuable information. The rest of the posts are "HAPPY FEEL GOOD" and that doesn't hold any water. I'll be here long after you leave this thread. Good trading.

Hi Jokja... Glad to see another piphunter from Indo I just wonder can this Method apply for Index such as Hanseng or Nikkei? Or somebody here know system which suitable for Index Thanks alot

Not ALL the posts in the thread are like that. We haven't all drank the Kool Aid yet. I'm just testing this out. No system is infallible. It seems like another decent framework for a personalized short-term swing trading strategy. That's all.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Tdion, I would like to apologize to you. I was just having a bad day at work when I post above and I'm really sorry for that was not my character. I hope you are having a blessed day and continue to have successful tradings. I just logged into my broker acct to hunt for a good signal. Have a great night and talk to everyone later. God Bless and Happy trading Awesome

Not all the posts are that way, but the 99% that are nothing but tall tales and methane gas give the other 1% a bad name. Jogjatrader may have had a decent system. We'll never know. His thread got turned into a clown act before we could find out.

B4, Many years ago, I traded the Index called S&amp;P 500 Index. It was a beautiful index to trade and still is for those who want to be part of the stock market traders. But, as I learned more about the currency market, I got away from the stock market and began to learn the eur/usd. But, to make a long story short, there are some similar movements in the S&amp;P 500 Index that are in the currency market. No matter what market you're in; no matter if it's pork bellies, corn, rice, gasoline, silver, gold, or the eur/usd, they all have one thing in common. They all have turning points and wave formations; and they can all be profited from. Nice to see another person from Indonesia CT

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Im Hurt! Im Crushed! And here I thought I was maintaining a healthy degree of scepticism! kidding! no really they may express their enthusiasm differently than the rest, but take it for what it is, they are excited and passionate about a system that works for them. JOG I am still looking forward to your manual! keep up the good work

Folks, If your on the dumb money side, then just consider the fact that I just stole your money, or better yet, professionally pick pocketed you...hehe O.k, all jokes aside, seriously, the trade was easy tonight because the market said where it was going to go. At 1:05am Eastern Time a Doji formation candle formed and the william % was over 80%. The next candle was a down candle which is confirmation of a sell. I sold on a small retrace at 1.9786 level and road the market down 1.9757 level for 27 full pips profit. I wanted to end the weekend with a bang and that's exactly what I did. In this case it took me 55 minutes of being in the market to get that, but it's all good to me. I knew where the market was going. Just imagine me, with a face of Michael Jordan, but the complexion of Tiger Woods smiling at the dumb money and just slapping ya up side your head and taking the dumb money at the same time All jokes aside, for those who couldn't see what was coming and where the market was telling you to trade, as a fellow trader, I would highly advice you to study past charts very..very hard this weekend and see where you could have improved yourself. On the other hand, for those who made money, I would like to say that trading can be easy if you let it be easy and not get complicated. The thing about trading is that you're trading all the accumulations of past 'learned' failures so that the present trade only represents what you've actually learned. Well, time to get some sleep. And, of course, there's going to be lots of playing this weekend. To all, have a safe and happy weekend. I won't be online until Sunday night. Happy Trading, CT

Folks, This is the 3rd time this week where the market made a significant lopside large move. Once again, this happens 2 to 3 times per week and for those who understand the true forces of the market, you can clean house on these types of trades. It just so happens that I like to keep my timeframe short, to the point, and get out quickly. But, for those with the long patience quotient, you can tear the market apart... CT

Hi CT Nice to meet U. Thanks 4 The Info, I've been trading currency for awhile. A Friend of mine suggested to look at the Index as well. He said more attractive than Forex. So who knows more profitable with Index. But I've no idea Which system with fit for Index. Can Tenno System apply to Index as well Cheers

--- 帖子 #229 ---
B4, You're wasting your time on this thread if you want to learn anything about trading. This thread is a joke that's been hi-jacked by a clown. The original system was dubious. The claims that the system suffered no losses were nonsense and the rules were vague and constantly changing. Both should be red flags to anyone. Here is a good thread and a good system: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=40325 Here is another good system: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=14630 There are others here too. For index trading, this is probably the best free forum: http://www.elitetrader.com/

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Guy/gals, Well, last week was fun and this week should be another great week to learn more about yourself through the market and how you trade it. Whatever 'system' that you're trying to use, make sure that you make it your own. I don't think that it's so much the system as it is the trader. There are certain movements that happens every single day in the gbp/usd pair and most people, because of the system that they're trying to trade, are not catching on to what works. I've taken Jogjatrader's system and only took one thing from it and that's the William % overbought and oversold levels. THAT'S IT! If I were starting over again, I would not trade a 'system'. I would see what works, daily, for that system, and take that part of the system for myself and combine it with real world obersvations of what works in the market. But, as it is, a system will not work for 100% of everyone who tries it. That's why the currency market has a 98% failure rate with 'retail traders' because people make the mistake of taking a system, without making it there own, and using it as though they were the actual creatures. When Jogjatrader decides to come out with his improved system, I will look at it and take out what works for ME and I'll NOT use the rest of it; that's if I take anything out of the system at all, since I'm batting a 100% hitting rate of 10 pips daily with the way I'm trading the market now. Well folks, let's keep our heads up and move forward on our accounts... CT

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi CT, Did you catch the move @ 0335, doji and 20%.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Naw...I don't trade before 1am EST(or midnight central time). So, whatever happens before that I really don't pay attention to..unless of course the market zooms up at midnight, then I pay attention... CT

--- 帖子 #233 ---
pat, What pair are you trading? I'm thinking that we're not trading the same pair...I could be mistaken.. CT

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi CT, I am watching GBP/USD 5min. Just watching and try to feel the market with Tenno system and to see what you see. You've your nitch in GBP/USD. I see how you get your 10 pips because when GBP pulls back, it tends to give back 10-15 pips, and if you can catch the begining of the pullback, you will have 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Patrick, Pullbacks or retracements is the best way to trade the market man.... For example...at 1am EST I saw a retracement coming off of an uptrend that was already in the making before the London session even opened. I then saw the pullback and pulled the trigger at confirmation at 1.9816 level and exited my trade at 1.9828 for an 8 pip profit; although I could have stayed in and got my full 10 pips... Some days, I'll get 15 pips and other days only 8, but either way, I know that I'll double my account every month no matter what, as long as I get 5 pips per day. But, since I'm averaging more than that per day, I'm not complaining... CT

--- 帖子 #236 ---
folks, hammer just formed at 1.9861 with william above 80%... the question is, what are you going to do about it? It's a nobrainer.... CT

--- 帖子 #237 ---
folks, Pay attention and profit..it's easy.. I just got out/exit at 1.9850 level for 6 pips profit and now I have a total of 6 pips plus the previous 8 pips profit for a total of 14 pips for the day and I'm finished... Happy Trading and I'll talk to you guys tomarrow, but without the commentary.. I just thought I would do that this one time to see if any of you guys are on the same thought process I'm on. Well, have a great trading night... CT

--- 帖子 #238 ---
CT, The entry @ 1.9816 was based on pullback to EMA not on William%. Right?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Pat, On this trade, I didn't pay attention to the ema being hit because once you get used to trading pullbacks, you won't need an ema to look at. It's all about the story that the candlesticks are telling you. Once you understand the story your comprehension will dramatically improve.... So, for me, since I don't use ema's anymore, other than to just play around with, I don't concentrate on whether the market hits them or not. God is in the smallest of details when it comes to trading off of candlesticks... CT

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Jog, When are you going to come out with the system man? CT

--- 帖子 #242 ---
CT, YOU DA MAN, if you've held on a bit longer, you got your 10 pips. I see your process and thinking. It's imagines how it's pullback to 10-15 pips.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi CT I really have something i have to ask you ... you said that you already trading forex almost 10 years now, why you always asking jogjatrader to release his new system? is your "system" not working right now?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I think he is a little confused about how long he have been trading himself. It is not always easy, even for himself to remember what he have posted earlier you know.... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=199 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=499

jogjatrader has vanished since "cracking" the GBP/USD. He was already hitting 100% winners. This could raise it to 150%. It boggles the mind. I think his announcement was the cause of the erratic behavior of the Pound recently. Let's all hope he is safe. What he has done will not sit well with the world financial community and the central banks. Hurry back, jogja.

Hey Bill, don't put the mockers on this thread, I enjoy it so much. Beats watching the comedians on TV anyday. I'm eagerly awaiting a reply to bapho's and arctic's posts!

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Bapho, Have you not been paying attention to what I wrote? Even now, I still study the market and look for different angles to the market. I'm always interested in a different angle and how somebody else may see the market. How I trade the market fits me perfectly. If someone says that they are going to release a 'system' I'm going to bug them until they do..hehe It has nothing to do with MY system and how I trade the market. If there is something that I see within Jogjatrader's system, that I think will give me a greater appreciation of the market and is usable for my personality, I'll take it and use it. Mind you, it may not be the whole system. It may only be one tiny piece of information I take away from the whole system. Like the William % for example. That small little technique fitted my personality. So, I took what worked and am using it now. That's how the game is played; take what works for YOU and use it for YOU... Take care, CT

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Arc, If you could trade as well as being able to do enough 'research' to find quotes that people wrote in the past, your trading account might be doing better. My advice is for you to start spending more time on doing research to better your trading ability in the market, instead of wasting it trying to prove somebody elses past quotes. Once again, you're failing to understand, that what I wrote pertained to a particular currency pair. It's a little confusing on how I write it sometimes and the perceptions coming from what I write could be twisted to make it look like something that I really didn't mean for people to perceive to begin with. That's my fault. But, I want you to start doing research on how to trade the market better instead of wasting your time finding quotes on people. When you get serious, come holla at yo boy(me)... CT

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Bill, I don't think he vanished homey... I see him on this thread all the time; mainly when you're not on this thread. I corresponded with him via private mail. So, he's around. Maybe if you come back on, during the european session, you might catch him when he's on the board and can ask him yourself where his system is at, while he is actually on the board... As for myself, I like the idea of vanishing. It makes no difference to me, since I'm probably taking your money in the market; that's if you're either trading the eur/usd or the gbp/usd because I trade both. And, with all the negative attitude that you are displaying on this thread, I highly doubt you're making any money in the market; besides 'wanting' to make money in the market. But, hey, I won't complain cause your sentiments don't affect my bank account. I'll just keep taking your money along with all the other 'dumb money' in the market and spend it in my own community. To me, that's a good turnover ratio..hehe CT

You're right, Acko. This is free. The Three Stooges and Benny Hill require a cable subscription. I'm just afraid the guys with the white coats and butterfly nets are going to bring it to an end. Let's hope he can out run them on his bicycle when they come to get him.

MC, I'm glad somebody around here see's the light besides me, and few other people who are trading the market well. This is one of the reasons why I don't waste my time explaining myself or arguing over small matter that don't help my bank account(trading account). Arguing is really a waste of time and money since nothing good ever comes out of any argument besides wasted time. So, from now on MC, I won't even as much as respond to criticism, disbelief, or 'harrassment. I agree with you. I think it all just needs to drop. And, for those who are persistent with there negative attitudes, I think that those people should be ignored to the utmost without even as much as a thought... CT

Folks, Well, tonight was an exceptional night for me. I went way past my 10 pips tonight. If you guys didn't notice, from 1:25am - 1:35am a morning star formed and this formation was above the 80% William with ease. I sold at 1.9878 level and just got out at 1.9829 level for a whopping 45 pips profit! I stayed in for a longer than normal time period because I saw where the trend was headed for the most part. And, the reason why I got out at that particular level was because it formed a hammer at a support level; although it could go down more. I didn't want to be too curious to find out though..hehe Well, that trade took me 45 minutes which isn't too bad for me tonight. My whole work load was only one hour and 29 minutes and that's if you count me typing this message.. Have a good night everyone...I'm outta here.. CT

Hi CT, Good trade, I saw that and thinking it was not at the most high so did not take it. I got a few pips on retracement(demo).

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Patrick, Just finished doing more research on hawaii and the internet structure of the islands. Man, most of the island of Oahu is just one big WiFi hotspot man; truly amazing! Anyway.... Whenever you see a morning star or a hammer and they occur above 80% or below 20% take that trade man, get you're 10 pips or whatnot, and then get out; until you get used to seeing the same thing happen over and over again. Also, on the usd/jpy, the market formed a hammer below the 20% William range and that was good for at least 10 pips, then the market, on the same pair dipped down and created a "bearish 3 method" pattern which was good for another 10+ pips. I mean, damn, this is so easy until it's a sin... Well, at my residence I have secure wireless(so nobody else can pick it up). A friend of mine is trading right along side of me. He traded 30 mini lots this morning(european session) and scored big time with 40 pips for $1,200 profit in 45 minutes. He was so excited he was shaking. Damn, he couldn't even type correctly to log off his labtop because he was so damn nervous.. ...I had to get him out of my condo because he was sweating all over my 2 inch thick rug man..hehe But, now he knows that it can be done... He also understands, now by experience, that all he needs is one trade a week to double his money every 8 weeks... CT

Has anyone tried Tenno on the AUD/USD with positive results? It would be nice if it does since Aussie pips are worth more than double the Cable.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Cham, since the aud/$ is one of the major currency pairs, I can almost bet you that the tenno system, with special emphasis on William %, would be a great pair to trade. What you probably should do is sit back, for a week, and test the tenno on it...Then, BAM, get 5-10 pips daily and go to bed each night happy CT

Hey CC. when you talking about morning star or a hammer above 80% or below 20%, for which time frame? 1 min, 5 min and 15 min? or for all 3? thanks

hx, I only trade the 5 minute chart. So, whenever I speak about 20% and 80% and the different patterns, I'm referring to the 5 minute chart only. But, make no mistake, these patterns can occur on ALL time frames. It all depends on what time frame you can see yourself trading on... CT

hx, I'll answer your question after this trade I'm in.. Can you guys see the signal that I'm seeing now? I'll answer in a bit....hold up.. CT

Folks, If it got any easier to make money on this trade, even my momma would want me to slap her... Even though I got 8 pips total profit, I'm not mad, I'm only glad... If you guys missed it, I want you to go back and take a deep breath and look before the plunge happened! At 1:35am EST time, the market went up and closed, while the William % was over 80% for sure. The very next candle was a "Dark Cloud" candle; a candle in which it closed 50% or more on the body of the previous candle. That was a sell signal folks!!! I sold on a tiny retracement at 1.9833 level and got out at 1.9822 level for an 8 pip profit. That movement took 20 minutes or so and I've been watching the market now for one hour and 11 minutes, including typing this message. To answer your question: "which EMA do you use to determine the trend and have you ever trade against the trend?" I don't use any ema on the gbp/usd. The reason why I don't is because I watch what the previous support/resistence level was, BEFORE the actual sell/buy signal. Once I get the sell or buy signal, I automatically know where to get out at. For example, I knew that the support level was 1.9821 level when the sell signal appeared(Dark Cloud candle) and so that's the area where I got out at. It wasn't an area that would have given me my 10 pips, but it was an area that gave me at least 5 pips so that I could at least fulfill my daily quota... CT

--- 帖子 #267 ---
hx, Yes, I often trade against the trend, because I'm only going for 5-10 pips every single day. So, it doesn't matter what the trend is; especially for the gbp/usd because it's so volatile. I make volatility my friend because even on a retracement, the market moves 10-25 total pips. So, it's all good... CT

--- 帖子 #268 ---
can you see the signal that I'm looking at now? ct

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi CT, I just got 10 pips on GBP/USD at top with a doji and 80%. It works well on 5M.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Folks, This is the second trade of the day and was another easy one... At 2:20 EST(1:20am my time..central time), the market formed a hammer and the william was at exactly 80%...but guess what? The next candle, which is the confirmation candle didn't confirm the down move! So, patience was in order... At 2:25am EST, there was another hammer with a william over 80% was in order, and guess what? The next candle didn't confirm the down movement! More patience... At 2:35am EST, a doji formed and the william was over 80% for sure. On a doji, when overbought, I automatically trade, no matter what! I sold at 1.9853 and exited, just a few minutes ago, at 1.9837 level(which was a support level by the way) for a 12 pip profit, in addition to my original 8 pips for a grand total of 20 full pips for the night.... My total working time for this trade was 10 minutes and total time looking at market is now one hour and 53 minutes for the night... Folks, if you missed this trade, learn from it and move on. I believe I said this before, but for those of you who missed it I'll say it again. The 'dumb money' who looses in this market is at about the 98% range; meaning that 98% of everyone who DID NOT trade lost money; and 98% who did take this trade lost money because they DID NOT KNOW WHEN TO GET THE HELL OUT! The bottom is so crowded. There's more room at the top... Have a great night; time for me to get some shut eye CT

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Patrick, Did you see how easy it was? There was actually two good trades tonight, if a person was aware of what to look for. Your profits are in direct proportion to your knowledge of the force... Good job, once again my friend. Have a great night! CT

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I am new to this thread but it looks like a good system. I have a question though for the ones who are most experienced with this system. If we see that williams is oversold on 5m, 15m , 1hr we go long whether the market is trending or not? if williams is overbought on 5m, 15m, 1hr we go short whether market is trending or not? Is that how this strategy works? Thanks, CS

--- 帖子 #273 ---
CT, You are so right about the turning point and the force. Let the trend begins and people jump in, and we wait and wait when they jump off, that when we pick up our 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
trader, if all 3 time frames are overbought, i can guarantee you that there will be a trend established. you trade what is in the front of you.. buy dips...sell rallies... ct

--- 帖子 #275 ---
So you need to wait for another candle for conformation and then if confirmed, we entered. About the european session, is it at the early session (before lunch time in europe) ? thx CT

--- 帖子 #276 ---
CT is trading a different method than that which was taught at the beginning of the thread. He's trading candlestick patterns at S/R using the Williams' %R as cross-verification. When trading candlestick patterns like Hammers, it's a good idea to wait for a confirming candle afterwards. He's trading a discretionary system, not really a mechanical one.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
set up now on gbp, 3 time frames

--- 帖子 #278 ---
wow, do I actually get this system now? just got +8

--- 帖子 #279 ---
could have been more , i just had tp at 8. sorry for short posts, am driving to work

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Aristo, Yes, when you see a hammer and then the william is sitting at 20% or lower and/or 80% or higher, always wait for next candle to confirm movement before taking the plunge or upswing.. CT

--- 帖子 #281 ---
O, Yes, it's a method based on my experience with a small puff of smoke from Jogjatrader's William % idea. My trading is certainly live my friend. I hate the high and dry kind of trading. It needs to be very personal to me... Did you get in a trade today? CT

--- 帖子 #282 ---
mc, Good job! As long as you can get at least 5 pips daily, you're certainly on your way. There's an opportunity every day, with the exception of Non-Farm Payroll day. I leave that day alone and just go play outside.. CT

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I made one trade that went against me. I can't stay up past about 12am Eastern due to work and the GBP/USD was pretty dead from about 8pm-12am. I went to the gym at some point in there so I was only watching for 2 hours or so. I didn't really get any good signals except a failed doji reversal.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
O, The secret to trading the gbp/usd is to trade it when the volume is the highest and when the biggest banks in the world is trading it also. For example, the top 140 biggest banks in the world are located in London(central base location), so it's only common sense that the biggest banks in the world are going to be trading during the london session. Also, keep in mind that London is the central location for the currency market. No other spot in the world has a bigger influence than the london session. NONE!! Keeping this in mind will help you, as well as others, when it comes to TIMING your trade. The absolute best time to trade is from 12am central/ 1am Eastern to 3am central/4am eastern. If a person can not get 5-10 pips in during that time, something is truly wrong; seriously wrong.... Until next session, CT

--- 帖子 #285 ---
so If I understand this method, there is another setup on all 3 time frames right now for 10 pips on a short position. All Agree?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
ok made 7 on that one, seemed a little more risky as I was trading against the short term trend, but I will continue to trade and post as I can so I can get feedback so I can improve my understanding.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
mc I don't follow all 3 time frames; only the 5 minute chart for me. I come in from a different set of experiences. But, it doesn't mean that looking at all 3 time frames is wrong. It can't be wrong if your getting 5-10 pips a day trading in that manner. And, at the end, that's all that matters my friend.... CT

--- 帖子 #288 ---
looks like another setup like the others that I have taken. 3 time frames agree, still in an upward trend, but will take it anyway probably shooting for 5-8 pips. Short at 1.9957. we shall see what happens

--- 帖子 #289 ---
For now I want to learn the original strategy, then I will work on adding (learning) candlestick patterns. The less I have to remember the better! :-)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
ok, closed position, chickened out at 9950, that upward trend was too strong so didn't want to wait for more. Plus it took so long to realize profit I became unsure. Still a winner though, So I am at 22 pips now, just on 3 trades, doing it in the spare moments in between work, family and pinewood derbies. Ill keep watching.

Guys/Gals(I know there's some woman on here), By the way, before I forget, from now on whenever I type in a time, it will be in Eastern standard time... O.k, so, it was a tricky trade for me, but it didn't have to be! Here's why... At 1:05am EST the market gave off a hammer. So, what do you do when you see a hammer? Correct, be patient and look for the next candle to confirm up or down movement. But, hold up, the next candle at 1:10am was a 'hangman' !!! So, with a combination like that, what do you do? Correct again, you wait for the next candle to confirm. Well, guess what, the next candle confirmed a down movement. So, after the next candle closed, and confirmed a downmovement, you could have sold mkt if you wish at 1.9948 level and gone for 10 pips and could have taken 5 to 6 pips total profit. This was the first oppt. for those aware of these truths... The second oppt? At 1:20am EST the mkt went down and the William was sitting below 20%. O.k, so this is our first clue that the market is oversold, once again. At 1:25am the market formed a hammer! Bingo, another clue. So, what do we do with a hammer? Correct, wait for confirmation to occur. But, guess what, at 1:30am market went up and due to the combination of the previous 2 candles, along with this 1:30am candle going up, guess what that forms? Oh yeah baby...it forms the famous 'morning star' candle formation and that tells a story. It tells me that the market is going to give me at least 10 pips from the close of that very last candle, which was at 1.9951 level. Well, guess what, I bought market at 1.9951 level and the market went to 1.9965(actually the high, as I type this message was 1.9967) and I got my 10 pips and now I'm out of the market. My total time looking at the market has now been 1 hour and 12 minutes and the time I was actually in the market was 30 minutes to get that 10 pips... Not a bad night and mind you, there were two opportunities to get your 5-10 pips for the night. The more you are aware of the forces of the market, the more awareness you'll have of what the market is offering you.... Have a great night everyone, I'm outta here.... CT

--- 帖子 #294 ---
CT, Yeah, another 10 pips. Love it.

Pat, Good job dude. This, of course, can be done daily, except for non-farm payroll day which is a dangerous day to trade during the european session. Like I said before, there is ALWAYS a buy or sell signal between 1am EST and 4am EST...ALWAYS!! ct

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Aristo, By the time I announce what I have done, it will be too late to get into a trade from the very beginning; unless the trend is fantastically strong in one direction. On the other hand, by me saying what my thought process was, I am hoping that you guys can pick up on that and make it your own; personalize it. CT

Trader, I found a site for you that I think is a good site to learn candlestick trading. Of course, there's free sites by searching google.com, but the site below has 3 or 4 different reversal points that you should take note of. http://www.candlestickwarrior.com/download1.html CT

took a buy on the 3 time frames aggreeing, 2.1126, lets see what happens.

that was I meant dude. In that way, we or at least me can learn how choose a signal aristo

that was quick, closed at 2.0035 for 9 pips profit. not bad!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I saw a signal at 4.10 GMT and follow buy a bullish candle, the williams is below 80%, It's a buy signal at 5m Chart aristo

--- 帖子 #304 ---
for anyone learning, look at my time stamp and compare it to your timezone, and your brokers charts, to see exactly when I took the trade. Now if you look back at the 1hr chart it wont seem to be under the 80, but momentarily it was- so you do have to be watching for these opportunities. When you get a quick move like we just had, that line drops down fast but comes back up fast so the 1hr chart may not show it later.

if you said that morning star is a bullish reversal pattern,, then my mistake,, that's what i found too,, i already bought GU at the opening candle 4.20 GMT,, but not a straight up market,, , i am still holding it, try to get the TP at 2.0045 aristo

folks, it's been 40 minutes now, and that's a little too long for my taste to be in the market for 10 pips. I'll give in 5 or 10 more minutes to make an up move. if it doesn't make a move up, I'll get out on an even basis, or a small 2 or 3 pip loss... ct

last candle was oversold, so if mkt closes at or above 2.0029 then that will either be a piercing candle which is bullish or an engulfing candle which is still bullish.. If this happens, I'll stay in the market... ct

market, on last candle closed at 2.0029 which is a piercing candle which represents bullish sentiment in the mkt.. I'll stay in and see what happens now.. ct

All, At 2:10 east time, all time frame 5, 15, 1hr are below 20%. According to Tenno system, this is what we are looking for. If all turn up, will be nice.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
gang, Well, the signal was there for sure, but understanding the time frame that it normally takes for me to get my pips is another story. I knew, after 40 minutes of being in the mkt, that something was wrong. So, I stayed in for 15 more minutes and went ahead and got out with a 2 pip loss... I'll catch the next signal... ct

--- 帖子 #324 ---
gang, look at what just happened; a perfect doji at oversold levels with william below 20%...go figure..hehe ct

--- 帖子 #325 ---
..

--- 帖子 #326 ---
pat, news is coming out at 4:30 est and that could push the market up even more... ct

--- 帖子 #327 ---
folks, the previous doji was followed by a hangman candle and the next candle after the hangman was a down candle in the formation of a hammer, but the hammer was not oversold on the william, so, I sold mkt at 2.0004 and got out at 1.0094 for a full 6 pips profit minus my original -2 pip loss, which is 4 pips profit.. Not pretty, but a profitable day for me.. ct

--- 帖子 #328 ---
gang, Remember when I said that 2 to 3 times a week, the market makes a lopsided move to one side or the other. Well, today is one of those day, and I jump back into the market at 1.9998 level on a sell and just jumped back out at 1.9984 for a full 10 pips profit, plus the additional 4 pips from the previous trade, which is 14 pips for the day for me. Well, that's it for me. Once you specialize in one currency pair and know it inside out, you'll just know what to do; not based on your feelings, but based on what has always worked... Time to get some shut eye for the night... CT

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Took a buy signal, at 1.9993. I think this is the tail end of patricks signal. hesitant on this one because it is London open, 4hr down candle, but will take it anyway, but I am setting a tp and going to bed, catch ya all tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
For those who didn't profit.... The reason why I sold the market and changed from 'dumb money' to 'smart money' is because at 2:20am EST the market gave a perfect doji and the william % was below 20%. So, that would have made you thought that the market was going up. But, what I always wait for is a confirming candle that tells me if that doji is correct. Well, at 2:30am the market formed a down candle but it was a hangman candle. So, what do you do on that? Yep, you wait for the next candle for confirmation. Well, the next candle was confirmation down candle, BUT it was a hammer. BUT, the hammer was not below 20% william so, I sold at the close of that candle! Conclusively, even though the market was oversold big time, you have to wait for confirming candles in order to see if what the market wants to do is actually going to really do it. The slight mistake I made at the beginning was that I looked at the previous 'morning star reversal'!! It was a slight mistake because the european mkt was not even in session when that formed! When that morning star reversal formed, it did what it was suppose to do, but the problem was, was that it formed at the end of the asian session and not DURING the european session. So, I got excited a little bit too fast and was too hasty to make a trade. But, once you understand the pair your trading, you can adjust small mistakes like that and just go on doing what you would have normally done if you didn't get excited at all. Even now, I get excited and make small mistakes, but I correct them really fast.... Happy trading, CT

Patrick, All those little clues behind those candlesticks was telling me that the market would go up. And, I said that the market would go up after news came out after 3:30am and now the market, as I type this, is at 2.0134 which is a huge jump in price action... If a person would have been ultra patient, they could have scored big time. That's where Tenno's system comes in... CT

Folks, Before taking leave for this extended weekend, due to the U.K Bank holiday on Monday, I wanted to say something real fast for those who don't want to or can't be up for the european session. I have found that when there is 2 or more important news items that comes out at 8:30am EST, for the U.S session, there is always a trade that can be taken. You will always get somewhere between 1 to 4 trades during the week, if you stick with the U.S session and trade the gbp/usd. For example, there was only one trade this week, for the U.S session where you could have traded the gbp/usd based on news items coming out at 8:30am EST time. Today, Friday, was that day. Had you traded during the U.S session, like I did this morning(I traded because I wanted to end the weekend with a massive bang), you could of had two trades in this morning before 12:30pm EST. The first trade occured after the news came out at 8:30am EST. What happened was what would happen during the european session. The market went up and up..then at 9am EST a 'doji' formed. The doji was way over 80% william and that was the first clue. Now, I was looking for a second candle to confirm a potential down movement. Lo and behold, the next candle was a down candle. BINGO! I waited for a small retracement and I sold market at 2.0097 level and got out at 2.0083 level which is a FULL 10 pip profitable trade. So, at this point my total profits is now 24 pips for the day. The second trade occured at 11am when that candle caused the william to jump below 20%. Well, the next candle was a 'hammer'. So, what do you do, when you see a hammer? You wait for the next candle to convince you of where the market is going. The next candle was in up candle and it caused a 3 candle 'morning star reversal' to take affect. I saw that and just knew where the market was headed. I bought on a small retracement at 2.0088 level. Although the market went 12 pips against me, I knew where it was headed for sure. So, without all the drama and excitement I stayed in the market. I wound up exiting the market at 2.0102 level for 10 full beautiful pips and would up with 34 pips for the day trading both sessions. And, as you guys know, the market went up a hell of alot further than 10 stankin pips..hehe By the way, I got 5 hours of sleep between the european session and the U.S session before I traded the U.S session. Have a great long weekend, CT

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Pips, What time frame are you trading from? I ask because instead of waiting for a 'correction' you could have already had at least 25 pips from the recent upmove. I personally have no clue if the market will gap next week. It could very well gap, then head straight south from the gapping point; who knows. I specialize in knowing the behavior of the gbp/usd on the 5 minute chart only. But, there are people who do specialize in the 1 hr or 4 hr chart so your question would probably be appropriate for that crowd... CT

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Folks, I'll stay up for 2 hour, from midnight to 2am central time, to watch the market and if there's an opportunity, I'll trade. And, if not, then it'll be a short night anyway... Let's see what happens... ct

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi CT, Let see if we can pick up first 10 pips of the week. Have you traded larger timeframe before?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Pat, During my days of trading the commodities market and the S&amp;P 500 Index, I've always traded the 1-minute chart. But, instead of trading the 1-minute chart for the currency market, the biggest time frame I felt 'the most comfortable' with was the 5-minute timeframe. I've tested the larger timeframes; from 15-minutes to 4-hr charts and they are just too slow for me and give out less signals. I'm looking for 5-10 pips daily and sometimes the 15-minute chart, less alone the larger ones, don't give out a signal every signal day. So, I stick with the 5-minute chart. By the way, at 12am sharp, the market formed a 'morning star reversal' and I picked up 3 quick pips. The reason why I only got 3 was because it's a holiday in the u.k and alot of traders, especially the real movers(banks) are not trading the market. CT

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Pat, I think I mentioned this before, but I'll do it again... When I first got started with trading the currency market, I was pushing a few pips per day for the eur/usd. Then, I discovered the gbp/usd for myself due to the fact that I wanted more 'volatility' in my trading the way I was used to having it for the S&amp;P 500 Index. So, I did some simple calculations and came to the conclusion that if the most conservative of all conservative traders only got 5 pips every other trading day; they could still double there account every 8 weeks(every 2 months) without a problem. That's only trading Monday, Wenesday, and Friday(with the exception of non-farm payroll day for the european session). Pat, this does NOT include those days where there 3 or more news items, at 7:30am central time(8:30am EST) for the U.S session. This is soooo conservative until a moron could get 5 stinkin pips every other day. I figure if a person started out with $100 and doubled it every 2 months, or every 8 weeks, in 24 months, that person could have a $400,000+ trading account in 2 years. Go figure how simple that would be to attain my friend.... CT

--- 帖子 #346 ---
folks, the 10 pip level, off the morning star reversal at 12am central/1am est was just hit at 2.0159 level... Sometimes I just want to kick myself. But, I'll give myself an excuse this time because of the u.k holiday.... ct

--- 帖子 #347 ---
CT, So you are trading most of your setups before news? or 04 -08 GMT

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Pat, man(laughing)...u.k holiday or not, the market moves regardless!! Patrick, 100% of the time I trade before any news comes out; with the exception of the U.S session which has a different personality. On that session, I ALWAYS wait until there's 3 or more news items that comes out at 7:30am Central time before trading that session. I've only traded that session a few times and have gotten my 5-10 pips every time. Hmmm....but I'm too lazy to do it consistently..hehe ct

--- 帖子 #349 ---
CT, Man, some of the morning star and evening star of 5 min chart real kick a$$.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Patrick, My friend, who trades next to me made a quick $600 in less than 15 minutes when he saw that morning star reversal man. Simple..simple...and more simple... It's the easiest money he's every made in his life. He's been keeping records and according to his records, he hasn't spent over 55 minutes in the market for any profit he's made. So far, he's 37 for 37 trade for trade. He now knows whats possible. He's going to be quitting his full time job, which only pays $400 a week, tomarrow! He told me, before he left, that he'll walk into his bosses office, tell him he's quitting, and show his boss his profit sheet from his trading account so that his boss can see that he just made more money in 15 minutes than what he makes at his job in a single two week period for all the 15 minutes added up... It's a damn good feeling to do that too.... ct

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Patrick, I told you that the morning star reversal literally guarantees 10 pips profit every single time it happens. I just didn't think that it would happen during the U.K bank holiday since banks are not trading the market today. But, hell high waters, mate, now that I know better I will do better.... ct

How much capital that your friend put for this kind of trading, so he can generate $600 ?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Aristo, I'm not sure how much capital he puts up. All I see is the profit he made by taking a quick glance at his Day P/L(profit loss)... ct

I saw a bearish engulfing at 6.05 GMT and the william is aboe -20, a signal for sell. I did enter. But the price is still consolidating. I hope it will go down, Just waiting for a long bearish candle.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Aristo, Between 2:15am &amp; 2:25am Eastern time, there was another 'morning star reversal' setup that was above 80% for a sell my friend. It was inevidable what that meant, once you became aware of what the market was saying.... I sold mkt on a small retrace to 2.0178 level and just got out at 2.0172 for a small 2 pip profit. I only took 2 pips because first and formost, I already had 3 pips before this trade and all I wanted was 5 pips for the night. Secondly, I took only 2 pips profit because it's 2:08am as I type this message and I don't want to be in the market past 2am at NO POINT. So, I'll take my 5 pips and call it a night my friend. I'll holla at you and the rest of the gang tomarrow.... CT

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Guys/gals, If you see a morning star and then see that the market is consolidating for 30 to 40 minutes after the morning star was pronounced(like this european session), my advice is to get the hell out of the market and take a small loss(the market may very well go down but I don't trust consolidations after morning star reversal formations due to the fact that the market could go against your account too much before seeing any real profit), because you'll have another oppt during the night to get that small loss back plus 5-10 pips profit on the top of that... happy trading, ct

--- 帖子 #358 ---
so you are not considering williams ??

--- 帖子 #359 ---
CT, You are so right about it. Because we are trading against the trend, and if we don't get 10 pips within 15-30 mins, the trend may continue.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
CT can you post a pic of the morning star you saw this morning? It was on 5min or 15min?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Aristo, I always look at the oversold/overbought levels on the William. But, like I said, there's 2 to 3 times per week when the market just goes lopsided in one direction or the other and the william doesn't help much. When you get used to seeing the lopsidedness, you'll understand more about what I'm talking about... ct

--- 帖子 #362 ---
i think today is not a good day for GU.... at 11.00 ET GU just make 67 pips in range and heading south....

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Dropesparky, Go back and look at the time between 2:15am &amp; 2:25am Eastern time or 1:15am &amp; 1:25am Central time and you'll see the 3 candle formation that forms the morning star reversal. You'll also find that the william was at the appropriate level on the first and second candle. If you're not trading on FXCM 's chart, then your chart may have a slight different look. So, if this is the case, then check out another morning star, located at the times between 3:30am &amp; 3:40am EST/ or 2:30am &amp; 2:40am Central. It's a 3 candle formation that is just absolutely astonishing my friend....just astonishing. The thing about it is that on the very first morning star reversal, the market went 10 pips against that position, but like always, morning start will guarantee a minimum of 10 full pips profit; not including the spread, so it would be 14 pip movement.. I don't post pics of charts online because not all charts look the same. I have found that some charts have a slight difference in price and as a result the outcome of a reversal may be a bit different. CT

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Pips, The morning star reversal said what the story was going to be early in the european session today my friend. As a result, you have witnessed one of those lopsided days and it just so happens that the market headed straight south... A good day for the GU depends on what side of the market you're on my friend. If you're on the correct side, every day can be a good day, but knowing when to get out is another story... CT

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Pat, did you see the lopsided down movement today? During the european session, there was actually two whole 'morning star reversals' that told the story about where the market was going and the move was just that much more powerful due to TWO morning star reversals. When that happens, WATCH OUT!! CT

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Currencytrader! thank you for your posting... I got a lot information from you. Can you reccomend me a web site with explaining of candles patterns? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Forward, Too much info isn't good for anyone if you don't put it into immediate use. Man, you know what? I hate reading books. Seriously, I do. But, you know what? That's not necessarily a bad thing. The human mind can only absorb so much information at a time and the human mind only retains less than 10% of what it absorbs. You'll never use every piece of information you read about, and you sure as hell won't retain anywhere close to all the info you read. But, what I do, is read the things that counts the most and use it IMMEDIATELY! Now days, unlike my high school and college day, I read less and less and watch more and more movies.. When I was in high school and college, I read 5 newspapers a day and hundreds of books through my college years. But, NO MORE! I have learned that reading less, and only reading the things that counts, which can be used and applied immediately are the only things that count. I know this because I know alot of college professors and PH'D's who are dead broke and could not make enough money to get themselves out of a wet paper bag. They are knowledge smart, but 95% of it is useless when it comes to making money. So, what does all this mean for you and me? Well, I gave someone else, on this site, a website that I will give to you... http://www.candlestickwarrior.com/download1.html The free charts you'll find on the first page are some of the candlestick patterns I use to trade the gbp/usd. As you become better and better at trading the gbp/usd you'll see certain patterns happen over and over and over again, and you'll get so excited you'll wound up wanting to trade the U.S session also! For the morning star reversal signal go to this site: http://www.candlestickforum.com/article_morn_star.html This is a good example of what a morning star reversal looks like. Happy trading, CT

Thank you currencytrader. I agree with you, and I'm trying to catch an essence of this method. As I understood, you are using only 5m timeframe and your general rules: williams levels and candles paterns? is it right?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Forward, Time gave you a good reference point. Anyways, yes, I only trade the 5 minute chart. I don't look at the 1min. chart, or 10 min chart, or 1 hr chart for any kind of confirmation. But, I've been trading on the 5 min. chart for years and years and know every creek and turn in the market. It's like reading the same story over and over again and then being able to memorize, verbatim, what the story is going to say and the turning points in the story itself. It takes looking at hundreds and hundreds of different situations, but once done, there's no turning back buddy.... CT

Folks, I just found a forex broker in Switzerland. One of the advantages of opening up an account, starting with $2,000, is that there's No capital gains tax on profits even if you're based in the United States. Damn, I may have to switch from FXCM to ACM, located at: http://www.ac-markets.com/ Everyone here knows that I plan on moving to Hawaii and hawaii has the highest taxes in the united states. But, by moving my funds over to ACM and not paying any capital gains taxes, because this company is based in Switzerland, I could be saving myself 30% on my income every year! Hmmmm..... CT

Folks, Did you see what I saw? Between 12:45am and 12:55am central, the market gave a perfect 'morning star reversal. Plus the William was over 80% for a sell signal. I sold mkt at 2.0067 and just got out at 2.0053 for 10 quick pips in about 15 minutes... Not bad at all. Since it's still early, I'll wait for another signal and then call it a night.. ct

Hi CT, That is interesting. How good is ACM? How long have they been in business?

Well gang, I'm out of the market and exited when it went back up to 51 level; actually the 2.0055 level and broke dead even on the second trade. So, I still have my original 10 pips and am happy about that.. Time to get some shut eye for the night cause it's 2am Central time and I don't trade over 2 hours or watch the market past two hours per night. Talk to you guys tomarrow night... CT

--- 帖子 #381 ---
it is clearly that GU is heading south from Europe open till now

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Pat &amp; Aristo, Remember back when the market gave a 3 bar combination of a "star reversal" from 1:20am - 1:30am Central and I said that the market was going up? Well, the market did go against that position 25 pips. But, I also said that the market would go up. My friend just called me and got me on my cell phone and told me that the market just hit 2.0065 level which is the 10 pip level from that morning star reversal. Personally, had I stayed in I would have had 20 pips during the european session, but it's no big deal. I'll catch 10 more pips tomarrow during the session... It just goes to show you that the 'morning star reversal' never lies. It may be a tad bit late sometimes and will test your patience level, but it always fulfills it promise. And, tonight was no different; except the amount of patience level you needed to get through the dumb money for the night... Now, I have to take time to get back to sleep. I think I'll change my cell phone number..hehe CT

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hey gang, Just passing through and did some analogy about how often the morning star reversal actually occurs. Out of the last 27 trading days, 12 of those days could have been traded due to watching for the morning star reversal signal! I have found that 100% of the time, the 'morning star reversal' occurs between 12am &amp; 2am Central time(or 1am EST and 3am EST time). That means that every 5 weeks, if you just had specialized in trading the 'morning star reversal' and nothing else, you could have doubled your account in 5 weeks. I imagine that you could do this every 5 to 6 weeks and in two years have your account flying like an eagle. Specialize in one trading technique and then add other techniques as you become a master of the one technique that you're specializing in. There will be 2 and 3 days, sometimes, where you will not trade at all because the morning star reversal just doesn't occur. So what, live on. CT

--- 帖子 #384 ---
well, 5 to 6 weeks in two years?? you will need to be very consistent, full of dicipline, not to get bored easily

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi CT... yes you are right.... but i closed my position already.... because i'm afraid on fomc... thx for your signal... regards,

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi CT, Just got my 11 pips on the pulled back.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Aristo, Yesp, consistentency is what you want. It's possible to trade every single day, be conservative(5-6 pips total profit), and come out a real winner every day, every week, and every month. And, you're right, there's a large amount of discipline that must be taken into consideration. And, as long as I'm making money, I'll never get bored..hehe ct

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Pips, Don't worry about it. Just stay focused and get your 10 pips the next day then. There's always a tomarrow... CT

--- 帖子 #389 ---
pat, Good, I just logged into my trading platform and saw that pullback. There's going to be another opportunity, or two, during the european session. So, I'll just wait until then... CT

--- 帖子 #390 ---
All, I noticed if we got the confirmation and patiently wait for the small retracement and got in. If price goes in our favor, the 10 pips is really fast.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
pat, Yeah, that's how it works. Those retracements are valuable because retracements show you where people are loosing money as well as were the winners are taking there profits and selling there positions to the loosers(if mkt is trending up). It's pretty simple once you get your visual learning down pat... ct

--- 帖子 #392 ---
folks, keep your eye opened to an opportunity that could show up here pretty quickly... ct

coming up after a morning reversal signal at 6.00 GMT on 5 min Chart GU, the price is going up

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi CT, Yeah another 16 pips. 61.8%, spin, 20%, and around 06-07 GMT, what a setup.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Folks, I don't know which one is easier; making 10 full profitable pips, or sitting back and laughing all the way to the bank Listen up, it was an easy night that only lasted for about 20 minutes. At 1:55am central time, there was a hammer and the william was well below 20%. I bought market at 1.9998 level. At 2am sharp the market formed another hammer that was well below 20% william; which was double trouble for the dumb money who was on the downside! I exited my trade at 2.0012 level for 10 full pips for the night and it took me 20 minutes to get that. I have now been looking at the market for one hour and 26 minutes. I'm now 43 for 43 with the gbp/usd with NO losses. I have traded every day, with the exception of non-farm payroll day european session in which I take those days off. The hammer, during this session, said it all and you just have to pull the damn trigger and forget about your fears... Have a great night and I'll talk to you guys tomarrow CT

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Patrick, The most common setups are the ones that include the spinners, hammers, and morning star reversals. These are the most common for the gbp/usd. It may very well be alot different for the eur/usd since it's a different personality of a pair... CT

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Aristo, did you make a good profit yet? ct

--- 帖子 #398 ---
CT, How did you come up with 10 pips for GBP? The market just took back the 10 pips if we did not exit.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Patrick At 1:55am central/2:55am EST the markt formed a hammer and the william was below 20%. I bought market at 1.9998 level bro... I exited my trade at 2.0012 level for 10 full pips... ct

--- 帖子 #400 ---
CT, What I mean is 10 pips taking pips so fit with GBP 5 mins.

Yes, i did,, I took this trade get in buy at 2.0008 and T/P at 2.0019

--- 帖子 #402 ---
patrick, It was an easy trade. I always trade the 5 minute chart and nothing else. There were actually two hammers, side by side that formed during the previous time frame I just told you about and both were under 20% william man. One hammer, like I said before, occured at 1:55am central and the other formed at 2am central/3am est and both were less than 20% william range. It was so easy... ct

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Pat, What I mean when I say 10 full pips is when the market moves 14 pips, but due to spread of 4 pips, I only get 10 pips profit... But, the market has to move 14 pips before I get my full 10 pips profit.. ct

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Folks, Well, have a great night...it's 2am central time, and it's time for me to get to bed... talk to you guys later.. ct

pip warrior, One thing about trading is that we traders have all got something in common. We all want to profit... One reason why I am moving to Hawaii next month is because I will be able to trade from 7pm-9pm instead of 12am-2am like I'm doing now. In hawaii, I'll be able to trade right before bedtime, but after supper time, and still be in bed and wake up at 6am or 7am every morning. It'll be a wonderful setup for me... ct

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Gang, I decided, today, to go ahead and trade the U.S session. I wanted to see if I would see the same signals that I see, nightly, during the european session. I also wanted to see if there would be a signal within the first two hours of the U.S market between 6am-8am central time or 7am-9am Eastern time. Well, I did and took advantage of it. At 6am central/7am EST the market gave one of the best hammers you could possibly imagine. I sold market at 2.0135 and exited the market at 2.0121 level for 10 full pips. The trade lasted me less than 15 minutes. That was pretty early during the session, so I thought I would wait to see if there would be another trade within the hour. Well, lo and behold, at 6:45am central time or 7:45am Eastern time, the market gave out a perfect doji and the william was well below 20%. So, I bought market at 2.0109 and exited at 2.0123 level for 10 more pips. That trade took me 10 minutes to accomplish. Overall, I made 30 pips today trading two session. I don't trade the U.S session that much, but I decided to do it today because I had nothing else scheduled for the morning. I love trading, but I'm not motivated enough to trade two session; since my only motivation is to get 5-10 pips per day. But, sometimes, I do get impulsive and wound up getting alot more than that... CT

Folks, I just told you, and I'm not sure how much easier it can get, a few minutes ago to watch out for an upcoming opportunity because the market was heating up. Well, guess what? At 12:05am CT/1:05am EST the market gave off a perfect 'doji' and the william % was well below 20%. So, what do you do? You buy of course. I mean, how much easier can it get? I bought mkt at 2.0128 and exited a few minutes ago at 2.0142 for 10 pips! It took less than 5 minutes to get that. I'll wait for one more opportunity and then call it a night... CT

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Pat, Not only are the big boys, like Bank of America(who averages over $800 million a year in profits) are doing what we are doing; but there are mutual funds and hedge funds companies out there that are buying and selling a billion dollars by the minute my friend. This market is so vast and deep until you cannot possibly comprehend it all. And, even if you could, one person, no matter how many lots they bought or sold in one clipping, could NOT move this market one single pip! CT

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I've just joined this forum and I've been going through the tenno system from jogjatrader. Yes, it works. And like CT said, it's all about your trading style. Whether the system works for you, you are the only one who decide it. I've made my 20 pips from short position at 2.0178 when William showed above 20. Looking at the candlestick, I know when to exit my position. My compliment for jogjatrader who shared his idea. I just adapt it to my trading style... CT, keep on posting man... There are lots of good things happen when someone share their experiences, whether it's good or bad.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Guys, I don't know what to say or how to say it simpler... After that initial blast to the upside and then the market coming down(retracement), I saw two hammers form, that were not below or above 20% or 80% william, but those hammers truly represented a sentiment to NOT continue to the downside since they were part of a retracement. I knew this small detail and because of this I went ahead and bought market at 2.0148 and exited at 2.0162 for a full 10 pips. This trade took less than 5 minutes and was a tricky trade if you don't have a good grasp of the knowledge of the force of the market. Anyone, who has been trading for years could see this uptrend once the retracement was over with and the market began to climb back up. How much further will it go up? I have no clue. All I know is that I got my 10 pips, I was on the correct side of the market, and the dumb money went home cryin to momma... Well, that's it for me folks; 20 pips and a good night sleep is the doctors order... Talk to you guys tomarrow... CT

--- 帖子 #418 ---
free, So far, I'm 46 for 46 for 10 or more pips every single day bro with the exception of not trading on the day of Non-Farm Payroll. There's no luck in that, no matter what! Luck is understanding an opportunity and then pulling the trigger to get the end result(profit). I'm glad you're using jogjatrader as a guide to better your trading account. Have a great night, CT

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Folks, I decided to go ahead and place a sell at 2.0142 for two simple reasons; First, the market was consolidating going into Londson session. Secondly, at 12:40am central/1:40am EST a 'hangman' formed at 20% William exactly WHILE the market was consolidating. When this happens, folks, you must sell. I did so at 2.0142 and exited at 2.0132 for 6 pips profit. That trade took less than 5 minutes to get me 6 pips. Now, I could quit for the night, and my whole trading day would have lasted less than 5 minutes, but I won't. I'll wait for another opportunity. By the way, my 'homeboy' placed the same trade for 90 mini lots, scored 6 pips(with a limit order for taking profit) and just made a whopping $540 in less than 5 minutes... CT

--- 帖子 #426 ---
it sure is inevitable.. ct

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Folks, Once again, nature doesn't lie. At 1:15am CT/2:15am EST the market gave off a 'hammer' and the william percentage was at 20%. In addition to this, you have 3 completely beautiful 'doji's' that are side by side. Buy was the only thing on my mind; and it should have been on your mind too! So, I bought at 2.0130 and set my limit for taking profit at 2.0144.. Just now, the market took me out and gave me my 10 full pips. Now, I have 16 pips for the european session. This trade took me less than 20 minutes and my whole trading night was 40 minutes of looking at the market. I mean, how easier can it get folks, when the market is banging the signal in the front of your face. I made over $200 tonight(trading the gbp/usd) in less than 30 minutes total time. My friend made a little over $1400 during this same time period with the same currency pair. Needless to say, he's a happy camper and is about to pack up and leave. He has to give the boss some bad news about his, uh....permanent disappearance act, from his job, that he's about to display..hehe Well, that's it for me. I'm taking a long weekend vacation because Monday is Labor day. Well, hope everyone scores at least 5 pips during the session. I'll talk to you guys either on monday or tuesday's trading session... Have a great weekend yall... CT

Danish, I was just wondering about something. Are you from Denmark? I ask, because I used to date a beautiful blonde headed young lady who is from Copenhagen, Denmark. Her name is/was Malena Jensen. She kept telling me that she loved me; in her native language. The only thing I can now remember is her voice telling me this: "Yi elska di" or something close to this; meaning I love you. So, if you know of a Malena Jensen, please get her on this board, cause I still love that woman...hehe CT

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Pip, My best advice for being scare due to major news items coming out, or when Bernanke speaks is to just have more patience than normal and DO NOT TRADE! Matter of fact, if you're trading more than once per day, you're trading too much! Trading twice per day should be the absolute maximum amount of times a person should trade per day; and that's if you're absolutely sure where the market will be headed after you initiate your trade. Well, keep pippin my man... Ct

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Patrick It is scary when you're not used to winning very often. And, it's sure as hell is scary when making money is simple while 98% of everyone else is actually loosing money. But, once you become aware of the fact that YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY instead of thinking that making money in the market is abnormal, then that's when it all hits you, like a ton of bricks, that this trading thing should be simple and not very complicatd at all... People make it complicated by doing all the wrong things and following all the latest fads and trends on 'how to trade the market', when in reality, trading the market is a function of price action followed by retracements...

Gang, Even though monday is labor day, the european session will be tradeable, and you can bet your dog and cat that I'll be trading the session on monday morning european session. So, I'll talk to you guys monday morning.. CT

Well I was a little sceptical at first,,,, but 46 / 46 , The score is on the board !!!!! Congrats and good luck.

hey currencyTrader, Thank you very much for posting your trades. This has helped me klike you don't even know. I have a couple of questions: 1. It seems to me that you only look at the 5m chart with williams%R. Do you use any of the original poster's (jogjatrader) indicators? This person had about 6 EMAs running across 3 different time frames. 2. As I followed some of your last posts/trades, my charts didn't really match up. I'm using MT4 with interbankFX. I believe its the different platforms. I know you're moving to the islands, but if you could continue to post as you trade I would be grateful. Take note that I'm on the East coast; I stuggle at times to stay up at the "sweet spot" time for the euro session. thanks, HJJ

John.. John, I'm glad you're trying to become a better investor and trader. And, really, the best part about trading is that you have to understand YOU. It all begins with YOU and not the investment vehicle that you're trying to profit from. Some people love the eur/usd, others the gbp/usd and still others the gbp/jpy. O.k, as far as me, like I keep saying, I ONLY trade off the 5 minute chart. I use NO OTHER CHART TIMES. I use the William %, which is one of Jogjatraders' original indicators. Like I said, like a broken record, I come into the market with a different set of experiences. What and how I explain things may or may not match up with YOUR perceptions of the market. That's the hard part. But, one thing will NEVER change. And, that is candlestick formations which tells the real story. If you're looking for 'doji' formation, 'hammer' formations, 'hangman' formations, 'morning star reversals' formations, or any combination of these four together, and the market is either below 20% or above 80% on the William, then it's a trade no matter what! It doesn't matter what trading platform you're trading from. These candlestick formations happen on ALL platforms and you have to become aware and visually learn how and what they look like for the platform that you're trading from. Hope this helps some... CT

--- 帖子 #441 ---
CT?-Anybody? heard from Jogjatrader? Seems like he just vanished. He said he was going to have some 'extras'.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Dun, when I logged on to answer John's question, I saw that Jogjatrader was also logged on. So, he's on here and was just probably checking his thread to see the posts. He and I email each other and he's a very busy person. He runs a language school and has a wife and one daughter. So, he's busy enough. Maybe he'll post when he creates more time to do so. If he's too busy to post during the week, maybe he can post on the weekend or something. But, I promise you he's anything but dead..hehe CT

guys, be prepared for a good move to form due to this consolidation that we're now witnessing. I have already sold mkt at 2.0164 level and due to already scoring 30 pips from the gbp/jpy asian session, I will have a 10 pip stop loss at 2.0174 level so it's not a big deal to me. But, the market could go down... CT

--- 帖子 #444 ---
folks, Even if I loose on this small trade, I'll still have 20 pips profit for the day; so no matter what, I'll be profitable for the day. Let's see what happens.. CT

--- 帖子 #445 ---
gang, I had a small 2 pip loss at the 2.0162 level due to a minor support area that was hit. I'll take that small loss and now I have 28 pips for the day profit as a total... No big deal and no sweat off of my eyebrow. Don't try what I just did at home because it's a dangerous trade. Consolidations can be good for you if you already have a good amount of pips already from the market. But, don't try to trade a consolidation without any backup pips for you to rely on because the market can go either way on a consolidation... CT

--- 帖子 #446 ---
folks, get ready for a trade because the market just heated up to the upside and it will soon give a good signal for some profits... be prepared... ct

Hi CT, I've already enter short at 2.0180 tp 2.0170 . Still learning .... but I think the market is still confuse where to go ... right? Mike

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Mike and everyone else, At 2am central time/3am EST the market gave off a doji after the big upcandle which closed below 20% william. The next candle was a 'hangman' followed by another 'hangman' !! At 2:20am CT/ 3:20 EST there was an 'up' confirmation candle stating that the market still has room to go up. You have to see the market for what it is trying to tell you. Based on those 3 candlesticks and the confirmation candle and what they truly mean, the market could still go up folks.. I bought at 2.0181 and am about to get out of the market now around 2.0199 level or whatever level I hit the button at when I end this message.. CT

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Folks, Watch what the market is telling you and DON'T go with your so called gut feeling. I just exited at 2.0201 level. Remember, I bought market at 2.0181 level folks and just exited for a whopping 16 pip profit. I'm done for the night and my overall profits for both the asian session(I traded the gbp/jpy) and the european session(gbp/usd) is 28 pips + 16 pips= 42 pips for the day. I'm not complaining.... The market started consolidating at 12:50am ct/1:50am EST and I knew the market would go one way or the other. At 1:25am CT the market jumped up and I knew that it could continue up but waited to get out of the market with a small 2 pip loss. I acted quickly after the market heated up to the upsided and saw the candlesticks that told me that the market was headed higher and I acted on what the market was telling me. Sometimes, visual learning is more difficult than mental learning, but once you get that out of the way, when it comes to real world trading, it's all ice cream and cake. Now, for those on the dumb money side, I want you to see what the market was trying to tell you with those candlesticks. It's all very simple once you get your visual learning down. Well, time to get some shuteye folks. It's been a great day for me, but a terrible day for the dumb money who went home crying to momma with a bag of ice on both eyes from the black-eye affect O.k, all jokes aside; learn from whatever mistakes you just made and correct it tomarrow during european session. Have a great night, CT

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Pat, How did you do in the market? By the time you see this message, I'll be logged off, but I'll chat with you tomarrow man. Everyone, have a great night. And, most of all, learn from your mistakes and don't make the same mistakes twice.. I'm outta here.. CT

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi CT, I got lucky the market didn't went up ahead and retrace back ... still got that 10 pips ... pheeww ... I still have to learn read the candlestick ... Good luck to all of you and happy trading mike

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Mike, Well, I'm glad you got 10 pips. But, I want you to keep concentrating on learning to read candlesticks for the Gbp/usd currency pair. I don't want you to keep 'getting lucky' because luck is going to run out at some point and all you'll have left is your ability to trade the market or your ability to not trade the market. That's why I want you to keep working on getting rid of luck and gaining visual learning experience through observation and real time trading. I'm fluent in 3 currency pairs; the gbp/usd, the eur/usd, and the gbp/jpy. I know what candles work in those particular currency pairs. I can read them like a book. But, I do want to congratulate you on those 10 pips. Good going... CT

Hey yall, Well, I have my one way plane ticket in hand and will be leaving for hawaii this week instead of next week. After tonights trading, I'll take the rest of the week off to get my house items sold off as well as shutting off my utilities this week and paying some bills before leaving. I will not be trading for about two weeks. I'll trade tonight, but after tonight I will be offline until next friday. I will take the rest of this week off. My plane leaves on Friday and it's a 13 hour plane ride. I'll use next week to just play around and familiarize myself with my surroundings. Then I'll get back to trading on the 17th of September which is a Monday. I've scored enough pips in the past 6 weeks, from the gbp/usd alone, to not worry about trading for 2 weeks. So, let's make it a good one tonight so that I can leave everyone on a good note. I want to see people making 5-10 pips tonight... CT

Pips, Just make sure to go over every post I have written and then go back and do a history test to see if you can identify setups that would have been profitable for you.

Hello. I dont want to spoil all the fun and hapiness here, and dont want to seem disrespectfull, but i cannot see the efectiveness of this system, maybe it may be improved as well. All the charts posted indicate orders on the price extremes, based on supposed change of trends in williams @ indicator, some on multiple TF. However, i found that in all of them williams indicator is trending in the opposite direction as it is supposed to be trending. Only AFTER the closing of the supposed candle the williams is shifting. watch the charts , please. on the multiple TF example it would means that after the closing of the supposed candle ( opening of the next immediate candle ) i would have an entry signal on lower TF and no entry signal on bigger tf. Correct me please if im wrong. thanks,

--- 帖子 #482 ---
hi 3cent... maybe CT can give his comment after he is back.... because... CT usually used that indicator and post his comment here in this thread.... we communicate each other to achieve our goal to get 10 pips per day... so.. i can not give any comment about your post... regards,

Folks, I'm in hawaii now but my computer is still on central standard time. I will leave it that way so that I know EXACTLY when to trade the market. This will also allow my computer to automatically switch to daylight savings time when the time comes again since hawaii has no such thing as daylight savings time in there time zone. Well, Pips Warrior, if you would have looked at the market and traded it based on what the candles were telling you, you would have never had a loss. Quit guessing where the market is going to go or at what price level it is going to reverse at. That's not your job. You're job is to do what the market tells you to do in the 'here and now' moment. Look for 'morning star reversals' at the 20% and 80% William level, hammers with confirmation candle at the 20% and 80% level, among the other reversal signals that I have been writing about. I've got to go, but just wanted to post quickly. I won't be back online until next Monday. peace &amp; Aloha CT

Guys, I got 12 emails in my private box about doing private consultation and some questions. Before taking the two week vacation, I analyzed which currency pair gave me the most pips within a 20 day trading period for the last two months. By far, I must admit, the most profitable currency pair for me to trade is the GBP/JPY because of the volatility. The gbp/usd and the eur/usd simply can't compare to the movement and volatility of the pound/yen(gbp/jpy). While I was making 10 pips daily on the gbp/usd and averaging around 5 pips daily while I was trading the eur/usd, I was making 25-60 pips per day(with the exception of trading on NON-FARM Payroll Day) on the gbp/jpy. The second reason why I am in hawaii is because I am making so much money on the gbp/jpy. I am pulling in over 150 pips weekly on the gbp/jpy alone. Honestly, I was trading both the gbp/usd and the gbp/jpy at the same time because I have 3 plasma monitor screens. You guys know what I have written and you can go back into the archives and see what I've written to learn from what I was speaking about when it comes to trading candles on the gbp/usd. So, there's no reason or excuse for not learning how to trading using candlesticks with confirmation from the William percentage. This post is my last post because I have taken on two promising young african american traders who are from my town of New Orleans, Louisiana, that have proven that they both have gifts of patience and the gift of visual learning. So, I will stop posting on this board and I will train them for 3 full months; no more no less. I have taken on these two individuals and after them I won't be training another person until I find a good woman, get married and have my own children. My children, and perhaps my future wife, if she's interested, will be the only people that I will teach to become rich in this business. I'll keep it in the bloodline the way King David and Solomon kept there wealth, and wealth of information, within there bloodlines(hehe.. ). So, I just wanted to say, good luck and if you want to really do well in the market, you need to understand the force of the market. This is my last post and the last time I'll be visiting this board due to other priorities I now have. Time to disconnect... CT

Will you start a new thread so we will not get confused between this one and the new one?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi everyone, thanks for that system, I think it works fine. I've tested it for couple of days and here are some trades based on that system. where i can find v.2?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hello Jogjatrader, or somebody uses that system, I'm sorry, my English is not exellent (I'm from Hungary, Budapest, middle -east Europe). Please tell me again the stop place of this system. It isn't so clear for me. Jogjatrader wrote, stop is above/under the daily valley/peak 5 pips. I think sometimes it is too big. Please send a chart, and sign stop on it. Currencytrader said, he never uses stop and he lost max. 2-3 pips/trade. It seems too small. What do you think and use, dear Users? Thank you: Sunflower

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi, I'm trying that system since 15.01.08. I'm happy of results. If you stick to the rules you can get easy 10pips per trade or you could move your stop every e.g. 15 pips and trying to catch beginning of the trend. Stop loss should be 5-10 pips above or below last higher or lower price. If the SL i to far away for you, don't trade and wait for another signal. I'm trying to look at the charts before Frankfurt and London open because they usually create the trend for the rest of the day. Since 0600 to 1400 (then comes mostly US news and signals could be failed). I'm GMT+1. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hello Magictrader, Thank you very much for your fast answer. Yes you helped me. My SL was in wrong place today and I lost 20 dollar. (To tell the throuth 1h chart didn't give a good sign, inspite of this I traded.) This is too much for me, because on my subaccount has 450 USD. I use all this ammount for one trade, so when I catch 10 pip/day I am very happy, it is very good for me. More than 2 %/day it isnt bad. I like this system, and I try to use it more efficiently. If you have more charts, please show me/us. Thanks again: Sunflower

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi, I use also basic technical analysis to know where potential points of reversal could be (pivot points, fibonacci, trend lines, etc.) and wait for the confirmation. Then is strong reason why price should return. We have to be very carefull when we miss the entry point and the strong trend will begin. This system "catches" the tops and the bottoms and if there is a strong trend we could be out and don't get even 10pips, so be aware of that. The positive is that the every trend has some beginning and we can catch it using that system. There's one thing I don't know why, sometimes on different platforms (I've got demo account using MetaTrader, and real acc using DealBook360) the %R looks different. In one platform e.g it points down, and on the other it points up. The price in both platfors is the same and setup for indicator also. Here are some historical charts:

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Here is today's trade: We've got some resistance at 1,9904, some fibs and sell signal. Entry was to late but 10 pips gained.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Here is today's live entry: 10 pips in 10 minutes (I've modified my exit point, firts it was on 15pips gain).

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hello Magictrader, I tried this system other pairs too, and it worked, but I closed the trade only 3-5 pip plus. Thank for new charts, but the second isn't so clear for me. When You trade GBP/USD whith tenno do You use a big part of your account? (My borker company: OANDA , and I trading on its platform.) Sunflower

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi, I use about 5% of my account (because I lost in first 2 months about 40%). I've change little bit rules of TP. If that system works fine in better then 50% so TP = SL + spread. Then risk/reward = 1 and it should be profitable in long term. Today I've also try on another pairs like USD/CHF and I gain profit. Because other major pairs has less volatility SL could be about 5-7 pips from top or bottom. Now when I pull the trigger I'll setup my SL and TP, setup alarms on that price levels, and turn off my monitor. The market and I have the same chances, but I think that TP will be hit more times then SL. Just like today. Patience is the key. Magictrader P.S what is not so clear, on which chart?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Here are modified rules about TP on the chart:

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Majictrader Thanks for posting your charts and bringing this thread back to life. I will be trading this strategy live on the eur/jpy. Will let you know how things are going in a week or so. Don't know what has happened to the new version.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Here's today's first call about 10:10 GMT+1 It hit stop loss (SL was 10 pips from last min. price, the market goes 3 pips below that level). Second call (few minutes later) was better and it was possible to gain all the pips which was lose in the first trade. Sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Today's London open 0900 GMT+1 and first signal. 10 pips could be gained (yellow circle) but I try on demo strategy with modified TP level. So I was stopped out.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Few minutes later was another signal so I decided to open a position with double lot. And my TP level was hit. So If our aim will be today only 10 pips on each trade it will be gained. But we risk about 20-25 pips (SL 10 pips below last low, or high). One wrong trade and then we should have three good trades to have some profit. It's very risky.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi, Orientos did you try this strategy on EUR/JPY?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Here are some of todays trades. Very hard day. First was stopped out, second should be stopped, but I don't put my stop loss. At the third signal I sell G/U with few more lots to recover my loss from first trade. And of the day with value of +25pips and some new experience.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I'm still trading with that "system" and it's profitable. I add some kind of filter. It's MACD and Stochastic, it's very good if there are divergences and we've got a signal from %R. It hepls very much and gives more confidence that entry point is correct. Just my 2 cents...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Magic, I'm looking forward to trying out this system. Keep us posted on your changes and your results. Until then I will be using the original rules.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
At the first thought..i say to myself..this system is not for me..too many false signal...i'm just about to ignore this thread..but what CT explain at his last post was opened my eyes...Give a 2nd thought and study the way reversal cs and connect it to the 20% and 80% overbought and oversold William range...Now i can see the beauty of the system...say no more to losses..thanks a lot CT.
