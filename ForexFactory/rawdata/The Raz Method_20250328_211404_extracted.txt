I no longer trade this anymore, all be it did provide an excellent learning experience. thank you, RAZ 2/7/14

As I mentioned before here are 'the guts'. I want to start off by telling you the importance of understanding each of the indicators, not necessarily the exact calculations but a true understanding of what their purposes are. I am not going to do that for you, but before you use them for valid signals I believe it is important for you to understand them. Please do your due diligence and learn the meaning of these indicators. Ok where do I start, so I use MT4 obviously, using the MT4 demo platform from MB Trading, which is my live account broker. I have my mixed feeling about them, but so far I have been fairly treated by MB Trading. Although they offer live accounts for the MT4, I am using their MBT Navigator for placing my trades. I will attach templates at the bottom. I am currently trading the EUR/USD; GBP/USD; USD/CHF; USD/JPY pairs. I will have to be honest each of the currency pairs do behave a little different, and have had good success with the EUR/USD &amp; USD/JPY pairs, as for the GBP/USD and USD/CHF I tend to be a little more careful in making my decisions. I will elaborate as we go on why, but I still stick with my method. Indicators on 30 Min: 3 EMA(close) 20 EMA(close) RSI (8) MACD (12,26,9) ADX(14) If you are manually building these for MT4 or a non MT4 platform, you will have to had permanent horizontal lines on the RSI, at levels of 60;55;50;45;40. You will also have to add a permanent horizontal line on the ADX at 25. On the MACD histogram, I suggest fattening up your histogram, makes it easy to determine market momentum. Also color code your EMA's as well as the lines on the RSI. Indicators on 4Hour: Very simple; 5 EMA(close) 10 EMA(close) 20 EMA(close) Thats it, and yes color different of course. Below you can see, and I have put the templates down below.

oops forgot the templates, see guys I am no computer programmer.

How do you determine when to enter? What do you use for stops/profits ? Thanks, Michael

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Looks interesting, can't wait to see some trades in action.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I am getting to it buddy, I am just a slow typer, and crap speller, so I have to proof read my post everytime.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Sounds interesting. How much you make per trade for both 30min and 4hr? I would prefer 4hr tf cause i work long term. do u use stop loss? Thanks

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Entry &amp; Exits As I more like to call purpose and reasons. I look for the purpose, and use reasons to make or break. So what I am looking for ? For Entry LONG; I first need to be in LONG MODE. How to be in LONG MODE? In other words I look at the 4hr TF and see that the 5 EMA is completely past the 10 EMA and 20 EMA(must be passed both 10 EMA and 20 EMA, CLOSED CONFIRM). Now I currently look for LONGS. If the 5 EMA is passed the 10 EMA but not past the 20 EMA, no long or short entries. In other words the 5 EMA has to completely bypass the 20 EMA to be a valid LONG MODE. You may be asking what is the 10 EMA for? Well that will help determine if the market is ranging and moving sideways. Especially if the 5 EMA is sitting between the 10 EMA and 20 EMA. For Entry SHORT; I think from what is explained above you can easily know what SHORT MODE is. Yes the 5 EMA has to completely past and close confirmed through the 20 EMA. From this I will look for short entries. Below is a pic to illustrate LONG; SHORT; and NOTHING. The red arrows indicate looking for LONGS or SHORTS, from this pic you can clearly see that we were looking for longs through out the whole week.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I haven't got to it yet, but to answer your questions I make 20 to 25 pips per trade, but depending how much of a posistion you are willing to take that will determine how much you make. Unfortanutely I do not make trades off the 4hr TF, and I do work full time also so I do miss out on the 30 min TF, and that is where I make my entry points.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Now that we know when we are in LONG or SHORT MODE , now we flip to the 30 min TF, and this is where the fun begins. In LONG MODE; THE Musts! (I don't know if Musts is a word, but it's sounds cool) I am looking for the 3 EMA to be closed above the 20 EMA, the actual candle itself can close on the lines, but the 3 EMA line has to be above 20 EMA line. Does not have to be fresh cross of the two. First! Whic is the most vital entry signal that I truly look for, this is a definite must. My only true entry signal. I need a close of through the '55' line of the RSI. It can come from the bottom, or bounce down from the top, but it must close at slant through the '55' line. This has to be instant with the most current, or sometimes most current two candles(which I call a connecting candle, I will explain later). This all can better be explained with a pic. Next I look at my ADX, I look for two things, first priorty is how far below or above the 25 line are we, this will indicate strength of a trend. Although if it is below the 25 line, I will still sometimes take the entry. Next I look at the +DI, and see what direction it is going, if I am in LONG MODE then I have to have the green line above the red line to indicate positive direction. This, very much like the MACD(that I am going to explain below) are filters, not signals for valid entries. Lastly the lovely MACD. This and the ADX are purely my filters for my trades, I do not use the MACD to take any signals, just like I don't with the ADX. Keep in mind my only signal taker in trading is the RSI. However with MACD it truly is my main filter. Like I mentioned before, please research what these indicators are and understand their meanings. For the MACD, we all know it is a lagging indicator. However with this method I want to trade with the momentum, not against it. So with MACD, I am looking at the histogram and signal line, and where they came from. I take the last 15 candles, and visualize them. I see to myself the momentum of what direction has been favored recently. So first I look at the histogram, and see the strength of momentum. Must show that it is going bullish(looking for longs). Even if the histogram is below the 0 line, I will still use this for bullish confirmation if there is significant lose in Negative momentum. If the histogram shows very low activity, and seems to hover up and below the 0 line, but still very close to it, then I will probably void my chance of any trade, because this usually indicates range market. Anyways back to LONG MODE, after determining my the histogram favors my direction, I at look the signal line, and where it came from. If the signal line is falling, the most likely it will be a false signal(and I analyse the last 15 candles to justify this). If the signal line is shooting up(looking 15 candles back), then of course this confirms my Long entry, also if the signal line is up but dips a little and now sideways(looking 15 candles back) then I still long. Remember MACD is a lagging indicator. So to recap on Long entry; 3 EMA above 20 EMA RSI most clean break the '55' line. ADX does not have too, but indicate strong trend above or below the 25 line; also looking for green to be above the red. MACD Histogram paints a picture of history, and yes it can confirm + or - momentum. Signal line must be up, or sideways(but recently up) both looking 15 candles back. Enter Long, 25 pip TP with 25 SL. Below are pics that show valid entries, one is a fresh cross of the RSI, and the other is what I call a bounce of the RSI

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Wow! I looked back and realized I may have came up with a recipe on how to make someone fall asleep, I mean I jammed a lot of details out there. I guess the reason for this, is that I wanted to express the details of what make this method work properly. I have read so many methods on this forum, and realize how many of them can simply put the entire method in 100 words or less. This is no disrespect to anyone else's method, and I am pretty sure that a lot of them work for that particular trader. But I truly believe there are so many reasons as to why you take these signals or not. I want everyone to understand the details clearly. Nothing is simple, and if it were simple then we all would be millionaires.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I would recommend compiling this information, along with a variety of image examples when and where they apply into a word document. Otherwise, looks interesting, as said before, can't wait to see some trades in action.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
SHORT MODE; Well can anyone guess? Yes it the exact procedures that follow LONG MODE, but you are now looking for the RSI to break the '45' line. Now in SHORT MODE , these will be valid entries. All though the entry on the second pic shows a rally, but never hit the stop loss, and as you can see momentum took us to our TP.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Yeah I probably should do that, I will later, but now that I have started it this way I might as well finishi it.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
ya, of course, no point in just leaving this half finished, and you'll already have it all written

--- 帖子 #16 ---
THE NEVERS!!!!! This is where discipline is a key to this success. I call this my nevers! Well first of all for a trading plan to work, you must have your own limitations that are not intrepreted right on your monitor, actually it is YOU! Or me, or we! Whatever we call it, this stuff isn't written down, nor is it going to send out a bolt of non deadly lighting at you whenver you break the rules. Because we all know when we break our rules, who is the one to eat it the most? you/me/we! With you, it can be many things, or few things, but with me it's quite simple, because I like simple. First of all my TP is 25 pips, no trailing stop, too small of a TF to make that work. My stop loss is 25 pips. It hasn't changed, and it won't changed. Earlier I mentioned that I make 20 to 25 pips, here is why. I have seen the market reach 23 and even sometimes 24.8 pips before, and yes it has reversed down and stopped me out for a loss. That sucks! However through thick and thin, I will never try and lose any pips that I have earned. So once my trade is active, and it hits 22 pips(which seems to happen all the time) I will manually put a fixed SL at +20 pips. From that point on the market will decide whether I can gracefully have +25 pips or simply just +20 pips. Either way I am happy, and I never lose out on a close TP. So far its about 73% hit the +25 pips and the rest finish out +20 pips. Next is when do I trade, well when I am not at my full time job I try to trade as much as I can, but I will not trade until the EU Market has officially opened for the first of the week. I may miss out on some quick little valid signals, but I wait till the first intial EU open. From that point on I feel that the market will start to shape up of what is going to happen for the week. On the flip side I will not trade the last 18 hours of the market, and yes that includes entire last US Session. I currently live in Arizona, so in otherwords(we are currently Pacific Time Zone, and we don't observe daylight savings which just complicates things even more) I start looking for trades here in Arizona after 11:00pm Sunday night, and stop taking trades Friday around 3:00 to 4:00 am. Holidays, these are very tricky, and are very prone to throwing the market for a spin. So for me to generate any sort of valid entry, I wait for a two complete cycles before I do anything. Remember I need momentum to make good trades. So if there is a Bank Holiday on Monday, I will wait till the EU session has gone through two full opens and closes, then I will start looking for trades. Probably till Wednesday night. I never close my trade out, even if it is sitting on -20 pips. This is where your emotions have to be strong. I never close out my trade for 7 or 13 or 17 + pips, because I believe with all things confirming that it will hit its TP of 20 to 25. Once I am in a trade, I consider it history, and it's accounted for. I do not try and adjust my lot size while I am trading. There are going to be more thing in the future to discuss about what I do and not do, and to what currency pair. I do not know if this will work on other pairs, because I have not tested it on them. If you look back up the list of things that I said I will never do, because of the past all of those 'I nevers' have cost me money. I know this system isn't perfect, and wouldn't expect anyone to take this method and roll 100%, but for me and what I have experienced with it has shown a high success rate of trades. Like I said before knowing when to be ready and sitting right there 100% focused to take the trades at the given time, is truly the toughest challenge. Ok now that I have explained it, please feel free to post whatever questions you may have, and I wouldn't mind answering them for you.

One thing I did not mention earlier about the RSI, is watch out for a valid cross that crosses 3 to 4 lines(on the RSI) in one to two candles, this usually signifies a news signal, and usually retraces. Here is a pic to show what I mean. This rarely happens with valid signals.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Raz, How often do you get a setup just watching the four pairs EU, GU, UJ and UC? Thanks/Harry

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Harry, It can vary, but from what I have experienced I usually get about 3 to 4 Valid signals on EUR/USD per week; and around 3 to 2 on the rest. I know it sounds like a lot of work for just a few trades, but I do remember one week I nailed 11 trades, no losses, and made +248 pips. The most losing trades that I have experienced in a row, was 3. So the way I sum it up, is that I do get very few valid entries, but when I do I have a high chance of success. I hope that answers your question.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
On euro I need to have a close above the 10ema and 20ema for me to look for longs, possible retrace then a bounce up. On the cable I am looking for longs, On the swissy I need a close below the 10ema and 20 ema, for me to look for shorts Yen is trending into the ranging channel, so if there is a close in between the 10ema and 20 ema, I am going to ignore any possible signals.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks for posting your system.......I like because it seems to be high % hit rate, which is what everyone wants........does not matter how many pips you get a trade or day, cuz its the value of the pips which is important...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
so far not much to trade. This week is starting to shape up for some good trades. I will be leaving town for a day, so I will be out of trading however but I will back test the valid signals as I go.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
exactly why stick with this method.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Here in the pic you can see why I did not take this Long position, everything else matched up, but the momentum on the MACD was falling which voided a possible entry. Although this may hit later on, it doesn't qualify for a valid entry.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Of course I am using the MT4 Demo account from MB trading, and like usual it craps out. So always have a back up plan, so I use FXDD Demo MT4. This MT4 from MB Trading has been disconnecting a lot lately, so if this continues to happen I will more then likely use the FXDD demo for now on. Considering the spread effects the PA just a little, it still works for me. So right now using MT4 FXDD

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Well nothing is a sense of indicators is going to change, but over the last three weeks(since MB Trading went live accounts with the MT4) my MT4 Platform has just shut down. Thus leaving me out of good trades, and throwing my signals off. I have been using IBX MT4 for sometime for demo accounting, then switched to MB Trading MT4 when it was demo only. Things were never an issue, however this week I missed out on probably my only true valid signal, simply because the platform pooped out on me on MB Trading. So I have been using FXDD MT4 for the last three weeks for backtesting this last entire year, and have had good results. So basically to change what I earlier spoke about using MT4, because these are 30 min candles, shouldn't have much change in with platform to platform, going forward I am going to use the FXDD MT4 for now on. From what I have heard and read online, it seems widely used and seems quite dependable. Here is a pic of the only valid entry for the start of this week, and yes it did hit it's take profit.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
It's a bummer that I missed it because of platform issues, but a good start for the week. So I hope to show week after week, the success of The Raz Method. So far one trade up.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
This is the first time im ever writing on FF, iv seen N number of system's here come and go, but finally ur is the actual one i like bcz it some what resembles my style of trading.Kudos to you and yur work sir! Now another question for entry now suppose, you 4h charts are in short mode and you do get a properly valid signal on the 30min for a long.. In such cases what do you do?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
That will happen very often, however I stay true with the market trend. So in this case I do not take the entry. Sometimes it will hit, but sometimes it won't so I just dont take that risk. Keep in mind when I trade the market trends with this method; it is almost discribed that the trend itself is already determined, and momentum has already been established. With this method I am looking for openings in an already established trend. So catching it when it starts usually is never the case. But through countless trial and error I have learned is to stay true with the market trend.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
i got your point, waiting to hear more tips from you on this technique! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
In this pic below you can see that you have complete cross of the 3 ema through the 20 ema( I know it is hard to see at first, but it does cross, which makes it valid). But this is would be a valid signal for Short entry, but since we are in long mode I totally disregrad this valid entry.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I had taken a similar trade in Nzd/Usd 2 hours ago same setup, lucky me i closed it at break even hehehe......but then in this euro setup u just showed would we wait for the ADX to come near to 25? or can we take it before also the rsi should be below 45 right....or below 40? some times it touches 45 comes back to 50 also....i get confused in such cases...

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Nice engineered thread; Thank you for organizing it unlike most threads I read. Just took 20 on the Gu using your method of locking in profit once 20 is hit. It made more but 20 is a smart ending... 4h long mode; 30m macd was not a full 15 candles of upward momentum but signal line turned up with increasing size histo bars so I pounced. Thanks for sharing your experience. Forex is a tough business and you have offered a simple solution. I'll be watching this more. Steve

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Well for the ADX it doesnt have to be above or below the 25 line, that just helps you understand the strength of a trade. If you are Shorting then you must see the RSI touch(or be pretty break very very very close and near the ) the 45 line and break down towards the 40 line. If it breaks the 45 line and rallies up towards the 50 then I dont take the trade.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Good catch steve, yes that case I would have used a little discretion and taken the trade. Everything lined up, and as you can see the last 15 candles painted a picture of recent heavy positive momentum, and then you saw it start build back up, and yes the signal line was sideways flat for a sec but sligthly up and it looks like it did hit. Good job

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Not much will probably be happening, but I will be out for work the next 8 hours, but I will document any valid entries when I get back, and hope to grab trade or two tonight.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Well good news and bad news; Bad News: was I had family suddenly visit me today, and took much of my time after work. We went out to eat, and just got back home and quickly logged on only to realize that I missed another valid entry, which did hit its take profit. So that is three signals this week that I have missed via sleep;work;family visits. Good News: is that The Raz Method so far this week is 100% on winning target, and no losers. I did miss three this week, all on the cable, but overall still valid entries that hit their take profits. This pic below shows the valid entry that I was about 1 hour late from getting home too, but it did hit perfectly.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
wat a coincidence lol i missed out on all three signals including the gbp one 2day was like an hour late lol, 4 hour was in long mode and 30 min showed buy and we could have enterd!!! im loving it...... Good system just that you have to be glued 24 hrs if you want to make pips and earn money!!! that the tough part

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Raz, I am confused on this trade. The 4H chart is not CLOSED above 5, 10 and 20 EMAs yet. Do we have to wait for the close before looking for entry on 30M TF?. Thanks/Harry

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Very good question. So I have blown up a picture below to show what I mean of closure of candle. Keep in mind that you are taking the mid of prior candle to the mid of the next candle to indicate closure. Now you bring up a good point, of course the current candle could easily reverse there for sending you to pass up a trade. However that is part of trading, the current candle that you are in(4hr mode) is going to be bouncing up and down, and if you are LONG MODE in which the GBP/USD was, you definetly want to make sure the 5 ema is above the rest while take the trade. So to answer you final question, you do not have to wait for the current 4hr candle to close before taking a trade on the 30 min TF. Maybe I wasn't clear on viewing the 4hr TF before, and I do apologize for that, but I consider the data from the prior mid(candle) to the current mid(candle) as you can see that is how the 5 ema(line itself) plots upto. Hope this makes it clear for you Harry, once again I apologize for not being clear before.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thank you Raz, very clear now..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Live Trade: Short USD/CHF 1.0120 Very close to rsi break, but with in the closure range it was valid to me so I took it. Looking for 25 pips

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Sitting on +11 pips so far, definetly feel it will hit the 25 mark, but its 'slug' to me. I see another possible entry coming up on the cable long. It has a nice jump up, possibly a little strong on RSI, so I will consider and entry a few pips below close. Just gonna have to wait and see how the candle comes to a close.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Live Trade: Long on cable at 1.6415

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Well before I could even post the pics, both trades just closed out +25 pips each!! For the week up +50 pips live trading. However I did miss 3 earlier signals. Weekly Track: 3 winners missed(sleep/work/family visits) 2 winners (cable long and swissy short) 0 losers Would be up 5 trades right now, but I will take these two winners right now.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Sorry I did not get to your post earlier. I had someone recently pm me and say that this system is ridicolous to have to watch the market 24 hr around the clock. Well there is one thing I cannot quite explain about this, however I do have a good idea how to read the charts and realize when I feel that I will probably not get a valid signal for few to couple hours. With this time I go for a hike(there is a mountain right behind my house) or go out to eat. I even went to go see a movie last week in between trades. I understand the feeling when missing a good trade, because believe me I have missed three this week. But reading the 4hr chart and the 30 min TF I can sort of tell that I have an hour or two where I can walk away and have a life outside of Forex trading. It is tough to see this, and maybe some of you will be able to garner this expertise better than I will. So right now is an example where I just had two trades hit +25 pips a piece. And from the looks of it it will probably take at least an hour for anything to brew up. So I am going to take a break away from this, and be back and see what else comes up.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Raz, Thank you for this system.I was about posting the results of those two trading opportunities that you just posted above.I saw them and pounced and the two hit their TPs.That is cool 50pips this morning. Thanks again for the system.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
well good job , I am glad to see that you were willing to give it a try and make +pips off it. I also see that this was your first post. I feel a bit honored to have two people so far post for the first time on forexfactory on this thread. Good luck in your trading ways...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
All signals are showing, but the MACD Signal Line is very bearish. Histo showing recent positive momentum, but its been bouncing up and down on the 0 line, which indicates range.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Going to pass this one up, signal line is too bearish, and on the 4hr TF the PA is moving bearish. So going to leave this one alone

--- 帖子 #51 ---
You been tracking this system for a while nw, so u knw ur thing. mite take me a while but ill get my free times too i waching Usd/Jpy for a entry what do you think? there was a valid entry on Usd/Cad and still going but a little slow compared to the other trades...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I was looking at USD/JPY, however I passed it up because of signal line on MACD was bearish. It did pick from close to about +17 pips(taking spread into consideration). However if it hits... then hits, but I did pass it up. On USD/CAD, I wouldn't know, because I have not tested this system on any other currencies then ones that I previously mentioned. So with that being in mind I hope you are trading a demo account, not a live account with other currency pairs other than eur/usd;gbp/usd;usd/chd;usd;jpy. Well over time I hope you will maybe enlighten me with these other currencies to see if this system does work for them. Careful pairs like the GBP/JPY have major whips, that it can knock your 25 pip stop loss really fast. Good luck

--- 帖子 #53 ---
USD/JPY- well it looks like it would have made at least 20 pips, but I am a low risk trader as you can tell.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Usd/Cad - closed out on +25 pips It does follow the system also .... iv been watching it the whole of this week...n this was the first trade....as for usd/jpy yes i took +20 and im out...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
RAZ: ic your point on Uj just not showing any macd upward slope at the 30m entry to be safe. Also, it was hugging zero line with small bars...not good. Not sure if there was flat macd signal line at entry or not. Since price went up it always looks better in hindsight. I think you might have entered long if macd signal line was flat; however, you might not like the ADX less than 25 either so not too impressive. Did I read this correct? Thanks for a nice method to work with as I learn forex. Steve

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Not to say it wouldn't hit it the +25 pips. But from the ADX and MACD histogram it looks like it will range.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
good job, I will open my trading up for the USD/CAD , but I will demo it instead of live. I have not tested the behavior of this pair, but I am glad you have given me the opportunity to see it work. Thank you Psycic

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Very good point Steve and you read exaclty what I saw. At that time the MACD signal line was pointing down, and the histogram bounced up and down on the zero in conjuction with the yellow line on ADX below 25, so with all that I took no trade. However I believe the best way to read the signals is put your cross hair right over the mid of the candle and this will give you a current view of what you would have saw in the past. Anything to the left of the cross hair is what was currently showing right when it closed. I plotted a dummy crosshair on the chart to show you what I mean.

Live Trade: Short 1.0108

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Definetly going to be a slug on the swissy.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
RAZ: the 30m Uchf histo is very slightly rising. Did its signal line overrule that? How much weight did the ADX below 25 and flat 30m 3ema have? Thanks for helping us so much. Steve

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Well first loser of the week, but it happens.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I should have taken that into play, but I fell recent drop in histogram gave me confirmation, even though it did rise just slightly, signal line was down. Yes the line was below 25 line on ADX, but I took the risk. And yes it was a loser. Will document loss reasons here, but still looking forward. Good job on your analysis.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
sorry for the loss. Your teaching from live trade allows us to see as you see and think in real time. God bless you for helping me. Steve

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Forward testing is the best type of testing. I am currently trading a live account of $400. So if I lose or win its not big either way, but the fact that it is live it gives me better feel for the current opportunities. The thing about losses is that are unavoidable, however with this method I have learned they are very limited. I average about 2 to 3 a week, and about 11 to 13 winners a week. So if I can catch all the signals I will always be positive.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
with a $1,000 risking 2%/trade allows $20 to risk/trade. $20 divided by 25 pip sl=0.8 minilots/trade. Therefore, if you make 200 pips weekly that's $160 using a $1,000 account, or 160% weekly.......... DANG............I see your point

--- 帖子 #67 ---
hey raz cool method you have here ... looking forward to test it what do you think about this chart is this a trade ? thx in advance iT

--- 帖子 #68 ---
This is not a trade, the +di is going down, macd is showing a sell momentum....i wouldnt go for a buy now...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi, I think if u can get 9.10-9.15 then buy. if not, then wait, it is not confirmed yet. my opinion

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Mr Raz. +25 on sell of USD/CHF again confirmed signals...!!!! btw i woudnt have taken the sell you took at that time...adx was not confirming!!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
ok thx, i was not sure about it either please if you can always put in charts so its easier to understand which situation you meant, and its easier to learn from pics thx. iT

--- 帖子 #72 ---
no problem sir nx tiime will upload charts as well!!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Was out for a little bit, thinking I could sleep away a few pips. Here I would definetly agree with Psycic. ADX is pointing down and the histogram is losing momentum. So pass the trade is what I sould have done.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Good job, I did miss this one, took another nap. The one I took was a bit of a weak signal, so I used a little discretion and took it anyways, even though histogram was not confirming at that point. As you can see it hit my stop loss, but went over by just 1 pip, so if I had a little luck it would have gone -24 pips and just head straight south and hit +25 anyways, but its ok I document my losses each time and write down the reasons and move on. Good job on getting it the 2nd time around

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I will be able to view thread from work, but have zero access to trading platforms or my MB Navigator. I hope you guys have a good day or night depending on where you are. I will be back later tonight to hopefully snag some more trades. As a recap of just last night I missed 2 signals, but hit 2, and nailed a looser. Not sour one bit, because loosing is part of trading. Good to see that Psycic and Stevewide are getting the hang of it. I hope that you two can be very successful in this and any other method you guys use. For anyone else wanting to jump and try this method, I will be on practically everyday to help answer any questions the best that I can(Psycic is doing a good job of that too). Be back later, I hope I don't miss to many signals

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Raz, Many thanks for sharing the system, I just found it tonight and applied on my live account. I'm not a successful trader as yet, but looks like I'm learning from some very good guys and soon I'll be. I wish good luck to you all and of course forexfactory!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Wouldn't that be roughly 2000 pips a week ?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
His calculations are all correct, except that it's not 160% , its 16% weekly. $160 $1000 = 16% However the most I have had winners in a week are 365 pips. I believe 2000 is way out of reach. However I should have let Steve answer that, but excellent job to Stevewide on showing a nice profit per week on a rather small account.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Good luck everyone, have a good day/night to all. Raz Out!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks for correcting my math. This is an example. It is not my actual performance with this method as I just started. But I've had nice winners except one. Watching Uj for long but this time of day its just drifting rangebound. Rsi hardly moving at all. Would be nice if it swung down below 40 level, then cross 55 level and close.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Thank Mr. Raz for your appreciation, ill try my best. I feel as if this style of trading belongs to me. some kind of attachment For every ones info. im just 21 . But im sure that iv got the knowledge of a person trading forex for 10+ years. Thats bcz iv been trading since 3 years now. What an age to start.haha.. But im learning and getting there. Hope i can help others and myself here.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Well good to hear, and I....like others will be hopefully be here to assist. Personally I hope you have live traded before, and if this i your first time trading live, please go very low low risk. I really want you to have confidence and comfort when experiencing live money on trading period, whether it will be this method or any other method. I did not state in this thread before, but R:R and money management has to be a very must in trading this method, or any method. But good to hear that you are excited about it, and I will do my very best to help you be successful as you can be.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Steve you are grasping it well. Same thoughts run through my head too when I watch the market flow, you tend to say things like' if the market will just dip and the reverse to give me a signal', very good to see that you understand what needs to happen. Keep in mind the more trades you do take, I believe with this system will render you more pips. I try to make sure that I use all the indicators to paint a picture of what out weighs the other, whether I enter or leave it alone. Keep in mind trading is risking regardless how valid the signal was. Just like the swissy I lost money on, I took the risk and I lost, but hey that is trading and I happy with it. So GJ Stevewide

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Good thing you mention, I am 31 and got into this around 25, but lost so much money that I quite for a 2 years. Then tried it again only to lose again, and quit for another year. However I learned one common trend in my losses. EMOTIONS! After peeling myself off the ground and learning from my own personal mistakes now I have a better understanding. I would make crucial errors based on my emotions. However at your age, I am throughly thrilled to see that you are taking this serious. Props to you, and anyone else willing to take on such a brutal market. However I have received so much help on various sites, and I believe the second part of trading successfully is helping others, glad to see you be a part of it.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Raz, Your basic basic method is Long or Short trend based on H4 with triple averages of 5, 10 and 20 emas, and entry based on RSI over 55 /under 45 and 3-20 ema. Since these are cross overs of MAs, they can be described a MACDs with various periods. One of the criteria you mentioned is to recognize the momentum of MACD whilst considering the trade. Take a look at the attached chart. The TDI or Traders Dynamic Index is just an RSI with Bol bands and averages. I have modified the levels to 55,50 and 45. It comes from the Synergy method of trading. It maybe a distraction from a regular RSI10, but does give earlier indications of probable trades. The third indi is a plot of difference of DI+ and DI- of two two time frames. I have chosen H4 and M30 since these are two time frames your method refers to. Calculations are based on Close of Chart Time Frame and Open for the longer time period. The Second indi "Raz_Indi" is a summary of all your moving average. Green bars you see is the difference between the macds of 5-10 ema and macd of the 10 -20 ema of H4. The white line is Close above and below the difference detrended with 20 ema of M30. The yellow line is a triple LWMA of period 8 of the macd of 3-20ema on the M30. Sounds a little complicated but really it isnt. A picture is worth a thou_____ etc. If TDI is above 55 and White is above Yellow and Yellow is above the green bars, you have a Long trade. Additional conformation is the ADX. If Yellow is above the bars and zero line etc. Let me know your thoughts. Pat

Very nice of you to create a variation of this method. As you may not know I am not very good at programming of any sorts, I just learned to post pics on here a few months ago . However I will definetly have to spend interest into this sort of setup. I am curious to see if will give me similar LONG or SHORT entries when they happen with the method that I use. However I am still at work, and can only few this forum and do not have access to my trading platform. But I am anxious to take a look tonight. Nicely done.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Sounds crazy, but I have the patience and beliefs that I will get there. So I started midway this month with this goal at exactly the 15th of October. I will update my live balance amount when I get done with trades for a night or a long period. I am looking to make a minimum of 10% of my account balance per month, and hopefully more. I do not have the graph right now(i will post it later), but if you take 10% of $400 dollars = $40. So if I end up with $440+ then I have exceeded my currently montly goal. Therefore next month I will shoot for the minimum of 10% of that current month balance. Saying I had $440 as balance, then 10% of $440 = $44, making a balance now of $484. You get the point now. Well as I progressed the math each month, by the 7th year I will have grossed over $1 million dollars, considering that I will not be able to withdraw any money from this account. So there is the long term goal, and the long term patience. And I am going to get there!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Well Looks like I did not miss anything, some signals, but all filtered out by MACD. So good news I didnt miss anything. Ahh looky here USD/JPY is indicating low trend strength. But a long maybe in the works here.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Gonna wait for close, but definetly interested in this trade long. Broke recent highs for the last 25 candles.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Live Trade: Little risky, but Long USD/JPY 91.18

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Amazing work pat, i like what uv done so far....Im still a bit confused about a few things, but over all nice way of putting everything in one chart so that we dont have to see the 4 H charts everytime...If you wouldnt mind sharing the Indi's so that we can compare if the setups are the same or not.Thnx a ton N Mr Raz, the usd/jpy trade i would have take from 91.00 because this time the up momentum was supported by 1h charts.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
7 years left to become a Millionare Im with u on this....but my target is more or less 4 years with a $2000 account, im lazy to do the math but ya compounded monthly ill get there haha...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I agree, but I am staying true to my entries, which is close of candles, and yes its sitting in the red. However I feel confident that it will hit. May take an a hour or so

--- 帖子 #94 ---
dont you worry this will come for sure..Looks good to me to and yes my entry from 91.00 was on the candle close of the previous candle. so as such i was stayng true to the entry as well..

--- 帖子 #95 ---
This is like watching Ice melting in the fridge. Oh well, if it hits +25, it will, if it dont. I will wait for 2 more close of candles and start moving my stops on recent lows of candles.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Happy to see that. Here is an example why I put a fixed stop at +20 pips, because it went to +24.2 pips, but did not hit +25. I rather not lose a good push so I took +20 pips and that is a winner for me. It will probably hit +25 later, but I will take a short shot winner. Ty for support Psycic

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I LIKE I LIKE....We are good

--- 帖子 #98 ---
considering where you entered it looks like your would have hit +25 easily, and I am very pleased if it did.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
yup i i took +35 a few pips xtra kept stop at +20 nevr touchd it...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Good job BRO! I did the same on this one I put +20 SL and +30 TP and see if it would climb, but it bit back and took out my +20 SL, but I am very please to see that happen. Are you trading live money?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
GB/USD buy what do you think?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Lil tough to see right now. Staying true to my method, I would pass it up because of MACD Signal LINE

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Agrred with you sir.... passd it 2.... seeing the MACD.... you have a few hours off nw,,, Have fun..

--- 帖子 #104 ---
yup totally live money, this is what my dad tought me(he is a fx trader to since almost 8 years nw) yu never learn on demo..so ya i have my account but on his name lol.. but its all good whatever i get from that account is mine,,,,so its good...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Good morning all, I just took a quick +25pips on USD/CAD.entered at1.04748 and it hit the TP. This is really a good system.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
The challenges of this. From the current looks of it, looks like I can take a 90 min(3 candles) nap. Maybe catch a euro or cable long. Swissy I think is out of action tonight or at least for a bit. And the YEN is climbing. So gonna see if I can catch a reverse later.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
took a reverse of Gbp/Usd with confirmed signals... @ 1.6592..stop 25 pips target 1.6540 lets see how this goes...

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Trade closed at +1 felt fishy to me....

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I'm on a long @1.6607, missed an opportunity to close at 1.6628 as I was late for a min .

--- 帖子 #110 ---
You know I would have stayed away from this one, because we are in LONG MODE, like your risky approach, but I don't fight the prevailing trend

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Question? I didn't quite catch a valid Long during this last 4 candles. Did your platform give you a Long entry signal? Or is your entry based on a different method? Just curious, I hope it hits for your sake

--- 帖子 #112 ---
99% chances that it will touch my tp, but emotionally i was biased for a long so came out.....

--- 帖子 #113 ---
there was no trade according to raz's trade signals....on what basis did you take the trade....

--- 帖子 #114 ---
hey good morning lets see if we can catch some trades today

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Morning !!! hopefully we will....good to see you on the same boat with us...

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I am sorry to admit, it was my emotion and I took that trade at 5:01 GMT. I have another funny trade which I'm hanging with since yesterday, short @1.6457. I have to teach myself to behave and follow the rule!! I have blown £8000 last month which I made over the past two months . But somehow I have a feeling, I can see the light now and I have some very talented friends like you all. Many thanks and wish me luck so that I can be civilized!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
we are with you.... and as for your 1.6457 trade... Emotions screw up everything iv learnd to control them you should to. It helps.. but today even my emotions took over me...this was a good sell, even the system gave a sell signal i just had to cut it, and now its 12 pips short of my tp../damn... goo 50 pips lost

--- 帖子 #118 ---
at the time you took your buy there was a buy signal but it wasnt supported by the MACD if you look back...PAY ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING NEXT TIME YOU ENTER!!!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Gbp/Usd sel touched my TP...good reversal trade!!! 50 pips damn i just to 1 out of it..

--- 帖子 #120 ---
It's ok Dream we all have slip and come short in this area but you know what though GBP/US is a very tricky pair to trade and required alot of discipline..i trade it for a year with little to no success..pick up other pair and the pips jus kept rolling in.BTW you guys have got a wonderful thing going on here i wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hey guys be careful red flag news comming up at 08:30 GMT..probably need to sit on your hands for now.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thnx stunna, agree gbp/usd has a mind of its own. Thnx for the appreciation, hope you liked what mr Raz has done here.. Kudos to the man..!! Best of luck to you to if your joing us or whtever your system is that you trade with!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
i find this macd setting to be very powerful..first try 1 lot currently up +52= $520..not bad for a nights work.Hopefully i am not straying form Raz setting..if i am please let me know Raz and i will delete this post..but overall wonderful system. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Good first try sir, firstly Raz wouldnt have taken this trade because the 4h gbp was still in buy. According to Raz some times these trades work and some times they dont. but it was a good reversal trade.. some one should come up with a condition to when we can trade against the 4h trend(reversal trade)....

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Going out for 8-10 hours be back later...hope to see every one making pips and new ideas generating here...C u guys Happy piping!!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hello there, first of all I will never disregard anyone else's good work in making pips. I welcome any sort of method to making pips. Good job, and glad to see that you snagged some pips. I am happy to see that others here will add their own different methods or variations in trading pairs. As you may not know I am very disciplined in my approach and will stick with my method, but if you do have any questions or concerns feel free to post away.... Good Pippin to ya!!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Listen fellow trader, I can relate to you 100%, losing sucks!! And you can not paint any other picture about it. I would be more then happy to assist you in any way I can. However please I would recommend that you demo or trade micro lots on this method till you are comfortable with it, before putting live money into it. Well trade at your own risk. So far this week I am +45 pips(with a -25 pips calculated into that) and I have missed plenty of good signals(+75 pips worth). So I know this system works. If you have questions on positions and I or Psycic are here, just post and ask. We shall be happy to confirm or deny whether this would be something we would take. I want everyone to be successful. So chin up forex buddy, loosing is harsh and priceful lesson to learn from.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Well good job today, just a couple of trades for you I think, but good job on +35 on yen today. As long as we are always in the +Green thats all that matters. Hope to see you later.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
[quote=raz;3168472]As you may not know I am very disciplined in my approach and will stick with my method/quote] Keep telling us this. It helps. Steve

[quote=stevewide;3168597] All the time bro, will be here for a long time, at least for for the next seven years LOL

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Good look trading today. Will validate my signals when I get back to backtest them. I can answer questions at work via this forum, but will not have access to my trading platform. Take it easy have a good day/night

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hey, Raz. Thanks for this system. Looks like it certainly has merit. I took the same UJ trade you did earlier, but I came in on the next candle. Was waiting for the ADX yellow to be Above "25". Does it just have to be pointed in the correct angle or must it be touching or Above the "25". I missed out on the TP and hit my SL. ggrrrrr

--- 帖子 #133 ---
First I recommend demo'ing or low risk micro lots on this method till you grow comfortable with it like I have. I have stated before in this thread that I will take trades even if the ADX Line (Yellow) is below 25. Below the 25 line is a indication of strength of trend. Also it is a lagging indicator. I am displeased that you had a SL, however I can see if you entered in one candle late then I can see the short shot trend had self exhausted. Remember we are looking for the candle close of the 55 line on RSI(for example going Long). this is from post#10 on this thread earlier .. Now that we know when we are in LONG or SHORT MODE , now we flip to the 30 min TF, and this is where the fun begins. In LONG MODE; THE Musts! (I don't know if Musts is a word, but it's sounds cool) I am looking for the 3 EMA to be closed above the 20 EMA, the actual candle itself can close on the lines, but the 3 EMA line has to be above 20 EMA line. Does not have to be fresh cross of the two. First! Whic is the most vital entry signal that I truly look for, this is a definite must. My only true entry signal. I need a close of through the '55' line of the RSI. It can come from the bottom, or bounce down from the top, but it must close at slant through the '55' line. This has to be instant with the most current, or sometimes most current two candles(which I call a connecting candle, I will explain later). This all can better be explained with a pic. Next I look at my ADX, I look for two things, first priorty is how far below or above the 25 line are we, this will indicate strength of a trend. Although if it is below the 25 line, I will still sometimes take the entry. Next I look at the +DI, and see what direction it is going, if I am in LONG MODE then I have to have the green line above the red line to indicate positive direction. This, very much like the MACD(that I am going to explain below) are filters, not signals for valid entries. Lastly the lovely MACD. This and the ADX are purely my filters for my trades, I do not use the MACD to take any signals, just like I don't with the ADX. Keep in mind my only signal taker in trading is the RSI. However with MACD it truly is my main filter. Like I mentioned before, please research what these indicators are and understand their meanings. For the MACD, we all know it is a lagging indicator. However with this method I want to trade with the momentum, not against it. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s.../yim/whew!.gif So with MACD, I am looking at the histogram and signal line, and where they came from. I take the last 15 candles, and visualize them. I see to myself the momentum of what direction has been favored recently. So first I look at the histogram, and see the strength of momentum. Must show that it is going bullish(looking for longs). Even if the histogram is below the 0 line, I will still use this for bullish confirmation if there is significant lose in Negative momentum. If the histogram shows very low activity, and seems to hover up and below the 0 line, but still very close to it, then I will probably void my chance of any trade, because this usually indicates range market. Anyways back to LONG MODE, after determining my the histogram favors my direction, I at look the signal line, and where it came from. If the signal line is falling, the most likely it will be a false signal(and I analyse the last 15 candles to justify this). If the signal line is shooting up(looking 15 candles back), then of course this confirms my Long entry, also if the signal line is up but dips a little and now sideways(looking 15 candles back) then I still long. Remember MACD is a lagging indicator. So to recap on Long entry; 3 EMA above 20 EMA RSI most clean break the '55' line. ADX does not have too, but indicate strong trend above or below the 25 line; also looking for green to be above the red. MACD Histogram paints a picture of history, and yes it can confirm + or - momentum. Signal line must be up, or sideways(but recently up) both looking 15 candles back. Enter Long, 25 pip TP with 25 SL. Below are pics that show valid entries, one is a fresh cross of the RSI, and the other is what I call a bounce of the RSI ...once again sorry you missed it, but hopefully you can rebound and catch the next one.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
see last white arrow showing rsi crossed 55; strong crossing slope. Decent MACD; while below 0 line it had a strong upward histo and signal line. Weak ADX; DI+ above DI- but ADX below 25. Anywho, it seemed a good trade. I like setting 25 tp/sl and forget it except to lock in 20 pips with my sl when or if it happens. Looking for next trade. Thanks RAZ. Steve EDIT: tp now hit; put it down for +25. I'm impressed!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks for the reply, Raz. Will try to pay closer attention in future trades. Also, rest assured there is not much ventured on these beginning trades, not until I'm more comfortable with picking winners http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Steve: Well done mate! Nice trade! Raz, are you using the stop of 25pips for any m30 pair? or do you use a larger stop? Have you noticed when you get into your trades, do you seem to be getting a 15-20 pip drawdown before your trade goes into profit or anything similar? Many thanks for your time.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Stevewide GJ . I will have to look at that entry when I get home, can't see anything from work. WilteredFire, I do use a 25 pip stop loss on all 4 pairs that I trade. I know other pairs like GBP/JPY I would use a 50 pip stop loss, but on this method I do not trade it. At times I have seen the trade go -23 pips and still hit my target. Yes I do expect a drawdown on a lot of trades. Just like the USD/JPY trade I took last night live. It went -12 for about an hour, and then turned up to hit TP.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I know you pointed out a lot times the RSI hit the 55 line(in your pic). I think from Stevewide's example we all can see that it important to time the entry right when it is correct, like Stevewide did. That's what this method is all about, timing the right window and catching the momentum at the same time. Rarely happens, but highly hits! Good analysis Stevewide!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Good job Stevewide!!!! nice trade...i just saw it i would have taken it to!! just came back long day!!! wasaaap Mr raz...hwz wrk? there was a trade on usd/jpy also a buy! and it hit 25 tp arnd 24 but ya same thing.... another trade in eur/usd hit 25 pip tp.....and the gbp/usd trade which steve took so over all i missed 3 trades all hit 25 tp!!! thats another 75 pips missed hope i get a trade soon..!!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Whats up Psycic, well works is work, sucks! However I will have to look at these signals when I get back later today. From your guy's account looks like we had some hitters. So it good to see that this week turned out to be a good week of trades, it's just too bad I couldn't take em from work.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thanks again Raz for reminding the rules, at last I got rid of one bad trade, I'm getting there, discipline. I had that GPB/USD trade too. But honestly speaking, I'll move to other pair, no more GBP, it's too small and doesn't even need wind to fly! Thanks everyone, I'm planning a millionaire party in seven years time!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
yah same here bro had a class in uni(porfolio management) suckd bad....plus the long car drives + the back aches...bah never ending....yes it turned out to be a really good week of trades...hopefully from what iv seen and learnt every week will be like this god willing!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Looking back I see that there were two signals on eur/usd. One winner and one loser. Looking back I see on GBP/USD giving you one good signal for a winner(very close to being stopped out, depending on broker this could have been stopped). I think I would be consertive and call this one a possible loser. Definete follow up winner. Looking back I see on USD/CHF good solid signal for a winner. So 3 possible winners, and definetly one loser or maybe two. Not so great for the raz method, but still positive. I am just being fair to my back test results. I do not want to visualize the raz method as a holy grail. So I want to justify losses anyway I can to show you that it will have one occasionally. Pics to Illustrate Cable: real tricky, if you got in on the first siganl, then no losses, just one winner. If you took the second signal, then you would maybe loss(it went 25 pips south of close), but then if you caught the third signal then you would have made up for it. Euro: Definete one loser no doubt about it, I would have taken it. However stay focussed and get the next one. Swissy: Easy winner, pure valid signal

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Well this has been a crappy week for me, NOT BECAUSE OF LOSERS!! because I have missed a lot of the valid trades. However I do document them down, and as most of you who have followed me daily on this realize that I post all the trades, even if I miss them. So being fair about it there has been; 10 winners (four I have taken) 3 Lossers (one I have taken) So far it is shaping up to be a normal week of trading. 11 to 13 winners, and 3 to 4 losers. Going for a quick hike, gotta get some cardio in. Will be back in an hour, lets take some trades tonight.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Nice little rally right now, but like I mentioned before, a big candle like this has a high chance of a retrace. I will look for a retrace somewhere in next candle and then look for entry for LONG. If all confirms

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I passed it up, because right at close of candle the histogram closed with no positive up movement and the signal line is pointing down. Invalid entry within last few secs.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Good Mordning raz, I worked yesterday strictly after your strategy, and i'm glad to see all the trades i took were the ones you would have taken, the only one i didnt took was the second one in the GBP/USD chart of yours because the RSI was already above the 55line. Anyway im looking forward to next week as i will start taking the trades on my real account. Thanks /edit, i think after a while you dont get frustrated at all if you get a loser because you know there will be winner, and losing trades are unavoidable and part of every good and profitable strategy.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Sounds unlikely. However I have set forth a plan to achieve this goal with my method. I know with good discipline and consistency I can get there. Starting with a balance of $400 dollars(which I started this month on the 16th) and targeting a minimum of 10% monthly account balance goal. Let it accumulate from that point on, then I should have no issues hitting a million dollars in 7 years. Of course if I hit a higher percentage then 10% per month well then I should insure that I hit my goal sooner then 7 years. I have attached a file showing you the calculations of taking 10% per month and then adding it to the total and taking the following month and going 10% of the new balance. As you can clearly see at 84 months(months are in the boxes) the account value well exceeds a million. I know it sound like a long journey, but hey I am willing to take the time to get there.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Exactly, that is why I clearly wanted to demostrate that I would have taken those signals, and accepted those as real losses. I guess for being at work it kept from getting a valid signal which was a loss, but I still would have been ahead. Good to hear from you, hopefully next week we can make some real loot.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
btw take care today are some red flagged data incl. Bernanke speaking, so markets are likely to fluctuate ... i dont take any trades 30mins before and after data is released.

Dear Raz &amp; Physic, I have survived from the cursh, from now no more indiscipline! I'll organize the millionare party positively in 7 years time. Best of luck for all followers of this thread.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Good to hear that you are expressing a normal heart beat right now. LOL Just kidding. Yes I am going to take baby steps with this method, and if anyone is out there that wants to embark on this journey..... we we all get there.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Well as I stated in earlier posted. If I do not get a valid signal for about the next 4 to 5 candles. Then I am calling it a week. Looking forward to next week to having another succesful week. I do want to point that I was very shocked to say the least that more then one or anyone had slight interest in this method. I really did not think that much of anyone would think this system was much to care for, being that TP's were low. However I guess through Live trades and explanations you can see that your losses are limited with this method. I know this was the first week, but there will be many up coming($$). For those like Psycic;Stevewide;dreamfx;iTrader and the rest that I did not mention(i do apologize), I am really impressed how well you all are adapting to this and actually going foward with it. Your guys' input is greatly appreciated and always welcomed. So lets keep it rolling. Raz Not the Leader here but a fellow trader with you all!

whats up people......i see we had trades... in usd/jpy(2 trades both +25) and usd/cad (1 trade +25) missed them again, damn uni..... ill be looking for sell and only sell in gbp/usd nw... good pipin people!!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hahaha im realy happy for you!!! party is on!!!!!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Raz bro, dd you take the euro buy just nw cz i found it was a valid trade just dint take it cz it was near a major resistance...!!!

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I passed it up, MACD Signal Line was shooting down. Filtered it out. Good analysis on resistance

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I took this trade because rsi went to oversold up thru 55 level while macd wasn't doing anything near its 0 line while price was rising creating slight divergence. ADX wasn't pretty going down while DI+ was at DI- but pointing upward. It wasn't my best setup. Entry was candle after last white arrow. Steve

--- 帖子 #160 ---
The reason why i actually opened an account in Forex factory was bcz of "THE RAZ SYSTEM", IMAGINE THAT!!!! could i say more? hehehe..... im always with u!!!!!!!!! we will kill forex $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ to all !!!!!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Obviously I did not take this trade, but I can see where you had very good reasons to validate the purpose. And you know what sometimes it is just a good gut feeling as to what you can garner from this analysis and make an entry, just like when I lost earlier this week I took a 90% confirmed signal and took the risk based on my gut feeling however that time I lost. Looks as if though you got in and hit the TP, from what I just saw. Either way I like your thought process and it made sense of it. GJ

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I appreciate your feedback very much. I learn alot from you. What was the worse thing about this trade that you saw, if you don't mind my asking. Steve

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Well thats awesome, and needless to say there is a wealth of knowledge on forexfactory.com all over the place. I have learned so much from so many differrent posters here. I spent a good year as a non member just reading post after post, and then became a member to comment on various topics. But it is traders like you and Stevewide and the bunch that motivates me everyday to stick with it and make it a success. So the system is now in place, it is time on our hands that will be the biggest mountain to now over come!!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Everything lined up, but the MACD signal line, which I know is lagging, was shooting down for me. The histogram was hoppin up and down the 0 line, but that confirmed bullish movement because of the back track of the last 14 to 15 candles showed recent hight positive bullish momentum, so the histogram wasn't the filter. However it was the signal line that filtered it out for me. I wouldn't say there was anything worse about it, but I felt from watching the cable plummit(and sometimes it has a parallel effect on the euro) that it would affect the euro. I sometimes tend to be very conservative in my approach which does lead me to miss out on a lot of good hitters, but hey thats me. Since I have used this method, and taking all super valid signals(I mean pure obvious signals) I have never had a losing week in total trades or pips. I know that is yet to be seen, but as we go forward I will hope to show with live trades that this what I intend to imply. Anyhow you are doing a great job, so keep it up. Ask me anytime you want I never mind.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
same here iv been reading posts here since i guess forever. haha. finally joined it...Iv learnt a lot to. But nothing ever apealed to me to join forex factory...may it was ur system or i dunno...The vibes just pulled me here....and rest is history... and as for time - Thats one issue we have to conquer to be succesfull.. The system is SET and SO ARE WE. BONVOYAGE!!

Psycic &amp; Raz, Please help me selecting currency pair, I an not with GBP anymore! Many thanks as always.........

--- 帖子 #167 ---
RAZ: Thanks for letting me get in your brain a little more. My guess is you would have given it more consideration if the macd signal line was flat instead of down. I read the Gbp is very weak. But I can't trade fundamentals even after reading the red flag prelim. GDP was bad for the Gbp. I look at the 4h chart you use and see at this point in time the correlation broke down for reasons beyond me...chart below. However, the chance I took is not worth much trying to justify. Eu may drop down and give us a good signal. I think I'm learning that's what you wait on. You demonstrate the discipline I need. I have an engineer's education so am into details...slow learner...details help me learn discipline. Wandered lost for 3 years almost fulltime in forex factory. Your method works well for me and let's see how much discipline I can muster to hang in there and make something happen this time. There are several other threads I keep up with with mixed success...all goes back to the discipline the method creates in me. I don't like having to wait for almost the entire day at times with this method but so far its making pips and is possible to go live soon. Have scalped for 5 pips successfully live but realized the broker was making almost the same as I was. Alot of work for 30% expenses on each trade so started looking again for at least 10 pips/trade....and found you. Also, have my eye on several good day chart trading methods that I can check once daily using small lots so I can psychologically feel I'm in a trade. Thanks for this nice forum I could vent. Honesty is required for learning trading profitable. Most folks won't admit their losses. You will. I will. I'm impressed. Steve Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I was wondering, if we add a stochastic to determin market condition like over bought or over sold, would that be useful? And what about scalping using lower time frame and smaller profit target when we have time to glue with the computer? ( I actually did that and it worked, had to be careful with news). Many thanks for yours advice.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Just followed proper signal and a good trade with USD/CHF, didn't wait all the way though, closed after 7 pips profit as I am not very familier with this pair, practicing. Cheers RAZ Method!!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Anyone see Uj as a trade when macd signal line flattened? I haven't taken a signal after the rsi signals above 55 before but believe I may have missed a good trade. Comments? Steve

--- 帖子 #171 ---
should kept u/chf, would hit TP, same time found U/J signal too. I believe i'm getting there, no regret for missing, i have 7 years left!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Well to answer your question on currency pairs, I only trade the 4 majors. If it is your personal comfort to avoid the cable then by all means do so. Dreamfx I would recommend reading the first two pages of this thread one more time, it will take you roughly 4 to 7 mins of reading. Even though you may have read it already give it a second time around to help you understand the feeling of how this method works. As for stochastics, well one of the reasons why I do not use stochastics is; 1) that would be another indicator to filter more trades, because remember only one indicator is in use to signal an entry. Remember from trades like Beachbum(from the Fozzy Method) and James16 have stated before that the more indicators you have the less trades you will take. We have to take some sort of risk in trading in order to open up our opportunities to trade. 2) I do not believe Stochastics can really justify Overbought or Oversold areas on the 30 min time frame, in my opinion I think stochastics works way better on longer timeframes, like 4hr or daily. Remember dreamfx this is me, not you. Customize your perception of this method or any method to how you feel. Adding stochastics will help you, then give it a try. Document down the reasons why, what, when, how of trade characteristics when signals come up, and keep your notes down. That is what an experiment is all about, trying something new and keeping notes of what happens. The more you test, the more notes you can document and compare later, the more chances of creating a successful path. So I have a question for you dreamfx, are you going to go broke if you trade for the next 3 weeks and not make any more money or lose money, in other words break even?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
i would have taken the trade bcz adx was still above 25 and was showing buy!!!!! was a valid signal according to me... i dnt knw if it gives 25 pps but wat i saw it did give 20 pips for sure....im not taking any trades 2day just a very messy market...ill wait for monday n kill it!!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thanks a lot RAZ, I believe I won't! You are right, more indicators, less trade, once again I'm suggesting myself....discipline. I believe we had a few good signals today, so if we have enough time, we don't need more experiments.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Good you won't go broke. Then I suggest that you trade micro lots for the next 3 weeks at least for this method so each win or loss is really just chump change. I know this sound like a long time, but over a longer period of time it can go a long ways. If you trade micro lots, this will take the EMOTION factor out of trading at least for the next few weeks. Then afterwards I believe you can approach this method systematically and with less EMOTIONS . Trust me, it was what I had to do to peel myself off the ground after my major lossess. You will only get better after you lose some. Just my suggestion thats all bro.....

--- 帖子 #176 ---
yeah I am done for the day. Not a bad week, still was posistive being that I only caught 5 trades. Next week I will work really hard to try and be available to catch as many as signals as I can.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
i didnt take any trade today, fridays are always weird... have a nice weekend all, cu on monday hopefully making then some real dollars

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Iv lost a lot from my dads account and felt bad abut it for decades, but he dint say a word to me.. But nw im ovr my emotions when my signal does come up.. its either +25 or -25 that its !!!!!iv learnt to control then....!!! finally aftr losing like i dnt knw how many $$$$....bt any ways....monday will be a good start of the week!!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
ur saying you have to work hard, i have tokill my ass of for the coming week to see where i stand !!! hectic week ahead!! n e wayz...cheers for the week end the stress bustin time!!! I luv to drink so cheers !!!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Just trade the four majors thats it, you dont need anything else with this...4 pairs are hard enough to keep track of...!!!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Steve since u do a full time thing, think of it as this way. If u were working in a company you have to devote a cenrtan no. of hours just to work. n here our work is trading so i guess staring at the screen and waiting for our setup is worth the wait because your working!! this is what most people fail to realize, if ur a full time forex trader that means ur working. every one's looking for easier methods to avoid working by building EA's, if it was that easy woudnt every one be millionairs...after watchin the charts for so long and then you get a good trade dont you feel good.!!!!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
right on Psychic......

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I am going to post a new stat tracker below each of my post, to show where I sit currently. Easy to read as you can see. I will post all the valid signals as we go day to day, and the ones that I miss.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thanks, that great... Hope you get your target and more, your work on here is an inspiration (plus the other guys helping out...)

--- 帖子 #185 ---
hey no problem. I will be posting pics on every valid signal that comes up, whether I catch em or I don't. Next week will be intersting to see if I can nail the months goal before this month is over considering I started this month on the 16th.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
making that goal is up to the market and your schedule because I know you won't force a trade just to reach a goal. Steve

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Raz, I am a newbie here and am interested in ur thread I think it will be great if there is an alert or sound alert or even email alert whenever your system get a signal. And from there, we use our own judgement to enter the trade or not. Because most of us are working and does not have the time to watch the screen every minutes or hour. I love to have one but pity i cannot do programming. Maybe anybody can help? Thank you

--- 帖子 #188 ---
As you may have read, I have a full time job as well. This will always pose a problem for me. As for alerts; I would have to say I have absolute zero knowledge on programming as well. I do not even think that I am using the MT4 to its full potential. I do know you can set alerts based on position values, but as for crosses of indicators I have not learned that yet. I was hoping someone on here can provide any knowledge of how to set alerts, especially whent he RSI is getting near the signal point. At this point I don't know. Sorry I couldn't help, but hopefully somewhere down the line I will probably switch to 'xtick' where it makes sense to pay for it each month. I have read reviews that this platform does about everything you need to do, even sends sms messages to alert you when there are crosses. That would be very useful for me. So I agree with, alerts/e-mail/sms would all be helpful.

Any time and all the time bro....n Btw ill search for a Rsi with alret and post it here, So that when ever rsi crosses 45-55 you get an alret makes it easier to watch the market!!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Looks like a possibility, still have to see how the candle closes

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Was looking like a nice long on YEN, but I guess not

--- 帖子 #197 ---
yup, i was waiting for it too

--- 帖子 #198 ---
just going to have to watch it, and see if it makes another turn at it upwards. Hopefully if we take this trade that we can get some fuel behind it.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Watching these boys, both looking to give us an opportunity.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Well going to have to give it a few more candles to see if I can catch a PA move. Looks like the yen is the only real deal here, but need it to close and all strongly confirm. Euro I feel is just gonna range a bit, the yellow adx line is well below 20, somewhere at 15.38 definite ranging.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
except of the adx, usdchf looks like a sell coming ?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
rsi alert I use to alert you to 45/55 crossing; no sound, just visual. Steve

Live Trade: Short 1.0060 This may take sometime, lol

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Im in at 1,0058 Lets see where this journey goes

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Well I cross my fingers for your too. I think this one will take few hours to hit. What does not help is the euro is ranging.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Euro looking nasty, but I got a feeling there is going to be quick little jump on it soon.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
still looks good to drop; slow time of day; Monday; anything can happen. S

--- 帖子 #209 ---
ELVIS LIVES!!!!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Sure and the swissy trade is still alive too

--- 帖子 #211 ---
yeah it will be a long one. However I like to get that first one out for the week. I feel its gonna hit, just time on our hands.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Gotta work in a couple hours, so got my TP and SL set so be back in a 90 mins

--- 帖子 #213 ---
looks like I misjudged a good trade. The macd signal line was very slightly dropping so I passed. S

--- 帖子 #214 ---
yup i was looking at it too, but the line filtered it out for me ... i guess usdchf is about to hit SL

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hmm, did your SL hit, my did not. Looks like we are still in th game. gotta run to work. Hopefull this will curve back down and work its way back down

--- 帖子 #216 ---
im still in, it was very close like -22 or something ...

--- 帖子 #217 ---
We can do this!!! Hehe, I will have to watch from work. I got my triggers set, but will see what happens at work.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
now it my hit SL, winners will come lets look out for the next possible setups

--- 帖子 #219 ---
sl hit; anything can happen in this game of probabilities; my odds are in my favor with more wins than losses; so I'm winning with RAZ's method. Where's the next trade? Steve

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Bleh, of course it hits SL. But it is a stats game with me like Steve said, so when I get home from work today I will look for valid sigs and take em as they go. Winners and losers apart, I will withstand em all.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
sory guys had Uni.....just came back....Iv seen you trade on the chf i would have never taken a sell in it even if it was ranging 2day, Only buys were my prefrence. This is what i could analyse in the morniing and this is what happened.. So i guess come times im right to hehe...and chf target is 1.0160 so i missed this buy signal for chf and if it goes down again im going to buy when i get my signals...

--- 帖子 #222 ---
usd/chf touched my target area 1.0160 and can go to 1.0180 but my target was this....damn!!!! i hate when things llike this happen!!!! missed an amazing trade!!!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Raz: Do you take trades if the signal isn't good enough when all lines up latter? Do you only reevaluate latter on a closed candle only or as soon as open candle signals line up? Is there a limit to the number of candles that you will wait on for a good signal? Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi All, It was a long day at work, just adapting new time from today (UK). Looks like I missed a lot. Thanks for the alart, i'm going to apply it now. There's nothing better than a good company!!!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi DreamFx, thats right nothing better than company gbpusd hit TP +25 first winner on real account hehe

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi, Some time ago I posted a chart with "Raz Indi" Over the weekend i was working on a visual way of deciding if a trade is in making or not. I have two indis that need consideration. The first one is attached and is called RSI_Cloud. Visually it shows potential of validating trades with stop lossess as well as potential trailing stops. specially when used in combination with a multicolored LWMA of 48. Why 48? Number of 30 minute bars in a day as of now. Can be optimized but may not be necessary. It draws the Highs and Lows of bars that meet the requirement of Greater than 55 and Less than 45 levels of RSI 14. I know Raz suggested the period to be 8 however 14 seems to be a standard period used for RSI . The reason I include this indi is to fully establish the rules of trade strictly based on RSI. Please bear with me on this one. Pat1

--- 帖子 #251 ---
This is how I see this Long trade: RC(RSI_Cloud) is blue Low is greater than Low value of RC MA_AP is green Buy at upper value of blue RC with stop loss of lower value of blue RC MA_AP is trailing stop. Trailing begins when MA_Ap is greater than upper value of blue. Trade ends if trailing stop is hit or TP of 25 pips, which ever occurs first. Reverse for Short Tarde. Let me know if it meets the requiremnt of RSI. Pat

--- 帖子 #252 ---
To answer my own question above, I think you can trade anytime after an initial rsi signal as soon as the other indicators line up. Attached are the 4 pairs I trade along with a yellow line at the time a 30m candle closes with a very good signal(DI+ or DI- sloped upward, rsi sloped past 45/55 and macd histo and signal line sloped toward trade. Three already paid 25+ with Gu just entered short. Its late in the NY afternoon session so need luck to push it thru. Watching price action is a good self teacher isn't it. Steve

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Stevewide my fellow trader, looks like that you brought up a very good point. Now I hate to make this answer so long, but it is something that I feel is important to me. This question that you ask is exactly what made me a frustrated trader. In the past I would look at a signal, and notice that all the signal are forming up BUT aren't quite confirming. However in my mind and thought process I would think " well it's going to form anyways with the next candle, better get in now!" and with my luck it wouldn't and I would lose out. Other times I would see the same scenario and then pass it up, only to watch it hit a solid TP. At that point it was a hair pulling fest for me. Other times I would enter a candle after the fact, because a couple or few candles later the trade materialized better and I would think 'hmm', this looks better, and it did hit or did not hit 50% of the time. So I wanted to stop being a frustrated trader. Or a 50% trader. Then about 7 months ago I wrote down my rules (The MUSTS &amp; The NEVERS) and stuck by them since. And would you believe it, it was the only time I have ever been positive trading Forex, ever ! Now I know that sounds crazy, but that is the truth. I have never made money before that point, oh yeah! I had my little flash of moments of forex brilliance because I GUESSED right. Thats all it was Guessing, a 50/50 shot. However over the long periods I never was ahead. There was even a week in June where I had 6 losing trades, and almost doubted my system through the week(ready to throw it out), but I still finished the week with 8 winners, net +2 winners. I have taught myself one thing that is preached all over all these forex sites, discipline will make you money! I self proved it, and believe in it now. So I guess to answer your question, I am so strict my system, that even if the candle jumps crazy I will only enter on closes(ususally with in the next min or 2 after the close) and the signals all have to valid for me to enter. This is me, and I recommend you guys do what is best fits your style. Just like the loss trade I had earlier, it did not bother me one bit, all it does is that it proves that this market is brutal, but I love it! So you all can clearly see, I am no pro, or no better then each and everyone of you. If anything you guys being a part of this makes me want to be a better trader. My only frustration is not being able to catch every signal, even if it did lose out. Anyways keep it up, this isn't my thread, it's our thread!! Jack some pips!!

--- 帖子 #254 ---
RAZ: I'm here because of your discipline. Its what impresses me most. You have nailed down rules far beyond what most of us can appreciate suggesting new indicators, new rules(like I just did in above posting) and other typical reactions of unsuccesful traders. One day I'll learn.........soon! Steve

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Inspirational...my xpale 2day can be a good like example.. I had my trade everything was in like the stop the tp it went against me it went in my direction i just dint have the discipline to stick to it... i have to work on my emotion its tough but ill nail them down sooner or later!!! Thnx for a inspiration raz!!!

I'm surprised but not disapporinted too much that my Gu short just stopped out. Slow time of day could have something to do with it. I don't know. I've lost both my trades today while missing good trades. But I trade what I see mechanically and believe this will make me successful. Steve

well I got home too late, noticed that there was a signal just 40 mins ago. I tried to catch the second valid signal. I know this is slow period, but I take all valid signals, and yes it stopped out. So far this week a pretty crappy start for me, but from experience this is nothing for me to worry about. I looked back and realized that I did miss 3 valid signals that hit. Including the one I missed because I got him just a late. If you look at the pic, if I had gotten in on the previous entry, would have been +25. Anyways staying true to myself, and I am going to rebound for sure this week.

Raz: This is a tough business. With solid rules though, we can do it. Thanks for your help. Steve

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Need to get some trades tonight if there are any signals. however I need sleep as well.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
That trend strength is nasty. I hope we can get some play tonight. Need to bounce back from two lossess CURRENT STATS: WEEKLY TRAIL: 3 WINS (3 MISSED) 2 LOSSES (0 MISSED) EARNED THIS WEEK $-22.72 MONTHLY TRAIL: STARTING BALANCE $400 MONTHLY GOAL $440 CURRENT BALANCE $395.92 (-11% OF C.M.G)

--- 帖子 #264 ---
What I like about this system is that it confirms the trend on 4H time frame before trading on 30M time frame which as Raz mentioned keep us on Long/Short mood. What I'm not comfortable with it is that I can't watch the chart every 30min. So although the back test shows a winning result but It just depent if I would have taken all the entries. Raz, you've done a great job and I keep reading this awesome thread.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Good morning guys, lets take hopefully some profitable trades today i mentioned yesterday night that there was a sell forming on gbpusd, well it went like -23 and then all the way down and hit target profit, if someone took it , good job and the closing of the usdjpy i think it was the right decision made to close it with profit, lets see what today will come ...

very wierd market no trades as of yet!!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Is this a valid signal on UJ?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
No the adx is still below 25, wait for it! !!!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
which signal wer eyou talking about the sell before or the buy which just occured!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
The buy signal. Except for the ADX, everything else was in place (including 4H chart). I took it (on demo of course). Let's see how it plays out

--- 帖子 #271 ---
yes slow markets, adx not gaining any momentum ... but better no trades, than losing ones good luck on this drmahathir

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hey Raz, I just sold EUR/JPY. Let's see how it goes

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hey Raz, I got +25 hit on EUR/JPY sell We need to figure out a a way of entering earlier.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
SL hit by sudden spike on UJ Earlier made +20 on EU and +25 on swissy

--- 帖子 #275 ---
OK how about this one on GU?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
eek, missed out because of sleep! Looking back I can only see two signals that I would have considered valid. I have posted pics of them right here. Euro, signal line starting to point down Swissy signal line pointing up. As you can see they both hit. Yikes! I just woke up, let me get see what you guys went through, and I will try and answer some questions.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
market is behaving really wierd i still wudnt enter! im waiting for thing which i actually can understand....PA is acting crazy!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Yes good to hear. I wanted to let you know that when I back test I definetly confirm that when the signals happens I look to see where we were in the 4hr chart, if it does not line up then for sure I do not call it a valid entry or document it at all on the 30 min TF even if it hits TP. Good to hear from you!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Just and F Y I... I have never traded the EUR/JPY with this method, so best of luck to with you if this works for it. I hope it does, and good luck to you!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Good job AGAIN!!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I would have been safe and passed this one up, because of the closure of the current to last 4hr candle. It recently closed in between that channel of 10 em and 20 ema. But thats me.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Well I try to get to you guys, and thanks for being their bud Psycic I hope you grabbed some good ones. I know I am off to a brutal start, but I could not fight sleep anymore and dozed off for like 4 hours. Only to wake up and miss signals again. Oh well! Like I said I will be on a rebound this week.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
raz bro what about the usd/chf trade, thats the only one appealing to me right nw...??

--- 帖子 #284 ---
are you talking about taking a trade right now? If that is the case, then I think its far exhausted it for to be valid...Or were you referring to earlier ?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I do not void a take if the ADX Yellow line is below 25 line. Based on how strong the other signals are I will time to time take a valid entry even the if the ADX line is below the 25 line. This is only used to determine strength of a trend. If it really low, then I usually use that to filter a trade. However it isn't a main filter, just helps in determining what my decisions are.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
The trade that is happening now...ya i could feel that its not going any where...

--- 帖子 #287 ---
how low can the adx be that you still consider a valid entry.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
long usdjpy at 92.10 stop and limit set ...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Lets see if it goes up from here. I see it hitting a near resistance, but I am going to pull for ya. I passed it up because I personally, just me, would like to have it touch or break the 55 line. Then shoot up!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
hey raz didnt it break the 55 line ? but your right about the resistance i will look at price action if it gets there ...

--- 帖子 #291 ---
See on my platform it never did, but yours it did. I can see where this can get a little arbitrary. Looking at your ADX green line, it was very close and pointing down, BUT I am not going to say you made the wrong entry, because overlooking everything I will say that I feel it it will take time, but I think it will get there. The overall trend is still up. After reading some economic data last week, they feel that the USD/JPY should hit 100.00 soon. However if it bounces on its way up there, let's hope that it does not go 25 back on ya.!! Let's get it

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Well if it is like below 10, then for sure I will make no entry, but if it is 13 and rising, then I would take. However it just depends on the other indicators, based upon how confirming they are. It is also when the macd histogram is bounces above and below the 0 line, this usually indicates range, but what if the signal comes right out of it? That could be your start to the trend. So lagging indicators are lagging indicators, but I use them to tell a story of where this potentially going. I would say most of my trades are below the 25 line, but if they are dead low like below the 10 line, then possibly almost 90% sure I will pass it up, but it all depends how I read the other indicators.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Or shall I say the KING, is that I see it going back up!!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
up and down up and down, for sure it will take some time hehe, but its in an major uptrend so everything is possible , the rsi crossed one more time 55 line on my chart ,hopefully a good sign ..

--- 帖子 #295 ---
first loser for today -25 .. lets see if i can catch a winner to make this loss up

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Sorry!! I hate it when that crap happens

--- 帖子 #297 ---
hehe, i dont like it either , but winners will come , this week im down -9 pips now, lets see how it will end

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Be here for another 5 1/2 hours, will have to make tonight my night. Sitting 2 in the hole, and slept through the last two signals. Well I hope to be online with you guys tonight.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Ok just got back from work. I will be sure to full time tonight, and catch hopefully all signals. The reality sucks right now, but I have faith I can turn positive by the end of tonight or by tommorrow. Good luck

--- 帖子 #300 ---
cable looks like a good signal, but on 4hr so close to possibly breaking up. Need to see if it breaks the 1.6340 area, as you can see price action has tested that area multiple times. Going to pass this signal up for now

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I passed cable too, looks more of a long on the 4h than a short. What a rally in usd/jpy slept through it..haha..

--- 帖子 #302 ---
good morning, just woke up, and now monitoring usdjpy looks like some short is forming ...

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Macd not supporting!!!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
yes thats why i didnt take it in the end

--- 帖子 #305 ---
yeah lets be careful here, I feel the euro and cable are going to be bullish, and the swissy will go bearish. The yen, well it looked like a good short, but macd histo is not confirming. So good catch guys.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
gonna take naps again, but have to try and stay and take trades tonight. you guys got any advice on a way to fall asleep fast! lol

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Count sheep? hahaha.... Have a beer?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
you can see here in this pic the Cable has a support line. To go short, I would feel comfortable if it would break that line. It has tested that line quite a bit.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
tooke euro/usd short and usd/chf long !!!! both broke their range!!!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
i took a sell on gbp usd retrace on 6330

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Out of eur/usd = +20 out of usd/chf= +8

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Going to uni. Hope to see every one making pips!! cheers! see you in 4-6 hours

--- 帖子 #313 ---
hell yea, thats how it goes cya later psycic a long fight but we won in the end, gbpusd locked in +20

--- 帖子 #314 ---
im off for a little nap , not seeing anything developing here and dont forget redflagged data in an hour , so markets can fluctuate ... so maybe better to stay out of markets

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Been having a rough time staying awake at night. Missed a lot last night, slept through most of it. Looks like you guys caught some pips. This has been a rough week for this method, because of the constant ranging. When I get home today I will back test all the results that I can see. Looks like cable is bad pair this week, just been ranging for the most part. Anyways thanks for keeping it alive and some support. Work for me this week has been busy as well.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
damn missed good trades again!!!! look at eur/usd, usd/chf....amazing!!!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
i hope sum 1 did take those trades!!!!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thats how the cookie crumblez.....!!!!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Raz bro as for ur problem of nt catching trades at work, Buy a laptop, if you have one buy a wireless internet connection the one that attaches to the laptop like a usb pendrive..i think that would sort your problem out...

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Staying true to the method, there was only one signal that I saw valid. It was the euro short. The swissy ones would have to be gut calls, but I probably would have passed em up, even though a couple hit. Even the yen looked real good, but macd filtered out any possible trades. However I did miss out on that one trade that I would have taken. These stats are pure signals that I know that I would have taken for sure. Although 'the raz method' all this week sure voided out some very nice trades, I stay true to myself when justifying my system. There had to been at least 4 more winners that the macd filtered out, but I would have passed them up.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
So tonight will be able to fight through it all. Do not have to attend work, will make it tonight. Hopefully I can break even!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
hey raz, quick question is this not a valid setup for you ? this was the only trade for me today, i took it when it retraced because it was a big bar ... thx

--- 帖子 #323 ---
what up iTrader! As far that signal goes, I am being true to myself, considering how the cable looked on the 4hr and the size of the bar I probably would have passed it up. It did retrace back up. For me to play it safe, I would not call this an invalid signal at all, but it would have been a signal that I would have passed up. I can see you used good judgement and got in on it, where was your entry if you remember? I want to clarify on my back test results, these results aren't to be taken as 'THESE ARE THE ONLY RAZ METHOD SIGNALS!!'. Anyone can see good judgement, like yourself iTrader. Taking trades using discreationary call on signals. When I back test, I scroll the screen bar for bar, and when the signal comes up...I stop and think of what I would do based upon what I see. What you see and feel is going to be sometimes different, and sometimes better I bet. So you and Psycic are doing one hell of a job, and I know with many weeks ahead, it all irons out to be positive gains. So keep the good work, and I am pleased to see that you are giving this a try. As you can see I am down 2 trades, but I know over the long haul... the more trades I catch, the better I am off. Even going back a couple days ago on the yen that you took, that ended up being a loss trade, although I could have not taken that trade(because of work) I know for a fact that I would have taken that one for sure, because it was a purely valid entry. So I documented it as the one of the losses that I missed, knowing myself that was a signal I would have jumped on. iTrader the King, we need Psycic to upload a cool pic!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
thx raz for the answer, i really do have a good feeling about the "raz method" , and i will keep on taking every signal i see for at least a month, and after that i will see the results ... every strategy needs time because the trader needs some practice to get used to it at first, and as far as im concerned we are doing a good solid job here ... so lets keep these good work coming ... thanks raz for providing your method on FF and really answering all the questions , really appreciate it. btw. im sorry if my english is a little incorrect sometimes , its not my main language its late now here, i will go and catch some sleep, will be back when europe session opens, wish you some good trades

--- 帖子 #325 ---
no need to say sorry, it cool. Far as I am concerned your english is better then mine.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hey, Raz. The EURUSD and the USDCHF both look tempting, in opposite directions of course, but each of their H4 charts say 'No". What do you see here In case this message is delivered late because it has to go through the moderation queue, the time is 10:50 pm CST.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hello peoples!!!!! Hope to see a good trades today!!!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Based on this Raz method, I am looking to create an alert by sound, as well send e-mail and text. I got this far on my research, but I have so crappy with codes and stuff. Maybe someone can help me, and set it up with alerts for the RSI to cross the 45 line(bearish) and 55 line(bullish). This page has a lot on it, and I tried messing with it, but having zero success. http://www.forex-tsd.com/setup-quest...indicator.html see if any of you can figure out what is up. Thanks

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Probably avoid sigs on cable. Does not look promising

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Just be careful, I always will not trade against the prevailing trend. You may do what feels comfortable to you, and I know week after week you will see very confirming signals come up against the 4hr trend, but I will not take em.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi all,good thread happening here.Seem to be following the method ok except for the macd and the 15 bar range.Some trades seem to be taken when the line is still well above /below the zero line and still fairly flat.Wouldnt it need to be a higher or lower trend over the direction of the line to confirm long or short trades.I know the macd is only a filter but would still like to trade by its definite confirmation.any chance of some examples being posted with arrows etc to help me understand better/thanks in advance Liney

--- 帖子 #332 ---
hi all took a long on gbpusd at 6429

--- 帖子 #333 ---
GBp/usd is in its bad stages itrader i will not take any trades in it or recommend any trades in it, until and unless a trend starts forming..i pray you dont get stopped out cz the price is very close to ur stop now!!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
SL hit here , maybe i should have waited till it retraced a bit, but had a good feeling about it .. im overall -20 for this week , lets see what will come next

--- 帖子 #335 ---
earlier I posted cable is in a bad range, so it can easily shoot up or straight down. I hope iTrader that you didnt get stopped out on that. 4hr TF shows Long mode, but it you look at PA it will show that it is ranging.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
well i cannot take away from a good feeling, but just be careful with cable right now. You will be ahead soon.!!

--- 帖子 #337 ---
thx, i didnt thought about this, just saw the signal and took it next time will be better hopefully

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Ok so I have been noticing something quite a bit lately. I have been seeing quite alot the last few months. I am going to demo it for the next few months, forward testing. I mentioned a few times before to watch out for the big candle that comes out that usually jumps the RSI from the top 60 LINE all to the 40 LINE(just an example). Which most often then not tends to retrace. So I am seeing a potential scalp with in this the original raz method. Okay with out getting two complicated, I figure the candle has to still make its massive push in the same direction of the prevailing trend. In other words if we are in LONG MODE , then the candle makes it massive jump in that bullish direction, ASSUMING THAT IT IS NOT A CLEAR RAZ SIGNAL!!! So think this out for a sec, you get a massive candle with in the realm of the original method, but of course the macd line filters it out one way or the other, or could be the adx filtering it out. Yet there is retrace on the following candle, and I almost think there is a good chance to Scalp those pips heading backwards. Now here is the questions, how many pips to go for, 5? 6? 10?, and where do we place our stop? If you look at the pic below, I have pointed out two candles that hit large while in SHORT MODE and you can clearly see they are bearish candles. They were filtered out from an original signal for the raz method, but they give a nice retrace . Well it's going to give me something more to analyze from here on, but going to have to see where the parameters may lie on this possibility. Remember me with this Raz Method, limited trades, high win rate! Of course this was not the case this week, but oh well!! LOL Let me know what you think

--- 帖子 #339 ---
on the swissy, same situation LONG MODE, big candles, and then retrace. I see the momentum on macd favors the retrace.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hey Liney, sorry I missed your post, but I intend to answer all the post promptly. Well I always say I look upto 15 bars back to paint a picture of what is happening with momentum, or strength of recent price action. It isn't the deciding factor on making a trade, but I was hoping to imply that I use the history of the macd just like I use support and resistance levels to determine possible trades. As an example, the ADX, I really don't care at all the history of the last 15 candles on that indicator. On ADX I want to see right now at close what the indicator is telling me. However on MACD for the histogram looking 15 candles back is painting picture of what happened to the momentum of this pair. The signal line just acts to smooth out the direction. Now if you fully understand the macd for what it is I never mentioned this before, but I do look for divergences as well as convergences. That is why I stress that everyone must understand all these indicators to the fullest. If you see signals come up, do not hesistate to ask. Welcome, and I hope we can help!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
still looking nasty.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
morning everyone..ok guys here is one way to filter out some bad trade..at the close of the signal candle don't enter at market order..jus place a buy or sell stop 4 or 5 pip above or below the close of the candle..this will help with some of those false signal..hope this help..trade well guys. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanks for the reply Raz,look foward to contributing,I'll be trading live micro lots,only way to really learn! Liney

--- 帖子 #344 ---
yes forward testing is the best, and micro lots are easy to learn with. You got it!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Well I can see some stuff brewing up here. Gonna keep an eye on euro short, may have to catch the it on a bounce, just like the swissy. Then yetn is creeping down there, but for the yen gotta watch that resistance line it has yet to pass the 90.80 level. If it breaks that, then I can see the Yen going long. Cable, hmm this one is tricky. My conviction on cable is that it can easily bounce right down, will have to be a very confiming signal for me to take it.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hmmm big candles, but these are against the trend.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
No trade 2day

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Idea I like so far: I used MTF moving average to add the 240m ema's to the 30m chart thus eliminating the need for it. I used a dotted dashed line to make it more in the background. Now I have a larger 30m chart with the indicator windows staying the same size as before...result is more price action space. I could zoom out 1 setting to see more chart but I like it the way it is. Steve

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Upload a chart plz...to show how it looks?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
What a crappy night and day. I actually waited up all night for nada, lol. Well, it does look like the market is going to reverse back to the original modes of where they were at. Hope full this will give me some signals.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
2day when i dint go to uni. nothing came hahaha....luck its just unpredictable!!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Like I said before I am never good at programming. however after applying the indicator, you need to adjust the properties for the bull level and bear level. However it makes an alert noise when it passed the level, after it closes which seems to be a bit late. But if you apply it to a 15 TF, it seems to give an alert before the 30 min. So let me know if this is useful or can be tweaked.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Going to be on all night. Hopefully they can knock some this range crap off, and catch some valid signals on a trend.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
cable had another big candle, that retraced again. hmm possible scalp of that candle

--- 帖子 #355 ---
lets see what we can take 2day!!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Bleh, so much range. Well hopefully we can form a trend here.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Let's do this!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
we should like chat on some messenger that ways we can communicate faster? MSN may be?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
that is good idea, that we can alert each other(in other words wake my a$$ up) for a signal. LOL!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
You took this scalp? i see that it did give some points 5-10 may be 15?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
i did, but on the demo account. I will forward test it for the next 3 to 4 months before live money is involved. took 8 pips, I am determining a 10 pip trailing stop right off the bat. Once it hit 5 pips, I shortened it down to a 5 pip trail stop. Then it closed out +8. So will have to experiment with it.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
so I am looking at something that jumps the rsi through 4 zones on a single bar, in the direction of the main trend.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
If it breaks the 90.80, I think its going to fall from there. Been testing the 90.80 area, but has not broke it. Seems that all the pairs right now are just ranging, which is not good for the raz method.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hahaha...lets wind up the day and we will fix up everything this weekend?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
everything is ranging lines are flat on 4h.....

--- 帖子 #366 ---
i am following this thread since some days. i have a question about an exit point according to the indicators on chart, if u can tell when to exit, perhaps can do an EA for that method. i prefer not to use stoploss or trailing stop(if possible). waiting your reply Thanks Anthony

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Not much went on this week, only 9 valid entries. I went back and back tested it again to be sure, and yes it is just 9 valid entries. 6 winners and 3 losers. Of course I missed out on the 6 winners, but hopefully next week we can get a good trend going so we can make some money.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
thanks for sharing the method; looks nice and simple a)trades with major trend b)has momentum and other technical logic issues i see are the ability to trade 24 hrs and/ or monitor the method other than that...it seems simple and therefore viable...will start monitoring real time...i am uncertain however on how to upload charts cheers and thanks macca

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hey thanks for the post. I am not good with making ea at all. I like to put fixed stops in for the reason that I have lost a ton of money because I allowed the market jump on me one time, and it put in me the red -245 pips one time. So having that fixed stop to me is a safety net. May I ask why you do not use stoploss orders? I try to carry my trade as far as I can, but most often then not I do what I call a trade and forget . Let it ride, and I feel confident that the system will either hit +25 or -25. If you know anyone that is good with ea, I would encourage them to develop one for this, but as for me I am not good with ea's at all. Let me know if you have any other questions Anthony.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Yeah I know, this is the true challenge for this system is that you are only going to catch so many signals, at very few times per week. If the pairs are in a low strength trends or stuck in ranging motion, then this method does not produce well, like it did last week. However I try my best to take approiate times away from trading...like sleep;work;hiking;out to eat...things of that nature. This usually happens at low volatile times, usually non EURO/UK/USA session. However as you can see from this thread, that I will take every valid entry, during anytime. Through probability I will come out ahead. Missing signals will evidently be the most costly aspect to me. I think Psycic put it well in an earlier post..... if you treat this like a full time job then it will be like having a full time career... something like that. So as you can see on a day to day basis I will be on as much as I can and I will take live trades, and give my perception as to what my basis and convictions are when taking live trades. However thank you for posting, and I hope that you do well in your forex adventures, and if you want any part of the raz method, feel free to give it a try on either demo or micro lots untill you feel comfortable and I will always be here like some others to help assist or give our best opinions.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Ok this will be the third week, we can only hope that we have some nice trends that are going to happen all week. I am looking to get two my second month goal by the end of this month.

Typical start of the week, no valid signals as of last night. I am currently at my work, and will be here for the next 8 hours. If any signals do come up, I will back test them and post them here. See you guys tonight

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Raz, would you have taken this trade?

I just got home from work. I just looked back on this trade, and according to my system, and would have taken it. HOWEVER it is a bank holiday for the JPY, so gotta becareful when taking a trade that the economy is on holiday, the volatility is going to be very off. Knowing myself, if no holiday then I would have taken it, only to lose out on this trade.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thanks, Raz. I thought i read it correctly, based on the chart, but you are right...should have paid attention to "Holiday".

--- 帖子 #379 ---
no problem bro, i have had my misfortunes when taking trades on holidays, only to wonder, why is the pair just sitting there. Yeah bank holidays are very tricky. But good job catching that signal..

Pass this trade up, histogram flipping the 0 line, and the adx yellow line was low. I used judgement and non high trading session, to pass the trade up

+25 pip on short of cable, at 1.6365

as you can see from pic below, pefect valid entry short, and it hit +25 within 20 mins.

I expect a big retrace on the cable once the session opens, but it is going to be in a downard trend for the most part.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
In the 4hr charts, if there isnt a strong trend, then it produces very limited, or no valid entries at all. So far this week there were only two valid entries, that hit. Although I made a point to pass up the yen earlier because of holiday, it did have a valid sig the next day. So slow week, but no losers.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Does the usd/chf meet the criteria for a short at gmt 5 unsure about the macd.anyone care to comment?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I do not see a possible valid signal, because the macd filters it out. This has been one of the slowest weeks for this method. So much range between the majors, and this never goes well for this method. So many signals are filtered out. I hoping tonight we can see a strong trend form therefore we can hop in and grab some trades.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Let's keep an eye on cable here. Big jump on RSI, usually means a retrace on it, and which it did. If we watch closely we can get in maybe in a few candles, for a possible long.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Very weak trend according to the ADX, but I took a valid sig short. LIVE TRADE: Short 1.0164

--- 帖子 #398 ---
During my live messenger we partly discussed taking the euro long. Here is the possible entry. I was about to take it, but I took the consideration that the macd signal line was still pointing down thus filtering any possible trade. However if you did take it, it did look like a good signal after all, and it definetly hit +25 pips. Even though there was a news break out coming up, I choose to not trade this system based around news, simply because the countless hours that I back tested this system and made my adjustments never taking news times or signals when back testing. Here is the pic of the potential trade, if you took it, you would have been fine. first pic is Euro long, that I filtered out, so I will not count this towards my stats. second pic is the trade I did take short on swissy, and you can see that it is about halfway there from hitting the TP.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
well as I was posting that last pic, the swissy made its break south and closed me out for a shot +25 pips. CURRENT STATS: WEEKLY TRAIL: 3 WINS (2 MISSED) 0 LOSSES (0 MISSED) EARNED THIS WEEK $9.52 MONTHLY TRAIL: STARTING BALANCE $395.92 MONTHLY GOAL $484 CURRENT BALANCE $405.44

Hi Raz &amp; Psycic, Hope you guys are fine. I have been watching the market! Have earned few quids and lost too. Is there anything we can do to catch the signal little early as most of the time I can see it's a bit late when I catch a signal once the RSI crosses 55 line. and I'm only opening trade when I can glue to my PC as I found catching 25 pips are not always easy, may be my luck is not that good! I'm sorry if I sound too foolish! Believe me, I'm trying hard to learn and get into discipline. Good luck to all my friends...

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yeah it is tough. I try not to watch all the candles all day long, or I would go insane. however what I do most of the time, considering I am only interested in the close of a candle, not the open;mid;high;low, but just the close. So what I do is I use a little alarm timer that goes off 3 mins before each close of a candle. That 3 mins allows me enough time to analyze if I do have a trade or nothing. Sometimes based on price action I know that I will not be able to get any sort of a valid entry for the next 3 to 4 candles. Then I walk away and do something else. For example if it is 03:00, and I know that I can be away for 3 candles then I put the alarm at 04:26 to go off. That way I am not starring at my monitors are freakin night. If the volatility is kicking up, then I usually set my alarm to off every hour, an example, 03:00 to set it at 03:57, or even sooner at 03:27. This sounds tideous, but that is how I have been doing it. I have not been able to make an alarm system to go off when a potential trades is coming up. The only other thing that I can recommend is to join us on windows live messenger, where we talk pretty much of what is coming up as a possible trade right before they happen.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Off to work, I will be on ff if anyone has questions. take it easy.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
An hour and half to go.... . Lets hope we can have trend contiuation tonight so we can make some pips!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Looking back, looks like there was only one valid signal that occured. Although it retraced back up, it wouldn't have hit a stop loss, but right now it would be sittin in the red -4 pips. However it was valid and I would have taken it but I was at work, so I need to see where this one will end up. Stop loss is 1.0183 Take profit is 1.0135 Spread is calculated, so lets see where this one will end it, because even though it is during a low volatile times, I still take all valid signals, like this one.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Ok with the euro session about to open up, I can see a possible Long on euro and cable. Short possibility on the swissy, although if you took that earlier position with the swissy your trade would still be active at this point. So going to keep monitoring that trade. Lets grab those valid sigs. Yen is lookign bearish but we are in LONG MODE so, look for the reversal and get in with a valid sig north if that is the case. Careful to watch how the 4hr charts close on the yen.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Here was a valid raz method signal. I see the resistance at 1.6622, but I feel the cable is uptrend and will break it. Stops are in and here we go!! Live Trade: Got in on close of this candle Long 1.66156 Eek its just dropped, to -10 pips! No worries, just a retracement, we will see where this will go.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
had my trigger finger on euro, for a long, but the last second it closed losing momentum on histogram. So by rule I had to pass the possibility of a trade.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
well now you can see the spark upwards on euro. Almost got in twice, but did not get good confirmation on the macd. However right now it would be +20 pips for sure. Cable is just sitting on break even point right now. the swissy trade that I have been monitoring from what would have been a valid sig, is still live and showing now +5 pips.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Euro and swissy have too big of a major jump on the RSI to make this a valid entry. I would presume a posssible retrace.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hey Raz if you can hold that GBP you are in for a next 15min i think you will be fine.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
lets hope so, I am getting tired. I want this trade to close so I can get some sleep

you right..i am also in a long position but it seem like everyone is on the sideline waiting for the us NFP to come out..let's tough it out alittle more and see.

i am long eure/jpy..i have been in this trade for over an hour and i am still at -2..i can't make a pay check like this ..i am in at 134.83 but i will hold it alittle longer and see..what is your position look like?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
it is bouncing up and down, now its -5 pips

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Just move in profit +2..you know what Raz it's friday and these trade might not hold to the full take profit target area so if you get in some profit take what you can get and give it a break..it's gonna be crazy from here on out untill after the US NFP comes out..so if or when you get in profit no matter how small protect and don't let your trade run back in a lost..jus take what you can get and run.

It's trying to do something now +6..wow this is crazy

--- 帖子 #420 ---
just stopped out -25. Its ok, it was a valid sig, which I have no problems with. Now I can sleep

Just one of those days..it was a good setup jus on the wrong day..(NFP )..i am gonna take caution and clsoe this trade at +8..better take something than nothing..get some rest Raz and we will get them later.

going to week 4 of this. No one really knows what week this will be, but I can only hope we have some strong trends build up. Simply the stronger the trend, the more signals we get. Last week was dismal to say the least, low amount of sigs, and yes it turned out to be a wash week for valid sigs. 3 winners and 3 losers. Althought I only caught one winner and one loser, I am right back where I started. I will once again wait closer to the open of the euro session and see where this shapes up. I am hoping to net 11 winning trades this entire month, and I have 3 weeks to make ground. So let us see what we have this week, and hopefully we can bank on some solid trades.

Looking back from last night I realized once again with my luck I missed valid sigs, that did hit their TP.

Live Trade: Short USD/JPY 89.92 With my dumb luck it will rally on me. Oh well I feel it will drop again. It was a slight valid sig, boucned quite a bit on the 0 line on macd, but I feel confident that I need to grab every valid sig, see where this one will go.

Just flew off the radar! Well I think this is exactly why the forex market is so brutal. That spike is indication that the Market Makers, are trying to correct position and throw the specutalors off. That just took out a bunch of stop losses, billions$$$ of dollars gone!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yup..you right..alot of trader crying right now with that spike .

--- 帖子 #428 ---
With the bank holiday coming up on wednesday, whenever that time is on your schedule. Expect volatility to freeze through out.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Passed on this sig, the RSI had a big jump from candle to candle. If it breaks the 89.65 area, then I expect a bearish run, but it has just been testing the support area of 89.70. Do not want to get caught in rut here waiting for a break out.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
For those who would have taken that close of candle as valid sig, this is why I passed it up. I have state before a big jump on RSI in direction of the current trend usually indicates a retrace. Look at pic below to see the reasons why this position short is too risky.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
as you can see right after I post that pic, we have a bullish candle position at 89.76

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi Raz: nice lesson on that Uj. We still need to keep all our technical analysis skills in mind with this method. I see a good 25 pip win on Gu long a few hours ago before I awoke this morning. Steve

--- 帖子 #433 ---
hey steve, well slept through the euro long and the swissy short sig. I will post once I can get my eyes open.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Live Trade: Long Cable 1.6714 VERY VERY Risky, but hey I felt good, trading with the momentum. On 4hr charts all closes are above the 10 and 20 ema. I feel that there will be a slight pull back, but I think this can fly up and hit some positive pips. Let's see where this goes. Yes of course it was a valid sig.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
These happened a few hours ago, of course I slept through them. Both valid, and the euro already hit its TP, but the swissy hit +21 pips, would not have had hit +25 yet.

beating my head in. I need to get some luck on these sigs, just missing so many good ones, and catching only a few, and of course the losing one of the week. Keep on trading....

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I am going to post each individual sigs from early this morning till now, and give my input. I just got home from work, and I am going back to validate any possible sigs. In the pic below this is totally a valid sig, but considering the bank is closing in next 2 hours I would have passed it up. I do not expect much volatilty or trends with any of the majors.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Cable, actually produced one winner right after I left for work, and it hit its TP easily. The second signal was voided because of the bouncing on MACD 0 line, and getting close to end of business day, and leading to tommorrow as a bank holiday. So second sig was a no go for me.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
There were two valid crossed, but were voided out by signal line on MACD, and so neither were counted for valid sigs.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Well if you were reading from my eariler post, which was post #430, I showed you a significant reason why I passed up on the USD/JPY short.... Can you guess what it is? It is that solid support line, right around the 89.70 to 89.74 posistions. Even thought I never mentioned before in the raz method support lines and resistance, it is crucial to never let go of Forex Basics 101 so to speak. You should always be looking out for significant support areas and resistance areas, no matter what method you trade. Yes looking at the pic you can clearly see a ton of valid entries, but you need to realize that if the 89.70 to 89.74 area is not going to be broken with a candle closed through it, then more then likely that support is going to hold solid. In this case it was quite obvious it did. Soooo to make any profitable trade, you would need a cushion of at least +20 pips towards that support area, or do not take a trade at all. Forex Basics 101, never forget them it should be in your arsenal at all times!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Man I should have better stats then this, but one thing is good to say for this week. If you traded the raz method in the purest form and caught all the signals.... this would have been a good start to the week. It will take me maybe a month for me to adjust my body fatigue to stay up all night to catch most of the signals. Anyhow great start to the week. I will not trade tonight nor tommorrow in observance of the holiday. I will probably eye ball the market on Friday a little, but probably pass up any good sigs.

Text Book Forex Basics 101, yen closed passed the 89.7- to 89.74 area, and then it sold off. I did not take it, but if you were looking at it and caught that drop it sailed off for some nice pips.

Hi all just did my first raz trade at 7.30 gmt short on the G/U, it went for 20 pips then I took profit,finished up going for about 28 but Im happy with this for a start,thanks Raz http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif Liney

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Well I have not traded the past two days and most likely not tonight, because of holiday. However when I get back from work I will back test any potential valid sigs. Good job, and good luck.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Well 5th week going in, with a holiday next week it only seems fitting that this weel should be a full time week. I have had missed almost all good sigs, but have not changed anything since originally starting this method a month ago. I will continue to trade in the purest form, and hopefully with adjusting my work schedule I can catch the sigs all night long. My stats show a loss at this point, but for the most part I am not dissapointed knowing well that all signals that I back test are valid sigs that I would confidently take. Last week I did not back test any sigs before and after holiday, because that is what I stated how I would trade this method, there for the stats sit at 6 wins and 1 loss. Of course I did see 4 more signals go down and hit, but I will not count them as valid trades. So good luck to all trading, hope to see everyone make pips.

Looks to be slow start of a week like a typical Monday. Staying away from Yen at the moment, dont see much reason to short yet. However the rest are way out of wack right this moment to even trade anything right now. Will sleep a few hours and check back in

Live Trade: Long Cable 1.6848 conviction to me is still Long, and I believe it will break the resistance and head north. This likely looks like a bad trade, but it was valid sig. Because of the jumpy ness of the cable, I set a limit order 5 pips back of close candle, and it pulled back and triggered it. Well I hope I can start the week off with a winner. Well right when I posting this, I just got whipped out. LOL, start the week of with a bust. Should have listened to Psycic, strong dollar.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
No issues bro. more trades to come!!

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Well what do you know, of course when I come back from work there would be a valid sig that hits +25 pips. Here it is the cable. Just my luck they seem to happen when I am not available to trade, but I will continue to strive forward. I hope that I can eventually get a good luck wave and catch most signals that are winners, but this is a valid sig, and it does hit.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Live Trade: Short 89.27 This is valid sig, I see the pair is ranging, but hit has made strong lows so I will wait to see if it takes is chance and heads short. Of course it bounced up on me, but I will take all valid sigs at all times of the day, especially if it Yen during Japanese session. This may take time to hit, but I have all night.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
4 hours later and we are half way there. I feel confident this will break clean through. Finally sitting on +green pips

--- 帖子 #456 ---
well sittin on +13 pips, but this trade has been drawn out for so long that if it did bottom out, I dont want to walk away with a loss. Moved SL to +5 pips for right now. giving it about 8 to 9 pips to make its move down.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
finally, but worht it, hours later +25 pips on YEN

Well I am making it official, I am not changing anything in the Raz Method, except for that I am going to add the USD/CAD now. I have been testing it for the last three weeks about 5 months back. I also forward tested it on demo, and it looks like works well with this method. So nothing else changes as for entries and exits, but just going to go live with this pair. I also will be looking at the NZD/USD and AUD/USD going forward, but haven't concluded to go live with these pairs. I want to clarify before, I never said that trading this method on any other pair would not work, I just have not given the ample time to test them. However I am about 90% sure about the USD/CAD for me to go forward with it along with the 4 majors.

Passing on the Yen short sig. That is a strong support line at 88.85 - 89.00. I definetly do not feel that it will break through it. Of course I can be wrong, but it has test that are multple times this month and it has not broken through it. I should have taken this trade, it did hits TP after all, regardless of the support line. My own fault

--- 帖子 #463 ---
There is one valid sig that happened while I was at work. Yen short. The Yen entry short last night that I passed up on did however hit its TP. So I need to be more discipline and take my trades when all confirming is up. Right now this trade is still open right now, but not sure if it is going to hit.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
well that yen short is a winner. Entry point would be 88.92 and it just hist 88.70, for at least a +20 pip hit. So another good hitter, so this week there would have been 3 seperate yen shorts, that all hit TPs, and were part of making new lows for the month. Bummed I missed out on two of them, but once again taking purely valid sigs, disregard news siginals, and you have winners.

hey raz and others, i'm glad your still following the method and still posting. me for my part i'm still monitoring the raz method, and demoing when i find some time, but i'm more concentrating on my live account with price action and S/R trading. just wanted to stop by and wish you a nice weekend. bye iT

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Good to hear from iTrader, it has been sometime. Yes I will continue to post as well continue to document the trades. As it sits week after week this method has produced mainly winners over losers, and I have had the worst luck being available to catch the valid sigs. However after adjusting my work schedule a couple of weeks ago I have adjusted my sleeping and timing so I can be up most of the volatile nights so I can try and catch most trades. As it sits I have missed practically all the winning trades,even though they are still hitting winners. So I hope through good discipline and consistency I will start to get on that winning track.

Euro was close, in taking it long, but I passed it because the signal line was pointing down, ironicaly I am short swissy which means I should safely long the euro, but see where it goes later on.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Uj short now +10; macd signal line not good but histo bar closed lower; rsi was impressive coming from above 60 with good sloope down past 45; ADX was ok with D- moving up but ADX sideways; took a chance; its looking good. Steve

--- 帖子 #488 ---
looks good, I have made a ton of pips of USD/JPY shorts the last two weeks, day by day, it should hit for ya!

--- 帖子 #489 ---

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I'm using an EA that locks in 23 pips so locked in and happy.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
saw it touch 88.19, so bro. A winning trade to brighten your spirits!

--- 帖子 #492 ---

USD/CAD + 25 PIPS hit

Really like this easy and simple system. I have setup my own version for some of these trades for my live trades and am so far setup using Usd/Yen, Eur/Usd, Usd/Chf, Nzd/Usd, Aud/Usd, and Eur/Gbp. Are there any other recommended pairs I have missed? I really like all the above pairs.. I did not add Usd/Cad just because I didn't like the trades I saw as much. Do you mind if I post a couple of my trades here later in the week? thanks! Brian

--- 帖子 #497 ---
welcome Brian, by all means help yourself to posting all you want this is a open forum. As for the currencies that I trade are EUR/USD GBP/USD USD/JPY USD/CHF USD/CAD and I am demoing the AUD/USD and NZD/USD. So far they follow this method realatively well, but I need to demo them for a month or two before I go live with them. Thanks for stopping by, and post anything you like

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Awesome.Thanks Raz, much appreciated and thank you for this thread as well Brian

--- 帖子 #499 ---
No Problem Brian, Euro Just closed on a quick slip, but +23.4 pips, so thats good for me! Now I just need the Swissy to make its way to +25 pips

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Well it looks like the Swissy is going to take a few more hours. So I have my SL set to +5 pips, at this point it has plenty of time to make TP, so I rather walk away with something om this trade. I still have TP for +25 pips. Going to nap out for an hour and catch some sleep, but be back in a few. Looks like nothing else is jumping right out at the moment.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hmm Swissy went from +12 to +16, I guess that is progress, yay. Still have my stop set to + 5 pips, and tp to +25 pips. Gonna have to wait this one out

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Live Trade: Long Euro 1.4992 Valid entry, and I look for another +25 pips long. Swissy still open, and its just hovering around + 16 pips, got close to +22 pips, but I feel that it will hit +25, so I will give it more time

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Closed it out at + 22 pips, took long enough, but took the +22 and ran with it, and now the Euro is live for long.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I knew it would happen finally that I would be able to catch the sigs. Well so far today I have had 4 trades, three winners and one open which is -2 pips right now. Will look for my sigs through out the night.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Just got back from walking my dogs outside, and sure enough I get back and the swissy gievs another short sig, but I missed out on it. Oh well, at least my euro long is holding through +19 pips right now, nvm just closed out at +20, oops set the TP wrong I guess that is what happens when you trade and drink Bourbon + Coke, math goes right the window. Well +20 pips it is

--- 帖子 #506 ---
So far tonight one missed valid sig, and let us see where this Swissy short may go. Sort of bummed out I missed it but, hey cant be here all the time

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Well I hate to say that I made it a point to take all valid sigs, and sure enough I step away for a sec and I miss one tonight, but good news is that I nailed the my last 4 winners.

No, nothing wrong, but as a Junior Member your posts need approval from a moderator to be published, so this takes sometime to be approved and published, but after like 10-20 posts you normally become a normal member and postings will be published instantly.

Looks great !! I knew you will hit a winning streak, i hope it will go on for a long time

--- 帖子 #512 ---
raz, would you be so kind and say some words again on your entry timing? Especially in combination with the RSI? (if macd and adx is fine, do you take all trade, as long as its above/below 55/45?) And what about the Candle itself, do it has to close above/below the EMA3 or just ok to close on it or near the EMA20 ? Thank you

As many of you may not know but I am on windows live messenger, but that will not stop me from posting here in the forum. However with the live messenger I will be able to...I guess alert a possible up coming trade, and it is more upto the second. I try to post what I am going to take in the messenger, and of course the forum is a lagging response on my trades. I want to say again that I am sorry I did not post the pics from the last two nights of trading, but I will continue to do it some more, and show you where and why I took trades. However if you like to join the messenger and leave and go as you please my e-mail on windows live messenger is: tamarraq@hotmail.com Just make sure you unblock your self or unblock me so you can easily be invited to the room.

GJ goldnen! well tonight I will trade through the uk session, which will probably do it for the rest of the week. As I posted earlier that I do not trade after sessions after holidays. So this will be the last night, it is good to make a lot of ground in the past two days with this method, as I should have in the past few weeks. However I am starting to see a good amount of interest in this method as I continue to trade it in its purest form. So as of now there has been no changes or adjustments to the methods, just that I added the USD/CAD to the current majors that I trade. I will be on pretty much all night on windows live messenger where you can freely drop in and chat about pretty much anything, and share ideas. Make Some PIPS!

Raz, Thanks for the sys, I have read through it is a good sys. I think is better to have 20-25 pip winning trade than a lose trade. I will add u to my messager now.

Going to put up my forex gloves for now, holiday is on, and I see the market flat. see eveyone next week and, hope we can start the month off with a good pip jump!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Wow had a great night and morning focusing mainly on my setup of this system Raz... five great trades last night and two this morning and I missed a couple trades.. all in all I captured lots of hot pips on holiday enjoying trading a ton more than I used to with my fast paced trading setups I was doing. Have a great weekend and see you next week! Brian

--- 帖子 #524 ---
HOLY INDICATORS, BATMAN! Do you trade on a 24 inch screen? Glad you got some pips!

--- 帖子 #525 ---
i like it that people are giving intrst to this method of trading....i love it personaly....!!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I actually live by my trading... each trade is the real deal so my setup has to work for me. Its my version of the exact same trade Raz is doing, just allows me to put more on the table each time and get where I need to be each week. That's what its about everyone, finding the mix, time frame, indicators, trade level, MM, that works for you and focus on that. Find your niche and rock with it All the best... happy pips! Brian

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Will be back tonight, and for some of you early in the morning. However I hope to see much of you guys online here or via windows live messenger. As you all know after thursday I did not trade the rest of the week. I took the week off, and now I am back tonight to start a fresh week. I am currently at work right now, and I do not have access to my charts as of yet now, but when I get online I willl address all questions or other stuff, good luck this week and hope many you guys last week finished the week off with positive pips!

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hello guys, lets hope we have a good week, I got a valid sig on USD/JPY short here. I know it is before the euro session, but I have had good luck with shorting the yen the past few weeks so I went in and took it. Sitting on -5 pips right now, but I think the USD/JPY is still in a bearish channel. So got my TP and SL set, looking for +25 Live Trade: Short USD/JPY 86.62

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Well I goofed up on this trade, the yellow 3ema didnt pass the purple 20 ema, so this is actually a chance trade now. Gotta rely on hope that this hits, shouldnt have taken it to be honest, but once I am in, I am in. So see where this goes. I totally missed that analysis.

--- 帖子 #530 ---

Well so if you took the correct valid sig on the second arrow in the pic, you still would have hit +25 pips regardless. It was destiny , anyhow I got in on the first arrow, but the second arrow was the valid sig, and it did hit as well. So either way a valid entry all in all

--- 帖子 #532 ---
couple quick 25 pip profits. Those dot-dash lines are RAZ's MTF 4h ma's on the 30m chart so I don't have to look at the 4h chart so often. Thank you RAZ! Steve

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Nice pips sir!! cheers!!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
This is exactly what makes me happy, to see someone make the proper adjustment for themselves and run with it, wow gj on EUr/JPY, happy to see you nail +pips !!!

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Catch you guys later!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Kinda jumped in when I got back to my desk but it appears to be a valid signal that lost. Appears to stopped me out by a pip or two, now going back down to pay. Since it has been going sideways I'm thinking I should have waited for rsi to rise above 60, then close below 45 for entry to show some momentum. Any ideas how to improve this? Here's the chart.... Steve

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I am going to look at this when I get back from work. I have noticed sometimes on the bigger candles that form, there usually a pull back to help entering from 5 to 7 pips back, but I would have to see where the charts sit when I get home. Sorry to here you lose here bro, but there is one thing I have learned from trading this method, that if you take every valid sig, there will always be more winners vs losers.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
As I mentioned earlier I was going to post my analysis to the USD/CAD that Steve took, and I pointed out the reasons why I would have not taken a trade. This is no way any means saying that I am a better trader, or saying that Steve made a wrong decision. I respect Steve in his decision making and I believe he an excellent trader. This is just my opinion

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Thanks RAZ for explaining this better to me in the chat. I will try to remember what you teach me. It is much appreciated and always welcomed. Steve

the euro and swissy both pinching up on the 4hr charts, indicates range, and who knows which direction. So going to wait till session opens before I make a move. Everything looking real nasty right now, and all pairs seems to be stuck in a range right now.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Well I was way too tired to stay up last night, but looks like after the market squeeze, when all the emas on a 4hr pinch together, usually sends the pairs flying one direction or the other. I did miss a valid Swissy short, and if you wanted too you could have take the euro long, but it wasn't quite valid, but both would have hit +25 pips each. So hopefully a strong trend can form tonight and I will be on all night to trade. Good luck to all, and take it easy.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Here is the valid sig that I missed last night sleeping, it was pratically the only valid sig that did hit. The euro long was possible, but never touched or broke the 55 line, so I am not going to count as valid sig.

Live Trade: All valid as pic'd below short USD/CAD 1.0442

--- 帖子 #544 ---
This was a little of a gut feeling along with valid entries. I noticed that euro and swissy both produced slight but valid entries, but since they were weaker candles I wanted to get in at least 2 to 3 pips back of the close, and I did two candles later. The macd sig line finally flatened out for both, and it was a hard one to call, but that is forex for you it is all about making tough decisions in a short time. LONG EUR/USD at 1.5090 SHORT USD/CHF at .9988 with still short on USD/CAD open in the pics below are the circles of the valid candles closes, but I waite for a bit of a fall back to jump in.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
all three live trade are in the red, oh no! oh well that is trading for ya

--- 帖子 #546 ---
MACDs (signal lines) didn't confirm USDCHF short and EURUSD long trades (using FXDD, too), though they were close calls. But I agree with USDCAD trade.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
you are correct, sometimes I jump the gun a little early, and I maybe paying for it, but it looks like the dust is settling, and hopefully the euro and swissy can both head in the correction direction.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Yea Raz,eur/us have been ranging all night and now is seem like it wanna break to the down side.You right that's trading for you..don't sweat it though another one is right around the corner for you,good luck buddy .

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Re. USDCAD trade, do you put your stop at 1.0467 + spread OR just 1.0467?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
yeah, definetly paying for it, euro is going to stop out shortly as well as the other two, my mistake by jumping the gun on the macd sig lines. Sometimes I get impatient since I haven't taken a trade for so long, and I fall right back into my own mistakes and taka a trade too soon. It is a hard lessoned learned.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
since it a short, it will be 'ASK' to 'BID' that includes the spread. So in other words, the bid price will close me out, if it happens. It is about 3 to 5 pips away from hitting, just letting it ride to see where it lands. All three are still alive, but barely. I should have known better to pass these up.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Yes, the USD/CAD loss as well EUR/USD. Swissy about too, but it is 5 pips away.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Well the swissy bringing light to my trade, hopefully it can cancel out one of my losses.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Doesn't this always seem to happen as soon as your stop loss hit price seem to turn and go the other way..funny Raz seem like the euro/us is going back up..oh well s""t happen.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
yes it does, and I know I have tight stops, some people in the past have mentioned before to me about having tight stops. However I believe in risking exactly what you want to make, because if I were to risk 2:1 R:R then if I had a loss, it would mean that I would have to win twice to make it up. If I lose once then it is just one more winner to make it up. Yeah I know it is just the market being brutal thats all, it always hits my stop loss then goes back to be a good trade. But hey that is trading for you, and even when I lose it is just a reminder that the second I trade from my rules and setups, it will cost me. Like the earlier post from Black eagle, he mentioned the mac D line was still pointing in the wrong direction, should have payed more attention to it.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
since the USD/CHF is alone on this one, I moved the SL to -10 pips now, not going to give it a chance to rally up again. TP still +25 pips, if it picks up good momentum I will go for more pips. But for now, gotta wait, and now I am going to full tilt poker to play some poker.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Therefore, you should add USDCAD trade only to your monthly statistics as it was the only valid signal out of three you took this morning.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
will do, thank you for keeping me in check! I am still going to count it towards my account balance just the money part, because it is a loss of real money, but will make a side note as for valid entries on 'winners or losers' since both the other trades were judgement calls.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Good Job Brian, definetly good to see you made very good pips. As for me last night, just a lessoned learned on sticking with the system, and which I got so impatient last night I took a trade for the sake of taking a trades, and it bit me again, well $h|t happens, and now back to the basics of the system.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
GBPUSD is in long mode since Dec. 1st and what you posted has nothing to do with RAZ method (including all those other indis on your chart). Please post RAZ related trades not to distract, otherwise nobody cares what you do on your own.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Raz, what do you think about long EURUSD and short USDCHF trades at the close of current bar, they seem valid signals.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I passed both them up for now, everything lines up but the 3 ema was still above the 20 ema(on USD/CHF) and same with euro(3ema below the 20 ema). So going to watch and see if I can get in on a pull back. Although right now it looks like it is going good if you got in.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
At the close of 1:30 bar on FXDD, 3 ema was below 20 for both pairs (1.0009 vs. 1.0010 for USDCHF and 1.5060 vs. 1.5056 for EURUSD). Thanks for the reply.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Loonie looking good for me, definetly going to give this another short try, it it stays lined up like that.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Agree, but at the moment both 3 and 20 ema are the same at 1.0490, but we have 20 minutes for bar close, watching at the moment.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
And there was AUDUSD long signal at the close of 1:00 bar, but not trading yet as you are demoing this pair and also we have Retail Sales data due now.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Passed this one for now as 3 was above 20.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
this sucks, I have to power down my cpu now, adding a new vid card, and installing 2 more monitors, but going to monitor those three pairs. Being disciplined here, had to pass the loonie up the 3 ema was still above the 20 ema, looking to get in later.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I already talked to Raz about this when I first found this thread. This is absolutely the Raz method if you paid attention at all you would easily see that. Rsi cross with macd and ema 3/20 as well as adx confirmation... made personal by me as Raz said he wanted people to do. I wish you all the best.. good day Brian

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Blackeagle I am sorry I did not read that far back when you posted this. As for me I am personally trading the method by the original rules and have not change it, well yesterday I did bend it a bit and it cost me, however if anyone feels the need to adjust it to their own personal settings I am fine with that, and if they care to share it by all means I open to it. However I want to make it clear that I personally am not changing anything and I will post all my trades and stats. So if Golden1 wants to add extra indicators, by all means go right ahead. However if anyone has a question that purtains to his adjustments then I believe he is obligated to explain. So to all fellow traders, please trading is a risky business, as you can see I just got my butt kicked last night by not following my own rules, but make sure that you are comfortable to a trading method before you role with it.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Thanks for making it clear.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
possible short coming up again. This time looke like it is closing the correctly

--- 帖子 #573 ---
My EMA 5 and 10 on H4 are the same, both 1.0488, so I'll pass it if closes like that. By the way, EURUSD long hit +25.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Nope not this time around, it pulled back again

--- 帖子 #575 ---
yeah euro did, the swissy is still sitting in the mid. That is how it it is sometimes.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
well looking back the AUD/USD did hit +25, so I give it till mid January then I will start taking live trades, but so far its has been 4 winners and 1 loser so far on AUD/USD

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Agree, it is a good trending pair.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi Raz I am still confuse with the 4 H chart signal, I got in this trade yesterday buying GU based on a confirmation from the 4 H chart, This trade hit my SL first before moving to the right direction, I noticed that the 4 h was retracing but all the moving averages showing strong trend , Please help ,Thanks

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hello Tazzam, First of all I hope you are demoing this before trading real money like I am. 4hr charts just indicates one thing, we are either in LONG MODE or SHORT MODE. Looking at your chart the MACD easily filters that signal out, since the macd line is clearly pointing down this will void that entry out. I hope this clears it up, but continue to ask if it isn't.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Ohh ,,,you go by the line not by the wave strength, Yes the line was pointing down but the wave was little higher than the previous one .

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I take both into account, for the histogram I need to see an increase in momentum(LONG MODE of course) and I need the mac d signal line to favor the direction or be flat. Yes, purely systematical. This is the 7th week I have been live trading my method, and there has been weeks where there are a good amount of valid sigs, and some where there are pratically none. However upto now there has been far more winners then losers, but there are times where I find myself just wanting to trade for the sake of just trading, and yesterday was an example of it costing me money. I had 3 losses when I should have had just one, but anyhow if you stick the original rules and methods and get comfortable with it, the method will continue to produce winners over losers.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
My computer is down for now, but I saw there were two long entries that were both valid for the euro and the cable. Both which hit +25 each. Leaving the stats as. I will have my monitors setup tommorrow early and be ready to go at it soon.

Raz, your stats were 2 W and 3 L before today. Today we had two EURUSD, one USDCHF and one GBPUSD winners which bring your total to 6 W and 3 L, for your info.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I certainly can relate, I have lost lumps of money. Also I have quit twice on forex, but now I take a systematic approach to trading. The particular reasons of my loss was my emotions and making snap judgements, but hey I guess if I haven't lost in the past I would not have made it thus far. They always talk about only 2% of Forex Traders really make it, but I really think that the 98% that fail are those who either; rushed into it too soon; lack of education in money management or RRR; lost money early and never stuck with it; etc........ I too was in that 98% realm trying to get rich real fast on forex, but really I lost so much it was disheartening to see so much of hard worked money go down the drain. I had zero discipline and no patience. Couple nights ago it shows what impatience can do, and it cost me again..just reminder how sticking to rules can be so valuable. I do not claim to be a forex pro by any means, but now I understand fully when a few years back when I was losing money that many other traders kept telling me the same thing.... be patient, stick to your method, don't break your own rules.... and now I can only appreciate the reality of what veteran traders were trying to teach me. I apologize, I kind of went off on a slant there, but it is reality with me when I see others have lost money in this, because I have been down that road. I hope everyone give it enough of a chance to realize that this can be profitable.

I have customized some indicator for this system...include alert when RSI more than 55 or less than 45... the first picture is before interface...and the second picture is after interface...

--- 帖子 #600 ---
that is awesome! I will have to take a look at that when I get back. I was out all weekend, but will be on live later tonight. Looking back I notice there were only one possible trade and that was the loonie, however it did have a big jump on RSI, so typically I would have probably passed it up. However nothing else lined up, but be live today. Nice work Stewart, maybe when we get a chance you can explain to me how to read some of the other indicators, considering they are the same but how to correctly visuailize them

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Well I just got home from work, and it looks like I missed an entry for short on the loonie. I have an order entry to short now if it rallys back up and gives me and opportunity to get back in. So hopefully I hit it goes back up high enough, hopefully not too high. The pic shows where the valid entry is...

--- 帖子 #602 ---
thx Raj... To read the indicator, just follow the picture below.. (please download the indicator again...I updated some component)...

--- 帖子 #603 ---
have to cancel that order, the USD/CAD when +20 pips on that short of entry point. So now I wait to see what I can pick up going forward.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
cool, does the RSI give a sound signal alert when it crosses the 55 line or 45 line, when it crosses instantly or when it crosses then closes on it? I had an earlier sound system that did this but, it would only give me a sound alert when it crosses RSI 55 or 45 line when it closed, so sort of useless.

Here current stats thus far. CURRENT STATS: WEEKLY TRAIL: 1 WINNERS (1 MISSED) 0 LOSSES (0 MISSED) EARNED THIS WEEK $0.00 MONTHLY TRAIL: STARTING BALANCE $499.83 MONTHLY GOAL $644.20 CURRENT BALANCE $462.62

Hi Raz, What do you think about the possible GBPUSD short trade? Do you think MACD was too flat for the last 15-20 bars? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
it is a connecting candle, and yes the macd both line. See hot is closes, but definetly. The macd looking 15 candles back is flat, and showed bearish momentum before, so definite if it closes valid

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Then again that is why I trade on closed candles, so will have to wait and see if it makes another dive later. But gj spotting a potential Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I thought you were not trading GBPJPY with this strategy, am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
i am sorry, I meant gj as in good job, but know I do not trade gbp/jpy, it is a good pair to trade, but not this method.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Looking at a AUD/USD and NZD/USD, of course this is demo, but looks like they are setting up a nice short possibility.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Agree, short at 0.9131 at the close of previous bar was a valid one.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
These are the demo, not live, but here would be the entries for these two.... AUD/USD : Short at .9131 counting a two pip spread, I will see if it hits ASK price of .9104 NZD/USD : Short at .7137 counting a three pip spread, I will see if it hits ASK price of ..7109 The valid entry of the NZD/USD is next candle taken for the AUD/USD.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Looks possible now, but still early into candle so will have to see where this goes.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I get what you mean...currently RSI LCD indicator only alert when it crosses then close on it... So I update the indicator again to alert when it crosses 55/45 line without wait it to close yet (repaint)...in this upadate, I provided option either we want repaint alert or not and also to choose either playsound or alert message. Please inform me again if still have error...thx

--- 帖子 #616 ---
this is my entry for GU now....almost hit TP...

--- 帖子 #617 ---
You mean BID price of 9104, I suppose. Because you are taking short at .9131 which mean you'll not have any spread cost when entering the trade. But you'll have spread cost while exiting which means your Bid price will be .9104 and Ask price will be .9106 and when you exit at .9106 Ask price, your profit will be +25 pips. Ask price of .9104 will earn you +27 pips. Same logic is true for NZDUSD trade.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
yes you are correct, I am $hitty with math or logic for that matter

--- 帖子 #619 ---
For cable current bar is too large, IMO, and the previous bar didn't meet RSI requirement and 3 was still above 20. Re. Euro. Only problem is the lack of momentum. If you check MACD and ADX, they are too flat. So I am not sure if this is a valid signal due to MACD filter. What do you think, Raz?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
well I hope it falls more for you, I did not short because I did not get a close of the candle. A couple things I think will make me not use the LCD for RSI, and this is my observation not a disrespect to your work on making adjustments that work for you. For one I like looking at the RSI graph, it will show double tops, double bottoms, divergences, and so forth as well as pattern formations. Also I like to look at big jumps on RSI, and sometimes avoid them or enter a few pips back. however I like what you have done, and I am not a computer wiz at all, and I am horrible with the MT4, so I appreciate what you have done.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I did not take the cable, again same analysis the 3 ema was still above the 20, and the RSI jumped too much. But I did take the EURO and SWISSY so both live trades, I hope wit the sessions opening up soon, this will kick some volume up to push em through. Short EURO 1.4831 Long Swissy 1.0189

--- 帖子 #622 ---
again, my mistake, not paying attention, the adx did not confirm. EEEEK I was doing so many things at one time and I took the long, should not have. However I am in, and now I can only hope it falls through. So the USD/CHF is a chance trade now, should have left it alone.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I did take neither of them due to lack of momentum on MACD histogram wandering around zero line. On top of this, ADX was at 11 for USDCHF though it was better for Euro. Hope you get some pips. Yesterday, I took a trade (long) on USDJPY at the close of 14.30 bar without noticing the flatness of MACD (though ADX was at a better position) and then realised it and exited at BE.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
all I can do now is cross my fingers for now, and see where this lands. I expect a push once the session opens, but who knows it may push my SL.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
That is my song right now, well the AUD/USD hit +25 pips, so that is good news, although it was demo, but it I am keeping record.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
AUDUSD was a better setup compared to other two and see how it easily hit the target. Hope you hit, too.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
getting there, I do not like to waste good pushes so I have +2 pip SL on both open pairs, incase it decides to reverse back and take me out. However I think I am giving it enough room to make it its push. I think they are going to stair step its way to the TP, lets us hope. At least now I know I am not losing any pips on these trades Yes the AUD/USD was a good hit, the NZD moves much slower

--- 帖子 #628 ---
NZD/USD took sometime but it hit +25 pips as well, and so did my live trades So the actual real entry is the swissy long on close of 1.0998, and going to watch this now. However did get two trades lucky live, and here are my stats CURRENT STATS: WEEKLY TRAIL: 3 WINNERS (1 MISSED)(one got in with luck was not valid, Blackeagle) 0 LOSSES (0 MISSED) EARNED THIS WEEK $28.59 MONTHLY TRAIL: STARTING BALANCE $499.83 MONTHLY GOAL $644.20 CURRENT BALANCE $490.37

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Well looking at this valid entry, I would say I could not be able to re-enter back into this one, considering I was already in it before it happened. However it closes at 1.0999 and reaches a high of 1.0221, so therefore it made a profit run, and I would have moved stops accordingly. Therefore it is a valid winner, and will take the place of the counted stats, so it valid stats. Pick shows the entry candle, and shows that it hit +20 pips at least.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
You definetly have to be happy now, you TP certainly was cleared for sure.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
was going to long it again, but it closed a bear candle, and did not confirm

--- 帖子 #632 ---
thx Raj... bank 25pips just now.. at the moment, I only wait for GU, EU &amp; UJ pair for next entry (trending)...hope can catch one more trade before call it a day...

--- 帖子 #633 ---
5 is between 10 and 20 for UJ, so don't wait for it with this volatility at least a couple of H4 bars. EU and USDCHF is potential, IMO.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Are only possibilities, and depending how loonie pans out, it could be a possible short However shorting the loonie would counter product the euro short and swissy long, so it would have to be ultra-valid to make sense

--- 帖子 #635 ---
This question was brought up in my windows live messenger chat a few minutes ago, and this is something that is probably the hardest to explain, considering it is a judgement call. First of all not every pair will behave the same, nor will they follow this rule. However through tons of testing and trading I have concluded to throw up a warning sign when ever there is a big jump on RSI, which in other words means everything is valid, but sometimes the RSI makes a huge jump which could either continue to go towards TP, or retrace back, or reverse back down. Usually a news signal that would cause this. I usually try to stay away from big jumps on RSI, but sometimes if everything is lining up in that direction I may even get in a few pips back and catch it for a a ride. However a trader asked me what I meant about the loonie(USD/CAD) in post #600, WOW! already 600, good lord, feel bad for anyone has to read this entire thread, props to Stewart for taking the time. Anyways i posted that there was a valid sig, but the RSI was too big of a jump so I passed it up. Had you still got in you would have been fine, and it definetly hit TP. So the pic below shows a few things, first you can see the green box is the correct close of the RSI at 55, which is valid long entry. Now the red circle indicates where the RSI line closes on this particular entry candles, rememer we get in on the close of candles, at least I do and that is what this method suggest. Next you see white lines, these are zones in the RSI that the RSI line covered on that single candle that close to give us a valid entry. If it is that many zones, then I usually feel a possible retrace or I think the mini trend within that candle is possibly exhausted. Therefore making it a risky trade. However I am no expert, but this is my explanation of 'Big Jumps on RSI' by the way I posted the 4HR chart to show you that we were in LONG mode at that time

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Euro short again, and another swissy long, one of our members in windows live messenger chat did point out adx is low in swissy, but it will determine how it closes and that may make it differnce. So we have to wait and see where this goes

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Live trades: Short EUR/USD 1.4805 Long USD/CHF 1.0207 Had a delay on my MB Navigator, so I got in a little late, but taking valid sigs. Also Demo Short NZD/USD 71.27, looking for 70.99

--- 帖子 #638 ---
hope the market with me..

--- 帖子 #639 ---
If you were not in the chat room with us, you missed some serious fun and action, bunch of made pips, in matter of fact I think at least 5 of us won on multiple trades. However I am still holding live trade on swissy, the euro hit +25 pips easisly, and the NZD/USD is +20 pips at least, so another winner

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Closed Swissy on +2 pip SL, once I see price move +18 pips, I move SL to +2 pips. In other words a break even trade. These trades got sort of lucky, made a slight mistake and trade 10,000 lot size, but it paid out good so I cannot complain. CURRENT STATS: WEEKLY TRAIL: 4 WINNERS (1 MISSED)(one got in with luck was not valid, http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/winking.gif Blackeagle) 0 LOSSES (0 MISSED) 1 BREAK EVENS EARNED THIS WEEK $57.05 MONTHLY TRAIL: STARTING BALANCE $499.83 MONTHLY GOAL $644.20 CURRENT BALANCE $517.35 Of course he NZD/USD hit +20 pips, so that is fairing well as of late.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Had to rush to work, got up late. However I peeked at my charts right before I left and saw that the USD/JPY was a possible short, was wondering if anyone can post a chart and see if that was a valild entry, since I do not have access to MT4 here at my work.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
May be the one with arrow but RSI is at 32, so not sure if it is valid due to RSI level. Other conditions met and if it had been a valid one, it would have hit +25.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
well it looks like you are right, I only had like 5 secs to glance at that charts, running late to work. But thanks for the chart.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Learned so much in the chat today. Thanks RAZ for arranging a chat for us to work together. Steve

--- 帖子 #645 ---
So do you have an RSI limit such as no short trade below 35 or long trade above 65 telling you not to take the trade? If so, what are your RSI limits?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I do not take trades in the 35 or 65 range. I probably saw a valid entry about 7 candles after your red arrow on your chart, where it broke from the 45 line south. I was thinking that may have been a valid entry short, but then again i looked only just a few seconds, so I will have to take a closer look when I get home. But I do not take trades in the 65 or 35 range.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Well it was fun too, considering all of us had open trades and we all banked pips, so yes windows live chat is more instantaneous. So once again anyone is free to join the group chat, and again it is an open inventation to talk about any method. I would say more traders in the chat room trade various methods then the raz method itself. From all over this globe too. Lot of brilliant minds, windows live messenger(you may have to download this messenger, because I think MSN messenger does not work) my contact is : tamarraq@hotmail.com

--- 帖子 #648 ---
That wasn't a valid entry, I believe, because MACD histogram was pointing up.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Very much appreciated^^

--- 帖子 #650 ---
after looking back yes the histogram filtered that signal out, so did not miss anything being away at work. looking to get in on some trades of course like the last few days the euro and cable falling at open of sessions, showing strong dollar again. I will trade anything valid, however practically everything on the MACD Sig lines are voiding everything out, the USD/JPY is forming up, possible short later in action

--- 帖子 #651 ---
8.00 bar on chart was a valid signal, IMO, though MACD signal was flat, but when you look at previous position of MACD signal line, it could be taken. Already at +20. And hit +25 now.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
yes the yen is falling, which is fine, I wanted a clean break off the 45 line, but now it looks like it is gone, but I have had good luck catching shorts later in the sessions, so looking for that. Euro and Swissy maybe going to form a good position depending how they work out, so will have to wait and see.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
when we had the signal, RSI moved from 43.2786 to 35.2358 which was just above your 35 limit. On previous bars, MACD signal line was pointing up.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
euro short swissy long loonie long(needs more confirmation) theres are not live, but will need to see how they close next candle

Actually had not been away from cpu, I should have closed euro and cable and winners, they did cross +20 pips each, and the swissy never really had a chance. However losses are losses, so it was my own mistake CURRENT STATS: WEEKLY TRAIL: 4 WINNERS (1 MISSED)(one got in with luck was not valid, http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/winking.gif Blackeagle) 3 LOSSES (0 MISSED) 1 BREAK EVENS EARNED THIS WEEK $16.13 MONTHLY TRAIL: STARTING BALANCE $499.83 MONTHLY GOAL $644.20 CURRENT BALANCE $475.03

--- 帖子 #658 ---
I notice that cable and swissy, and even usd/jpy all showed possible shorts, but I took the only valid sig I ahd short euro. Live Trade: Short EUR/USD 1.4712 Need to get back on winning track, going to watch this closely and not lose out on a good profit push, the three losers this morning, two of them hit +20 pips, and I was not there to move SL, but this time being a little mre dilegent

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Raz, yesterday you said if RSI is below 35, you won't take short and if above 65, no long. For the current Euro short signal, the RSI was at 33, what do you think? And for the very same reason, I believe Swissy was not a valid signal either (RSI was at 67).

--- 帖子 #660 ---
if it clean breaks the 45 line, and lands past 40, thats ok, but if one candle covered 4 to 5 zones, then more than likely I hold off, or get in a few pips back. Looking at USD/JPY it is showing a good short signal if it closed right.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Live Trade: Short USD/JPY 87.82 Taking valid entries, this too closed below 40, but I feel confident I am getting in with good momentum

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Cheers to getting back on the winning track - we certainly don't want to be at minus $1 million in 7 years time! This is a hard system to test as it requires lots of screen time - funny nobody has coded an EA yet to prove its efficacy.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Well this is how real trading is, and sometimes it is real tough, but I vow not to change any part of this, and keep pushing forward. I did lose out on my Euro and Yen trade, but hey I can only keep taking sigs. Account balance dropped alot, but not changing a thing and will keep taking em as I go.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Raz how is it going ? are you still trading this method ? have u made some winner ? yours IT

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I will definetly keep this method going, I will post all live trades. It will be on a demo account for now. However after a couple of months of getting back into it, I will go live. I am currently live on my other method. But I feel strongly about this method still. I am still working fulltime, so for now I am going to catch all valid entries week after to week to show wins vs loss, and then get back into it. Man it has been a bit, but all my forex live money tied up into my other method.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Here is a trade that happened about 7 hours ago, valid sig, and there for enter at .7625 and definte hit TP at .7600

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi dear raz please show h4 chart and 30min chart for your position Regards

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I will going forward, as for that last trade, if you read the original rules which is at the beginning you should understand how the method works. Most of the post from then on till now is pretty much live trades and gibber gabber. However for that last NZD/USD trade you can see the circles is where I confirm the indicators with my trade, as for the 4hr chart it just sets me in what mode I am in, as for this time I was in Short mode.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Thanks raz i check aud/usd with this method and entry valid signal 7 or 8 hours ago

--- 帖子 #571 ---
So just to give you and idea, not often this happens, but NZD/USD again gave a nice valid short sig. short at .7561 and tp is .7536

--- 帖子 #572 ---
good for one valid entry, and winner.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
short at 1.3501, and this one probably was just a +20 pips, but it did hit TP,

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Now looking back I almost took this aud/usd short, but I was stayin true to the method, and notice that the MACD histogram was showing reverse momentum, therefore I voided this entry, and yes it did hit TP, but I would'nt have taken it.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Welcome back bro. Hope all well man...!!! Cheers to your start once again Regards P.S. Remember me? hehehehe......

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Of course I remember,it has been a bit, but I am happy to see you as well brother.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hi Raz, thank your for sharing. I can't agree with you more the above. Many times I just Just Jump In, and resulted in losses and blowed my accounts due to over bet on lot size. I have few questions: (1) Your risk reward ration is 1:1. Am I right? (2) Since using this method of scalping fo 25 pips per trade, you will need to do a lot of trades per day to accumulate the profits. Can your method then works on smaller time frame..say 30 min chart for trend analysis and 5 mins for trade execution (i.e on 5 mins chart look for 3 periods EMAs crosses the 20 periods EMAs with RSI rebounded from overbought / oversold region)? Have you tested this out? (3) If your entries are not filled within your trading hour of the day, do you cancel the entries? (4) Do you wait for 2 or 3 candles to close above the EMAs crosses for long (and conversely below the EMAs for short position)? (5) Do you counter check with smaller time frame than 30min before you enter your entries? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I'm still looking for a good entry system. I nailed down the structure and the flow of orders. now timing it is rather the difficult part. anyone knows of a good 5 min or 1min entry system. I'm willing to share my other info with all. Thanks
