I used Fib and pivot, high, low to create zones and levels for my trades. Because they are used by retail traders, they work, they are a tool for Market Markers to find liquidity.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Zones on GU, AU, NU, UC, UJ.

Note: on AU, price bounced up from M R38, Q R50. So I would look for entry to go long in this zone on lower timeframes.

On NU, price bounced down from M R38 and Y R61. Looking for short in this zone.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Some cross pairs on Daily chart.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Fibo is a great tool. Lots of traders use it. I am amazed at the confluence of levels.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
GBPCAD M5, price bounced exactly from the zone.

Just scalp.

EURUSD M1

Harvest some pips during the London opening session. I finished my day, still monitoring the price action on the level.

hi, nts0904, i found 'fibo levels.ex4' can not work in my mt4, it displays only a line... what's wrong with it? or can you upload the .mq4 ?

thank you very much.

i encount this problem.

I only have ex4 file.

Hello thank you very much for sharing, can you tell me what is your winning rate with this system/how much have you made in pips and how long you been using it. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
You are asking me a difficult question. I am using Fibo levels to identify zones where the price might bounce from them. I usually look for entries in low timeframes. The winning rate depends on your experience. With me, it's about 80% wining rate because I don't take big profits, I am willing to take profit when the price moves against my trade.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi all,

I took a vacation and now I'm back to thread to continue sharing this system.  I contacted my friend who wrote the line indicator for this system.  He says lines are pivots.  Well, they are the same as Davit pivot indicators, but they are calculated by week, month, quarter and year.  So if anyone can possibly rewrite this indicator.  We will discuss deals with specific zones.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Can you ask him for a trading instruction PDF on how  he trades this system??
How have you been trading this all along?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
He just gives me the indicator and shows me the confluence zones of the levels.  I rely on my experience to trade.  I trade a pullback after breaking out of a zone.  But if I see move quickly to a zone, I can trade against the trend with a small stop loss and exit on profit above 1R.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
During my vacation I looked at pivots, and I saw their advantage in bias and trends.  Maybe that's my second strategy.  It won't take much effort and is more recognizable.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
guys, I need to download a drawing, can someone help me

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I know many traders have lost money to try systems. And now I offer all free. I will answer any questions tomorrow, after I give you a more visual view of the market.

Without the holy grail, anything can happen in the mảket. What you need is the trend advantage. If you are a professional trader you can look for highs and lows. But I am not a professional trader and I choose to follow the trend, it is less stressful to trade against the trend.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Templates and indicators I share don't work for other accounts.  I will give you a new strategy to follow the trend and have a more intuitive view of the market.

This is a professional trader on FF, I am following him.  It looks like his deals are quite difficult to execute for me, although I have learned a lot about price action, patterns and levels.  My years of experience and trading hours may not be enough to trade as well as he does, but I know I can make money in the market based on the advantages the market offers.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
More like a profitable win rate,consistent strategy would be much appreciated...

Good morning, it's 9:00 AM in my country.

Here's my chart of setting up the Daily, Weekly, and Monthly pivot points.

I will not cover everything without questioning the chart. Please let your brain work when you see them. We will see a trend advantage when pivot points and prices are on the chart.

I learned to draw zones on my phone since I take it every where and no longer use indicators. I very rarely use my computer. It took awhile to get use to using my MetaTrader 4 phone App for trading but it works great, now that I am use to it.

You can get rid of the indicators learn price action and practice practice practice!

What Breaking the 4-Minute Mile Taught Us About the Limits of Conventional Thinking Bill Taylor

March 09, 2018SaveThe sad news of the passing of Roger Bannister, the first human being to run a four-minute mile, got me thinking about his legacy — not just as one of the great athletes of the past century, but as an innovator, a change agent, and an icon of success. As it turns out, when he broke through a previously impenetrable track-and-field barrier, he taught all of us what it takes to break new ground.

Most people know the basic story of Roger Bannister, who, on May 6, 1954, busted through the four-minute barrier with a time of three minutes, fifty-nine and four-tenths of a second. But it was not until I decided to write about him for my book Practically Radical, and read a remarkable account of his exploits by the British journalist and runner John Bryant, that I understood the story behind the story — and the lessons it holds for leaders who want to bust through barriers in their fields. Bryant reminds us that runners had been chasing the goal seriously since at least 1886, and that the challenge involved the most brilliant coaches and gifted athletes in North America, Europe, and Australia. “For years milers had been striving against the clock, but the elusive four minutes had always beaten them,” he notes. “It had become as much a psychological barrier as a physical one. And like an unconquerable mountain, the closer it was approached, the more daunting it seemed.”

This was truly the Holy Grail of athletic achievement. It’s fascinating to read about the pressure, the crowds, the media swirl as runners tried in vain to break the mark. Bryant also reminds us that Bannister was an outlier and iconoclast — a full-time student who had little use for coaches and devised his own system for preparing to race. The British press “constantly ran stories criticizing his ‘lone wolf’ approach,” Bryant notes, and urged him to adopt a more conventional regimen of training and coaching.

So the four-minute barrier stood for decades — and when it fell, the circumstances defied the confident predictions of the best minds in the sport. The experts believed they knew the precise conditions under which the mark would fall. It would have to be in perfect weather — 68 degrees and no wind. On a particular kind of track — hard, dry clay — and in front of a huge, boisterous crowd urging the runner on to his best-ever performance. But Bannister did it on a cold day, on a wet track, at a small meet in Oxford, England, before a crowd of just a few thousand people.

When Bannister broke the mark, even his most ardent rivals breathed a sigh of relief. At last, somebody did it! And once they saw it could be done, they did it too. Just 46 days Bannister’s feat, John Landy, an Australian runner, not only broke the barrier again, with a time of 3 minutes 58 seconds. Then, just a year later, three runners broke the four-minute barrier in a single race. Over the last half century, more than a thousand runners have conquered a barrier that had once been considered hopelessly out of reach.

Well, what goes for runners goes for leaders running organizations. In business, progress does not move in straight lines. Whether it’s an executive, an entrepreneur, or a technologist, some innovator changes the game, and that which was thought to be unreachable becomes a benchmark, something for others to shoot for. That’s Roger Bannister’s true legacy and lesson for all of us who see the role of leadership as doing things that haven’t been done before.

In fact, two Wharton School professors have analyzed the lessons for business of the four-minute mile. In their book, The Power of Impossible Thinking, Yoram Wind and Colin Crook they devote an entire chapter to an assessment of Bannister’s feat, and emphasize the mindset behind it rather than the physical achievement. How is it, they wonder, that so many runners smashed the four-minute barrier after Bannister became the first to do it? “Was there a sudden growth spurt in human evolution? Was there a genetic engineering experiment that created a new race of super runners? No. What changed was the mental model. The runners of the past had been held back by a mindset that said they could not surpass the four-minute mile. When that limit was broken, the others saw that they could do something they had previously thought impossible.”

Most thinking about strategy, competition, and leadership emphasizes the intricacies of business models: revenues, costs, niches, leverage. But mental models are what allow organizations and their leaders to try not just to be the best at what everyone else can do, but to do things that only they can do — which, over time, shows others what it possible. They don’t accept the limitations, tradeoffs, and middle-of-the-road sensibilities that define conventional wisdom. In other words, great leaders don’t just out-perform their rivals. They transform the sense of what’s possible in their fields.

That’s what makes icons like Roger Bannister so unforgettable — and so important.

You are basically like a computer what ever method of trading has been programed into your mind is what you are going to see in the markets. Whether it is Supply and Demand , candlestick patterns , order flow, order block trading, institutional candles , Market Profile, Pivot Points, support and resistance, relying on indicators ect. The capability of the method you lean can only produce the results it is able too. A persons method can cause them to see trees and not the forest.

@Forexholy, I've been following this thread for the past few days and I can see you're doing amazing stuff with this strategy.

I'm just starting my trading career and I hope to learn a lot from you if you don't mind.

For now, I'm going through the video's you shared in the past, hopefully I won't have too much questions by the time I'm done.

Keep up the good work and may you be blessed with plenty more pips for your generosity.

PS.

I noticed your charts are mostly on M1 and M5 timeframes, is this where you map out the zones?

You also seem to have a preference for US30 and NAS100, is there any particular reason for this?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I normally map out zones on M15 time frame and take trades on M1 and M5 The US30 , NAS100 pay better than currency pairs and the move does not have to be very big. Gold also pays good!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I also map out on 1HR

--- 帖子 #86 ---
To answer you one more time because I trade strictly on my phone I find the 5Min the best time frame to do zones on my phone and enter using the 1 Min timeframe using Price Action because the move does not have to be very big to make good profits.

I see.. Thanks for this.

I gave it a try. What do you think?

Also I noticed in your last chart, the zone you traded had been tested a couple of times.. so

1. When do you decide not to trade a zone again and wait for price at the next one as multiple tests could mean an imminent breakthrough.

2. Do you always wait for a reversal signal before executing your trade.

3. And do you trade along any particular direction or it just doesn't matter as long as it's in your mapped zone.. Like the saying, "The trend is your friend"

Thanks in anticipation and for your time.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
1. I wait for confirmation of price Action it supersedes everything.

2. I do my best again Price Action

3.No particular direction. Yes go by your zones

Good trading my friend!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank you.

Ok, I'll run more tests and see how it goes.

Cheers.

Nice job but it's not clear to me what are you trading?

They are not supply&demand zones and neither support and resistance.

I watched few of your videos but still not clear.

When you have time can you please clarify?

Are there rules in marking these zones?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
My zones are drawn from areas of multiple candle rejection

especially wicks.

Let me say this about Order Blocks cause I put out a lot of vids for guys to watch. I personally only look for a 2 candle engulfing pattern formation when it comes to order blocks I try to keep it as simple as possible. I don’t look for 6 different formations.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now if you look at this trade The blue line is the previous day low and the red line is previous day high I normally always mark these. Now looking at the picture the bottom candles to the left the blue candle engulfs the black down candle. Then price goes up and then pulls back and then starts up again. This same pattern also works from the top going down.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
This pattern can work on any timeframe depending on how long you want to be in the trade. It can also reverse with the same engulfing pattern

--- 帖子 #235 ---
So in essence you can look for this pattern on all timeframes but it is best to find it on a higher timeframe 30 Min and above then drop down to a lower timeframe for an entry using the same pattern.

Looks to me as if there is an engulfing order block pattern

Sir Forexholy

How many pips you keep the trade running if it is going away from your perceived direction, and do you just book the loss or do an opposite trade with higher lot size what is your way to manage a loss trade?

Hello Forexholy and others,

thanks for sharing, very interesting

from a newbie's point of view,

it seems like your trades have a very, very high chance of hitting the target

with large lots and very probable and reasonable take profits

could you comment briefly, if it is not too much trouble,

how do you proceed in case the price goes against the trade?

Manual closing, stoploss, edge ...?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Sometimes manual sometimes stoploss.

The Donforex indicator is designed to find and draw zones and trendlines and it does a good job. It is not designed to trade, so it’s not the fault of the indicator.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Well the zones were drawn from equal lows and equal highs.An order block was formed in the equal lows. Price came out of that then retraced back into the order block and started up to the equal highs

After getting an idea of bullish or bearish from D1, how you define an OB either it is the most extreme candle of LTF swing or it is the candle which were broken in BOS?

I'm asking this because in sometime in strong reversal of continuation, the extreme last candle is not retested instead market retest the candle which were broken by BOS.

I am now looking at more than just Order Blocks, it is a mixture of ICT’s trading concepts. On the 1 Day timeframe I am not looking for Orderblocks it is ICT’s training on Mastering High Probability scalping videos.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I have watched that videos but also have a question or i didn't get how to know if the market will respect the 61.8 fibo for retracement or it will retrace back to 100% or more. Please answer if you get that point.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I don’t use fibs anymore now that I learned how to read price action without indicators. Indicators are a lagging graphical representation of what price is doing. I do know fibs are a pretty much leading indicator but I just don’t use them to much anymore.

Hi Forexholy,

Can you explain and go into a bit more detail about how you use ICT concepts please.

I have been looking at it for some time and there are some OB that works and other that dont that is the reason that Im asking because is still unclear to me which order blocks will work and witch one will not.

Thanks

for your help

Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Well the first thing I would ask you is what timeframe are you trading because order blocks appear in every timeframe. What time of day do you normally trade because banks are going move money and move price when they are in operation. Also what session are you trading New York, London, Asian?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I trade london the first 2 hours and I use the 1-5-15 timeframe

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Use at the least a 4Hr time frame then go to a lower time frame and find an order block that is in the same direction of your higher timeframe order block.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
There will be swings or pullbacks in the lower time frame and it is possible to trade an order block in the opposite direction of the higher time frame. You want to be in flow with the higher timeframes. Always start out in the higher timeframes.

Hi Forexholy, I've been starting trading recently using 15 min looking for support and resistance area and trading that on 5 min chart, Do you have any suggestion on where i can learn more about your trading style. Do you have any suggested youtube channels to learn about trading on lower time frames. I want to see myself as pure price action trader, how i still lack market structure and candlesticks. any thought would help. thanks . the picture in the attachment is an example of how i trade

--- 帖子 #389 ---
The best person I know of to learn from is the originator of Order blocks and that is ICT trader on YouTube he has a tone of free learning material.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
This is a very good video of his which it won’t let me post here.  (ICT Forex Price Action Lecture: Daytrading & Psychology)

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Thanks Forex,

I found that other guy which you just posted video of, is doing pretty good job explaining as well (techicalgod). Great material, if you have more of that kind please drop here or to me in PM. Greatly appreciate it! (just view the ICT channel, he has mostly about patterns and other stuff. Does he call order block as order flow?)

--- 帖子 #392 ---
well, thank you for the info. anyway, lets just keep moving because we are still here working.

by the way do you have any idea with traiiling stop loss?

also, any idea how to catch take profit with the highest candle (iHighest) to execute take profit for the buy? and lowest candle (iLowest) to take profit for the sell? // with trailing stop loss correlation.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I don’t use a trailing stop loss.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
He is the originator of Order blocks he calls them Order blocks

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thanks, have to watch all his videos now. Do you have more info on his community. Looks like comments are turned off everywhere and no info on anything there.

Do you know his best video where he explains order blocks?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
ok.  please if you have without trailing stop loss to share, I'll very much appreciate it. thanks.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
To tell the truth I am still looking through his videos for that.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
If you really want to start from the beginning of ICT career, I suggest you to have a look to this video :

I did not like the video, he makes it so simple with the benefit of highsight or whichever way you want a call it.

watch minute 7:35 to minute 8. It breaks structure to the upside but then you get a bigger correction that breaks a low but because the market keeps going up is part of market structure.

Let me see  when you are trading real time what you consider break of structure or not

kind regards

Hi,

How is it going,

How many timeframes you look at to take a trade, Im asking this because I see in some of your posts that you have from the daily to the 1 min chart.

Also dont you get confused when you look at so many timeframes, 1 min structure will be up, 5 min up, then 15 min down and so on. What a mean is that every timeframe is going to tell different story

Thanks

Kind regards

I have to say the true that the EA you told, I wrote some years ago, used some specify method to exploit broker's bug. At this time, this EA unprofitable.

just stopped paying for monthly memberships - I got to month 7 and I decided I could not bring myself to pay him any more money. He promised so much for the mentorship ("I'm going to pour myself out for you this year") but delivered so little. Each month is supposed to be focused on a particular element to his teachings, and he promised to spend each video elaborating on the topics. But they were so basic and short (the only long ones were where he rants about how he created all this and how people are ripping him off) and devoid of the detail about each topic that he had promised. His excuse was "I'm giving you what you paid for" which is totally the opposite of what he was saying in the free youtube vids when enticing us all to join the ("the last ever year of mentorship, I'm never doing this again") mentorship.

Plus there is a lot of Captain Hindsight going on in his analysis - one example, a few weeks ago he stated something he said would not occur in EURUSD according to institutional orderflow, and it DID happen. I had annotated the very thing in my chart, and was interested to see what he would say about it in the next video. Guess what? He'd changed his chart, and made no mention of it... that was the last straw for me.

He spends so much time & energy brainwashing his Disciples to just look at DXY, EU, GU & EG. And limits them to the LDN & NY Killzone timezones. AND makes his students alter their day to start at NY EST midnight, which is 7 hours into the trading day. I was always curious about this, but then realised its all part of his control-freak nature to keep his students limited and hanging on his every word.

I could go on and on, but this is already a long reply. He is an insecure, delusional, bipolar man but who is also very clever and articulate. I do not question his genuine belief about himself, as he is his own No.1 fan, but, I have to say, outside of his basic teachings (which he did NOT invent, only appropriated from others), he has very little to offer the world of forex trading.

So for those of you out there who maybe lamented missing out on his 'last ever' mentorship in 2021, may I reassure you you didn't really miss out - it's all there in his free youtube vids.

Would you recommend just working from the daily highs and lows to begin with? Looking for reversals and order blocks?

1.) Check forexfactory calendar news

2.) mark off yesterday high and low of daily candle

3.) drop to 4HR and 1 Hr timeframe draw zones

4.) Identify direction of pair you want to trade

5.) look for rejection candle wicks and or order blocks coming

Out of a zone.

6.) Use price action on 5 Min timeframe for entry

7.) place stop loss according to percentage you are willing to

Risk.

If you are just starting learn price action first.

Go to 2nd page on the board look at that first video I posted. If you use indicators stop using them and learn price action first.

Each currency pair has a range it trades daily. News can effect the normal range it trades. Mark previous day high and low, price will trade next day either back into the range or if near previous day high could break above it or if near previous day low could break below.

The inner bank does things at certain times of the day, highs and lows are established. Reversal moves are done. Price does not just move to move.

Hi Forex,

Looks like your TP is always 5-10 pips. Looks like it's a part of your strategy. You wait for good solid move and than just get in the middle of the move for those 5-10 pips?

Forexholy, I see that you have the concepts of ICT order block (or supply demand however you want to call it) very clear. Please could you go into more detail in how you do it, how you make it work for you.

You post many charts from daily to 1 min chart of a pair and I think that for many people that order blocks and so on is clear to them will understand them but for many other people will not.

You post many videos and they are great I have watched 90% of them, but each of them has there on way to look at the markets. That is why Im asking you to explain how you do it.

For example, most everyone that knows a bit about order blocks, knows that is the last down candle before and up move or the last up candle before a down move and the higher time frame has to be in line. But when you look at a live chart most people has difficulty on finding the order block that is really going to hold.

If you dont want to disclose how you do it I understand, in any case thanks for your input with the charts and the videos

thanks

Kind regards

Order blocks have orders residing in them. Price pulls away from them then back into them collecting orders then out of them. This is why they are called Order Blocks

This video is pretty good on Order Blocks except he does use EMA's which if you learn pure Price Action you will not need.

Let me say this for the sake of Order Blocks because I here it in many videos all the time that Order Blocks are the last up candle or last down candle when one is formed. That is a false statement, I am not sure of the originator of this perception , but I am pretty sure it did not start with ICT trader. I’ve seen a video of his where he did not use the last down candle to find an order block.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
The Market will always be in 1 of 4 phases

Consolidation,Reversal, Retracement or Expansion

--- 帖子 #701 ---
In every video that I have watched it says the same.

Here is my understanding on order blocks from all the videos that I have watched about and another ff thread dedicated to it.

1- Higher time frame trend  for the purpose of the explanation let say 15 min chart- In every video apart from the one posted the other day that uses moving averages, they always use market structure - This to me is very subjective - All videos are in high sight and some massive correction are not change of trend and others are depending on what it does afterwards. That is one of the reasons I believe Forexholy uses fractals to identify market structure objectively, I could be wrong

2 You mark the last down candle before an upmove that breaks structure

3- Drop down to the entry chart for this example 1 min chart - when the price on the 1 min chart touches the order block you do not enter, you wait until the 1 min chart breaks structure and then the price revisits the 1 min chart ordeblock created when it broke out structure.

That is how I understand and how all videos explained

The problem that I see and that is why I asked Forexholy to explain how he does it, are ?

1-How you go about market structure

2- the factor between timeframes

3- and the most important how to know which order block has more probability to work.

I do not use this strategy I use VSA. But trying I have studied a lot and what noneone tells you on the videos is how to find the order blocks that have higher probability

Thanks

Kind regards

yes nobody talks about this

For me I start with marking the previous daily high and low. Price will trade back into this range or above it, if near its high or below it if near its low. Each currency pair has its daily range it trades. I then look for order blocks on the Daily and 4Hr as I anticipate being in and out of trades the same day. I drop down to a lower timeframe. I look for order blocks inconjunction with the higher timeframe Order block. If I find one I will mark it off like drawing zones. I then drop down to a 1 min. time frame looking for more order blocks in the same direction of the higher timeframe. If I find one in alliance with all this criterier. I wait for the expansion out of the order block then the pullback into it. Then the BOS (Break of Structure) Then enter. I like using the 15 Min time frame to draw out zones on my phone. Turning my phone side ways to see the whole trading day.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I have also just started to use volume bars to help with timing my entries.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Do you know any videos or pdfs better explaining marking the previous daily high and low i really don't understand this concept

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I hope I am doing it right.

Hey, Thanks a lot for this. A lot is making sense after looking at the diagrams you shared and the videos.

To Forexholy:

I am very impressed with your technical knowledge however I noticed you show only results from your demo account. May I ask do you actually trade real accounts? Because if the results you posted were even half as good in a real account, you would be the richest person in the world, you would actually have more money than Bezos. I don't think you are a scammer but something doesnt quite add up, maybe you are not posting your losses or something, but having 99% winrate and making $200k a day is just something very fishy about it. I want to learn from you but I would love to know more about you, a you at least a millionaire in real life?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Yes this is demo trading I have nothing to hide. I have had big losses. I can post the demo trading I have done for the week. As I have said this is the first year I have learned about Order Blocks never heard of it before. I have nothing to sell if thats what your getting at to old to even think about that. Just trying to help others as I help myself. I will post my trades for this past week with the losses. I have no where near that amount of money. I chose to study Order Blocks because of the RR.

There you go.This was starting with a 50,000 demo account nothing to hide and nothing to sell don’t have time for that just trying to get better at trading. You never stop learning.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
I did start trading back in 2007 Stocks. Then discovered Forex and tried it off and on and traded many systems starting with indicators as most traders do and then learned price action and got rid of the indicators. One of the best things you can do. I do have many hours of screen time and maybe too many.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Now may I ask how long have you been trading and what do you know about the market of Forex? Do you trade demo or real or both?

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thanks a lot for showing your weekly trades, it would be very interesting for you to trade a real account using 0.01 lots, just to see what is possible, you wont be risking much. Maybe you could even trade a cent account with a $10 balance.

As for me, I have been trading the demo for over a year. I am a software engineer by trade and really love to get into the nuts and bolts of things, making my own indicators, EA's and strategies. I have seen so many people trying to sell their systems and scam others, forex is just a sad world.

The best traders I seen personaly were a bunch of saudi dudes who were making $4-15k a day, their trades always had crazy SL's like 150-300 pips and they would always go for 20,40,60,80,100 pips, I think they had an endless trail actually. They were doing about 15 trades a day on H4 and had a 90% winrate or something and their account size was probably $1mil.

I heard a lot about orderblocks but some people say that their not a sure thing, it seems to me like you have a lot of knowledge that can make them give this crazy winrate.

I found a really good free Position size calculator that works for Mt4 platform. I will post the link to the web page where you can download it.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
forexholy, greetings!

when we say free position, is that the limit order?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
This is impressive!

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I think you are misunderstanding. The software is free it is called a position size calculator.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I need to post this again because if you can get this and understand it. This will help you out very much with your trading.

The Market will always be in 1 of 4 phases

Consolidation,Reversal, Retracement or Expansion

If you see and know which phase the market is in you can see what the market is doing.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Do you trade a certain phase you did a lot of testing what phase is more profitable for you or you don't care about them because you are in and out if you're consistent and don't have funds why you don't try a prop  firm

--- 帖子 #721 ---
I like trade coming out of a reversal with the confirmation of an Orderblock.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
yes i understand thats a software. what im trying to ask is free position its like Limit order when we are goind to code it? just correct me if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I don’t know everything about the software. The main things I know are that It will calculate everything for you according to the risk you want to take with your account. It is probably the best risk management free software I have ever seen.

Hi

can you share that fib values? I see two OTE levels..

--- 帖子 #750 ---
I missed your reply. I am looking at different Prop Firms to trade with right now. Don’t know if you know about them but as long as you can pass there testing phase they have different account sizes and you get a split for trading for them. Depending on the firm it can range from 70% for you to 30 % for them there are many firms to chose from. The one Iam looking at goes up to 85%-15%. Account sizes can range from 5,000 up 200,000 and you can stack accounts. This is the one Iam looking at right now.

Forexholy I have a question.

Is it possible to learn your style of trading in a simple way? I mean you linked like 1000 videos and its just a bit overwhelming.

Is there any chance you could write a simple step by step list of steps you take?

I know you have 12 years of experience and each trade can have different problems, but like is it possible to explain it in a simple way?

Also what about BB's, EMA's and so on, do they play a role in checking bounds of the trades?

--- 帖子 #755 ---
If you really want to learn this system it does not come without a price, you will have to put in the time to learn. It’s not just write down the rules and you get it. If it was that easy we would not have a 95% rate of unsuccessful traders. 1.) Don’t use indicators learn price action first and you will never need indicators. The first video I posted on page 2 watch it study it. The videos on page 33 watch those and the Originator of this method ICT trader on YouTube go to his play list and start with the sniper series videos and work your way from there.

Totally agree. It takes time and practice to master the skill. I myself have been studying this method for over 8 to 12 months. And believe me it's not easy to get started without watching those ict videos.

I have been hunting order blocks myself as a beginner and I did find quite a few on 1H on XAUUSD, even in the last month.

I am still having trouble spotting an obvious order block vs some of the less obvious ones but I had some questions.

When did order blocks get discovered? did the banks trade that way since forex opened?

Is it possible to find an order block every single day or are they more random? for example using XAUUSD.

Since a lot of people know about orderblocks, do the banks try and pull any tricks to hide what they are doing or trick the people with fake orderblocks?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
They we’re first revealed by ICT Trader on YouTube years ago with many other things he teaches. From what I know he was an Institutional trader and has revealed stuff that no other trader has. Order blocks appear on all timeframes. I can normally find them everyday. I have never seen the banks try and pull tricks but all Orderblocks don’t work out!

1. Weakness above previous day’s high can be used to derive a bearish intraday bias.
2. Strength below previous day’s low can be used to derive a bullish intraday bias.

Is there something special about previous days (high-low) / 2 ? like halfway point. I see sometimes reversal happens to that point.

I wonder how the banks setup their order blocks, if its an algorithm or they just decide manually each day.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
This is really good and pretty much sums up this whole trading style.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
There are trading systems that just trade from the previous day high and low. I normally always mark these.It gives you a very good working range. If price is near the previous day high or low it can break it or trade back into the range. Order Blocks can help with this very much.

Trading with zones could also be called trading consolidation, its very easy to find trades at consolidations, when few candles starts ranging wait for the breakout and trade on the side of breakout.

Do you trade the order block before the london open? the one where there is a bit of manipulation and stop hunt happens? I was wondering if thats the most common place for the order blocks?

Also do you use fibonacci retracement? I noticed a lot of those reversals do happen on the fibo values.

Thanks

I like to normally make mine from the low of the order block candle to about the 50% mark up.This would be on a downward trend.If it is an upward trend and we have an Order Block I would normally drawn from the high of the candle to about the 50% mark down

I have now had to clean my mind of all the regular retail trading methodologies I have learned which are many. I now see the market completely different with Order Block trading and all the components that go with it. It’s like reprogramming a computer to preform a whole different set of rules and wipe everything else out. The perception and results are amazing.

@Forexholy

Are you still trading supply and demand?

From the videos you are posting lately it appears you are into ICT order blocks stuffs.

Did you do a course with ICT?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #934 ---
No I don't trade Supply and Demand any more. It is now ICT material I am studying.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
To me ICT Order Block concepts are about 50 levels above Supply and Demand.

You want a mostly full body candle. I would not use a candle with wicks like that showing indecision.

It is taught also to be the last down camdle before an up move begins.

Now having studied Order Block trading for a little while I find that traders here on forexfactory and youtube do not trade the original orderblock setup. There are a lot of modified concepts from the original instruction Michael of ICT Trading taught. Its like when you have a room full of people and you whisper a phrase in the first persons ear and they continue that to the next person and so on. By the time it gets to the last person the phrase is not the same.

so what is the original order block? is it better than what you find here at ff or youtube, is it worse and that is why people liked the concept but had change it

Keep it coming please. Interesting insights into a potentially very positive understanding of price movement. I'm trying to build this OB logic into my memory muscle. I found it difficult last week - price action was choppy and order blocks were broken for stop hunt purposes only. I'm about breakeven on a live account. Picking the right pair and direction is still a necessity I think.

First of all I want to thank you @Forexholy .

The Pictures and videos you are sharing are beyond helpful and a blessing for this forum.

May God bless you.

A few questions if you dont mind

What are your entry criteria and how do you know a wick is useable?

You talked about liquidity. How does Liquidity help your strategy?

You seem to be Trading the 15Minute TF. Is this the only timeframe you look at?

Where can a novice like me learn more about your strategy. I know you since the sefamor days

and your development was very cool...from trading with indicators to a indicatorless killer....

you can be proud of urself!

--- 帖子 #1103 ---

Hi Forexholy,

Which broker do you use?

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Wicks can be on any timeframe. Where there is an area of liquidity if price goes above equal highs at the top or below equal lows at the bottom that would be my first observation for a trade. I would then go down to the 1 min timeframe and wait for price action to line up with what Iam seeing and then get into the trade. I look at 4HR 1HR 15MIN 5MIN and 1 MIN wicks. I devloped my statagy from other stratagies and observation of the markets and lots of screen time. I cant say I know of anyone who trades exactly like me. I dont think any two people trade exactly alike. I have posted enough videos for you to develop your own profitable stratagy. Learn price Action first. The very first video I posted.

A few years ago, more and more currencies reacted to support and resistance, but now the price behavior has become much more difficult and it is difficult to distinguish whether a level is breaking or a broken level is fake.

Just to compliment you with your very experienced explanations and method.

As we know history has told us that most will miss both the mind set as well as method skills required to make a success of trading.

You have very successfully shown us your way that match's your personality and life skills.

Allowing what the page is telling you or what the market has determined to give targets and triggers on and off is a skill that is the key.

Relying on outside factors such as follow up indicators and ideas only adds to complication, delay and indecision, and ultimately failure.

Congratulations, we can all pick up a few points here and there no matter how experienced or successful if we keep an open mind, in this game you can always improve.

Cheers.

original consolidation

MM Buy Model:

Green 1: consolidation around a higher tf resistance level (hunting climax reversal type patterns: turtle soup, otes, candlestick patterns) 12 min (once market breaks below the range)

Red:  Breakdown/swing down from previous consolidation (5min-daily), retest of broken support of the consolidation (turtle soup, ote set up); it could break out and never retest broken support of the previous range. Ideally, you want a retest, but it doesn't have to.

Grey: smart money consolidation/reversal on higher tf support level (htf ob

Blue1: first profit from lower high to support range (possible sell ote); possible ote for buy; red to gray swing

Blue2: second profit from high to support range (possible sell ote for sell continuation); green 1 to gray swing

Green2: short term profit taking; take out stops from green 1 consolidation. Logical area of stops; majority profit taken because this area could be a reversal and retrace down deeper from grey to green 2 swing up; Be profitable!

MM Sell model:

Green 1: consolidation at a HTF support level to run up, price makes a move up

Blue: break above consolidation, can retrace down for ote, turtle soup low to push up to a HTF resistance level, retest if broken consolidation of range resistance turn support

Grey: price trades up to HTF resistance level then a break down; don't know if it'll be a high (4hr+ HTF)

Red1: break down from grey area; can retest broken support of grey; tp 1

Red2: tp 2

Green 2: majority of profit taken; taking out green 1 stops

There are 3 setups: Orderblocks, FVGs, Stop Runs Pick a timeframe to spot your setup: H1 or M30 or M15 Highlight where the market turned on these levels on the LTF: M1 or M5 After seeing many examples, whichever pattern you spot the most is your unique setup

Order Block finder. It is pretty good to me as long as you start at the higher timeframe first and know price action and you can identify swings on the lower timeframes

Does anyone have a PDF or video with every single type of orderblock? right now I only understand the ones before a big move, but someone said there is vacuum blocks, propulsion blocks and like 5 different ones? would be really nice having them all on a single sheet of paper so I can stick it on my wall lol.

Also I am watching some videos from the guy someone linked here:  Inserted Video

He says to make sure order blocks must break structure and also engulf but not be too big? A big confusing anyway lol, he makes it look easy in the video.

could you explain more how you recognize major fractal soon and trade it ?

Are you use corrolations between pairs too ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
I look at wicks not fractals. Wicks taking out liquidity and zones or consolidation or multiple candles at equal highs or equal lows or price that has left these areas heading to consolidation or you could call these areas zones. I am not using correlation.

Forexholy,

I really do not understand your strategy, I follow you because you are a nice guy and post very good videos and charts, but I have been following this thread for a long time and you have me lost¡¡¡¡¡¡

First you started trading order blocks with fractals, then you moved to liquidity grab, later you mentioned that you dont trade fractals, you trade wickss hahahahahah but then I see you trading noot on rejection with the wick but when price is advancing and on a clear momentum move¡¡¡¡¡

Please of alll the strategies could you explain us wich one have you find the most consistent and please could you point to the right videos or explain

thanks

kind regards

I actually started trading zones rejection wicks and price Action first. Then I started to learn about Order Blocks because of the great risk to reward it offers which ICT Trader is the developer of that concept, which also includes liquidity both internal and external equal highs and lows, fair value gaps.

Also now the so called rejection wicks at equal highs and lows I no longer see them as rejection but evidence that price has took out stops and orders then reverses. Then I look for price to head to a higher timeframe Order Block where orders reside. I also look for Liquidity Voids as price will move fairly smooth when you trade these. I would say I use all of these in my trading style. Now if you are not familiar with these concepts it will not make sense to you and you will be confused.

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
All these concepts work together to make you profitable if you understand them and use them correctly. Also trade at the right times of day. I would say the first and most Important thing to learn is Price Action the very first video I posted I believe on page 2

--- 帖子 #1302 ---
you don't need all of them pick one and find the most consistent thing that works for you you have to  test water

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
you are right you don’t need all of them to be successful!

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
I do use all of them!

Well I have to reconfigure my brain because ICT Trader is teaching somethings about OrderBlocks that is just dynamic that I have not seen taught by anyone on the internet.

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
Good afternoon! can I see your comments on opening positions, and not just pictures? thank you!

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
Sir if you go to ICT Traders YouTube channel he does a lot better job at explaining his concepts than I can do!

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
I now know according to ICT Trader an OrderBlock is a change in the state of delivery and not what most pepole on youtube say it is

Hi ForexHoly,

I hope everything is going well,

Order Blocks and mitigation is clear to me a have study it in depth and Im comfortable with it,

You mentioned that one of your strategies is about wicks, please could you point me videos, material or whatever to learn about it

thanks

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
I really could not find any direct videos of the way I was trading and I really did not know why it worked. I just knew it did. I first noticed this many months ago and told my very good trading friend about it. I now know why they work after studying ICT Traders concept of buyside liquidity and Sellside liquidity. The retail traders normally call the wicks rejection or exhaustion wicks but in reality they are wicks taking out stop orders then reversing in direction.I will upload you some pictures of what I was doing. I would scan through all forex pairs on say a 15min or even 1 min timeframe loooking for good size wicks that were in the direction of the trend I would then jump in. Now though I can do this same method when these wicks have grabbed buyside or sellside liquidity on a higher timeframe taking out equal highs or equal lows. It is a very quick and easy method. Also I always enter my trade on the 1Min timeframe.

--- 帖子 #1333 ---
Hey on second thought instead of me uploading more pictures if you will go back to page 2 and work your way to the next pages you can see many examples of what I am talking about but you will have to be familure with buyside and sellside liquidity to understand.

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
Here is a guideline of what you can test out for yourself.

1.) Look for buyside or saleside Liquidity wicks on 15Min timeframe or higher

taking out equal highs or equal Lows

2.) Mark wick with a parallel line drop drop down to the 5Min timeframe make sure it lines up with the 15 min wick then drop down to the 1 Min timeframe make sure it       lines up with the 15 Min wick

3.) For the best trades we want Liquidity void candles to the left for bigger profits

4.) If all this lines up put your stop loss in using the 1 Min time frame

5.)  For take profit look for a fair value gap and or an Order Block for exit or exit early

6) Also be conscience of the 4 phase cycle of price and where you are at. Consolidation,Expansion, Reversal and Retracement

Thanks a lot for your prompt and very helpful reply.

I see what you mean with the liquidity grab, I have also heard about the power of 3 from ICT but I have to look more into it.

Once again thanks for your help I will research and study during this weekend.

Have a nice one

Kind Regards

Ok I understand the pattern,

You have a Accumulation area, a move outside that area to clean all stops, move up or down, and finally you have a reversal.

In the video was explained with the asian session as the accumulation period, then the price moves above or below and then turns.

I suppose that the power of 3 can be used not only in the European Open, but the pattern will take place many times, and here comes my question, how do you know that is going to return after taking the liquidity? How long has to be the accumulation?

Thanks

Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #1347 ---
I don’t think anyone knows that, you just have to wait till the pattern forms which also I find you can trade this on all timeframes! I don’t want to sound like a retailed trader I think a better choice of words would be wait till the manipulation factors form!
