2022 EDIT: Here are new ideas I had. Post 1 - https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14127956 Post 2 - https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14127980 (My favourite, even tho it does not plot signals like crazy... ) Hi everyone, this what I'm willing to show you is something I made years ago. It will also be something like my own diary, because I tend to break my own rules. Which is bad of course. So, what you will find in this thread? // Please, thread is constantly updated because I cannot remember everything what I want to show you in 10 minutes. Keep this in mind and check it regularly, Thank Y ou. \\ Updated for the indicator (cTrader version.. My own old version, I will make new one later but it is not needed right now) // You will understand why trading ticks is much better than using any minute/hourly chart Different way to place S/R lines &amp; Trend Lines (Only showcase, for now.. ) You will learn how to make powerful resistance or support just by using two or three candles! There is much more to show you.. I'm so happy with everything, because everything is amazing and nobody use it. Because no one see .. If you understand.. I will show you this for now. I can't even show you everything, possibilities are endless. Let's see simple resistance... 1H chart vs 50 tick charts. Don't mind the blue indicator below &amp; above price. I will explain this later on. You will be amazed what this thing can do. I must apologize guys, let me please end this now, because of my PC problems and less time. I will continue this thread with new posts. This is not some one time thing, this will take time. And you will understand. On the chart below, check how you can trade the left chart (50 tick) vs right chart where only 1H chart is used. You cannot see a reversal, but on left side, you can! This is main point here you need to understand. And more powerful the move is, less tick chart you need. Even one minute is NOT enough in these cases! To clarify this, to see reversals in NFP move, you need 5 or 10 ticks chart. One minute is not useful here. I know this is boring so far, but I will start from the beginning here. So you will understand. I can't get to the core, you will be lost. But I promise it will be worth your time Check the difference on last two charts. You understand? I plotted two arrows just to show you where you can go sell. You can see that price is lazy to beat that level. Even smallest hesitation of the price is useful for us. I will prove this as time goes by.. By the way, this is mostly price action. Well.. It is only price action, to be honest. This blue indicator I will explain later on. And you will be most probably blasted by things you can do with such banal thing. Useful posts : https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post11456310

Now, after few hours of thinking, I am going to show you how you can predict and trade reversals from the beginning ! Check this picture and be amazed. Only with simple price action and one indicator, it is possible to get completely amazing support / resistance lines. I will show multiple examples for sure later. Guys ask me any question you want to know. It will be needed. I need to know you understand this so far. Updated post with tick chart. You can see how you can trade this here. It is not possible on 1 hour because you cannot see the micro movement, but on ticks you can! When you trade tick charts, you need to trade them like it is one hour chart. You can see the trend there. Reversals also..

--- 帖子 #3 ---
this indicator looks like a ma shifted to the upside and downside of the actual price. Interesting..please go on

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Subs. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #5 ---
It looks like yeah. I will tell how this one works so everyone can use it. It is really better to use as S/R. Im going out now but will continue this thread later. :3

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you SilentFather. Keep going on

--- 帖子 #7 ---
SilentFather, Interesting concept so far but is the ticks option rather than the hourly timeframe available on MT4 platform?. Also, you mentioned an indicator, I guess all that is still coming..... Thank you so far.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
His charts look to be off cTrader.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
this looks interesting, waiting for more info...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Yes guys. Charts are from cTrader. MT4 offers tick charts with custom indicators, plus you will never get history ticks in MT4. At least I never saw indi that is saving that because if such thing exists, when your PC is off, you will have gaps in charts. So no point in using MT4 for ticks. Another option is to use ctrader as charting app and MT4 for trading. But I already changed MT4 for cTrader because I believe it is much faster. At least from trading perspective I never had any problems like slippage etc..

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Here is another example of support / resistance. You can create a trendline instead of horizontal line. Almost everytime you can get a great reversal point even on higher TF's. I still recommend checking lower TF as 1 minute or even better - tick charts. I almost forget to say that bigger the movement is, better the chance that price will reverse. It can sound weird but it is much better than candles with x meters long wicks. Oh and we NEVER wait for candle to close. You will lose the advantage of zero to very small drawdown. You can see it from chart. If you would enter after the candle is over, you will have drawdown 10 pips. I know.. I know It is not much but the point of this is to make BIG money with smallest drawdown possible. That's the reason I double my account in few days. (Before deleting it) I'm saying that because you need to know that even with this thing, you can get busted just because you are greedy. I will never hide this. It was my fault and I know it was bad. Patience is the key here. You need to wait for those levels to trade them. If you for example get a trendline (On H1 chart) and price come to it and you need to get like 2 pips to enter on THE touch of the trendline , you CAN get a trade because it is only 2 pips away. You will endup with like 5 pips stoploss but it will not kill you. Definitely not. To clarify, you will make a TL on 1H chart and then you watch it closely on tick chart. If TL is away for 2 pips or 1, and you see price is slowing down, it is possible price will reverse, so do NOT wait and get into the trade. It might be a good idea. If not, you lost 2 pips more. But who cares, it is 1H chart and your entry was awesome. Updated post with tick chart for you to see and understand.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
In next post, I will explain what you do if the price is coming to a TL or S/R horizontal line but price is moving slowly with tons of wicks. Anyone will know what I mean? Ask me guys, don't worry I will be happy to help! That's why I am here on this forum!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I must be having a thick moment a I don't get it. Anyway you mention something about a blue indicator …… anymore news on that?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
good thread and explanation. step by step. yes I am getting the ideia here. and I also prefer tick charts. keep the good work. wainting for more info about the blue line.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
try adding obos levels

--- 帖子 #16 ---
It is very easy. Point is that when you create a trendline or S/R horizontal line, you will endup with something like this. Red Line = original way of doing trendlines. What you can see? Yes, the sell signal is quite good. But look at those wicks. But look at blue trendline now. Do you see it? Price touched it and reversed exactly on it. This doesn't happen all the time, but when it happens, you can get reversal that can give you profit of 50 or more pips. Since price and trend is somehow exhausted already. This is what I am counting with. Nice entry with lowest drawdown possible + big profit. That's why I have the bands so much away from the price. Original trendline = Point 1 &amp; 2 will give you entry on 3 (RED) My trendline = Point 1 &amp; 2 of blue indicator will give you entry on 4. (BLUE)

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Here another example of difficulties I still have with this. I mean the number 1. Price is literally climbing the trendline, but it is not as clean as before. This might happen. But everything can be "fixed" even with simple price action and brain. Or just take a bad trade... You will lose few pips. We are not trading on daily chart with 50 pips SL. 5 pips SL is "nothing". I know, it can hurt but you need to take those loses anyway. Still being updated.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Ok now I get it. And although not foolproof it gives you an edge in the market and sometime with Forex that's all you need. Ok so when do we get to see your blue trend line indicator as opposed to the traditional trendlines that are manually drawn?. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I will give it once done. Shouldn't take long time! It really gives you an edge. Plus no one really watch those levels. They don't even know it exists somewhere. Nothing is bulletproof but it is good enough to actually give you a good entry points.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I said in first post that I will show how to make good horizontal S/R line with only two or three candles. This is it. See how three candles with wicks, created a point for you where price reversed today. It is hard to find these, but they are here. I believe someone already made a thread with similiar thing. It's kinda cute S/R. To be clear, one wick must be from low to high and second somewhere later from high to low. Wicks should NOT touch much. I added one more picture to show you what I mean. Check those wicks. They created a point where price reverse for at least few minutes. It can be called easy profit. It is not needed, but someone could like it.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Just some fun on daily chart. It works everywhere. But you would need to wait longer time than on H1 chart. If someone does not understand what high or low we take from the indicator, ask me. We take low of the indi as support / high of the indi as resistance. Just like with normal price. You can draw those as you wish. You will always get a point somewhere to trade. I can create even 5 of them. IT is quite messy, but you will have great idea what to expect. On the second chart, H1 chart was used! Lower ticks like 30-50 are not in such old history. Also remember that when you go for daily chart, you will need to check the H1 also! Then you can go for tick chart. Third chart here is 50 tick chart. I managed to get it. cTrader was updated and we can get more ticks in history. Which is always a plus!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
So much knowledge puts this much effort into threads for others to gain from - thanks and subscribed I wish i could find a question but comfortable reading your thoughts a very good take on the markets

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Interesting. I made some stuff looking fairly similar to the blue indicator. The idea behind my indies was that each candle caries a certain set of projected levels (above/below) that is to happen in the future, as the chart is self-similar. I did get reasonably good support/resistance horizontal lines, but did not investigate the trendlines.... Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #24 ---
deanstar you've been gone a while or maybe I haven't been following your thread …. but I do remember you from some way back.... Anyway … what is your style of trading?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thank You, mate. I appreciate words like this. Even tho I forget to write like 40% of things and I need to come back to (re)write it, it is good so far I believe. I like clean charts so when I am doing this, I'm trying to stick to the clean way of explaining things. You can make a mess on chart but it might be crazy so it is better to start with the good examples, and then say that something is not as you want it. Sadly I believe price sometimes moves so badly that even with this way of creating S/R, trendlines and so on, you will always need price action to filter those possible trades. And I must say that I never tried trading everything to see how much loses you will get before you get the profit finally. But I believe few pips SL five times will not be such hardcore if you can get easily 30+ pips since we are going from extreme high to low or from low to high.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Silent Father, You must be doing something right as all the big guns from the FF have now taken an interest in your thread.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
SilentFather, I do not wish to cloud up the theory but I am a big advocate of Fibonacci. The key for me with Fibonacci is ensuring an accurate swing high to low calculation, manual or automated Fib tool can do this. A lot of people still do not know how to use Fibonacci and that may even be the case with me but it works so hence it's a suggestion for you.. This will be give you further confluence before entering a trade...just a suggestion

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Another great post. Try trendlines if you can. I wonder if you can catch similar behaviour. Also I have one thing I will show soon. I believe we can know in advance where price will reverse. I used it just for fun but it kinda worked. Honestly I believe I need some kind of smoothing because it is not always clean.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Can you show what you mean in cTrader? Or MT4? It can be used as filter. I tried such things but so far I wasn't happy enough with results. So far I tried Gann and Fibonacci so any help will be appreciated. I would like to clean out those blind spots.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Here it attached Attached Image (click to enlarge) The attached is a screen shot of a 4hr window and Fibonacci drawn upon it. Look how there is 2 beautiful touches at the 50% level and fail to break the line. This can now be taken as a sell but if you combine this with your blue indicator (and your system overall) you may end up with more of an edge, i.e. more confluences. Throw in price action style of trading and you may end up with something truly magical.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Here is something up to date guys. We can have possible buy point here. I used trendline and horizontal support because we will see more. I'm also going to check tick charts to see what is happening and when we can trade. Arrow I made in this chart is pointing to something I don't like much. Price penetrated this level before, so it might be less accurate. Most of the time when this happens, price will reverse but you will see lots of wicks or price will go up and down for a while.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
how can you create a thread when you are new member?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
What pair is this my friend? I will look at this.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hey Rafa i trade range bars these days, and prefer a slower trade so set the range bar to 200 settings, moved away from standard time frames a while back. RSI and slow stochastic and then i aim for a pull back from a top or bottom, nothing special on my charts and target is 50 pips each day on two pairs - just like to be simple and not so much screen time .. hope your bagging them pips ..

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Its amazing like Your charts are talking back at us - the blue zones are almost a smoothed mirror of the price action which means when the price enters into the zone it might be an extreme reversal point or similar either way its a very well thought out idea - method which i guess took you a long time to work out - just guessing but i like the idea

--- 帖子 #36 ---
DeanStar You have nailed it. My weakness has been too much on the chart and too many pairs, when you should just have some favourites and stick with those. Hopefully, if I can nail down my charts and what's on them further then can start thinking of bagging those pips. GBP and Brexit has caused me many losses on the major GBP pairs but GBP has been artificially been propped up for a while. It only takes someone to tweat some breaking news (not listed on FF) and things can come tumbling down quite quickly. So its not the best to trade but I guess that's what SL's are for but if anyone knows trading they should know that SL's actually stop you making those bigs pips when price does actually reverse...… food for thought... Anyway lets c where this thread goes but SilentFather is on to a good start

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank You, dean1star . If I remember correctly I'm working on this from year 2012-2013. Wow, it's already 5 years at least. Time is fast.. Anyway I still see "problems" I haven't fixed. Maybe there are things we cannot just fix. Only thing we can do is work with them. However here I am - still working on those grey areas. Let's see what will happen in the future. If you blindly make some horizontal points, you will find that mostly price reverse to another direction even tho we can see drawdown 20-55 pips. My work is to reduce this drawdown to a minimum. I believe I did good job after all those years. However people on this thread should say if I did a good job or not. I'm not the judge here. Attached a little chart where extreme zones can be seen. This works everywhere since price always makes new points you can check and trade. I believe tick charts are the best way to see if price is exhausted or movement will continue. Guys anyone asking for the indicator... I will be making new version so I will share it.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Umm I got full membership after 9 posts I believe. And you can make threads after that like any other member. Correct me if I am wrong guys.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Sounds about right i know with twee (the boss) no one gets to jump the que so 9 sounds about right ..btw i have some ideas for you but will save them for later on it seems its a matter of matching the idea to other things which work, perhaps even in real time or range bars even so two system are running - but lets see your thread grow others add their opinions and if we get to run the indicator then i can say if i can add something nice .. not looking to change or work you idea but i am sure one thought area has been other ways to confirmation the trade just my 2 cents worth of course.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Happy to know I will be happy to know your ideas. I just checked that spotware is planning renko &amp; range bars for cTrader 3.01. They said "soon" but it is already 8 months. It will be worth the wait, but it could really help me. Honestly I wanted to experiment with renko/range bars but it was very bad on MT4 so I stopped. But it can be very interesting to see what can happen with such charts and this.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
So far price did what was expected to happen. Let's see if we catched the bigger reversal or smaller one.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
nice ideas silent father but even without the indicator you can spot supply and demand

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Try OVO.cz for renko/range bars. You can get a 14 day free trial (and just for the record I have no affiliation with them).

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I can agree with you on that. But let's look what I said before. I work on this because I want to minimize the drawdown you can get with basic supply and demand / Support &amp; Resistance lines. Point of this is to make one trendline or support, resistance and then when price touches it - take a trade with lowest drawdown possible. I believe you can use stoploss 2 pips to get 50+ pips. It is all about this. I could not tripled my account in a week without this. It was possible. That's why I am using this. Try to follow me for a while. Or just look what I do sometimes. I'm sure you will get it.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
good ideas, ill be following

--- 帖子 #46 ---
@SilentFather, Hope we are making headway with the Blue Indicator. Thanks for the thread. Keep it up. Very clean chart.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Interesting concept. Looking forward to checking out your indicator.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hello SilentFather, Thank you for your sharing knowledge. I have a question relate to this post https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=800445&amp;reply=1&amp;page=3"e=11322232 Why not trade the pink level? it seems great to me (before it failed of course) And if you trade that pink level or any level like that, how you handle it? (It bounce a lot form both sides, how can you decide to hold or to escape?) Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Relate to that post too How do you identify TP level to get +100 pips? I'm pretty sure there will be some trendlines and levels between your entry and target It's bugging me that my trade go boom at my direction right after I take profit. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
[quote = SilentFather; 11322025] Aqui está outro exemplo de dificuldades que ainda tenho com isso. Quero dizer, o número 1. O preço está literalmente subindo na linha de tendência, mas não está tão limpo quanto antes. Isso pode acontecer. Mas tudo pode ser "consertado" mesmo com simples ação de preço e cérebro. Ou apenas leve um mau comércio ... Você perderá alguns pips. Nós não estamos negociando no gráfico diário com 50 pips SL. 5 pips SL é "nada". Eu sei, pode doer, mas você precisa tirar essas perdas de qualquer maneira. Ainda está sendo atualizado. {image} {image} {image} [/ quote] indicator and tpl please, to be able to test.... tks

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hello and thanks for a good question. You are right. The level looks great. We have few options. 1. When first touch happened on cca 25. January, you can see two wicks. Because of this, it's better to make your next point as close as possible to the high of the candle. Because price will probably want to test it once more. 2. Create those two points and wait for price what will happen on tick chart. Because on tick chart, you will see better what is happening and if price is slowing down. And if something bad happens, you can reenter opposite direction with little to 0 lose. I can't say that your level is "bad". You would just need a higher SL.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Since we are trading from extreme high to extreme low, and vice versa, we should have high possibility that price will go for much more than let's say 20 pips. I would recommend watching tick chart with H1 so you can see what price is doing. You can see here that simple price action could help us get more profit, since we see that price is moving down and down before finally slowing down where we should close the trade. Remember you can trade more lots because our SL is so small. This means we don't actually need 100 pips to get a good amount of money. See how price did a great movement down, with a small hesitation, with another move down, pullback up but price was lazy to beat it so we would still wait. After that price was more and more lazier to go down again so we should close it. We went from high to low on H1 chart. That's what we want.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I think I get it. Would the bottom levels below be opportunities too? (Grey boxes) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Retail traders have an enormous edge against the bankers, absolutely right, We can open BIG lots with small stops several times a day, we can make big money with little pips, retail traders still refuse to knowledge this and prefer trading Daily timeframes. The real edge is being flat for the day everyday with small losses !!! And by the way, the key to profit on the lower timeframes is all about momentum, that's the secret...just watch your charts together at the same time..dont be lazy..most people are and take trades based off a still chart...watch it live, how it moves...how it slows down and speeds up a move.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
SilentFather Hope will be one of the Great Thread in FF thanks man

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Yes, you are correct. And yeah, grey boxes you made are opportunities too. You actually pointed to something I missed in this thread. But I will come back to it. Anyway, if you look at my charts, you will see that these clean reversals happens after market was in some kind of smaller trend. I never found a way how to bypass this. Sometimes only simple price action can help. Just an idea here. Maybe if we find out why price sometimes break my levels, we can expect this in future and maybe then create new level based on this info to get more accurate entry. I believe one thing can help us partially. And that is extreme low (oversold) and high (overbought) so our points must be below &amp; above those price points.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This cTraders retail ratios is also great thing.. Just do the opposite, you will endup as winner here...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks for making me aware of ctrader, I just noticed my broker had it so giving it a try, first impressions compared to metarader? amazing..way better..much more fluid and reliable. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Are we all still waiting for the name of the indicator? And why are we waiting?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hell yeah...and why are people so impatient? "Come on , stop talking...i dont want to hear what you got to say..just give me my new toy..." Its not only impatient, it´s pretty impolite too

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Because I want to see for myself when and where the strategy is valid.. not potentially wasting time by just some screenshots where the strategy might have worked but in reality has no edge..

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Valesch just relax .... we are all quite keen ... but not that keen that our trades are dependent upon receiving someone else's indicator .. If you are trading you must have some strategy, some method already. If you read this thread someone mentioned if us as retail traders can be in and out on the same day, it gives us a major advantage over instituitonal and banking traders that are the true market movers/influences or whatever u wanna call them (scum bags comes to mind but that would require it's own separate thread). SilentFather's idea may give us a further edge, based on price action trading to our preconceived trading methods hence why we are all keen to see this thread develop. Cheers

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Silentfather, What is the parameters for the deviation up/down of your moving average in relation to price? Thanks in advance and regards, S.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
you should stick with the silent thing father if no one in the public net can open/close trades publicly with profit for at least 2/3 months where all the world is watching! then trading is still remain impossible and manipulated cya

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Appears promising. Waiting for SilentFather to break the silence about the indicator so that we could try it on the Demo. Thanks for sharing this method with us.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I never could understand why someone starts a thread to share a system then withholds the indicator that's supposedly needed(though no indicator should be needed)to make the system work

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I dont know but i think Silent has given enough for anyone to be successfull, indicators might help visually but wont give you an edge..indicators follow price not the other way round, stop being lazy and put the effort in learning price behaviour.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Is this post intended for me? Are you kidding me

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I dont see your username in the post? lol

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Wow - this is great! The best fun I've had with my clothes on for quite some time...... Thanks SF! .

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Guess Old Dog learn't some new tricks..

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yup - I LOVE a new trick as long as it's a good one . This one looks quite promising.... OD .

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Cool, mind teaching this puppy how you did it?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Looks like a sma set to 1 offset

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hello mate, Sure - no problem. I just plotted a displaced MA set to a Fib multiple of the ATR. Kinda like a Keltner displacement but just with a copy of the price. Actually, on closer inspection a few more things seemed to line up... Curious -- not sure why this works (if at all) but I am sure SF will tell us soon enough from his research. Kind regards, OD .

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Is on MT4 or ctrader? if its mt4 can you please share the indi and your template?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
every time i read those words "looks quite promising" in a comment about trading i think and say "so wtf lets have another laugh"

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hello mate, It's MT4. There is no "indy". Moving Averages with displacements and levels are built right into MT4. KR, OD .

--- 帖子 #78 ---
How do you set it to a Fib multiple of the ATR if you do not mind me asking?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hey guys, try this very simple method, and the magic blue indicator peaks seem to line up nice with the price chart. Just go to insert, indicators, envelopes, click the parameters tab enter period 1, shift 0, ma method simple, apply to typical price, deviation % 1.0, click the colors tab, change to dodger blue, dodger blue, put it on a 1hr chart, zoom out, and now you have the secret magic blue indicator. Have Fun! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yeah, more brokers is adding it. It Is much better. I had no problems with cTrader opening a trade even few seconds before/after NFP and spread was low and once even -2 pips. Can't remember if I opened a trade already in profit but I think so, since I sent picture to a friend. But not only spread, overall work in cTrader is better.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
If you like it, I am happy. I'im on a phone now and it is kinda stupid to write in english like that, however you somehow achieved the same thing other way around. Clever. Guys anyone thinking this is the exactly same thing like I have, you are wrong. However Old_Dog actually gave me interesting idea because this can be even more precise than my indicator. As soon as possible I will check this on my computer. I will compare both ways of doing this and then we can together work on this and get some amazing result. Because if you guys understand, this works but I still see some blind spots which I don't like. I like perfect / simple things and this is one of those things. But working together is always better. I hope everyone who like my idea will understand that sharing is a good thing. By the way, for others asking for the indicator. I wanted to make some fixes in the code and make the code cleaner. I'm sorry that it takes so long. I'm still without a computer for 22 hours now. And plus the weater is awful in here. It's permanently 35°C outside and inside is not aby better so I apologize that I am so slow. I was just very happy that I could have time to write about this and share what I used for quite long time. So be ready we will all get there.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Old Dog, you probably got one thing right. Good catch I must say. I wondered if someone will see it. And I mean this yellow horizontal line on your chart. Since you probably noticed that when the 'indicator' touched the price from below it acted like resistance (for the indicator) and real price touched the "secret" high and actually went down after that. It happens more often. Just like other things. Who knows what more is hidden from us. Maybe more people will see something that I missed. We created another price - Above and below normal price chart - hidden from us on a clean chart. That can give us new support/resistance lines. Continue like this and you will be making money like crazy. It can really give you an edge.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
tpl please....

--- 帖子 #84 ---
thanks you for your great work!!! its pretty cool!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks SirViver! Tried it. Works like a charm. @SilentFather, is this the indicator you talk about?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks SF There is probably more to this than meets the eye and I suspect it is based on the properties of random walks. (OK - I am well aware the market is NOT a true random walk in the Brownian (or Einsteinian) sense, but it is pretty close. Yes, I know there are "fat tails" blah blah blah but this is near enough for Government work). A random walk is largely constrained by the conditional expectation of its own volatility, which is itself stochastic. In simple terms, show anyone a price chart with no labels and everyone will tell you it is a price chart. Why? Because price charts have a unique "look and feel" that is common to all assets and if they behaved differently, they would look different. But they don't What we are producing by the "back door" I supect is the " iterated logarithm " of the walk. If you don't know what that is, read about it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of...ated_logarithm . It basically gives the constraints on the envelope of a random walk. Which if you think about it, is all you ever need to make a lot of money in the markets. Very, very nice stuff and I am very grateful to SilentFather for kindly bringing this to our attention. I have been a FF member for nearly 8 years and I post only rarely as the signal-to-noise ratio on FF is around -80dB. (ie 99% pure crap). But occasionally a rare piece of true insight catches my attention and that makes it all worthwhile. Kind regards, OD .

Am I crazy, or is this just a fibonacci: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #88 ---
... er, pretty much, yes. But with a rather interesting twist ATR and Fib are intimately connected (for obvious reasons...) OD .

--- 帖子 #89 ---
QUOTING THE mAXX I tried hinting to SL about Fibonacci and gave a screen shot because I think Fibonacci (above anything else) is intrinsically linked to trading (amongst many other things). However, keep the good work up and let's all get that added edge we need in the marketplace

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Another one. Clever! Also - You are correct. I realised it years back also, but I never found an edge there. Now I remember one but can't remember how I did it exactly. Hope I will remember. I saved few "memories" in pictures but I can't find those. Anyway there are few more things to check. I will also show how you can "kind of" predict when/where price will reverse. It works kinda good but not best always. However if you get the S/R right, you will probably get this right, too.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I will definitely read it. Also you are correct with the randomness. Funny thing is even when you toss a coin, you can get a "chart". Of course, he is not first who did the same thing. To wrap this up for now. The crap here is really annoying. I'm checking (Or checked) constantly the trading systems forums, and mostly you get those trading systems... crazy charts with 12 fancy (repainting) indicators all showing the same thing, lagging behind the price... Well I can't say I tried indicators too. But I realised later that if I want some indicator, I will use something that can show me signal before the trend/move etc... Not after. This is manual system but it works. Not always 100% but still, I have clean price. Yes I have bands above and below the price, but it is nothing compared to those crazy charts. It is always nice to hear something good from good traders like You. Really gives me the power to continue because I can see that it can be something good or at least that I'm on good path. I will now check your way of doing these bands vs indi I got. Ok after checking I can already see that those signals are not always same but they agree at some points. Interesting..

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Indicator attached to the first post. Now it will be much better to share any ideas and examples. I also checked SirViver idea and you can get those bands, but it is not the same. You can check now. Best version is from Old Dog so far.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
thanks a lot for sharing the indi SF. as the source code is not avaiable, do you know the ma modes avaiable (0,1,2,3) ? the number 2 as default stands for ?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I think this is correct 0 - simple 1 - exponential 2 - linear 3 - smoothed

--- 帖子 #95 ---
tks Erebus. yeah it may be like MT4. just confirming.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
i swear god that fools and the posters with an incredible imagination to make new things from the same thing everyday are making me laugh daily, sometimes i cant even stop laughing cya

--- 帖子 #97 ---
well.... let´s see : - not even 1 year with FF - 131 post, none of them is positive, no help, no cooperation - started a thread with the name No Loss on it - is subscribed to more then 20 threads - made 3 posts in this thread wich clearly didnt believe So you may ask : why the hell I keep reading this thread. or : why do I post here. or better : Do I laugh so much because I dont want to remeber what a sad person I am ? Honestly..... people like you should leave this forum. you will be much happier away from here. trust me. One thing is to alert people from possible scammers, sellers or things you know about. Other thing is to always try to denigrate others to make the impression you are somebody. @SilentFather , sorry for the "out of context" post.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
can someone explain the logic of the indicator?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
It should be SMA. New version will be better without those numbers. Since I lost the source to this mess I will make new one.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I kinda expected those to happen. It'ss nothing new. Anyway it does not matter if someone like it or not. Thing is this works. Sometimes not as good as I wants but it does. People can try and see. I'm not selling anything here. Thing is that only few of us on the forum will really check it and use it. Or take something from it. Most people will go on other threads with nice trend following system using 10 same lagging indicators called probably "Fluttershy's Rainbow Trading system" and will be happily using it. Well lets end joking and start trading. Maybe he will stop trolling. Anyway less people using it, the better. At least our "noise" ratio will be low. As Old Dog have said.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks for sharing SF, I like you style. If you can have such a small sl your R:R can be amazing. And if you can achieve a 40 to 60 % winners. Than you have a great edge. BTW I use ctader for quite a while now and in my opinion it's way better than anything else.... I use webtrader mostly cause I can trade everywhere.... Is there a way I can duplicate your indicator for the web trader? Thanks for your generosity, helping and sharing attitude.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
hello Old Dog , could you explain in detail how you did it? i think i m not the only one who don t know how to do it..tx a lot!!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi SilentFather I' m very interested in this thread, but it's my first contact with cTrader. So I don't know how to copy your Indicator to the new platform.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Silent father this system intrigued me and I am trying to see hoe to make it work. I Went long at 1.29748. I drew three trend lines. From your experience do they give a good indication where the USDCAD will turn?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Google..........easy to follow installation instructions....

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thank you, but I don't find an instruction, how to install indicators from a website. Only the custom-indicators integrated in cTrader

--- 帖子 #107 ---
with your ctrader opened just double click (run) the .algo file inside the zip and it will install. confirm the installation pressing yes. you will find the indicator in the custom tab.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
It is possible. At some point you will be able to enter just exactly before some bigger move will happen. So you should move into some profit right away when you place a trade. I will explain later but I got that idea after I realised (as someone already stated) that those horizontal levels are mostly on same places as 50% fibo. Just a question here before anything else. If you know where 50% fibo is in advantage, how would you enter if you know that price moved from last high or low for 34 pips already? Thing is that price will and must move for more than 34 pips. Sooner or later. Think about it.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Correct. Thanks for helping others while I am not here. Appreciated!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Price seems to be very lazy there. I would go short if price move up again. Actually every trendline is correct (same for any horizontal S/R) Thing is to catch and ride those with most potential. You will find point on the indi where price reverse everytime. But how to know these in advance? Well that's the thing. This is what I miss. You can see that sometimes price is moving in weird blank spots where you cannot trade with this. Patience is the key here. At least for now.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Many thanks, guilherme. But when I doubleklick the file, I get an error message, that this app can't run on my PC. cTrader open.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Weird error. Firstly check if you opening the cTrader file with cTrader. If not, click with right button and select "open with" and select cTrader. Should open properly then. And also always start cTrader as administrator.

Traffex maybe this one will help you - http://help.spotware.com/calgo/custom-indicators

Hello all, I'm impressed with the help of you to solve my problem. Now all is ok, i did like guilherme told me in a private message: " Have you tried it manually by copying the file to /Documents/cAlgo/Sourcers/Indicators/Price Bands.algo" Thank you again

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Your indicator is for cTrader, I guess. What about one for MT4?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I don't use MT4 so I don't have MT4 version. It is not needed. I have both only just because I want to trade later with new broker but they don't offer cTrader just now because "most people use MT4" sadly. Kinda annoying but whatever. You should get use to something new tho, MT seems old as hell and they never actually changed anything. MT4 is most used platform, but to be honest, it is very old. Looks like from year 98. I really don't use it at all.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Olddog Can I ask you to share your template with the displaced moving average. I want to understand how You do it... Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thanks for sharing , Testing the strategy with a basket style

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hello mate, No problem at all. Just add a Moving Average of Period = 1 to your chart but no colour (see first pic). Then add whatever levels you want (see second pic). You can tweak the levels until you get the best signals. That's it Kind regards, OD .

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thank You very much Olddog! All the best

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Many thanks for this very interesting and thought provoking approach SF. I spent a lot of time at the w/e playing around with this and came across some interesting patterns in addition to the trendlines that SF has already pointed out. I did download cTrader and can well believe it is much better and more flexible than MT4 but, given my broker doesn't use it and the fact that I have spent several years learning to code MQL sufficiently for my own needs, I only used SF's indicator on cTrader to try to approximate the same in MT4. As Old Dog has said, you only need a displaced MA with a lookback of 1 and someone else also mentioned the use of the built in Envelopes indicator. The frustrating thing is that you have to manually adjust the offsets if you change tf so I put something together that works out the offset as a multiplier of the ATR. You can change the multiplier to suit your purposes but you don't need to change anything from one tf to another. I've attached it in case there are others who are also tied into MT4. There is one pattern I came across time after time, on all tf's, that I think is worth sharing. The key thing to look for is the upper and lower channels overlapping with very few price bars in between. The upper channel must make a lower V point that overlaps with an earlier inverted V on the lower channel (or vice versa). By the time the V on the upper channel has completed, the price will be way below but there is an extremely high probability that it will bounce back to the bottom of the V. I've attached an example and it is well worth scrolling back through to see how many you can spot. The beauty of it is that you can put on a really tight stoploss for a potentially big gain that you can measure beforehand. Edit - amended indicator attached to allow for two digit pairs Edit 2 - 3rd version of indicator added to try to get around problems some people are experiencing (apologies, I'm only an amateur programmer ). Edit3 - finally I think we have a fully working indicator - many thanks to Shiva, Blackstack and Handy for helping with this

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Just... wow... spot on reaction in DE30 just the last hour

--- 帖子 #124 ---
You can also use the channels for determining the 'offical' trend for a tf. It is too delayed to react to at the time of the change but it seems to be excellent for keeping you on the right side for extended periods. There is something very interesting going on in the EU weekly chart. If this week's upper channel closes below the most recent HH on the lower channel that would put us into an 'official' down trend.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I spotted this one far too late but since it was an example of the overlapping channels I described a few posts back, I took the trade anyway as it still had a short distance to run. They occur all the time.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Got out slightly early. But I think these are not coincidences.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Still holding this basket Max floating loss were -$890 And now it seams to be going to where i wish it goes to i will give it few hours and see how it ends

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Very strange - tried the new 2 digit indi and it didn't work on two different mt4 platforms on two different brokers. The original didn't work on any forex pair on both brokers either. I'll take a further look after market close.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Good job in this Hepsibah. You pointed out nice thing. I never tried this approach and it seems like it works. Will definitely check this one out soon. There are some more tho. I'm now trying to spot where price stops moving with reverse to another direction. Seems like we can use your points as help. Let's see. Happy to see your work. Thanks for it SF

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Good approach. Make more lines and see if more of them agree. Then you will get a pretty good signal. I did the same thing because it was better than miss some entries. Well done!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Interesting approach. Show us how it ended. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Just to point out something if someone didn't realised. I like this thing in cTrader. I know, these are not all positions on the market, but it is ratio from people using cTrader. Not just one broker. It is mostly pretty same as OANDA ob so it is useful. I took trade just for fun and you can see it kinda works. You can use this with the system here to stay on the right side of the market. Since people do same mistakes everywhere. Also wanted to ask if you guys found anything else like pattern? I'm still working on this so any help will be appreciated. I can also share some older system I had based on following the trend and trading tick charts. It is simple but worked pretty well. I might share it just for people that want to trade "brainlessly".

--- 帖子 #133 ---

Hi Silentfather. what technique did you implement into this indicator? is it martingle? seems not much different for me. I have a good feeld for your indicator.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Only just seen this and sorry to hear the indi is not working for you. It only uses two built in MT4 indicators: the ATR and Envelopes, there are no custom indicators. Could you look under the Expert and Journal tabs to see if there are any relevant error messages.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I started to collect sentiment data from myfxbook about a month ago to test the premise that trading against the crowd should be profitable. And on the data so far, it certainly seems to be the case. On the chart the green lines show the average long price of trades held by retail traders and the number is the percentage of retail traders who are long. The magenta lines represent the average short price and the corresponding percentage. So, if you are looking for a bias, trading against the crowd should definitely give you an edge on the evidence so far

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I am also having problems running the BlueInd v1.2.mq4 indicator and I did not get any errors in the Experts and Journal tabs

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Hepsibah - I know the problem is not you as your reputation precedes you. It shows as loaded successfully and initialised so I don't know what the problem is. Been using mt4 for what seems forever, so not a stupid newbie mistake on my part either. Tried it on all time frames and even altered the setting, but to no avail. Oh well never mind, knowing you you'll come up with something even better later and that will probably work. All your stuff on Al System worked perfectly - shame that came to an end as there looked to be the makings of something good there.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I am really puzzled as I tried it on anther couple of accounts and also had trouble with it. I thought it may be a divide by zero error so created the 3rd version (not sure if you've tried that) and that worked on one of my other accounts but not the other. I feel really stupid since it is such a simple indi based on two existing, builtin ones. If there is anyone who can see what the problem with the code is, please feel free to amend, I don't have an ego - just want it to work LOL. kprsa?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Ok An update on the basket style . Since yesterday ( total of 6 lots positions ) Update Lets see where it will ends

Does this seem right?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yay! Almost Shiva, I had to tweak the buffer indexing as it was only drawing one channel but you solved it for me. Very many thanks. I have attached the now working one here and will update my initial post to include it there and delte the erroneous ones to avoid confusion. Apologies to everyone for messing about so much on this one, let's hope we can use it to make lots of pips

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #148 ---
very much appreciated testing on mt4 is much easier for me will come back when i have some good results that said C trader is so much more professional

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Morning all! I have had a quick look at the code and can see why some folk are having trouble! The whole premise is a bit wrong -- the iEnvelopes() function takes as its " dev " argument a PERCENTAGE , not a value . So you need to scale by the actual price. Then you can throw away the code for switching between numbers of "digits" as it is irrelevent, and reduce the whole loop to 3 lines of code. If you do that, it will work perfectly and you will get identical results on ALL symbols and ALL timeframes. I have tested on: - FX USD pairs with 4 or 5 digits - FX JPY pairs with 2 or 3 digits - Indices/Commodities with 0, 1, or 2 digits etc All work fine and give consistent results. And now we can actually see what is going on! Look at the charts below. I have added a normal Keltner channel with the same settings, and the results are essentially identical. On the 5-min there are very slight differences (due to the way Keltner calculates the MA of the ATR) but on the higher timeframes the results are absolutely identical. So we don't need to struggle to get the Blue Indy to work - just use Keltner (which you can download anywhere) and you are good to go! Kind regards, OD EDIT ..... and as a bonus, it removes the need for the CPU intensive bar-by-bar Envelopes calculations and lets you switch timeframes instantly. On my laptop the CPU load from the MT4 Terminal dropped from 15% to &lt;1% ... .

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I could still do with some help on the Indicator please - I understand the logic but changing the coding is beyond me - can you explain via an idiot guide? Many thanks

I'm happy to see everyone knows how to use the indicator to get signals, make horizontal S/R lines, trendlines and more but we are not done yet. Plus our friends here that programmed a new indicator for MT4 &amp; fixed together we can use. We have to fix some things and make the lines even better. Together we have more chances to find things only one of us can miss. No need to close anything. Let's get better together. I have more things to come with. I just need to polish them a bit.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
it was kinda joke man really happy to find such a nice thread. i would name it a thread of the year even

--- 帖子 #156 ---
After I or We together fix those things we miss, we can call it like that. But for now I would say that it is good thread with nice idea but still missing some kind of rule that will help us compare two signals and get the right one without any trouble or guessing I would say. It helps a lot but some PA is still needed sometimes. That's what I still miss.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
In my opinion. When the price and the indicator does not connect, you can use PA just like SilentFather suggested. The indicator just help to make more edge in your decision to take position or it can be used to set the target price / stop loss. Regards, Tom

--- 帖子 #158 ---
This is correct since price is changing directions on the indi lines. Mostly where indi makes new spikes. I will make picture for it soon. Anyway this Price Action thing should be only temporary solution. I hope. It's just matter of time. I will do my best.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
still confuse to use this, correct me, we use trendline also snr to draw bottom indicator for downtrend and use trendline, snr to draw above the indicator for uptrend ?

Thanks to SilentFathers who gave me opportunity to share my observation... Here are my screenshots from EN H4. I am not sure about the success rate for other pairs and timeframes but together we can study and make changes accordingly. There is no reason behind choosing EN. I had that chart open and i applied the indicator. After observing past 6 months i found something to share. I normally trade in H4 so i have had that chart open by default... I am using bollinger bands and blue indicator for this study. When blue line cross from top there will be opportunity for buy trade and when blue line cross bollinger band from bottom there will be sell opportunity. As per my study if the blue line come out from bollinger bands within 3 or 4 candles then its a trade or else its void. Because of this observation we miss good opportunity. Specially when there is strong trend. But because of this rule we avoid few bad trades as well... I am posting few charts from EN H4...please have a look everyone and if this is good idea with other pairs and then we can trade. I have use bollinger bands default settings 20/2.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
These are 2 screenshots from January 2018 First screenshot have 2nd trade which cross back from bollinger middle band and that is why i believe we can take that kind of trades. But blue line should go along with middle band for couple of candles for successful trade....Its heavy trend which will do heavy pull back or reversal.... Have a look....

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Interested in this indi mate if you wanna share. Thanks for your input so far. Perhaps, you keep tweaking till you get a sensible S/R but I was actually referring to the settings used on his US30 H1 chart posted

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Few more screenshots

--- 帖子 #175 ---
And few more...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Your idea is all well and good but as a guide to help you in my humble opinion would be to only take trades which pierce the lower or upper bollinger bands entering with a candle in the direction of the intended trade. This in conjunction with your rules on the cross of lower and upper BB by the blue indi. Avoid trades hovering around the BB middle line only short trades work there mostly. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Above all hindsight is 20/20 so observe this in real time EDIT: Also avoid taking trades earlier than the close of the 04:00 candle and later than the close of the 16:00 H4 candle, mind you it takes 4hrs so basically the close of the 16:00 would be the beginning of the 20:00 candle

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Yes i agree...will observe with you inputs. For the middle band i think if blue line lined up with middle band for few candles then those trades work fine but i will keep observing them... thanks

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Don't really understand what you mean by the above

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) See trade 2, blue line crossed middle band and keep moving with it in the same direction. After few candles moving with middle band it crossed back to up in the direction and that is where we can buy. To confirm this we need more examples and if this is what it does we can take trades....Blue line crossed middle band downward and went further down mean that it was heave trend....At the first attempt it failed and then at second it went 300+ pips..

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I would share if I could but it needs several indis that I cobbled together that has my own myfxbook login hard coded into it. A more experienced coder than I am would be able to come up with something where you could enter your own login but tbh, looking at myfxbook/outlook once a day is all you need. If I find some patterns as the amount of data increases, I will certainly share.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Yes, you are quite right. That is why the "MA(1) + levels" idea I originally posted is not much use. You have to set the levels manually for every different symbol and timeframe, and you also have the problem that the levels are fixed and not adaptive to volatility. Hepsibah's idea of using ATR-deviated envelopes is much better but was slow for the terminal to compute. Then we found they were the same as Keltner Channels (which are much quicker for MT4 to update). Kind regards , OD

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Not all of the Keltner Bands I looked at allowed customisation of the offset of the bands but here's one I found and got it to pretty much match the blueind I was using. And as OD says, it is much less greedy in cpu terms

And what is the idea of Ms and Ws? (+what do you propose as a filter?)

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I just realised that you can also spot divergences. What indicator you have used? This might be interesting. Maybe we can even get above 90% win ratio. Myself when I started using this I got like 70-80%. Only thing I did wrong is bad MM. Let's say that my loss trade was opened with 1.2lots. But most of my winning trades were started with 0.5 lots. So my loses were sadly bigger than my wins. It may happen when you are undisciplined. Well... What can I do to fix it? Yes, good start may be using fixed lot ratio. Open trades only with 1 lot. This might be a good fix. But I don't like it much because I like fun and experiments.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Interesting point on the divergences. I had started to notice that sometimes there is a difference in the patterns being created in the upper and lower channels where you would expect identical patterns in the channels and the line chart. But I have been out all day so I haven't had time to explore that further - I'll look at this at the w/e. I'm not using an indicator to spot the M's and W's, they are very obvious. It think the way forward is to find patterns that give high probability entries and use the channels peaks and troughs as exits - that way you can calculate the R:R ahead of taking the trade to make sure it is viable. The frequency of opportunities and the tight SL's that can be applied with this is sufficient that you do not need to go for big home runs.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Nice What are your settings for Keltner?

--- 帖子 #189 ---

I will also check later. I have lot of work so weekend will be better to scroll through charts.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
There are a lot of things to come from these channels I think but, in the meantime there is quite a simple, safe way to trade them for small, frequent profits. It is very important to understand the trend direction for the tf you are working on. - if the trend is up, it changes to down when the upper channel crosses the HH of the lower channel - if the trend is down, it changes to up when the lower channel crosses the LL of the upper channel remain in the tf and use all the usual PA patterns to trade with the trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you are in an up trend, previous HLs of the upper channel can present some resistance so be prepared to exit if price seems to be stalling at these areas and vice versa for shorts. If you are in an up trend and price dips below the HH of the lower channel this can present a good opportunity to buy. Use stops that you are comfortable with and ALWAYS exit on change of trend. Take profits in areas where you are likely to encounter resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge) London has just opened and trend on 1m tf has recently changed to up.

rinse and repeat. The final one was looking too risky to enter until the W appeared, quickly followed by divergence. If the upper channel had closed below the HH of the lower channel (dotted horizontal line) I would have been out for a loss. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The simplicity of this system looks appealing however I'm still not confident enough to try it as the signals don't look clear enough to my untrained eye. I can see them when people post historic images but on a live chart I just have too much doubt. Could someone be kind enough to post a dummy's guide with some key pointers as I'm still a bit lost!

Last one for now as I have to concentrate on something else. Hope you get the idea, these small, reasonably low risk trades add up quickly to a nice daily profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #196 ---
You will always have a doubt. It is nice thing but don't let yourself eat with fear. It will make trading much harder than it needs to be.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Wouldn't be bigger TF better? I know you will have to deal with bigger drawdown but may be good also. At least five minute chart or more? Can you check it for us? I have work to do now but I can help later.

The two indi are similar but not exactly the same. The keltner is a wider channel than the blueind. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Any tf you like, exactly the same process, it just depends on your preferred trading style. I prefer to be in and out quickly and on small tf's I can use reasonable sized trades and be done and dusted an hour or so after London open. If you prefer higher tf, you just need to adjust the trade size to allow for the larger movements involved.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
hepsibah, where do you put your stops?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
When opening the trade, the opposite channel is quite a good place since that is approximately where price would be if the trend changed whenthe channel crossed back. As the trade progresses (hopefully in the right direction) you can move the stops tighter. However, I also take note of PA patterns and, if I think they are contrary to the trade direction, I'll cut it short.

Thank you

I was thinking about that crazy thing like 50 USD to 52000 USD in a week. If we somehow could entry on high/low, we can achieve that. Well.. Any idea?

10 consecutive 2R wins risking 50 % of your equity - and tadaaam : ) you have your 50k easy peasy ... lol

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Well not easy at all sadly. But that would be kinda nice

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I finally got time to check your idea. Looks good enough. At least this example so far. Also I realised other thing. That when indicator shows you "trend direction change" it is always mostly exhausted so you can expect price to rise or fall. This could be good if used with other things. Also other TF's since they are always different. If I or someone else research this one for some time, we can get quite good signals in the trend. Luckily enough with some time, I can make system with this on lower TF like few ticks chart to get some great scalps with pretty good profit ratio. Let me check, we can use it for some time and have fun with it.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Guys, I have found something very crazy but also interesting. I tried to combine BlueIndicator and some kind of Moving Average. Check this one out. This happens like once in two days maybe but it seems very profitable. Check what happens when indicator touches the Moving Average. It is pretty hard for indicator but it is possible. When this happens, we have low or high on the price itself. Few examples.. I know, I know... Price does not touch sometimes. But who cares? It is very hard to make them touch, but with proper settings, we might achieve something. Also, when touch happens, price can go in drawdown about 8 pips and profit is mostly 15 to maximum 35 pips. Sometimes even 77+ pips. Interesting profit ratio without anything else.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Can you explain witch settings you use for the moving average? Looks very good

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Keep it simple and stupid ....... and readable !

--- 帖子 #210 ---
ok count me in , I will risk $50

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Not sure if I understand correctly but it you want to try it, go for it. I'm here to make good system for people here to trade. If entries are good enough with low drawdown, we may be able to achieve this though.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I agree but what you mean exactly? Are you trying to say that this is too hard and unreadable?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I tried for fun some trade based on last thing I posted. Will do some more to see if it's good enough or not. I will say now that it has flaws, such as long wait for signals and one little problem that HullMA does not touch indicator sometimes. However it is somehow usable. Looks literally "idiot-proof". No offense here. If I could make it happen more often, we can have interesting trading idea because when this happens, price is gonna reverse immediately. Which is good.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
yes unreadable .... at first look .... at least for me !

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Sorry then. But it is actually very easy. Nothing fancy there. This last idea is about blue indicator touching the hMA or going very close to it. We have mostly reversal points on chart - High / Low. You will sell hill and buy low. Very easy. It is working quite well.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I'm really not sure it needs to be any more complicated than Price Action + Patience The channels make the PA very much easier to spot and also give clear levels where support and resistance can be expected. PA for entry and channel HLs for exits has given me a very profitable morning. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi SilentFather, Really intrigued with this strategy. What are the settings you are using for the Price Bands indicator for ctrader? thanks.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
So far 733. Just for testing the second idea. But can be used without any troubles.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Not really complicated mate. As I checked the old signals, when this happens, you have 100% chance that price will reverse. It works everytime. We can use it together with your style, then it is even better. I'm currently trading it.

Hey guys, today I was trying to make this work for ctrader webtrader. I had a trade I wanted to share here... . Entry with almost no DD and TP also allmost perfect. I will look further into this but looks interesting. RR can be amazing if we can make this work .....

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I realised a nice profit on them both. The most you can bank on is up to/downto the nearest lowest low of upper/highest high of lower channel, especially if the trade is contra trend. I tried to get more by putting trailing stops on but would have been better to just exit at the low of the upper channels. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thanks for pointing it out. Also - good trade. I want to add one thing here. If you want good high or low, try to combine high/lows of the indicator + clean price. This indicator is very good because it shows you a lot, but it does not make your screen look like a sh... rainbow. I did this months back (Kinda annoying) but worked well. Try it and let me know if you find anything else to check for. SF // Oh and also... This is possible trade from today. You can see quite good RRR. It does not happen often but as I said before. More powerful move = More chance for trend to be changed. I mean the micro trend. So when big bullish candle ends, you sell and vice versa. It works only if you have signal like this. I think I can make it even better but time will tell. It is really idiot-proof here. Blue Indicator touches or moves very close to hMA, you have signal. Easy. I had 3 trades with it and so far 100% success. The RRR was bad with some trades because I had no time to manage it properly. But it works everytime. I wish to fix this one.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Great idea! I'll look on this one also. Good job. We are making something here guys SF

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Exactly. And also notice how those big long candles with high power always are on places where price reverses. People mostly use for example currency meter and they would even enter just because they think breakout will happen. But trend will end. That's why I'm always semi-counter trend. This means i'm going with trend but also that I try to catch it from start. You will guys handle it soon. Its not hard at all.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
And I'm finding the cross over areas that I mentioned way back, where a low from the upper channel meets/crosses a high from the lower channel, are an absolute gold mine. I only caught the last one of these but I'm going to focus harder on them going forward. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Just spotted this on the EU D1 chart. The peak/trough don't quite meet so strictly speaking it doesn't qualify but they are very close. It's about 150 pips so I've put on a small trade with a 1:1 RR. Let's see - though it will take a few days Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #238 ---
But the thing is where to enter..... when i go back in time it's easyer to find entry's but forward it is more difficult, but what i find is that where the channel crosses this can be a good R/S point...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I do trade these whenever I see them but you have to wait for a definite peak and trough to form i.e. a V and a ^. And of course sometimes the move is over by the time they have formed but often there is still some room left to make the trade. They seem incredibly reliable so I'll trade them every time I spot them even if it's only for 3 or 4 pips because they really add up during the day. I'll try to remember to post a few as I see them.

You are one of few that actually found something that even I never saw. And to be honest, it's really good. I recommend you to continue since you can really double and maybe even triple the account in "no-time". I love you idea. Will be testing so far three ideas. Helping others is good. And we did great job in just few weeks. I also found something, so making the thread was really great idea. / Oh and Hepsibah I have idea for you. Will post it soon as possible. Aaand I have question for you. Do you trade this on real account? Thanks SF

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thanks SF and yes, I trade for a living so all these trades are on one of my live accounts. I have been averaging 200-300 GBP per day with these small trades and, although I realise that this wouldn't be enough for many, it is sufficient for my needs. Looking forward to hearing about your new idea

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Well done then! You have proven that this is really good way to trade. Good to have You on my thread. Really happy for everyone who makes money with it. To be honest, people years ago in czech republic told me that this does not work. I posted levels in advance where to enter and it was very accurate. However they always lost my old posts so they said it is bad. You proven something else. Funny... Where was the problem before? Oh yeah, people...

--- 帖子 #246 ---
hepsibah, your method is great! I tried to confirm the trades with Stoch (8,3,3), it shows always the turning points. How many pairs do you watch, which timeframes?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I concentrate mainly on EU but all tf's, looking not only for the cross channel pattern but also head and shoulders, M and W patterns. I think the advantage of using the channels is that everything on the chart is based on the current price action and it is a lovely clean chart. So personally I wouldn't be too keen on introducing additional indicators like the stochastic - but whatever floats your boat

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thank you for the answer. I also like charts without any indicator, but I' m currently still unsure as to the entries, so I think it can help

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I'm quite formulaic about the entries, I enter on the close of the bar after a V has formed on the lower channel for a buy and after the inverted V has formed on the upper channel for a sell. If price turns back round, the trade is still valid and I will wait for the next V and add another trade - this is fairly unusual but sometimes price makes a double bottom/top or another LL/HH. I tend to divide my total trade size by three so that I can permit two additional trades for the same target if necessary. TP is a couple of pips below the last LL of upper channel for a long and above the HH of the lower channel for a short. I was out when the opportunity on the EU 1m chart appeared but this is how I would have played it if I had been here. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

NZD-USD Day Friend trader. All systems are imperfect, if someone had a perfect one, I would not be publishing it here. What we always look for is more signals that give us a more confidence to open the operation. This indicator helps in that. Here another sample and as you can see, it is who first gives the confirmation signal.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
It's true. Funny thing to notice, when you get a signal, price will reverse and also make new S/R. Will explain later.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Dear friend, could you take a look at the chart - what was wrong here? Thank you for your ideas and sharings!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I am not sure about your chart but, don't understand what you want to know, I think the first cross or kiss is most sure of a profitable outcome but what I found is that when you get a signal it is all ready halfway, that too late for me to enter. If you find a way to enter earlier it will make it much more profitable. In hindsight it looks amazing with good RRR, but rr 1:1 with 50% makes me lose money, so yes improvements are welcome, ..

--- 帖子 #263 ---
You could enter sooner than you entered. But hepsibah should know more.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
First thing to say is that no one method is 100% but this example did actually work despite it not being a touch/overlap. You should be looking for evidence of a return as soon as the touch/overlap of the channels occurs. The channels didn't quite touch but there was still a move back to the near touch point as soon as it occurred. I've annotated your chart to show the entry and exit. Hope this helps.

Rationally explained : a) when Price Action touches or crosses the Lower Limit of the Envelope 256 Time Units (here 1 mn then 4 H) it generates a Bottom noted B3 because Price Action has successively crossed 3 Envelopes b) when Price Action touches or crosses the Lower Limit of the Envelope 128 Time Units (here 1 mn then 2 H) it generates a Bottom noted B2 because Price Action has successively crossed 2 Envelopes c) the Line Linking the Bottom B3 and the first Bottom B2 then generates an Ascending Valid Trend Line of degree 2 d) as long as Price Action is ABOVE this Ascending VTL - Trend is UP e) when Price Action breaks significatively on the downside the Ascending VTL, this generates an " Action Signal " , then it is time to open a Short Position

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Forgive the fairly long post but this will be my last on the channel cross over strategy because I know SF has some interesting ideas to share and we are all looking forward to that. My trading hero is Captain Jack who can read charts like the rest of us read a book (look him up here on FF and on Steve Hopwood's site if you are not familiar with his teachings). I cannot come near his chart reading ability but I have learned a lot of price action patterns from him and one thing that he says repeatedly is that "once you see it, you can't stop seeing it". And I can't stop seeing these channel cross over patterns. But some of you won't get it - don't worry about it, there will be plenty of things that you see that I won't be able to get. I have described the strategy entries and exits already but I will post one last one for good luck. I don't really agree with the comment that the opportunity has already gone by the time the pattern is obvious and, in any event, you can see the size of the potential profit before you enter so, if it doesn't have sufficient room, move on and find the next one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Having spent quite a lot of hours studying these at the weekend it became clear that they occur during periods of consolidation/ranging. Consequently, if they fail, it means we have almost certainly entered a trend. So that is important information in itself. The entire basis of the pattern is that a spike towards the price has occurred on one channel followed quite soon afterwards by a spike on the other channel that overlaps with the first one i.e. a channel cross over. A spike for these purposes means that it is a peak or trough (LL on upper channel or HH on lower channel) and that it is not subsequently taken out by a new LL or HH. If the spike that you are trading towards is taken out, the trade is no longer valid and there is a high probability that a trend has been entered. Here is an example of a trade I made earlier today that resulted in a loss because the HH on the lower channel that I was trading towards was taken out by a HH before I reached my TP. It was actually not a very good trade to have made because the spike up on the lower channel was very feeble but it is good enough to show as an example of a failure. You can see my entry and where I exited at a loss. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ok, you should now have sufficient info to look for these yourselves. If the strategy interests you, spend hours going through past charts looking for the patterns (I spend about 60-70 hours/week studying charts), identifying where you would have entered, where your TP would have been and where some of them would have failed. They have served me extremely well so far and I am optimistic on the basis of the research I have done but we are all responsible for doing our own due diligence. Hope this helps some person/people. I will now stop hogging SF's thread.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
At last! I guess I have gotten to my final bus stop in FF looking for a system that will work. And I'm quite optimistic about this Thanks to SilentFathers, Hepsibah and other contributors.

I studied the charts as well, and in ranging markets it works best. If it starts trending it is a loss I don't care about losses. It's part of the game, if you like 1 min charts it is better on more volatile pairs... If I can find something to have a better entry, this has a possibility to go to a risk to reward ratio of 1:2 with over a 60% winners... Maybe SF has something interesting. For now it has potential but not good enough yet in my opinion. ....

--- 帖子 #275 ---
that is the interest of Hurst system - simplicity and logic on all time frames when you add Gann Octave to calculate the relevant depth / amplitude of the Envelopes you "know" where you are in the potential trend, and where you can go (statistically) then you can calculate your potential Risk Reward and decide if you enter or not moreover you have 3 possibilities to position your stop loss - slightly under (or over) the break of the trend line - at the level of the last low or top of the Envelope you trade - at your entry level plus or minus the parameter of the Envelope (1/2 amplitude) other factor to take into account : the Underlying Trend

Thank you, hepsibah, for your new explanation - I study and re-study it. Once you wrote that you set SL at the opposite side of the channel. But here SL is not so far. Could you give an formulative advice abot SL?

Bingo! Price hasn't quite reached the upper channel but I'm out as I have seen that it quite often does not go all the way on longer tf's and, looking left, there is quite a lot of resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #278 ---
True. Question Is "Is there a way to tell if price will touch the upper/lower band completely or not?"

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I wish! We'd all be billionaires if there was. I just watch price action on different tf's to give me a clue and my research has shown that the higher the tf, the less likely price is to go all the way back. But no one can predict 100%. Are you ready to share your idea yet?

I'm not sure whether this thread is dying out but here's a trade I'm in if it's of any interest. There is a distinct 'cat's ears pattern on the channel on the 5min chart and a Captain Jack BARF lead in. Plus a channel cross over on the 15min chart.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi! Let me me make it clear for me So, in the situations of the channel cross, when you see some M,W,V,^ or any other reversal pattern and ready to take the trade, you never know: wether this reversal movement will touch your TP (cross-line) or there will be new HL or LH and trend will be continued ? Is it right vision of the RR logic of this system? But you make some real money intraday with small TP and SL every day. So you have more TPs then trends continues. Please, could you add some words about how to "select right" (filter) trades? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Well not really I am afraid. Thread is not dying but most people have no clue how to work with this at least remotely. I accept that, it's ok and I understand it. Without proper rules, people will not want to use this as much as other systems working with trend only. I have some idea and will work more but it's kinda hard.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
That's sad. I don't see how we can have a clue if we don't know what's in your head. But I'll stop muddying the waters and leave you to explain once you are ready.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Don't worry, I was also sad about this. I had an idea how to use your trade idea with something I have tried before. But I found out that's it's harder to achieve than I thought. But don't worry, I will post it when possible. I still like the idea behind it.

I am quite interested in this system. Every now an then, I check to see if the rules are clear at least in a coincise way What are the strategies and how can we see a valid setup I use MT4. I will be glad if silentfathers, Hepsibah and other gurus can help out

Hello Lowphat I know You from older threads, nice to see You here also. I wanted to ask if you came to any conclusion? I believe you had some nice ideas before so let me know if You see something. You have some nice screenshots here because price reacted as it should. I believe hepsibah got really nice idea but I want to explore it more and add something to it. However it is not easy as I thought.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Ive only checked out the cross/touch then scan for entry to trade in that direction. I wait for PA confluence for entry and sometimes exit. i have only taken a few trades so i would need a bit more to try and see if there are refinements. There is something interesting going though

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Ok Thanks my friend. And one more question about boxes you have on chart. This is some kind of breakout system? I believe it has very big potential as I traded it before and it was quite good. I wanted to do it before already but I was unsure if I should.. But here are some real account trades. It is very old and dated, but it shows something. As I said before, when I followed rules, it was fine. However then it went downhill. I did not cared I was losing money, I just stopped using any stoploss and just went on rampage. This is one of few reasons I think we can go from 50 USD to 50K like in other thread I found here. But once more, you need to go with trend and entry exactly on low for buy and high for sell. Then go for 20 pips (if there is room for it) and you will be good. You should be able to double and triple your account. You would need "few" good trades. It's hard though... Just wanted to cheer you up guys. This was/is my IC Markets account. I wanted to change it so it's on 0 now. One more thing to point out. I believe price will go up and down in some situations. This means we can go for easy profits as shown. You can go with (if you are 100% sure) trend or wait for sideway market. It will be good then, you can see it on chart. Price respect high and low on indicator + price itself. So you should be able to enter with 0 drawdown. This is what I counted with when I was opening my old trades as shown.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I got one idea (Thanks to Hepsibah) Before any trade, we should check for two things: We should make line where intersection on indicator should appear as hepsibah said. (line 1.13877 ) Price should touch upper (line 1.14450 ) (in this example) channel and at the same time , indicator should touch lower point of upper channel . When this happens, we should have 100% resistance (or support) point. I noticed it few times already, and it should be checked. OR... Use my old trading style that will give you profit no matter how you trade. You will always get a profit with proper MM. Just use 1 lot all the time without changing it when you lose and you will be good. As you can see, simple trendline will give you great entry point when retrace happens. And that happens a LOT . (Green arrows) I still recommend going with tick charts. Because you will see lot of activity and you can see reversals before it happens. You will feel it when you try it for some time. Highly recommend it Oh and I see I forgot to point to another buy entry. There should be second green arrow. Price touched it one more time.

Because I did not found a way how to know in advance if price will reverse or not, my old simple trading system was working like this: CHAOS system or You can call it "Create tons of trendlines and trade them" Some of you can remember old guides like "Don't use trendlines with very high angle... It will not work... Blahblah...".. In this system however, we NEED biggest angle possible. But not the ridiculous one, of course. All on picture is considered "OK". You can make even sharper and it will work, but for other thing. Not entry ! Will explain later when I get a good example. You can see here that lots of trendlines will help you trade also. I will guarantee You that You will be in profit with this. Since literally no one sell or buy on our points. Because no one even know they exist! I dare to say that we can enter on points where people get killed by stoploss but we enter where most people have their SL! On second picture I captured how this works. It was very easy trade, I made "some" trendlines and when price touched it (You need to enter on highest price possible for sell and vice versa) I captured this trade later but well... It worked, isn't it? You can have five times SL in a row, but once price reverses, you are going for bigger profit. So you should be at least on 0. Not lose, not win. More trades you do, more profitable You will be.

Just trying to get my head around this. 1.13877 isn't a touch/cross over because the lower channel didn't create a spike and turn but I may be seeing what you are getting at. Does this example show it? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Same apply to daily charts. We will always get pretty great points for entry because You can change the timeframe, but our system will remain the same. Price always moves the same, no matter what TF you are using. First tick charts and last one daily chart. It works on daily but it is better (as I always said) use tick charts for entries. And you will have amazing buy/sell signals with amazing take profit. Literally, the SL is few pips but take profit (if you go from bigger TF's) can be even 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
There is a touch/cross over on EU h4 currently (though this will disappear if the lower channel goes up and takes out the spike). So, to test your idea, we should wait until price goes above the latest spike down on the upper channel to enter short? At the moment, the latest spike is the top line on the chart but I would expect there to be a subsequent lower spike if price moves down. This could work well, let's see how it plays out on EU Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #298 ---
You could actually enter before on the high since there was high of the indicator too + resistance from 8th August. It is actually second touch. First one worked well but for only few pips. But You can do what you said. Let me know how it goes And also try the trendlines! SF

--- 帖子 #299 ---
The boxes are just an indicator that show intra-candle gaps. I like to leave them on the chart no matter what im using as they are just a piece of visual price action. BTW here is the keltner code for Tradingview if anyone uses that for charting Inserted Code //@version=3 study("Keltner Zelibobla)", shorttitle="Keltner ", overlay=true) price = close // build Keltner keltnerLength = input(defval=1, minval=1, title="Keltner EMA Period Length") keltnerATRLength = input(defval=10, minval=1, title="Keltner ATR Period Length (the same as EMA length in classic Keltner Channels)") keltnerDeviation = input(defval=3, minval=1, maxval=15, title="Keltner band width (in ATRs)") EMA = sma(price, keltnerLength) ATR = atr(keltnerATRLength) top = EMA + ATR * keltnerDeviation bottom = EMA - ATR * keltnerDeviation plot(EMA, color=aqua,title="EMA") p1 = plot(top, color=silver,title="Keltner top") p2 = plot(bottom, color=silver,title="Keltner bottom") fill(p1, p2)

Since the first thread, i've realize that the best way to use it is that way. Trend Line in the way of prices, than, you get almost all the time the exhaustion of the price. (i mean the second trade of the first picture). Dont like these horizontal lines at all. But Trendlines, in a way of the prices, think the best drawdown.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi SilentFather. Thanks for sharing your ideas. In post 218 you show your settings for the cTrader indicator but the one I downloaded has completely different settings beside even having a different name, as you see in the two pics attached. Can you please clarify? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi Lowphat, Could you share those boxes indicator for mt4? I would like to try them... Thanks and Regards S.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hello guys, I am new here. I clearly understand the system and want to join in. I just wanted to ask any kind individual to please state the steps to trade this indicator in order of steps with some attached pictures of BEFORE and AFTER so we can all benefit in trading. Please include SL and TP. Thanks a lot guys!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
You can use BlueIndicator and you will do just fine. It's almost the same. It will still work.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
You can just check my posts on page 15 and all the way down. Might be messy to trade it like this but it is very profitable if you don't want to think about the lines much.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
You mean the one for MT4?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Yes... Does not matter much. The signals are almost the same. I was comparing it only a bit for a short amount of time and it wasnt much different.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Here is another high probability pattern to look out for. When the upper channel makes an M that is then superceded, there is a high probability that the M will be returned to by either price, the upper channel or both. This is one I just traded on the 1m Attached Image (click to enlarge) and another I traded yesterday on h4. There is a high probability that the upper channel will also return at some point but, given the tf, it could take some time and move further away in the meantime. It is worth marking the level however. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Don't you just love the levels these channels give you. Thanks SF. Here's how the blank chart looked for the recent move on EU. No hint as to where it would retrace to Attached Image (click to enlarge) But here it all becomes clear (must admit I wimped out early on this one and exited when the lower channel touched the most recent M pattern) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I'm a fan of patterns repeating and you can see what happened the last time we had this pattern so I'm giving it a shot with a pending buy stop at the top line and TP at the next LL on the upper channel of the 5m chart. If price makes a new LL, I'll cancel the trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Well traded my friend. I'm happy you like it. To be honest, You Are on great way of making big money since you got the idea pretty fast. I'm really proud of You. And of course the idea behind all of this. Good thing is that people will trade what they see in a books and so on, So we will have the edge. Hopefully for longer period of time. It's kinda a sad thing too but still better for us. Hope You got me guys.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
this is probably not a good example but on the touch it seems where ever price ends it will usually at least retrace to last high/low of env. I would imagine if there is a strong trend it could just touch before reversing. kind of neat

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Here's a possible Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is also a pattern that happens many times...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hello everyone, today was catching reversal peaks on US30/T50 but couldn't find anything better than that. I wonder does it make sense to draw levels like this (outside upper/lower peaks of the indicator)?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
it hit TP

--- 帖子 #317 ---
my first trade.not sure about SL

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Looks good to me and I think should have completed by now . I tend to put in an 'emergency' SL in case there's a sudden big move but I use the channels to know when it's failed and get out. In your trade, if the upper channel had made a new LL, that would invalidate the move in my book. It doesn't mean it wouldn't go back there but the risk has increased and it's probably better to take the hit and look for the next one. Now you've seen it, you will find loads of them

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi Many Thanks Lowphat. Your PM with the boxes indicator allows me to test other stuff... Nevertheless... still exploring this envelope technique (it allows me to stay within my moving average cross system longer by avoiding fakeouts: the trend concept by hepsibah) All the best Regards

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) playing with the settings to match this push. the support areas i think will be relative to the intensity of level angel.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Great idea Lowphat. Very clever.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
That is correct. Good you noticed that you can do it like this. However it exactly proves my point. These I call blind spots. Never figured out how to know where price will reverse. If on high outside of those bands or inside.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Lovely set up on EU m15 this morning Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Mate, you bypassed forex already. ;S I mean good job.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I'm seeing the upper channel break previous price highs with M patterns below. I have entered a short expecting price to retrace back to the M on the price at around 1.1569. If the upper channel continues up and breaks the price high at the next line above before the retrace, I will add another short. The channels are close to making a touch so it is very possible price may move slightly higher until this occurs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Correct it is highly possible.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
hepsibah, how can I avoid this trade?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Please show full screen. I can't see it like this. Then I might help you. Now it looks like bad counter-trend trade

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I think I've mentioned this several times already but, as soon as the top channel (in your example) shows that it is no longer a spike down i.e. when it creates a new low below the black line I've drawn, the setup is no longer valid and you need to exit. Attached Image The touch/cross over setup has to look like below. As soon as the second of the spikes is taken out, get out. These setups are very high probability but, like all setups there will be failures. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #330 ---
hepsibah, thank you again. My question was, if I could avoid the bad trade, and from what you post, you would have taken this trade again and exit at a new low. I thought as much. What is your percentage of losing trades in which timeframe with this system? And which RR do you have on average? SilentFather: Sorry, I can't remember, which chart it was, but it was a HH of the lower band.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Mmm. You have seen a lot of my trades posted here and I can tell you that so far it has been very profitable for me. But it would be much better if you were to share the results of your own analysis in the thread because only you know where you would have entered and exited because we all see things differently and have a different approach to risk. Patje did exactly this and liked the approach but decided that he would need more filtering to make it work for him which is an opinion that I respect because I know that he has put in the time and effort to come to that conclusion.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
2 out of 2 today, yd 4 out of 5. ...... It's is nice to know your exit upfront, only have to tweak the entry a little bit.... Rrr 1:1 till 1:4 this far. ..

--- 帖子 #333 ---
That's great Patje, thanks for the feedback. There's a long weekend coming up as it's bank holiday in UK and US on Monday so lots of time for research and analysis for possible tweaks

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Trendline idea... When we have some trendline and price made high or low, we can sell or buy on the trendline IF there is high or low as here on my example.. Should be very easy and accurate profit. I did this years ago and it worked. So yeah... I will also show you later another trendline idea which does not happen often but it is very good point of entry. Don't make high on wicks. They are literally deleted like this. Because indicator will help us enter on exact high or low most of the times, we don't need to check for wicks much because when you make trendline from the indicator (not the price) we will have very accurate TL too. Oh and don't forget. Sell when price is going below to the trendline and vice versa.. SF

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hello SilentFather, Thanks for sharing your idea. Could you explain a little bit more the entries? I have read your post several times but still don't get it. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
How did you go on about drawing the lines. We shall create a private video for the people in this thread to learn how to actually use this.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Is that a green and red MA made visible to the public to use or is it just private for yourself?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Do you wait for close below the black line?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Obviously, sure. You just make a trendline (literally any - just take the high/low from the indicator, not a price) and wait till price slows down, makes some high for sell and low for a buy and then retraces back up (for a buy) or retraces down again (for sell). Then price MUST touch the trenline and IN THE SAME TIME also be on last high or low. Then we can simply buy or sell and get really easy profit. Here on picture is confluence of few things and this trade would be really great idea. SF

--- 帖子 #340 ---
And one more... Up to you if you want to keep "old" trendlines. They mostly work also. Forgot to say.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
And just for fun..

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Another example of low + trendline touch. It has amazing profit potential. I honestly believe that if you do only this (buy on low and sell on high) if price also touched your trendline, you will have 90% winners. Question is can we double our account in few days?I believe so even tho it's not easy to find those, but when this confluence happens it works. Profit we can get is mostly 10-15 pips. I remember the thread with profit of 50K where author said You would need like 9 good trades for 20-30 pips. So we should get like 15 trades..

--- 帖子 #343 ---
It needs to close to get a confirmed new LL but, as always, you can always use your judgement if the price action begins to look as though it may fail.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
eurusd 15m long.Logic of this setup is that we take trade we hit TP if market is ranging if market continue to trend that we hit SL,but good thing is that market is more ranging then trending that way we have edge,am I right?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
look better on 30 min

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Yes, it looks like it is shaping up nicely. But bear in mind that the longer the tf, the longer it can take. I would look for good entries on lower tf's and build it up in small bites just in case it goes further away first. It is a bank holiday in the UK so we are looking at a thin market that can be more erratic.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
you consider spike is teken out after bar close or at the moment when that happen before bar close?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Silent Father you mention the benefits of trading ticks but where do we learn? Most of us are use to time based charts. Is there a book recommendation of how to trade ticks or better yet how did you learn yourself?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I have a prediction that the upper channel on the 1m chart will reach 1.16314 quite soon, probably today even though it's a bank holiday. It is difficult to exactly predict the price high from a channel level but this should fit quite well with ficibald's identification of the 30m channel touch. I've found something over the weekend, directly associated to channel touches/overlaps that so far seems to be 100%, though I'm sure I'll find one that fails sometime. The challenge will be how to make use of it profitably since it identifies channel levels and not direct price levels and so far I can find no indication of how long it will take to complete. I will share later.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Oh yes it is not so much different. But... Wouldnt you recommend to use tick charts and prefer to ctrader? Because no tick charts on mt4 so could you tell the settings of price bands on ctrader?(the indi in post 1) Thx for your sharing the very cool edge! and thx for buddies here! Honey

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Yes you are right. I recommend using TickChart always. You will see a better picture with them. You will see moves that you will never see with time based charts. I would wait for NFP to show You exactly why it can help You. SF

--- 帖子 #352 ---
ok here we go, please read it carefully and look for yourself on charts of all tf's before firing off questions . If you are averse to horizontal lines just move on, this idea is not for you. The pattern to look for is a spike on one channel being crossed by the opposite channel (the bar has to close before a cross is confirmed). Once crossed the supposition is that the crossing channel will return to the point of cross. First example is of the lower channel crossing a previous spike on the upper channel. I have removed price to make it clear what to look for. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next example is of an upper channel crossing a spike on the lower channel. It also has an addition example of a very common scenario where the channels cross and the second creates an immediate spike by returning immediately. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The second example is the pattern I have been trading with success so far. They are symptomatic of a consolidation phase and price tends to also reach the cross level in these flat, ranging periods. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next chart is the one where I predicted a return to 1.16314. I am less sure of this one because the upper channel got very, very close to returning but I haven't yet managed to find one that failed so I'm giving it a go (there is also the cross on the 30min that ficibald pointed out to give it further weight). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) If this approach is attractive to anyone else, what would be helpful is to see if: a) you can find any situations where it failed b) you can find any current patterns where the channel has not yet returned (I have one on EU apart from the one already mentioned) c) you have any ideas as to how to predict the return time (which can be great, especially on longer tf's) d) you have any ideas as to how to predict where price will be at the return point (I am currently just using a crude estimate based on the respective difference between the close price and the upper and lower channel levels which may be sufficient). Have fun!

Hello hepsibah, nice find. I never saw this one. So we have another way of trading here, congratulation! To be honest I was watching this for a while and maybe if we do this.. 1H Chart SF

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Yes, these horizontal touches are the best in terms of quick wins, the trick is being able to recognise them before they have already retraced too far to leave any profit on the table, as Patje pointed out earlier. But we are building a nice arsenal of trading patterns here

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Just checked H1 chart again and saw this. We might be able to sell and get a profit? Well thing is there is no good level to enter. I don't see any "spike" on the indicator. Not even a small one on the actual price. :/ ...Hate when this happens. But I believe 1.1650 is good TP. SF

--- 帖子 #359 ---
If price comes back to the place the channels cross and it stabilize around this area and pa is good ll hh stuff, you have a good chance that price goes back to the spike wich causes the retrace too the channel cross...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Nice observation. Have you also noticed that any significant spike inwards seems to act as a magnet?

It is very easy. Forgive me my awful drawing.. When indicator (green line) makes new high/low we will check what price is doing. If price (red/blue) is moving to the side we can expect price to bounce from the level and get a profit. In this example buy.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Has anyone played around with Fibonacci extensions? I Draw them on significant Highs and Lows from price to upper and lower bands. Price seems to respect these lines across multiple pairs.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hepsibah, I am still working with Your idea. And this trade is really great so far. On demo! But it seems good. I wish I traded this with my own account. However my broker does not support cTrader which I hate.. But well maybe MT4 will be good enough since broker I want to use is kinda good and even have office in my country. So maybe I will believe them. When cross happened I made a point on price and wait that we will get there again. Sooo let's wait. On the second picture I have drawn for you why I entered. We had high spike on the indicator, so I was hoping price will reverse on the spike and get down again where cross happened. So Thank You, hepsibah. SF

--- 帖子 #376 ---
So you entered a short at your dot and traded it down to the spike on the lower channel (these are absolutely the best trades where the channels only just cross and are quite close together - symptomatic of a consolidation range). Nice one, unfortunately my settings didn't show this on the 1hr chart. Are you also saying that you are now expecting price to go back to the dot?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Yes the dot you see on the last high is where I entered exactly. This is kinda nice little thing in cTrader. It shows exactly where was trade opened. And price should go down until the band touch the crossing point on the indicator. So price should stop at about 1.1650. Indicator never came back to the cross on the 1.1628 level. So I traded short because price should move back. Same as what you did here - https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...5&amp;d=1535367795

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Another question though... Do we take this very fast comeback as the real one or we should pass those? Even tho it worked for a nice trade from the below (1.1310)

--- 帖子 #379 ---
ok, I misunderstood. I thought you were trading the cross I've marked at the yellow line. These are the very high probability consolidation crosses but what you have shown there is interesting, I will explore that further. Your target looks good because of what I am seeing on the 4hr chart, the channels didn't touch but there are opposing spikes around the 1.1628 level and spikes, whether they touch or not appear to act as magnets. Let's see

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Exactly Funny thing is that your entry is also correct. It looks like when good trade comes out, you will have correlation of X things that agrees you can sell or buy. I found that interesting. And also we have this... Another cross.. So I believe price will go UP for a while until the band touches the cross again. Tick chart (1 000) is used on this chart. Heh, I can't see where this cross failed. It just works everytime or I don't know. I just can't see any fail.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I am coming to the conclusion that any cross is worth marking as a probable future target (even if they have already had a small touch as in your example) but they can take a long time to return and so shouldn't be traded alone, only when there is price action evidence that price is moving back towards them. At the moment I have three below the current price on EU on the 5m, 1hr and 4hr charts so I am interested in any price action that indicates price is moving down. There is also one above but it is on the weekly chart and a long way away so I am assuming the shorter tfs will be cleared first. But who knows

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Exactly... By the way the 1 000 tick chart... As I said... It just works... We have touch again so we could have go long before... It looks great for scalping. SF

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Here is one around the same level on m15 so it is becoming an attractive target

--- 帖子 #384 ---
We will get there.

thanks for pointing this out for me guys....i have a lot of fun with it again another winner

--- 帖子 #386 ---
No problem. But the sell is not yet ended. I believe hepsibahs indicator is also not ended. But thing is.. It looks like this happens all the time 100%. And even if not.. That means we have 99% profitable system. We can do something with it probably?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi SilentFather and hepsibah, what settings are you using for the price bands indicator for ctrader? thanks

I have 200. Sometimes 1000. But I will stay with 200 for some time now. SF

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Trade closed my friend. I realised my TP was wrong so I changed it before going out and it's over already... SF

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I've been out most of the day so managed only a few trades in both directions towards spikes. The last ones were because of the touch of the bar against the lower channel signalling an almost certain speedy move up. Thanks Shiva . I should perhaps have stayed in longer but I took the M on the lower channel as a warning it was going lower.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Yeah shiva pointed to a nice thing. I now see it - before not.. Very good. Seems like we have finally a working system. We know what to check and what to see and so on. Let's go with that for now. SF

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Looks interesting...

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Im a bit confused, but thats perhaps only me . Is there more than one system now?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I'm a bit confused about that. And got another question. Saw some threads with people trying to immitate the blue indicator (ctrader) on MT4 in some different ways. Did any of these work? How you guys are doing to have it on MT4?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi, Subscribed and thank you.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I am enjoying seeing how this thread and trading ideas develop. Thanks to SF and others for the tool provided and the contributions so far. I'll be frank, I probably haven't studied these ideas as well as I should. However, I would suggest....if I may, it may be worthwhile to have each trading idea explained in a little more detail, perhaps with references to already posted explanations charts. It may help some folk here to understand the different ideas that are being used / tried. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hello and Welcome. Well we have multiple ideas we can use and trade. But this what we have now is easy to trade and we have hard written rules. Other things works too but price action is needed more than here. SF

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi and Thanks. I was thinking about it already for few hours. At least add links to some in the first post. I will do it as soon as possible. I believe it's worth trying this what we have now since hepsibah is trading it very well. SF

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Which threads? I never saw any outside of this thread. We have two indicators I believe. And those are from this thread. Thanks SF

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thanks SF There is a lot of good information here, just a bit scattered throughout the thread I think. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #401 ---
This is one of the ideas I am trying to focus on / learn. Using only upper or lower channel tops / bottoms to draw trend lines and trade them as resistance levels for price to bounce. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #402 ---
True. It is sadly because after some time with this I began (or my eyes) lazy to see new things. And so I couldn't make any system rules. And people here really helped with it. We have at least 4 new ways to use this. It helped a lot. SF

Tell me later how it ended and attach the chart please. I will explain what happened and why. Since I believe this buy will not work if price touch the bands. Maybe it already touch it, but I couldn't get same settings on cTrader as you have on MT4. Thanks Ezzy SF

--- 帖子 #408 ---
AWSOME Ezzy. Just like you propose, I connected the top and botom channel spikes. I´m just studying this on the sidelines since a couple of days. Check the EURUSD 15 M today. 3 trades, 3 fat winners (did not trade). Thanks guys, thanks Silent. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Exactly. Connecting the trendlines was the first thing I did after I realised it is much better S/R than original price. Later I found other things and now with my Friends here we found something else. And it works!

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Another one on GBCAD 240 Check the power of the move, when both lines coincide. This would be "new era, silent triangle breakout" trading

--- 帖子 #411 ---
GBPJPY H Takes a little bit of patience to find the right ones... THEN BINGO

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Someone already realised. Well done. I found it years ago but hard thing is to get those two trendlines that will touch on the same time on same price. But these also works 100% SF

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Here is another potential dual tren dline touch.....well, one to keep an eye on anyway Attached Image (click to enlarge) Disregard my early entry, the potential could be where the 2 lines meet, a little further north. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) So...I didn't take the bounce trade on gbpjpy, because I was asleep , however the trend line was respected, price paused at that level, broke it, it came back to it, became resistance and bounced down from it. Took a small trade for small profit (all trail and error for me at the moment. I'm starting to really like these lines Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yes, and notice how for the moment price advances along one of the trendlines. And I also noticed that as with "normal price trendlines", when price breaks them they tend to become S/R.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
You also have great GBP/JPY chance to buy, since lower band was penetrated by the other and price will come back to it sooner or later. And Yes, it respects the line, however as I already said, it was moving down because the move up will be soo sharp that it is impossible. We can easily count with it and get a profit since price is not going all the way up to infinite. So I would recommend buying the GBP/JPY on the trendline. Should be easy profit. SF

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Fun fact is you can enter the reverse trade immediately if price bounces of the nearest support zone, find evidence below Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit: SilentFather please what tick chart size do you usually use I have the OVO offline charting software to create ticks on MT4. Cheers

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Looking at that right now. Keen to learn more SL. I would like to keep posting these examples, however I don't want to overcrowd the thread. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Exactly I know there were more oportunities. My tick charts can be seen on my pictures. But I believe I use 10,15,80,50,100,250,750,1000. I can switch them fast so it does not matter, but I would go with 80t if you want. SF

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi, One question please: the line derived by the channels cross acts as a magnet for price. Is that it? Thanks and Regards S.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Yes and if price touch the cross exactly, price will reverse. SF

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Sorry, SF, but I'm still confused about the main idea. We still don't have a filter to know: wether price is going to return to the cross line or price is going to make new HH|LL and continue the trend . In other words: Or I have missed something?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
By the way, My eyes often see a picture like this "cap": Attached Image (click to enlarge) (upper OR lower band "crosses" ITSELF with spikes) I think it's just a variant of SF's blue indicator's trendline technic, but it strongly gives return&amp;TP as I can see. And repeats often. . The question is where to set SL? Not a nearest spike, not a current band price are good.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Sadly not. The thing is that band will penetrate the band and return back. This works 99% of the time. I saw one that never came back but it is only matter of time. But as said, no have has the filter. I believe the filter is the normal price. SF

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Signal is correct buy. I might have a filter, I will check it as soon as possible. SF

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I mean we can add this "cap" to the system patterns collection

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yea they do mate but like I said..enter trades with PA confirmation. You welcome

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I belive we need to trade without SL. But use SL as a balance. For example we deposit 100 eur and our risk is 100eur if we make 100 eur we withdraval it if we lose then deposit another 100 eur.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
It Is possible but not really needed for example if you scalp. Even then if you enter with exact rules, you will be more in profit than in negative balance. SF

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Which indicator is that? I mean, the blue one for MT4. I saw back there lot's of trying. Which simulate better on MT4 this blue indicator from ctrader?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi mmassad, the indicator on my chart is the blue indicator, that has been posted in this thread for MT4. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #432 ---
But then you loose the value of compound... 500 Euros: 100 Trades a month, with a tiny 0,2 R edge, compounds roughly to a million in a couple of years. That is the challenge! To trade for 100 bucks a day?...too much work for little money.("mucho trabajo, poco dinero").

Channels and TL too

Channels losses almost every time to me Almost every time. I use big SL but it continues trend usually and hit SL. How do you guys make it win 99% - I just don't know.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I'm not sure what approach you are taking but this is some of the easiest money I have ever made trading manually. Identifying the trend is key for my strategy - after that I wait for spikes in the channel in the appropriate direction to appear and trade towards them. I've tried to show the strategy in the chart and my trades so far this morning (it still has a bit further to go down). Ultimate SL is a trend change but putting in a BE after the move covers you. Price usually reaches the spike but I tend to place the TP a few pips above as it can stall around the spike area.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
[quote=Patje;11442025] Math is math, you can put a stop, control your drawdown, organize your bets, equalize your Risk. If you then have an edge, AND compound. Then BINGO, you get to invite Warren (Buffett), for lunch, and you pay the bill. Like I said, it´s only very simple math...don´t forget, if you have an edge, run it through compound (excell, easy)...input average number of trades, expectancy, etc.. Simply put: 10 % monthly, COMPOUNDS to triple your account in a year. That´s already ourstanding, some people do 10% a week. Only problem for many, is once big money comes in , lot size get´s too big for some brokers. (Btw. it is not my case...I´m barely BEven!) Best trader I know, mentioned, that once you get your game working, you make so much it should be forbidden!!!!!!!! Worth a try correct? Just my humble 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi Hepsibah, can you indicate what your confirmation was to enter the trades you made going short targeting the spikes lower? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hope this helps. It is usually clear if the tf you are looking at is trending or in consolidation. If it is trending I only look for spike touches in the direction of the trend, if it is consolidation it will tend to bounce between the upper and lower spikes, maybe not quite reaching either but definitely moving towards them. Consolidation periods are characterised by top and bottom spikes more or less in a horizontal line with often not much room between top and bottom. [Read this several times and then look at charts until you see it. Once you've seen it.....$$$]

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I took the next image a little while ago and got sidetracked into doing something else Attached Image (click to enlarge) since then we have had a sudden move up so I guess we know exactly where it is going We are in consolidation now on H4 so expect some up and down movement around this line until it makes its direction clear Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #443 ---
But note that the upper channel dipped slightly below the lower channel so there is a slight bias to the short side for the moment

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks hepsibah, much appreciated

--- 帖子 #445 ---
This is becoming one of my favourite patterns (I call it flat bottom). I am in short, let's see.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Thank you hepsibah for your patience to my questions Now you write: Attached Image But earlier you wrote: Attached Image And I very often got something like this: Attached Image How to filter? What don't I see that you see?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I may answer shortly for hepsibah ... . Many times price comes back to the place the channels cross.. .. Best to use are EU for example or other less trending pairs.... You just have to buy or sell if this occurs .... If channels cross this doesn't necessarily mean that trend change like on your example but price came back to the spike

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Attached Image SO, If channels cross, we have to wait for A. trend change or B. price came back to the spike ? Attached Image (click to enlarge) A or B?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Guys, I'm strongly interested in "SF ideas" and I don't crtique them. I just try to make system from these ideas in my mind: if this can be "easiest money I have ever made trading manually" - how to know will trend change or back?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to find any other words to describe it if what I showed in post #441 doesn't make it clear. It's just what I see and trade and it works for me but there are plenty of things other people post (like lots of trendlines) that I can't see at all. I don't filter at all other than, when I see a potential opportunity, I make sure there is sufficient room to make a profit before price goes where think it will go. Basically, there are two types of channel touch/crosses: 1. One is where the market is in a consolidation phase where both the upper and the lower channels make a spike at almost the same price and then continue in their respective directions. The spikes have to be almost exactly in line. In consolidation you can expect price to bounce back to the touch point until it shows you the direction it is going to move in Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. another is where one channel crosses the high/low point of the other and continues in that direction. This time you are being shown a definitive trend and then can trade towards spikes in that direction Attached Image (click to enlarge) And of course they don't all work out since there are no certainties in this game. But you will know if you are wrong if there is a trend cross and you are on the wrong end. You just take the hit and wait for the next one because, if you take the time to look back through the charts for these patterns, you will see them over and over again. There are also some other patterns that i am seeing very clearly but if you just concentrate for the moment on finding consolidation and trending crosses until you can see them in your sleep you should be able to make some money. If I get some time, I will create a pdf with examples of the different patterns I am using but that may have to wait for a week or so.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Thank you again. I will try to see the difference.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
SL as I can see

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Surprising how something that seems so simple can become confusing when you first go to try it! However hepsibah has done a great job in presenting his ideas in an easy to follow manner. Thank you. Just need to give the demo account a workout until it becomes second nature.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Yes, that one didn't work but it could be coming back now. I'll explain flat bottoms at a later stage, don't want to muddy the waters too much too soon.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Cool. I am curious what have you found mate. Will check at home, now I am at work. Hehe, damn loans. Yeah.. Kinda wanted to explain my inactivity. Will be back soon. Sadly I will need to work somewhere else before doing anything else. See You Guys. SF

--- 帖子 #456 ---
And Hepsibah, You understand what I use and used very well. Good job. Maybe You will find something new since after x years I can't see anything new. Well I can but time it takes is much much longer. SF

--- 帖子 #457 ---
missed this morning's trading (dentist ) and now is not the best time but I have entered a small position on EU 1min to try to explain the logic I am using. The lower channel crossed over the upper at 13.59 broker time (GMT+2). If the lower channel had turned back down and formed a spike (i.e. followed the dotted line I have drawn) I would have treated it as a consolidation touch but it continued upwards and so I assume an upward trend and look for the next spike on the upper channel to enter. As it happens, there was only a small trend up before it did go into a consolidation pattern but the trend is still up so I entered another long at the next upper spike. Now I wait. I have TP set at the first spike and I will close both at a loss if the trend turns down. Hope that makes sense. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It would be nice to know if anyone is seeing these the same way I am

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Haha. The trades closed while I was typing

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Here is another, related situation it is worth looking out for. I call it a momentum spike because price takes off quickly in the current trend direction then has a pause while a small spike in the trend direction channel is formed. Entry is when the spike is confirmed and tp is at the peak of the spike. This one formed after the news but they are very common during the Frankfurt and London opening hours. Have a look back through the charts.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I understand your point and entries. However I still cannot forget that question in my head... "There is a way to get these in advance. But how?!" I can say that you guys can know in advance where price will reverse and for how much pips. However again, it is extremely unlikely to find it before it happens since you need lot of trendlines. I also believe that we can predict where price will touch the bands so we could use it as 100% signal that will give us X pips in a few seconds/minutes, since as someone already noticed, price barely touches the bands. But when this happens, price will move like a crazy. And funny thing about this is that when price touches the lower band, it moves up and vice versa. Think about it. Oh, we also have other edge. And those are the trendlines from the indicator itself. Since price always react on those somehow. You can get a scalp or profitable long term trade without any drawdown and even on daily chart. Notice that it will be harder on bigger TF's. Will explain later. SF

--- 帖子 #461 ---
If you find a way to predict the movement from the trendlines, I will 100% learn how to use them, spatially challenged or not! You have to be slightly careful looking at the price/line touches. They look great in retrospect but I wrote a little EA to capture them and the problem is that, although the touch looks as though it starts at the beginning of the bar, it actually doesn't appear until the end - it happens because of the 'drag' effect of the movement. This doesn't mean that they are not worthy of notice but the entry can be a bit late. I'll take a bit of a break from the thread as I've been hogging it and, given there is very little response, I don't think the patterns are appealing to many despite being profitable. Hopefully there will be some other contributions soon and they will include your dream of predicting 100% big movements

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I know about that little flag but I am sure we can work it out. We must learn why those touches happen. If we know when we will know before it happens. :3 Will try to work on it.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Am very interested if you would be able to gather examples on a pdf, am seeing some patterns but not so the entries you are. thanks in advance, cheers.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Maybe you are lazy? Nobody help with that

--- 帖子 #465 ---
You need to try and trade it. Even on demo account. Its only way to learn it. Even best pdf in the world cannot help you if You don't try it. Go trial and error and You will learn. I understand it is hard but there is no other way. At least for now. Best thing about this is that it works literally everytime. No need to know anything special. Even one TL from the band will help You enter, somewhere. No need to get any PDF. SF

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Not lazy at all, I read hepsibah post as if he was going to create a pdf with examples, I was just replying to say that I would be grateful if he did, I was not requesting. If he did do a pdf with examples then this would be great if he didn't then that's ok too. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
You are correct, I did say I would try to find the time to produce a pdf but I am seeing so little interest that I am hesitating as to whether it is worth the effort. I am on holiday in a week or so and I may do one then as a sort of checklist to myself - in which case I will obviously share. What would be very beneficial to the thread would be to see other peoples' live trades so as to get a different perspective on how the channels can be used. So far I think I'm the only one who has posted actual trades and my vision is probably too narrow. I have found an additional use which still needs further analysis but could potentially be very exciting. But I think for now it is someone else's turn

--- 帖子 #468 ---
HI SF I took the liberty to copy the charts and comments I found most usefull. If I find the time, I will make a PDF, with a list of the entry/exit options, the different traders sugested in the thread. Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Thanks mate. I will add it into the first post. SF

--- 帖子 #470 ---
This is awsome SF, I ´ve been workig on the same TF.(profitably) Now I understand what you meant from the beginning. -Go to HTF, draw your lines. -Go to Lower TF, and look for an entry. -Actually, one could then look for an entry on a 5 minute chart...using a 5 minute chart line, but based on the majour line. -THEN, maybe move the stop to BE a while later,on the smaller TF, and exit on the HTFrame...for potentially huge Risk to reward trades!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
friday trade on m15,tradet flat bottom patern,thanks hepsibah

--- 帖子 #472 ---
This one , like the Odog example you mentioned: EURJPY 15 They are literally all over te place! (Thanks SF,OD!)..

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Correct me if I´m wrong But one could draw some lines on a 4 H chart. Then remove the indi, but leave the lines. Then wait for them to get touched. Move to the 15 (5 min, 1 Min.) Apply the indi and look for entries with tight stops...on that TF, on the same direction. (remember you can still see the 4 H lines, maybe a different colour) Then enter with 2 lots...run the sclap on the 15 Min and close 1 lot. Move second lot to BE. Then go back to the 4 H (or higher?).. Apply the indi, again, and look for the original trade and target. The potential is massive. I will stay with one TF for a while, till I practice more. Just starting, had a nice winner late Friday . My software has a training mode, so I went back for a week on EURUSD 15, and checked the bands crossing entry. All winners, a couple of BE.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
This is the EURJPY 15 I mentioned. "Tyme Rythm Zone" is a swing calculation time/target, based on stats. of previous swings (dynamic trader software). Upper channel hit price (almost by a pip.) My Time Zone was on, and the oscillator turned south. BINGO Thanks guys, this is like the missing peace of the puzzle that I´ve beenn looking for years. (Just a beginner though.)

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Well done Mate. I'm checking the charts for the crosses and maybe something can be done quite easily. And also I believe there are other patterns. Trying to get them working. So far with the crosses, we wait until lower channel will be crossed by upper or upper channel crossed by lower and we can trade if there is place where indicator stopped before. Check this picture for two signals. Numbers 1 &amp; 2 are the crosses. First signal will go sell second one is going buy. So we sell (1) on 1.16480 with TP 1.1629. Easy trade, zero drawdown. And we buy (2) on 1.15626 with TP 1.15935. Again easy trade, zero drawdown. SF

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Next one just for fun... Simple and works great with the crosses.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
So here´s the PDF version. Special thanks to SF, Hepsi and OD. At least 5 ways of trading the Indi.... I guess just specializing in one, should be enough to be profitable. Please feel free to correct, change and manipulate. You all have a gorgeous weekend.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
And one more since why not... At least we can see that we can sell high and buy low without any drawdown. (Like really, 2 pips drawdown is nothing) SF

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I found this one and I'm sharing it. Not really a great signal but it is possible to trade it IF there is cross. Price will not go all the way to the sky so it must reverse somewhere. And these points are good enough to try.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I think we forget this pattern al the time...... Just my opinion ..

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I don't but it is somehow very hard to trade them. You can do it everytime but while in trend You need to do it other way. Still work on it.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I find it pretty easy.... Probably more easy than the way mentioned here. .... you can enter with a 5 pip sl..... You just have to watch PA on the spike.... In uptrend the next spike must be higher or equal to the spike before, if it is lower you can sell on the spike that is larger.. ... Many times trend is changing..... There are days it not works as great but some days you can trade all most the full move..... For me it is a good concept bagged many pips all ready....

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Like this one right? USDJPY 15 on Friday (after NFP)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Friday USDJPY 15

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Correct There are other patterns also. I don't even know how much left... SF

--- 帖子 #486 ---
here is an example from the dax last friday.......there where 3 possible trades 2 winners 1 be .....blue one is BE......you could enter on the green line and exit on the red.... alll trades with less than 5 pips risk

--- 帖子 #487 ---
What I like to do is this... When price get into this channel from TrendLines, we will know when price will fail since it will not move exactly in this channel for long time. I have better examples, but just try it on the chart. Get (any) TL's together, make channel... And when price gets inside, check what happened. Price will mostly fail on high (sell) or low (buy). After some time you will be able to tell and feel it. SF

--- 帖子 #488 ---
For example this one is interesting. I made it just in few seconds. Don't watch future price, just make some points and check for future. Simple as that. You will always get some signal, sooner or later. Anyway let's go from start till the end. You will see You get some trendlines. (Infinite Ray used) You can't use them actually now. But see next pictures.

--- 帖子 #489 ---

Hi, new here. Lucky the pages still under 100, hope i can absorb all the material soon, and join the discussion. Thanks to SF and all contributors here.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Divergences are fairly infrequent but tend to be very reliable due to being based on current price action rather than lagging indicators. They can be divergences with price or divergence between the channels. I keep forgetting to look out for them so I was late onto this one but it was still worth grabbing the remaining 11 pips. I used the top spike as target as there may well be a bounce coming since we are still in a down trend on this tf.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Cool Hepsi Have you seen how it bounced again at the bottom TL, missed that one though... Correction, you didn´t miss it... GOOD ON YOU Btw. thi is fun!

--- 帖子 #499 ---
It is a lot of fun I was in the trade from the 5min chart when you posted and had the up spike on the 1hr (see below) as my target, but it was good to see an almost identical match of target on your 15min. There are good 'clues' everywhere you look

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Just entered a short here with tight SL

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Not this time but I won't be going long again for the moment

--- 帖子 #477 ---
This one is tricky, I´m kind of an Elliot W fan, and I´m missing a 5th way up..to short. Also a stop run at the 1,593 level.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Yes, definitely tricky. On the 15m it has just made a cross and the top channel has bounced from a previous spike at 1.1607. If the lower channel doesn't break the cross line we will be in for some consolidation and price should return to or near to the cross. If the upper channel has another go at 1.1607 and succeeds on breaking through then price will probably follow to that level and you will get your wave 5. Either way, 15m trend is now up. I'm in short again but have moved stop to just under b/e.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
BE is good, you might get a chance on a higher level...if stopped. I´m waiting, wish you luck with the short...It could go one way or the other, good old consolidation. It is restng after those 2 swings, down and up, the one down was in my oppinion a clear stop run.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
stopped out at BE but have entered short again with tight SL as it is looking a lot like a flat bottom pattern that indicates a drop to the lower channel first

--- 帖子 #481 ---
stopped out again for small loss but the level is still valid for a later short. Same patterns over and over with low risk entries

--- 帖子 #482 ---
we are still in an interesting situation on EU. This is the 1hr chart showing the same levels as were on the 15min chart previously. - Price has now reached the 1.1607 level that could cause a bounce - 1hr tf is still in a down trend as the channels have not crossed up - the dashed red line shows the previous 1hr cross down that could cause a bounce - the flat bottom on the 15min has still not been revisited This could be a good position to try another short with a tight SL

--- 帖子 #483 ---
EURJPY 240 On my watchlist. The green TL are Indi lines The red line is a "normal trendline" And this is interesting, cause EURJPY are closely correlated to EURUSD on 240.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Correctly Done. Well Done.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
USDCHF 240 Again the red line is a "normal tl" (note Tyme Rythm zone and Price Rythm zone, plus oscillator turning bear)

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I tried the Moving Averages since why not. And I found this. (Kinda "Funky") but still fun. We would be looking to buy when upper band will be inside of those two Moving Averages. And we will be looking to sell when lower bands will be inside of those Moving Averages. Simple but will be working with PA (again). Still no miracle here, but it only show us another way of trading. Have Fun! (Random Settings now, nothing fancy. But I kinda like the idea since it can be fun with something else as filter) I will believe simple buying on low and selling on high will give us enough profit when You scalp those. // Needs fix tho. Bad settings. Don't take it seriously, I'm only trying to find something interesting. And this one is but I found it by luck. SF

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Check this Silent: following on your idea, I applied just one 55 MA,to my 34 Keltner channels (both Fibo numbers). Look what happens when the MA "escapes" outside of the Bands for a short period of time. The price tends to come back like a magnet.I scrolled back and forth, whenever this happens (up or down), the next 13 oscillator change generates a profitable trade..("often").

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I will have some fun with it later then. Since why not? Thanks SF

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Check this one: EURUSD 15 I saw it this morning but did not take it, I´m just observing what happens when the MA is outside the bands, top or bottom. It does NOT work every time !

Another one: EURCHF 240 In my humble, there is "something" about the MA leaving those bands, worth paying attention to.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
It is. Also works vice versa.

Here is a simple and reliable way of trading the channels (but just one of very many as this thread has shown). I made a modified Keltner Channel that prints a dot when a spike has occurred. The dot may repaint until the close of the second bar following the spike so you must wait for the close. If the last channel cross was up the dot is blue, if it was down it will be magenta. I have charted two channels, one with settings 1, 10, 3 (inner channel) and one with settings 1, 10, 9 (outer channel). If both channels are printing blue ascending dots this is a good opportunity to look for a long entry with the dot on the inner channel as target. Vice versa for short. If you are patient, this is very reliable and it can keep you out of trouble when the channels are in conflict. I have shown my trades for this morning on 1min, though I would only use 1min charts for peak times. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank You Hepsibah That is Great Regards S.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Nice one my friend. You are doing amazing job while I kinda suck now. (Have some troubles working in real world, hehe) I will definitely come back once I figure out few things. Thank You again for helping others and me. Something like this was needed since everything was manual for now and it is kinda annoying. I will hopefully in future make something automatic too, but for cTrader. SF

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Just closed this. I don't think it is done yet but it's Friday and I'm done for the week. Just follow the dots with tight SL's and you should be more than ok.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hepsibah, could be also possible this? Since I did not saw Your indicator and way of trading in action, tell me please. Can this be possible? As I show on picture? Thank You. I mean like.. Price will be on high and both bands will get same color. Can we sell on high after candle is closed and get profit or the signal will appear later? SF

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Wonderful! Thank you!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
The dot will not appear until the second bar after the spike since it is a fractal and cannot know there is a spike until two bars afterwards. So the dots themselves are not entry signals, what they do is give you a short and a longer term direction bias. We then have to make a decision as to whether to enter based on how far away the short term spike is (price usually move towards spikes) and PA. And if we enter there is obviously a decision to be made about exit. I have been using the short term spike as my tp in general but, if the market is moving strongly like the trade yesterday, and there is no sign that the inner channel may change direction, it is worth leaving it until it runs out of steam. I am finding opportunities on the 1min chart every day during Frankfurt /London where I wait for a match on the dots and a nice big spike to appear. Then rinse and repeat after NY open.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Great So it is possible to get entry sooner than with original price. Thanks. SF

, What is your spread on EU? And what is your SL rule: fixed pips or some situative level ?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Spread on EU averages 0.5. I don't have a fixed SL, I'll put in an 'emergency' SL a way away but I'll get out if I start not to like the PA. Ultimate SL is if both channels change trend but since I've started to wait for both channels to agree during peak times, it has been rare not to get out with a profit. It is only when I get impatient and enter during slow times that I may have to scratch. I was already in short before the news on Friday and was stopped out for 10 pips when it spiked up but I got straight back in when it turned back down because the channels were both still signalling down.

Excuse me, Whst's your broker?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I don't think we're supposed to mention our brokers names outside the commercial section but they are in Australia with initials GP and are excellent in every way, withdrawals are in my bank account the next day.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
since80808 may not realise you are probably paying a commission to get that spread.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Yep. I notice it paints a wider channel than the blueind v1.2b (both with default settings).

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Yes of course there is a commission it is an ECN broker.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
It does not really matter. I would say it is even better since with spread so low, you will be in profit faster so it does not matter much. SF

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Do you always wait for trend changing or do you sometimes exit earlier? What was your greatest loss if waiting for trend change of both channels?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
(I´m a fan of STOP RUNS) Check this: remember what I mentioned about the MA coming out of the Channel, and it´s reaction? I tried it a couple of times with profit, BUT, it´s kind of scary, against the trend! But look what happens if you filter the signal, with a STOP RUN: Here´s a CADJPY H chart, with a tipycal STOPRUN level. (obvious massive reaction right after, big boys in action)

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Now look at the 15M chart, with the channels, the MA coming out, the stoprun at the hour level, and the oscillator... alltogether: BINGO.

Another one today: 1M EURUSD The stop level is taken from the 15M. -Stop run level on a higher time frame. -Ma outside Channel. -Trigger (pick your favourite :Indi, channel on a smaller TF, Price Action, whatever suits you). (I just "discovered" this today). I´m going to call it: "The stoprun, magic Silent channel, Boogey"

--- 帖子 #547 ---
AUDCAD H, today. Stop run level from 240 (I did not trade a single one,will definitely try tomorrow).

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Great thread, i am subscribed

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Good idea. It seems also on your chart that when the MA is inside the bands market start ranging and there instead of taking the spikes of the bands we can take the spikes of the price adding much more deals (look at the left of your chart). And when the MA is outside the bands its a signal of trend start

--- 帖子 #550 ---
True, provided you have a clear definition of "spikes of the price". Please everybody remember, that I was just playing around with some charts, I DID NOT backtest mi "idea", and haven´t trade it so far. Also, by nature, it is a countertrend strategy, so expect to be stopped out often, but also some fat winners. So please trade carefully, do your homework, backtest, etc... and have a fantastic day..

--- 帖子 #551 ---
You will actually make more money by "counter trading" than with trend following even though I agree that following the trend is possible IF you "counter trade" the mini trend in the real trend. This is what I did before and it worked. Hmm, I need more time. And since I have other things to do now I cannot even trade fully. I always had to watch charts all day to get all good trades. Since You will not be THAT lucky to open MT4 and get magically good trade. SF

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I know that you get some good bounces when you hit previous highs/lows of the channel (and when the channel reaches previous HLs of price) but I am finding that you can get some extremely good runs with trend and can then use the probable bounce levels to exit/counter trade. Using the double channels makes it much easier to identify a new trend early.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Yes, it's correct. I will hopefully look into it soon. I'm annoyed I can't trade properly now. SF

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hmm... More often I see situations when 2 red dots continues with up move and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi Heps I´m trying to replicate the double channels on my plattform/software.I´m pretty sure I have the original channel very close to yours and Silent´s. Could you post a recent chart (any pair or TF), so I can make my adjustments for the second channel? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Btw. these magic channels are so interesting, I´m sure there´s so much more hidden within...pretty revolutionary stuff, guess weré just scratching the surface, and beginning to realize the value. Thanks Silent and Heps

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Sure. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The darker blue line (inner channel) is hepsibah's blueind, the outer two the ones you are asking about. Edit: Just noticed you asked heps, sure he will not mind if I save him a post.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Thanks aud. I'll also post a couple of charts because I played around with settings over the weekend, the indicator I am using is ktrendtargets4 which shows both the channels and the dots. This is the version I posted last Friday, the settings are 1, 10, 3 and 1, 10, 9 Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is the version I am currently using as i am finding it more responsive, the settings are 1, 10, 2 and 1, 10, 5 I am also using something else to do with the interaction between the channels to keep me on the right side of the trend but it is early days for that. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Cool Heps thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Have a look at what happens when the outer channel dips below the most recent high of the inner channel and when it turns up across the most recent low of the inner. You can get chopped a little but never be on the wrong end of a big run.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
The channels show you the way to go. These are my trades so far today. The first one I exited for a small loss when the upper channel dipped below the HH of the lower channel but I reentered as the way still seemed to be up. The next two I took short scalps, exiting where I felt it may bounce. The last seemed a good breakout trade so I held it until the upper channel dipped below the HH of the lower (red line). If the lower channel now closes above the low of the upper channel, I may consider reentering but it depends on PA and the fact that the lower channel is now showing magenta dots will be a deterrent.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Copy, and at the same time, keep an eye on the dots right? I understand mixed coloured dots is a sign of choppiness too...correct me if I´m wrong).

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Absolutely right, mixed coloured dots is a sign of consolidation or pullback. But the crossing of the outer channel with the inner channel is the best way I have found so far to keep on the right end for when a big move comes. I am sure there is more to discover/better settings to use but this is the next best thing I have seen to a route map so far.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
So many hidden clues. Managed to catch this one and am still in it waiting to see what happens when the inner channel hits the lower TL.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
This is how I understand it. -EURUSD 15,on Mt4,using Heps double channels I marked: a- the channel cross for trend direction b- the first two green dots Marked the corresponding bars in my software with arrows (without channels). Being a 15 M chart, you have plenty of time. Once the trend was established, I used the longer period indi for a trigger, and the shorter period one to trail . Result, almost a 5 R trade. What I really like, is that you are bound not to miss big moves. Tomorrow I will go for it with real $ (Thanks guys!!!!!)

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi hepsibah, can you post an example of this, trying to confirm entries with all these different ways work the strategy. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Please see post #561 where I explained how I used it. When the upper channel crossed below the last H of the lower channel (red line) this is an indication of a change in trend to down. It is not necessarily a signal to enter but it would be a signal to exit a long trade. The blue line is showing where there may be a change back to an up trend if the lower channel crossed above it.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi there, Looks like a brilliant yet simple indicator! Figuring S/R can be such a pain. Thank you SilentFather for sharing your experience! Thinking about other platforms, anyone has found a way to put it in NinjaTrader 8? What would be important values to put in? For some reason, you cannot put period less than 2. Attached is a print screen of a settings screen.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Not only are you amazing at coding, but also are good with finding equivalent indicators! What settings have you had to tweak to get Keltner match the Blueind? I am trying to figure out a way to use it NT8, it does have keltner.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
It's worth reading the thread because the evolution of the channels and the settings are mentioned several times. I began using a Keltner setting of 1, 10, 3 but I am currently using two Keltner channels with settings of 1,10,2 and 1,10,5

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Thanks for the update! I'm on page 10 already and just saw your settings. From my playing with cTrader, these settings fit a bit closer 1, 10, 7. In NT, there is no space to put ATR ;-( Do you use both channels simultaneously or on separate screens? What advantages do twin channels give?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Here is something interesting on a completely different instrument. I have tried the cross of bands on /ES mini S&amp;P futures. 9 points is approximately 450 pips. How far down do you think it may go?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
I kinda realised (I asked before) if my broker keeps the 1:500 leverage. They said they will since they are located in Australia, so yeah... This system can still do amazing things and get us lots of money. I literally hate the small leverage we get. I want to trade, not play on the market. SF

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Thank you for posting your indicator. I am a novice coder and trying to create an alert whenever the dots appear using buffers 0 and 1, but for some reason it alerts for both blue and magenta dots on every single bar.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi: Thanks for the thread. Attached image is how I am trying to use this. The bands are the original ones from the thread. The filter is "saducky" which I think is a modified HA indicator. Will post if wanted. Have other filters but do not want to clutter chart. I simply look for a break thru a well defined peak of the channels. I also have a screen with a 5 minute chart as a time to pay attention view but use the 15 minute for entries. Enough said, I do have a strange request. Could someone add an extra to the original Father indicator. If possible add a middle line that is the average of the two. Not sure if it would add anything but I am curious as to what it might show in terms of setting a stop loss. Thanks, MDAVEM Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi: Follow up to Post 575. Saducky indicator I am using as a filter and original Silent Father channel that I hope someone can modify so that an average of the two bands can be shown.

This is based off of price itself (close to close) so you should be able to add a moving average of 1 to your chart and get the exact middle or change from candle to line chart.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Could you please add your TPL? - very nice chart Thank you!

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Sorry SF but this chart is probably the most unclear confusing on this thread, where is the cross exactly? Perhaps it's the way you saved the screenshot

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I know, sorry. Pictures before were much better... I realised we can get more accurate sell and buy if we check price high/low. But it's not done yet. However it will be clear when you get into it. I will of course work on it. But it is really hard sometimes since it is not "clear" like you can trade trend with simple MA. But it's worth it. SF

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi: Thanks for the answer. 1 period simple ma is right in the middle. Way better thinking than mine. It did not help in a way I hoped it would. Oh well. Thanks for the reply. MDAVEM

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi: I do not have a template for this one but will find the time in next couple of days to post one. This one was made just to post here. If you saw what I have on the screen I watch all the time it may scare you. It scares me sometimes. MDAVEM Glad you like the way it looks.

ok, thanks what's your saducky settings?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi, Would it be possible to also fix the lag with your mighty fine indicator please? When you test it on e.g. a 5 minute time frame via the strategy tester, the dots appear one or two bars behind the current candle. Thank you Scchplendid

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Maybe you should re read post #520 where I first posted the idea. Here is a quote from it: "The dot may repaint until the close of the second bar following the spike so you must wait for the close." The indicator is fractal which means that you have to have at least two bars following the spike before you can know if it is a spike.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi: The count bars is 2000, the ND is 240. In the code I also changed the indicator width to 7. MDAVEM

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Dear hepsibah, If it's not too much trouble, can you please explain the thinking behind the two Keltner channels and say more about the process of how a place for a dot is chosen. I am trying to replicate this on futures and cannot figure out two questions, 1) why is there the out keltner channel, 2) what is the principle behind selecting a place for a dot. Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Sorry the explanation is not clear, I shall try again. A dot marks a spike on the channel e.g. for the upper channel, it looks for a one bar down move followed by a two bar up move (a fractal). Once the three bar pattern has completed, it will place a dot at the spike two bars back. If the last cross of the channel was up i.e. the lower channel crossed up above the lowest down spike on the upper channel, the trend is up and the dot will be blue. If the trend is down, the dot will be magenta. The purpose of having two channels is that the inner one represents a shorter tf, the outer a longer tf. So, if both channels are printing blue dots, they are both in an up trend, if they are different colours it could be showing a consolidation period. As with all indicators, this should only be used as a guide in conjunction with price action. Price action is always king.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
About the picture. "Enter short" - no way Peak ("chanels cross") formed by the LL and Saducky can not filter this signal. As any MA-based indicators can not filter anything because of their avegaging (=delaying) formulas.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Just the simple channel cross that Heps discovered is a $ maker. Don´t need much more, just to be there at the right time. Range markets will produce only small loosers or BE. This is a USDCHF 15M from yesterday

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Once you know wich side of the market to trade, (after a channel cross.) Then, you can apply whatever suits you to enter (and exit). IchimokusewavesfibostochastosmacdosPricaActionmovianaveragostrendlineos... You can even go to a smaller TF and look for the next channel break there..

--- 帖子 #593 ---
This is exactly right. Or you can use the channel cross as confirmation of something e.g. I mainly use raw price action these days and the channels and crosses help to let me know if price is currently in consolidation or a trend and, if in a trend it will help to keep me in for longer. As I have said several times before, M and W patterns seem much clearer in the channels.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Would you be so kind as to provide the settings for the indicators which you have applied in your diagram post please?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I use Dynamic Trader software, with Keltner Channels.(see picture) Settings are "similar" to the ones posted in this thread. Original settigs (Silent) are from cTrader There´s a latest version of cTrader: https://financefeeds.com/newest-vers...hart-features/

--- 帖子 #596 ---
That is very kind and helpful, thank you!

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Putting it into context We have seen many ways of using the channels in the thread but I believe that one of the most effective uses for me is using them in conjunction with PA. My loose definition of PA here means recognising where in a PA cycle you are (which can be any tf but works best if you know the cycles above your chosen tf as well) and then recognising the give away patterns that show intention of direction. Price moves in a very consistent manner from consolidation to trend (generally three pushes/legs) to consolidation etc. The periods of consolidation are where transactions are being accumulated in order to push the price in a given direction. Give away clues as to the future direction can be seen in the pins (long wicks) and in price formations like Ws at the bottom and Ms at the top. With the channels I can now see much more clearly when price is in consolidation and when it has moved into a trend and it then becomes much easier for me to see and count the three pushes and gives earlier clues as to when the leg may be running out of steam. I missed this morning's big move unfortunately as I was out but this is a recent couple of trades I have just closed. 1. I am looking to see if it is still in consolidation and the channel crossed up so it is likely we are in a new up trend but I need more confirmation that this is not the top of a consolidation channel 2. The large bar labelled push1 which gives me confirmation that this is a new up trend. I now need to wait for signs that the next push may be coming and the big bull pins give me a good indication that upside accumulation is going on so I enter. 3. Sure enough push2 comes along and so I need to look for when to exit without leaving too much on the table and I do this when I see price hitting the previous peaks of the upper channel. Usually I would have waited for bear pins to start appearing but using the channels gets me out actually in the first pin. 4. now I wait for bull pins to appear again to show me that leg 3 may be coming etc. So the channels have really aided what I am usually looking for by confirming the direction, helping to identify the legs and showing an ideal exit point. And if I have counted incorrectly a new cross over to the downside will get me out.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Right on Heps!! I´m an Elliot Wave fan, look at the similar results from this other perspective. Your legs are my waves. Dynamic Trader Software, marked the "maximum" Time and Price are for the end of wave 5, in advance.(pink square). Easier said that done, I was also away today, but did manange a winner on AUDCAD 5 m. Still learning here...

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Great! I'm a follower of Captain Jack who only looks for three legs but I must admit I often see more. But it doesn't much matter if there are at least three and you can then start looking for the signs of a turn. And the channels certainly add another valuable tool to the box.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Exactly, impulsive waves are only 3 (2 and 4 are only correction to the other ones). And yes, sometimes there´s more...(market doesn´t read books.) As always, it´s a matter of adding up odds on your favour.

Thank you, kind sir hepsibah! I've been rereading and thinking about what you wrote. Can you elaborate on the significance of a fractal, especially it's use for trading?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
If you do a search either on Google or probably within FF, you will find a great deal on fractals, particularly by a chap called Bill Williams. And you will see that there is a standard indicator om mt4 under the Bill Williams set.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
This is a new topic for me. Let's see if I am getting it right. When there is a fractal, combined with Kelltner, there is a strong possibility that the price will go to the level of the corresponding Kelltner, so-called "dot". Am I right? What else am I missing?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Not really sure I never tried Fractals with this but it can be interesting. But first you should at least read about them.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hey, guys. Your indicator has great potential. I use it to trade in +. Just need a bit of work still.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
What way you trade it? SF

--- 帖子 #610 ---
The indicator shows the value-at the close of the candle. And You start with him. Right? And if you pay attention to the whole candle? And see-then this value on the indicator? Hard to see... I'm tormented, but it works.... You can ease the task for yourself. You need to make the indicator remember the maximum value at the top and bottom. Who can help us with this?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I found some old pictures. Check this one out: Price mostly come back to those places where indicator came back and made a sharp edge. Then you can go buy there in up trend and vice versa... Got it? It's simple and profitable, too. SF!

Nah, one guy was kinda agressive to my girlfriend so I came and kinda kicked him down to the floor and I probably took him somehow and broke my hand thx to it. But... It worth it. I got angry since this is same for like year or so. I'm very patient but not for unlimited time. Sadly even I ended badly, to say it like that. Well s**t happens always. :/ Hope to get better soon since I really want to get things done and share something new. SF

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Just a quick note... Emmm, new update for cTrader came out for all (I believe.. At least I with IC got it) so You guys can try renko or range bars with my WIP system. On picture is renko "5". It was simple try it now idea since I was waiting for this update for some time already. It took literally months. So! Because we should be WITHOUT any market noise, price should respect those levels more accurately. Will check on this later. We will need to adapt it to those new charts. They changed cTrader a bit but we can get used to it I believe. It's kinda cool. SF

Hey, this is not BB indicator. I will continue to work with this later. Got some other things to do. This is not 100% how I wanted it. Work is done from 70-80% now. Something is still missing as I already stated before. Do I know what? Maybe. Give me time guys. I'll get this one done soon.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi SF, have you done what you liked to do?!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi all, Let's continue with other ideas. Here's simple TMA with offset. Added with our "blue indicator". I added multiple instances of it. (for some reason.. will explain later) SF

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Next idea... Working and does not repaint, however, this will plot 1 signal per X days... Or... multiple signals, but tick chart must be used. On 1H chart you will get 1 signal a month... That was more of a joke, but in reality this will happen, sadly.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
This is what I can call spider trading. Let's say you are shooting webs. (I know its disgusting crazy chart). Instead of basic way of making trendlines, let's make them from the TMA indicator with source on "blue indicator". Some good sell/buy points will be revealed. Sorry for amazingly awful chart, however thats why it is called spider trading. I really can't think of any other name. Simple price action must be used when doing this. Some TL's work, some don't. We are doing this to make some map where price can reverse and then act. SF

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Now for those wondering, why I have multiple instances of my indi?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
However that does not mean price will reverse and go somewhere else... Trade can be stopped if it goes against the plan... SF

When HMA 200 applied on low of price, we can get some amazing signals with literally 0 drawdown. This one is buy, of course. I did not took this trade. I was just measuring TP's. SF

After l those years, you're right. This system is very complex because there are tons of things you can do. Trader must take what he likes the best and use it. It's the same one blue indicator, but thousands usages. One simply cannot catch everything. If we were robots for example, well things could go much better and faster.
