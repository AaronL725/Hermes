Hi.

No big introduction, no stories about my trading or personal life, no long posts about subjective theories or techniques.

I just want to show you an easy system in which I'm working and I hope that with everyone's help, we can improve it.

We all know that grids and martingales are dangerous, but please abstain from making comments debating whether these techniques are good or bad and focus on the system.

You all are welcome and feel free to writing your suggestions or critical.

Basic example for entry criteria.

Just use a indicator that draw a 10 pips grid.

Buy: When price comes from above and touch a grid level (level 1)

TP: Next level (10 pips)

If the price drops 10 pips, add a buy (level 2) ... set all TPs at level 1

If the price drops 10 pips more, add a buy (level 3) ... set all TPs at level 1

Sell: When price comes from below and touch a grid level (level 1)

TP: Next level (10 pips).

If the price rises 10 pips, add a buy (level 2) ... set all TPs at level 1

If the price rises 10 pips more, add a buy (level 3) ... set all TPs at level 1

http://oi58.tinypic.com/25jz1h1.jpg

This is another example of "Basic entries" when our martingale and hedging are not necessary to use yet, only grids.

I think this time will be quite clear, I do not know how to simplify it more

http://oi61.tinypic.com/505p5g.jpg

That's the most easy situation.

Let see another easy situation, let's call it "Hedge x2"

Now we have our grid of sells on Level 4 so without close the sells ....

1. We will open only buys doubling the last lote.

2. If the price go against, we add up to 2 grid levels more with the same lote size.

3. We will close all buys and sells when we reach 100 pips or more.

http://oi62.tinypic.com/9t0gn9.jpg

Until now those are very easy situations.

Later we well see some more complicate.

In advance I will say that this system have a percent equity SL and a different equity TP target, depending on the hedge multiplier. The biggest the hedge multipler, the biggest the gain.

Let see now "Hedge x4"

1. Price reach the level 4 so we start with x2 buys and get some profit, but .....

2. The price has retraced to our x1 grid sells, so the TP for x1 trades is reached and now we have 3 x 2 trades in the air

3. To avoid a possible range, we will wait for the price moves one more level.

4. Then we will start with x4 sells until get our target. In case of a "Hedge x4" we need 250 pips or more to close all the trades.

http://oi58.tinypic.com/w7y7nt.jpg

I will show you now when the separation between opened grids is 30 pips or more. We will call to this example "Hedge x4 Inside Grid".

1. We have 2 opposite grids opened (3 x1 buys and 3 x2 sells). At this point some x2 sells have been closed already ( 5 sells x 2 = 100 pips )

2. The separation between the grid level 3 of opened buys and lgrid evel 3 of opened sells is 30 pips.

3. The price back up to the middle of the grids separation. In this case the middle would be 15 pips, so we consider the level closest to buys to start with x4 trades.

4. At some point the price reach or x1 buys TP and are closed.( 3 buys x 1 = 30 pips )

5. We still open x4 buys until get our 250 pips or more target.

http://oi61.tinypic.com/2edxmok.jpg

Here is the "Hedge x16 Inside Grid" example. I think the picture speak by itself.

1000 pips or more target for this example, by the way.

http://oi58.tinypic.com/2zqssn9.jpg

When we have an inside grid opened, we will wait for the outside grid to close, in this case the x8 buys, to open a new x32 grid.

This is the "Hedge x32 inside grid" .... 5.000+ pips DD.

Maybe it would be a good idea to start with the next level 10 pips away fom inside grid get TP, and not wait for a side level to get TP.

http://oi58.tinypic.com/2mg5y0y.jpg

This is a modification of the system by Paracelsus (FxMasterGuru) ...

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...99#post7662999

Some "brainstorming" ideas for further experimentations:

1. First batch entry is in "trend direction":

Buy: When price comes from BELOW and touch a grid level (level 1)
Sell: When price comes from ABOVE and touch a grid level (level 1)

Reasoning: To keep "friendship with the trend" starting from Level1 of Original Batch. (All further "H" Level entries are in "trend direction", so why not first one, too?)

2. Not moving original TP levels when Level2 and Level3 trades are activated.

TP: Next level (10 pips)

If the price drops 10 pips, add a buy (level 2) ... keep TP

If the price drops 10 pips more, add a buy (level 3) ... keep TP

Reasoning: Just by keeping the original TP, we can DOUBLE the profit of each Original Batch (after Level3 entry).

For example:

Moving TP to Level1: Level1+Level2+Level3 PT = 0 + 10 + 20 = +30 pips
Keeping original TP:  Level1+Level2+Level3 PT = 10 + 20 + 30= +60 pips

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...50#post7699050

Also, one more idea: Taking profits and reentering with the same lot size at each grid-step burns up lots of spreads and commissions, which add up. To avoid "feeding the beasts" (i.e. the brokers) excessively repeated reentries, I suggest NOT TO CLOSE the very first trades of each smaller batches, but letting them ride and adding the 2nd and 3rd steps after a 10 pips (grid size) retracement as usual.

It gives the same exact equity gain/loss at each level as the original strategy but without closing and opening trades at each level. Considering a 1.2 pips ECN expense at each grid step, it can mean 12 pips saving on a 100 pip move, which is about 12% cost saving. Not insignificant. Also, as "butterfly effect" happens also in trading, this small, but significant cost saving can mean the difference between being able close a "basket" before a major market turn and before a higher Hedge level would kick in.

That's the most easy situation. In following posts we will see what happens if the price drops or rises to Level 4

Hi,

Hope we`ll find the right strategy,

ronichimo

--- 帖子 #4 ---
and so? what is this system?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
U looks old member on ff... so expecting some good strategy from you. Not like those other having color full indicators with never ending modifications.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi ronichimo, welcome to the thread. I hope so too.

Let's work together and have fun.

how to change tp with an ea when next pending order tigger

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi 24hrs, welcome to the thread.

This is a WIP system with big possibilities to improve it.

Let see what happen.

No indis by the way, just one to trace the gid levels if needed.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
that's all your strategy?? or  do you have something more?

For sure with this kind of grid you account will blow in less of 1 month....firstly would be better 30 or 40 pips interval, but it doesn't work for the same.

i like a lot the idea of the grid, by the way till now i didn't find something who really work well.

i had an idea for  a grid , soon i will show you...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi gridmaster, welcome to the thread.

Definitely, to work with this system it would be necessary to make an EA because it would be running constantly 24h, but for now I prefer to orient the thread just to design a good logic.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Nepul, welcome to the thread.

As I have said before "That's the most easy situation. In following posts we will see what happens if the price drops or rises to Level 4". So be patient.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
i know an cheep vps 4 $ to 10 $ / per month vps.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
i tell u a simple stategy having little risk but if u make an ea which change tp or sl . then no risk. in this picher u  price range is 1.28900 to 1.28500 u just open buy and sell order on each level and same. supoose u chose 4 level means u can put 4 buy and 4 sell between 1.28900 to 1.28500 . that is simple . when u think the price moov one side enough . then put breackeven on winning trade. now price slowly slowly move reverse ur winning trade breack on breck even and loosing trade become winning. .

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I am risking saying that this system is quite a lot like the "Grid Trend Multiplier" of Expert4X. They sell an EA on the strategy, but I am trading it manually on a micro account. Interesting, but you must be very careful with your money management, more than with conventional systems.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
maybe this is what you're talking...it's work in range, but not in trend, but maybe with your modification abour the breakeven something can change...

gridmaster, chamane, Nepul, thanks for your posts, but this is not my strategy.

Let's focus in this project to not detract the thread.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #18 ---

I do not know if you guys are understanding or are interested on this system, so let me know you opinion and I will post more situations tomorrow.

Thanks to all.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
thanks you to share your strategy...

by the way i dont know others people, but the way you 're explaining it i dont understand nothing....

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanks Nepul.

Let me know what are you questions, I will try to answer you.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
ok let me know if i understood well...

if you're buying when price reach 4 levels you will sell with double size, same for 5 levels, until reach the profit point.(you will have 3 buy, and 4 sell)

if price go again up you will add buy to 3-2-1 levels for the same first size...until it reach the profit point (as you said > 250)

right?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
You mean in the "Hedge x4" example, right?. I'll try to explain you.

1. First we have a 3 sells level grid with (x1 lot).

2. the price reach level 4, so we start to buy (x2 lot). In this example we get 2 buys (x2 lot) profit and them when the price goes down we have 3 buys(x2 lot) in the air.

3. The price back to the first grid, so we close this grid (x1 grid). At this point we have 3 buys (x2)

4, We will wait one more level to open new sells (x4 lot) ... until reach our target

In those examples we never have more than 3 sells and 3 buys opened at the same time.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
okok,this time i think understood...

only one thing, when you close first grid,  cause the second is appearing, you will close it in loss?

is the first time i hear this kind of grid....did you backtest manually or through an ea?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
No, the first grid is closed when the TP is reached (when the price back down). You only close with losses when our equity has reached our risk %.

This is a WOP and I have backtested manually just some months, but looks nice.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
i will backtest with the forex simulator

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Interesting Kfx.

I'll do some calculations this weekend.

I'll use a bit bigger grid size though to reduce spread costs.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Kfx,

So on your 2x and 4x you keep your 1x's open until you get the 100 or 250 pips from the 2x's or 4x's, then close the 1x's, is that correct.

But you close the 2x's and 4x's according to base rules along the way.  You're just keeping track of the pips gained so you know when to close the 1x's?

Another question...after hitting TP, let's say at 1.3400 do you immediately use that for your next buy/sell or wait to you hit 1.3410 or 1.3490?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi str, Welcome to the thread.

I hope you find something interesting.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi spyderman, welcome to the thread.

On 2x I keep open the 1x's until get 100 pips or more, but on 4x close the 1x's by TP because the price go back.

Yes to your second question, I inmediatly open another trade when TP is reached.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
So to be clear, when you say 100 pips or more, that is the total of all your closed 2x trades taken since the opening of the three 1x's

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hehhehehehhehehehehe, well said man, I wonder why dey didn't name it colour factory. Seriously, I don't mean to be Negative, but still Havnt seen a system that is profitable in all market conditions. Wish u well in ur New Thread, I will be keeping an eye

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yes, all complete trade group 1x's + 2x's.

In the example .... 1x's = -210 pips and 2x's = +320 ... Total = 110 pips

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi francisakz, welcome to the thread.

I hope too we can find the H.G. or semi H.G. hahaha.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
So what about a situation like so where your 2x's go against and you need to enter a 4x before you get to the 1x TP

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Kfx. I'm trying to understand your strategy.

Sell case: "When price comes from below and touch a grid level (level 1) TP: Next level (10 pips). If the price rises 10 pips, add a buy (level 2)"....second trade buy or  sell? So third trade: buy or sell?

Thks.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Nice spyderman.

You have to wait until 3 opened 1x's closes on TP @1.21900

Then, you open new 4x's sells if the price moves down 1 more level (@1.21800)

Anyway ... I have to post more examples because the rules change when the separation bettwen grids is 30 or bigger. This requires putting intermediate levels. It is somewhat complicated to explain but I will try tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hmm...very interesting.  I'll definitely watch for more this weekend.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
anouther stategy any one make this calculere its totel lot sixe on excel as i did not know about use of excel . as in unnormal situtation price move 10000 points. so calculate the totel lot size according to ur account balance is required. open buylimit sell limit sellstop buy stop on same level and same lot in incresing. means 0.01,0.02,0.03 ...........the totel lot means = 0.01+0.02+..........up to 10000 point. also ur level means grid size =1000 is u did not use vps . when price move a lot of in one direction here u stategy. if ur totel lot can hendel anouther 10000 poits then close profit lot and wait price move back . or put breack even on winning lot.

this will make a prymid. but i can not use the excel so did not know the totel lot according to balance

This one Im trying the Grid+heging concept too .

--- 帖子 #40 ---
hey Kfx, is this first grid correct?

http://gyazo.com/636243bca0f9bb69b6d8f03c0137f383

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes, thats a good start.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I will show you now when the separation between opened grids is 30 pips or more. We will call to this example "Hedge x4 Inside Grid".

1. We have 2 opposite grids opened (3 x1 buys and 3 x2 sells). At this point some x2 sells have been closed already ( 5 sells x 2 = 100 pips )

2. The separation between the grid level 3 of opened buys and lgrid evel 3 of opened sells is 30 pips.

3. The price back up to the middle of the grids separation. In this case the middle would be 15 pips, so we consider the level closest to buys to start with x4 trades.

4. At some point the price reach or x1 buys TP and are closed.( 3 buys x 1 = 30 pips )

5. We still open x4 buys until get our 250 pips or more target.

http://oi61.tinypic.com/2edxmok.jpg

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So if less than 30 pips, just wait for your 2x to close your 1x?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Exactly ...

I see you undestand it.

I will wait if some member have some more questions. If all is clear until now, I will post some more complicated example like "Hedge x16 Inside Grid"

--- 帖子 #45 ---
x16...ouch

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Here is the "Hedge x16 Inside Grid" example. I think the picture speak by itself.

1000 pips or more target for this example, by the way.

http://oi58.tinypic.com/2zqssn9.jpg

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I must be missing something on you x16 example.  Shouldn't the x2's and x4's be opposite one another...buy/sell.

Why are the x2's further in the past than the x1's.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Can you summarize the system in a word document. Hard to pick up a piece here and there.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I think I got it.  Seems like you might have the x1 and x2 labels reversed?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
What's the TP pips on the x8 level? 500?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
So if price had made it to the blue circle we'd be buying at x32?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Haha ... You are right. My mistake. Picture is now fixed.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Exactly ...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
No.

When we have an inside grid opened, we will wait for the outside grid to close, in this case the x8 buys, to open a new x32 grid.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi GoldenEA, welcome to the thread.

All examples and rules are summarized in the first post now.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Kfx,

Thanks in advance for the effort you put on this to explain us the system. The biggest problem is the "language" my friend. I am sure I understood very different than you tried to tell. Here is what I understood and I know I am wrong. So please could you just explain the simple example in more detail and with clear sentences or drawings. I guess your system is strong but please help us to understand what this system is about.

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hi great thread n interesting idea

but i dont understand anything at all...i will try read again & again

appreciate some1 can simplify it

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi Ata-Turkoglu, welcome to the thread. Here is your answer. Hope this help you.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi hewtwok, welcome to the thread.

I know this is complicated first if you have not experienced with advanced grids, and second because my english is very bad.

But feel free to post any questions you have and I'll try to answer.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
That was very helpful Kfx, thanks..

I am happy to see that I am close to understand the system. To understand more I need to ask another question. Here it goes:

Now since you explained that we open a buy trade at Level-1:
When you say "set all TPs at level 1" should we even set the TP of this trade to Level-1?
If yes then it means the first long we opened brings us 0 profit? Right?

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Your welcome.

Yes, al TPs of the 3 trades to Level-1.

That means, first long give us 0 pips, second long 10 pips and third long 20 pips, total = 30 pips.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I know all visitors will make use of your answers to questions so allow me to ask another crucial question:

How do you start your trading day? You open any chart.. no matter what pair.. what timeframe.. and look for the price to touch coming from above or below and proceed without hesitation? Or is there a trick to find out where the optimal Level-1 could be? What you called Level-2 could be Level-3 for another person. What you called Level-3 could be level-1 for some other and the whole story would change.. or???? I am thinking out loud.. how you decide, what are you looking for before you start with your first trade of the day with this system???? (Please keep your answer connected to example 1 only.. the other situations are still too complex to understand so I want to go step by step if you don't mind..)

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Kfx

Will you be addressing MM and lot sizing. Seems like the rational huge drawdown of martingale would be tempered by the many TP's along the way

--- 帖子 #64 ---
No problem.

Currently I'm not using this system. As I said earlier is a Work In Progress (WIP) project and I hope all interested members and myself can improve it.

To trade this system in the future, it would be necessary to crate an EA because it is a full time (24 hours) system. But I think it is better left this for later and focus on the details of the system first.

For backtesting I have used M5 EUR/USD, buy maybe it works better in other pairs.

Yes, no specific rules for entry. No secrets, Just wait to touch a level.

What I talk about level 1,2 or 3, I mean grid levels. So level 1 is the main entry, level 2 the second trade and level 3 the las trade. Grids in this system (for now) have not more than 3 levels.

I'm just looking for price to touch some level from above os bellow to do the first trade ... that's it.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks again, very well explained

Okay, no more questions for the first and simple example for now.. I will go and check this simple version on different pairs and different timeframes.

I will test it on GBP/JPY, the FDAX index and Gold... soon I will let you know about the results after testing this for a while..

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #66 ---
That's a very important thing for us to study.

Keep in mind that this system can easily give us 10.000 pips per month.

My idea is to have a Max. DD of -5.000 in a grids serie, including open and closed positions. At this point we will close all trades. This represents a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% of your account ... Depending on how aggressive trader you are.

Another idea is close all trades in some hedging level, for example close all trades at x32.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks to you and good luck with those pairs.

It would be interesting to create some kind of basket of several pairs, hahaha. More complications

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Kfx,

How do we determine the profit target for each hedge? I mean hedge x2 is 100pips, hedge x4 is 250pips, hedge x8 is 500pips, hedge x16 is 1000pips?

How about hedge x32? 1000pips x2 = 2000 pips?

I'm kinda curious to know what would happen when its hedge x32? will the drawdown wipe out the account like normal martingale strategy?

Anyway, thanks for this strategy, it seems very original to me (i have yet to encounter strategy like this). Subscribed!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hope we're not asking too many questions...must mean there's interest

So let's say you have x1 sells open...price moves up to start x2 buys...price moves down and you start x4 inside sells...price moves back up and hits x2 buy TP, but you still haven't reached your 100 net pips...you have x1s and x4s open, all sells.  Now what?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
If i'm getting this right, let's say the price moves back up to hedge_x8_level 1, we will have closed 3 x8 buy trades. At this price level, we have 3 x4 sell trades and 3 x16 sell trade still opening.

Assuming the x16 trades have not collected gains yet.

The drawdown would be:

x4_level 1= 8 x 4 x 10 pips = 320

x4_level 2= 7 x 4 x 10 pips = 280

x4_level 3= 6 x 4 x 10 pips = 240

x16_level 1= 7 x 16 x 10 pips = 1120

x16_level 2= 6 x 16 x 10 pips = 960

x16_level 3= 5 x 16 x 10 pips = 800

Total drawdown for open trades = 3720 pips

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi wilsonch, welcome to the thread.

I refer you to post #65, where I answered to spyderman.

As I said before, for now it would be fine a 5.000 pips of Max DD, that represents a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% of your account ... Depending on how aggressive trader you are. For example if you start with 0.01 lot, your max DD would be 500$.

I have not gotten to see a x32 hedge level yet (I have not done too extensive backtest), but according to my computations, closing all positions at the x32 hedge level, it could reach a loss of around 3000 pips or so.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Wilson...did you net out against all the profits you took along the way?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Easy.

Once the x2 TP reached, we will wait for the price moves one more level as usual to start with x8 buys.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi spyder, it is my intention not to nett them out, since we are at the stage of paper trade, I would prefer to put myself in a very downside position. It is quite normal in forex that when we open the 3 x16 trade, the price will immediately go against us. So, I think we need to prepare for the worst, from there we can think of a more rational MM.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
As spyderman say, you have to add all profits gained in the way until the x16 or x32 hedge level was opened.

Depends on how many profits you have closed, but yes, you have about 3.000 pips max DD when you go from x16 to x32 if you have not earned too much profit before.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Kfx and spyder, both of you are correct. I have explained myself in post 73 that i exclude them on intention. Hope you guys are cool for me being negative. I have seen enough 'impossibles' in casino. Imagine the roulette having 20-30 plus consecutive RED.

With a good MM, even if we reach x32 or x64, i believe the strategy is good at recovering, especially grinding profits through inside-grids.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
No negative.

I know this system will fail, so I do not like trading grids/martingales until blow Account, thats because we have a equtity loss percent.

It would be great if you explain your MM to reach the x32 or x64 ... Maybe start with a smaller lot? ... please, let us know

--- 帖子 #78 ---
So Kfx...let me recap some permutations in my mind so I have them straight.

If the reaching of a level (let's say from the top side coming down) closes out a series and starts a new one, than we would be placing a new 1x buy at that level.

For an x2 or any subsequent outside grid (like the x8 mentioned above) the entry comes after moving another level from the previous trade.

An inside grid is formed if there is at least 3 levels between the nearest levels of the two outside grids.  Inside grid starts at 1/2 way between outside grids (or next level closer to first outside grid, if 1/2 way is between grids).

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Ufff ... That one is not so easy, maybe can you post some picture as example as I can explain you the right way?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Subscribed as i love grid and martin. I need sometime later to read again your system

Best to explain with charts and thanks for sharing.

Hi Again Kfx,

So like I mentioned before I want to go step by step.. and now I examined your second simple example you called Hedge x2.. you will see my new questions on the drawing.. I want to be sure again if my thinkng process is right.

Many Thanks

Hi Kfx, I am the newest one, who have interest.

I am going to learn it step by step.

In all you SS, you use 5 min TF, right? EU pair?

I want to look at it in my chart for better understanding.

what about the spread different broker with different spread.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
kfx, thanks for sharing. Ive been playing recently in the past few weeks with same strategy but using zz_semafore. Im still confuse about your hedge strategy. Kindly please post your chart with info about your sells and buys.Thanks!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
ok, lets go with a numerical example....

say price dropped from 1.0100 to 1.0090, i buy 1 Lot at 1.0090 with TP 10 pips (TP 1.0100)

price dropped further to 1.0080, buy 1 Lot at 1.0080 with TP 10 pips (TP 1.0090)

price dropped further to 1.0070, buy 1 Lot at 1.0070 with TP 20 pips (TP 1.0090)

so far am i rite?

let say price decided to dropped more to 1.0060, i enter 2 Lot Sell at 1.0060? TP 10 pips?

price dropped further to 1.0050, enter another 2 Lot Sell at 1.0050 with TP10 pips?

No SL set for every entry rite?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi KFX!

Are you sure that the correct way!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Kfx!

Could you please upload few of your charts of entry

&exists so we could understand easly.

I appreciate your time and effort.

Take care

Loveandpeace

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi culik_gpl, welcome to the thread.

Yes, I use 5 min TF in EUR/USD pair

About spread, It is a good question. In my trades, the spread is allways included so for example 10 pips is the net gain. I apply 0.4 pips spread because is the double of the average spread that my broker have.

But, in my case, to all my gains I have to discount all the commisions, so depending on the number of trades I pay more or less.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi mario777 and loveandpeace, welcome to the thread.

You have this pictures in the first post.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Yes, all that you have said is correct.

No SL.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
continuing my above example....

if price further drop 1.0040, sell another 2 Lot at 1.0040 TP10?

the original 3 buy of 1 Lot will forever be floating? No emergency exit of close all at net profit?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Not forever, but until we get our target, in this case 100 net pips or our loss percent.

It would be a rare situation the price go up or down 1.000 or 2.000 pips without give the x2 trades opportunities to get profits with some grids.

But of course you never know, so we have our percent stop, so it can happen.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
This is another example of "Basic entries" when our martingale and hedging are not necessary to use yet, only grids.

I think this time will be quite clear, I do not know how to simplify it more

Hallo KFX.

Thks, that's very clear!

Can you make an example also for x4, x8, x16, x32, please?

And so far, can you explain how we have to proceed from one "x..." step to another (for ex. from x4 to x8)?

Thank you .

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi KFX,

i also want to join your thread to test the system. I have draw some entrys on eur/usd m5 from last friday.

Plz can you comment my entrys if right or wrong?!

I took 6 trades, but iam not sure what´s with "sell 2" ( i think thats a loss) and "buy 2" (i don´t now the exact BE point/time).

I´m only take BE and TP with more then 2 pips above or below the grid levels (spread).

Thanks and greetz

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Not to butt in "but"... I think the only step howtwok missed was bringing his first buy's TP down to 1.0090 when the 2nd buy was taken.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Your TP on sell 3 & 4 and BE on sell 2 would be 1.34200 which hasn't hit yet.  So no buy 2 yet.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Great chart Kfx...very clear

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi mwsteiner, welcome to the thread.

There is not B.E. in this system . You have to wait to 'sell 2', 'sell 3' and 'sell 4' reach the TP @ 1.34200.

Please, take a look at the example picture in post #95, I think would be very helpful for you.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
You are quick my friend

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I do not understand what you mean ... Yo know ... my bad english.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Kfx, Am i missing something? those two green horizontal lines on your recent example, are they not BE?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
ah nice chart...now i see

buy 1st 1 lot with TP 10 pips ---> price move down...

buy 2nd 1 lot with TP10 pips (moved 1st lot TP to 0 ips) ---> price move down...

buy 3rd 1 lot with TP 20 pips

if price manage to climb back up and all hit TP, i go opposite trade i.e. sell 1st 1 lot (the cycle begins again)

TP hit...so i go opposite trade again...i.e buy 1 lot and so on....

am i rite?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I just meant that on hewtwok's example he forgot to move his level 1 buy to BE once the 2nd buy was made.

You're doing fine with your English too...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I meant no grid finish in B.E. , but yes, when you have 2 or 3 trades in a grid, one of them finish in B.E.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Perfectly right!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Ah ok, that's correct.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thanks mate, that helped me a lot!

another question:

In my example i have 3 open sell orders (sell 2, sell 3 and sell 4) which i´m waiting for TP @ 1.34200, then "buy 2" at this line (1.34200)?

When price go up again then i would 2lot "sell 5"?

Thanks a lot and excuse my bad English!

greetz Michael

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Yes, buy 2 in 1.34200

If the price goes to 1.3450 without close the 3 sells, you have to buy 2 lots.

If you buy 2 get TP, you sell 1 lot.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Kfx,

Was busy all day and had to drive long distance too.. so couldnt reply till now..

Thank you so much for your explanations on my Hedge x2 question. It was so helpful again.

Many Thanks..

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Thanks a lot KFX!!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi Kfx... you know what? Just like Neo was saying in the Matrix movie: "I know kung-fu...."  same way I know now your system.. finally I got it.. Understanding the base method and hedge x2 opened the doors of understanding hedge x4 and x8 and x16 and all connected because now I can clearly see that these are all the methods we had to use if things go in the opposite way.

Because at the very beginning I was assuming the examples you are axplaining are all separate but they were not. They are just a response to the market if price goes against you. So I am 100% sure now what this system is trying to do. All I need is to get used to the rules.

Many thanks mate.. I will go back to my tests now by using the system fully..

Important Note: In the real world we have "spread" and "commissions" and therefore we have to earn a little more pips than you were calculating. Of course for everyone of us it depends on broker we use, the pair or instruments we trade.. so I keep that in mind too..

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #118 ---
A picture is better than thousand words! Thanks alot...now i understand your basic level 1 grid now...waitin for more....

Btw the way 10 pips grid is an example only? Can we use 15 or 20 pips grid depends on pair ???

Thanks

--- 帖子 #119 ---
been reading all the pages. i hope i understand everything, i will test it out on demo on Eur/Usd for this week and give feedback on the test

anyway, i use this sweetspot indi as guidance because it draw 10 pips grid

--- 帖子 #120 ---
just curious...say i entered my

buy 1st lot x1, price down

buy 2nd lot x1, price down

buy 3rd lot x1, price down

at what stage shall i enter the Sell lot x2?

or should i wait until the above 3 buy trade to reach ?? % drawdown i emergency close all trade at loss target which i set?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
correct me if i'm wrong. u start only sell x2 lot when the price reach lvl 4 (10 pip below your 3rd buy) this is hedge x2. untill u reached 100 pips, then u close all.

if, let say the price go down, but didn't reach your tp (your sell x2) and go back up, and all your 3 buy x1 order hit tp, u wait for another level above your buy x1 TP and start buy x4 and stop when 250 pip gain. this is hedge x4

this hedge x2 and hedge x4 and so on only happen if the market does not agree with the basic entries of MGH system.

i hope i got this right

--- 帖子 #122 ---
No problem guys.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I'm glad you understand. You are right, all are parts of the same system and is very important to keep in mind spread and commissions when we calculating the net profit.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Yes, 10 pips grid in EUR/USD is only an example, you can try to use another grid size or pair.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Nice one catextract89. I use this.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
You should enter your first sell x2, 10 pips bellow from your 3rd buy.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Correct

That's correct too.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Kfx,

So far, after doing my homework and studying your system I have one more question to ask.

In the drawing regarding to the rules you listed in your first post, you are starting with a "buy" when price comes down. You don't open any sell before all earlier longs are closed. Or if price falls even more you start the "only short hedge x2" series. I look at the other examples and still they all start with a "buy trade" when price comes from above.

So my question is: Do we always have to start with a buy? Could we also start with a sell when price comes from below and then reversing the rules? That means we will start our first trade, now price comes from below. Here we open a "sell trade" first, additionally we apply same rules in a reversed way.

Is this allowed? Logically it should work though, but I wish to know your opinion.

I asked this question because it is closely connected with this question:
-Would it not more better to think first how to start the first trade of the day? With a first buy or with a first sell? By considering if the market is going sideways, up or down? Because subconsciously I feel like if we start going against the trend we already push ourselves into the hedge x2, x4 etc. situations, right? Just thinking out loud.

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #129 ---
i think MGH is more into how to manage your trade if your system fail you.

let say, i trade using system A. I see a buy opportunity, i open buy trade, and the price goes against me. this is the time where MGH system will be applied.

nevertheless, like you said, we need some sort of rule to trigger either to start with buy or sell.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Kfx and all, Im trying to understand this system kindly please comment if my chart is correct. And my question is,are the last 3 buys (2x) correct? what is to do next after all my last 3 sells taken profit? do I buy? or sell? Many Thanks!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
hmm i can't help but to think about this...hedge x2.

how many levels will be hedge x2?

as price drops further down, i create more hedge x2 up to 3 levels too?

or just 1 level of hedge x2?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
so far your picture is correct. what happen next is, after the 3 sell x1 tp, u wait for the price to reach level 4 below your first sell x1. and then we start with hedge x4. if not, stay with hedge x2 and close all position when u reach 100 pips.

i think that's about right. sorry if i'm wrong, i'm trying to fully understand it too

--- 帖子 #133 ---
yes, just like the basic entries. 3 level of hedge x2 until u reached the profit target. if, your hedge x2 failed you, then it's time for hedge x4, then hedge x4 inside and so on.

this hedge x4 inside is confusing for me to. will study it further during my live test this week

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Catextract89,

Yes I look at it the same way you mentioned. The systems acts like a rescue mission once you realize your trades get trapped inside a wrong turn. The more I understand the logic the more I want to participate on developing the best version out of it. But first things first, learning the basics should be the only goal for now. But yes I started making thoughts about finding a trigger rule for all kind of buy or sell scenarios.

Appreciate your ideas and cooperation.

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Just keep taking those x2 TPs until you get to 100 net pips profit, then close the whole bunch.  Unless, like CAT mentions, the price moves back up and you have to start your inside x4

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I have a small account I'm going to throw this on...(I hate demos)

I'm using the EurUsd but trying with a 50 pip grid (backtested fairly well) so I won't have to watch it 24/7.

Got my pending orders set...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #137 ---
if someone can summarize this system, maybe we can write an EA for it.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Yes, no problem with that. You can start selling if price comes from above if you want, or you can use some signal or indicator.

But I prefer to make many entries constantly with a simple criterion, to earn many pips to support a large Drawdown.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
50 pip eh? this look interesting. with 10 pip apart, i'm constantly watching the price movement. maybe i should give this a try. i also doing this on a small cent account with 10USD for this test. will give back the result once this week is finish.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Yes, but keep in mind that with very complicated entry rules, you can not earn enought pips to support a large drawdown.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
catextract89 has already answered you well.

Thanks catextract89.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Nice spyderman, I hope you are not risking too much money, as this is a WIP.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
spyderman has already answered you well.

Thanks spyderman.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Maybe omeone with good english can re-write all the rules correctly.

Thanks for your interest.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
By the way spyderman, we could also use dynamic grids depending on the ATR value. What you think?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Makes sense to adjust the grid to some factor of ATR, if for no other reason then to facilitate manual trading...can't very well monitor GbpJpy with a 10 pip grid.

Now if you get an EA going, then you can optimize to find the best "historic" setting for that pair.

As an example, I backtested 1 pair (think it was EurChf) this weekend using various grid sizes.  1 size produced about 350 pips for April.  Another size was 150.  Another was about 50 but with an open drawdown at end of month.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
is this ea works, any one comment it, suppose u thinks in a pair in over brought or over sold condition or r2,r3,s2,s3 support and resistance   condition . u open a big order if that order fail u will ruin or big loss. u open it like 5 buy or 5 sell. i assume u open 5 buy lot. but price goes down  so u r in loss. .......

then u use an ea which having these quality.

1. it open pending order 20 pending sell stop order blow ur 5 lot buy order. it will never open sell order above ur buy order.always blow ur buy order having grid size 100 (suppose).

2. each pending sell stop order having 0.5 sell lot stop loss 100 breackeven 100 grid size 100 .

3. it reopen close sell order having distance 100 both sell limit and sell stop but blow ur 5  lot buy.

4. it will update its order every 1 minute .

5. every grid level there is a only one sell order open or pending.

that is whole process is for ur 5 buy lot ; at last price goes in buy diection and u will win.

comment it can this ea or system win. i m asking u can this win not asking u make ea.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
hi gridmaster,

I have a hard time trying to understand what you are saying. can you elaborate more? maybe with a picture to illustrate further.

thanks a bunch

--- 帖子 #149 ---
i notice this as well. don't know how will ATR value will affect the system. cause like spyderman said, there is no point in 10 pip grid in GbpJpy. different pip grid yield different result for different pair. that apart, i will stick with 10 pip grid in EurUsd for this whole week. let see how it goes

this is my grid currently

--- 帖子 #150 ---
You are right, I thinks is time to start to programing an EA to backtest several pairs properly

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Nice chart, good luck

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Dear friends, I want to suggest you this upgrades:

1) consider only exchanges that has an ADR (average daily range, period 10 or 20) that is >=60 pips

2) consider the 50% fibo line; if grid lines are above 50% line than we consider only sell signal, if are below we consider only buy signal

I mean, the 50% fibo line is somewhere an attractor for the dinamic of daily price, so it's better to consider it.

See the picture of today GBPNZD

Hi Kfx,

Yet another question:

We opened our first long trade and then price goes against us so we open a second long trade..... now..... if price goes higher and hits TP's of these 2 long trades. Are we allowed to open a short trade here? Or do we have to wait till 3 longs close at one strike?

Asking same question in other words:

If price comes back to level-1 and closes our 1 long trade, or 2 long trades or 3 long trades in one strike at which case we are opening the first short?

I hope my question is clear enough.

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Short S1, S2, S3 close at tp at arrow1, because grid is above 50% fibo (dotted white line);

then open a long L1, cause grid is below 50%;

then close L1 and open S1 (sorry....my mistake) at arrow2 and then S4; both closed at tp at arrow 3; no open a buy!!!!

then open a buy L2 (below 50%fibo) that goes at tp (arrow4); here open a sell S5;

then S6, then S7....tp at arrow 5;

then S8  tp at arrow6.

All trades at TP!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi xlcharly, welcome to the thread.

I like your idea. Do you draw the previous or current fibo?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Yes, when our 1 long trade or 2 long trades or 3 long trades hit the TP, we open a new x1 sell.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hmmm...interesting.  Did you cherry pick that pair or just take one at random.

If you're really confident in the attraction, why close the sells at arrow 3, ride them to L2.  Of course that skews the whole strategy.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi spiderman....current fibo, to compare where grid's levels are positioned.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
GBPNZD for its great ADR (use indicator attached...set 10 days).

S1 (S1 bis...my mistake) and S4....isn't TP at arrow 3? I'm wrong?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
sorry....the indi....

--- 帖子 #161 ---
actual situation....

how to read the picture:

actual range: ADR  (% actual/ADR)  -  spread - pip's value in $

http://i59.tinypic.com/261onzr.jpg
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yeah, normal TP would be at arrow 3.  I was just commenting that if you change the strategy by not taking a buy at that point and wait until price gets to next level down, you might as well carry those 2 sells on down with you for some extra pips

--- 帖子 #163 ---
mmmmmm....why not? A good idea!

Anyway we can close S1(bis) and S4 at 50% fibo (our polar star) and then waiting for the next signal (up or down 50% fibo).

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Charly,

Do you have the indi for the running Fib

--- 帖子 #165 ---
xlcharly,

good job, this is the kind of trigger that maybe suitable for the MGH system. maybe if u can attached the indicator, that will be great

Looks good, very promising. If anyone can write an EA do this strategy, would be appreciated.

Hi Kfx,

I have a different question now.. but it may happen and I need to know what you would suggest if something like this happens.

My question is on the drawing. I hope my simple drawing is clear enough so you can get the idea.

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Good question ATA, will be interesting to see Kfx's response.

My thoughts are that you could have your pending orders in place (both x1's and x2's) that would help with some of that.

Also that is one advantage of a bigger grid size. It will neutralize much of the spike issues.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks mate.. yeah.. I am looking forward for Kfx's answer.. but you are right a bigger grid size would definitely eliminate my concern.. but I know from research that sometimes markets can have even 60 pips or higher spikes in a minute.. still need to know what the strategy would be..

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Nice, let see what happen.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Typical case when we are near/in high impact news.

I think the solutions can be:

1) if grid is in gain, close the grid 30 minutes before news

2) if grid is in loss, hedging the opened positions. I mean, suppose I have 3x1 buy opened, I open a 3lots sell to hedge my grid, like to freeze the situation. So, if a gap happens, I'm protected by the hedging  sell lots.

IMHO

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Very good idea.. I am a hedger already.. never close trades.. always open hedges instead as long as my equity allows.. so your solution is in my list now.. but still would like to know what Kfx will add to it..

Thanks for sharing your cooperative opinion

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Yes, news or quick moves are a big problem. You can have all your pending orders and TP's ready to be hit, but in the real live the slippage may cause great damage.

A solution that we can apply, is to have only 3 pending orders but without TP. If we see that price is strong trending, wait for all our positions get BE or some profit and close all.

I have to say that when I was creating this system, I did not close the trades 1 on 1, but 3 on 3. Thus, we always win ground to opposite positions, but otherwise does not accumulate profit little by little.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
say we have 3 sell with 1x lot and at  level 4 we opened 2x buy,1. what tp should i have for this buy? 2. price continue to go up to 5 level, 6 level, do i add 2x buy at 5 and 6 level and what tp should set for 2x buy?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
1.- 10 pips

2.- Yes, you add 2x buy in 5,6,7,8, etc .... levels with 10 pips TP each.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks Kfx...

Although I didn't get the meaning of your sentence: "I did not close the trades 1 on 1, but 3 on 3", I will try to figure it out once I find time to revisit your example charts.

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I mean I was thinking of doing this at the beginning of creating the system, but I do not use this currently.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Oh.. okay now I understand.. I was thinking of something else.. clear now..

Many Thanks and Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi, I think the use of the 50% fibo rule could apply when pair is in a range, but when the pair go big in one direction that rule will prevent you from using the x2 Hedge strategy to recover from the x1's in loss because you could not Buy/Sell x2 because price will be very far from the 50% fibo level.

Do you agree?

BTW very nice strategy.. following with interest, thanks Kfx

--- 帖子 #183 ---
should we do something like this?

if we have 3 1x sell and 3 2x buy, three options we can do.

1. if market move up enough, we close all orders with profit.

2. if market move down enough, 3 1x sell tp. all sell orders closed. then we open 4x sell orders only. wait for market down enough to close all in profit.

3. if market not moved, just watch the paint dry.

this way, we only have two grid, sell and buy. always set tp for small lot orders.

any comments?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Masilva,

I don't think charly was suggesting to use the Fib on every order, just for the start of a series.  In other words after you hit the overall TP and there are no more trades open, then use the fib to decide which way to go.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
That's basically what we're doing Golden.  Only difference is that if there is a large spacing between the outside grids we are employing the inside grids to get the series closed.  Otherwise we could be stuck in a range bound limbo for excessive amount of time.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
tell me why we would get spacing more than 30 pips? give me an example please.

--- 帖子 #187 ---

I think GoldenEA talk about open x4 trades without TP until get some target. Thats the same I said before, but I only open max 3 trades. Those 3 trades can be so the price goes against, as if going in your favor.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
masilva and kaczucha11, welcome to the thread.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
i am talking about both sell and buy max open traders is 3 as well. total are 6 trades. in such case, either close all trade on target, or tp small lot trades.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
You mean between x1's & x2's, or between x2's and x4's?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yea....perfect!

It's only one way to choice the direction to initially open the grid.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
it can only be between x1 & x2, or x2 & x4, you don't have more than two grids at the same time.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Sorry, I guess I'm not following.  You have your x1 buys open and a set of x2 sells...6 total.  Now if price went way up as in this sampling you get a large space that we use x4's on.  In this case, we got the TP at the top of the x2's but if we hadn't and price would have fallen then we would have started x4

So rather than start the inside x4's, what are you suggesting?

Thx

--- 帖子 #196 ---
in this case, x1 buy is tp and x4 buy were opened, price continued up closed all 6 orders. we start again. where is the larger gap?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
In my pic, each series is contained between red vertical lines.  After the 1st vertical we started a new series with x1 sells.  Price continued up for quite a ways as we kept adding and closing x2 buys.  What I'm saying is that if price had reversed after first touching 1.23400 and fallen down we would have had a gap of 150 pips.  If price kept falling we would have our x4's

--- 帖子 #198 ---
we are not talking about the same thing. i would not  keep adding and closing x2 buy without closing x1 sell.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Okay, so now that we're at least looking at the same picture, what would you do instead of the x2 buys

--- 帖子 #200 ---
are you following me? see post 197.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
What x1 and x4 buys are you referring to.  On the pic, the x1 are sells...I'm really lost

--- 帖子 #202 ---
read my post at 184. you won't be lost.

now i am looking for worst case for this approach. any comments?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
From your initial comment I thought you were presenting a different approach with items 1-3, but perhaps you were just summarizing. If so, my mistake.

That's why in my initial response to you I mentioned "we were already doing that".

So, am I right in understanding that the change you had in mind is just point 3. Not to open the inside grids?

Whew!!! I thought I was losing my mind.

Now...to comment...cutting down on orders would be a great thing in itself. Keep us away from margin.

Referring back to my pic on the E/F pair. I've copied it again but zoomed out.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

At the very top where it says 60 pips, that is where I finally got my net 100 pips to close the series. Just a few pips short of that and price would have fallen. So without the inside grids you'd be waiting for one of the outsides to hit TP. In this case it was a few weeks later when price moved on up.

So I guess it becomes a question of waiting out the range bound periods.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
No problem, the purpose of this thread is to learn and improve the system, so keep with your good work guys.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
tell me what is your trades opened process from left to top (60pips)?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
This is a pretty involved process you've come up with here Kfx...Kudos

It's going to be hard to quantify (at least for me) the risk involved.  With most Martingales it's fairly easy to figure out when and where you might (or might have on backtest) hit the "Death" trade and wipe out your account.  But with this, we're banking so many TP's along the way, it's giving a lot of relief to our margin level.

T'will be interesting.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Starting with that first red vertical line (that's the start of a new series), I have 3 sells (sells are in red, buys in blues).  Obviously price moved higher so no TP and at level 4 or 1.2180 I started my x2 buys.  They moved up pretty steadily banking TP's along the way.  Of course the sells were getting deeper in the hold.  At the top, when hitting that last 60 pip TP, I was able to net all the TP's against the floating loss from the sells of 540 pips to get my + 100 and close the series.

Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
man, once you start x2 buy i would not close or tp buy trades until i close all trades in profit. you follow me?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
That would be awesome in hindsight, but what do you do with all those x2 buys if price turns back down. How far do you let those winners turn to losers before closing?

It might work, but you know, Murphy's law.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Look on the bright side Golden.

During our discussion your trade explorer has gone for a 50% return to 53%...you are welcome.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
wait for price retrace to tp all x1 sell then open x4 sell. i think this is the worst case price stuck in the range

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I'd be afraid you'd hit some serious drawdown if price starts ranging after starting the x4's.  Would be interesting to see on a chart though...hint...hint

--- 帖子 #216 ---
looking at the strategy, it feels a bit similar to this doesn't it? except for the 3 levels thingy (refer pdf)

if market stuck in range within our 3 buy and 3 sell levels, we will end up in big drawdown, am i rite?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hy guys.....today very interesting scenario on GBPNZD (biggest ADR)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

as you can see, respecting the fibo filter, I open only sell above 50% fibo and buy below.

So 1,2,3 sell and tp at arrow 1.

Then sell again at 4 and tp at arrow 2.

Then buy at 5 and......?????.....4 big news from England!!!!!!

Perhaps was better don't open long at point 5 (1.99600)?...I think so....but.....

suppose that long at 5 was opened.

Price fall down....must we open a sell x2 at 1.99400? Then (TP sell at 1.99300, point 7) open after a new buy at point 8 respecting the strategy?

What do you think about it?

p.s. vertical red dotted line, is the Frankfurt open. I use this strategy only from 8.00 GMT+2 (summer hour), GMT+1 (winterly).

My mt4 is actually GMT+3, so I put the line at 9.00.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
The problem with the PDF system is that you get very litte profit Vs. high DD.

In my system you can get big DD (depending on your risk %) and bid profit (depending on your risk % too)

I do not like grids that risk all our account, you should always have a maximum level of risk to know where close all positions. This should be studied in each pair independently.

Besides that both systems also have many differences as you can see. For example in my sytstem I leave a grid level space to prevent the price bounce in the same S/R again and again.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi boss ...

what do you think about the dangerous situation in the picture?

Is it ok for you to open sell 2 at 1.99400 and then a x1 buy at 8?

Updating.....

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Let'see the importance of 50% fibo. At this level we can close both x1 buy (point 5 and 8) as pointed out with the arrow.

p.s. sorry for my english!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
anyway....respecting the strategy, we would have at this moment 3 x1 buy opened, as you can see at point 5,8,9 an a probable x2 sell if price reaches 1.99200.

Let's see......

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #221 ---
What about the x1 buy @ 1.99500?

Then @ 1.99300 you have to sell x2. At 1.99200 another x2 sell, and when the price go up another x2 sell @ 1.99400 ...

Price go up and all your x1 buys have rached the TP.

Now you have to wait ... If price go to 1.99700 you open x4 buy ... if go down, you get TP for your x2 sells.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hello,

Thanks KFX and other who understand to your effort

I try to understand this system but im not so familar with hedging and when doubling lots size.

I take an arbitrary entry on yesturday london open.

i want to know if i've doubled lot size correctly or not.

(like other English is not my mother language  )

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi ckikadikoi, welcome to the thread.

You are doing right ...

But, you should continue selling x2 until get 100 pips profit. You only start with x4 if the price go up and you start with buys in a inside grid.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
So if we look at the blue vertical line it s not a new grid ??

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Woke up this morning to my second entry on the EurUsd 50pip grid.  Gotta love that Eur movement during London open.

Anyways...moved my TP on trade 1 to BE at 1.3400 with same TP on trade 2

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Charly,

Was just making adjustments to my pending orders (as I drink my first cup of coffee ) and realized a possible snag using the 50% fib.

You will have to wait until you hit TP on a series before you determine which direction your next trade will be, whereas, with Kfx's method that is predetermined so that

you can set all your pendings (for overnight) and not miss out on your trades.  What do you think.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yes, but we only double the lot at oppossite operation type. For example from sells to buys or from buys to sells

--- 帖子 #228 ---
EUR/USD is very trending down now, but I expect some reversal in the short time.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Agreed...that's why I like your system.  Don't have to stress too much about direction, just let the grid hedge do the work.

Now when we get to some serious open orders, we'll see if that's still the case.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
ok thanks for your aswer

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi Kfx,

So far I tested myself on a 5 minute chart DAX trade. The steps I followed are documented in the image.

I would really appreciate if you could check these steps and tell me if any of my steps are wrong. I also have a question for step 32.. There it became tricky for me.. So could you help me out of my little concern?

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #232 ---
ATA...not sure when Kfx will return, but meanwhile I may comment.  Then Kfx can when he's back.

Just starting out.  No short on #2.  The long #1 didn't hit TP so no shorts.  You would take the 2nd long where you have #3 and closed both at #4, then gone short.

I'll keep checking.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Ata...as I continued on I noticed you doing the same thing. No long at #5 as your #4 was still open.

Just remember you don't take that opposite direction trade unless you hit your TP's

If you could rework your chart based on that...or you can wait for Kfx to comment

--- 帖子 #234 ---
The closing of #1 is at point 6.. don't get confused please.. but you continue and finish first.. I am following

Great thread Kfx

I've been trying to figure this out but have got a little confused when we get past the second series of 2x buys/sells, could you Kfx or spyderman post a chart with each move similar to your second chart (on first page) which is easy to understand when we get to the 4x levels and beyond,

thanks in advance

Eamonn.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
No no.. look closer: Trade #1 didnt close when price arrives at step #3.... so I open another long.. at step #4 both longs are closed.. price goes a little bit down under grid line and comes back and then I opened #5 long that I close at step #6

Okay???

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #238 ---
But you should not have opened the short at #2.  IF trade #1 had immediately gone up to TP at 9180, then you would have taken your short.

So now every entry is skewed.

What should have happened is the first long at 9170, 2nd long at 9160.  Close both at 9170 and go short.  Then short again at 9180.  Both close at 9170.  Then long from there.

When I get a chance I'll take the fdax and run through that time frame in more detail.  When was that screenshot from?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Yes bro.. agree.. I hesitated actually when opening the first short.. so I could open it if my first long would hit TP huh? That's good.. now I know.. the FDAX chart is the latest chart actually.. you can see the pattern if you open a 5min. chart full screen. I started on August 5 with candle 19:05 (GMT +3). But please no need to go so detailed after each step. Many thanks for your concern. Just want to know roughly what I do wrong. Tell me and I can easily follow.

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Well done Spyderman,

Your reminder for the "open a short only after earlier long(s) is(are) closed" rule has saved my day. Thanks a lot!

Now my question for step 32 remains.

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Assuming for the moment that trades 29-31 were correct then you would have started your x4's at the 9100 mark.  You would have hit 3 winners in a row on that.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I think the problem is that we must operate in high volatility period. That's why it's better to avoid long period of eventual loss, for a psychological reason.

So I preferr to open a grid with some starting logic.

If possible, I preferr to avoid long x1, x2, x4....seqeunces.

50% fib help me to open somehow a "directional grid". In an hypotetic EA, sounds good a starting hour too.

Volatility arises from 7.00 GMT (open Frankfurt) to 8.00 GMT (open London and all european markets).

So adding the choice of direction and the high volatilty period, we must see our grid that goes fastly to TP (without x2, x4....).

In my honest opinon!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Uffff ..... tooo much ... I'll try to answer you ....

1. - About the series before Hedge x2 .... For example, why do you open a sell at (2)? .... When you are trading with x1 trades, you never open opossite trades at the same time.

2. When you start the x2 Hedge, you have to open a sell every time the last sell or sells hit the TP.

3. If you don't get your 100 pips profit at (26) or before, you have to open the x4 Hedge @9120 ... Then, the x8 @9060.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi Eamonn, welcome to the thread.

I'll try to post some chart later.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Ooops.  My bad.  I had said 9100.  I forgot about the "1/2 way between grids rule".  Sorry about the confusion.  Thanks Kfx

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thats nice to know, but assuming all trades are correct, I really would like to know what you would do on step 32? Would you open a 4x long?

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #247 ---
OK Kfx.. many many thanks.. I have my answers except that "32 issue"

Assume the 9120 level is not where it is and it was at 9130.. so would you open a 4x trade with that tiny little price peak?

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #248 ---
hi all,

i just try with 50 pips grit on 15M tf here is the result if the price going down to level 4 and pull back to level 3 close the trade

the result in positive profit, need your advise sir Kfx,

cheers

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Of course yes .... Now when it has happened you see that is a little peak, but before forming this candle, do you have a crystal ball to see if that will be a little peak or a big up trend??

--- 帖子 #250 ---
hi Kfx, i am confused.

is that means you can only have 1 x2 sell at any time?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
No, it means you open x2 sell every time you close 1 or a group of 2 or 3, until get you 100 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
The answer couldn't be clearer.. thank you very much.. you hit the nail brother

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Need another confirtation for lot multiplier

is the x4 lots correct or not ...

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Kfx

I'm also developing grid strategies for a while, and its inspiring to see an other perspective on the subject. Its an interesting variation. Until now I only used one hedge position, if the price happens to leave the range I put the grid on, but the possibility of a multi-hedge was always in my mind.

The problem is always the fragile nature of grids, and that the loss with a diluted position rises exponentially. I think I get what you came up with, but honestly I still don't see what happens when the 2x buys that should hedge the 1x sells get in trouble. I didn't read all the comments, but most pictures you posted, the price went in favor of the bigger positon so you could close in profit. But what if its not? You'll start opening 3x sells?

The other thing is everyone seems to start and test it manually, which doesn't make much sense. If you don't have it yet, I can make an EA with the given rules, just can't promise I could understand everything correctly for the first time.

Cheers,

Delfin

Hi All,

I tried to prepare a road map for coding purpose and also to make the learning process of MGH theory easier.

It still is not finished (consists only from step 1x) and also needs to be checked if I did any mistakes.

(Actually I wanted to trigger something in minds of those who are able to write EA code for MT4.)

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I can write ea. but i still don't get the whole picture. if you can layout all system rules, ea is easy.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
for example, if you have 3 1x buy and 3 x2 sell, and market turn around took out 3 1x buy in profit. my question is how to open x4 buy?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
It would depend what happened between the x1's and x2's.  If there wasn't room for an inside grid then you would start your x4 buys one level above the x1 TP.

Continue taking those x4's up until you have a net 100 pip profit (net of all the profits taken less the running drawdown from the x2 sells)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Nice flow chart ATA.  I think you're on the right track.

I'm not quite sure why A goes to C.  Looked through left side and looks good except for after your 3rd long.  Price only needs to fall 10 pips then start the x2.

The 30 pip rule applies to the inside grids  (Again my take, subject to Kfx's review)

--- 帖子 #263 ---
so you tp x4 along the way like add x4 , then tp, adding x4, tp untill 100pips?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Yeppers...or until price tuns again

--- 帖子 #265 ---
if you have 3 x2 sell and price go straight up, how can you achieve 100pip in profit overall with 3 x2 drag your leg?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Every 10 pips up your losing 30 to your sells but gaining 40 with your x4's

--- 帖子 #267 ---
no,

you have 3 x2 sell every 10 pips up you lose 60 pips in sell., but only gain 40 pips.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Nope your losing 60...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
so net gain is -20pip, how can you achieve 100pips?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Oh yes I see now.  You lose a little ground on the straight x4 ups.  So price just shooting straight up hurts you.  You gain ground when you get a few x4's at the same level.

Notice those first 2 x4's.  They ended up being at the same level. So you made 80 pips at that level.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
GoldenEA, I have seen you asked for the worst scenario of this system. Please refer to post 71 for the same discussion too. Although I think a good MM can save us, but I have yet to know what is a good MM. And so far I have yet to see discussion on this worst scenario.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hey wilson,

Actually, I think both Kfx and I commented on that scenario about factoring in all your TP's along the way.  It's hard to address what might or what might not have happened in a hypothetical situation.

If, on the other hand, someone posted a screen shot of a chart that they thought might represent a very negative or worst case scenario, then we could run that through and see where we stand.

Short of that, I agree with you, it's going to be very hard to determine what the potential DD could be on this.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
The main thing I find appealing about Kfx's strategy over other grid/martingale's is that it addresses a variety of market conditions, trending, ranging, etc.

So hopefully we won't get stuck out in the cold.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I agree with you on that. The strategy is quite different to the other martingales and shows the ability to tackle different conditions. Just hope we have solution for the scenario I have mentioned. Best of luck to all

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I really have no clue yet what kind of MM to throw at this.  I'm just going to start small and see what kind of position sizes I end up with.

Kfx - Have you traded this much, or is it more of a new method for you as well?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thanks for the image, i think u got the first part right...waiting for x2 hedge part

Hi Spyderman,

Yes the A and C part was confusing so I fixed that, and I also fixed the issue where we start x2. Thanks mate!

Hi Dashisiong,

Yes I almost got it right and now I fixed it with the kind help of Spyderman. I needed to be at least 90% sure before I prepared the 1x part. Now the rest is actually not so difficult anymore but it needs more space compared to this image. So I will try to create it on one big page. Will let you all know soon.

Hi Kfx and Spyderman,

Now before I continue with the next levels here a question where I need the answer for.

(I changed one of Kfx's example images so it fits my question)

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Ata,

You do take the other to x2 longs, leaving you 3 open.  Once the x1's TP they are gone, so then you start the x4's one level before that x1 TP.  It's not an x4 inside grid because the x1's are gone, so now it's an x4 outside.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Ata!!

I know this question is not addressed to me but I let myself to tell my opinion

I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Kacz,

I think you got the idea.  Just wait 1 more level down before starting that x4

--- 帖子 #282 ---
ohh ok sorre I am continuously learning

--- 帖子 #283 ---
ATA - good work. I think you got it. We'll know for sure when the "Maestro" comes by.

I'd only change 1 thing, not because it's wrong, but just for clarity.

For the first line you might put something like..."Did price just touch a level ------> from above--------> from below---------> no-------> Wait till a touch happens

! !

Start from A Start from B

No big, just my thought

EDIT: I couldn't get the arrows to line up going down, but you get the idea...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Very good.. its nice to see that my questions bring other's wrongs to surface so we all can learn and fix our mistakes..

Thanks spyderman.. so your opinion is "to open longs even in that scenario".. before I can build up I must hear Kfx's comment though..

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hmmm.. what happens if it touches from below??? Can we start the series with shorts??? I didnt read that in original rules. Kfx always starts with a long trade. So there is no option like "if it touches from below" because we do nothing there. Right????

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I'm sure that's just his example.  All the rules just flipped.  When you start a new pair, you have to start somewhere.  After the initial start it won't matter on subsequent series.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Ok.. then we have to mirror the whole story close to what you said for 1x.. but gosh all other variations will give a headache then.. will try my best though :nerd:

From tomorrow until Tuesday I can not connect to the forum but today I will have 4 or 5 free hours, so if you finish "Hedge x2" chart today, I check it quickly.

Thank you again.

Okeedokee Kfx.. will do the best I can as quick as possible..

I m preparing some chart with a "Hedge x32 inside grid" with a big DD.

This may discourage us a bit, because every time we need to add new levels, our drawdown increases and we have to lower the risk, with the consequent drop of profit, especially if we work with small account.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Attached is a simple EA I wrote. The initial entry rule i use is Daily close. if daily close is higher EA opens buy else opens sell. inside grid is not implemented yet.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Wow.. dude.. you are quick  well done...

And here is the Hedge x2 Road Map together with earlier 1x map (so newcomers can see them together)... Hedge x2 could contain errors.. so I will renew image if our masters detect mistakes.. no worries

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks for your EA.

Can you post the mq4 file so other users can review the code or improve it?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
done

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Thanks Ata.

1.- From A2 would be shorts, not longs, because we come from A (buys) .... Same thing for B2.

2.- The 100 pips profit would be the sum of x2 trades minus x1 trades.

3. "If 2x trades profit sum not 100 pips continue from A2" in thi sentence you have to write B2, in the B2 section.

I think thats all.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks.

I know just a little bit of coding so maybe a I can check ie a little bit.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Ooops.. yep I noticed your corrections now.. image fixed..

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #306 ---
The only thing I noticed on the 2nd sheet was that the move to A4 or B4 is conditional on the distance between the x1 & x2 outside grids.  If less than 30 pips then you just have to wait it out.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Only to say thank you to Kfx (the boss), Spider, Ata, Golden, etc.

Very very very good work!

Great guys!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Great job ATA...

As Kfx mentioned in his point 2 should be sum of x2 trades minus x1 trades.  It still says +.  It might be even clearer to say ..."sum of x2 trades - floating loss from x1 trades"

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Yes, that's correct, should be an option for the transition to an x4 inside grid from x2, if the distance >=30 between x1 and x2, and another option to standard x4 grid as you have.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yes I was thinking about that but left it because I really had no idea about it then.. so what you are saying is we should start to check for a condition at that point like this:

functionCheckDistance()

{
When difference of (1x open trades TP price) AND (2x open trades TP price) >= 30{Only then we go to A4 or B4 right?????????}else{We do nothing and wait right?}}

Is that what you meant?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Great work.

Many Thanks, Golden and Ata...

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Except its not the distance between the TP's.  It's the difference between the 3rd x1 position and the 3rd x2 position.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
And then if that distance is 30 or greater you have to calculate where you start the x4.  Kfx stipulates 1/2 the distance and then the next level closest to the x1 trades.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
If (difference of (Entry Price of Last Opened x1 Trade) AND (Entry Price of Last Opened x2 Trade) >= 30{CalculateX4StartingPoint();}
So now.. how we are calculating x4 starting point? We take the half its 15.. but we cannot open on 15 grids. If distance is 40 we can take middle point 20 .. can someone explain please.. here I hesitate again...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
If the 1/2 way point doesn't hit on a grid then we start the inside grid at the next level (after 1/2 way point) closer to the first outside grid...in this case the x1's

See Kfx's post #43

--- 帖子 #316 ---
This is the "Hedge x32 inside grid" .... 5.000+ pips DD.

Maybe it would be a good idea to start with the next level 10 pips away fom inside grid get TP, and not wait for a side level to get TP.

Hello GoldenEa an everyone

i wonder if OrderSendReliable.mq4 is not an MQH file ?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
doesn't matter. just put it in the include folder.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
You mean at 1.3190...

But then if price takes off north again, you got those x2's open.  And then it reverses again and you have x2's, x16's, x32s & x64s

--- 帖子 #320 ---
ok thanks

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Of course at that point you're pretty range bound so even though you have some large lot multiplier's you don't have much pip distance.  And the x2's & 32's will play off the x16s and x64s

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hahahahh.. lmfao

--- 帖子 #323 ---
If my figures are right (and I did them fast so probably not), if you did start the x32's at 1.3190 and it reversed to just shy of your x16's TP you'd be down about 3510 pips at that point.

If price didn't reverse and kept going as it did, you'd be out of the trade at about the 1.3060 level instead of the 1.3020 level

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I am lost

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Yes 1.3190

Where to stop ... x16, x32, 64?, that is the question

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Lol...

Your second x1's are x2's...your first x2's are x4's.  The one with your arrow are x8's.  The x16's are above there where the dashed lines head down and to the right.  Then your x8's are actually the x32's.

It does get confusing.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Your x2 longs are x4 ... and the sells you point with the arrow are x8

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yes Ata, better read spyderman replies ... are more understandables than mines.

i think the problem is the 10 pip grid. It's just too susceptible to news spikes, etc. don't think a larger grid would be as bad.  Could be wrong though

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I make use of both of your explanations.. many thanks Kfx and Spyderman.. I fully understood ..

P.S: To all newcomers and members who are sending their regards.. thanks to all of you for thanking Kfx, spyderman, etc. etc. you all are welcome

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Kfx and spyderman, one question.

I understood, at the beginning, that we must wait for a step before open an hedging-martingala grid.

In your pic, I see transition from a xN grid to a x2N grid directly without jump over a level (ex. first sell at 1.3190 instead of 1.3180).

I'm sure it's a my problem and I don't understand.....

Can you help me?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
It looks that way at first glance, but if you look closer.  You would have taken the first x2 sell at 1.3180.  That hit take profit at 1.3170 where another sell was placed.  Then price moved up and you took another sell at 1.3180 and then again at 1.3190.  Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
It's tricky looking at a full chart and following the trades.  You eye always goes too far to the right to where the trades end up.

Try and concentrate on each candle as it would have happened in real time.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Welcome to the thread.  It's going to be very hard to put it all on 1 chart.  Just too much going on.  ATA's working on a nice flow chart that's very descriptive, so that will be a great help when he's done.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Thanks kaczucha.. your answer concentrates purely on "the close of 1x sells" and so you are following the first rule of "avoiding a possible range" by waiting for price to fall one more level . I clearly understood your logic but yes, I want to wait till Kfx or Spyderman shares their thoughts.

In 3 scenarios price still goes down so my questions are focusing on 4x for now. Later I will prepare scenarios where price comes back and triggers x4 Inside Grid.

And catextract.... welcome back bro.. so in your answer I see that you follow the 30 pips rule already. But the 30 pips rule is only triggered if you have one 1x grid open and one 2x grid open and the distance between them is 30 pips. In all 3 scenarios this is never the case. I see your logic but that's another step which I will ask soon. But many thanks for participating.. that's all what we need

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hello, work the EA?.... thanks

Hey guys...nice of you to all be working while I slept...

You got the idea Kaczucha.  In all 3 you TP on the x1's and then you start the x4's 1 level below that point.

Hi Folks,

Thanks to spyderman for answering the first part of my question.. here the further part of my question regarding to "Hedge x4"

Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Black dot - nothing

Gray dot - nothing

Blue dot - x4 sell (1st) --- there is 50 pips between x1 & x2 grids, you wait for 1/2 way (25 pips) and then go to next level closest to oldest open grid (x1)

Orange dot - TP on 1st x4 - place 2nd x4 sell

Red dot - TP on 2nd x4 - place 3rd x4 sell

Green dot - TP on 3rd x4 - place 4th x4 sell

Red circle - place 5th x4 sell (4th & 5th now open)

Orange circle - place 6th sell (4th, 5th & 6th open)

Blue, Gray & Black circles - nothing...you have two outside grids open (x1 & x2) and the x4 inside grid. Now you wait until either the x2 or x1 grid closes and then start the x8 1 level beyond that TP

Hey 217.  Welcome to the thread and thanks for the input.

Have you checked with the thread OP before introducing totally new ideas to his thread.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Some "brainstorming" ideas for further experimentations:

1. First batch entry is in "trend direction":

Buy: When price comes from BELOW and touch a grid level (level 1)
Sell: When price comes from ABOVE and touch a grid level (level 1)

Reasoning: To keep "friendship with the trend" starting from Level1 of Original Batch. (All further "H" Level entries are in "trend direction", so why not first one, too?)

2. Not moving original TP levels when Level2 and Level3 trades are activated.

TP: Next level (10 pips)

If the price drops 10 pips, add a buy (level 2) ... keep TP

If the price drops 10 pips more, add a buy (level 3) ... keep TP

Reasoning: Just by keeping the original TP, we can DOUBLE the profit of each Original Batch (after Level3 entry).

For example:

Moving TP to Level1: Level1+Level2+Level3 PT = 0 + 10 + 20 = +30 pips
Keeping original TP:  Level1+Level2+Level3 PT = 10 + 20 + 30= +60 pips

Hi Guys,

this is a great thread and has real potential, but what is a concern is that we're already trying to change the original concept when  most still haven't grasped it.

Shouldn't we get the rules set in stone before we start tinkering ?

Eamonn.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Good point Eamonn, but as it has been "pointed out" by me, the above ideas fall into the "brainstorming" category.

The "stone set" rules were logical and straightforward, at least for me. Only the Stop Loss was not determined, but as with most strategies it belongs to the "subjective" and "individual" category as everybody has different risk tolerance and it can vary on a large scale. So in this regard, I propose that SL is to be decided individually by each user (i.e. when to close a Martingale batch in loss and start the series again). At max. we might come up with "reasonable" risk settings and a "reasonable" SL, but I would not set them in stone.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hey FX...

Worth looking at for sure.  Not sure why Kfx may have set it up as a "countertrend" method.  Have to wait and see what he says.  Also look at other pairs/charts to see if it consistently makes a difference.

I suspect in trending markets you'll see an advantage to your idea and in ranging then the countertrend may be more profitable.  Of course we never know ahead of time which one we'll see.

On the TP side.  Same here.  I think your idea has merit.  Again, depending on what Kfx thinks, we'll have to look at some charts.

I might do a side by side this weekend for a longer period on EU to compare the two

I was curious to see how the "modified version" would have behaved on June 20th, 2013, as this and the following days were used as an example of "Hedgex32", i.e. it was a challening period for the strategy.

Well, if we would have been satisfied with a 100 pips gain, the strategy would have closed all trades at the top of the trend with 140 pips profit:

Attached Image

In case 100 pips were not enough, the modified version would have given another chance to close with 340 pips at the bottom of the countertrend:

Attached Image

So the TP is another crucial issue, as not being satisfied with 100 or 300 pips profit may lead to additional major hedges, DDs and strain on the leverage.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Short term results depend a lot on where we start the series. As an experiment I started with August 4th (Monday) with the "modified" settings.

Results were rolled over from one day to another, and on the below chart of August 8th the week's summary is shown: +230 pips equity gain for the week, using no more than Hedgex2.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Well, I backtested FX's idea on the EurUsd from Jan 1 of this year to present.

I used a 50pip grid instead of the 10 as that is what I am using.

The results were interesting as well as a bit surprising.

Using Kfx's original methodology, we would net 5600 pips for the current year.  We can balance that nice return with some good sized drawdown as we got to the x16 grid sizing.

Now using the mod that FX is talking about over the same time period, we only netted 2700 pips.

Doesn't sound to good.  The surprising part though is that it never went past the x2.

So lower pip output, but with much less risk and DD.

I'll go over my charts again to make sure that's right but I believe so.

Now why would we have those differences.

I think the main difference is with the TP not being moved to BE after the first entry of a grid (I don't think the direction of a series first trade will have much impact over all).  This results in fewer grids being traded due to the TP being further away, so that means fewer pips overall.

Plus, with higher grid multiples, you have some big pip winners that just aren't there at the x1 and x2 level...with their corresponding higher DD.

As far as the multipliers staying low, I think that is due primarily to the greater payoff from not moving the TP on those orders.  Now on a 3 trade grid you get 300 pips instead of 150 and on a 2 trade grid you get 150 pips instead of 50.  That enables you to close those series much faster as the greater payoff (say on the x2 grid) will more quickly erase the running loss on the x1 grid.

Will be interesting to see what Kfx thinks about this.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
FYI...on the FX's mod I was in my 5th series by August 8th.  On the original method I still only in my 2nd

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Good info spiderman! How big would be the DD for original method to the FX's method?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Almost 10:1. 4150 on original...450 on FX mod.

There seems to be a huge difference here.  I encourage anyone to check my numbers.  Maybe later I'll do a different pair for comparison.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
This may indicate that method 2 can be traded at a size of 10 times larger. Assume on original method, we are risking $4150 (at $1 per pip) to get reward of $5600. Method 2 we can risk $4500 (at $10 per pip) to get reward of $27,000.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
FXguru, on your method, I think a x2 buy should be opened at the price hike at 1.33895.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Did a quick backtest on the GbpJpy for the year, again using a 50 pip grid.

The original method didn't do well.  Before I got half way through February I had already hit x64...so pretty much a blown account.

On the modified, ended up with 5160 pips for the year.  Only got up to x8 with about 1600 pips DD.

Pretty impressive.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Thanks, Spyderman! Great job.  You have saved my Sunday! (I just wonder how could you go through 7 months' worth of data so fast...)

As Wilsonch has put it right, even if the modified strategy results in smaller pip gains, the associated smaller (DD) risk allows to run it on a smaller account, so the profit percentage multiples. So we really need to look at the combined picture of absolute gain, DD risk and margin requirement.

One more "brainstorming" idea about TP: It seems that the Hedge function (esp. at x16, x32) can be a "big moneymaker", however, it is a double edged sword as these hedge levels require large margins standing by all the time (tying down funds, creating higher "exposure" and reducing % profit), so - in my opinion - the Hedge function should be used primarily as an "Exit Strategy" (as soon as possible), and not as additional "moneymaker".

What I am trying to say is that the TP should be "reasonable" after deploying Hedge positions, i.e. to let the Hedges do their "job": TO PROVIDE A GRACIOUS and PROFITABLE EXIT.

Personally I would use the combined profit of Level1+Level2+Level3 of the Original Batch as TP when Hedge positions are in play. Using the Modified Version it would be: 10+20+30 pips, i.e. 60 pips max. TP. In other words: whenever the total combined profit (closed + floating) of a batch reaches 60 pips, all positions are closed and a new series is started.

To summarize the expected advantages:Smaller, but more frequent profits in the bank (instead of larger floating profits while being exposed to random market moves). Closing and starting batches more often would result in significantly reduced need of deploying large Hedge multipliers (i.e. "desperate exit strategies"). There is a good chance that even Hx8 would not be needed, as KFx's idea is so robust. Less chance of large multipliers = smaller fund exposure ==> less risk, less strain on the margin, less anxiety ==> better sleep. Less chance of large multipliers = smaller margin requirement ==> higher Profit percentage even with smaller absolute pip gain. For example: by being able to reduce the required margin by only 30%, the expected profit return would go up by 42%, while a 50% margin reduction would literally DOUBLE the Profit (%) with the same exact absolute pip gain. I would like to use the opportunity to emphasize that the basic strategy is KFx's idea and all credits should go to him.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
by the way GoldenEA, regarding your EA:

what does ClsPercnt does?

There is not option for setting TP in number of pips? So the EA closes/TP based on the OrderGap?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
@wilsonch

You are right; excellent observation. I was following the Page1 "3. To avoid a possible range, we will wait for the price moves one more level" rule ALL THE TIME, but apparently KFx has started to employ it only from Hx4. It was an oversight on my part, however, in my opinion it is an excellent rule, so I would use it even from Hx2.

So "retrospectively" the Modified Version employs the "we will wait for the price moves one more level" rule even for Hx2 trades.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Fx.

I guess it's important to add another rule:

3. Fixing rules to start the grid.

As you can see in your pics, the first trade (or the first signal) can drive the grid in one direction or another. Subsequently its end and the new grid's start....and so on.

So I guess we need a "trigger signal" (expecially trend trigger signal). Perhaps a simple 2 MAs cross or another one.

Whato do you think about?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
@xlcharly

You are right, a decent "starter signal" would be handy.

On the other, it may not be necessary as the strategy might work equally well in both directions on the long run. Especially considering the fact that after closing a batch the strategy would immediately open a new batch at the next 00 level without looking at any further starter signal.

In other words: except for the very first trade, all the rest would be almost random. One might make a decision whether the new batch should start in "microtrend" or "counter microtrend" direction, as described in the "Modified Version".

I might even add - only as a further "brainstorming" idea - that the strategy could be deployed even IN BOTH DIRECTIONS at the same time and let both batches run their courses.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Now I have a headache...

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Another solid idea FX.   I had thought of something similar myself.

I think that obviously goes more to MM and I would definitely like to spend more time figuring that out, especially once we nail down the basic method.

Hopefully Kfx will be here soon to comment on all this.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Not so bad when you're using a 50 pip grid...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #389 ---
mmmmm.....sounds good......totally agree!

Yu say to start both strategies at the same time?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Yes, that's the idea, i.e. starting one "First Batch" in "counter microtrend" direction (as mentioned in KFx's original strategy in Post1) and another one in "microtrend" direction (as mentioned in the Modified Version). Nevertheless, it is just a "brainstorming" idea (came to mind on a lazy Sunday morning) which needs further exploration.

Advantages:
1. More profits (harvesting both directions).
2. Potential "auto-hedging". The branch in DD would be partially balanced by the other branch taking profits.

Disadvantages:

1. Synchronicity would be random, as batches would close and open at different times and possibly in the same direction, so trades might be duplicated and DD could be even higher. Theoretically it might be prevented by initiating the "next First Batch" direction always against the direction of the most recent Hedge (or the "First Batch").
2. Larger margin is needed to run both directions, although the same issue would apply if using the strategy on multiple pairs.
3. More difficult to automate.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
....trying to continue your thinking.....

I've considered the worst scenario (nightmare scenario) for every grids: a narrow range market!

Let's see the pics.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

in pic.1 we have up a grid with Kfx's original strategy and down your startegy.

As you can see, depending as price moves in the range, one strategy can help the other or disadvantage it.

But at the beginning we don't know which is the best strategy.

So I guess the solution is a careful MM.

In the second pic, I've pointed out a period (blue rectangles) in which the total gain is +60 pips.

At the end of the day, in opposite, the total loss is -160 pips.

Anyway, if we use both strategies, as you correctly said, we can suppose a lowest DD (for a sort of hedging effect).

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hmmm. At first look it seems overly complicated to me. I think I'd rather diversify into other pairs. However, perhaps further reflection will change my opinion

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Yes, I agree. Diversification might be a better idea, as running these strategies at opposite directions can be pretty complicated even for an EA (once we get there). Employing an EA will be unavoidable as this "24/5" strategy cannot be traded manually by a single person.

Is there an EA based on this strategy? It would be easier to test it with an EA.

(I saw mghEA_v1, but I think this is not appropriate)

On August 7th, the ORIGINAL (KFx's) version has performed much better on GBP/NZD. The good news is that both versions closed the day with NET EQUITY GAIN.

Running the two strategies simultaneously (without intentional attention to entry direction) would have had some balancing effect, however, each strategy would have started August 8th with -330 pips floating DD at Hx4. Not so good.

Adjusting synchronicity even by EAs would be extremely difficult, so I scratch the idea of simultaneous and opposite direction entries...

Just to see what would have happened on August 7th on GBP/NZD (although due to its large spread I would not have used this pair):

We should test this double grid strategy with an Ea. I'm agree with moncsicsi.

And why not trying two grids (one for each strategy) shifted for 1/2 step? Example, one grid 1.9860-1.9870-1.9880.....and the other 1.9865-1.9875-1.9885....

Maybe too many points for a brainstorming!

I think this strategy can be a significant challenge for most programmers, which is why only manual backtesting has been done so far.

I think we can agree that it is a promising strategy, as most Martingales are, except when the "Death Trades" comes. Then it is not so pretty. Personally I would like to see the toughest days for this strategy before getting into programming. The most valuable would be to see a series of unmanageable days leading to the "Death Trades", because we need to know the "worst case scenario" and also, once we find such days, the strategy needs to be made even safer.

So please post ANY DAYS on ANY CURRENCY which you think would have been a major challenge (or unmanageable situation) for this Martingale/Hedge strategy.

One more "brainstorming" idea about TP:

ORIGINAL:
First Batch: 10 or 30 pips.
Hedgex2: 100 pips
Hedgex4: 250 pips
Hedgex8: 1000 pips
Hedgex16: ? pips

ALTERNATIVE I:
First Batch: 10, 30 or 60 pips (as per Modified Strategy)
Hedgex2: 30 vs. 60 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex4: 30 vs. 60 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex8: 30 vs. 60 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex16: 30 vs. 60 pips (Original vs. Modified)In this case we would use Hedge trades simply to get the maximum we would get from First Batches.
ALTERNATIVE II:
First Batch: 10, 30 or 60 pips (as per Modified Strategy)
Hedgex2: 120 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex4: 240 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex8: 500 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex16: 1000 pips (Original vs. Modified)
Hedgex32: 2000 pips (Original vs. Modified)This alternative multiples the maximum profit we would get from First Batches by the number of the most recently used Hedge multiplier.

Hi

Why complicate stuff.

A martingail system will always profit IF YOUR POCKETS ARE DEEP ENOUGH? So the death trade comes when you catch a trend.

A grid system will buy (enter) trades with a trend.

Why not combine the 2 systems?

While martingail goes into massive drawdown the grid system will pile up the pips. It will hedge you against drawdown.

The martingail will double the lots with every entry but the grid will not double its lots. Maybe the distance of the grid must be smaller than the martingail.

You will always be heavily towards the martingail. Can this be made in ea?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Ultimately that's a decision for each trader to make. Its nor as if everyone has to take the same

My greater concern is lot sizing. Typically I base that on desired risk factored with stop loss size. Obviously that's not applicable here so have to try and determine in advance our risk to help determine sizing

--- 帖子 #401 ---
If I may attempt to read between the lines, you're attempting to devise a system that is capable of surviving, despite its having a martingale component.

Price movement is pretty much random, hence you must assume that if you trade for long enough, you'll encounter every conceivable price pattern; or put another way, all price patterns are equally likely to occur, albeit in an unknown sequence. Grid systems are especially vulnerable, in that they don't perform analysis specifically aimed at identifying and trading only situations that offer potential bias. If the price sample being traded is ostensibly random, then, it also means that all systems, no matter how simple or complex, have an equal chance of success or failure.

If you are serious about risk management, you must attempt to calculate the probability of account loss, and then somehow find a MM model that reduces this risk as much as possible. I expect that this will prove to be your biggest challenge.

No comment.
Well, I did my best, given the latitude that you allowed me.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
yes, it's good idea. I have thought it before.

While it bring smaller risk (use gird to hedge), also bring smaller profit.

And the problem is the SL/TP of your gird. There are many details confused me.

Welcome your wise opinion~

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi

I do not understand "smaller profits"? You get double profits when you hit a long trend. It is like having 2 separate EA's. In normal conditions both will profit. In trend both will profit again, while one hedges the other's draw down.

Only problem with martingale is if you hit a long trend.

Grid will make profit because it follows the trend. Grid can even enter at pull backs

Martingale will profit as soon as trend turns around.

Grid only starts when 2nd trade of Martingale enters. Close all (Martingale and grid) when martingale profits. See what the grid gives.

Somebody write a EA and lets see what happens?

Hi Kfx

This is a very well thought out system and probably the best I have seen with regards to grid trading, however like all grid and martingale systems you will I think eventually blow your account.

Great work anyway.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
is this correct as i understand modified version of mgh.

buy/ sell 1 lot on grid level 1 .............tp=10/30/60

grid level 2 buy / sell with 2 lot.................tp=10/30/60

grid level 3 buy / sell with 4 lot.....tp=10/30/60

as so on. this correct '''''

in other word buy stop / sell stop order having multiplying lot on having constant grid level having fix take profit.

is this correct.......

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I agree to concentrate our efforts more on risk and money management than technical issues, as it seems that small modificiations (incl. entry direction at round numbers and First Batch targets) do not really matter.

Each Martingale strategy has a "Death Pattern" or "Death Trail", i.e. a series of specific market moves which lead to the death of the account. Similarly to an imaginary "Death Labyrinth", which has thousands of paths to safe exits, except for one, which leads to a death trap. I call this one path the "Death Trail" which we should avoid by reducing its statistical chance of getting on it.

What can reduce the statistical chance of getting on the "Death Trail":

1. Reducing the lots (with a given margin).
2. Reducing Target Profit. The purpose of it would be getting an early chance to start a "new sequence", i.e. a new First Batch again. Each time we get back to "First Batch" we reset the distance to the "death exit" and statistical chance of getting on the the "Death Trail". In other words: at Hedgex16 the statistical chance of travelling through the "Death Trail" is significantly higher than at the start of a "First Batch" or even at "Hedgex2".

In addition to the reducing the statistical risk of getting on a "Death Trail" it is equally important to collect reasonable profits, so finding the balance between these two would be the ultimate goal.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Paracelsus..

Thak you for sharing info about the "Death Trail" possibility.. regarding to that I would also like to share my conclusion about MGH after studying it since the thread started (and I am still studying it):

Let's say we are trading the 5M Timeframe AND we believe the 1H trend is LONG:

Then, if we luckily have started buying inside an Elliott-Wave 2 retracement (or at least a place near fibo 50, 61.8) of a long trend on 1H chart, our SIMPLE strategy will work so nicely.

Even if we have to open a HedgeX2 short trail for a while, since we assume the big trend is upwards, sooner or later price will go up, leave 3 HedgeX2 shorts open, but will close the SimpleX1 long trail that we had to leave open earlier and it will end up with a successful HedgeX4 long trail with a nice profit over+250 pips.

---> but I have to repeat: This situation could happen only if we could have started inside a 2nd Elliott Wave of a long trend of 1H chart (or fibo levels 50,61.8).

So.. this means we end up with the exact same question all Elliott Wave fanatics ask themselves: How will we be sure we are inside an Elliott Wave 2 of the overall trend?

In a nutshell: If you want to trade with MGH strategy, try to detect a 2nd EW and start there. Starting anywhere else is pure luck or at least it will easily lead you to x8 or higher hedge situations I think.

P.S: Replace all my "long" words with "short", and all "short" words with "long" and you will get the downtrend version of the same idea.

Happy Trades

No I think what FX meant by the 10/30/60 is that would be the variance in take profit on x1 based on whether you had 1, 2 or 3 orders open.  The TP for all 3 trades is 1 level away from the 1st entry.  So if you have just entry 1 and it hits TP then 10 pips on a 10 pip grid.  If you have 2 open, the 1st is 10 pip TP and the 2nd is 20pips...so 30 pips total.   If you have 3 orders open the 1st is 10 pips, 2nd 20 pips and the 3rd is 30 pips...so 60 pips total.   10/30/60

David,

Much respect and thanks for commenting.  I was wondering when you would stumble by, as I've followed your thoughts on many martingalesque threads over the years.  As always your take is always well thought out and logical.

I tend to agree with your thoughts in general and on this specifically, especially about the quoted nature of price movement being pretty random, especially in the short term... What is price doing next...up? down? flat?  No knows.

However I would hesitate to conclude that, because price movements in general are random, that that would necessarily mean that a trader will encounter every conceivable price pattern or that all patterns are equally likely to occur.

The reason I say that is because, while price movement may be random, there are non-random forces in play in the market that will, at the least mitigate, if not prevent certain "patterns" from manifesting themselves.

For example, in a totally random data set, it would seem evident that one possible outcome of market movement would be a price action that continues up and up with no retracements whatsoever.  However, that isn't feasible in the markets we trade...especially forex.

Nation currencies are involved, and those nations interests are tied to the valuation of their currencies.  Nations can and do take steps to keep their currencies from inflating or deflating past a certain point.  They're not always entirely successful, but the effect of what they attempt isn't random and does affect price patterns.

Investors, fund managers, national banks, etc. take profits and the like based on price movement and that changes order flow, so again those actions effect price patterns in a non-random fashion.

It would seem possible then, and perhaps that is just wishful thinking, to devise a trading system with elements of martingale and grid trading, that is flexible enough to take advantage of these non-random price movements.  At least enough to siphon off some profits from the system.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Well, it seems we have a group of enthusiasts and experts getting together here. All inputs are appreciated. Ata-Turkoglu is right about getting an "edge" with the "First Batch" entry, however, waiting for the "right moment" might rob us of precious other opportunities to make profit.

Getting back to the "Death Trail": with any Maringale, its statistical chance/occurance should be calculated. On purely mathematical basis it would be practically impossible, however, a 10-year backtest would give a "good idea".

For example: If the strategy gets onto the "Death Trail" once every year (statistically) losing 50% of the account value, but makes 15% per month, then - statistically - it is winner strategy (11 x 15% - 1 x 50% = 110%). Lets say it encounters the "Death Trail" twice a year: 10 x 15% - 2 x 100% = 50% per year. Still not bad. Of course, the two 50% losses may come one after an other, so I would experiment to find the right balance between profit and "Death Trail" risk until the statistical chance of getting on the "Death Trail" would be less than ONE occasion per year. Again, there are no guarantees, one has to play the statistical chances as in any gambling.

One might argue that it is not a "trading strategy" in its real sense. I agree. But I could not care less from my luxury yacht cruising the Caribbean Islands...

Spyderman,

Great points.

You’re correct, of course. The probability of price moving (say) 50 pips in an hour is always going to be greater than its moving 5,000 pips. Or you could just as easily have argued that there are an infinite number of possible patterns, and since nobody lives long enough to trade for an infinite amount of time, it’s impossible for them to encounter every conceivable pattern.

The only thing I would query in your post is that IMO central bank intervention is perhaps one of the biggest causes of unexpected spikes and outlier-type patterns.

I still stand by what I said as a broadbrush principle, even if it’s not absolutely correct, i.e. that it’s nigh impossible to anticipate all of the permutations that the market will throw at you, and thus build a system that is absolutely safe from an incalculable number of one-off possibilities. Or put more simply, how can you expect the unexpected?

IMO this is an absolute must read for anybody who’s developing a system, martingale or otherwise. These guys are much more experienced and knowledgeable traders than I’ll EVER be (soultrader was something of a legend when he used to post here at FF). Here’s the conclusion that they reached: “One thing is for sure. no matter how good your system appears to be, no matter how much money it has already made and no matter how much confidence and testing you put into it - sooner or later a market condition will surface which you haven't seen before. we never know what is around the corner, you could run the gauntlet and have 10 years or more of great results. but sooner or later the market will throw off a wild one.”

I guess that summarizes the message that I was trying to convey.

I want to respect the OP’s wishes, and not disrupt the flow of the thread, so I’ll leave it at that. And in any case, there’s no point in repeating material that I’ve posted many times in other martingale threads.

I wish everybody great success with this system.

Respect,

David

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Excellent observations and very true quotation, David. Thanks. I totally agree about its validity for "trading systems".

As I have already mentioned I consider this Martingale/Hedge strategy not a "trading system" in its classical sense. Why? For this strategy does not really matter which direction the market goes, it should just go "somewhere" without encountering a few specific price movement patterns which lead to the "Death Trade". (The theoretically possible pathways to the "Death Trade" I call "Death Trails".) In this sense, it is more like a gambling strategy applied to the Forex markets, so it may be wiser to approach it with a "GAME THEORY" mindset.

There are infinite price patterns (pathways) from "First Batch/First Trade" to one of the final outcomes: Winning or Losing. Among these there are infinite "Winner Trails", however, there are only "finite", i.e. limited number of "Death Trails". Just as a very simplified Roulette example: If you played "red/black" Martingale and you bet on red, the "Death Trail" of sequences would be: all black. In this case there is only one "Death Trail". This strategy's potential outcomes are much more complex than in roulette, not to mention other variables (TP, SL, MM) which makes it a more promising "game" than roulette, but also more challenging.

It seems that this thread is losing stream, especially that the inventor, KFx has not commented on any brainstorming ideas. Anyway, even if this thread dies off, future Martingale enthusiasts should find some "pearls" in this thread, so I encourage them to read it.

Paracelsus,

I just wanted to acknowledge your post. I don't have any suggestions on how the grid can be improved, and the OP has asked that the thread doesn't evolve into a martingale discussion, so there's nothing really constructive that I can contribute.

Anyway, good luck, I believe that you're asking the right kind of questions, and I hope that you find some worthwhile answers.

Hi FxMasterGuru.

Thank you for your own efforts on improving the system.

Welcome Back, Kfx!

As you have indicated and as I mentioned in my "game theory approach", we should concentrate on the "worst case scenario" with any setup, i.e. the chance of being forced to go through one of the many "Death Trail" price patterns.

Also excellent observation by you that the grid size should be dynamically adjusted to the given pair's volatility.

Kind regards,

Hey Kfx...Welcome back.

Here's a shot of the GbpJpy I'm trading on a 50 pip grid.  I missed some trade last night with the big move on the Gbp.  I had been thinking the grid might be small for the GJ and now this morning you guys are talking about adjusting the grid to the ATR.  I think that's a good idea.

Hey all.

In line with what Hanover was talking about, I wanted to do a longer term backtest on the system. I went back and started with 2001 and got some interesting results.

Just the 2nd series in, I hit some major DD. 11,800 pips worth. Now in 2001 the ATR on EurUsd was much larger, so again, IMO a 50 pip grid would not have been big enough. Before I go any further, I'm going to figure out the historic ATR (or at least an approximation) and modify the grid as I move through the history and see how that may change things.

Anyways...food for thought.

Great spyderman.

It will be hard work to make this long backtest manually.

Just some words on general Trading, about the expiry date of the systems.

One of the keys that have helped me in the way of Forex has been diversification.

I am sure that a system will not win forever, so we always must have several systems and diversify our capital. Retire those that not work and put more money in those that having more success.

And above all, think this is always an ongoing research and development of new systems and improving what we already have.

I got the data from fxhistoricaldata.com and then imported it into MT4.  They only have H1 or daily though.

Does anyone know of an easy way to show ATR for a given time period...say year to year.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
It seems that if you had applied Kfx's original method (i.e. moving TP to Level1 after Level2 entry) your results would have been significantly different and better.

By using larger grids, price has much smaller statistical chance to move an additional 50 pips to TP (after Level2/3 entries), than to travel an additional 10 pips, as I proposed in the modified version.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Thanks! I would need at least 15M to test my theory...

I noticed the same thing on the 2001 data.  However on the current year, when I backtested, it seemed that your TP mod worked much better.  It me out of a series much faster and without extending the grids to the higher multipliers.

Okay boys and girls.  Been working a little bit on the 13 year EurUsd backtest this afternoon.

So first stage is 1/1/2001  -  5/20/2002.  The reason I went into 2002 was that I had a long series in DD that it took until then to close.

Sooooo.... you may remember earlier that I tried this on a 50 pip grid and it blew up in 2001 right out of the gates.

This time fared better, but not great.

I took the current daily ATR at the beginning of each series and used that for the grid size for that series.  Seemed to make a lot more sense adjusting the grid to the volatility of the pair.

So for stage 1 I went through 16 cycles (the last of which was 9 months long...

Total pips for the stage was 5,130

Curiously, there were only 2 of the series even went past the x1 multiplier.

The first had a DD of 900 pips and went to x2.

The second (already mentioned) had a DD of 5,060 pips and reached the x16 stage.

Draw what conclusion you will.  I'll continue to work on the backtest as I'm able.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Stage 2

5/20/2002 -  5/19/2003

11 series...again the last one was 10 months this time...weird.

Anyways only 1 series (the last of course) went past x1.  It only went to x4 but just wouldn't close due to a continued uptrend which didn't allow the TP's on the x4 to overcome the DD from the 3 open x2 trades.  Total DD on that series was 4,880 pips with the yearly take at 1,915 pips

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Stage 3

5/19/2003  -  12/31/2003

Nice clean 12 series.  Got to x2 a couple of times.

Worst drawdown was 660 pips.

2,645 pips total.

Stage 4 was pretty crappy.

May be a suggestion, set a limit on losses? How many positions where the system is winning and how many where it is not? If we have more figures where MGH developed winning positions than where it didn’t, hence set a limit in pips to losses may seem like a good strategy?

I don't use Martingaling per se (I don't double up) and can't hedge (I'm in the U.S. -- which blows, by the way), but I can offer a couple of tips nevertheless with respect to grid sizing, since I use directional grids for certain types of trades.

A hedging grid system is non-directional, meaning that you set up your hedging grid in relation to current price without regard to the direction the pair is moving. In comparison, Martingaling is a counter-trend system that trades in a direction opposite the trend and waits to take advantage of a retrace. The two systems, I think, are distinct, since a gridded hedging system does not necessarily require Martingaling to be successful.

At any rate, two things are critical with Martingaling: (1) grid size; and (2) point of entry.

With respect to grid size: too big a grid and you never hit your levels; too small a grid and the doubling of lot size essential to the success of the system becomes quickly overwhelming, since the first position is 1x lots, the second 2x lots, the third 4x lots, the fourth, 8x lots, and so on and so forth. Martingale systems that double the lot sizes as each level in the grid is hit without limits as to the doubling or drawdown generally fail in short order.

Set a sensible limit as to the total size of the net position that will result from all the levels being hit without retrace in relation to your equity. For example, if you have $10,000 equity, limiting the doubling to .01 lot, .02 lots, .04 lots, .08 lots (for a total of .15 lots) would probably be reasonable, since the total exposure would be less than 2 x equity. Additionally, using stop losses will provide additional equity protection should the anticipated retracement not occur.

Determining an appropriate grid size, in my mind, is pair specific. For example, a pair like EUR/CHF experiences far less intraday movement than a pair like GBP/NZD. While you might arguably space your grid 5 pips apart for a pair like EUR/CHF (Daily ATR is currently 18 pips) (point in fact, that would probably not be worth it due to spread), that would make little sense with GBP/NZD, whose current Daily ATR is currently about 120 pips. In short, the grid should be sized to the pair, taking into account an ATR of some kind, whether it be Daily, Weekly, or some other time frame.

As far as point of entry is concerned, I would suggest that if you are going to use a Martingale system at all, you do not do it without regard to obvious S/R. For example, if you follow USD/JPY at all, you'll realize that 103.00 is an area that has provided resistance in the past. Price is driving up currently toward that level. Purely as an example, you would set up the following grid to take advantage of a retrace that the pair is likely to experience at the 103.00 level:

Sell 1x lots at 102.40/set target price for position to 102.30

Sell 2x lots at 102.60/move target price for net position to 102.50

Sell 4x lots at 102.80/move target price for net position to 102.70

Sell 8 x lots at 103.00/move target price for net position to 102.90

You can also use Pivot Points or Fib retracements/extension levels for this purpose, looking for retracements at particular levels such as the S3/R3 or the .764/.236. (Me personally, in the above example, I would probably just fashion a single entry order to short USD/JPY at the resistance level ... .)

Ultimately, you can see why an EA might be useful for this system. You either have to keep your eyes on the charts to adjust the target price as your grid levels are hit or have an EA that will adjust the target prices for you as the grid levels are hit.

Lastly, and again while I cannot use hedging here in the United States, pay attention to swap/rollover fees. They are frequently not the same on the buy side as they are on the sell, and some of them can be quite onerous (GBP/NZD swap: 3.76 on the sell side, a whopping -8.32 on the buy).

In my opinion the "beauty" of this strategy is:that it combines the advantages of Hedging, Grid and Martingale, and the final profit of a basket comes when the market starts trending. In other words: it is not a usual Martingale which "bets" against the trend, but its Grid/Martingale component "bets" against the retracements of a trend, and profits nicely when the market moves again in trend direction. Diversification (i.e. running it on multiple pairs), position sizing and setting reasonable SL/TP levels are vital prerequisites for this strategy, which should be seriously considered if anyone is planning to trade it on a live account. The real challenge is finding the "right settings"...

--- 帖子 #465 ---
So much for USD/JPY resistance at 103.00 ... .  Blew right through that on weak Japanese trade data.

But if you'd taken that Martindale trade example, you'd only need the pair to retrace 40 pips to hit your target price ... .

Has any tried to run this with a broker like Oanda?

Oanda's set-up is kind of different in the respect that you don't buy lots, but rather single units of the currency.  I imagine that this is to allow for micro account traders to trade more proportionally to their equity size.  With brokers like FXCM (not to knock them; most brokers are set up the same way), you're confined to 1K increments.  Naturally, if you have huge equity, this is not a problem, but for smaller account traders (I would say $10,000 or less), Martingaling even with 1K lots could get you in trouble fairly quickly, depending upon how your grid is set up.

Now, setting up with 1 unit sizes, you could double 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 before trouble would begin to appear on the horizon.  However, I guess the trouble there would be if you consistently hit your target price around the 3 or 4th doubling and very rarely hit it at higher doubling levels.  You'd frequently make next to nothing ... .

Hi guys. How is everything?

I've been working on trying to mitigate the high drawdown as possible. So far I have not succeeded, but I'm working on it and in new ways to create the grids. I hope soon to give you good news and ideas to work on it.

Best wishes to all.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi ZebraSquirl!

Yes, Oanda is a good broker to try this system starting with 1 unit. I think there is some other MT4 brokers with nano accounts starting with 100 units (0.001 lots).

The only problem with Oanda is that hedging is not allowed due the NFA rules, even in Oanda Eaurope division.

The only solution for that is to open 2 subaccounts, one for Buy's and another for Sell's.

--- 帖子 #471 ---

Look forward to seeing what you come up with.

I use ForexBrokerInc. for micro/nano accounts.  They offer 1,000 unit lots and you can trade .01 lots.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi spyderman.

1.000 units (0.01 lots) is micro, not nano/cent account. I think nano/cent account would be 100 units (0.001) ..... [Not 0.0001,Sorry my mistake in previosus post, fixed now]

example in USD micro account ........... 1 pip x 0.01 lots = 10 cents.

example in USD nano/cent account ... 1 pip x 0.001 lots = 1 cent.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
As mentioned before, keeping the TP reasonably small (e.g. 30-60 pips) and unchanged - i.e. even after initiation of H2, H4, H8 hedges - would give a chance to get out of baskets sooner and therefore limiting the risk of large DD (which is obviously increased while waiting for larger profits after multiple hedging).

Also, setting a reasonable and tolerable fix SL is a must.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
This kind of points out why forbidding hedging is stupid.  The work around for that is to buy in one account and sell in another account.  It is stupid that I have to set up two accounts to do this.

Unfortunately, no good, similar workaround for FIFO ... .

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hey spyderman, you have a PM ...

Anyway, later I'll post an entry criterion for the system, which I'm working.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Sounds good. Do you have some example of the worst trade (SL reached) and how many pips you lost vs. how many pips you win?

But in a "Hedge x8", you can have more than 500 pips DD ... If the TP is 60 we will need 8/9 win trades to cover 1 loss. Surely I'm wrong and maybe I have not understood your point. It would be great you post some chart.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
@Kfx
You are absolutely correct. The main question is the statistical probability of getting a full SL (e.g. 1000 pips) in relation to the accumulated profits.

If this ratio were for example 1:20, it means that the strategy may safely encounter one full (i.e. 1000 pips) SL for 19 x 60 pips "profit units". I did not mention "60 pips target profit" intentionally in the previous sentence, as profits may also come from smaller 10 pips "profit bites", 30 pips "small baskets" and the usual 60 pips "large baskets" (according to my "modified version").

I am about to backtest the statistical probability of getting hit by 1000, 1500 and 2000 pips Stop Losses in relation to the accumulated profits during a certain time period. My HYPOTHESIS (which I want to confirm) is that the long term statistical chance of getting full SL-triggering "price patterns" is very low in relation to collecting adequate and profitable amount of 10, 30 and 60 pips profits.

By SL I don't mean risking the whole account: one full Stop Loss should not be more than 10% of the account, but preferably less.

I agree with you.

Yes, It is all a about studying the system for several years, to have solid statistics on which base our SL's, TP's and other parameters.

We should also be in mind (as already mentioned some members before) the size of the grid based on an ATR, ADR or whatever indicator. I think that this could alleviate a extremely high DD, as such, in EU we can use a 10 pip grid now in 2014 where the breadth of the market is relatively low, but not in 2006 where was higher.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Sorry about that.  Thought I had responded.  You've got one now...

--- 帖子 #483 ---
That is the plan, i.e. several years of backtests measuring profitablity with different ATR/ADR:Grid Size ratios.

Also, once these results are available for multiple pairs, for risk dispersion, profit maximization and taking advantage of the available leverage I would run the strategy on at least 10 pairs simultaneously, anticipating that the SL-triggering price pattern does not happen at once on multiple pairs.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I'm afraid it may be the opposite. Suppose on the ten pairs, you are mostly based on € and that terrible news happened, Ukraine, election of an anti-Europe party in a major country etc. All your Euro-correlated pairs will be concerned. Same scenario with a majority of pairs connected to the Dollar if you are mainly counter-trend and if all of a sudden it breaks the ceiling. Investing on 10 different simultaneously is a good idea but they must NOT be correlated to each other. And what about gas, gold, oil even HKG33 or JPN225 as an experiment? (I just did 25 pips in about 15 minutes on the French40 this morning)

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I think we are on the same page. Of course, unrelated pairs, commodities and indicies should be the most optimal mix for the portfolio.

On the other hand, a "terrible news" for Euro (or for any other traded currency) would mean instant profit for this strategy (even if they were related), so I don't understand your concern with a sudden market move. There is nothing more favorable for this strategy than a sudden market move (with small retracements)...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I agree because you stand in the other direction, opening H2(...4...8...) after three failures. Inexorably you become on the right trend but do you keep on the same way or reverse after Take Profit? I'm a bit new to this strategy and from what I've seen; there is a reversal of direction at each new position. For instance, first trade you go counter-trend, (id est coming from above you go long etc.) am I wrong? Because assuming a free fall of euro or incredible soaring dollar, it would seem to be common sense to stay in the honey river. Just wondering...

But congratulations to you all, it appears you got "sumthin".

--- 帖子 #487 ---
I concur. Earlier in this thread (as "FxMasterGuru") I have proposed a "modified" version, which would take the next new position (after taking TP) in trend direction, so the strategy would clearly benefit from news related extreme market moves.

Hi all.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
@Kfx
I think this one is very promising, so in your place I would concentrate on "perfecting" this one. At least that is what I am going to do using the mentioned "modified version" (trend direction reentries and keeping original TP).

Also, one more idea: Taking profits and reentering with the same lot size at each grid-step burns up lots of spreads and commissions, which add up. To avoid "feeding the beasts" (i.e. the brokers) excessively repeated reentries, I suggest NOT TO CLOSE the very first trades of each smaller batches, but letting them ride and adding the 2nd and 3rd steps after a 10 pips (grid size) retracement as usual.

It gives the same exact equity gain/loss at each level as the original strategy but without closing and opening trades at each level. Considering a 1.2 pips ECN expense at each grid step, it can mean 12 pips saving on a 100 pip move, which is about 12% cost saving. Not insignificant. Also, as "butterfly effect" happens also in trading, this small, but significant cost saving can mean the difference between being able close a "basket" before a major market turn and before a higher Hedge level would kick in.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Ohhh, I like that modification.

You may want to consider a gap or other coding fix to accommodate spread between the TP and the next entry.  Otherwise, it may hit the retracement grid level before the initial TP is hit and then bounce before TP is hit.

I notice that this has occurred with some of my manual directional grid set-up's where there is substantial whipsawing or where the spread is wider than usual.  In fact, at the beginning of this week's Asian, EUR/NZD underwent a massive wicking event that was some 125 pips in depth.  I had a directional grid set up on the short side.  One TP was hit, but due to slippage and spread, not one, not two, but three sell grid levels were hit before price rapidly retraced back upward by some 100 pips without catching one of those grid levels' limits.

I imagine this type of wide wicking event is rare (and possibly a system problem in this instance), but I can imagine if you set up a grid, for example, for EUR/JPY where there is a grid level to sell at 137.00 with the TP being 136.90 and then a grid level to sell another position right at 136.90, the 136.90 bid price is going to cause your sell order to execute before the ask price matches your TP.  If price does continue down that's great, but what if the ask only dips to 136.91 and then bounces back up.  Well, you've just added to your position at 136.90 without hitting your TP.

I guess one way to solve this is to have the EA not enter another trade until the initial series' TP is hit, but I'm not sure how that would be coded.  I guess you'd have to tell it not to enter a new position until (in the case of a sell) ask is < the TP.

Hi GoldenEA.

Do you use this version which shared earlier or it is a modified version?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi Kfx,Sorry to ask, but I havent seen in your OP what determinate the start of trading the grid....ie. just crossing any gridline?I did play around some in the past in Martingale and grid, and I found that the probability can dramatically raised if the grids starting point a higher probability chart entry.I prefer extremely overbought/oversold areas defined by RSI, on 1H/4H or even daily chart...if all the mentioned timeframes line up then it is Jackpot usually! Rinse and repeat.As someone mentioned above, there is always a chance with martingale for a huge drawdown, but normally the 2-10% a day profit potential makes up for that, even a very short run.Position sizing is a key though, as like your with lvl32 or what was, one already not only run into equity trouble, but also might find that there is no free margin left to open up all the required positions. Time in the trade also crucial, as a large news or weekend gap can result in a mess on the grid distance, and thus a mess of the system.But as one, your system has potentials, albeit a larger risk profile too.

Guys and Gals,

I'm probably not going to make a lot of friends with this post, but I think it needs to be said.

Many on here keep asking for the this and that to be spelled out, or re-written or graphed out so that they can understand it.

This is a complex trading methodology.  It's not something you can just breeze through and get the first time.  Or it's certainly not something I would recommend for novice traders.

Having said that, everything you need to understand is already in the thread.  Just keep going over it.  Now, true, there may be modifications yet to come.  And that's another reason it really isn't fair to ask Paracelus, Kfx, ATA & others to spend a great deal of time trying to dissect every nuance of a system that is still evolving and to re write the explanations and so forth.

I'm sure any of us who have a fairly good idea of what's being done would be more than happy to answer specific questions, but believe me, to go through and spell out every step again and again is very time consuming.

Trade well...

@Kfx

Yes, the concept is easier in theory than in practice, but I think it is possible to replicate the original strategy's concept without going in and out of trades at each grid level and losing spread+commissions during a strong uni-directional move.

Again, just as a brainstorming idea (i.e. not tested) applied to the original (not modified) strategy:

1. In case price runs fast in one direction IMMEDIATELY after the very first trade of each batch ("H1", H2, H4, H8, etc.), I would let these single trades run as far as they go.

2. Sooner or later the price will retrace at least 10 pips from the last touched (i.e. highest or lowest) grid level, when Trade2 is added (as per original strategy). At this point a TP is established for Trade1 and Trade2, which will be exactly at the very last touched grid level.

This way the strategy could save lots of spreads + commissions on "Trade1" positions (in any Hedge batch, incl. "H1") without affecting the profits banked after Trade2 or Trade3 added. Considering 0.4 pips ECN spread + 0.6 pips commission with 10 pips grids, it is a 1 pip, i.e. 10% cost saving, i.e. 10% more profit.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I think I understand.

So in a strong price move in your favor, you keep open only the first trade (of 3) of each grid and let it run until price retraces 10 pips.

If I understand correctly, you still open the same number of trades, but you save commision, spread an slippages with the profit gained with the first trades???

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Yes, that is correct.

As the enclosed screnshot shows (starting with a trend direction "H1/Trade1") the strategy could have saved 10 x spread+commission (not to mention slippages) and still profiting the same gross 110 pips.

"H1/Trade2" was entered after the first 10 pips pullback and TP was issued at the lowest grid level before Trade2 was activated. This method could be applied to each "Trade1" position of each H level, including the initial batch ("H1").

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As mentioned previously, I would favor giving an "extra grid" to TP after Trade2/Trade3 entries, which would have changed the outcome of the above trade as shown below. I need to emphasize that the overall profitablity of these modifications have not been confirmed.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Good example in a very favorable situation .... But

What happen if you close trade2 (+20 pips) and trade3 (+10 pips) and the price retraces to open a new Hedge? ....

Would we be losing the 30 pips that we could have won if we had closed trade1 as usual?.

And in the case of close at 10 pips retrace we only win 20 pips from trade1?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I am not sure if I understood the question well. It it was referring to "giving an extra grid to TP", yes it is risky, and historical analysis needs to be done about it. The question is whether the benefits of waiting for an "extra grid" profit would outweigh the risk of not banking smaller profits and getting stuck in multiple Hedges.

If the questions were referring to closing&opening Trade1 positions at each grid level, I ask you to give a screenshot example and I will try to prove on the same screenshot that the final outcome (i.e. profit) would be the same (except for less costs).

According to my calculations, letting "Trade1" positions "ride" the "trend-waves" would not affect the overall P&L outcome of the strategy. (It would only result in smaller balance increases and smaller equity drawdowns, which would completely neutralize each other.)

So Paracelsus...if I'm reading you right, you're saying (taking my EurUsd for example) I wouldn't close each of those last 3 short entries but would now have one sitting at about 150 pips profit (50 pip grid).  Then if price retraced 50 hit trade 2 with standard TP for both?

Sorry, I cannot comment on it as it would have played out differently for me.

Based on the original strategy (if I understood well) and simply by letting Level1 of each batch run until first retracement it would have given the following scenario for me:

The same thing as above, but by opening each "Level1" in trend direction AND adding one more grid to TP (modified version):

--- 帖子 #516 ---
In my chart I opened and closed trades according your modification.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Checking your chart, you have some mistake ... You open 2 sells in the same level (1.3180) instead open a new one (the third) @1.3190. So Hedge x2 is worng too.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I think with his mod that he's talking about he would have multiple orders at the same level. He took 1st sell then price went down all the way to 1.3160 (assuming price hit that) then retraced 10 pips which initiated his 2nd sell. So now's he's back in standard grid methodology so when price continues against another 10 pips he opens 3rd sell. It just happened to line up with 1st.

EDIT:  Sorry...wrong numbers

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Yes, correct. Taking profits at each 50 pips grid steps and reentering with the same lots in the same direction does not sacrifice too much on spreads and commissions, so for the sake of psychological benefits probably I would rather cash at each level.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Thanks for the clarification, Spyderman.

Just to go over both approaches again:

According to original strategy:
We would have cashed 2 x 10 pips with the Level1 sell trade opened at 1.3180 and at 1.3170.
Then entered Level1 the 3rd time at 1.31600 which had moved eventually against, and adding Level2 at 1.31700 then Level3 at 1.31800.

Final TP at 1.3160.
Total profit: 50 pips.

According to the "ride the wave" approach:
We did not cash on first Level1 trade until both Level2 and Level3 trades reached TP.

Final TP at 1.3160.
Total profit: 50 pips (but saving 2 x commisions+spread).

So the bottom line is that not closing Level1 positions at each grid step DOES NOT change the overall outcome.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
According with your modification, your TP for Hedge x1 is @1.3190, so Level 2 + Level 3 = 50 Pips, and you let the level 1 run.

So, if the price retraces you are not saving commisions or spread because your Level 1 is lossing pips ???

--- 帖子 #522 ---
EDIT: Yes, if price retraces there is a chance of losing pips by "pushing the envelop" and aiming for higher profit.

On the other hand, not considering the higher TP idea, the fact that the strategy DOES NOT CASH IN at each grid level when price moves straight up or down should not reduce the profit, but would save on spreads and commissions (and with very fast moving prices, on slippages).

So the bottom line is letting Level1 running until the first 10 pips grid retracement when Level2 is added and at this moment TP is set at the highest or lowest touched grid level.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
You said before, you just close Level 1 if price retraces 10 pips.

So if we close level 2 and level 3 in TP we win 50 pips and when the price retrace from there we win 0 pips from level 1.

If we do not let the level 1 run and close all in TP we win 60.

So finally we are lossing 10 potential pips.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
@Kfx

Sorry, it must be a misunderstanding. I don't recall mentioning "close Level 1 if price retraces 10 pips". Level1 positions should close according to your original strategy. (Level2 are added when when price retraces 10 pips from highest/lowest grid touch.)

An interesting visual backtest experiment was done with the following slight modifications from August 1st through 8th:

- Extended TP after L2 entries (by 10 pips, i.e. one grid level)

- Entering and re-entering L1 positions in trend direction

- Letting L1 positions ride with a strong market move, i.e. without closing and opening them (to save on spreads and commissions; no effect on final outcome)

FINDINGS:The backtest was started on a Friday (8/1/14), which day has immediately triggered a Hedge4 batch, so it was a good "stress test" for the strategy. Eventually, by the following Friday close (8/8/14), the strategy has grossed about 456 pips (not considering commissions), i.e. 76 pips per day on average. Not bad. Another good news is that the maximum Equity loss was only about -216 pips (thanks to hedging positions). The required max. Hedge level was Hedge16 (it was also the first "Inside Hedge"). If starting the strategy with 1 microlot (0.01 lot), then the max. position size in play would have been 0.84 lots before closing the basket. CONCLUSIONS:The floating Equity loss was minimal, on the other hand the utilized leverage was pretty high. To be able to follow through with max. 0.84 lots in play, the strategy would have required at least a 400 USD account (with 1:400 leverage). The 456 pips gain with 0.01 lot size would have profited 45.60 USD, i.e. approx. 11.4% gross profit on a 400 USD account within one week.

Paracelsus, please tell me what are the posts number talking about you modification I must choose.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
@Kfx

Yes, that is fine with me.

Nevertheless, I need to emphasize that all the mentioned "modifications" are based on my own theories and limited visual backtests.The description of the "trend direction first entry/basket re-entry" and the "extended TP" were mentioned in post #367. The idea about letting L1 positions run - without closing and reopening them - during a strong market move was mentioned in post #492; the visual demonstration of it was shown in post #512.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
no problem.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Done.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Can anybody else test this EA with MT4 build 670?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
The EA works good for me with build 670, but I get some errors in the journal backtest. (redundant modification, OrderModify error 1 ... )

--- 帖子 #537 ---
An update on continuation of the visual backtest for August with the previously mentioned slight modifications (trend direction first entry/re-entry and extended TP).

I have also included a 200 EMA on the charts, confirming that the first trade on 8/11/14 (Monday) was a "justified" BUY (as price was above EMA).

The week of August 11-15 brought sideway movements on EUR/USD with minor fluctuations, so the strategy could not profit from it; it just carried over the H1 and H2 positions from Monday through Friday. Totally "normal" and expected during a sideway moving week.

Hi Kfx!!

First I want to thank you share with all of us this interesting system.

Then I have tried to install indicators and systems that attach in this thread on my platform and still have not managed it.Could you tell us in folders to install indicators and systems that we attached?

Thank you and I hope to collaborate with you in this interesting thread

Can anybody upload the .ex4 file?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
sorry, I am Spanish and my English is not very good ... now I'm testing the EA mghEAv1.0 currently results in several pairs are:

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Clip...g-gold/1007533

you can see that while the profit on going up, down or stays approximately equitidad in the initial price, and DD increases. This is because we are leaving without closing operations such as in eurjpy, several BUYx2 with TP 137.18 and SELLx4 with TP 136.64.

Let's see if just closing ... or reaching maximum DD ...

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Today 215 Pips ?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Don't use this EA on real account. It will blow your acc, sooner or later.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
yes, but if you look equitity curve, this has dropped today.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Thanks, yes, I know, I'm only in demo to check the operation, although I think the system is very interesting and with a few tweaks or improvements in the output of the trades to avoid many lost accumulated enough to prove the real-acount.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
now 246 pips

--- 帖子 #546 ---
What's everyone's thoughts on lot sizing.  I usually base mine on my stoploss distance which of course isn't in play here.

Ultimately I suppose it should just be some factor of account size.

I'm interested to see other ideas.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi everyone, i download the last version EA, but it doesn't compile in MT4...how can i backtest it?

Thanks you very much

--- 帖子 #548 ---
You are not the only one. It is my problem, too. I also asked anybody to upload an ex4 file of the EA... or any other help, please!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
All that EA's dont work properly as it was described in first posts. It do not closes  loosing orders when inside grids are taking profit. Also have many another issues. Or i passed working version ?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Muy buenas Clipi!!

Has conseguido instalar el archivo Grid v2?En que carpeta lo has instalado.....si es que lo has conseguido!!

Un saludo

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Here is the .ex4 my friends ...

Hi kfx

i opened an account in forexfactory in order to share with you in this thread ..

So please , what is the expert advisor that you are working with it right now ?!

Good luck (y)

--- 帖子 #556 ---
To all ...

Be careful with your Real accounts, I do not recomend use this system yet because is in developement process already ... But if you can not wait and want to test it, use lots as small as possible and close all your possitions if you reach some drawdown equity percent, for example 20% or 30%..

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Yes, SL should be definitely based on account size and measured in percentage AND also adjusted to the max. Hedge-multipliers allowed.

For me the optimal SL would be around 5%, however, with smaller accounts I might go for 10%.

Concerning Hedge, I would go for max. Hedge x 16, or as an extreme, up to Hedge x 32, but in this latter case one would need a significantly larger margin to accommodate up to 1.68 lots(!) in play with a 0.01 lot Level1 start. Naturally such a margin increase would automatically reduce the profit percentages, which should be also considered.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hi baidovich!

I'm not working with EA's yet, just trying to improve the system.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thank you very much, KfX! It is working now on backtest, so my problem is solved!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
With ex4 file which was upload by KfX, my problem is solved.

MT4 (B670) wasn't able to open this mq4 file.

(I load the OrderSendReliable into Includes directory, of course.)

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Can someone make a small modification of the MGHEAv2.0? only change de hedge multiplier, where hedge x3, hedege x9, hedge x27, hedgex 81 ... (0.01, 0.03, 0.09, 0.27, 0.81, 2.43)
think would have accumulated more profit than loss trades, could then manually shut down operations pending losses and would have global benefits.

very thanks!

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Is this thread is dead or people still finding the way of strategy ?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
i think that the thread is dead..

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi Clipi!

i'm to try this system in manual mode and demo.But the automatic system i couldn't to go in mt4.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I've been testing the EA with some small modification, and in two days starts accumulating losses to total ruin. It expands to hedgex2 hedgex4 hedgex8 without ever closing the overall operations.

think we need to find out a method to not accumulate many operations, I guess manually will be easier to make the overall closed.

sorry for my bad English

--- 帖子 #566 ---
@Clipi

Could you please give me the start date when the strategy has started accumulating losses leading to total ruin?

I would like to test these days with my "modified" strategy" (mentioned by the author in Post No.1). I will post screenshots of my visual backtest.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I like the concept and was also wondering if people were trading it manually as well as with EA.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
this link is the first test, I used x3 multiplier. (0.01lots, 0.03lots,0.09lolt, 0.27 lots..)

for example, buy EU 1.2930, next buy in 12920, TP set 3 pips above initial buy (1.2933)

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Clipi/hedgex3/1012898

In this link, its de second test, TP set 10 pips above initial buy and multiplier x 3

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Clip...-daily/1014908

I think it's better multiplier by 3, so when the price goes against 3 executed, we lose nothing and we are in balance.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
As far as I know, the EA does not follow the exact rules of the system.

On the other hand, I think you are taking too much risk in your $500 demo accounts working with 0.01 lots and many pairs, multiples x3.

I would assign $1.000 and 0.01 lots per pair and I will close all trades on about 20% drawdown, thinking in the oiginal system rules backtest.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi

This is my results, start from 21.08.2014 until today.

EUR/USD 20 pips grid, full manual trading.

I know the lot size is too big but wanted to try a risky strategy (quick profit or quick death).

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Hi, Anyone still continue to test, improve or optimize this strategy?

Let it die, a little pity.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi Kfx,

Thanks for this idea. I've developed a small ea for the 1st and 2nd set. I don't know I've understand it correctly. can you check it.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hi

I'm still working in improve MGH and in new ideas ....

We may be making changes daily, implementing multicolor indicators, or changing the rules again and again to this thread still alive but I think the goal was to give some concepts and ideas for open minds and people who work in it, so let's work, and if you have any really worthwhile idea, just post here.

Best regards.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi,

Thanks for your reply. I can't upload the source. So, Here I've copied it. Maybe as a junior member, I don't have permission to upload. Please copy and paste this. I've found one error. X2 begins without the grid size formula (10 pips below / above). I don't know how to correct it. I'm having little problems in pending orders.

Please go through it. It's just the beginning of code. So, Yet, I didn't close all and percentage loss routines.

Thanks.

Bendz, Thank you for your contribution. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with programming, but very concerned about this strategy. Very much hope programming experts to help review.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hello yczzd,

Thanks. This strategy is useful exit without loss, if we close the first set and other sets when we get a little profit. Again, we can begin from the 1st set. I hope, we can use this method with a limited account balance.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
so simple.. good stuff

Benzd, thank you for your work!

It would be wonderful to get an EA which is able to work the same exact mode that this MGH startegy has written.

Hi moncsicsi,

Hi Kfx!

I sending a screenshot and operations as I understand them.Are they correct?

I hope to be able to send you another screenshot when the market is complicated and that is where I me complicated.

When I have 3 trades from 0.1 lots and not going in the direction I want I give 100pips of margin and if you play it at the next level of 100pips is when I open a trade of 0.2 lots.Is it so?

In the event that it closes arriving at 100pips still opening operations in the same direction or touching the 100pips open operation in the opposite direction?

I hope to finally understand the philosophy of the system and to be able to help in this forum.

Thank you and good trading all

Hi KFX,

Thanks for your reply. Golden EA code is good. But your main concept of 00 level orders is an important role in this system. If we can implement limit / pending orders, the system must be a good one.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi moncsicsi,

Thanks for your reply. I'm trying to fix the bug. Soon I'll send the code.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I don't think that using 00 levels would have any major positive impact on the strategy. On the contrary: I can only think of a potential negative impact. If it turns out to be a consistently profitable strategy and everybody would enter/exit at 00 levels, the competing accounts would "kill" each other by causing significant slippage.

It is not a far fetched idea as I am running a successful strategy (see perforamance graph on my bio page) which already starts to suffer from its own success as more and more accounts are fighting for the same entry and exit prices. When brokers notice a sudden influx of large number of orders, they move bid/ask fast in the same direction and/or widen spreads.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hi Paracelsus,

Thanks for your suggestion. I think you may be correct. Then we don't need to worry about 00 in ea.

I can't see the performance graph. What's your choice in pairs for this system? instead of eur/usd?

if you've got any idea please post.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Due to the best spread I would definitely go with EURUSD first, however, any other pairs with reasonable and regular breakout patterns should be just fine.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
MGH Beta test in progress as per my modifications (endorsed by Author Kfx in Post #1).

Looking good...! There was no need for hedging so far (strategy is set to go to max. Hedge 16).

Below charts shows 15 closed trades (all profitable) with 18.69 EUR banked profit and 3 open trades with 1.95 EUR floating profit within 24 hours and with 0.01 lot size start. (This is a live ECN account showing 0.05 Euros commissions for each 0.01 lot traded.)

EA results are only for demonstration purposes, EA is not for share or sale.

EMA 200 on 1H chart was used for initial and re-reentry directions. "Sell" if price below EMA and "Buy" if price above MA.

Very nice charts Pacacelsus.

It would be interesting to see how the EA performs in fast market movements or at news time.

Very good idea the MA implementation, by the way.

Hi all.

Here is a visual backtest of the system but with many modifications, of almost 1 year. Results are net pips (subtracting commissions) and with no MM.

I still seeing a lot of potential in this concept, but it requires hard work and a lot of testing. My mate is now working on a robot for JForex platform, hopefully soon be finished to speed up the testing task.

Hi Paracelsus,

You've got good results. It's a really nice idea Using ema as an another confirmation for entry. Keep it up.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
MGH strategy can be adjusted many ways, so it will not be easy to find the best parameters for the "best" results, especially that "best" is a very subjective term. For me "best" means safest with a decent profit return.

Short term-optimization might help, especially that the strategy parameters should be adjusted to the ever-changing market conditions. In other words long-term backtesting and long-term optimization (with the same parameters) might be counterproductive.

My beta live forward test has the following parameters:

Grid step: 10 pips (as per original strategy).
Levels in each batch: 3 (as per original strategy)
Max. batches: 5
Potential profits in Batch1: 10 or 30 or 60 pips. (as per modified strategy)
Basket Profit: 60 pips (modified), i.e. 0.6% on a 1k account.
(Once a Hedge2 trade is opened, the strategy switches to "Basket Mode", i.e. calculating profits for the entire basket, incl. closed and floating P&L.)
Stop Loss: -2000 pips (which is about 20% of a 1k account).

Hi Paracelsus,

Just an update on today's events: EA has entered Batch2 BUYS (0.02 lots) x 3, then as price moved back down it has closed Intitial Batch (3 sells with 0.01 lot) at TP then opened Batch3 (0.04 lots x 2) as of now.

As seen in the left upper corner:
BUY: Batch2
SELL: Batch3

Hi Paracelsus,

Superb. Expecting final result.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Here are the updated results:

Currently in play: Batch3 in SELL (0.04 lots) x 3 and Batch4 in BUY (0.08 lots) x 3. In other words price is stuck between Batch3 and Batch4, which can last even for more than a week when the market is not trending. So no surprise here.

Basket TP will be reached when the market makes a decisive move into one direction (does not matter in which, but "preferably" up in this case (as we have more lots invested in Batch4 "buy" positions). The other - but slower - way to reach Basket TP would be that the market makes multiple 40-50 pips ranging moves either in the zone of Batch3 or Batch4 (preferably at Batch4 with the larger lot sizes).

Basket P&L: -46 Euros (as of 9/24/14 AM), which is about -60 USD, ie. -6% on a 1k account. At Batch4 level -6% is still pretty good.

Here is the performance analysis of the current forward test (100% Profitability, ie. 100:0 W:L ratio looks good):

The problem is when inside grid will be opened and price reverse again. In that way we can get one more gap. Like on the screenshot below.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Paracelsus, have you thought of using the EA in any other pair? GBPUSD?

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Yes, however, it is just the "Maiden Voyage", i.e. live forward test of the EA. Still not sure if we get some bugs...

More volatile and trending markets would be probably better. Any particular suggestions?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Inside grid is activated only when inside gap is at least 50 pips wide and price retraces in the gap by more than half of the gap's size (currently gap is about 70 pips). When inside hedge opens, then inside gap shrinks to half of its original size automatically.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I have my EA that works on MGH strategy from this thread. Yes, when gap is big we open inside grid. Imagine that we fully opened 3 insidegrid opsitions and price have reversed ( read " 3 iside grid positions didnt hit TP ). So now we could have 6 positions in one direction while price goes to another. I met it many times and in this case i have problem with multiplier because i increase lot on inside grid as well. And when hedge multiplier is HEDGE128 we have some problems.

I curious did you get it in your test and if yes, how you found a decision to fix it ? Hope you understand what i mean. If no i can make some screenshots.

thanks.

I made a lot of backtest with this EA, on EURJPY, CADJPY pairs (so on trending pairs), but every test are quite poor...

paracelso can put your setup?

My EA is doing a little crazy ...

I am using a privately made MGH EA, so the parameters of mine would be irrelevant.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Consequently your results are irrelevant, too (nobody can reproduce them).

Can anyody build a good EA for this strategy?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
it works a little better than the original, good changes, seems to work well.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I made EA that works on this strategy, but results are the same always is stop-out because of GAP between the baskets. While we shrink gap first time we get some DD and then we can get one more gap and inside grid could be hanged as well. I may upload beta version but it the strategy is wrong in that representation from the first page of this thread.

--- 帖子 #624 ---

Take a look at that DD and size of GAPs. I am using 2 pips between positions, but it is just for test to see how it is going. If increase step between positions it is do not change the situation.

I understand you, but would you upload your EA?

Thanks to you for deleting your previous post.

I addressed my question (for sharing EA) to vadimizumov.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
The EA follows the "Rules" with slight modifications approved by Author Kfx (see Post No.1), so the EA's results are as relevant as of the original strategy's.

Screenshots are uploaded daily, so the concept can be easily followed.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Sorry, Vazze...  I thought it was addressed to me...

--- 帖子 #630 ---
This EA is not fully completed yet. I used old "2sides" EA and modified to the MGH EA.

Profit - is a profit in % from balance to close all orders.

UseMoney is how much EA will use money to calculate starting lot. Try to increase this option if EA says "not enough money".

NEVER USE THIS EA FOR REAL MONEY !

Advanced statistics are looking good:

--- 帖子 #632 ---
During the past week I have noticed that when a new Hedge group starts, the FIRST trade of the new hedge group cannot completely hedge 3 opposite direction trades, so the EA cannot take advantage of a very strong move. In other words: the floating DD will increase until the second hedge position has been opened.

For example: if we have 3 x 0.02 BUY lots and the trend turns suddenly downwards with a vertical drop, the EA will take 10 pips profits on multiple 1 x 0.04 SELL lots while losing more on the 3 x 0.02 BUY lots.

So the FIRST hedge is only a partial hedge, increasing the floating DD with a strong unidirectional move.

The solution might be opening new hedge groups by using a 3x multiplier. In this case the FIRST hedge position would FULLY compensate for the opposite direction trades and TP would be reached sooner. Of course, there is a downside: the lot increase would be much faster, too.

Visual summary of the past week:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #633 ---
On 9/29/2014 AM (7th trading day), the EA has closed the Basket with 30 Euros profit. Total profit for the past 7 days was 40 Euros (a significant amount of profit was spent on swaps). Further forward tests have been suspended until after the full effect of the above-mentioned 3x multiplier has been analyzed.

Here is the final screenshot of the series:

In the first test performing at MGH v2.0, arrives at the same conclusion.

Modify EA to x3. retest and also died within a few days.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Well, if strategy dies consistently, the whole thing could be reversed for a consistently profitable strategy.

(Of course, a lot depends on SL and TP settings.)

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Is this post dead? Where is Paracelsus? Are there anyone still use this method?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
If follow strategy from first post i consider that this strategy is wrong. I fully complete to code EA which is following MGH and there are always is a margin call. I try t change many parameters and options such as distance between openings, multipliers, TPs, SLs  etc . result is the same. Strategy fully unprofitable. Now i coding EA which is works on modified MGH system. And results is much better. Now i at the finish of coding EA just catching number of bugs. And share the results.

Hi vadimizumov,

Nice to hear about it. I'm interesting to see your results. Expecting good results.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I am still working on my EA version. The problem is that when I restart MT4 (with my weekly VPS maintenance restarts) the EA "forgets" where it was in the chain of trades and restarts itself from Batch1/Trade1... Not good...

Since "MT4 restarts" can happen at anytime, my EA is unreliable THIS WAY, so I am stuck. I will not even do backtests with it if I may not be able to use it on large live accounts safely.

Should anyone have an idea how to make an EA to "remember" its trade sequence after a restart, please PM me.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Great Job

--- 帖子 #642 ---
I agree with you, but you have to consider this thread like a trading idea or concept, not like a strategie itself ... Of course that's the main idea, and you and others are working on it to improve it and make it something profitable.

Since I started this thread I have been working hard to get something intresting and I think Im the right way. The idea still working for me but have made a lot of tweaks and I currently using as a recovery system.

Working with a mate coder and a forum member we have a get finally a nice EA. This is a 2 year 99.9% DukasCopy tick data backtest (commisions and spread included) results so far. I hope soon start the fordward test in a small Live account, because good backtest and past results do not guarantee good future results, but only to create a path, to creating our systems.

http://oi59.tinypic.com/10z1l6a.jpg

Hi Paracelsus!

You can use a external .txt file to save the level info or something.

http://docs.mql4.com/files/filewrite

One of the problems is when some positions close between the restart ... In this case you have to write the .txt manually before run the EA again.

Greetings and many pips to all.

hi Kfx, are u using Dukascopy now? There is some difference between Dukas and other broker in Hedge action.

For example, after close profit order in hedge, the account equity do not increase. And the used margin not equal buy order+sell order.

And another question, you create a JAVA version of MGH_v2.mql ?

Hi all !!!!.

I hope that everyone trade well.

I am still testing a modified version but manually and sometimes especially during the news is very hard to trade properly.

I was thinking if someone could share the modified EA (Paracelsus version).

I have no idea how to modify the original EA so if anyone can share I'll be very grateful.

All best to all!!!

Kaczucha11,

your suggestion seems to be no response.

I am very concerned about this post, and tried to make it don't sink. At the same time, has also suggested that people can share his EA, so that  jointly test the trading strategy. Doing so at least the following benefits:

1. Can quickly verify the reliability of EA, and improve.

2. Better to verify the effectiveness of the method.

3. If  this way to complete the EA, can let the world traders common benefit.

Perhaps it is reason of the third point, do not want to share.

Very sorry.

Hi Paracelsus,

Have you been researching the 3x multiplier? It seems to me that it could potentially increase lot size too quickly to keep the system within profitable limits and risk tolerance. Although the drawdown is not pleasant during the trends, it may be more acceptable than the rapid increase in lot size. More testing is needed here.

I found some bugs in the EA on the OP, so I'm tweaking the inside trade functionality as well as some other additions. I've added your mods as well and would like to trade the strategy as you do with the same risk profile.

@Kfx

Thanks for sharing your ideas. I'm curious as to what additions you have made to your "work in progress" as per your original post that you have found helpful thus far. Would you give a summary of those changes?

Glen

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Yes, I agree. 3x multiplier is too steep.

My EA had some bugs which have been corrected since, and on October 22nd I have started a new forward test with a few tweaks:

1. I use only 2-step grid instead of 3. The reason: this way the DD is smaller with the unavoidable and expected counter trend moves.

2. I have increased lot multiplier from 2x to 2.5x. The reason: a sudden "vertical" counter-move of the market will produce instant profits and faster reach of global TP (60 pips per basket). With the original setup (i.e. 3-step grid with 2x multiplier) a sudden "vertical" counter-move has created instant losses.

3. No "inside hedge" is used. The reason: it may create situations with too large floating DD. Although the profit will come later this way, it seems to be a safer approach, and with any Grid/Martingale strategy safety is key issue.

Which way you close reds ?

--- 帖子 #657 ---
As shown on the screenshot: "reds" have closed when the COMBINED PROFIT of open Batch1 "reds" and open and closed  Batch2 "blues", i.e. the Basket has reached +60 pips total profit. Due to positive slippage this specific basket has closed at +72 pips total profit. After that the EA has reset, starting with a new Batch1 "sell" again in the direction of the current trend (validated by 1-hour 200EMA).

<p>
These are great additions, especially the 2 levels and the removal of the inside hedge.

So your lot progression is as follows:

H1: 0.10

H2: 0.25

H3: 0.63

H4: 1.56

H5: 3.91

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hi,

It's really a very good idea to close the basket with minimum profit. Nice work. Keep it up.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Yes thats the easyest way. After price goes back and your 2.5x you must open 2.5*2.5x hedge. And after the last ones will hang up you will be in trouble. I just thought you use special SL point.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Yes, with minor rounding: 0.1   0.25   0.6   1.5   3.75

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Correct. EA has a "Global SL" function. Probably I will set it at -15% for this forward test, as with a 1% average daily profit it should be tolerable.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Paracelsus,

For clarification: What are you referring to as a 2 step vs 3 step grid and "inside" hedge ?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Original strategy by Kfx uses max. 3-level (i.e. "3-grid" or "3-step grid") entries in one direction. In other words - at a given time - there may be max. 3 buy and max. 3 sell positions in play. In my EXPERIMENTAL version I have reduced the max. entries to max. 2 levels in each direction, so at any given time time there may be max. 2 x 2 positions open on the chart. As stated previously it helps to reduce market exposure and it also reduces the "stress" placed on hedging batches to compensate and overcome the floating DD.
____________________________

INSIDE GRID (= "Inside Hedge") is also part of the original strategy by Kfx. After initial "Batch1" entries have been maxed out and the market turns against Batch1, then all the subsequent new Batches serve as "Hedging" batches. For example: Batch2 hedges Batch1 positions AND tries to close the Basket (created by Batch1 and Batch2) in profit. Once Batch1 is closed, Batch3 is opened simultaneously which hedges Batch2 AND tries to close the Basket in profit. And so on.

There may be occasions when the distance between Batch1 and Batch2 (or Batch2 and Batch3, or Batch3 and Batch4, etc) is just too wide, which large distance hinders the strategy's ability to close the actual Basket in profit. Why? The price HAS TO break out of the range created by the upper and lower batches to get a chance for profitable Basket closure. For example: if the distance is 200-300 pips, one might need to wait even WEEKS for a breakout. This is why Kfx has created INSIDE GRID (or "Inside Hedge").

INSIDE GRID means that once the distance between the upper and lower batches is too large, the strategy starts the next Batch BETWEEN the current upper and lower batches (i.e. not at the upper or lower edges).

Initially it was a very attractive solution for the problem, but as Vadimizumov has pointed out very well (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...70#post7759470) it carries significant risk when the market turns around immediately after maxing out the "INSIDE GRID batch". Since it carries the high risk of a major DD (after a sudden turnaround of the market), I had no choice but to eliminate INSIDE GRID ("Inside hedge") from my EA.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Over the weekend I had to make some adjustments within the Parameters to reduce (hopefully eliminate) the need of an "Inside Grid" (or "Inside Hedge").

My beta live forward test has the following parameters:

Grid step: 10 pips (as per original strategy).
Max. entry Levels/Grids in one direction: 2 (modified from original 3)
Max. batches: 5 (limited)

Potential Profit Targets within Batch1: +20 pips (if profit is achieved with the 1st level of Batch1) or +50 pips (if Batch1 profit comes with the 1st and 2nd levels of Batch1 as 20 + 30 pips).

Basket Profit Target: +5 USD (modified). Once a "Batch2" or "Hedge2" trade is opened, the strategy switches to "Basket Mode", i.e. calculating profits for the entire basket, incl. closed profits and floating P&L.

Stop Loss: -2000 pips (which is about 20% of a 10k account).

Since these "tweaked" parameters will change the R/R of the strategy, I have restarted the EA (and the Beta forward test) on a "clean" account as of October 26th, 2014: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Para...oq4ccYmGnHTmBv

Expected Profit:............. 7-10% per month (with 0.1 initial lot size on a 10k account)
Anticipated Max. DD:....... -15%
Anticipated Max. SL:........ -20%

(Of course, the R/R could be better, but it is pretty good for a Martingale/Grid strategy.)

Thank you for the explanation and information Paracelsus.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
You are welcome! Although I am not the inventor of this strategy (it is Kfx), please feel free to contact me here or via PM with any questions.

I understood and I like the logic of this strategy very much, as it does not need any "prediction" where the market will move next. IT DOES NOT MATTER!
This strategy can be successful without foreseing the next move of the market. (Even if it moves 250 pips in one day, like on October 15th, 2014.)

Thanks for sharing, Kfx!

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Here is the first snapshot for 10/27/2014.

The strategy is already in "Basket Mode"as seen in the left upper corner. It means that the most likely (and planned) outcome of this Basket is closure at +5 USD. Next "buy" or "sell" entries will happen at marked "Target" lines, although if price moves up, Batch2 will create enough profit to close the Basket even before reaching marked upper TP.

Basket TP may sound "too modest", but it had to be reduced to be able to escape from "Basket Mode" as soon as possible. The reasons: 1. The real profits come from Batch1 trades (i.e. when there is no Batch2 yet). 2. The longer the strategy stays in Basket Mode, the higher the chance of running into a major and potentially devastating DD. So getting out of the Basket ASAP (with a small profit at least) is the safest approach, as SAFETY FIRST & PROFITS AFTER.

Parcelus good work, I always thought that this martingale could be made to work, the issue is to get out alive when there is much distance between batch, it looks like you got it. Good work and good EA.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hi Paracelsus

I like your idea.

Could you post your V5 version and your set ?

Thx.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
As mentioned before, I am glad to share the ideas, principles and settings the EA uses, but it is not for share or sale. One main reason is that I am not a programmer and although the EA is based on the strategy presented by Kfx and the algorithm was made by me, the programmer has the Copyright to the EA. Thanks for the understanding.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Correct. The occasional large distance between the upper and lower batches was a major challenge to overcome and the only solution was reducing Basket TP to get out of the baskets ASAP, which would RESET the EA.

So basically the main source of the profit of the current setup is originated from Batch1 (+20 pips or +50 pips). Once hedging starts with Batch2 (i.e. the start of "Basket Mode") the main goal is not the profit any longer, but to GET OUT of the basket as soon as possible.

There are plenty of opportunities when Batch1 can produce nice profits, so it is OK to concentrate on AVOIDING large baskets (and large DD) by limiting Basket TP.

As the current snapshot shows the EA is in its second (Batch1 + Batch 2) Basket for the day and the expected outcome is another +5 USD profit.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Excellent idea on the implementation of a trade rescue and a with a small profit (added bonus). Theoretically this will eliminate the "danglers" of the trades at the extreme highs and lows and keep the baskets and capital from getting too high. It stops large drawdowns but I wonder how it will affect the long term profitability of the system. Where would you look for the next trade levels to start a new basket ?

Pre- set levels where the EA would initiate the trade or does the EA close the basket and allow the trader to evaluate the market before starting a new basket ? In cases of extreme news or large price movement.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
The reduction of the Basket TP has significantly cut back on the profitability of the strategy, but there is no other way to play it safe.

Once a basket is closed, the first Batch1 position is opened in relation to the 1-hr 200EMA. If the acutal price is below the EMA, the EA opens a "sell", if above, it opens a "buy" trade.

Hi Bendz!

What's about your EA?

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Paracelsus, what was the reason for going to a $20 vs $10 profit target that you had back in post 660 ? A 10 point move would hit more frequently than a 20 point move. Less profit but higher % of probability.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
I have run a few backtests and the 20 pips TP was the most profitable setting without increasing the risk of "getting stuck".

Also, by this change the max. achievable profit from Batch1 has not changed much: with a 3-level entry and 10 pips TP it was 10+20+30 (total 60) pips and with the new 2-level entry and 20 pips TP it has become 20+30 (total 50) pips.

In addition, using 20 pips TP saves the EA from new entries triggered by occasional fake breakouts.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
20 points on entries between trades as well as profit target or just profit targets ?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
TP is 20 pips for 1st trade and 30 pips for the 2nd trade of each Batch, as the distance between the two entry levels is 10 pips.

TP level is at the same price level for both trades of each Batch.

Snapshot for 10/28/2014:

Paracelsus,

Why did you buy at .65 lots after the 2 .10 lot buys before it ?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Batch1: 0.1 lot BUY
Batch2: 0.25 lot SELL
Batch3: 0.65 lot BUY

After entering Batch2 SELL, price has moved up, so Batch1 was closed at preset TP level, and Batch3 has been opened immediately with 0.65 lot, practically replacing Batch1 with higher lot numbers, to hedge for 0.25 lot Batch2 positions.
________________________

New snapshot for 10/28/14. Since Monday 2 baskets have been closed each with 5 USD TP. After most recent basket close, the EA has reset itself and opened two "buy" Batch1 positions. Each basket is highlighted separately.

Snapshot for 10/29/14 AM:

As seen on the screenshot the strategy in a "waiting mode". The beauty of the strategy is that it idoes not matter in which direction the market will break out ofthe 60 pips "waiting room", it will emerge as a winner.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #685 ---
We got the breakout from the original "waiting room" to the upside. The 5 USD "Basket TP" is expected on the upside after the most recent Batch3/Trade2 retracement entry. It should happen before the upper "Batch TP" level is reached. Otherwise a new 80 pips wide "waiting room" has been created.

I have not seen any better (safer) combo of Grid, Hedge and Martingale elements within one strategy, so I hope to see some more good results, too.

Most credits should go to Kfx who has come up with the basic concept.

Hello to All , I am new in here since yesterday and I read every post from the first one to the last.

What was once a good solid initiative from Kfx and had good evolution in the thread by people helping on this project has now degraded to sneaky hidden actions by ego's. Its no longer a group who's members are helping out each other. This thread, as it was, is dead.

Someone has taken over this thread instead of helping a hand with what he/she is capable of. We all have different qualities and being a coder is only one of many. Shame on you Paracelcus for not sharing the fruition that you could only make thanks to the idea's and work of Kfx and many others.

Every basket has many good apples . . .

Congrats and many thanks to Kfx with the idea and thanks to all others who helped along the way. I was interested and would have given my own logic and logical reasoning to this thread too, but its dead as it was once working so nice.

Happy trading to all good spirits,

Cheers

Absolutely untrue and I couldn't disagree with you more. You said yourself that,
How do you know this isn't true for Paracelsus also? Paracelsus is under no obligation to share his EA, whether he coded it himself or paid to have it done. He has added valuable ideas to this thread and has been clear from the start in sharing his ideas and how they are implemented.

You have all the tools to create your own EA or have someone do it for you. This is not unfair nor unreasonable.

No doubt.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Sorry, if it has come down to feeling "spoon fed". It was not my intention.

Unfortunately Kfx's original strategy was not viable on the long term. Even he has admitted it and he has not posted any longer since then. I have just made a version of his strategy which seems to viable. As nobody else has done the same and as brainstorming has stopped.

Should my posts hurt FF members, I will stop posting and let the thread die. Literally.

P.S. The EA is copyright protected by the programmer I had paid. By the way: based on the info in this thread anybody could rebuild the same exact EA with the same exact parameters settings. EVERYTHING IS IN THIS THREAD.

@madscalp

I have made it clear even before post 643 that the EA is not for sale or share. I still respect intellectual property, i.e. COPYRIGHT.

I guess you are here only for the freebees. Everybody else should spend hours and weeks figuring out a profitable strategy and spend their money on it. Right..?

Once everything is ready, you just show up and "gracefully" demand it for FREE... By the way what have YOU contributed to this thread...?

Ohh... Almost forgot it: "You don't want to share..."

--- 帖子 #701 ---
@Paracelcus

just being curious now: why don't you start your own thread then? you refer grateful to Kfx for his source idea you thank all other helpers that got you to where your light-bulb went on you state in your 1st post that you will make an EA but will not share it (or is that against the FF rules?) Really, just wondering.

It would be a more honest way to do what you're doing. And that way everyone could ask you questions and give their opinions etc..etc..until we all understand what your view is on your type EA (albeit based on the idea of Kfx ea)

If your ea is so different from the initial idea in this thread, what are you doing here then? Really.

It is confusing you know!

Of course I wish everyone good trades but I wanna see the ideas from Kfx evolve further and maybe put my 2 cents in there too (if I can). This has become impossible because the thread has changed and taken over by you. (FF rules?)

I really wish you the very best .. in your thread !

To me the discussion is closed.

Happy trades to all.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Do you have a summary or overview of the total process?

--- 帖子 #703 ---
If I had started a new thread I would have been accused of stealing Kfx's idea. My modifications were minor compared to his basic idea, so it sounded a better idea to publish the modified version (and its live results) here.

After reading so many accusations and discontent, I bid farewell to this thread. Should anybody interested in the future of the modified version can follow it via the previously posted MyFyBook link. Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
In Post No.1 Kfx has very thoroughly detailed all the main elements of his strategy. My modifications were very minor, but in their effects they were substantial:

1. First trades were opened always in trend direction (depending on price from 1H 200EMA).
2. Grid levels were reduced from 3 to 2 in each direction.
2. Lot multiplier has been increased from 2 to 2.5.
3. Basket TP was reduced to 5 USD (with 0.1 lot start).

I am also curious to see well this thread will evolve from here.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
@Paracelsus, Thanks for your new ideas and researches posted in the thread.

This has helped me and also wanted to make my contribution and post a free EA.

Now I have no chance to learn something new because you will no longer post. The great master has nothing posted in forum since April, and has no new ideas to post in the future for us. Pity ...

Hi, SwingMan

I don't want this thread die.

In fact, I several times in the past to awaken it, after it sank.

Although my English is poor, but with the help of Google translation, I still work very hard to learn this thread. Because I feel that this strategy is promising.

In front of my once called on a people can share a EA for someone testing, because of the absence of a newly developed EA is perfect, after a long time to test, modify, and test again, to gradually perfect.

Since the people do not want to share, we respect their rights and freedom. Just, you use the running situation of EA and discussion with everyone in here, is of no significance, it is not fair, because we are not on the same platform, will not be able to get the same feeling and reach a consensus.

I still hope, a programming, loving, noble, respected Master can share his EA.

Hi all.

No problem if Paracelus want to post their results here.

About the "share" controversy, I will not enter.

Guys, read this thread carefully, try to understand the concept, study it well and adapt it to your own system. I guarantee you that with effort you will create a very robust system like the one I now have.

So we got 5 "YES" and zero "NO" votes, which means that I am going to post the live forward test results and ignore those who accuse me of "hijacking" this thread.

As a side note: I am not trying to be the "sharpest knife in the drawer", but wanted to show that with conservative settings and with patience it is possible to limit the DD and still gain some decent profits by using "Martingale, Grid & Hedge".

If anyone has some ideas how to make this strategy safer and more profitable, please speak up.

So after some tests the lot size multiple works well , but if we set the EA to open only 2 positions in one direction (maxlevel) then EA for some reason does not open hedge x2. I hope it's not big problem to sort out.

Hello,

i think this EA has great potential!!!

After some Backtest's i have had the following Idea:

is it possible to Close All open Orders after this?

if ( Profit[All] > (OpenProfit+50) )

closeAllOrders();

So after this Profit (50) the EA should close All open Orders and he can restart New.

I hope someone can do that for me?

Another nice day. Already 1.72% for the week and the EA is in Batch1 with floating profits.

Total profit +5.57% for the past 7 trading days, i.e. 0.8% per day. Which is not bad. My local bank gives that much for a year...

Please disregard the EMA on this chart, as for the better visibility I have switched the chart to M15. On H1 the EMA200 still indicates a downtrend, which is why each new Batch1 had been opened as SELL.

Hi

Love the idea, was previously looking into this. Glad its working for some.

Just a quick question, at what point do you cut a loss on a trade? after level 4, what if its in a severely strong trend. I appreciate that the opposite trades will be winning, but all 4 open positions on the wrong side would be deep in the red. Cause quite an issue.

Apologies if I have missed that and this has already been discussed.

Thanks,

Oz

--- 帖子 #748 ---
This is the question. I made many tests on different pairs. I were using inside grids i were trying all possible combinations but result was the same. I woud think this strategy is unprofitable.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
My "modified version" can go for Batch5, although in backtests it was not needed. Nevertheless, Batch5 floating DD can reach -35% (0.1 lot/10k).

In my opinion the strategy and the parameters should be designed so (and it was my goal) that it should not capitulate. The reason: you need to allow at least 4 Batches ("Hedges") to make it profitable, however, if you are in the 5th Batch (Hedge) your floating DD is so significant, that the recovery time is simply too long. So the only solution is to "keep on running" and to build a safe path for the "run".

As mentioned previously this is exactly why I have significantly reduced "Basket TP" to a minimal 5 USD, i.e. just to cover ECN commissions: Once a "Basket" is in play (which means that a Batch2 trade had been opened, like right now as shown on the attached screenshot) the only goal of the EA is to escape, i.e. to close the Basket ASAP and reset the EA so it can make REAL PROFITS by Batch1 trades. Over the past 7 trading days ALL significant real profits had been made by Batch1 trades.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Yes, I can confirm it.

Unfortunately "inside grids" have not work out, so they has been eliminated from the forward test. For me it is OK to wait a few days (or weeks) for a breakout from the "neutral zone" (determined always by the upper and lower red TP lines).

Hi

''Close all order at Basket_TakeProfit'' works great.

This is my last question, I promise

It is possible to change the TP functions as in Paracelsus's post 367

If we can do this then the EA should be completed for most of us and everyone will be able to change the settings on own needs.

Hi SwingMan,

You can change the following code from

if(OrderType()==OP_SELL && numSell<=MaxLevel)

{

if(numSell==1) tp=lowestSellPrice -OrderGap *pt;

if(numSell>1) tp=lowestSellPrice-2*pt;

SetTakeProfit(OP_SELL,tp);

}

if(OrderType()==OP_BUY && numBuy<=MaxLevel)

{

if(numBuy==1) tp=highestBuyPrice+OrderGap *pt;

if(numBuy>1) tp=highestBuyPrice+2*pt;

SetTakeProfit(OP_BUY,tp);

}

TO

if(OrderType()==OP_SELL && numSell<=MaxLevel)

{

if(numSell==1) tp=lowestSellPrice -(2 * OrderGap *pt);

if(numSell>1) tp=lowestSellPrice -(2 * OrderGap *pt);

SetTakeProfit(OP_SELL,tp);

}
if(OrderType()==OP_BUY && numBuy<=MaxLevel)

{

if(numBuy==1) tp=highestBuyPrice+(2 * OrderGap *pt);

if(numBuy>1) tp=highestBuyPrice+(2 * OrderGap *pt);

SetTakeProfit(OP_BUY,tp);

}

It's changing the tp.

Thank you, I have now a version 2.3 where I replaced the 2 with a variable as input-parameter.

Unfortunately I have a few new ideas, and have to make some additional tests...

Basket was closed as planned with the sell breakout. MGH has made profit where the market moved. New Batch1 sell positions have been opened.

Summary: +5.6% net profit after 8.5 trading days.

Hello Paracelsus,

is it possible that you can share your MGHEA_V5 with us?

Kind regards,

Edwin

--- 帖子 #768 ---
No, this is still a DEMO forward test. Nevertheless, I do plan to trade it live soon. (Only my "Portfolio" is a live account.)

--- 帖子 #769 ---
As mentioned in previous posts my EA was made by a "pro" programmer and due to copyright issues I cannot share it.

Nevertheless, SwingMan has posted his MGH EA, which should work similarly.

Hello SwingMan,

Great work. Keep it up. Expecting your ideas and results.

Hi SwingMan,

Thanks for your suggestion. Once I've meditated "OM mani padme hom". One day when I've repeated the mantra, I laughed for a long period. I don't know the reason. Aferthat I did'nt do the meditation. From now, I'm on my way.

Thanks a lot.

Hi Paracelsus,

Nice result. I expect this method gives good returns. Nice work and keep it up.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Hi Paracelsus,

just a little question, because I can not see the order closes in your charts:

From your explanations I understand that after opening a second Batch (2 sells, 2 buys) the EA disable the TPs and close all orders for a win of $5.

Is that so?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Yes, absolutely correct. "Basket TP" function is activated as soon as the first "hedge" trade (i.e. Batch2/Trade1) has been opened.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Impressive results FxMasterGuru/Paracelsus!

I've been sort of lurking in this thread. So from what I've gathered, would I be correct to say that this strategy can otherwise be identified as a trend-based strategy that uses cost-averaging (the grid), that uses martingaling and hedging as exit strategy? I most certainly agree with Paracelsus that the sole purpose of Martingale and Hedge are to get the heck out as fast as possible, while minimizing the "Death Trail" so you aptly named.

My questions are:

1.) From your experience, is using only a 200EMA sufficient as a reliable entry? Since this is a trend-based system, how could we improve the entry?

2.) I know this is more complicated but, what are your thought on pyramiding the grid when in profit? This leads to exponential profits.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #778 ---
All credits should go to Kfx. My role in the strategy was just some tweaking and fine tuning.

Yes, your observations and summary are excellent: in its "modified" version MGH is a "trend-based strategy that uses cost-averaging system that uses martingaling and hedging as exit strategy". I have to emphasize that in its modified form, as in the original version martingaling and hedging were major profit makers. In the modified version their role has been reduced simply as an "exit strategy" and to recover ECN commission costs.

Response to your 1st question: Probably there are better trend indicators than H1 EMA200, but as far as I see the strategy is so robust, and market movements are so random, that practically it does not matter in which direction Batch1 is opened. Actually it is the beauty of this strategy.

Concerning your recommendation: Yes, it would exponentially increase profits, however it raises an important question: What if the market makes a sudden and sharp turn (e.g. extreme news) while pyramiding?

Well, of course, the strategy should get ready to exit with Hedge and Martingale, which means that a larger hedge multiplier should be employed. The issue with a larger multiplier is that it has a snowball effect. If the market just did a fake reverse breakout, then the strategy would need to "RE-HEDGE" with an exponentially larger lot number. But what if this next breakout turns out to be fake, too. Again, MGH needs to hedge with exponentially higher lots.

Your recommendation should work out well with higher profitability, but for a "price". Namely: increased risk. Martingales are extremely risky to start with, so when "tweaking" with the original strategy of Kfx, my goals were very simple: to reduce risk as much as possible while preserving some profitability and to make it easy for the strategy to find "escape routes" to avoid the "Death Trail".

After a meditation about hands clap with one hand, I finished the version 2.3.

The EA is still in work. There are still some errors in it, but the arrows look beautiful ...

- The entrys are made for new bars.

- I tested charts on M15, the trend is determined on H1 with two SMA 8 for typical prices, normal and with shift 1. (John Ehlers used this trend indicator)

You can also take the EMA 200 trend.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Thanks a lot Swingman! You are a very kind person! I was thinking that if you can add to the EA a support and resistance filter will be good, even that the martingale works again the trend, is always better go with the basic of the trading, trend and support/ resistance, so that way we minimize the quantity of baskets and martingale levels. Just my two cents. Thanks again and keep up your great work.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
All is well and good, but I was just trying to adapt the existing program of GoldenEA to the ideas of Paracelsus. He has posted many results here and I'm just trying to reproduce it.

For new ideas, please make evaluations and post charts. If I program had no time to think ...

Hi moncsicsi78

EA works fine for me without any errors

Thanks again SwingMan!!

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi Kaczucha, I am very glad of it, but it doesn't help me...

--- 帖子 #788 ---
I do not think so ...

On my platform I get no such message. The line 700 calculates internally a moving average, so that is not my error.

But, there are a few other errors that I need to investigate later.

Why test you on M1? I have tested on M15, and we are consistently looking for bugs.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
...because I haven't got M15 tick data, just M1...

Maybe the problem is that EA calculate the MA period based on higher timeframe, and I haven't got tick data from them?...

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Yes, the EA calculate the MAs on H1.

But EVERY MT4 platform has this data.

Maybe must you load in a Chart data for M1 until H1 and then start the tester. For questions about MT4 is not here the place to give explanations (test, test, test and then ask, also I do this).

--- 帖子 #791 ---
But there is another question and I don't want to insult you: why doesn't the EA close its trades (and why not open other buy trades? - MaxLevel=4)

EDITED: Sorry, I watched ONLY one side profit, and NOT THE basket profit! :

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I understood!
Just for you, a version with a TimeFrame parameter for the calculation of the trend direction.

The logic of the EAs is also still unclear to me. I test further, maybe it will work eventually...

There are a few variants to open and close the trades, so there are still errors.

In your chart I see only that the "OpenSellProfit+OpenBuyProfit" is still negative, and not +5.

If possible please do not just ask, but describe the problems and give possible solutions. We have seen that the perfect EAs from Kfx and Paracelsus are private developments, and if only I develop the EA, I can not post it more... (this is not my thread).

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Thank you SwingMan, once again!

...I believed that I described my problem exactly with the attached picture... I can't describe in more detail... (And now I EDITED my previous post!)

However I understand the logic of the Kfx's system, I haven't got idea how can it make more safe and/or profitable... But I never trust 100% in a single currency trading, I always trade on multi currency based. Maybe this system will also be better in multi currency mode, and closing every trade together in common profit.

And another idea (?): what would be if the EA will be able to open pyramid orders next to the current logic? I mean: imagine there are already 3 sell orders. If the price goes up, the EA can open not only the hedged trades (3 buy orders with multiplicated lot size), but if the price continues to go up, the EA will open pyramid orders in the direction of the trend, and every new pyramid order will be protected with trailing stop.

I hope it is understandable! (Because of my English...)

Regardless of anything else trailing stop function would be usefull, I think, because in choppy market the EA would be able to earn more money while swinging.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi Paracelsus,

I understand you can't provide your EA but could you show your backtest this year ?

Best regards.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I definitely think GM EAs (with hedging) is the way for me in forex, but I have found it difficult to ascertain the best settings to use on different pairs (unfortunately I am not that smart).

Are there any resident mathematicians who have come up with an algebraic formula that can help determine this?

The solution I am thinking of involves:

-a parabolic graph to plot profit results

-an algebraic formula

-using the variables of grid-size, TP, and martingale factor

-ability to input these variables in a spreadsheet for further analysis (or graph plotting)

Has anyone found something even remotely like what I am looking for?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
You are right but we try here to get an EA that works somewhat like the original idea of KFX with the small changes of Paracelsus. Everything else I think belongs in an other new thread.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I am about to download tick data. Without tick data I could test only about 6 months.

Just some major numbers: +7%/month average profit, -15% max. floating DD and max. Batch4 (i.e. Hedge4) entries. Any attempt to increase profits has resulted in the need of utilizing Batch5 (Hedge5), which has resulted in max. -35% floating DD. As expected higher profits come with higher risk.

As soon as I can import historical tick data in my MT4, I will publish backtest results.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Great, I agree 100%. Thanks a lot SwingMan.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Those are some really nice stats - 7% monthy income is really, really good if you look at it in the long run... Drawdown is not really as high as i thought it would be which is even better. I'd love to see the historical data.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Once it can be confirmed by backtests that - with the current structure and settings - the chance of a "Death Trail" is extremely low, then the next steps will be finding other suitable pairs.

You can introduce that:

extern double EquityLossPercent = 10;

then

if (AccountEquity()<(AccountBalance()*(1-(EquityLossPercent/100))))

and

int CloseOrders(int Magic)

{

int total=OrdersTotal();

for (int cnt=total-1;cnt>=0;cnt--)

{

OrderSelect(cnt,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES);

if(OrderMagicNumber()==Magic)

{

int type=OrderType();

bool result=false;

switch(type)

{

case OP_BUY : result=OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(),MODE_BID),5,Red);

break;

case OP_SELL : result=OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(),MODE_ASK),5,Red);

break;

case OP_BUYLIMIT :

case OP_BUYSTOP :

case OP_SELLLIMIT :

case OP_SELLSTOP : result=OrderDelete( OrderTicket() );

}

if(result==false)

{

Alert("Order ",OrderTicket()," failed to close. Error:",GetLastError());

Sleep(3000);

}

}

}

return(0);

}

But if that occurs many times it's bad....

--- 帖子 #806 ---
I've previously written that are still small problems because I do changes in the existing code

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Just an update. Additional preliminary backtest results show that a -20% Basket SL is not enough to exhaust the maximum potential of a Batch3/Batch4 basket, which means that cutting losses at -10% after Batch5 entry is not a viable option.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
That is ok. Sorry to bother you.

Time to start the weekend so have a nice one all

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Kfx - the author of this strategy - has just informed me that in his backtests there had been significant SL events even with -50% Global SL setting.

I am still about to do my own backtests to see how often does the strategy hit the "Death Trail".

If the current settings lead to frequent Global SL, the only choice is to reduce lot size (e.g. from 0.1 lot to 0.02 lot) which would allow the EA to use more Hedge levels. Of course profit expectancy would fall significantly. But lets say that "Death Trail" could be avoided with 99.99% certainty while gaining 1.5% average monthly profit (i.e. 18% per year). Well, this 1.5% may not sound too attractive, but it would qualify the strategy for the "Holy Grail" contest of Forex.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Excuse me, I can promise not to write any idea here!

--- 帖子 #811 ---
I guess I found the answer to my question...

--- 帖子 #812 ---
The strategy, as it is in the EA's founded in this thread, doesn't have good backtest at all. I did a lot of backtests with these EAs with many settings, on more pairs, and there aren't good results.

So the base of the strategy is good, but not enough in itself. Needed some modifications, improvements.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
So lets work on it! Reverse engineering might be a path to success.

Namely: Finding an extremely unlikely (or at best: never seen) "Death Trail" price movement pattern and to build the strategy around it.
_________________________________

Bluepanther has summarized the mathematical side of similar approaches very well. Thank you, Bluepanther, and please stay with us here!

Finding an extremely unlikely - or "never seen" - "Death Trail" pattern is theoretically possible, even if the profits are not too impressive. Once this unlikely or never seen "Death Trail" is found, the rest is just "paperwork".

Just "off-hand" I can give an extreme example of a never seen price pattern: After "London Open" the market does not move at least 2 pips in any direction within the first 30 minutes. What are the chances of it (0.0000000000000001%)? Can anybody show a day in history when the price did this idling "price pattern" after London Open? I doubt it. So - theoretically - a "Holy Grail" could be constructed around this "never seen price pattern", namely that the price will break out of a 2 pips range with 99.999999999999999999% certainty within the first 30 minutes after "London Open". Again, it was just a theoretical exercise, but similarly "never seen price patterns" can be the basis of a successful MGH strategy.

In my approach of tweaking MGH I have followed this path and I ask fellow "MGH fans" to do the same.

I am positive that by reverse engineering an unlikely (or better: never seen) "Death Trail", MGH has a good fighting chance. Why am I so sure about it? Beacuse market movements are not random "mathematical" phenomena. (Lucky for us: they are driven by  human emotions, i.e. mainly greed and fear.)

And this simple fact can be our "EDGE" to perfect MGH.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
I can not give more technical details here, but I think there is a very simple "mathematical" solution.

With the two-step Batch grid proposed by Paracelsus, one can calculate a variable lot size, and for each step in the two-step Batch there is another lot value.

Just as Paracelsus wrote, one should primarily take into account the gains of Batch1 and all other batches should end with a small plus.

The lot multipliers remain small and the drawdown is not more dangerous.

Think about it and if anyone understands the idea, maybe can I help later. At the moment I will also make tests about it.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Increasing BatchX/Trade2 lot size would definitely increase profits. On the other hand, it would require a higher than 2.5x lot multiplier. At least 3x.

For example: If Batch1/Trade1 runs with 0.1 lot and Batch1/Trade2 with 0.15 lots, then with a sudden reverse move a 3x multiplier, i.e. 0.3 lots are needed for Batch2 trades to hedge for the total of 0.25 lots Batch1 positions and to make some net profit even on a sharp counter move.

In my experiments a 3x lot multiplier has resulted in significantly larger DDs. Again it comes down to the fact that higher profits come with higher risk.

So first we should establish what risk is acceptable, and then to look at the profit side.

But even before that I would look for a very low probability "Death Trail" and reverse engineer the entire structure around it.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
If somebody can do backtests with 99% tick data (for example from Dukascopy), please attach profitable and nice test results here, with any version of MGH EA's can be founded in this thread!

Let's collect as promising settings as possible!

It will help everybody to imagine and thinking forward of the base logic.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
My analysis show just the opposite ...
Decreasing BatchX / Trade2 lot size would definitely decrease drowdown.

In order to increase the profit we can increase the base lot size.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Sorry, I misunderstood. The "variable" was not clear to me, i.e. it referred to decreasing BatchX/Trade2 lot sizes.

Well, it sounds like an explorable idea, which can be "stretched" to the extreme even by leaving "BatchX/Trade2" entries completely out of the equation... How about that?

It would definitely reduce DD even for larger baskets, which could safely include Batch5 and even Batch6. Accommodating Batch5 and even Batch6 entries safely (i.e. with tolerable DD) would significantly (exponentially) reduce the chance of hitting a "Death Trail".

I would not be surprised that if our final conclusion will be that even a Batch10 is needed to avoid the "Death Trail" by 99.99% certainty.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Correct, I also thought about this.

I have developed a system with "very safe" entrys. The little problem is that sometimes just after the entry occurs small reverses, therefore am I come to this thread and believe that just your simplification on two-steps grid may be helpful to avoid early exits.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
I will give you my thoughts and experiences on MGH EAs thus far, and specifically related to an EA I purchased from a failed MQL5.com signal provider earlier this year. I have tried using this EA on EURUSD as was successfully shown by the signal provider until about May, when the EU peaked at 1.4 and then came crashing down suddenly and blowing up the signal account.

I was unable to duplicate the phenomenal returns of the SP, nor was I able to repeat my 120% gain of December 2013 using a different GM EA (with no hedging). Definitely, a hedging aspect added on a GMEA increases profitability and also risk - but margin requirement is obviously reduced as both sides of a trade are taken (sorry to US investors that can't hedge).

I see two ways of successful employment of MGH EAs:You can improve "account survivability" by filtering entries using indicators or time, but this will reduce the EA's frequency of trading (and thus profits). This approach may be mandatory on pairs with large price fluctuations, including EURUSD. Eg. filtering EA to operate only during Asian session. Or keeping the EA simply MGH with no entry filters. This is only possible on a tight-ranging pair such as EURCHF. In either method, pair-specific analysis to determine the best settings is mandatory: every pair behaves differently with variances in volatility, pip cost, spreads, etc.

​For me I am sticking to a simple approach, namely focusing on: a) grid size, and b) martingale factor. Also, the EA I currently use opens two first trades - in a sense this lowers the "logarithmic / exponential" effect of the martingale (albeit marginally), since the grid now goes: Level 1 (2 x 0.1 = 0.2), L2 (0.11), L3 (0.12), L4 (0.13), etc. (for example). Therefore I am sticking to EURCHF-only for now.

I am hoping to analyse and determine other pairs suitable for a simple MGH strategy without filters, since I pursue a HFT-strategy.

Folks should always remember: account survivability is the 'name of the game' - profits are secondary.

"In the chart, the height of a bar is equivalent to how often a certain price appears in the price curve. The red bars are based on the EUR price in Swiss Francs (EUR/CHF) since October 2011; the green bars are the EUR price in US Dollars (EUR/USD) in the same time period. You can generate such a chart with the Distribution script. We can see that the red EUR/CHF price distribution is quite narrow and ends abruptly on the left, as if cut with a knife. In contrast, the green EUR/USD price distribution is much wider with a broad peak in the middle. It resembles a bell curve (more or less), which indicates a random price distribution. The EUR/CHF distribution however is no bell curve. It reveals a market inefficiency that can generate profit in automated trading. In this case, the inefficiency is the result of the CHF price ceiling that was established by the Swiss National Bank in September 2011. It prevents the EUR from ever dropping below 1.20 CHF. This market inefficiency is used to your advantage in Zorro's Z5 strategy." (http://www.zorro-trader.com/manual/en/strategy.htm)

--- 帖子 #821 ---
I don't want you to be sad, but if a grid EA can work safety only with indicators and/or choosing the most ranging pairs - it is very bad.

I think and it is my 4 years experience (especially with grid-hedge strategies) that using indicators or any other "signals" to try to make a grid EA safer, it is just a waste of time. It just delays the MC.

Using multi currency on one account: it is a good risk management, because of diversification. And to use many pairs (up to 28) no mandatory to know their "behavior", because of the causes mentioned above. It is enough to know that a pair rather trending or rather ranging, and you can choose a startegy that most suited to it (grid stategy, just you cab use "grid against trend"; "grid or pyramid with trend" or "range break out grid", like the well known Sure Fire Hedging Strategy).

But it is not enough in itself, of course!

Try to determine the direction of a pair or just the probability of it: it is just an unncessary energy-killer activity.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Thanks for the idea, Bluepanther! I guess, the next step would be to fine tune MGH on EUR/CHF instead of on EUR/USD and probably by using SMALLER BatchX/Trade2 lot sizes as per SwingMan's recommendation.

I have agree with Moncsicsi, i.e. "guessing" the direction BETTER can be misleading, as it may just mask potential "Death Trails", i.e. we should clearly see the chance of hitting one.

Further ideas are welcome! Please join the discussion.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I share 3 EAs, I found them somewhere on the NET.

If somebody feel spirit, test is on visual test mode, with the attached settings, so you can learn its strategy.

I know well that this thread is for MGH strategy, and I don't want to make an OFF TOPIC, but I think to watch,  learn something else is sometimes necessary to make further improvement on the current strategy.

So my intention with sharing other EAs in this thread is to "wake up new ideas" to make the MGH strategy much better.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
It is much appreciated your intention

--- 帖子 #825 ---
@Moncsicsi: I definitely agree with you on diversification, but any MGH will require considerable margin on one pair alone - on 28 pairs you would be looking at starting your account with a minimum of $100,000 (and perhaps I am underestimating this amount - that's less than $4000 per pair). Of course, depends on grid size, martingale factor, starting lots (0.01), and pairs' volatility. I quite agree that filters for entry is detrimental to the performance (and profits) of an EA, but what about time filter (eg. Asian session only)? This way risk is controlled better because volatility is lowered (exaggerated movements are less likely), and a smaller grid can be utilised to preserve profits on the lower activity.

Keep in mind: diversification mitigates pair-specific risk but concurrently increases inherent risk, the same way that hedging mitigates trend risk but increases inherent risk.

It is important to analyse and review current pair behaviour (especially range), since some pairs exhibit specific behaviour due to extraneous factors (eg. interest rates/carry trading, commodity pairs, being a "major pair", market sessions, central bank interventions, etc.).

Yes, the whole concept of hedging is to "catch" the market regardless of direction - attempts to predict are both contrary and futile.'Time spent in reconnaissance is seldom wasted.' John Marsden 'If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.' Sun Tzu ​...and thank you for the ex gratia EAs!

Yes, ultimately I am hoping to increase volume on EURCHF to lower spreads with my broker, so it is more efficient for MGH EAs to trade on!

On a serious note, EURCHF exhibits its tight range due to central banking intervention - a market inefficiency as observed by Zorro that we can take advantage of!

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Bluepanther: if I use 28 pairs for any type of grid trading, -maybe it is unbelievable, but there is no need to deposit a huge amount! The reason is simple: there will always be more pair, which are in profit while the other will be in loss! The pairs which are in profit, increase the free margin.

And that's why I use more pairs...

One example: if we go long trade on the 28 pairs at the same time, there will always be more or less pairs, which will be in profit! (And this is the same situation if we start trading with short orders.) Because the probability of going down every pair at the same time is relatively smaller! (And vice versa.)

The pairs which is going in to profit, sooner or later will be closed - the number of the pairs in trading will decrease.

But as I wrote before: this not a hole startegy, it is just a portion or view of the hole strategy.

And I also wrote that we can combine different type of grid strategies at the same time. For example the more trending JPY pairs we should use "trending grid" strategies, or "range break out grid". At the same time on the ranging pairs we should use "grid against trend" strategies.

And yea, I think closing all pairs together in a common profit is better then closing each pairs alone, because the "good pairs" (which are in profit) will be able to collect more and more profit while the "bad" pairs (which are in loss) try to go profit. When we close everything, we can see that some pairs were in loss in itself (maybe they can cause a MC if they were just alone on the account...) , but we can close in spite of this because there are other pairs, which profits are enough to close everything in net profit.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Understood. I am speaking from the standpoint of the EA working on pairs in separate grids - you speak of a basket-trading strategy. Definitely a good idea!

In that case pair-specific analysis is less important (especially if the EA does all that for you automatically), as perhaps too the considerable margin as pairs are managed conjunctively.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Here is a new EA version 3.1

For the calculation of lots for each batch and trades 1 or 2, was used a special algorithm in order to reduce the drawdown (see "MGH BatchLots").

You can test different grid values, take profits equal to 0 or 5, lot sizes, etc., and report what comes out...

I hope there are not too many errors this time...

test, GJ, today...

the 3 set of trades produced a total of 15 positions, and +38$ profit /clear, after already from the 27$ commission deducted/

would the new system make considerably different results, or there is no significant difference between the 2 versions.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Based on reported backtest results by Kfx (as mentioned before) it seems that with the current settings the "Death Trail" could not be avoided even with 50% Global SL, so based on multiple suggestions in this blog I would support diversification between multiple (20+) pairs to reduce the risk of a "Death Trail".

In addition, reducing BatchX/Trade2 positions (as per SwingMan) would give a chance to further reduce the chance of a "Death Trail".

Even with a slight technical glitch after the weekly VPS restart the forward test is still looking good (even "too good"), i.e. +9% net profit over the past 2 weeks. It also means that there is still room to accept less profit for less risk.

Here is a new EA version 4.1

- Calculation of different lot sizes for each batch and trade 1 or 2, as in version 3.1

- Trend direction is calculated with EMA Slope on M15 for the period 32, which roughly corresponds to the H1.

- Variable grid intervals calculated with the ATR. For this reason I tested/recomand the M15 time frame.

(For me it is always difficult to take or to optimize fixed grid spaces, so the ATR)

If you test test this version, you'll probably find that it is more stable than 3.1.

No idea what your platform makes.

In any case I see that "Order Grid = 0", and so the put of an TP=0 caused the error message.

@SwingMan

You mentioned: "Variable grid intervals calculated with the ATR"

Could you please describe how grid interval calculation is done based on ATR? Thanks!

Only for "Batch 1" and "Trade 1" I calculate the ATR(14) and a MA(5) on it. This value replace the fixed grid interval for orders.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Pay attention and compare the version 3.1 with 4.1 in tester. For me 4.1 is better, but need a capital of 10,000.

There are still possibilities to optimize further the EA, let's see...

--- 帖子 #841 ---
is clear that more capital minus risk, but if I put it on a live account, I do not want to risk more than 500E with 0.01 ... with this batch would have to be able to increase it-even just a couple.

I start next week to try the new version of EA.

I agree with uniformity with all backtests, but can we please use 0.01 lots? I could not afford to fund my real account with sufficient margin to cover a MGH system using 0.1 lots. Let's try to keep this as "real" as possible please?

Because unless you have a means of "taming" your MGH, the compounding effects of the margingale will certainly ensure a swift demise of your account on 0.1 lots and $10,000 balance.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Hi Clipi.

Which version of EA do you use?

It cant be the latest version I think

Thx

--- 帖子 #856 ---
The problem with 0.01 lot is that it is hard to use small lot mulitpliers with it.

For example: if using a 1.5x or a 0.5x multiplier with a 0.01 starting lot, the EA cannot open 0.015 lot or 0.005 lot positions, so the backtests would give very inaccurate results. With 0.1 lot starting lot any multiplier would work smoothly.

In my opinion 0.1 lot/10k is the minimum account size.

But anyway, it is only for TESTING purpose. Real llife application can be adjusted individually.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
it's MGH EA v3.1

Hi Paracelsus

the starting lot is 0.02 no 0.01

I tried 0.1 baselot with several parameters (gridfactor,basket_tradeprofit,etc..) from january and all backtests have crashed

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I have a doubt respect v4.1

-because 0.05 second lot used? gives better results?

-according standards rules, TP = grid size = 10 pips? With TP_grithfactor = 2 TP = 30 pips.

-which means "Basket take profit"?

very thanks!!

--- 帖子 #860 ---
I apologize for the request that may seem trivial, but how do I install the EA in MT4 build 745? thanks

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Probably because we are using different EAs... In my forward tests (and backtests) I use 10k with 0.1 start lots to make life simpler...

Forward test is still looking good with approx. 10% net profit over the past 13 days. Current Basket includes Batch2 and Batch3.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
With this system, we need a real backtest from several months to know if we can avoid the "death trade".

We'll know if your EA is safe when we see your backtests.

13 days is not enough to evaluate the safety.

Draw Order Arrows

Hi Paracelsus,

here a little tool only for you:

Because the EAs dont draw close arrows and trendlines between open and close, you can drop the "DrawOrderArrows" script in your charts.

To test this, you can open a new chart window for EURUSD and drop the script. Then can you drop in your trading chart.

The functions in the script can be added in every EA.

If OK, please post your charts with arrows (and trend lines)

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Thanks for the files, SwingMan!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Even 13 months backtests are not enough to assess the chance of a "Death Basket". As mentioned before, as per Kfx (the Author) with the current settings of the forward test the "Death Basket" is unavoidable.

So, in my next forward test the following changes will be implenented based on recommendations in this thread:

- Diversification between 10+ pairs by using "Super-Basket". (Can anyone suggest a group of at least "unrelated" or "loosly" related pairs?)
- Reducing the lot sizes of 2nd trades in each Batch.

Any further suggestions how to reduce the likelihood of a "Death Basket"?

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Whats configuration are you using in this EA? (version 3.1)

Default?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Understood.

As to your question about reducing risk of a "death trade":

1. What about the EA having a function that activates when MAs show a strong trend, and the EA then opens some scalping trades in the direction of the trend? This will: a) hedge the grid, b) increase margin when trailing stops close the trend scalp. Size could be say, 50% of current grid in DD...? Or x multiples of starting lots, or simply a fixed preset lot? Edit: this is a hedging EA, so just increase the sizes of the trades going in the direction of the trend?

2. I haven't yet had a chance to look at your EA here, but I hope your EA will abstain from opening new trades if the market breaks out rapidly ie. it will not open trades immediately one after another, but pause for say 60 seconds prior to opening a new trade.

We are talking of an exceptional market in the case of a death trade.

@ Clipi: Impressive results!

@ Swingman: Absolutely necessary addition to have! Nice one!

Edit: I might also add that Martingale factor is very important, since it has a compounding effect. I have tried systems using 1.5 (50% increase) and lowering them to 1.2 (20% increase) and still that was too much. Now I am working with x 1.01 (increase upon previous trade of only 1%). Just another thing to keep in mind in avoiding a death trade.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Defaut settings, but initial lot = 0.01

--- 帖子 #869 ---
@BluePanther

1. "Just increase the sizes of the trades going in the direction of the trend? "when MAs show a strong trend" - Good thought, it is worth to look into it. The question: How would you quantify a strong trend by MA?

2. There is no "pause" in my version as the settings are designed so that the strategy would BENEFIT from very rapid market moves.
The key is that the size of the first hedging position should be larger than the combined lot size of the previous Batch. For example: If Batch1/Trade1 is 0.1 lot and Batch1/Trade2 os 0.05 lots (i.e. 0.15 lots combined), then Batch2/Trade1 (the first hedge) should be at least 0.2 lots. It means that the EA could close the Basket even with the largest vertical market move IN PROFIT and reset itself.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
1. Something like a 25 and 50 MA with a 20 bar count for example (depending on timeframe)?

2. Rapid movements (breakouts) could be a precursor to a long-term sentiment change, meaning the market will continue without reversing (hence my "pause" suggestion). Example: EURUSD May 2014 when it peaked and then sustained a huge fall. But sounds like you have a strategy with the hedge to counter this possibility.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Forget it, such a Grid oder Martingale or whatever

NEVER

works. It's a waste of time!

If it would be that easy, everyone would do it!

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Please, allow me to remind you:

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Being a Martingale-Grid-Hedge strategy any tweaking with the settings has strong RIPPLE EFFECT (i.e. chain reaction) which has to be considered seriously.

So if we "increase the sizes of the trades going in the direction of the trend" then with an unexpectd reversal of the "strong trend" the NEXT Hedge Batch and all subsequent Hedge Batches HAVE TO BE exponentially larger as one of the core principles of the strategy is that from Batch2 (hedge) each further hedges are hedged, then re-hedged and again re-hedged: until Global TP or the "Death Trade".

--- 帖子 #874 ---
@Trader121

Who said that it was easy...? Your statement of "NEVER" reminds me of Charles H. Duell who was the Commissioner of US Patent Office in 1899.

Mr. Deull's most famous attributed utterance is that "everything that can be invented has been invented..."

Yeah... I guess he did not trade from his iPad via broadband satellite connection from his yacht cruising the Caribbeans...

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Understood. Compounding effect. In addition, the hedge on a hedge can negate profits on the original batch.

For clarification, my suggestion is simply a one-off order with trailing stop. If:

a) market continues its strong move, the order stays open until closed on reversal.

b) market reverses soon after, the order is closed for a possible loss but that is the cost of insurance. Let us assume the market then continues its strong move: the EA can then repeat assessment using MAs, and determine if necessary to open "insurance trade" again.

The possibility is that the market may have entered a consolidation, where the MAs may not trigger the insurance trade again, and the DD grid will remain open since there is insufficient reversal. Then the market will continue on... (and MC the account).

I have the same problem: I want test "live" this ea, but I can't invest more than 1000 € for the test on my cloud/vps...

I tried different settings of the ea, but of course the strategy tester gave better performance by default setting....

But by default settings, with 1000 euro...it looks dangerous...

I have tested Mgh 1 , 2 , and 3 also but for some reason the basket tp does not work, the multiplier does not work (all orders same size) ...

Can someone change  v1 or v2.3 for each order to be created the same way but individually to get a trailing stop instead of basket profit? It might be worth to check how that goes.

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Just a thought if it had not yet been considered:

What about progressive lot size use instead of a multiplying factor for martingale?

I read about it in this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=508537

--- 帖子 #891 ---
There will be advantages and disadvantages of big lotmultiplicator.

There are no absolute rules. It depends on a lot of other factor.

But there would be better if the lotmulti was changed by users.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Do you understand what I mean by progressive lot size? I mean lot size of trades increasing by a standard increment (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as opposed to a multiplication factor (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). One can observe that a multiplication factor will compound both profits and losses by an order of magnitude.

Further to this possibility:

a) Lot size could either be reset to [level] 1 at the close of the grid (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1), or

b) Lot size could follow a progression lower (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4) (higher risk)

Anyway, some suggestions to consider.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Yes, I do...

My modified version already uses the principle of reducing Basket Profit (i.e. Global TP) to 5 USD (to cover commissions). Of course, the smaller the Global TP, the sooner the basket will be closed.

The "only" question is where is the optimal "basket loss" level, i.e. sacrificing "hard earned" profits by closing baskets in LOSS for the purpose of "fast escape from the basket" and. getting a chance for a "new start".

--- 帖子 #898 ---
As you said before the first batch is a real profit maker so let try to get out of the basket asap even with less profit.

We know that the closing position of e.g. Batchx4 or higher is very hard so that my suggestion.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
When the EA is in Batch3/Batch4 "basket mode", i.e. having 2 x 0.65 and 2 x 1.6 lots in play (total 4.5 lots), each pip is worth 45 USD, so - concerning pip moves - the price move difference to get out with  -5 USD or +5 USD is negligible: approx. 0.2 pips.

So if the strategy's viability depended on a mere 0.2 pips Global TP reduction (i.e. coming out with +5 or -5 USD) at Batch3/Batch4, well, I would worry even more wether to use MGH on a live account or not...

--- 帖子 #900 ---
2 questions:

1) MGH 4.1 on VPS works very well, on EurUsd 15m chart.

But backtesting the same period of the demo, there is a bad result backtested !

2) Very big differences in backtesting on more brokers mt4, although same settings, same 90% modelling quality, same time...etc...etc...

Why the same historical data can give so many and huge difference in backtest?

Hi, what kind of backtesting are you using?

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Here is a new EA version 4.2

- check please if after closing and restarting the platform, the EA continous to work properly

- if the parameter "Use_LotMultiplier=true" (I suppose that) you can trade like the Paracelsus EA version

- instead of a fix value for the second lot, you can take a percent from the base lot

Of my few tests seems that the variable ATR grid is not so good (this was my idea).

What you must do is to determine for each pair the optimal grid distance.

You can take "Entry_OnlyAtNewBars=false" to begin to trade just after a basket close (it seems to be better). "Entry only at new bars" can you take to better see the entrys.

Actually I am using a different EA, but the same principle.

Settings are simple:

1. Starting with 0.1 lot (altough I plan to reduce BatchX/Lot2 (i.e. the 2nd trade of each Batch) by 50% as per SwingMan's suggestion in this blog.

2. LotMultiplier: 2.5 (which can be reduced to 2 with the above modification, so to give more margin room for occasional and unavoidable high Batches)

3. TP: 20 pips for Batch1/Trade1 and 30 pips for Batch1/Trade2

4. Globalt TP: 5 USD (to cover commissions, however, I plan to make it progressive as after multiple Batches the 5 USD just will not cover the trading costs)

5. Global SL: still testing the optimal setting (demo forward and backtests), although I think that there is no optimal SL here... One has to find a setup which never has to quit in the middle of a Basket as recovery time would be simply enourmous. So my goal is finding a set of Parameters which has miniscule chance of wiping out an account.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hi there,

i am running both v2.2 and v4.1 in sepparate terminals and different brokers. What i see though is sort of strange. Both EAs enter exactly 2 trades which are 10 pips apart because of the grid. Those trades are always at a point that the price direction turns and that's it. Only 2 trades (even with a 500k account and 1 lot per trade), they run in the negative from half a day to as much as 2 days. At best i have 2 positions per currency pair and as i said they run in the negative for days.

The odd thing is that the trades are only 2, never been more that that despite the price movement

I use 10 pips grid distance and only ONCE per direction.

It seems that 10 pips are just fine to catch retracements if the trend continues. Giving "more room" for retracements would delay the entry of the "hedge" trade and increase the floating DD the "hedge" trade has to deal with.

Once Batch2/Trade1 (i.e. the 3rd trade in a row) is opened the name of the game is: "ESCAPE from the BASKET". So my EA runs the same way as SwingMan's.

In other words: when Batch2/Trade1 is opened the EA is already hedging Batch1 and anticipating a possible trend reversal. The 4th trade (i.e. Batch2/Trade2) is a "pullback" entry, and the purpose of it is to facilitate the "escape", if and when the trend reverses.

As seen on todays's screenshot, the basket opened yesterday was closed with profit today, and a new BUY Batch was opened as the trend (as per 200EMA) is still up.

Hello all,

first post here in FF. I want to start giving thanks to all of you for your great contribution and help given to new ones like me. I have been trading for 2 years now with no high success but there is something in trading that makes me to do not give up.

Swingman, I have a suggestion for your nice EA. As stated several times before,  the benefits of the system comes from the first batch and next batches are to facilitate the escape. We can see that lot of times we require of those next batches, meaning that we were not succesfull in selection of direction of first batch.

My idea is to have the possibility to do the first entry batch against the trend, with this we can add the EA to two different EURUSD charts, one to follow the trend and the second to enter against the trend.

With this, we will ensure that at least one of them will be right into the selection of the first batch. I hope that this will increase the overall profitability while not increasing the risk significantly.

Excellent idea, Mastersenseo! Thanks!!

With your suggestion the profitability of the strategy can be practically doubled, assuming that picking Batch1/Trade1 direction based on 1-hr EMA200 had a 50% chance of winning the 1st Batch. Even if this chance were 60%, still - entering in both direction - would bring in some more profits without increasing the risk.

Nevertheless, robotising of this bi-directional entry method would be challenging as one EA (the one which has completed a 20 or 50 pips TP) should continuously monitor the other "suffering" EA  (running on another chart) for Basket closure.

Question to SwingMan: Do you think it can be programmed? (Namely: the two EAs are monitoring each other, or a 3rd EA is monitoring the two MGH EAs and allowing new Batch1 trades on both charts ONLY when both EAs have completed their cycles).

Do you mean by building a bi-directional MGH EA...?

--- 帖子 #934 ---
What's happen if we put one Ea only long and other only short in two different charts with 2 magic number?

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Yes, something like that. One would have to formulate an algorithm. Check the snowball idea, maybe can be do something in this direction.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
The issue with two non-synchronous EA is that at any point they may align in the same direction which might double the DD.

So once started together, the EA which reaches TP first would have to wait with its next "Batch1/Trade1" entry until the other one reaches its Global TP, i.e. when it can escape from the Basket. Then, and only then they could open new simultaneous bi-directional "Batch1/Trade1" trades according to Mastersenseo's idea.

Hi , I thought the snopwball idea was meant to be a manager with MANUAL closing the current trades at hand ?

--- 帖子 #938 ---
I think you're right Paracelsus , they would both go their own way if they don't wait for one another.

It is possible to make as many EA's in ONE file as you want but I imagine its a hard job to do !!

Test run: EUR/USD from 2014-07-07 -- 2014-11-08 with basic settings in MGH EA_v4.2 with only one setting changed: BaseLot=1.35

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

@Paracelsus: would you run that same period too on your EA so we can see the differences? tnx

Remarks on this test:largest lots used = 166.05 lots there are more baskets then single (or double) trades the baskets close at zero profit/zero loss (as intended but much more baskets then normal trades) close-all works fine in a test or demo but will never work like that on a live account (closing a trade takes time!) General: what is an EMA doing here in a Grid system ?

Some stuff to think about. cheers,

vaper

edit: after close-all the new 1st trade is opened immediately. This will not work on live account without issues (depends on broker)

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Excellent idea Mastersenseo!

Everything happens on the same chart and a hedging account is needed for this system. So, it must be easy to open both Buy & Sell every time at the 1st and 2nd trade after a close all.

Hello SwingMan, if you want to memorize the crucial info you can use a file or just lines.

Draw the lines far away from from real-time and put info in their title.

I haven't test it, but the structur of the EA will not help out on this strategie. This Ea is briliantly working, really almost excellent ,but needs to improve on MM and exits, the need of bigger capital to trade over longer period because of the DD, big lot sizes. Focus focus hokkus pokus

--- 帖子 #943 ---
@vaper

Thanks for the - little surprising - results.

The most surprising finding was that "there were more baskets then single (or double) trades", especially that EMA200 related Batch1/Trade1 direction choice was intended to get (at least slightly) more single/double trades (i.e. "home run" TP from Batch1 trades) than Baskets. Based on your results EMA related initial direction choice was clearly counterproductive. Wow...! Who would have expected that...?

I have just downloaded tick data via TickStory and I am about to do my very first 99% backtest, so at this moment I cannot confirm the above results.

Also, I have just asked my programmer to remove the EMA related direction choice and to modify my own version of MGH EA to become BI-DIRECTIONAL, so this way the 20 pips or 50 pips TP would be GUARANTEED with each new pair of trades. In other words: One entry direction will profit 20 or 50 pips, while the other entry direction will get out at BE (or 5 USD profit to cover commissions) from the Basket.

Also, I have added UltraGlobal_TP to the Settings, as I am planning to use the EA on multiple (at least 10 loosely correlated pairs) simultaneously for diversification and risk reduction. So if one or two pairs are in "trouble" the other pairs can "sacrifice" their floating profits to rescue the "troubled" pairs which are struggling to get out of a Batch3/Batch4 Basket, for example. So if and when floating profit on the account reaches UltraGlobal_TP, all the trades on all pairs are closed at once and the EA resets itself on all pairs. I am planning to do more extensive backtesting on this new version.

So from this new version of (bi-directional and diversified) MGH EA I expect increased safety and at least DOUBLE profitability.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Hi,

The bi-directional idea sounds very interesting. However, even though it does guarantee a TP of Batch1, it also guarantees at least a Batch1/Trade2 on the opposite trade, and very likely a hedging Batch2. Sometimes i find that most of my profits come from surfing the Batch1/Trade1 trades on a strong trend. However, I am very eager to try and implement this. The very ideal scenario of this would be a TP of Batch1/Trade1 in the buy direction, while the hedging sell trade hits Batch1/Trade2, and then retraces back to TP.

At the moment I have been employing MGH with discretionary entries and exits, and I've been up 80% for the week, on a $3000 account with 0.1 lot size (risky, i know). I don't believe in 100% automation. Despite what many say, the market is definitely not random, and i believe it is the collective psychology of all of its participants. Many times, price can only go one way, and it would be stupid to have a majority of your hedged lot size in the opposite direction. The longer the price runs, the more reason it has to come retrace. Take UJ for example, it broke through 118, and started to grind to a retrace. I wouldn't keep piling up buys anymore, but instead probably pick the tops and bottom of the channel.

Another thing i believe is important is volatility. It allows us to get out of the hedge faster, and decreases the chances of a range which blows up our martingale. One suggestion would be a time-based entry, such as London Open for GBP/EUR pairs (maybe 2am-6am EST), and NY Open for USD pairs. (7am-12pm maybe?), and Asia as well.

Test run: EUR/USD on M15 from 2014-07-07 to 2014-11-08 with basic settings in MGH EA_v4.2 where 2 settings were changed:BaseLot=1.35 Basket_TakeProfit=500 Testing means to me finding its boundaries ans see what they reveal. Technically it all works perfect and I put my hat off to SwingMan for his coding capabilities !!

This test went into crash a couple of days before the end of test period. Here are the overall Balance movements :

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Many batches close sooner then in previous test which makes me wonder how the decision to close-all is organized. Is there anywhere a flow-chart of this EA?

Here happened the crash:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Remarks:more than one Buy on the same grid line -> not needed (same for Sells) no extra trades needed between top & bottom of a particular grid range once both were set before (B at top & S at bottom) lot sizes go very high, this cannot be the correct strategy where 1.35 goes to 840.78 it means that 0.01 lots would go to 6.23 (I think .. not sure) nice profits on the close-all I have some ideas how to make this better but I would need a logic-flow-chart first.

One thing is for sure: always start a new series with trades #1 and #2 hedged at open.

cheers & happy trading

Hi Paracelsus,

@vaper has an interesting art to backtest..., but on two of his ideas I also used to think:
- more than one Buy on the same grid line -> not needed (same for Sells)
- no extra trades needed between top & bottom of a particular grid range once both were set before (B at top & S at bottom)

When I have time I will test a little change of the grid construction, as example:

- Batch1 is sell (level 100 and 110), Batch2 is buy (level 120 and 110)

- For a new sell Batch3, instead to take the same levels as Batch1 (100, 110), take a lower level (90, 100)

- For a new buy Batch4, instead to take the same levels as Batch2 (120, 110), take a higher level (130, 120)

I havent calculate the values, but I think that the shifted levels reduce the lots amount.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
This is my backtest 2years with EUR/USD.... I've change grid range to 20 (only way to survive) ... DD is to high... but...hope for new development...

Thanks

@cescof  Hello, nice testing, tnx. Would you also show the graph please?

How different is it when you set Basket_TakeProfit = 15 or 50 or 100 ?

cheers

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Here is an idea about the first batch only. It would need separate treatment then all others.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In this example the market is going up. Everything should be mirrored if the market moves the other way.

First batch opens with hedge-1 (B1 & S1) on start-grid and hedge-2 (B2 & S2) on next grid. Startlots is from the setting and the 2nd lots is double of the first. The method is wait until either both buys go in TP OR both sells go in TP. Then it is as noted in the picture.

Comments plz ?

cheers

edit: this way there is first 2 TP's and then either next 2 tp's if market turns before reaching next grid or there is a full hedge with the 2 sells and 1 buy. That buy would have lots = L1 + L2 to make a full hedge. From then on it doesn't make any difference where the market goes and how far away .. the DD value of the hedge will stay the same and is a good measure to work the next batches.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Hy... above the 2 charts.. Firs is with basket tp set to 50....and second is the original with basket tp set to 0

--- 帖子 #951 ---
@cescof thanks mate, it seems you have the same effects as I have: with a basket-tp > 0 some batches close sooner then with tp=0 and thus the spikes in the chart are smaller (less DD).

On the other hand when baskets are not closed earlier, they build up trade upon trade (see my remarks earlier) until the strategy goes into crash ! Its good to see that this is not depending on the broker or history data.

The system is simply trading too many times on the same grid-lines. Tnx for testing , cheers!

--- 帖子 #952 ---
I think this is a very good solution to prevent batch accumulate when the price comes into range, especially at low volume days ...

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Why not work on something that you know isnt guaranteed to fail someday?  I encourage you to watch what price and price alone is doing.  This has been the holy grail of trading for me.  For example, if you see an uptrend in place and price keeps hitting a certain level with higher lows...you know with certainty buyers are trying to pile in and you are probably going to have a significant breakout very soon.  Or is price making new highs and higher lows after a significant move down?  Price really does tell everything and theres really no need to martingale if you can win 70-80% of your trades.  Good luck.

The largest buy is at 1,000 lots !! and largest sell at 622.8 lots !!

Details:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What I could observe is that many times the position goes into profit, long before the goal is reached. In this test the running P/L went to +300 to +500 easily. Suggestion : trail the position once a certain positive P/L is reached.

Let's find out how we can solve this problem of grids with many trades.

Happy Trading

cheers

edit:
Total Position:Top line :

5 BUY @ lots (2.80 + 10.80 + 54.70 + 276.80 + 1000.00) -> Equals BUY @ 1345.10 lots . Middle line :

4 BUY @ lots (0.60 + 3.20 + 16.40 +83.00) -> Equals BUY @ 103.20 lots

5 SELL @ lots (0.50 + 1.40 + 7.30 + 36.90 + 186.80) -> Equals SELL @ 232.90 lots Bottom line :

5 SELL @ lots (1.00 + 4.80 + 24.30 + 123.00 + 622.80) -> Equals SELL @ 775.90 lots vaper

I have to assume that there was something wrong with the EA used for this test, as according to the original algorithm there should have been only 3 (or 2) open trades in one direction. On the screenshot 19 trades are closed at once...

--- 帖子 #957 ---
The point is that all those lots eat each other instead of making profits or even progress.

The test is good, the EA worked properly on the test.

This was the v4. 2(.1) version, I think.

In this version if we reduce the number of max  trades, the EA can't open enough positions to be able to close everything in porfit.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
No, the probelm is not "the grid on the same line". What's more: it is a very good idea, much more better than the other  (previous) versions!

The previous versions weren't able to close its previous trades when the price moved for a long time in one direction. The balance was grown but the equity was reduced.

With these settings the test passed with profit in 4 months = 10.4 %.

Profit factor = 1.11 is too low because of all those extra trades on the same lines.

hi all,

apologies but can i check regarding the original strategy posted by kfx?

how do you handle a situation where the inside grid is triggered, but it did not complete the course upwards to clear the initial outside grid. thus resulting to something similiar as below:

3 x 1 buy
3 x 2 sell
3 x 4 buy

and subsequently, it just continue to trend downwards.. with that scenario, u would then be opening 0.8 sell orders. but the 3 x 1 and 3 x 4, would be a total of 1.5 buy in the opposite side.

also, in the same scenario, when would u restart inside grid again?.. based on the lowest 0.4 buy order and highest 0.8 sell order?

or should i implement a stop out for this unfortunate set up since it is likely to put the account into losses rather than profit?

thanks for your time in replying this!

--- 帖子 #962 ---
@belgeran

Hi , for the very original method you could read from post #1 to here. @Kfx was doing a good job together with all who helped along until .. well, you will read that.

He did have some scenario pics (don't know the posts) where you can study his intentions and of course in post #1 .

Personally I am testing all the time and cannot understand why so many trades are opened on the same grid line over & over again. This cannot be the correct way. So, if you have good idea's about how to change the progression of the baskets and the trades in it, we (all who liked Kfx methods) can try to change that, maybe even with the help of @SwingMan who is a seasoned coder.

My idea is that every batch (basket) should go into a separate full hedge when going the wrong way after a certain number of trade entry's. That way every basket becomes an object in itself with a object-DD. Next basket would start with a slight higher lot size good enough to take one or more hedged ones along to profit-all or zero-all. If you have seen my tests then you noticed that trades go to many hundreds of lots which is absurd.

Your idea ?

Happy Trading, cheers

--- 帖子 #963 ---
hi vaper,

thanks for the reply. his post #1 didn't have that scenario covered, but nonetheless.... i have coded an EA that runs specifically to his trading methodology. now back testing it.

in regards to your idea of not having so many trades opening on the same grid lines.... in kfx's original method, his hedging orders will cover the same grid line and it happens in my EA as well. I tried swingman's EA but i felt it had differed from kfx's original method so i gave it a miss.

my feel, is that kfx's method works, but i may need to reduce the baselot to increase account survival chances and probably diversify to trade other pairs at the same time. it remains to be seen if that would actually work as well, since a large base is needed for a martingale hedging account. just testing on eurusd takes 50% drawdown.

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Hi belgeran , good work man. I 'd like to do some tests too, can you send the ea plz?

And look at my former post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...12#post7893112 where I suggest to open the first basket with hedged trades.

Happy Testing!

--- 帖子 #965 ---
I have always wondered about the propriety of re-doing grid levels once they are filled, which would result in weight  being placed at one particular level.  Naturally, in a strong trend, this won't make much difference in the long run, but in the short run could result in large drawdown if price corrects and moves against your position.

My testing MGH, with 100e acount, is working good..

--- 帖子 #967 ---
it is good actually, until a very strong trend hits it all the way. e.g. the USD/JPY jump from 106 up to 113 etc.

the weakness of this strategy lies in the point where it doesn't ride on winning trades but hold onto losing trades... as long as market does some form of consolidation, you will probably come out unscathed, but if the market rides strongly, u will be carrying bigger losing trades compared to the winning trades.

my testing of the EA in EUR/USD and USD/JPY, both resulted in account bankrupt.

saying that, i was doing a 0.1 baselot on a 10k account.... using 0.01 works fine though.... hits up to 128x.

Technically perfect but those chain-trades will not be accepted on a real account . . the market was way too volatile on that event. And if some trades would be accepted it would be with large slippage.

Q: suppose these entries on a grid-line : Sell @ 56-lots and Buy @ 32 lots and a new trade is to be entered. Is it not possible to close those 2 mentioned for 30 lots both sides? The difference of 24 lots would be the same but with Sell @ 26 lots and Buy @ 2 lots. (all numbers are examples)

Could it be calculated just before a new trade on the same line would be entered?

If so, then the lost spread costs could be taken on board of the new trade.

just wondering if that can be done

--- 帖子 #972 ---
I wrote that the trades were live. One can see in my profile.

Because of the rapid high volatility, there are many strange orders against orders in normal volatility.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
sorry SwingMan, I must have missed that! (live on a demo or on a real ?)

Those strange trades are exactly what i meant: some are taken by the server, some are not. And if opened it would be with large slippage. This could be solved by opening only on next candle (always).

But I understand that then sometimes the grid level will be missed, hence no trade at all. It all depends on how it's programmed .. missed a trade -> just go on and wait till next .. or keep trying until trade is opened etc.. there are a lot of logical options to work around unexpected super-volatility.

Since it is an automatic approach, every possible obstacle must be dealt with.

Tnx again for making me aware of missing the live part, cheers

Very good idea and work. Thank.

I ran EA on strategy tester. 10 pips grid, EA got stop out on 19/11/2014, may be Fed minute news on Wed, due to 10000 deposit. I change to 50000. EA passed. So, 19/11/2014, M15, would be a outlier case.

I ran 20 pips grid, EA got trouble on 4/9/2014 to 17/9/2014, a long period of small range, last sell lots is 27.68. It is too big from 0.1 lot to 27.68 lot. It is ok for demo running.

I ran 30 pips grid, EA work ok, but, profit is lower that 20 pips one.

Oh ok that makes sense. I had a super small request I don't know if this is easy to do but I had an idea for this ea where it would close 2 hedging trades when floating p&L is positive. That way it never loses! And if the p&L is more and more negative than you can attack with martingale hedge with another 2 trades. Good idea right?

With FIFO would be nice too

ProfitClose - profit in the deposit currency (ie put $ 100 when the total profit nets $ 100, it will be closed)

ProfitStart - Profit for the start of the trawl in the currency of the deposit such as 50 $

TralClose - closes with a decrease in profits such as the same $ 20

profit reached 50, including trawl, profits continued to grow to 60, then rolled back by 20 and all zakryloss at $ 40 profit

otlozhki removed, an alert pops up with a question to continue working? When answering About K - put up again.

Dear Sir ,

How to open and use MGH EA_v4.2.mq4 ?

Thank you very much .

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Hello Swingman,

Great work mate!  I have a couple of requests if you are entertaining any.

1) Adding a Break Even (BE) function (for single, double, and basket)

2) Adding Trailing stop function after BE is activated (for single, double, and basket)

3) Adding a horizontal line that shows exit price for position basket

Thanks,

Merry Christmas & Happy New Year Everyone ...

can you share your settings and pairs?

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Almost similar to this but the guy disappeared. I like Grid Martingale Trading approach

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Amazing...

No setting at all. Only Lot size and magic number

Good results. But same issue like other grid EA's. Cannot survive one price move 130/150+ pips.

Just back test it for May and June 2017 with 5000$ deposit. It will blast.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
This EA is good for ranging market but you cannot let it control your account and stay away stress free. Like other thousands of free Grid EA's available on hundreds of forums, this will blow your account in case of price spike of 130/150+ pips without any retracement. So if anyone going to try this on real, please know your limits first by trying on demo and also you must be good to smell when volatility is coming. Just having list of red news and avoiding those days is not enough. My account was blown away on a day when there was no major news in entire week. So be cautious.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Seems intersecting. However its not opening any order and also display is different in my broker. Anyone else tried this?

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Indeed. Maybe the best way is to increase the grid size

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
but no setting available at all in this EA and this is ex4 file.

Even you increase grid gap, you can never avoid blast

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Hi SwingMan,

Tested this system and same like other hundreds of martingales EA, it cannot survive 350+ pips movement.

I wish a martingale hedging grid system which can survive 1000+ pips move with balance of 3000 $ only

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I also wish that, but you have to invest time because there are some good ideas and possibilities.
But one should not have too great expectations, because, for example, an excellent member here in forum (@hanover) has turned off his hedging investigations.

I am still investing my time mate.

Hi Kashif

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Can you please PM me your broker name and demo account number?

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Sorry - no.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
I double checked,

Its working fine on all demo accounts in FxPro, XM, FSB, IC Markets. Maybe your history data is from REAL server. Anyhow, no issue, I am not here to sell anything.

Brother, you shared BT test of some other EA. Not what I shared

Hi Kashi

Could you add a option that ea only open and close trades in a pecific time interval?

Example: Updateinterval: 480 mins

As example: I start EA. One buy 0.01 lot and one sell 0.01 lot order is open. Tp is at 50 pips.

8 Hours later price goes up 80 pips: buy order get closed with 80 pips profit. A new sell order 0.02 will be opened.

Then again 8 hours later price goes down 100 pips. sell orders get closed. no trades opened.

Again 8 hours later: Ea opens again one buy and one sell order .....

Would be nice if you can add this Feature.

Sorry for my bad English.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Dear Adelzadeh, this is interesting and what I'm looking for. Would you mind to share the source code ?. One minor tweak required is on the buttons. It's difficult to differentiate between when it is trigger (ON or OFF) status. Secondly, the setting reset to default after sometime. Thus I need to get the source code in order to modify the setting as per our values. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
this kind of EA good on EU and EG pair only..

i hav my own MGH EA...till now still profitable ..loss/ profit..overall +ve every day..

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Maybe I can revive this one.

Is there a good programmer here, that can help with a few tweaks?

Example: My broker only limit up to lots size 9.0... obviously this EA doesn't respect this.

Another thing is that the EA closes automatically the positions at some point, can this be turned off? I prefer to close the trades myself (sometimes I will hedge with a couple of lots big enough to stay alive for a little longer).

Thanks,
