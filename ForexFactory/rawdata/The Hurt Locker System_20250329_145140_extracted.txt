Attached Image (click to enlarge) Inserted Video Hello Traders , today I want to share a powerful and profitable system. Sorry for my bad English , my native language is Chinese.I'll use the simple way to talk about this system. All you need in this system is Patient . Like the Hurt Locker . If you got patient,you'll got be save in this money game. If not,you'll lose your money in this game. So,here's the points about this system: 1.Wait for signal 3 2.Candle color 3.Wait for sup&amp;dem 4.Wait for stoch cross SUGGEST! LESS SPREAD FOR MORE PROFIT CHANCE. If you follow these four points,you can get success for more than 90%. ENTRY FOR LONG: Signal blue 3 appear + blue candle + blue supdem + K corss D. ENTRY FOR SHORT: Signal red 3 appear + red candle + gold supdem + K cross D. Support + blue candle + oversold = BUY Resistant + red candle + overbuy = SELL NOTICE: If SUPDEM is too close,don't trade at the chance. I'll start for a 10000 demo account for this system.Let's see how it can be. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Tai, Looking very promising. Can you provide more information. Also your indicators which you are using for this system. What are the exit point and which time frame you are using it? Once again thank you for the system. Bomi

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi Bomi,thanks for your reply. This system is based on Tow support and resisitant: 3 zz semafor and supdem. And confirm the right (Attack) ENTRY is based on stoch and candle color. Traders can use this system in all TF and charts. Attached are indi and tpl.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
as I know 3 level zz semafor indi repaints... how long have you been trading with the system? any results? also where do you place TP and SL ?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This system has been famous in Taiwan for a while, but the company bound their indi with their broker, so I use the similar indi as theirs. I know that 3 semafor is repaints,but we can combine other indi for right entry point. For this system,i only exit when 2 appear, no sl. In your opinion, no sl is a wrong system,but follow the four point , we can get more profit and less lose.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
In this chart,signal 3 appear,blue supdem appear, stoch under 20 and wait for cross, the only we have to wait is the blue candle appear.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Tai, Thanks for prompt reply. I will definitely try it and will let you know. Usually what time frame you are using or what time has best results? Bomi

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi How do you take profit?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I only exit when 2 appear.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Maybe we can find an EA like oneclicktrading.So we can do backtesting.This sys can use on all TF, but i like to use in H1 or longer, so that we can prevent more repaint problem.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Tai, I seldomly reply to posts but you certainly have my attention on this one. I will be following with keen interest. Regards

--- 帖子 #12 ---
How can you say its powerful and profitable? You have just started 10000 demo account that means you havent tried yet.Thanks for sharing though.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi mario777, first at all thanks for your repy, As I said in this thread,this sys has been used in Taiwan for servel years, many people get profits from this, but this sys's indi were bound by their brokers, I just try to find the same indi and share this perfect sys to you all ^^ by the way,target today's entry.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
i see. ok. thanks for your effort. Good luck and hope for your success!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank for the system. I use it for entry in 15 minute chart. I took a trend in 4 hour chart. 4 hr chart: - MTF Fisher(14) bar is Red --------- DOWNTREND - MTF Fisher(14) bar is Green --------- UPTREND If the trend established is down then I go to 15 minute chart looking to only Sell. The sell trade must all confirm by indicators. (see picture) The MTF Fisher is repaint. But we take a trade when all indicators are confirmed. Please install those indicators attached below For ( Heiken Ashi.mq4 , SupDem.ex4 ) indicators ----- you can download from post3 above. Good luck

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi sriloba,that's all I want to mean in this system. If there's only one indi,entry is lose money. If there's three indi for right signal,we can get profit for 90%.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi fellows traders, I have a big problem in taking profit. Please help me. With this strategy, we can catch a lot of pips. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
If you want to take big profit , how about watch longer Timeframe.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Indicators setting in 15minute chart. window1: stoch(13,5,8) window2: MTF Fisher(14) setting for 4hr chart ---Trend window3: MTF Fisher(14) setting for 1hr chart ---Trend window4: MTF Fisher(14) setting for 15min chart ---Trend window5: Market Emotion(7) for additional confirmation window6: Cycle Identifier for extreme point or turning point

--- 帖子 #20 ---
My original intention is make this system easier and profitable. If we want to follow too many entry signal , maybe we'll lose the chance. Very simple and easy entry , four rules , for all time frame but longer for better. 1. Supdem 2. Candle color 3. Signal 3 4. Stoch cross 3+double blue+cross 20 = BUY 3+yellow red +cross 80 = SELL

--- 帖子 #21 ---
BTW. Hurt Locker Is a great Movie lol

REENTER A TRADE WHEN POINT3 IS NOT CONFIRMED BY ALL INDICATORS. WE REENTER A TRADE WHEN THE NEXT POINT IS CONFIRMED BY ALL INDICATORS. 1- Price pattern 1-2-3 up trend (see picture)

REENTER A TRADE WHEN POINT3 IS NOT CONFIRMED BY ALL INDICATORS. WE REENTER A TRADE WHEN THE NEXT POINT IS CONFIRMED BY ALL INDICATORS. 2- Price pattern 1-2-3 down trend (see picture) Have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Do you put your SL behind the supdem zone or last H/L? Could be essential, look at your USDCAD example: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I didn't set sl in all trade. AIM -&gt; ATTACK -&gt; TARGET!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hard to do backtest coz repaint but i believe this system will make profit Need to foward test about 2-3 month ThanYou for your system

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Have 90% winning but no SL if we meet 10% chance to lose that meaning the accout will fly to the MOON

--- 帖子 #28 ---
For me I put my SL at the most recent swing point. I take profit at the level 00 or 50 if price fells to clean break to those levels (00-50).

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Here I want to show you one of Taiwan trader trade today. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Nice Trade !!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Very Nice! Why both open 7 last orders (audusd)? Why not one?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yes, nice trade, but as I see it wasn't exactly by the rules, am I right? there was no closed red candle yet and no stoch cross yet... is it ok to enter with the red bar and stoch cross in process or we must wait for bar close? Regards

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Good Day Tai, Please explain the 3_level ZZ_Semafor indicator. I would like know what makes the numbers 1,2,3 to be plotted. Thank you so much. Shane

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi shane1, you can throw three zigzag indi in the chart and the parameter are 5,13,34,you can know how it did.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
AIM ATTACK PROFIT.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Maybe they have their own trade way,but wait for all signal appear is save.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I put this on the H4. If I only exit when I get a Stoc crossover after the 3 appears, it is a lot of money per trade. Of course there will be fluxuations in price until the next 3 and Stoc cross appears, but the profit is terrific. You will just have to ride the ups and downs until the next signal.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Any way we can set an alert for when the signals appear so don't need to look at the screen,?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Well looks, awesome. When Big 3 appears you get 100's of pips. it looks great now because market is closed i will test it in demo account maybe helpful. thanks for sharing. i will post results. Subscribed

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks for you all reply, this is a wonderful sys in Taiwan for long time.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
tai9127, what are the right settings of Stoch? In your first picture u use 28,5,5.. Tnak you

--- 帖子 #42 ---
My suggest is exit when signal 2 appear.We have to avoid the signal 3 turns other side.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I use 28,5,5 but you can also use 13,8,5Just test it until the trend like the stoch's trend.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Is these dots are a semafor's 3, without disapearing on new high/low. If it, can you share it? :}

--- 帖子 #45 ---
dot 1 will become 2 , dot 2 will become 3 , dot 3 will repaint.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Here is possible Long on gbpusd i think, will see... @tai9127, do you recommend any specific rules? Sessions, trading days or specefic pairs? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
don't trade THAT DAY if there's news of that pair.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
hi tai thanks for ur posting this hurt locker system. i just post chart in my view in 4 hr . could u please tell me is this SUPDEM indi repaints? if its not repaint, i think my post should helpful for traders. i will update the template later. thanks

--- 帖子 #49 ---
All the indicators "repaint" you need to run it on forward test to see how it react. Try run it in the backtester to get a feel of it. Try this and show us your skills. Have some trading "fun" hehe... http://www.fxblue.com/appstore/app.a...ort=popularity

--- 帖子 #50 ---
If signal 3 break through supdem, there will be a new one.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Very nice system you have got here. Thanks for sharing, but 3 level \semafor is a bad indicator for trading.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
update: Increase stoch cross alert. period : 28,5,5 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #53 ---
He use it to make sure the swing is new low/high. You cant use it to look back at charts but to look forward. No problem it curve fit...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I don't think Heiken Ashi repaints after candle closes --SO if you wait for the 3 semafor and you get a heiken ashi candle color change then chances for profit are pretty good -- sometimes will be small profit sometimes very large. Trades have to be monitored. TAI I like your system and I agree that it only needs the few indicators you showed in page 1. Good luck and good trading.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I completely agree with you. The system is promising with less indicators. I use this system most of the time in 1hr chart. Sometime, I use 30 minute chart for pinpoint. Good luck and have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
UPDATE FOR NEW IDEA: Trade Daily chart and get some swap profit. Follow the rules in this thread and make the Entry. Exit the trade when signal 1 appear. That's a BIG PROFIT. Beware your money management.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
nice system goodluck brother..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
thanks tai for this very nice system ........ i want to ask if the stoch must be below or over 20 ....... thanks for your help magdy

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Ok, i started with one experimental long with gbp/usd. Here is the chart.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
The MTF_fisher needs Fisher_Yur4ik.ex4 to work. Also I modify MTF fisher a little bit to show the timeframe also.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thank you, kmcoo, for correcting the problem. Good luck for trading.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thanks for the thread. I am studying with interest... trying out stoch with setting 14,5,5. It resembles the TDI if you compare the 2. Will restrict only to daily and weekly. Looking for suggestions to better exit rules.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Tzolov, May I know which semafor you are using?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
In the Forex investment club that I am a member of (Forex Los Angeles) we have developed a very similar system over the past two years. We didn't know that folks in Taiwan were using a system that so closely resembled ours. I guess it is a case of parallel evolution. We distribute this to our members and anyone else who asks, so I'll attach a copy of our version. We do like to give credit to those who develop and code the indicators we find useful. SupDem was created by "Bredin," based on the work of Sam Sieden. It attempts to automate finding Support and Demand levels based on past chart patterns. The 3 level ZZ semaphore was mostly written and perfected by "The Rumpled One." It attempts to define the top and bottom of price swings and as such it will repaint as many times as necessary to find a real top or bottom. Good indicator, but not reliable to trade on its own. The attached screenshot shows a recent trade on the EUR/JPY, with entry and exit marked. This is a 15 minute chart and the trade was entered on July 9 th at 14:30 GMT. Trade was open for almost exactly one day and netted 124 pips. Dick

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Sure. Using 3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_TRO_MODIFIED_VERSION, you can change symbols, i'll post a map. Also it has alerts.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
can you please explain more about this one . thanks

--- 帖子 #68 ---

nice down trade. Beware of exit point,D1 is for up trade.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Tai, can you give a sample screenshot when it is too close so we can avoid it? Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Like this one, supdem is too close, they may break easily and break our entry rules.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
We can call supdem as "Wall" You need a strong (Thick) wall.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
hi, how many pips is too close? Because zoom in/out can affect the perception of distance. Is there a setting to disable the unnecessary thin/small bars?

My setup is somewhat similar to your system, you think about this short....!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
This system is shit. I have been placing the exact opposite trades and made a good deal of money.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I think you call hold your way about trade, but if you call this sys is shit, are you a shit man watch a shit sys?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
You have an appalling attitude and your ignorance is disgusting with such a blatant post like that. If you placed opposite trades and made a 'good deal of money', shouldn't you be thanking the OP? Ignorance at it's finest indeed. I for one used a (similar) method and have banked 50 pips over today and yesterday on my live account - so perhaps it's not the trading method but the trader.

Is Buy NZDUSD on M15 Valid?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
M1~M30 is too repainted.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Ok, Thanks! So only H1 and Higher!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Yes,and follow the rules and MM.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
how many trades do you make/day?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
There's many chance a day, BUT you have to avoid the NEWS! I make some notes about CPI PPI GDP etc.. BIG NEWS.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Let's see how it go. 1.signal 2 then wait for red candle. 2.keep going and break signal then wait red candle.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
do you wait for candle close (entry, exit)?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Entry when four rules. Exit when signal 1 or 2 appear.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
So you have always look to the screen, or do you have any alerts ? Is it important which of the four signals comes first ?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
you can change 3 zz semafor alert from false to true.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
NZDUSD H1 Buy Valid?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
tai9127, how many pairs do you trade ?

There's many chance a day, BUT you have to avoid the NEWS!

Hello Dick, Very interesting chart. What has drawn me to this thread is that I use SupDem in a similar way, however, with MAs and a MACD as confirmation of the new trend. The MRN Trend Changer with Super X on your chart is very intriguing, how is this indicator used in providing confirmation of a trend change? Many thanks. Alan

Actually wanted to post this one (moveable around main chart...):

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Tai, i dont normally post comments easily, but you have got my attention on this system,looks very promising. ive tested yest on a few pairs with a good result. i like the simplicity of this system.will need more fine tuning on the stoch setting, just a few question on your exit, do u out a fixed SL or you manually exit after number 2 appearing?.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Tai,can u post ur new chart.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Nice chart, share please.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Wouldn't it be advisible to wait for a move away from the supply/demand zone and only enter a trade according the rules @ retouch of the fresh zone? One could even take trades only @ strong zones from where price moved fast (Sam Seiden).

--- 帖子 #127 ---
You got a not bad systems here, narrow down the best pairs and stick to them. Don't go off chasing some crap. Lets see how it goes with the best tested handfull not some poke in the dark.

thanks, do you know if it repaints? (the change'' indi)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi everyone Try this I think you will like..... Set you 3 level semafor to Period 1 to 0 (worthless) Period 2 to 34 (old setting for the 3) Period 3 to 68 (double old #3) This will give better signals in better over bought and sold areas. Next set your Sup/dem to 240 min forced tf Then use your best setup with it. This will give you trades you can make good pips on. Have fun Tom

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Yes, The CHANGE Indi Repaints!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Jep , absolutely correct , Semaphor starts from H4 working fine !

--- 帖子 #143 ---

I really hope this thread ends not like other threads , where people mess the charts with filters , indicators and fancy stuff. Guys , keep it simple ! If you re looking for a thread , where every week a " better " system is updated , here it is : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=470225 Eitan develops great systems , but we all wanna make some stable profits , so we better stick to ONE system . If you are always jumping around to add a new indi .. and stuff .. you will not trade stable . You have 50 or more charts , where you can trade .. please don´t destroy this simple kind of trading .. All you need is green pips .. that´s it ! Thank you tai9127 for sharing this simple working system ! Guido

fx factory is for teaching and learning,you didnt get my poin... I dont want to destroy anything! Hurt Locker System you can forget in 1H chart taths fact!!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
No filter necessary! Supdem just shows an engulfing pattern. Better to wait for a retrace ro the level and wait for a signal.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
semafor starts working well from h4 .. as I wrote an hour ago ..The semafor is nothing else than a highet high or lower low indi .. in combination of s and d it works good .. The heiken ashi is just for those who can t read a change ..so keep it simple .. you don t need more ..

I completely agree with you. The Hurt Locker system doesn't need more indicators. Because trading in 4 hour chart is enough accurated. Good luck trading.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
hey guys, i know many of you guys trying to help fellow traders here, but try to keep the trading system as simple as possible,putting too many indies will only doubt your entry,this system is already very good system provided you know how to see the price reacting at certain level , so lets not cluster the chart with many indies pls.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I completely agree with you. The Hurt Locker system doesn't need more indicators. 4hour char : 1-semafor 2-Heiken Ashi 3-SupDem 4-stoch Trading in 4 hour chart is enough accurated. Good luck trading.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I agre there is 2 ways to trade in 1 H but confirm in 4H charts direction, or trading direct in 4 H

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Agree!!!! One more good thing trading 4H is it doesn't take much of time to monitor. But can be a bit tricky if 10 or more pairs..

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Long ChfJpy in 4hr chart I use only the tools of Hurt Locker system. But I want to see candlesticks pattern not heiken ashi. So I put heiken ashi in histogram in indicator window and stoch crossing on price window.

Thanks you all love this system, as I say in this thread, this system has been provened that can be profitable in my country for long time. Wish you all green pips and make more discuss about this system.

GBP/JPY...!?

With the GbpJpy, I like to enter a trade after the small candle signal. Because GbpJpy retraces deeply. I don't want to suffer from retracement. My daily goal is to make 20 pips with full lots.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
on 4H charts and JPY pairs you will make more than 20 pips daily Im sure....

Hi guys, I am joining this tread, by the way i have a question. Talking about the STO, do we always wait for the blue to cross 80/20 line ? Or do we take the trade if the blue line has cross the red line. Like on the picture.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
My long trade on ChfJpy is closed +6 pips. Because soon NY session starts with news of Canada. Also stochastic is still sitting in the over sold area.

- Stoch(28,5,5) from your metatrader platform Sorry for late reply.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi fellows traders, I give you an AutoFibTradeZone indicator for helping your analysis. You can try it. 1- The zone in red is overbought --- Be careful when you go long in this area. 2- The zone in blue is oversold --- Be careful when you go short in this area.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
When the semafor signal appears in the zone of over bought the stoch is over bought. This means that the signal is solid. All we have to do is waiting the set up of the hurt locker system. We can see clearly in the chart below.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Below is the example of short trade when all indicators are confirmed in the same time. N.B. Trend Slope indicator sets to 20

--- 帖子 #182 ---
thanks, what is your semafor settings? just standard or..?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Only 34 in periode 3 and the rests are null. The semafor (34) is the only signal that we have to follow.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi, sriloba, Can u give Trend_Slope.ex4 some more details or source code? I want to learn it deeply, Thanks.

Before trading for the day, I do a scan of the markets looking for the best set up. The things, I want to see when I scan the markets : 4 hour chart 1 - Semafor signal --- semafor(34) is forming 2 - SupDem --- is forming 3 -AutoFibTradeZone --- Price trade in the OB/OS area ? 4 -Stochastic --- OB/OS area ? Once the market is trading with the 4 points above, I will stick to that pair. Good luck, guys.

How I reenter a trade after the retracement on 4 hour chart. 4hr chart : i- semafor(34) appeared then price flows in the direction of the semafor (34) signal ---- white arrow ( see chart below) then price retraces ------ yellow arrow -- and forms semafor (13) signal ( see chart below) ii- After semafor(13) signal is formed then GO TO 1HOUR CHART TO TRADE ( see chart below) iii- Finally apply the set up of the hurt locker system to make a trade - semafor (34) is formed - SupDem is formed - Stoch(28,5,5) cross - Heiken Ashi is confirmed Hoping this will help.

Every day, I will post my chart of trading. I am doing this only just to help people to survive in the forex world. I start learning forex since 2006 during 5 years but no good results. I lost more than I won. Bacause I trade in a lower time frame. There are a lot of noises. In the last 3 years, I trade semafor system in higher time frame but without SupDem indicator but I use other tools like psychological numbers and price patterns. It gave me good results. But, when, I use SupDem indicator in this thread with the minimum indicators then my trading is more powerful then ever. Now, I trade only on 4hr chart and trade on 1hr chart only for reentering a trade. My daily goal is gaining 20 pips with full lots. If the market is generous I will get more then 20 pips. I do only a trade per day. Then enjoy life. Thanks, tai9127, for the system. Now, I'm trying to help others.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
my goal is just 10 pips, will this system give 20 daily pips on 4HR ?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Are you kidding me, santos23. Trading in 4hr or 1hr chart, if you do properly your daily forex analysis you will get more then 20 pips in 95% of the time. IMPORTANT : Timing enter a trade is very crucial for early green pips.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I'd been blew up my live account a lot of times by trading lower time frame. But you will win some trades but you will lose most of the time. Because semafor repainted a lot. My wisdom advice to you is trading higher time frame from 1hr and above.

Today, in my radar, 2 pairs are trading with the 4 points : 4hour chart 1 - Semafor signal --- semafor(34) is forming 2 - SupDem --- is forming 3 -AutoFibTradeZone --- Price trade in the OB/OS area ? 4 -Stochastic --- OB/OS area ? Confirm the 4 points above : I) EurAud: 1 - Semafor signal --- semafor(34) is forming 2 - SupDem --- is forming 3 -AutoFibTradeZone --- Price trade in the OS 4 -Stochastic --- OB/OS area ? II) ChfJpy: 1 - Semafor signal --- semafor(34) is forming 2 - SupDem --- is forming 3 -AutoFibTradeZone --- Price trade in the OS 4 -Stochastic --- OS area

I want to remind 2 elements cores in the Hurt Locker system. Quote: We do like to give credit to those who develop and code the indicators we find useful. SupDem was created by "Bredin," based on the work of Sam Sieden. It attempts to automate finding Support and Demand levels based on past chart patterns. The 3 level ZZ semaphore was mostly written and perfected by "The Rumpled One." It attempts to define the top and bottom of price swings and as such it will repaint as many times as necessary to find a real top or bottom. Good indicator, but not reliable to trade on its own. See post#65 Also I want to remind that only the strong can survive in the arena of forex.

Soon, I will give you my pinpoint technic based on price patterns reversal in lower time frame once the signal in HTF (4hr chart) is formed with the 4 points (post#185). We have 2 possibilities to enter a trade : 1) With indicators in current time frame or 2) Price patterns reversal formed in LTF (1-2-3 reversal, divergence, TL break, etc...) Stay tune! Now, I'm going to take a fresh air in a park.

Hi! fellows traders, How to pinpoint an entry once the signal (semafor34) is formed in 4hr chart with 4 criterias (see post#185) ? -- With price patterns formed in LTF -- (15 min chart) See charts below: 4hr chart : Market: 1 - Semafor signal --- semafor(34) is forming 2 - SupDem --- is forming 3 -AutoFibTradeZone --- Price trade in the OB 4 -Stochastic --- OB area :nerd:CRANK DOWN TO 15min CHART -- We have a DIVERGENCE (When traded properly, you can be consistently profitable with divergences. The best thing about divergences is that you’re usually buying near the bottom or selling near the top. This makes the risk on your trades are very small relative to your potential reward.) ***** Read more: http://www.babypips.com/school/high-...#ixzz3835GcBbm Then apply the rule of the hurt locker system. BTW, I like a divergence then others price patterns reversal when I pinpoint an entry because ***** . We can apply others price patterns reversal like 123 reversal, TL break, etc...) to pinpoint an entry. For me, DIVERGENCE, is the best

Hi guys, I have a problem about using the supdem-indicator. I watched the video in post#1 and noticed, tai entered the short just shortly after the supdem indicator has drawn a fresh supply zone at the actual swing. So my problem is, classic supply&amp;demand trading is done by waiting for the price enters a zone that has been build by an older swing in the past. But I also see some chart with trades that use the classic way. So my question is, is the trade in that video a valid setup or not? Thanks so much, Chris

Today, there are not majors news. The market is low volatile. Be careful trading on Monday. Using ½ of full lot to make a trade like I'm doing now. Example, you use $30 per pip to trade a full lot ----½ lot = $15 per pip.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Use simple system to trade forex like the Hurt Locker system. Forex is a business of probability and confluent. 1- Probability : Most people trade with emotions - They heard news from others to decide a trade or lack of minimum of understanding forex, etc... We analyse the market by using past datas to project the move of the future. Maybe that analysis is right or wrong. No system is perfect. That why we have to use money management wisely. 2- Confluent : Use some tools of forex to confirm a trade. First the news create the direction of price and the technic analysis is how we enter a trade. All indicators are lagging. But we need this lagging indicators to confirm a signal. Trying to trade top or bottom is suicided. We have to sacrifice some pips to make pips. Knowing the key levels of R/S is a key of success in trading. That why I like SupDem and Semafor indicators. When use them wisely is a golden technic analysis.

If you know how to trade bt this system, the last two things you have to know is: 1:Control your money management. 2:Trade at small spread chart.

hi tai9127 I've been following your thread with interest, two questions: 1) I'm using a spread betting account AUDNZD the spread is 10 points ..to me that's a lot, what is your optimum or maximum spread ? 2) I have 15 pairs set up and have been running them for six hours, I have yet to spot a setup, is this unusual? What is your anticipation of trade frequency? It'd be great to have guides to the above, thanks in anticipation...also many thanks for the trouble you have gone to presenting the system

If everything goes as planned we expect Long trade -- green arrow See you soon

I prefer the candle closes before enter a trade. It is a conservative entry and the chance of wins are more than lost. As soon as the hurt locker signals are closed I enter a trade. Signal2 (semafor13) appears because, maybe there is a Top/Bottom at that moment. Price may breach that Top/Bottom and continue its course. Hope this help you

Hi! guys, This Hurt Locker system attempts to trade Top/Bottom which is very good. There are wins and lost trades even we respect all criterias. I use the Hurt Locker differently from the tai9127 to fit my personality. 1- Find a trend in higher time frame -- 4hr chart by using Fisher(21) -- Red bars (after 2nd bar) are downtrend -- Green bars (after 2nd bar) are uptrend . Once the trend is established GOTO 1HR CHART or 30MIN chart (is a borderline) to enter a trade with the Hurt Locker system See char below

Before entering a trade after trend established we have absolutely determine key levels of R/S. The Hurt Locker system provides the key levels of R/S : SupDem and Semafor indicators. Guys, I'm telling you. It is a big + for our trading if we want to survive in the forex world.

Regarding the trend established in 4hr chart. As long as the Fisher bars are not changing color the trend is still valid. Hope all this will help in your next trading.

This is my radar during my trading session. I scan 12 pairs -- 3 pairs in 1 window -1hr and 30min chars N.B. The white arrows in the price window is stochastic crossing signal (28,5,5)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Just a question, you trade on 30 min with 4H direction?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Sorry for very late reply. i) 4hr chart : Determine the trend ii) 1hr or 30min charts : enter a trade according to the direction of 4hr chart. I like taking trend in 4hr chart because the majority of hedges funds enter their positions in 4hr. If big Boys go long on 4hr chart and our system says up trend in 4hr chart then we ride in the same flow of the big Boys.

I watched the video in post#1 and noticed, tai entered the short just shortly after the supdem indicator has drawn a fresh supply zone at the actual swing. So my problem is, classic supply&amp;demand trading is done by waiting for the price enters a zone that has been build by an older swing in the past. But I also see some chart with trades that use the classic way. So my question is, is the trade in that video a valid setup or not? Thanks so much, Chris I have been using SupDem as a vital part of my trading for about 2 years. I have found it to be wildly profitable to take just about any trade whan price moves out of the SupDem box. Yes, sometimes it comes back and retouches, but it frequently just keeps on going. Some of the best trades are found when price just "kisses" the SupDem box and quickly pulls back, leaving just a wick barely in the SupDem. I mostly trade 5 minute charts and pay very little attention to other time frames or long term trends. SupDem is vital for spotting quick turns in the market and highlighting temporary resistance levels. I've compared it with Sam Seiden's original work doing this manually and I think SupDems are just as good, maybe better. In the attached 5 min chart from earlier today, you can see the GBP/NZD clearly touch the blue SupDem boxes three times and continue on up without a retrace. Retraces are great, but I don't wait for them. In this case, two trades were worth 122 pips in an hour and a half. Dick Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I try my best to answer your question which is good. I enter trade when all criterias are confirmed : 1- 4hr chart : Determine the trend 2- 1hr or 30min charts : enter a trade according to the direction of 4hr chart with the rule Hurt Locker system This is the way I enter a trade. (most of the time with price pattern reversal formed) See Chart below N.B. : Signal2 retests the zone of R/S and continue its prevailing trend. I will long at signal2 formed because it is a bullish continuous pattern

hey sriloba i think this trading system is pretty much depend on technical analysis. may i know how much profitable pips u able to collect to apply this system.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I use 2 systems everyday to trade. One system is swing trade ( Hurt Locker system). I trade this system only in 4hr chart. The results are goods. The other system I use is trend following that I had explaining in post#223. I like technical analysis because we can use minimum indicators to trade successfully. My daily goal is producing 20 pips. I can make it in one trade.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
thanks for privious replay bro. i think only 20 pip profit from hurt locker system is very little amount. what u think? i dont think u use any stoploss.. am i right

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I use all the time stoploss. 20 pips is my daily goal. If you trade in 4hr chart you can get more than 20 pips. Sometime I use SL=35 for TP=20. Is it worth? No, but for me it is ok.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Tomthepoppop, Well said, very good point to consider ...thanks. This add in confidence.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Ya its fine if u frequently make profit. because this system is technical analysis base so is that mean u dont care about news. r u getting good result to trade with 1:1 risk and gain ratio.u r a Experienced trader i think u relatade with trading more then 7 year. i would like to get some solution from u

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I don't trade 30-45 minute before new with orange flag and 1hr before new with red flag. If I'm in a trade win or lost I will close my trade 15min before new releases. 1:1 risk ratio, I don't use frequently. My daily goal is 20 pips with full lot. Sometime my SL=40, as soon as my TP=20 pips is reached I close manually my trade. You have to monitor your trade. Don't let your win trade becomes lost trade. First, you must have your system of trading that fits your personality. Because SL and TP depend on your personality, aggressive or conservative. Once, you knew your personality then you built your own system or take the system built by other traders then you tune up to fit your personality like I do. I took the Hurt Locker system and transform it in swing trading and trend following to adapt to my personality. By making your own system that you will go further in the forex trading. Hope this will help you.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
may be i make some coflict with hurt locker system. hurt locker system simply say sell on resistance and buy on support am i right bro? i know this system also require some special instraction to follow before place a trade. but is it simply mean sell in resistance and buy in support. am i right?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
You are absolutely right. The Hurt Locker system is attempting to trade top-bottom or R/S. If the R/S is a key level then you don't have to suffer from price retracement. Money management is very important when using any systems because what we see in price is the emotion of the traders and also the manipulations of the Big Boys. That why 20 pips a day is enough for the dumb money or small traders like us. It is better using this system in HTF (4hr and above) the signal is more solid but SL is large then the one in LTF. That why knowing our personality is big + for the long run. Hope this can help you.

Hi! fellows traders, Today, I give you how to trade the Hurt Locker system by using : 1) 4hr chart : When a signal semafor(34) and SupDem appear Settings: - Semafor(34,13,0) -- visualization check box H4 only - SupDem (set to 240 tf) - Heiken Ashi (HA) - Stoch(28,5,5) GOTO 15min chart to trade 2) 15min chart : Settings: - Semafor(34,0,0)-- visualization check box M15 only - SupDem (set to 240 tf) - Heiken Ashi (HA) - MACD(12,26,9) in MT4 platform - Long Trade : i) Semafor(34) + SupDem + HA + macd histogram is above the signal - Short Trade : i) Semafor(34) + SupDem + HA + macd histogram is below the signal SL = Most recent h/L TP = When signal semafor(13) appear in 4hr chart if you have a gut. See chart below: Exemple SHORT TRADE

no worries , for the 4H- Semafor(34,13,0), change the period 1 to 0 change the period 2 to 13 change the period 3 to the 34, is that right? 15TF same change to, is that right? just want to make sure

--- 帖子 #256 ---

--- 帖子 #260 ---
If we are waiting the semafor and supdem on the four hour chart and then going to the 15min chart to trade, i noticed that you don't mention the stoch crossover in the 4hr but we act on the macd in 15...so what is the purpose of the stoch in the 4 hr chart?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Before I use MA cross over to enter a trade. It lags playing with MA cross but it is more convincing. Now, I use the rule of the hurt locker to enter a trade. This rule helps me to gain the early pips. You can use like TAI the way he enters a trade in HTF. Beause semafor repaints a lot in LTF . The hurt locker system is spotting the turning point in HTF without crank down LTF to pinpoint a trade. But in HTF, SL is large than LTF. Hope this helps you.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
You use Stoch in 4hr chart to trade in HTF as the rule of the hurt locker system says. When all indicators agree you enter a trade . The trend following says once the trend is determined in HTF you go to LTF wait for retracement before trigger. That way, you enter a trade with a good price and SL is small. We can use the rule of the hurt locker system to get a trend in HTF and go down LTF to pinpoint a trade by using the rule of the hurt locker system. It is fine too. Hope this can help in your next trading.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi, everyone, I had checked code of supdem.mq4, inside it, the default parameters of zigzag is period:13, dev:8, backstep:5, just same as 2nd level of 3_zz_semafor, but why using them as 3rd level's R/S ? Any advice? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I think it is better to use AutoFibTradeZone indicator (set 240 period as default). See post#179 for further small explanations.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Very soon I will create my own thread calls : Fishing the Fibs We can not change things in the Hurt Locker system. Stay tune

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Thanks for your reply so quickly, I looked AutoFibTradeZone.mq4, and it looks complicated, let me try to read it all then may ask more questions. But may I ask why u don't use supdem? It too simple(as I found, supdem only check three (current, prev, next) k Line's open/close price)? Thanks again.

HI Traders,I'm using PVA candle to see is there any clue to improve this system.

I haven't posted anything here in years. But while looking at this system, I added grid builder indicator to show the level of 500 and 000, heavy support and resistance, some call it the psych levels. Note that price action hangs around the 250 and 750 level. So as you can see, the trend is down and we only trade in the direction of the trend. We wait til price action hits or comes close (5 pips) to the marked lines of the grid builder (500, 000), wait for the ZZ indicator to show a 3, and we go for the trade in the overall trend. First take profit would be 20-25 pips (minor support and resistance at 250/750 line), second would be 40-50 pips (500 and 000 line). I kept it real simple and hopefully this system won't get over cluttered.

I have noticed that when a new supdem is forming on H4 and at the same time a new supdem is formig on D1, the signal is strong and the winning rate of the trade is probably 90%. We actually have it on Gbp/Usd and Cad/Chf. Thank You.

A fine piece of analysis there Killerpips, please keep us informed of how your real time trading goes with your observations. It appears that SupDem does provide very strong reversal signals on the higher timeframes. Cheers Alan

YES Ragl, A new SupDem is forming on GU at the same time on H4 and D1, I avoid trading when the price is entering into an existing SupDem, So actually, base on H1, i took Long GU and waiting . . .

Long GU was a winning trade according to '' new SupDem on H4 and Daily '' I said that i avoid trading when the price enter in an existing SupDem. Here is a new trade Buy Gbp/Jpy. We have the formation of a new SupDem on H4, the formation of a new SupDem on Daily and a divergence on the STO on H4, I take my Long GJ based on the signal on the H1. Thank You.

Wow.. aren't you longing a little early? Just thinking out loud while looking at sriloba setup. I will wait for the 2 green bars first. Only then I will go to 30 min chart and enter if I see a valid sign. But still would like to read the details of your thoughts. Happy Trades

We all have that and I hate it too.. since I started drinking one or two nice warm glasses of Melissa Tea every day I feel relaxed troughout the day and it helps supporting your patience levels.. but just advice though.. Happy Trades

--- 帖子 #299 ---

Hey Yohan_Ayala, http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...3&amp;d=1406585103 Could i kindly know what indicator is that on your chart? The one with the Blue,Black,red lines Thanks!

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Everybody should aware that is indicator is nothing but a repainting indicator. ( which indicator point 3 2 1 )

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Of course it repaints. That's because it isn't an indicator at all, it is a marker. It marks the high and low points of little moves, medium moves and big moves. Since it isn't magic, it really has no idea of when a move will start or end. Sort of like a "high of the day" marker that expands when a new high is reached. A good test is to take a look at a few charts and see how accurate something is. If it never misses, you know it is adjusting the past to fit current conditions. It is quite a useful tool and I have it on all my charts, but it is a marker, not an indicator of trades. Dick There are two kinds of people: Those who know how to extrapolate from incomplete data

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hey Dick... how do you close your trades on M5... on the next supdem zone or?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I tried to combine this with my strategy and its look very promising this is my first trade and it was closed with +20 pips. thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Looks nice! Mind sharing your strategy? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
If ZZ Semafor is based on the 3 zig zags indicator ... then my understanding is it should not repaint after another 2 candles are closed. Please let me know if I'm correct or not. If we use entry filters and get a good entry 2 candles after the first ZZ Semafor "3" candle ... then we should be ok for entry, right?
