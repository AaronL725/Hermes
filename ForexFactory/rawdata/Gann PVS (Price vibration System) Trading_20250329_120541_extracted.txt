I've been wandering around this forum for a while and been trading for around a year now. Still learning lots of stuff. I like to help others so posting this. I call this the Gann Price vibration system. It is not a system by itself but is more a confirmation system . Add this to whatever method you trade and it will help you for sure. It's based on the gann wheel. From a low you can predict possible points where the market will vibrate to. Same with a high. Price will either bounce off, gap through, or blow through these levels. Thats why I call it a confirmation system. I have attached an excel file in which you input a significant low and a high and it gives you price vibration levels. (remove the decimals when inputing the numbers) eg: 1.4320 would be 14320 Then just add the lines to you mt4 chart and you have areas to watch. Sometimes you may just have a low you can still plot higher levels and predict vibration areas. It works on any timeframe. I personally like to take the daily and draw my lines so I can use them interday for a long time without having to change them. It's also interesting to know that many times price reverses at these levels to the tick. Also note that when there are 2 lines in close proximity the area is stronger. Update 1 Added a video showing how to do it. Sorry for the low quality. Hope you get the idea. Inserted Video Update 2 Updated indicator can be found here thanks to brooky29 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...33#post5389333

Great stuff mate. This stuff u just shared is way better than lagging indicators. U know these levels in advance and u can prepare for them. I hope an indicator can be made for these levels so that it can save time doing the calculations. Am subscribed....keep it coming. Happy trading. Ibuks

Your xls file is protected, I cannot input high or low price in your xls sheet. Could you send another file ? Support resistance is the importance factor in trading, no matter what technique you use to find determine it, Using Gann calculation to predict support and resistance is probably the most popular way. Thanks for share ---------------------- gann indicator

--- 帖子 #4 ---
It works fine here no encryption. where are you inputting the values? It should be in the yellow box below the down from high and up from low box.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
i couldn't use the gann indicator in my mt4,it shows nothing,what mt4 you use?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
This is NOT an indicator. This is an excel spreadsheet where you input the high/low and then it calculates the lines for you. It is up to you to enter the lines manually on the chart.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Subscribed and will follow with interest. But I am frankly unclear on how to use your XL file. A step-by-step example with a chart showing where you get numbers to input and then how to plot the levels would be awesome. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This indicator could help determine the change in M1 http://codebase.mql4.com/5599

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Sorry wrong thread me

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same as Murry Math Lines? I'm not sure how you are calculating your lines on your spreadsheet but I know that Murry Math Lines are based on Gann's formulas. Either way it's good stuff.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hey Moneydeep Thanks for sharing. I never could get into Gann, so it's nice to someone having a crack at it. One question: the way you use the vibration points seems to be like the Fibonacci confluence idea of making extensions, retracements, projections etc. and then looking for areas of confluence; i.e. where several overlap. Is that about right? Cheers!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Yes. In itself Gann lines are great but when you have confluence these lines help enormously. Thats why I mentioned that this is a confirmation system. Just add it to however you trade and watch price action at these levels.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Added a video to the first post. As per teemo's request. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Just went through your Video. Great work Brother! I only trade a small handful of Futures and will back test today. Do you have a favorite TF?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Wish a coder can transform the excel file into a MT4 indicator

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Brilliant....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Downloaded both Gann Indicators from your link. Can't make in work in my trading platform.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I generally trade forex interday so I take highs and lows from the daily so I don't have to draw them too often. Basically when a high/ low that you drew from is taken out you should re-draw

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Moneydeep Thank you for helping me make some sense of Gann.The video really helped. Question:How many lines do you draw from the low column and from the high column?

--- 帖子 #20 ---

--- 帖子 #21 ---
What are you trying to do advertise your website? Firstly You dont say anything just show a chart and link to a non english site. Please refrain from such stuff.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I draw them to the high from the bottom and to the low from the top. That way I get inter day levels.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Amazing thing your excel file..... I wonder if you could give some more detailed explanations about how you builded up the tabs. And why there are 4 columns? thanks in advance...still amazed...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Moneydeep...please dont give up already your Gann lines are too good!... I really hope you go on with this thread... greetings bachiano

--- 帖子 #25 ---
euro nailed the top using yesterdays low to build the levels. wtg gann!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi all. I was intrigued by the calculations that MoneyDeep was using so I knocked up an indicator that would automatically show the first circle lines which seem to be the most used. I have checked it against MoneyDeeps calcs and it appears to be correct. If not the code is exposed and changeable. It is all longhand code because I wrote it as I saw it so if someone wants to loop it, be my guest. Charts below explain how it works, but essentially, when you load the indicator you will see a red vertical control bar under the last candle and some horizontal lines. Just select the start or end of that red line and place it on whatever High or Low you want. The horizontal lines will adjust per MoneyDeeps calculations. ( Assuming I read the spreadsheet correctly :-) You can open a bigger timeframe and use Highs and Lows from it if you want and then back down to a smaller tf without the lines moving. I need to not lose the Red line when you change tf's and the payback for that is that you have to delete this line when unloading the indicator. All other lines etc will unload. Hope this helps. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks a lot for this. I know this thread is dead and gone since I guess no was really interested. I tested the indi and it seems to be looking good for now

--- 帖子 #28 ---
It's great nobody really knows how to use Gann's techniques or else the markets would be destroyed.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi All. I was asked to make the indicator into an Auto version so that one could quickly apply it to many charts consistently at say the high and low of 2 or 3 days ago. Attached is the indicator with this option able to be set. You can still use it manually if you turn UseAutoTfHiLos off, but it is on by default. Inputs are as below. extern bool UseAutoTfHiLos = true; extern int AutoTf2Use = 1440; extern int MtfBarBack = 1; AutoTf2Use obviously needs to bigger than the tf the chart is on and the MtfBarBack option tells the indi which MTF Bar (Day or H4 etc) it should take the levels from. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #30 ---
@brooky: this is incredible work... thanks a lot... zackery

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Brooky, Ur work is highly appreciated. Is it possible to be able to apply 2 instace of the indicator on a chart? I tried it but its seems not to be working. I want to be able to apply it to draw for 3days and then compare it to 5days as an example. Some interesting levels can showup ... thx.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi again. While I don't trade this concept, I am a big believer in Fib confluence and all that. It occurred to me that if you have several copies of the indi on chart with either different MTF bars back or different periods that you would have the benefit of confluence on one chart. The updated indicator allows you to do this by simply putting a different letter in the option extern string IndiCopyOnChart = "a"; Example chart uses 4 copies of the indi called a.b.c and d. They are set at H4, Daily, Weekly and Monthly and all displayed on an M15 chart. For those that understand these levels, I imagine that this is beneficial. Cheers Brooky.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Many thanks buddy, that was fast... Here is a sample of eu with 3days, 5days, 7days. Can u see conflunce? http://screencast.com/t/irQz3BUSI

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello. I have had a chance to tidy up the code and work on the color options. This version should be the last unless some bugs crawl out. You can now properly change colors and styles for different timeframes. Tpl attached of a Multi Timeframe setup with H4, Daily, Weekly and Monthly all on the same chart. Mousing over a line will let you know what Timeframe it belongs to. Lines will readjust as each Timeframe plots a new bar. eg: H4 will readjust once every 4 hours etc. Confluence is instantly visible. It would be nice to see someone come up with the trade strategy now. Thanks to MoneyDeep for the idea. @ MoneyDeep. You may want to put this version on your front post to stop the inevitable newbie, what version should I use questions. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I have a Gann Wheel and had used it quite a lot for futures years ago. Still sits here at my desk. HOWEVER, this software is amazing!! To be able to do the multiple calculations like your indicator does saves valuable time indeed. Well done!!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Although I originally was using this on swings and looking for confluence. This idea of interday highs and lows seems and interesting path to tread on. I really appreciate all the effort people are putting into this.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Well Moneydeep; as you know, we have half of the puzzle done here. We have charted price levels, now the most interesting addition is TIME confluence. When time &amp; price are in confluence, expect a big bang. So, off each high and low, count 45 bars, 90 bars, 180 bars and 360 bars into the future to plot the time cycles. Then watch the fireworks when the major time markers line up with the major price levels...it's uncanny how deadly accurate they can be. Can an time indicator be created to acomplish this?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Excellent suggestion. I can have a look at picking possibly HH and LL each day of the past x days and automate a series of fib timelines that would do this. For the moment because it is probably more accurate visually, you could use the Fib Timelines tool in MT4 set to 0,1,2,4,8 and pull the 0 to 1 line over 45 bars and as you say, watch the magic. I have 2 sets on highs in yellow to indicate they are on highs and 2 on green which are on lows. Pic attached with a circle of where the timeline was started and an arrow to where it was pulled to (45 bars). Indeed the magic appears. Point to note is that both the point 2 longs( current) and shorts (previous) where projected 4 days ago. I think they call that a leading indicator :-) I will have a look at the day high low idea when I get a moment. Cheers Brooky.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I think you are on the right track...however there may be too many lines on the chart to pick from. So I think that the swing highs/lows that your original indicator gets is probably correct... That is how the original Gann Wheel is calculated...Take the recent high and plot 45^ from there to get the price. Then when you count the bars forward from that recent high you arrive at the future bar then plot that. Then you would do the same exercise for the recent swing low.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi The indicator has not changed. It is only a tpl with several instances of the indi to highlight what can be done with it. If you can post a pic of your preferred scenario it would be helpful. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #41 ---
As I write this, we have a cluster at 1.3044. Notice how price touched it almost to the pip. We may have seen the highs in for the day Time will tell if it is...IMHO

--- 帖子 #42 ---
One issue is what time frame chart are we using? For example if we use a 15min chart and draw the fib timelines 45 bars from a swing high/low, we would get very different results if we went to a 1HR chart..IMHO So we have to establish a timeframe to use consistently.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Looks like we are breaking through the 1.3044 level..which also coincides with the weekly S1 level .next stop is around 1.3068 level, then on to 1.3098 ...that is if there is enough steam

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I have placed a plot for recent swing high as shown on pic. Look what happened at the 22.5 vertical line!!! Look what happened at the 67.5 line!!! So who says we can't predict the future??? These time/price collisions are amazing...but buyer beware,,,it doesnt happen all the time, but one has to be AWARE THAT A POTENTIAL REVERSAL IS IMMINENT. IMHO

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This is getting more interesting... Are u making d indicator that will help plot it as well?? Very well done buddy...am loving this...

--- 帖子 #46 ---
That is the ultimate goal...right now I am just drawing the vertical lines using the Fibonacci Time Zones...I have been inputting the different levels using Gann theory...they are very different than the defaults...it is amazing even myself... Time &amp; price just nailed todays low almost to the pip, as well as yesterdays high. And these levels were drawn based on the high of FEB. 9th!! I have yet to plot the timelines based on any recent low,,I wanted to work out the formulas first...so far so good

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Uh-oh...just drew a series off a recent swing low ...this bar of 11:45am EST 15M chart shows a 45^ line...usually a reversal point...lets see what happens!!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I was taught that a reaction off these lines have a +/- of about 2 bars either way...so nothing is absolute.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
First and foremost, I would like to thank you for turning this calculator into a indicator. I am very grateful for this. This calculation has been a part of my system for years now, but with this indicator it makes things easier. I use Gann's calculation in all markets. I will post up some charts later.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
How far you are with your process of working out the formulas? would be great if you have the time to post a short statement . zackery

--- 帖子 #51 ---
so what we need to make a System is an indicator which: 1. plot vertical lines every X-bars based from an automated HIGH/LOW of a X-Timeframe (MTF) 2. possibility to put as many indis from this special one to the Trader- Charts Maybe our incredible programmer "brooky" could do this? Would be great. Greetings zackery

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Zackery Hi. I will have a look at it for you in the next day or so. Cheers Brooky.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Exactly what I have been doing manually. I have searched high and low (no pun intended) and I have not found anything on the web.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
so it's good to have "brooky" here

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi all. Updated indicator includes. 1) All the stuff it had before :-) 2) Option to show Bar cycles of your length from auto MTF start point or where you manually place the control bar. 3) Option to turn on a double Gann Grid that will auto calculate from the Cycle period that you enter. 4) All objects should ( if I got it right ) be available to each copy you put on chart as long as you change the alpha character for each copy on chart as before. Now that there are a larger amount of variables, it would be very helpful if those that really get Gann to assist in the correction of any default values. If they could mention them here, I can hardcode a viable starting set into the indicator. If something goes wrong with the code, just pop a note up on the thread and I will attend to it. Cheers Brooky.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
AWESOME

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Brooky you are a treasure

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I have been following this thread with interest from the start. I can see how useful it is not having to manually draw these levels on the chart. Brooky 29 you originally knocked up an indicator to show automatically the first circle lines from any point which as you say are the most used in Forex. Assuming that you haven't already done so is it also possible for you to incorporate more than one circle. For instance in Moneydeeps original excel file "360 price" there are a few circles. If this is possible for you to do can you code say 6 of these circles. You may well ask the reason for this request and the answer is that some of us use the Meta trader software for Stocks as well as for Forex. Thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Dear Moneydeep &amp; Dear Brooky And All I have tested the last ind on EURUSD pair at 60 TF and got an amazing chart prediction of where the euro will go. This pair hit 1.3485 as the High of that day. I made the grid "false" and replaced the time frame to be 60 instead of the default value. Attached is the chart, Brooky &amp; Moneydeep, can you comment, plz Cheers

--- 帖子 #61 ---
If traders cannot manually work the excel file given in the beginning of this thread, most likely you guys wont find consistency using this method. The first indicator Brooky made is perfect enough and yet traders wants it curve fitted because they don't understand how to use it. Gann did not give hard rules for traders to follow because that would be too easy but instead he left clues in all of his writings for us to decipher. This is why I'm so hesitant to put up charts because I don't think anyone on this thread read any of Gann's books at all. Applying GannSq9 without knowing its context and true formula is the biggest fallacy of all. I would suggest traders strap them self down because Gann's techniques takes years to master. Good Luck To Everybody's Grueling Journey.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Jer21 I respect your suggestion, but to know that as an arabic trader, I read most of Gann's books and illustrations, even tested the methodology of square of 5 in time and price effect on prices based on previous H/L swings. But any how , there is no limit for today prospectived tradeds and their urgent demand to simplify theses rules of Gann into simple charts. In the Arabic World of traders , we have an excellent and distinguished trader named "Hamadasalam". He put rules and facts about how to trade forex based on Gann's ideas. Always , humanbeing must seek moderm techniques to develop old ideas , to get benifet from them and how to apply these techniques into our side is the last dream for any trader. Hope to see more charts and more new ideas from members of this thread. Hence , we can go furhter. Plz accept my full respect to what you suggested but different ideas must not make us hate each others.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I just wanted to say THANKS,these gann lines has helped in my trading! Hope this thread keeps on going with such great info being shared, Sure enjoy reading all the comments here and learning.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi all, I am new to ForexFactory but have been told by a friend to look at this thread as I trade using Gann. I note that there have been no messages since Mar 2nd, I hope that there are still members interested who will be willing to assist in how to trade with the mq4's developed by Brooky29. If anyone is monitoring this thread I would be pleased to hear your views. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #65 ---
im too in the way learning and deepen the gann technique hope will learn together

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Rexfo, Do you trade using Gann or are you trying to learn? Allonso

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I dont know why this very important subject is paused. Where are moneydeep, brooky, .. all others. We need more interaction and more testing on the indicators to make it applicable to forecast next day trading opportunities if possible.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Naser_Mohamm, I agree with you entirely, such an important subject should still be actively under discussion. I was hoping that some of the previous guys with the expertise would return and help those of us who do not fully understand the operation of the indicators even if we do know a fair bit about Gann trading. I traded Gann on stocks for many years and now need some help in applying the principles to Forex. Anyone with knowledge of the lastest Moneydeep indicator and can tell me why the cycle lines jump from where I place them, will be welcomed. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Allonso and others Hi, I still monitor the thread and get pm's from guys who want to know things, so if I get a message that something needs clearing up I am happy to help. As you may have read earlier in the thread, I do not use this indicator in my own trading, however I do use some of the logic entwined with other indicators. I was actually hoping for some more Gann related charts from active Gann traders, but it seems as if Gann officienados are very secretive about such things, Much more than regular traders with regular systems. With regard to the cycle lines jumping, I can only assume that you are moving the bar and then watching the cycles jump back to where they were on the next tick. If that is the case then the option UseAutoTfHiLos needs to be turned OFF. That should keep the cycles in position. In the interests of adding to the discussion, I will prepare a chart with my chosen supply demand style of trading and post it up as a way of adding another flavour into the mix. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi all. As mentioned before, I did up a chart with my way of picking a valid point to use for setting a grid up. Since I use supply and demand logic in my own trading, it seemed natural to use a very significant recent point of supply as a starter point for the bar, and for later levels, one would just follow the lower lows down by dragging the bottom of the control bar down. What I found interesting was the pinpoint timing of the lowest low of the NFP effect on a time cycle that was in place from the moment the first touch was made on the big supply bar up top many hours before. The chart has my notes on it, but it may be interesting when picking points in the past, to think of them as how important a rejection they were in terms of supply and demand. One can also see why today has been a ping pong match between the close supply and demand levels before supply was finally exhausted. I am still long from this morning so I am hoping they are in search of some more supply up north. I would love to hear from a Gann trader as to what their call would be in a situation like this. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Brooky, Welcome back! So nice that someone with indicator knowledge is back on this thread. I mainly use the 15 min chart, so if do as you say and change the daily timing from 1440 to 15, am I then on track to make things work. Can you please explain where and how you get the "supply and demand logic bars" is this another of your great indicators? On another note, I attempted to program a line indicator. It works after a fashion but doesent acheive all I wanted. Is there any chance you would consider having a look at it, if I sent you the mq4 and detail of what I am trying to do. Thanks for your return maybe now other interested parties may also show up with their experiences and we can get the discussion motoring again. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Allonso Regarding changing the timing to M15: 1) If the UseAutoTfHiLos option is set to true , the indi will find the High and Low of that timeframe to set itself to. If you are using M15, I would suggest to leave it at any period bigger than that. 2) If the UseAutoTfHiLos option is set to false , you can achieve what I have on the chart because you can pull the control bar onto any bar of your choice and then elongate it to a relevant point as I have done. Re: "supply and demand logic bars". I do have a supply demand indi which has not been released as yet ( it will be commercial ), but this is just a general term used. If you want to know more about Supply and Demand, there are some good threads here or you can go to my website educational area where you can sign up for a whole stack of stuff that will explain it and much more in detail from the partnership we have with the online trading academy. Re: Line indi. If you do not want to share here you can always pm me and I can have a look for you. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Brooky29, Thanks for the information on "Supply &amp; Demand" will have a look at the appropriate threads and maybe your own website as well. I am quite OK with sharing the line mq4 but would advise anyone interested to not copy or use it in it's present state as they will not be very happy with some of the problems. As it is not related to Gann I suppose if I am allowed it would be sensible to start a thread to explain the theory and how I use it. Anyway the idea was to make an indicator that would place as many horizontal lines as required, from a selected starting point at a pre-selected spacing. It does everything I wanted except for the following: 1. Delete all lines from the window, from the selection of any line. I thought that ObjectsDeleteAll(); would achieve it, but it doesent. 2. I have not found a way to replace the pre-selected spacing from a value of the type 0.005 to a simpler type 50 pips. Other than that it does mainly what I intended, I can plot lines Up from a value or Down by adding a - sign in front of the selected spacing values. Hope it will not be too much trouble to ammend the code, it will also help me in my understaning of mq4 coding. As this was my first attempt I am quite pleased it at least does some of what I intended. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Allonso. Good first effort. Problems as described appear to be fixed. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Brooky29, Wow that was a fast response. Only one problem and that is: 1. Delete all lines from the window, from the selection of any line. I thought that ObjectsDeleteAll(); would achieve it, but it doesent. ........ I have loaded and tried this and the only thing I can do is dbl click on a line and that line deletes, but all the rest are still showing in the window. Is it something I am doing wrong? Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Allonso Hi Maybe I am not of full understanding here but it appears as if you want the effect of unloading the indicator by having all the lines disappear yet still have an indicator resident in memory not showing anything? The deletion of the lines does not unload the indicator. Or perhaps you want the indicator on the chart, empty but ready to do something?? Maybe a prompt on chart that it is running is needed then. Let me know. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi all Just a note to those who are contributing or lurking that i am in the process of finishing the next version that has 6 circles to choose from, an auto cycle identifier and a few other goodies, so don't throw Moneydeeps ( Hi mate where are you? ) thread in the bin just yet :-) I have done this to make it easier for those that really don't get Gann at all to get some auto use out of the indicator. For those that really do get Gann, I realize that the surface is only being scratched here but I hope that you are getting some use out of the indi's. cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I just wanted to say thanks for keep updating the indicators, keep up the GREAT work.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Brooky29, Sorry to cause you so much bother. What I hoped to be able to do was not delete the indicator from charts/indicators list, but just as you can double click on any line and delete it, I thought that there might be a way to delete all lines from the screen with one click. I hope I have explained it well enough for you to understand what I hope to acheive. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi, There were quite a number that showed interest in Gann trading following Moneydeeps posting of his excel calculator on this thread. Where are you now and why won't you post of your experiences with the Brooky29 indicator. To see the graphics of trades made would not only help beginners but futher the discussion of Gann and his methods. Don't be shy, take part in this interesting method. Allonso

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I'm sorry I haven't been much active in the thread. I'ts because I was busy with personal matters. Also I am a novice/intermediate trader at best and was hoping that by starting this thread others would post their experiences using gann lines. Brooky has done a great job with the indicator and I use it for my daily analysis. (I don't use the latest one though). I am going through a time where I realised that I needed some inner peace and quiet to develop a system of trading that I feel comfortable with. This has kept me busy. I've been doing research on timing and hope to share it here someday. I can post charts sometimes if that helps but you have to realise my main intention with this thread was to put this out so people could use it with their system(whatever way they trade) I said clearly on the first thread this is not a system. PHEW saying that I will pop in now and then if anyone has questions but the indicator kinda answeres everything

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Moneydeep, Glad you dropped in and yes it would be great if you can post charts sometimes, it all helps the rest of us who are trying to find out how the Brooky29 indicator is helping with trading. I have read lots about Gann and his timing methods and the more I read the more confusing it becomes, there are so many times given, Calendar days, Trading Days, Weekly timing and so on. Even then I am not sure how it would apply to FX. However I have attached a chart of Brooky29's indicator with a Ganns 11 trading days setting. As can be seen the are quite a number of minor peaks that are either on a line or within two bars of it. Problem is that the lower the TD setting then inevitably we are going to get more hits and close approximations, and do we really want to know minor turns or are we after Intermediate and Major turning points. I am hoping that Brooky29's new indicator when ready may help to resolve some of these puzzles. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Allonso Hi. Just to keep you and others in the loop, one of the other traders from here has been kindly assisting in getting the next indi to a holistic state where there is something in it for everyone. It should not be too long before it can be posted up. Snapshot below of where it is up to using an auto 11 day set back. Many auto features for the uninitiated and the squaring calcs shown and the square shaded for reference. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #84 ---
definitely consider myself a lurker to this thread, but I do keep checking in to see the updates haven't figured out a way to incorporate it into my trading yet, but from observing price behavior around the Gann lines it seems that one can utilize them much in the same manner as pivot points. Anyone have thoughts on this method of use?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
When I originally started thats exactly what I was doing. Observing price action around those lines and trading.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
That's what I got from reading his square of nine theory. 4 of the numbers act as support. 4 of them act as resistance. And the middle one is the pivot point.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Here is a pretty useful script that I use to delete objects from a chart with a single click. Put it in your experts/scripts folder, then just double click on it and all objects will be removed from your chart.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Brooky, Looking at the graphic of your new indi, I thought I had been transported to the flight deck of the Starship Enterprise. Those elliptical curves look very much like planetary orbits, looking forward to loading it and testing just what it can do. By the way does it come with an operating manual. Allonso

Hi Aldente Thanks for the script, I will give it a try. I live in hope that when Brooky has finished all the hard work on this new indi he may find a coding solution, so that my line indi can operate completely on its's own. Many thanks though Allonso

Thank you for the topic, it made me register to the forum. As you've pointed out already, the problem with Gann is the time factor. Gann experts are super-secretive about timing. The rest is pretty basic maths, we can draw lots of s/r lines in hindsight, but will be lost at trading them in real time. There is a distinction in the scale, which is not clear enough in the original Excel sheet and it's even more blurred in the indicator's settings. We can divide a circle in halves (then quarters, eighths etc.) or thirds (then sixths, twelfths etc.): i.e. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 (50%, 25%, 12,5% or 180°, 90°, 25°); and 2/3, 1/3 (66,6%, 33,3% or 240°, 120°) etc. This normally yields more consistent results on an instrument. However, alternating the "major" levels (50% or 25% with 66,6% or 33,3%) might yield consistent results as well. All depends on the definitions, though. For instance, 50% might mean half (or twice) the current price – or halfway between a chosen price swing. I have yet to test the sheet and the indicator based on an instrument's all time high or all time low, looking for confluence. Apart from these, I couldn't find anything else consistent enough when it comes to Gann expertise. And as I mentioned, this is all pretty useless without knowing how to calculate the time factor.

Hi All, This thread had become very interesting and attractive. But it seems that if Moneydeep can give us some examples on how he trades using Brooky's indis. If possible, this will be a kindness effort from all here to understand how to use this system in real trading. Cheers,,,

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi to everyone else, Dont be lurkers join in the discussion and lets get some trades posted using the one Gann method that works, with graphic illustrations would be the ideal thing. You only have to load the Brooky29 indi on page 4 No 56 and play around with it until you get the feel and then try some demo trades and then post a graphic of it and tell us of your experience. The more Brain Power we can get on this thread the better we are all going to be as traders. Join us don't lurk. Allonso

All, I don't have more than superficial knowledge of gann, but have been able to use this indicator along with others to make some real nice trades. Don't have the source code but it can easily be decompiled, this is much more accurate than any moving average scheme i've seen. Maybe it can also help some of you, I can share my experiences on it for those interested. You can see my thread in trading systems. (blue line) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Moneydeep, You have put forth a fresh approach for applying Gann principles and trading system which will prove useful to members. This can be compared to Pivot Point Generation and then reconfirming with other trading tools. Best wishes. Sharad Kapadia

In a nutshell, when the current price candle on 1 hr chart closes above the gann line, i go long. Opposite for short, if candle on 1 hr closes below the gann line, maybe a good time to short. I also apply lots of filtering that has nothing to do with gann. Please see my thread here on how I trade: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=345808

All, I've hit a treasure trove of very old gann documentation. From what I'm reading due to the age of the material I don't think these are still under copyright. If anyone has information to the contrary, let me know and I will remove it. Behold! I have lots more too..

--- 帖子 #98 ---
to those using this indicator, what settings are you finding most useful? curious if people are using the Auto TF hi lo option, if so are you using the default 3 bars back and which higher TF do you use? personally i've been fiddling with different settings to see if I can get a usable Gann grid, explored using just 1 bar back auto TF to 10800 for H1 charts (so using the hi and lo from the last weekly bar) and it seems that prices are respecting the grid angles and the cycle of 34 seems to be significant I'm trying to explore the usage of this indicator without the AutoTFhilo option as well. Is the correct use to identify recent swing hi and swing low points and stretch the control bar ends to meet these points?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just got it loaded. I left it at 1440, since for some reason when i set it to 60 it scaled oddly and got moved too far right? not sure what happened. Anyway, the default lookback on my gann hi-lo activator is 10, so I set the Brooky one to the same see above. I really like this, since the hi-lo activator can flicker sometimes (which is when I usually rely on higher TF's during "noise") this helps me understand the noise and see the support Fantastic Brooky!!!!!!!!

Hi All, I thought I would just submit this graphic of the Dow 1900-1998 as evidence that a mathmatical relationship does exist in the market and that Ganns sq9 method of projecting turning points does work. All Gann lines have been calculated from lows in 1903 for the high of 1929, and 1932 for the highs in 1973, 1987, 1997 and 1998. Solid blues are the low dates, dashed blue are the high dates and red is the lows levels Although not show as part of this graphic, I have also used the 1932 low to calculate the highs of 2000 and 2007, both levels were &lt; 0.3% of the move up from the low that took 68 and 75 years. When you consider that over the total period of nearly 100 years, the constituents of the Dow must have changed on numerous occasions. How can it be argued that there is no mathmatical order in the markets and that Gann is just another fad. All those that unsure or downright sceptical should do the maths for themselves, prove to me that this is bunkum and I will give up trading and just play marbles. Allonso

Hi All, I have noted that graphics are loaded with a dark background. I don't know how you will all feel if I ask that background are made lighter so that they can be seen clearly.

Hi Neuron, From the price pattern I think you are trading the 15min-EUR/USD, which at the moment is falling towards the blue 1.31730 line. It will be interesting to see if it recovers and eventually makes the red gann line above. Hope you are making some pips. Allonso

Hi Allonso, I still haven't traded significant sizes using this system as I'm currently still in observation/testing stages The chart is H1 It's intriguing to see the price action, we can see it advancing and retracing according to the Gann grid

--- 帖子 #111 ---
what i observe so far is dat the grid tend to send price the opposite direction. for example, in d chart posted, as at last night, direction was up as at d time of reaching the grid, and d rest is history. will history repeats itself tomorrow? time will tell. its just my observation so far....keep it simple

Hi All, Does anyone know of an indicator that counts the number of bars between two points. Allonso

EU actually tank as expected from the grid. However, I noticed that the grid lines changed on my chart as at the time I chked this morning... but as i have already marked it and noted the time.....i was able to take advantage. cheers

--- 帖子 #114 ---
It's already in MT4. Use the crosshair tool (Ctrl+F), then click on one point on the chart and draw a line, it will display x/y/z, where x = number of bars between the two points, y = number of pips between the two points, z = the price under the pointer. Back to the thread, I again want to press the importance of the time factor (see #90 ). In most charting programs, including MT4, the so-called "Gann tools" are complete BS. They are graphical tools like the trendline tool, while Gann lines and angles are based on pure mathematical calculations. Change the timeframe on a chart and you'll see the "Gann" lines skip. Not to mention the data, different brokers open at different times and give you different data-feed, which can completely mess up your calculations. Any consistency you see just by drawing with your "Gann tools" is wishful thinking. Sorry if that sounds rude. Let's just base our ideas on the original Excel sheet.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Belmont, Thanks for the info can now check bars as I want. Do you know if it possible to change the colour and print size so that I can see it better. Would be an improvement as far as I am concerned. Yes you are right we can calculate the Gann S/R levels, but without knowing the expected striking time, trading is possible but much more difficult. To my mind if there is a mathematical relationship to give possible S/R lines then there must also be one for time. (The Gann Secret). Many claim to know and will divulge their version of it for a FAT FEE. Regards Allonso

That is one problem with mt4. I draw a lot. and over the weekend I have to redo the charts because of the time gap sunday candle. Also because of the scaling factor. Sometimes even durning the week I see my lines shift :S Here's a screenie of what my terminal looks like. The vertical lines are timing signals. Thats when I enter trades. Otherwise I stay out. There was one I entered between timings. Overall I caught 5 of 7 of those trades. One was a looser if you can see Other 2 trades I was too tired to get up at 1:30am in the morning to put the trade. I'm not ready to share this cause its a little advanced and its still a work in progress and brookys indicator makes life simple but i just wanted to show that gann does make money. http://i.imgur.com/wZXWO.png

Hi Moneydeep, Interesting but busy graphic, will be interested to know when you are ready to tell us just how you are setting your time lines as they do not seem to me to be equally spaced or based on fibonnaci numbers. Quite a number fall on Highs or Lows, but some are missed. I still feel that as Gann calculated his S/R levels using Sq9 then somehow the time must also be a mathematical calculation. With regard to the time gap Sunday candle, you should be able to avoid this if you use FXPro for you analysis, as there is no Sunday data. Look forward to any other posts you may like to share with us. Regards Allonso

Hi all. While still sorting out an update to existing indi's I found as mentioned before some miscalculations in MoneyDeeps original spreadsheet. The attached spreadsheet still contains the original so that others can check the maths, but it is hidden and the input area now draws on computer calculations and not manual ones as in the original. If anyone is still using the spreadsheet, this one should be error free. I will post up some more as I get time. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Brooky, Do the mistakes you found affect the results of your current indi on post 83? Looking forward to the revised indi you are working on it looks good. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi. No they do not. The auto calcs of the indi and an observation by another trader showed up the discrepancies in the spreadsheet. For those that are using the new spreadsheet, you will notice that a few of the data boxes are grey and not green. These are the cells that are incorrect in the original spreadsheet. I am rethinking the approach taken initially with the vertical cycle lines as the data plots of another approach are leading towards a better timing outcome. It will take a little while to finish though. For interests sake the data plot pic is below as is an initial time plot on a daily chart. For those that know Gann, they will not be surprised by the plots. Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Brooky, Like the look of the new vertical cycle lines, if they tie up with the Gann S/R lines trading takes on a new dimension. Little bit of common sense on the money management front and we may yet make a decent number of pips. Allonso

Hi All. The indicator attached can be simply used to calculate bars spanned, or in context of this thread, it will calculate the Degrees of the bars spanned and the pips covered by the range if you want. If you load it onto a chart, you can just park it out of the way in a corner until you need it again. When you load it, just double click on the rectangle and use the grab handles to push n pull it around. Some may want to position it in a Gannish spot as calculated by the angles and then manually draw some lines, fans cycles etc over/relevant to it, so it could be a handy addition to the ol tool chest for a variety of reasons. Colors placements sizes etc are all optioned. Cheers Brooky

Hi Brooky, You have said that you do not trade using Gann, but you certainly are a friend of all those that do. Another indicator that will have its uses and with other things, timing etc; that you are investigating as per your quote "I am rethinking the approach taken initially with the vertical cycle lines as the data plots of another approach are leading towards a better timing outcome". All of which will help Gann traders towards better analysis and hopefully some measure of success. A big thank you from me. Regards Allonso

Hi, Does anyone trade the 15 min TF using Gann. Moneydeeps 360.xls program gives a lowest level of 45deg and this often means that the price trades within two S/R lies for quite a time, resulting a lost opportunity for short term traders when price moves 50pips in an 8hr period. I would be interested in opinions of those that do or have traded the 15min TF using Ganns method. Allonso

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi, It seems to me that except for Brooky and myself, everyone else is either making a killing with the Brooky indicator and don't want to share their results. Have becomed disallusioned with Gann as they don't understand what the heck it's all a about or have passed over to the great void. Its a shame as with lots of discussion about this very interesting style of trading, we could have had a very viable thread. I shall miss you all. Allonso.

Hi Sparks60, I would be delighted to still take part in this thread, but when no one else can be bothered to join in and discuss Gann trading and ask questions which we can all brainstorm or even post their demo trades and research. It does then become very weird with the takers of this world hoping that someone else can provide them with the answer without them lifting a finger to contribute. I have notice many times that when I have logged on to the thread there is maybe one or two members viewing and three or four more who have not logged in or not yet joined ForexFactory. If some of these invisible viewers would come and join in we may eventually get somewhere. Now I have mentioned before that it seemed to me that if S/R levels can be mathematically calculated then there should also be a relationship with TIME. I read the other day on the web of a expectancy that the AUD/USD, which made a high on the 27/07/2011 should make another high on the 26/01/2012, these are calendar dates . As you can see from the Graphic it did'nt but it did make a high 67 days later on the 27/10/2011. Their date was in fact 65 days following the previous high, Whereas the high following their expected date on the 29/02/2012 was 90 days from the previous high. There are other relationships that fall on or near Gann numbers, in fact the largest error I have found is &lt;1.5%. Starting with the Gann number 11 check multiples of this number up to 800. I checked From Feb 2001 to Feb 2003 -752 Daily Bars, error 0.366%. I suggest that you check them for yourself. I have also attached a sreenshot of the EUR/USD - 15min Tf which I like to trade and found that these relationships work there as well. I dont claim that they are accurate to the bar, but provide a framework to work within. Test it and discuss your findings. Allonso

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hello, I think the problem is that this thread is more like ideas flying round without any consistency. That just scares most people away. As to the original Excel sheet + indicator based on it, I didn't have time to test it thoroughly, so I can't say if these calculations are consistent enough for me or not. Then again, it would be a totally different matter to actually trade them.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I tried the indicators which Brooky29 did and found that at times the levels are respected. However I do not understand it enough to use it. I hope that moneydeep who started this thread could guide us enough to understand.

Just to let you know that I have been in contact with Brooky recently regarding a query I had. He told me that he has been busy recently but that will be back on the Gann PVS Thread soon, as and when time allows. I think in the meantime on this thread we owe him an extra shout because to date he has done a great job on this Gann PVS indicator. Nice one Brooky! http://www.Brooky-Indicators.com

Welcome to the thread. Suggest that if you haven't already done so work your way through the thread to get a flavor of where we are up to. Reading between the lines the majority of the contributors on this thread would like it to reach its full potential. Some of the contributors (they know they are) have done really well on the thread. it makes you want to shake their hand. Presently though we have come to a temporary quiet period! LOL I guess its because of time issues and also we need to learn how to get positive results from WD Gann techniques and feel confident about it in our trading experiences. You have said that you know a little bit about Gann and his trading systems. "We value your contribution Ilovepippin"

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thank you Zingers. Problem with Gann is that he did sooo much that how are you going to trade all that? Well, I can boil it down to one thing: Gann was a trend follower. Shocking right? He had 1000 techniques to determine a change in trend, but the important thing is that he traded the trend! Which is what we want to do, trading. We are not in the business of forecasting. So how did he do that? Well, he used tools such as the square of 9 and his Gann lines. It is not so important to know how he got them, all we need to know is if it works or not. I'll shoot is straight up here, Gann used astro, but all this astro stuff boils down to mathematics which is easily drawn on a chart. Just like fibonacci numbers really. He said that: " In the end there are only mathematical points of force" Basically the trend is determined by the Gann lines, if price is following the line it is following the trend. On a break the trend changes. The Gann grid has very specific settings, but is not necessary for trading. What you want to do is determine the trend, if trend is up, buy the dips, if trend is down, sell the highs. Simple right? For that we need the lines and the square of 9. The SQ9 is a function of price, so that is easy. No hocus pocus required. To determine a change in trend we can use a simple oscillator. To calculate a future price point we can use the pythagoras theoreum. Then we need a dashboard to tell us how strong the trend is. Most important we need a solid money management system. I have a system in place that I trade manually. We can improve on that. I have a few indicators that we can combine into one to make it easy. That is really all it is. Gann was a very good swing trader and his method was simple. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi, Ilovepippin So have you then discovered the technique that Gann used in the Trading Pits that up until recently have been generally shrouded in mystery? Also is this a technique that we can get positive results from and confidently use in our own trading?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Trust me, there is no mortal soul on this planet that knows all the secrets of Gann. When Gann passed away he left truckloads of writings behind. Most of it purchased by the people from wdgann.com. But lots of his writings were lost. On top of that we can only know what he wrote down for us to decipher, which may not be everything he knew. However, it is not necessary to know everything to be a trader. Gann left us some plain and simple instructions and rules for successfull trading, not shrouded in any mysteries at all. Now, part 2 of your question. It is up to the trader to be successful. You need to be able to follow rules. No system is without losses. Gann lost trades as well. Traders are not all alike. One can have a system that works 100% for one person, and totally not work for another person.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yes I did read an article once that not only did he make the usual trading losses but also lost money in brokerage firms that went bankrupt. What we are hoping for though on this thread are Gann Charts and simple instructions from "active Gann traders", using the Gann PVS (Price vibration System) but what we have generally found so far are that Gann traders appear to be secretive about such things. So it is refreshing to hear that you know a little bit about Gann and his trading systems and are willing to share with us.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi All, I must say that to see additional interested parties on this thread gladdens my heart. At times trying to get others to join in and take part in Moneydeeps interesting thread was like watching paint dry, very, very boring. I am hoping that this will be permanent and that we can now get discussion on the aspects of Gann applicable to this thread going. We already have with Moneydeeps .xls306 excel program and Brookys indicator, a means of determining S/R lines. I have shown in my post 137 on April 5th that relationships exist in timing. I myself, because I trade on the 15m TF have shown that the relationship exists at all levels and Brooky is also looking to produce an indicator which will help us all, this is ofcourse subject to time constaints as he is a very busy trader. Disappointingly nobody has yet posted to confirm my research or to refute it. Gann as has been said was a very prolific writer and I am not sure that all that is being posted by the vested interest is correct. Although I won't go into the detail here, there is published scientific papers that say that the planets have little influence on the markets, if you want to know more get searching. As far as I am concerned Moneydeeps S/R lines and if we can tie it down Timing are the main concepts we are looking at. Can I persuade those that are interested to do research on these aspects and help advance these concepts to achieve a workable solution. Allonso

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Allonso, You are on the right track. The "secret" in tehse cycles is to find the right anchoring point. Because, how do you know which one is next? You don't. What we can do is program a bunch of know cycles and see which one works. Maybe an indicator that has some preprogrammed cycles which you can plot by selecting them (true/false). You say you want 15 m charts. That is indeed a very good TF for short term turns. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Okay, the "Law of Vibration" what is that? Do we need to know what it is? We really don't, all we need to know is how we can apply it to trading. Ganns fundamental setup were his Gann lines. The basis of all his trading were these Gann lines which he used for trend determination. Now, there are 8 of them as there are 8 octaves in music. Thats a bit of the veiled language for you. The ones that are important are the 2x1, 1x1 and 1x2 for Forex. He drew these charts based upon a cycle. The cycle he used was 1 day for 1 cent. So, on a 4 digit platform that is 24h for 100 pips (for 5 digits multiply by 10). This is the 1x1 line. The 2x1 line is 100 pips for 12 hours and 1x2 is 100 pips for 36 hours. Draw these from a low ang high point. Above these lines, trend is up, below these line trend is down. Simple as that. It looks like this:

So Ilovepippin this sounds like the "dashboard" you mentioned above. OK thanks we understand that. Now if you would kindly show us the "simple oscillator", "pythagoras theoreum", and the "indicators" that you previously mentioned. Zingers

--- 帖子 #151 ---
One thing I haven't figured out is the optimum setting for Brooky's indicator A part of me feels like the proper utilization would be to manually determine the high and low points (by dragging the red control bar). My reasoning is that significant hi and low points may not fall on the same day/bar? Or if someone is using the Auto hi-lo option, have you changed settings from the default? What do you guys think?

One step at the time Zinger... This is a process.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
The simple indi is the MACD or any oscillator that can detect divergence. If we can signal a divergence coming in the indi together with the Gann lines, we are well on our way. This is a good indicator of a direction change. Gann said to confirm the change of trend, this is one way. Next I'll post about cycles.

Gann angles - a powerful tool for generating profits ... The method by which the analysis is based forex trading by using Gann angles, is one of the most popular, but at the same time challenging. But, despite this, the theory is often used to assess and predict the currency market. All indicators and methodological developments in the forex has its own characteristics. Forex Analysis according to the theory is no exception. Very often one can observe that the Gann angles mistaken for a trend line. And they are really very similar. Market fluctuations are clothed in a certain range. The top of the angles is the starting point of the incident trends, fluctuations in the base - the starting point of a growing trend. But in fact this is not the case and there are some differences. Gann Line represents a dynamic line that has the ability to move both on the horizontal axis and the vertical. This is not so obvious difference, but it's still there. Can be analyzed with the help of Forex charts, with the result that we can identify certain angle fluctuations of the stock, according to which we can define the limits of the speakers. But it is necessary to take into account that, if used to analyze too many corners, it can be confusing. On the whole theory of the Gann based on the following postulates, which are taken as a basis: A. Price, time and range of fluctuations in foreign exchange market Two. There is a certain geometric construction market, which is analyzed, it is possible to come to the conclusion that its subsequent motion Three. Markets are characterized by cyclical Gann believed that the market is a reflection of human nature, which is constant, so over time by analyzing past events, we can build based on their vision of the future. Using Gann angles, in practice, According to Gann's theories, the analysis of forex should be built on three models to help predict the behavior of the market in the future: A. The study. It is taken as the basis of historically recurring dates Two. Price range. It uses support and resistance lines, as well as the pivot point. Three. The plan of analysis. The application of this theory into practice requires a great deal of experience and knowledge, so here we noted the most important points to remember if you are using in their practice, such analysis forex. Decide which model you use in your trading. The most common models are the models 1, 2, and 1x2. Between these angles there is a definite difference in the slope of the lines. Overall, Gunn singled out a lot more angles. They are: - 1 x 1 - 45 degrees - 1 x 2 - 63.75 degrees - 1 x 3 - 71.25 degrees - 1 x 4 - 75 degrees - 1 x 8 - 82.5 degrees - 2 x 1 - 26.25 degrees - 4 x 1 - 15 degrees - 8 x 1 - 1.5 degrees In this case, the first variable is a unit of time, the second - a unit price. That is, according to the formula determined by the ratio between price and time interval. The value of the line 45 degrees According to Gann, this line is a line of long-term trend, it does not matter - ascending or descending. It is believed that if the price is above the ascending line, then the market is bullish mood. If the price is below the descending line, it is considered that the market holds a bearish mood. The intersection of the price of any of the lines will be talking about what is planned to change the trend. It should be noted that this line is a balance between price range and time. Quite often one can observe that when the price approaches the line, then the market is the balance of time and money. In addition, the chart can cause the channel, which should be placed parallel to the main trend line at a considerable distance from the extremes of the market. Under this line of the next line, which is based on the ratio of 2x1 shows that the two units of time has changed the price of one unit. In this case, line 4x1 will be even more shallow than line 2x 1. Gann Theory has some similarities with the fan-like lines, which are based on Fibonacci ratios. As the market moves up or down to adjust the angles to the existing tendency to form support and resistance levels. One notable method that is based on the theory of Gann - cardinal square, or "fundamental square method." This method is based on the concept of market analysis by reference to a certain size from as low as the price of the stock. This index can be calculated by conducting analysis of forex extended period of time, from several years to several decades. On the basis of such an operation is possible with a high probability to predict the location of support and resistance lines, which may appear in the future. The initial price is placed at the center of the square, then the correction as it is amended in a clockwise direction. Gradually, the horizontal and vertical lines form a cross in the center of the square. And the data that form the intersection is used as the likely support and resistance levels.

Hi lotos7, Who or what is Corners Hannah? What has it to do with Gann? Where can we see the original transcipt? Sorry to say that I do not understand most of what you have written, more detail needed and some example of what is meant. Allonso

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Ilovepippin, Can't say that I have ever been a fan of Gann fans. LOL. As they always seem to move from the original setting if you zoom or change TF's, unless you use a specially written program, they are around but costly. You seem to be taking a different road to timing, but it will be interesting to follow your process. Allonso

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Loto7 is correct. It is not a simple trendline. I worked out the angles on mt4 because we cannot square the chart. The angles are as I said, 24 h for 100 pips for 1x1. Works like a charm.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Interesting info. Do you find similar coincidence in other pairs?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
========================================================== 1x1 ...

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Guys, it is very important to understand that the Gann line and Gann fan included in the MT4 software are absolutely useless. Gannlines either need to be handdrawn or included in the (brooky) indicator.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
First we need to go back to middle school to understand how we measure time. We measure time as follows: The earth rotates one cycle around its axle and we call that a day. The earth orbits around the sun in 365.25 days and we call that a year. The moon orbits around the earth in 29.5 days and we call that a month. 12 months in a year, 365 days in a year. One orbit is 360 degrees. the earth travels 360/365= 0.98 degrees a day. For ease of use we will say 1 degree a day. Now the cycles: 360 degree a day for one rotation = 360 degree per 24 hours that equals 4 minutes for one degree. This is the smallest cycle and very useful for intraday trading. If you work it out further to a workable cycle on a 15m intraday chart the 5 hour cycle works very well. 5*60=300 minutes = 75 degrees of rotation 75*4.8=360. On the GBPUSD it nailed the top exactly and with Gann lines and MACD it looks like this. Nothing mysterious here. Just how everyone on earth is keeping time.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
If you put the Gann Lines above or below the current action and look for places that they intersect you get areas of possible change. On this chart I put the following angles. 1x2 2x3 1x1 3x2 2x1 you can see that direction changed nicely around each of the first 3 intersections. With that being said one of the problems with this type of analysis is that you can end up with so many lines on your charts you don't know what to do. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #166 ---
use horizontal and vertical lines to square off the ratio ilovepippin is talking about, connect using a trendline and that'll maintain the proper angle even if your chart setting isnt set to "one to one" (which doesn't work fit on screen for &gt;M15) the mt4 gann tools really are useless imo

--- 帖子 #167 ---

Nice work on the indicator Brooky Your template is very handy as well. ? can that be coded with a value tag say x bars back from current bar with the ratio on each line so it could be a visiable attribute attributed to each line for the timeframe its related to???

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Time lines??? Have you ever used or seen gann trader? there is a function within it that you set at a swing hi (or where ever) and starts a count autmatically with several different time formulas eg. fibonacci Gann Lucas etc all written into its library of numbers and when a number pops up it indicates (or perhaps and alert) would trigger a time point and a legend would let you know what type of time series was triggered. Myabe for time ratio's as well as bar counts. Maybe even take it a bit further and just have it plot a new sequence at the beginning of each swing running off a zigzag deviation, all adjustable, maybe too complex for MT4 or would probably slow CPU down as it followed each swing counting each bar and scanning the library for its time alert? There are tons of cycles, automating them all into a single library would be wonderfull dont you think. Running off any timeframe chart simply by having a starting point. Food for the coding wizards of the world. That i am not Well it actually does price and time together at each point but price is really irrelevant and time is the most important for Time tell ppl when to act regardless of price they will act...

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi OW, Most of the above sounds doable, in fact this indicator already does some of what you want. The cycle values just need to be added into arrays and then a comparison function checks the count on each new bar - see the text in the bottom left of the chart. Have you logged into Skype lately.... Regards

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I have followed the steps, but i dont know what is it that i am suppose to get. Where do you install the arrow from? is it by manually inserting the arrow? the grid lines did not appear.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi ILP, I can understand the scaling on an intraday graph of M15, M60 etc, but it seems a bit pushed on a daily graph? edit: i guess my Q is for example on a weekly, would you use 1week for 500pips for 1x1 etc?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi One day, The indicator looks interesting, did you finish the improved version? If so can you post it as it will be better than adapting the Fib Time tool as I have done at present. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Allonso, I added a few number sets to my own version, but other than that, I didn't go any further with this particular indi'. If you want any particular number sets included I can add them in if you don't want to amend the code yourself - if so, please list the numbers that you want in a comma separated list. I can just copy them into the arrays then. Regards

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Interesting indeed. Takes a bit of practice to figure out . Thanks.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hey Bro, yes it sure does i use it daily since its construction, Thanks for that!!!!! No havent lately, not even sure why. I ussually just let it run for the week. Next time you look it will be green . Hope all is well

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes, to keep a 1x1 ratio, multiply the pips by as much as you multiply the hours. Some people wanted a 15m chart so thats why I only had 1 cent for 1 day.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi One day, Downloaded the files, compiled them all OK, tried loading as instructed but get no lines showing, although some text is given on RH side of chart. Any idea what I may be doing wrong. Regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #181 ---
My suggestion is to do this based upon the Gann timefactor which is earth rotation. You can add it to the existing arrays, but you have to be carefull not to get cluttered with lines. As I said, the 4 minute cycle is the smallest cycle. Use cycles with 4 minute intervals and use earth rotation degrees. 45 degrees earth rotation is 3 hours = 180 minutes. 90 degrees earth rotation is 6 hours = 360 minutes. 120 degrees -- "" --- is 8 hours = 480 minutes. etc. 1 day = 24 hours = 1440 minutes. (144 important number) Then add days to it as well. 45 days, 90 days, 144 days etc.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I see your indi can measure price angle. That is interesting because price angles is what it is all about. If you can find the angle of current price action and can find a similar angle in the past, you can make a good prediction of where price is going.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
This morning it worked like a charm again. Divergence in the MACD, price stays above 1x1 Gannline. This time I added the Gann sq9 levels. These are a function of price. For 90 degrees price take the sqrt of the low = SQRT 1.2988= 113.965 Add 0.5 = 113.965 + 0.5 = 114.465 And multiply that by itself = 114.465 * 114.465 = 13102 = 1.3102 For 45 degrees add 0.25 For 180 degrees add 1 For 360 degrees add 2 etc.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Allonso, Difficult to say without a bit more info' from you...I have made a quick vid' to show you how I apply the indicator and script so that you can see if we are doing anything differently. Have a look and let me know if you resolve the issue. If not, please post a screen shot. Cheers

Thanks for the suggestion ILP, I'll have a think about that and see what I can put together....

Hi One day, Followed your video and it is now working, I did'nt realise that it only worked on the daily TF, I was trying to load it on the 15min TF which is what I like to trade. Can it be adapted to work on any TF as even the installed number set looks good on the Daily TF. Thanks and regards Allonso

--- 帖子 #187 ---
It is designed to work on any timeframe, but if you start on the daily and then drop down to the 15min, you may not see anything unless you scroll to the left. If you want to use it on the 15min, I would have a second chart open and load the script and indicator onto that chart. That should work fine - you just need to remember that the array is only set up to plot a certain number of vertical lines. After that number has been reached you will just have a message in the bottom right corner informing you that the count has been completed. Hope that helps....

OK, cheers ILP

Last attempt to give away this system. So far this move amounted to 175 pips. Its simple and profitable. However, I guess nobody wants a profitable system even if it is right in front of their nose.

Its a tough learning curve for many ILP trading the unknown or a putting a faith into a random line on a chart is hard for many to fathom, once they connect the dots though the curve straightens quickly and blind faith takes over

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I'd love to hear more about this. I am deeply impressed by your work. On the GBPUSD chart it looks like trades would have been taken off of the 2x1 line instead of the 1x1. How do we know which line to target?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Interesting posts ILP, I have coded up a number of related indi's, such as sq9 levels and Gann fans that allow inputting pips per bar to set up rather than the default MT4 method. Never really figured out how to incorporate anything into a system though...so I look forward to reading more of your posts. I'll dust down the indi's and post them up when I am happy with them. Cheers

Hello ILP, can you tell why you use the start point in center not left or rigth (in the pic i attach) TQ

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I want to understand this better. I assume that you are talking about picking a particular Gann angle that is using the 1Day x 1Cent. Or perhaps you are referring to a modified (fitted) price angle. Either way, I'd like to see an example of this. Kind Regards

What I am telling here is how to drive the car. You don't need to know how it works in order to drive it. We can trade Gann without going into all the "hooplah".

Awesome ILP, price has rebounded sharply off of that Fibonacci spiral ? from the last bar shown. Also I really liked that Math of God video you posted. It put a much deeper light onto things I have know about for many years. I am following this closely. I love to drive cars.

i've mentioned this before, but I think the optimum utilization of this indicator is to not use the AutoTF hi low but manually drag the red bar so that you get to choose the high and low points like so:

Fair enough. I personally use fixed percentage risk per trade and calculate lot sizes accordingly, favouring all in -all out, rather than scaling in and out. However, I'll consider alternatives if you have a specific method that you want to discuss. Cheers

... now ILP too and all other contributors. I just read through the thread this morning and it is a gem. Very generous of you all to share so much. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Well, that is also a form of moneymanagement. Everyone has their own "comfort zone", nothing wrong with that. My suggestion is to use this EA with all your trades. You can set it anyway you like it. I downloaded it somewhere from this forum a while ago. Gann was very firm about using a stoploss.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
OK, time to add the next tool to the mix. Gann used a SQ9 technique to determine S/R. He squared the price fixed it to an aspect e.g., 90, 180, 270, 360 degrees and used those levels to determine buy/sell signals. Well, along comes this crazy mathemathician named Murrey and he basically figured out the same thing a different way. His levels are very usable for trading and coincide with the Gann levels almost exactly. So, as I said, sound has 8 octaves. Light has 7 different colors when you break it down. Gann has 8 lines, Murrey has 8 levels. It is very simple, When price gets closer to 7 or 8, a turn down can be expected. When price is closer to 1 or 2 a turn up can be expected. At either extreme a 50% retrace can be expected. 50% was Gann's favorite number. In Murrey Math it means the [4/8] level or 4th harmonic. Attached is the indi. Please experiment and backtest.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thanks for the link, I will have a look at that. I have always used a hard stop loss. I know some like to use mental stops and other methods, but that is not for me. With regard to one of your earlier posts, you mentioned using pythagoras - care to elaborate a little on that? It is an area that I have only recently started to research and find it interesting, so I would interested to read your take on it...

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I have been using Murrey's lines for some time.. I'll post later on what each line means.. It's really good that we have ILP and all the others here to contribute and let us all learn bit by bit

--- 帖子 #212 ---
8/8 th's and 0/8 th's Lines (Ultimate Resistance) These lines are the hardest to penetrate on the way up, and give the greatest support on the way down. (Prices may never make it thru these lines). 7/8 th's Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse) This line is weak. If prices run up too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse down fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move up to the 8/8 th's line. 6/8 th's and 2/8 th's Lines (Pivot, Reverse) These two lines are second only to the 4/8 th's line in their ability to force prices to reverse. This is true whether prices are moving up or down. 5/8 th's Line (Top of Trading Range) The prices of all entities will spend 40% of the time moving between the 5/8 th's and 3/8 th's lines. If prices move above the 5/8 th's line and stay above it for 10 to 12 days, the entity is said to be selling at a premium to what one wants to pay for it and prices will tend to stay above this line in the "premium area". If, however, prices fall below the 5/8 th's line then they will tend to fall further looking for support at a lower level. 4/8 th's Line (Major Support/Resistance) This line provides the greatest amount of support and resistance. This line has the greatest support when prices are above it and the greatest resistance when prices are below it. This price level is the best level to sell and buy against. 3/8 th's Line (Bottom of Trading Range) If prices are below this line and moving upwards, this line is difficult to penetrate. If prices penetrate above this line and stay above this line for 10 to 12 days then prices will stay above this line and spend 40% of the time moving between this line and the 5/8 th's line. 1/8 th Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse) This line is weak. If prices run down too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse up fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move down to the 0/8 th's line.

If I line up the Gann lines with the Brooky indi I get a small deviation in angle. We need to align the grid to the cycle. The cycle I am mentioning is Gann's earth rotation cycle. That is what the Gann lines represent. Also, if the Gann lines could be added, that would be great.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I did mention it, but we don't really need it. We could, but you would be in the business of forecasting again, instead of trading. Lets wait and see how it develops. More info is here: http://www.stockcyclesforecast.com/scfbk.html

--- 帖子 #215 ---
that would be fantastic, actual usable lines that are plotted on a pips/time basis a setting in the indicator to put the squaring ratio of choice would be a big plus too

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hey MoneyDeep, nice idea but Im afraid your calculations are wrong. Regards Hint: From 105,41 to 106,73 is a degree of 11,53 512° (not 45°) (SQRT(106,73) - SQRT(105,41)) x 180 = 11,53 512°

Thanks for the links Lotus. Personally I do not use the Gann grid tool - I use this ICCE indicator that I have been coding based on Bemac's work. The reason being that it is more flexible than the Gann grid. For example, I can decide to show only the rising diagonals and switch off the falling diagonals. Assuming Brooky comes back to the thread, I'll ask if he wants to use the same method instead of the Gann grid...failing that, I may write my own version....after improving the accuracy of the diagonals on the above mentioned indicator :nerd:

This thread looked interesting at the beginning when the whole astrology/planetary cycles thing could be overlooked... I mean... calculus is brilliant yet Newton was a practitioner of alchemy... So if we have the benefit of hindsight, knowing that there is mathematical significance to the levels that are predicted, whilst also knowing that financial astrology and astronomy is a load of wank, why are you guys adding it back?

We are using astronomy to measure time, because that is what we do on planet earth. Maybe you forgot about that. Remember, one day is one revolution of earth, takes 24 hours, 12 hours in a day, 12 in a night etc. Nobody here is using astrology. Astrology has to do with horoscopes and "feelings", astronomy with orbits and positions of planets. One is scientific the other is considered and art. Since there is nothing in the universe but science, we are using the scientific one but just to measure time, like mankind has done for many centuries now. Everything in the universe comes to an order, including the financial markets. That is what we are trying to profit from.

Once the name of the thread is Gann PVS (Price vibration System) Trading You have to, we discuss the elements of a trading system. Does anyone know what should have these items? When we determined they will be able to begin to describe them to OUR TS. Here's what he wrote in his book, James A. Hyerczyk

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I doubt that anybody has been scared away. Certainly cycles exist in the markets. The question is, How do you explain them? So if we can gain some insight or better yet a trading edge by using GANN or some other technique, this is good. I find this whole topic extremely interesting. Especially the GANN lines. I have been carefully considering the Square that the 1x1 line so elegantly represents. Very fascinating indeed when looking at historical price data. Thank you ILP

Exactly right Godim. A trend following system based upon Gann angle lines. We don't have to know where the trend turns, just that it has turned.

Hi Ilovepippin first of all thank you for your teaching and I might sound ignorant but how you get this white angled lines from bottom point? Is it indicator or you manually draws it? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I see some haste. They ask if it can, the money has already to come into balance. I think we have to go all the way step by step. Why do you try to skip the question I asked? I think the question is paramount. Imagine. Open a new chart of pair aud/usd. At what Time Frame? After short will give my opinion.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
My opinion is that we should use this Time frame in which there is no break in time. What do I mean? Forex is a market that works 5 days 24 hours. Gann has worked in the stock market. And she has not worked 24 hours, right? Gann has been featured daily chart. So I suggest basic graphics of our trading system to be daily chart. There will be continued.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
This is a graph of Gann. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let's look more odd. Attached Image (click to enlarge) We see the main divisions of time in four divisions. Below we see the working days of exchange corresponding to these divisions. The graph has a 6-day workweek. And are just days that exchange worked. There will be continued.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
looking at D1 has its merits but looking for turns, M15, M5 may be needed. stop loss associated with bigger framer moves will be at levels different from those short term. the issue most people have is to identify when it turns or when it is going to hit the target. prices can overrun and overshoot esp. with the pump and dump activity. In any case, i believe there is no absolute certainty, it is question of raising confidence level and not looking for perfect system. i have used the fibo fann lines and before and at times, prices will hit and sometimes will serve to become resistance. in fact, i looked this for quite a while and noticed certain behvior and it is hard to explain. whether it is with gann, fibo, etc, it boils down to setting price and hitting the button when it matters, if we set a few targets, how would you place your sell price, it means we have to buy a few contracts or buy 1 contract and break the sell size at different levels. certain divergence pattern works, but you have to be there watching to catch it. What is the problem with big picture trading? I think will miss a lot of activites in between. When prices are sideways or ranging, and then it trends, the behaviors are different.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
From the above writings derive a few things. First . There are suppliers of quotations, which give details of the sixth bar a week. These graphics may NOT be used for our trading system. Data must be manipulated manually. Second . We can calculate the number of bars for each Time frame so that there is no break in time. For example, H4. Bars for a week = 5 days x 6 bars / day = 30 bars per week. For H1. Bars for a week = 5 days x 24 bars / day = 120 bars a week. Count bars for a week that you receive from your suppliers and determine which is the smallest Time frame without interruption in time. There will be continued.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I think you are in a hurry again. Let us know at what Time frame may draw fans of Gann. Many of you want to draw on the M15 and M5. I'm not saying he could not. However, be aware that things break on Friday and begin again on Monday. Depends on our supplier.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
They are manually drawn GANN lines.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
i am not using gann lines, i used to do that in stocks. now drawing gann lines in hourly and daily. not M5, 15. I am saying the stop loss depends on the time frame for trading.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I live in a country with a time zone GMT +2, now with DST - GMT +3. Here's how to run my day sessions. Attached Image My provider, however, closes one hour before the end of U.S. session on Friday. Thus the H1 for the week I have only 119 bars. Ie I have a break in the time and I can build a Gann Fan to H4.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I very well understand what you write. But you do not want to know. We can hardly begin discussing the second step. A determination of the stops are right in the third, right? I want to move step by step. I will not jump over. Everything will fall into its place, finally, I hope.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
So. These are my arguments basic graphic of our trading system to be a daily chart. I will be happy to hear your opinion. I apologize to makefortune if I had been more acute. Just I do not accept the arguments about the size of the stop.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Would it negate the value of the Gann angle lines if we assume a constant flow of price time? This would certainly fix any differences in feeds etc. But this would create lines that shift with every break in trading on our charts. I'll defer to ILP on this point. we don't want to over complicate a working system. Concerning time frames, The choice of time frames would seem to have more of an impact on the divergent oscillator used for confirmation than the angle lines. The angle lines should be very consistent across all time frames. So perhaps we should use a higher time frame to confirm trend change and then switch to a lower time frame to trigger an entry off of an angle line.

You said it. having confirmation and making the entry

We do not know how to build a Gann fan in MT4. But I want to put the next question. What are the possible extremes, from which must be build fans?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Gann used three types of swings chart. " One-Bar Swing Chart (1-Bar Swing Chart): The One-Bar Swing Chart, or Minor Trend Chart, follows the one-bar movements of the market. From a low price, each time the market makes a higher-high than the previous bar, a One-Bar trend line moves up from the recent low to the new high. This action makes the previous low price a One-Bar bottom. From a high price each time the market makes a lower-low than the previous bar, a One-Bar swing line moves down from the recent high to the new low. This action makes the previous high price a One-Bar top. The combination of One-Bar tops and bottoms forms the One-Bar trend indicator chart. The crossing of a One-Bar swing top changes the One-Bar trend to up. The penetration of a One-Bar swing bottom changes the One-Bar trend to down." " Two-Bar Swing Chart (2-Bar Swing Chart): The Two-Bar Swing Chart, or Intermediate Trend Chart, follows the two-bar movements of the market. From a low price each time the market makes a higher-high than the previous bar for two consecutive time periods, a Two-Bar trend line moves up from the low two bars back to the new high. This action makes the low price from two bars back a Two-Bar Swing Bottom. From a high price each time the market makes a lower-low than the previous bar for two consecutive time periods, a Two-Bar trend line moves down from the high two bars back to the new low. This action makes the high price from two bars back a Two-Bar Swing Top. The combination of Two-Bar swing tops and bottoms forms the Two-Bar trend indicator chart. The crossing of a Two-Bar swing top changes the Two-Bar trend to up. The penetration of a Two-Bar trend bottom changes the Two-Bar trend to down." " Main Trend : The main trend swing chart follows the three-bar movements of the market from a low price each time the market makes a higher-high than the previous bar for three consecutive time periods, a main trend line moves up from the low three bars back to the new high. This action makes the low price from three bars back to a main bottom. From a high price each time the market makes a lower-low from the previous bar for three consecutive time periods, a main trend line moves down from the high three bars back to the new low. This action makes the high price from the three bars back a main top. The combination of main swing tops and bottoms forms the main trend indicator chart. The crossing of the main swing top changes the main swing to up. The penetration of a main swing bottom changes the main trend to down. Depending on trader preference, sometimes a two-bar swing is used to determine the main trend." Source: http://patternpricetime.com/

It will be great if our chart has these swings.

We must construct fans of each extreme. Imagine what will look like the graph. Probably will not see the price, right? For me it is clear that there is no need to build fans of One-Bar Swing Chart. If you build a fans only Main Trend may have little support/resistance. Here I show that notorious sheet that Gann wrote "Use 2 day charts and rules better than 3 day". Attached Image And pass only the Two-Bar Swing Chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Quite tired today. We will continue another day.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I thought we wanted the 15m timeframe, but this works on all TFs. We ideally enter after a failed "new high or low". In EW terms this would be wave 2 or B. There are several indi's that give a signal. I have an indi that gives alternate buy/sell signals but this needs modification because ideally we reach an entry and lets say we are selling, then we keep selling on retraces as long as it keeps the trend. The difference with this method vs others is that when we enter against the "prevailing" trend in a wave 2 or B we can do so with a short stop and avoid the trap that other trendfollowing systems have since the majority of those systems would go with the trend on a "strong" buy/sell since all indi's that are trendfollowing are showing a strong trend. I would not use the swing indicator. It clogs up the screen.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
This is interesting, as usual, we wait for a pullback and then follow the wave. however, there are times, it just shoot up. for the pattern you just described, it sure makes sense if your indicator can differentiate versus the commonly trend following indicator. Visually, we just have to count or differentiate

Congratulations to everyone who has animated this forum in the last few days related to this trade. I can see that the trade is called PVS ( Price Vibration System ) but up until this point the postings were made especially through the Gann Trend Structure Analysis Technique - Swing chart also have been followed related to the price cycles.Unfortunately, nothing, or almost nothing about the vibration of the price and the law of vibration.I eagerly await for this subject to be approached also.Good luck to everyone.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Trading is not without risk. You will lose trades. However, we have to use indicators in order to minimize the risk and get into high probability trades. First we need some coding done to some indi's. - MACD divergence - Vertical Grid - Gann lines This in addition to moneydeep indi.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
From what I understand the moneydeep indicator is such a tool. From what I see it uses a technique similar to what Jenkins is using by measuring the initial uptrend and calculating turning points from there. Maybe you should look into that.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I know it's not very "gann-like" but observing the PVS system paired with HA candles gives good idea about trend and shows some good entries at the blue doji stars

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I have run the deepmoney stuff that generate the Gann lines and grids automatically, I notice that the line does not match turning points. I have tried to adjust and pull the ControlBar, but it goes back to where it was after a while. If I turn of the autoTFHiLos, the gann levels do not show up. What is it that I need to do?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
turn off the Auto HiLo option in the indicator settings near the current candle on the chart should be a vertical red bar, when you double click the bar two endpoints and one midpoint should appear. drag the end points to the hi and low you like, then double click the chart to deselect the line. you can wait for MT4 to refresh or manually right click and refresh the chart to see the new grid. if you switch TFs you're gonna have to re do the red bar again, and manually delete the other TF red bar since it doesn't automatically disappear also like to add that one should play with the cycle #, it's set default at 34, but check out this chart with it set at 55, the second chart is a line version zoomed out so you can see past activity. magical numbers

Yes. Matei! Matei us back to the first step of the process. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...70#post5590370 Can anyone give a definition of PVS (Price Vibration System)? It is good in this relation we to have agreed. Otherwise it is pointless to continue I with explanations. Explanations that you will not take in general.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I found the definition of vibration on Wikipedia. "Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration We must disregard the mechanical definition. Because the price is something imaginary. So I alter the definition. "Vibration is a phenomenon whereby oscillations the price occur about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic or random."

“From my extensive investigations, studies and applied tests, I find that not only do the various stocks vibrate, but that the driving forces controlling the stocks are also in a state of vibration” “Stocks, like atoms, are really centres of energies. Therefore, they are controlled mathematically…. There is no chance in nature because mathematical principles of the highest order lie at the foundation of all things” “The power to determine the trend of the market is due to my knowledge of the characteristics of each individual stock and a certain grouping of different stocks under their proper rates of vibration. Stocks are like electrons, atoms and molecules, which hold persistently to their own individuality in response to the fundamental Law Of Vibration…. After exhaustive researches and investigations of the known sciences, I discovered that the Law Of Vibration enabled me to accurately determine the exact points to which stocks or commodities should rise and fall within a given time. The working out of this law determines the cause and predicts the effect long before the Street is aware of either” these are all quotes of W.D. Gann. essentially, he believed that the behavior of commodity and stock prices could be mathematically determined based on research of past data that determined the unique vibration frequency this could be approached in a variety of manners, visually from drawing Gann fan trendlines to mathematical calculations of price from square of 9 (or in this case, an excel sheet with the appropriate formulas) the indicator for this PVS system provides mathematical calculations of potential price levels based on your input of hi and low data points, and a Gann grid is provided to plot potential turning points in the future (once properly calibrated)

" I soon began to note the periodical recurrence of the rise and fall in stocks and commodities. This led me to conclude that natural law was the basis of market movements. I then decided to devote ten years of my life to the study of natural law as applicable to the speculative markets and to devote my best energies toward making speculation a profitable profession. After exhaustive researches and investigations of the known sciences, I discovered that the law of vibration enabled me to accurately determine the exact points at which stocks or commodities should rise and fall within a given time. " " The law which I have applied will not only give these long cycles or swings, but the daily and even hourly movements of stocks. By knowing the exact vibration of each individual stock I am able to determine at what point each will receive support and at what point the greatest resistance is to be met ." " Stocks are like electrons, atoms and molecules, which hold persistently to their own individuality in response to the fundamental law of vibration. [...] From my extensive investigations, studies and applied tests, I find that not only do the various stocks vibrate, but that the driving forces controlling the stocks are also in a state of vibration. These vibratory forces can only be known by the movements they generate on the stocks and their values in the market. Since all great swings or movements of the market are cyclic, they act in accordance with periodic law ." " If we wish to avert failure in speculation we must deal with causes. Everything in existence is based on exact proportion and perfect relationship. There is no chance in nature, because mathematical principles of the highest order lie at the foundation of all things. Faraday said, " There is nothing in the universe but mathematical points of force ." " Vibration is fundamental: nothing is exempt from this law. It is universal, therefore applicable to every class of phenomena on the globe. " " Through the law of vibration every stock in the market moves in its own distinctive sphere of activities, as to intensity, volume and direction; all the essential qualities of its evolution are characterized in its own rate of vibration. Stocks, like atoms, are really centres of energy; therefore, they are controlled mathematically. Stocks create their own field of action and power: power to attract and repel, which principle explains why certain stocks at times lead the market and 'turn dead' at other times. Thus, to speculate scientifically it is absolutely necessary to follow natural law ." " After years of patient study I have proven to my entire satisfaction, as well as demonstrated to others, that vibration explains every possible phase and condition of the market. " W.D.Gann

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Sorry to say it. Guys, you are responsible only blah-blah. Give it a comprehensive law of vibration. I hope finally a series of posts dedicated price vibration to have the definition given by Gann. I'm sure you know the definition. Now I ask you: do you agree with the definition of vibration of the price written below? "Vibration is a phenomenon whereby oscillations the price occur about an equilibrium point. The oscillations may be periodic or random."

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I continue. In order to enable us to predict the vibrations of the price we must know the points of oscillation and the law under which oscillations are made. Right? Gann offers a way to determine these points - these are swing charts. And Gann offered through these points to build lines of fans from different angles. Finally Gann wrote a rule that describes the price oscillation between these lines. That is: " Rule of All Angles : Another important guideline is what Gann called the Rule of All Angles. When a market breaks an angle, it will move toward the next angle. This is because as time passes, an angle’s importance weakens and the market eventually breaks through. Therefore a market breaking the 2 x 1 angle will begin to move toward the 1 x 1 angle; just as a market breaking the 1 x 1 angle will eventually reach the 1 x 2 angle. Conversely, in an up move, an angle that holds the 1 x 2 angle is likely to rally to the 1 x 1, just as overtaking the 1 x 1 is likely to lead to a rally to the 2 x 1."

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Godin,I have posted the definitions of Gann referring to the Law of Vibrations not to "bla bla" on the forum but to understand clearly what was the point of view of Gann related to a concept which he introduced in the technical analysis,and I am also convinced that there are many who cannot clearly define what is a point of force and how it can be determined mathematically.I think that it is necessary every once in a while that we go back to the fundamental texts of Gann if we wish to know his works precisely.Related to your question,practically you are asking me if I agree with the basic laws of physics,thus the question is a rhetorical one.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I do not believe random. Random is a fiction, just like freedom. It is an idea that exists in the mind only. "Vibration is a measurable phenomenon whereby oscillations of price occur about an equilibrium point or points. The oscillations are periodic and are subject to multiple periods."

--- 帖子 #263 ---
All right. The question now is only one vibration has there price? Clearly, there are other points of oscillation. And we can build by the rules of Gann and another fan.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Matei, nothing personal. Just Gann spoke and wrote very veiled. I understand difficult English. I read several times quotes. And I found only this: "After exhaustive researches and investigations of the known sciences, I discovered that the law of vibration enabled me to accurately determine the exact points at which stocks or commodities should rise and fall within a given time." "By knowing the exact vibration of each individual stock I am able to determine at what point each will receive support and at what point the greatest resistance is to be met." "After years of patient study I have proven to my entire satisfaction, as well as demonstrated to others, that vibration explains every possible phase and condition of the market." There is no definition.

I'm not sure if they multiply so much can they finally determined. But well I can accept the amendment. I know that all we'd like oscillations are even harmonics, but the reality is different.

This is not my work. I archived it because, I worried it would disappear from view. Sure enough the forum it was posted to is now gone, perhaps never to return. http://www.myfreakin.com/archives/16 Good Trading! SY

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Godim,I agree that Gann had an elliptic mean of presenting things,sometimes difficult to understand even for those who know english very well.In many passages of his works, Gann uses a metalanguage and understanding or decrypting it requires solid mathematical,physics,astrology,numerology,sacred geometry knowledge.About the quoted parts which you have underlined, as I have said in my previous post,they are Gann's perspective related to the law of vibration. If we read them carefully we will find important keys. For example Gann said that: a)Each financial instrument has its own vibration. b) Knowing specific vibration of a financial instrument help us determine in which point they will find support or resistance. c)Knowing the vibration allows us to understand the structure of the market,in which phase it is found and in which phase the market is in. I underline,not in the strict meaning of the definition but in the definition of the concept of vibration. Obviously this is only my point of view,and each can approach things in his own way.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Because these vibrations, we assume that part of the EW theory, we can expect the influence of more distant (in time) points of the oscillation. For example, in eur/usd 1.6036 top fan. Constructing geometric angles is easy, interpreting them is a little harder but not impossible. It is my view on the issue of PVS (Price Vibration System). Finish step one again. You can continue with the selection of TF. Then swing charts (these questions have already passed them). Can I continue on with the next question from step two?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Well, Matei. How you interpret this sentence: a) Each financial instrument has its own vibration. What do you think is the vibration of the instrument eur/usd, for example?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Nirestein said:-To measure its frequency of oscillation or vibratory rate which never changes (going from High to Low). The result is just to get a matematical number from any chart. To get a chart Pitched(slope) True- so that a 45 degree angle is really 45 degree. Go to historical chart, take the highest price point, subtract price of Snap- Back to Declining Tops line. Take the number of Trading Days from High point to Snap-Back point. Getting arihmetic of 1 x 2 line= (p1-p2)/trading days ex 400-300)/200=100/200=.5 units per day. So the 1x2 angle has a value of .5 units per day- Doubling it will give you the 1x1, which is 1 price unit per day. This is the way you scale price units on chart. "rising above the 1x2 angle puts commodities in a strong position where strong rallies should ensue"-W.D.Gann Once you have a True Pitched chart-find price Symmetry above and below the Nodal Line .Using a compass, swing High and Low symmetrically around the X axis (price). This will NOT work on a Non-Piched True chart. Breaking one angle takes you down to the next angle-this is where you expect to find support.Does Not mean there will be a Change of Trend, but just Support. 1x2 angle: once you break it, you will return to the Base therefore, the 1x2 angle is called the "Death Angle"

Hi, I had hoped that all those interested in the application of Moneydeeps gann S/R lines, would have continued with the premise that we now find a mathematical way of locating the turning points in relation to time. However it is obvious that certain elements have decided to ignore this aspect and push their own ideas and the usual mass of stuff that can be found on numerous websites and forums. So, as far as I am concerned this thread is no longer of interest, I shall continue to search for a mathematical solution to time. Allonso

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Alonso, You're right sorry if the discussion has deviated. Successful in your effort.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Two, three, even four questions are addressed in this post. If they are disjoint, can be easier to discuss. First. I accept that the vibration is measured by pips/day. This for me is the price factor over time. Some of the questions from step two. It is necessary for proper construction of the fans. Second. Described is the rule for all angles. And third and fourth. I think you and I have no fundamental differences here.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Allonso, the fact that the lines are horizontal as time off as a factor. Levels remain such until the end of the world. I think everyone will become rich in knowledge that can make money. But how do you explain that Gann Grid, that drawing is wrong . It's easier for me to show you how to build properly. Step by step.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
The next question I want to discuss is "what are the angles in a Gann fan in MT4" MetaQuotes provide the following information on page MT4. http://ta.mql4.com/linestudies/gann_fan I immediately tell you that this is not true. We will continue shortly with how Gann is plotted the fans.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Gann angles is plotted in the coordinates of two points. One point is the top / bottom of the swing chart. The second point has coordinates (1, 1) or (1, 2) and so on. Attached Image Meaningless disputes are what the exact values ​​of angles. They can consider the function atan (). Attached Image

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I genuinely hope people can pay a little bit attention to their reading. Regarding Gann angles or Gann Fan, it's all been very clearly explained in materials in a few simple sentences of a very clear example, within a book of about 99 pages including all the padding and appendix. The attached chart shows two sets of Gann angle lines: red and yellow. The red ones are drawn based on some of the discussion here that one has to take two low points A&amp;B(one original one snap back) and calculate the time inbetween. The yellow ones are calculated from one single point only, ie point A. You can see they're nearly identical. But which one can be identified much earlier, it's up to you to judge. Allonso, I don't think you should be disappointed. What they're saying is all very helpful if you have no previous knowledge on the Gann subject. And what's all the fuss about finding a turning point in time? What about a turning point in price? Do you think it's easier to set an order on your platform with a price to go long or short or easier to phone your broker and tell them to enter on your behalf once the clock hits 1430? I am not aware of any platform that can allow one to preset entry order by time only. Gann might seem all mysterious touting about time, and it plays with our psyche that the more mysterious it is the better or more fascinating it must be. Price is time, and time is also price, if one likes to quote Gann. Forget about all the philosophical issues about time, for trading purpose only, I will take price anyday and anytime.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
But this is not the problem with MT4. There are very different angles. This can be understood only if you work very precisely and have calculations with a calculator. For now, take it on trust. Later you will be able to see for yourself. 1. [90 - (45/8)] = 84.375 2. [90 - (45/4)] = 78.750 3. [90 - (45/3)] = 75.000 4. [90 - (45/2)] = 67.500 5. 45 = 45.000 6. 45/2 = 22.500 7. 45/3 = 15.000 8. 45/4 = 11.250 9. 45/8 = 5.625

--- 帖子 #279 ---
If we calculate tan() of these angles will receive and their coefficients. They differ from those used by Gann. Now occur the following problem. If you want to work with right angles of Gann, we must render the whole fan angle after angle. That means nine angles with different coefficients. And each of them can be curved in its own direction. I prefer to work with the fan of MT4, and add two lines of Gann for 2x1 and 1x2. The angles are 11.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
For those who read Russian. This is a link to an article in three parts describing the technique to using Fan of Fibonacci to build a fan of Gann. http://avladfx.livejournal.com/8418.html

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thank you Oshawa, this is the correct method and as I said before for Forex that translates to 1 day for 1 cent or 100 pips on a 4 digit platform. for the 1x1 or 45 degree angle (aspect). This needs to be added to the Moneydeep Indi. BTW. The moneydeep indicator does not let you move the line with the (HiLo) function on false. Maybe that can be fixed. Thanks. Matei: Gann used code language. Angle = Aspect, price = time So if you know the "angle" of a stock you will know where (at which price) it will turn (when time and price meet, and they meet at an angle) However, here we are trying to follow the trend until it turns. Buy when it goes up, sell when it goes down. In the end you get the same result as Gann. Gann knew when price was going to turn, but then he had to confirm the turn. That means he did not get into the market at the point that price and time met, but when he confirmed that it reacted according to his forecast. Well, you can do the same thing without the complicated forecast and get a high probability trade as I described earlier.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
This is not correct. As I also thought this when I first tried it. The control bar is very close to the last bar of the chart and is often difficult to see. There is another bar (not sure of its function) that you can not move. Also I have found that if you place the control bar from a High to a Low and take that price length and calculate the proper time length for a square and place that value into the Cycle_Bars parameter. You will get a near perfect 1x1 line. Any deviation is caused by fractional values.

Time for the next question, right? How to use MurreyMath levels for scale the price over time? To know everything you should read this article: http://tradinglib.com/indicators/murrey-math I want to note three things. 1. MurrayMath geometry is the development of the geometry of the square of Gann. 2. What are fractals? 3. The table of probabilities at the end of the article. How to calculate MurrayMath levels? You we will use the indicator? But how to calculate time in fractals is important. This will calculate the time. And then we will submit it to the indicator. Finally. If you fill in the table can get the probability of reversal for each leg. Attached Image

All this talk about angles seems unnecessary to me. Perhaps I can simplify this discussion. If you stack the squares either vertically or horizontally and draw the lines through the opposite corners you can derive all the angles.

Tomorrow we will continue. Maybe.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
This to me? If yes. You work on what platform? I'm talking about everywhere MT4. MT4 work with a dynamic scale. And what you have drawn for a moment now may be wrong. This should fix the scale. But let us move step by step.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
In MT4 if you draw a trendline that rises 100pips in 24 hours it will remain stable no mater what time-frame or scale that is being used as long as the two set points are within the chart. I thought we were fixing the price time scale?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I remembered something else. Often some draw lines in the "future". But MT4 rubs days Saturday and Sunday. At market opening on Monday. Not before. This may be a prerequisite for distortion. You should calculate the number of dates are not bars. This is a bonus.

Hi All. Originally I coded the first indicators to help MoneyDeep out and the thread has evolved into quite a discussion in many areas, probably because of it's misnomer as a price vibration system which tends to conjure up other ideas aside from Gann. Not a spot for newbies who are wanting the holy grail arrow but certainly a melting pot of ideas with much good information so a big thanks to all who have taken the time to post their ideas etc. As promised I am posting an indicator that has evolved from the original MoneyDeep levels. I am aware that there are divisions of thought about what is right and wrong re Gann levels angles etc and am sure that the indicator is both right and wrong depending on your point of view. I post it here to keep my word but as many are aware I do not trade specifically with this indicator and it is posted as a possible aid to those who use it. I do know of one high end trader who does use it effectively and sings it's praises. Thanks to those that have pm'd me and contributed to it's development. I simply do not have the time to support this indicator so please do not pm me or ask for changes as I am knee deep in other work, but the code is open and anyone with a bit of coding experience will be able to change anything as needed. I have also included an update to the range finder indicator. The color was not able to be reset and can be now. Inside the zip file is an instruction pdf on how to use the indicator. Please READ it before loading it. The instructions were written as I was doing V3, but apply to V4. You will need a ticker on weekends to make any sense of it. It's a monster of a thing, but once loaded it appears to settle down nicely. It is not the sort of indi you drag around the charts every minute. take the time to set it up and then work with it as a background map for a few days at a time. So with that said, success to all. Cheers Brooky.

What to do? We need to change the scale of the chart. To do this let us calculate the the scale of the price over time. How? Simply. take one unit of price and divide it one unit of time. A division of time is 32 days. We need to work with bars. For those of you who will try to M15. One division on the price is 10010 - 9766 = 244 pips. So the scale (vibration) is 244/32 = 7.625 pips/day How to use this? Let's build Gann Grid.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
We know that the grid lines are at an angle of 45 degrees. To add this Trend By Angle 45 degrees somewhere near line. The slope is quite different, right?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
The next step is to fix the scale of graph.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Moves vertically scale up / down until the lines match.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Voila. Perfect chart? Maybe ...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Now easily build true fan of Gann.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
We will continue next week. Saturday and Sunday? Let's trade a little, right? Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next question would be: "what is the relationship between the price range, duration of cycle and scale of the price?"

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Godim, это очень добрый и щедрый, большое спасибо. Это может быть легче с MT4 'cycle line':

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Care to elaborate as to how you calculate from a single point? Or, could you tell me to which book you are referring? I am intending to code a fan indicator, which I will share, so this information could be quite useful before I start.... Cheers

--- 帖子 #313 ---
This is an interesting question. And it falls right in the theme that I thought to consider next week. Think about how Gann is plotted charts. He is wait until the second peak/bottom is formed. And only then counted the coefficient? And when they has drawn the graph for one year calculated once a new scale and draws all over again?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
One day! Thank you for your offer of coding and sharing an indicator. Back in the other thread a few pages back I've recommended that Ferrera's SQ9 as the most worthy of hassle for people to read because it is very clearly written and well explained. Herewith the page where he explained how Gann angles/Fan is contructed with an example:

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thank you for the explanation Oshawa. Sounds straightforward enough...I think that I may include an option to either use that method, or manually enter the pips per bar. Will be a few weeks though, due to other commitments. Cheers

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I have tried various settings and read the pdf . but the latest version does not have cycle setting . i have tried pulling some of the grid lines but it just goes back to where it was and it is really tough figuring out the cycle bars, etc could you elaborate the steps to do this correctly? Thanks

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi Unless I am mistaken, I think the picture below is what you are after?? Cheers Brooky

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Many of you know the thread with the analysis of Gann. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...72196&amp;page=170 If any of you will dare to make a graphic by me described technique, we can discuss it in this thread.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I have changed the settings but I don't get the grid lines as per your AUDUSD example. depsite changing the time cycle bars to 460 or whatever number, the grid lines did not change, the Auto TfHiLos is set to false Arc ratio 20, cycle options - autocycle 8, autoTF2Use 1440

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Thanks brooky, I understand what went wrong.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Anyone got a script that once executed can send buy/sell orders as fast as they can execute on chart @market, be nice if you had a limiting option in settings to how many to pop to the server maybe a SL option as well??????

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Amazing job on the indicator, and very clear help file too. I just got a chance to take a look at it. You are not only gifted, but generous too. Thanks! ; )

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hi chaps, On Oshawas chart the 1x1 line cannot be scaled at 100pips/24hrs, 500pips/week, 2000pips/month etc? To do so would create a 1x1 that appears far steeper/vertical?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
PVS system gave me the heads up that EURUSD was overdue for a correction the cycle lines have been fairly accurate at indicating a change in trend and the gann lines show the downtrend angle

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I'm really not sure how to use the brooky's indicators correctly or understand the whole thing but with little knowledge, I just did some math with Price table and got this. Maybe (since I don't know that's why maybe) this will be what we'll be seeing today before we go up then down again with 35 circles and up to the top for May. 153 + 36 circles = 13113 152 + 36 circles = 13112 I don't know how Sq works but I think it was like that?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
i think the best use of this indicator is to manually pick the high and low points i try many different ones and see which seem to align with price action well not exactly sure how to use the arcs quite yet but looking into it

--- 帖子 #327 ---
kiranitoot - laid out a template kindly display setting ... thank you

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Seeing that this thread has evolved into indepth gann analysis I just wanted to say it doesnt have to be difficult. Everyone trades gann differently. I personally am using the first version of the indicator. I select a nice looking daily/weekly swing and trade 4hr timeframe. Different swings will give different harmonics. Theres no right or wrong.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
That's all on auto. I just followed the book. Turn on everything or make all false parameters to true. Combining this with the 1st version, we can clearly see the direction but I still don't know how.. lol

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I think it will be a pretty sweet ride back down in a few hours. Adding my strategy and Murrey on the chart. It looks like price is trying to push through to the 4/8ths on Murrey which is a Major support/resistance. Remember, price doesn't break these support/resistance on their first tries. By looking at stochs, we see that red line and yellow is above the blue line. it means that the market is in for a bearish trend. We also see that it's not yet over for the bulls as the market isn't overbought yet or isn't time to trade(atleast for me). By changing to manual on brooky's indi, I managed to get the view on my left side of the chart. The highest possible target for opening a short would be on 1.3240's or less or maybe not. I'm still learning how to use it but that's how I see it.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
It is certain that I am guilty. I rushed to your space and started asking the agenda. For that I apologize. I was misled by a few things. Now that enthusiasm has passed, I can give myself a clearer assessment. I was hoping, as a joke we write a few dozen rules for such a trading system. I see that on the contrary there is more opposition, not consensus. To which I am sorry. Once again I apologize to the author of the thread. His is the right to lead her in whatever direction he wanted.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
All the Gann information you've presented is right on and way deeper on your other thread. I don't know how you have the patience to teach it. I surely don't, because the knowledge of knowing how to trade Gann is overwhelming for most if not all traders. So why even bother? But kudos to you for at lease trying.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hello again. We understood that we could not finish the whole system. Let me finish the first instrument - fans of Gann. Stay a little, at least in my opinion. Recall. I showed a way to calculate the scale of the price in time with MurreyMath levels. While the price is within this range all calculations and built in are correct. But when the price out of range possible MurreyMath to change divisions. What to do in this case?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
We know that Gann is plotted graph on paper. Let us put ourselves for a moment in his place. We have a table with the daily OHLC. Somehow, depending on price range, we determine scale of the price. Suppose 10 cents per 1/8 inch. Putting the entire table or table part of the diagram. This is the graph until the beginning. Then every day inflict new data taken from the exchange. And let's assume that after one or two years the price out of range. What to do now?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
What do traders on this thread? They define the scale of a single swing or even leg. This scale has a very local character. And it is reasonable to be covered by the next - more global, etc. Now let's get back on quotations of Gann by Matei. After 10 years, Gann is certain vibrations (scale) in most markets. Today we would take much shorter time. We have computers with databases and whatnot.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I use the divisions of MurreyMath to determine the price scale. I ask one-year interval of the cycle and MutteyMath determine the range in price. This occur difficulty for the Study of the price range for one-year interval of past times. Because the indicator is designed to calculate from the current time ago. In other words I can not determine price range for the one-year interval for the date 31/12/2011. But this difficulty can be overcome by using the Strategy Tester. Set a daily graphics and the last date 31/12/2011. On the resulting graph place indicator MurreyMath for one year. So you can explore the one-year price range back to this one, until you price information. Finally, we must decide what the scale of the price over time (vibration).

--- 帖子 #337 ---
In eur/usd I calculated level of 15.25 pips/day. Accept it for the all cases of change of the price range. Like Gann's charts was plotted on paper. Then the calculations are different. Let's take the current situation. The price range has shrunk so that one division was 244 pips. Because I want to keep the scale of 15.25 pips/day. Calculate a new length of the cycle. [244/15,25] x 8 = 16 x 8 = 128 days.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
This does not mean that I change the time for calculating MurreyMath. Just I expect the price to do two cycles a year. Something like that described in the book of James A. Hyerczyk. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And these are the last few cycles on my chart. On Friday ended the last, which could lead to a decrease in price. Now I've marked the beginning of the cycle from the bottom 1.2624. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Last week the market was so good as to show us a good move in the angles of Gann. My merit is only to show this in thread. Twice the price reaches the angle 3x1. Both times we knew the level in time. The first time an accuracy of one pip, and the second with only 2 pips difference. This chart can you trade?

The more I observe this chart, the more I like this indicator See the major recent correction to the downsloping gann grid line? This was drawn from swing low of 4/16 and swing high of 4/20. I would say by 4/23 one would've confidently been able to identify as 4/20 being a high (no pun intended lol) not to mention piercing of the arc as an high and drastic trend change almost at the cycle line

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi All, I owe a debt of gratitude to one particular trader who has pursued me to understand the V4 indicator. Without his dogged persistence the following problem would never have been found. Interesting to see that Neuron's chart above exhibits the problem perfectly but it is a little talked about or known anomaly in MT4. The issue lies with the different way that MT4 scales Arcs and Ellipses between 4 and 5 digit brokers. We are all aware of the point difference this cause re price, but certainly to myself ... and I can guarantee to many other coders not the scaling issue. The effect is that as per Neurons chart above, if you are using a 5 digit broker, the arcs and ellipses are all squashed horizontally and extended far to the left and right. The same chart that Neuron has would appear totally different with the circles being round and squared correctly to the box. This of course makes a huge difference re Gann trading. The solution has been found and I have added an automatic feature in this update so that irrespective of your broker, the arcs will/should display correctly. I suggest the lights will suddenly go on for many traders who are using the indi on 5 digit brokers. Another point that came out of my discussions with this trader was that people need to pay attention to the comments to achieve correct squareness. I have added the tpl of the chart below to help someone understand what settings are needed to achieve the result on chart. Other settings of course are square as well such as an 84 pip box height, 42 size cycle and Auto cycle of 2. It's just a question of ratios. Place the tpl on AUDUSD H1 and have a look at the settings as a matter of interest. The picture is on Oanda 5 Digit broker. Cheers Brooky

not sure what is right ...

Hey Brooky, Awesome job you did. Just wondering whether I used it correctly.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi All, It has come to my attention from aforementioned diligent trader who watches over me that the MoneyDeepLevelsAutoShadedV4.1.mq4 ( last version) indeed works much better re scaling, but has an issue with larger time frames. H4. Daily etc in displaying relevant timely arcs. The reason for this is that the indi was originally designed with the 1 pip 1 bar squaring idea and other logic layered over that. The above is not an issue in timeframes up to H1 where there are plenty of bars and most pullbacks measured are somewhere around the 100 - 200 pip range. The square simply expands to that amount of bars. In Daily though, ranges over 1000 + are often measured and that means that one firstly needs a large amount of bars in Daily history, and the arcs can span many weeks ahead. Too much so in fact to feel confident about using these Daily levels or Arcs in analysis. Therefore the indicator has been enhanced to offer scaling in the pips to bar area. This in essence means that you can square off a 1000 pip range over for eg a 100 bar time range and generate much tighter but perfectly squared Arcs that are much more relevant as opposed to the 1 to 1 scaling previously where you needed 1000 bars to square. The actual amplitude of the arcs has been brought out of code as an option that should not need to be changed but gives one the ability too should one wish to. You will see additions in the options as below. For larger tf's, just change the PipBarRatio option and everything else will/should :-) adjust. Comments have been enhanced to include this information. extern string PipBarNote1 = "One means square to 1bar per pip"; extern string PipBarNote2 = "4 means square to 1 bar per 4 pips"; extern string PipBarNote3 = "Set 10 for Daily TF Recommended"; extern int PipBarRatio = 1; // Set to 10 as eg for daily. Arc scaling that should NOT need to be changed. extern string ScaleNote1 = "4 digit Brokers..EllipseScale = 1"; extern string ScaleNote2 = "4 digit Brokers..ArcScale = 1"; extern string ScaleNote3 = "5 digit Brokers..EllipseScale = 0.1"; extern string ScaleNote4 = "5 digit Brokers..ArcScale = 10"; extern string ScaleNote5 = "Can Custom Scale To Suit"; extern double SetEllipseScale = 0.1; extern double SetArcScale = 10; The indicator and a tpl on AUDUSD Daily are attached below so you can see how the settings can work. The 1st example picture below shows what can be achieved in Daily now that was impossible before. The 2nd example is of how the settings now could work in a projected Daily mode where we make the square incomplete ( therefore the Gray square hides to the left ) while the arcs and epicentre are projected forward. You will also notice in the second picture that the cycles per square are set at 3 instead of the traditional 2 or 4. I encourage traders to have two charts set the same tf's etc, but one with either the 2nd or 4th harmonic and the other with the 3rd or 5th harmonic. It is a known natural occurance that these harmonic cycles will alternate as time progresses. You will find yourself with many more trading opportunities if you pay attention to which harmonic price is respecting at that point in time. If you really want, you can add the minor 7th harmonic and you will have the majority of twists and turns, pullback's etc nailed that the market can offer. Confluence of these harmonics is as powerful as Fibonacci confluence, but in reality they are all tapping into the same Vibe. Many possibilities are now available within the indicator and hopefully this last release should cater for most needs.

Hi all. If someone is trading different instruments than Forex, there are settings that can be changed to display most of them into a tradeable format as the pip values can be extreme. Just to help in case the settings are confusing some, I have attached two tpl's of H4 and Daily S&amp;P_500 as a starting point to consider when setting your own charts that you can evaluate to see how the scaling etc options have been used and squaring is preserved.

Brooky is the AUDUSD template applicable to other currency pairs or is it limited to only AUDUSD...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi The template was designed to show how to achieve certain scaling and I only used AUDUSD because it was open. If you want to use the same settings on eg: H1 EURUSD, all you have to do is open your EURUSD chart and apply the AUDUSD template. At that point it will make no sense at all because the control bar is set to AUDUSD prices. Right click the chart and select Objects. Find the ControlBar object and select edit. Just enter in some prices you can see on your chart to get the control bar on screen somewhere in front of you. Then drag it to some relevant points and all the scaling etc of the AUDUSD template is intact. Then save the template as EURUSD_H1 or so and you will not have to do it again. Pics below of the change and the new EURUSD chart using the AUDUSD template. Cheers Brooky Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Well I plumped for pips per bar in the end..... Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think that the use of the indicator is fairly straightforward, but I have put a short video together to demonstrate setting up etc,. The one grey area is deciding on how many pips per daily bar to use, that I'll leave to the individual...referring to the video you will see that I used 10pips on the EURUSD chart, however, some of the lower timeframes will need different values - 10pip per day on a 1min chart is too flat in my opinion. On the subject of different timeframes, I would recommend setting up the fans on the timeframe that you want to use them - it is possible to drop down and go up, but this exposes the issue with bar open times - a bar open time on one timeframe may not be present on another timeframe. Anyway, try it out if you like and let me know if you find any bugs....

--- 帖子 #362 ---
do you adjust the pips per day bar for different times for one pair. eg. when the price movement has become sharper in the past weeks , the moves would be bigger versus when it is ranging

--- 帖子 #363 ---
After the rays are setup, I try to move them, but i end up dragging one line instead of the bunch of the lines at the location. Did I miss something in your demo?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
amazing. beeing trying to get gann but am amazed by this indicator. cool

--- 帖子 #365 ---
OneDay, thank you. Very user-friendly.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thank you very much One Day! !!! it will be very usefull for me!

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Dude! This is great!

--- 帖子 #368 ---
From my observations so far, I would change the pips per day only if the fans and price were obviously out of scale, not because of ranging and trending conditions. As I understand it, if the scaling is accurate, then the price action and the fans should relate to each other,...but I am still learning too

--- 帖子 #369 ---
It sounds as though you may have selected one of the trendlines instead of the price marker. They are quite fiddly to select but if you hover your mouse over the right of the marker you should see a little info box with the name of the object - the markers and trendlines have different names. When you have selected the marker, you just move that to the required location. The speed at which the fan redraws is entirely dependent on incoming ticks, so if the market is slow, just use the standard chart refresh. Hope the above clarifies?...

--- 帖子 #370 ---
thank you! so much easier than manually drawing fans

--- 帖子 #376 ---
This works even when distorted. Use line through two points. However, I advise you to straighten scale.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Godim, I very like Your posts about Gann, but I do not understand everything: what do You mean straighten the scale? Can You explain me two things: 1. Why Your chart is diffrent then mine desplite the same swings used? I used 10 pips a bar scale. 2. How many pips per bar should I use if I want to apply this indicator on D1 chart of AUD/USD? How to calculate it? Thank in advance sir, I'm looking forward to this. Take care, Seb

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Yes there is a difference in the coefficient. I use 15,25 pips/day. But I'm talking about the scale of the graph. 1x1 angle is always 45°. How do I explain with graphics. Euro, pound, NZD and AUD I work with 15,25.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Thx for Your answer. I'm still confused: this is my 15.25/day chart. Why it is diffrent then Yours? Regards, Seb

--- 帖子 #380 ---

--- 帖子 #382 ---
LOL, It does not tell me much.... Seb EDIT: Nevermind, it works now.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Godim, Why 15.25? What is wrong with 10? Seb

--- 帖子 #384 ---
The authors plotted the fan using the lines through two points. One is the point of beginning. The other is calculated for the current date and the corresponding coefficients of 1x1, 1x2, etc. So the graph is correct. But I am accustomed to look just like that. And the fans are symmetrical.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I have tried to explain it. It depends on a division of MurreyMath a daily chart for one year. Now this division is 244 pips. Two years ago was 488 pips. These 488 pips to divide them 1/8 year - or 32 days. And get pips 15.25 per day.

this input, i need 2 value angle.. but as jer21 said before, calculation not accurate..

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I found most if not all the murrey math indicator out there is flawed by design. Some wise ass who worked for a big brokerage firm tweaked the formula and put it out there to trick us traders. So, I rewrote the formula my self which took a couple of years and used different programmers to protect it. That's why I can't give it way. Hope you understand mate! Here's the indicator your looking for with two inputs. I'm not saying it doesn't work but its not as accurate as I would like it to be. The moneydeep indicator is your best hope for price vibration. Be careful of using it though, it's only the tip of the iceberg.

Hello fellow Gann followers. I bookmarked this thread a while back then forgot all about it. I'll get on something, then jump to something else, in regards to Gann related material. His stuff is so deep, yet so interesting. I'll definitively be trying these templates and indicators that have been uploaded on here. What a time saver they have to be. Look forward to testing them out. Here's one I drew up over the past couple of days. One picture is zoomed out and the other is zoomed in. I'm still trying to figure out the different angles and such. Thanks again for those that programmed and shared your stuff.

BROOKY If we are using the indicator, auto tf2use : true ...Should we set the indicator from 1440 to 60 even though it is true?

(from my post of 2014) first of all, as I wrote several years ago, thanks to the creator of MoneyDeepLevelsAutoShadedV4.2_600, very good to square the range. After so many years I understood some things and I'm able to use this indicator in the best way but I need some clarifications since English is not my language: 1) what is the red vertical line that appears on the right for? 2) I selected circle n1, how can I change the ratios? selecting the other circles as well doesn't change anything.. thanks in advance
