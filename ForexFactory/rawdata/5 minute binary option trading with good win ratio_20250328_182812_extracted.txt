Thanks for the share US_Fantacy. Please give us some more clear explanation in the rules. Do we need to place the trade in the second arrow? I mean for the buy, Ones the yellow arrow comes, we need to wait for the blue arrow and then on the close of the candle with arrow blue do we need to trigger the trade? Can you please let us know how long you have been trying this method? and whats your success rate? Thanks again :-) Regards, Paul.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
hi paul first u need to wait come yellow arrow. that yellow arrow came after candle closed .. after that same time u should receive both big arrow and tiny arrow together ..once u notice that u should enter without late... pls invest small screen time .. within 30 mints u will understand...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
hi guys pls include this indicators also.. else u will not receive big arrow .... one member update me he was not receiving the big arrow .. reason is this indi missing in the template .. first page also updated now .. thanks SLN

--- 帖子 #8 ---
hey us_fantasy, thank you for sharing your method! I just have 2 quick questions for a better understanding... When I like to enter a trade there has to be the big yellow arrow first, does this arrow appear on the candle open or close? And the second confirmation is the double arrow... does this one appear on the candle close or open? Can we trade such a szenario? Attached Image And last but not least... For how long do you trade this strategy and what is your win rate/account grow?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
My friend..great start Going to forward test it

--- 帖子 #10 ---
yes yellow comes after candle closed only .. it is not coming working candle ... double arrow is working for adx power .. if u have knowledge adx indicator in default mt4 ,then u know the answer ..

--- 帖子 #11 ---
i know lot of people looking gold spoon bring things ..they at least not testing using demo account and asking same questions...how many win trades ,how long do u doing this , wat is ur capital now ? is this profitable ? and bla bla bla i think those are emotions question .. try this with demo and if u felt not gud then leave it.. even though i thought i must provide some screen shot in my live account .. it was profitable to me.may be not for u .. i will hide my lot size and amount .. plus marks shows win trades and minus marks shows loss trades .. thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
thank u mate ..

--- 帖子 #13 ---
here is another . hope u will happy..

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Any alert? hard to sit in front of computer all day long

--- 帖子 #15 ---
cheers mate, I know these kind of questions are more than emotional but unfortunately I haven't found a BO broker who offers demo trading, thats why I asked those questions before I put some money in

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Nice work man, thanks a lot. I think we need an Alert when the yellow arrow pops out, in other to get us ready. I am %50000000000000 subscribed

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thank you, us fantasy. I'm using on a live nadex account. Looking really good so far.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hello, U.S. fantasy. Thanks for sharing. Just a question. Do the arrows repaint?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi. I have only one question. Does any of the indicators in this system repaint?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
marketsworlds,optiontrade,binary(dot)com.... there are many brokers provide demo accounts .. pls use demo account until u practice this trading system .. some forex brokers also provide binary option trading .. gomakrts,roboforex,instaforex many are there .. i think u need to do some hard home works ... gud luck!!!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
i think if we luck to get coders help then coder can include alert to it mate .. because that sma crossover indi is mql4 file.. so hope some one will do it

--- 帖子 #22 ---
thanks mate

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Here is the same ADX Crossing ind. with alerts. Only one difference - it shows dots, not arrows

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi everyone. Looks like on the surface almost all the correct trades win. The problem is getting to them quick enough and placing the trade, but will keep trying on a few pairs. Because of the slow number of trades that can be caught I think you would have to bet high stakes. An audible alarm and pop up window would be nice on the appearance of the yellow arrow as a member has previously stated. Perhaps someone who can program could be approached to develop this function. Cheers

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Will try your indicator.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
would be good to trade binary options directly from mt4 for that... anyone knows a good broker for that ? i found out you can use this for 15 min timeframe too and then get 10 or 15 minute options, for those of us who can't handle the 5 mins...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi U S nice to see you, good thread,

--- 帖子 #29 ---
The dots don't line up with the arrows so the settings must be different. Would need to experiment or perhaps copy the settings if applicable.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I like this indicator because I can change not only ADX period, but also ADX level settings: 0-25 level - no trend; 25-40 trend; 40&gt; - very strong trend. I think it can filter bad signals in the better way.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
thanks for ur sharing .. now have free time to check ur indi..

--- 帖子 #32 ---
hi us fantasy, firstly thx for your share and secondly, about your system, if i understand well, we have to check (first arrow yellow) the first seconds after previous candle closed if the 2 arrows small green and big blue ? so it's useless to backtest in past of chart if it works ? only possible in testing in realtime ?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I would have to disagree with your statement about having to take large risk. If you simply risk about 7% of your total account value per trade, if you win you would earn about 5% of your total account value once the contract expires. 5% a day is about 100% per month. Not to mention black swan events will not affect your account in binary options as it does in normal mt4 trading.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
If we receive signals after 3-4min from 2 adx(3 and 5) after yellow arrow close, is it valid yet ? after how many secondes (minute(s)) on the second bar is still valid another question : What about expiry time ? when we open a call/put, it must closed on same bar or with next bar ? or 300seconds ? thnak you Us fantasy ps : is it possible to add number of price in the alert please ?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hey fantasy, I code EA with your strategy and trade directly via API from signalPUSH. Can you give me your skype and we can make together some better version. Happy Trading Luka

--- 帖子 #36 ---
name it the holy binary'ail :-)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hi, it really show a clear enter trade signal but how can i know when have to exit the trade?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
us_fantasy: your strategy looks promising, but witch BO broker lets you enter option anytime during the active expiry candle and its not a scammer on the other hand? Which one do you use? Although your 70% payouts are pretty low. Marketsworld will not let me to entr an option during the expiry candle.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I am using dukascopy for trading binary + forex. I think for me is best broker .

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Dukascopy looks really good, but options expiry after 5min countdonw, not at the close of the current 5min candle, which is needed for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
with binary.com you can choose your position in sec/min/hour/daily retire time already gone and go for the rest

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Please let's all talk about how to put an Alert on this indicator and how to improve i, we are wasting soo much time. Remember time they say is money.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
you can trade with cedar finance. they offer "turbo trades" when you hit the sell or buy button the time starts to run backwards

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Yep, but both binary.com or cedar are not suitable for this strategy. They dont have expiry in the real time of candle close, but after countdown of 5 min from your entry time. Lets see what recommendation us_fantasy will have for us.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yes so you start the countdown at the 5 min candle open...where is the problem??? 4x

--- 帖子 #46 ---
As I see from backtests, most trades are open during forming of the 5min candle and according to the rules the option should be closed at close of the candle. Most SMA crossover arrow (probably all) are plotted backwards, during the forming of the entry candle too. ADX arrow are plotted sometimes after half of the candle, sometimes even later. So we need a broker who will let as enter during the entry candle forming with expiry at its close. Maybe Us_fantasy will clear this up, anyway I'm currious about his broker in any case.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi all I have downloaded all relevant files into my broker's MQL4 folder - template into template folder, and indicators all into the indicators folder. Then clos3ed and reopened my broker's forex terminal (a live trading account) but cannot open the template or indicators in a new 5m chart. I won't be trading live but want to see the running of this scheme on several choice charts. BUT it won't go!! What's wrong here? I don't have a problem loading a new indicator into other charts but these ones and the template - no go at all. Help, please. Cheers, Larney

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Incidently, I use the same forex charts to follow and trade both forex and binaries.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
i cant send pm to u .. may be u turn ur off pm section ... check it and tell me mate ..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
u not need to do any thing after enter because binary option automatically closed .. we call it "expire time "

--- 帖子 #51 ---
im using marketsworlds ..... one of my mate told me 24option is another gud brokrer .. they have 15 sec options ... LOL... yes 70% is low but i checked mostly brokers paying 65%-85% for currency trading.... if u found more higher pay broker then update here ... after train ur knowledge u can enter the proper time in during expire candle using markets worlds ..

--- 帖子 #52 ---
mate how much u get paid from dukascopy broker ? are they paid more than 85%?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
fantasy, my PM not turned off!! I think you got me confused with another subscriber. Cheers Larney

--- 帖子 #54 ---
we can use two techniques to the above mention problem ..i will tell wat im doing for this problem...one answer is i eliminate the trade if double arrow(adx) come lately .. like after 2mint ,3rd mint.. second answer is i take some times that kind trades but check the time remain in mt4 candle .. example let says u receive entry in 2mint in the 5 mint bar so i take two mint expire binary in that time .. i do this for usdcad pair often

--- 帖子 #55 ---
try with other broker ..

--- 帖子 #56 ---
lol ..mate read again wat i typed .. i did not quote ur comment.. i was quote other member

--- 帖子 #57 ---
now working entry in mt4 pair is usdcad

Ok thank you, it was to be clear

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Which is better 1 minute or 5 minutes expiry time?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
US FANTASY......interesting thread, thanks.....however, having NEVER traded binary options, in your experience, what is the advantage to trade this as compared to forex market? Also, is it "sensitive" to market sessions...ie London, US, Asia?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Pleaseeeeeeeee guys we are diverting from the topic of the thread, can anyone help ust o put an alert whe this indicator pops up. Pleassseeeee

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I agree wtith what you said Francisakz guys we should focus on how to make the topic of the thread, achievable can anyone help ust o put an alert whe this indicators pops up

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hello usfantasy, marketsworld don't have mt4 platform, how come you use mt4 to get accurate signals?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
why u jump last page .. things are told in page number 1.. as well as thread title also 5 mint Binary option

--- 帖子 #77 ---
1.if ur trade moved one pip , u receive 7 - 8.5 pip value profit .. 2.u have fixed risk ... that is 10 pips value.. 3.no stop loss hunting after u enter the trade ... 4.no spread ,no commission,no slippage 5.if u forgot to check calender news then no problem ....because no matter if pair run 100 pips against to u..our risk is fixed.. 6.limited trading errors ... 7.we have not leverage so we have not margin call... use any market..no problem at all...but if u trading asia session try with usdjpy,audusd,nzdusd like that pairs ....

--- 帖子 #78 ---
according to my knowledge option brokers not provide mt4....so use forex broker mt4..

waiting patiently and Iam prepared :nerd:

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Bring it on baby

--- 帖子 #86 ---
So which broker mt4 charting platform are you using to look for signals before placing your trade?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
That actually doesn't matter! Make sure you download a MT4 from a reliable broker like FXCM , IC Markets , Pepperstone , just to name a few... You just need a trustworthy price feed

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thank you, yes I know about 5 minutes, I have read your first page 1 but you showed us your record trading lists, time range 2 to 5 minutes (expire time) that is why I want to make sure to check with you ;-)

SMA CrossOver with Alert...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks jdpnz. God bless you for me. Cant wait to try it out

--- 帖子 #91 ---
The attached indicator do an alert exactly according to my best understanding of the strategy. When it says put or call, do it immediately - using the expiry time as indicated on the alert box. The indicator also keeps a running count of the success rate and, running a backtest on the eurusd from 1st Jan till today, the following: Number of trades: 2702 Number of wins: 1365 Win Percentage: 50.52% This is a problem because, using IQOptions (as someone suggested earlier) which, at this moment gives a 71% return on investment I need at least a 56% success rate just to break even. Since the option broker typically will open the trade in a way most favourable to them, I usually will add at least another 5% on the backtest. In other words - on a backtest for trading this strategy with IQOption, I need a minimum of 61% successful trades. These low percentages (I think) can be caused by one of three possible situations namely: 1.) Since the author is trading manually, it is not possible to trade 24hours a day. So firstly, I'd like to know what time of the day we should trade this? 2.) In backtest, the Metatrader platform does not provide proper data within the candle. It is possible that my bad result is caused by the backtest system - although I actually doubt this is the case. To proof this, I will run this indicator forward and live till I have at least 100 trades and then compare the percentages. 3.) The indicators may be weak and the author simply had a lucky run over the past month or 2. During my backtest, by the end of January, the win percentage was down at 48% so, since then the system must have been running around 54-55% maybe. In this case the system may need further development.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
guys i think need small time to tune indicator with developer .. pls be patient ..im sorry if ur hope brakes in this morning ...

hey mate ! dnt call me as Sir.. im not ur Boss!! call me as "us fantasy or mate"

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks dude

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi, This is a clock indicator. It will show remaining time that is left for the candle close. Hope it is useful in this strategy.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Cheers mate for your nice explanation plus backtest!What about using only the signals during london session from 0800 ~ 1700 gmt ??I think this will increase the winning rate rapidly.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks for the feedback and ideas. Thanks us fantasy for calling me your mate. Perhaps some more feedback of my own as well. I have now done 20 trades (on IQOption) and the results are truly interesting. While the indicator continue to hover around 50% success, on the actual trades I have lost 5, with 15 winners (75% success rate!!) This is astonishing (for any option strategy) - thanks to us fantasy. As far as I can see, this difference is due to the following: 1.) Because I have to open the trades manually, there still is an inevitable delay (perhaps 15-20 seconds.) Since the indicators seem to trigger in fast moving markets, there usually is some sort of retrace lasting 15-30 seconds and maybe I am just lucky enough to enter during this period. I also did a test on Binary.com on which I have live accounts and a huge automated trading system so, here my enter delay is maybe a second or less. My percentages on Binary.com correspond with the MT4 indicator (as such, do not make a profit.) 2.) For whatever reason my broker (Instaforex) close the candle exactly 45 seconds after IQOption? This I do not understand but, it is the truth. As such, the actual closing price is different as well. Tomorrow, I plan to continue testing but for me it is past midnight so, I'll call it a day. Once we have 100 trades, we can discuss different session times etc. - or, say thanks to us fantasy and go make some profits so, please do add your experiences.

hi guys im going to give u indicator as promised last Saturday ... this is really advanced indicator .. u will love her because she will speak with u .. she can assist to ur trading .. she keep her eye on the market and tell u it in the lovely way .. .. deal with her properly else ur head will burn LOL ... she is still in teen age .after few rounds we can get mature girl .. indicator created by kiads who have gud intelligence in forex markets/coding indicators ..unfortunately he cant reply to this thread ...he will read ur ideas ..i believe he will stay here continuously to give better girl to us .. thank u very much kiads .. no word to tell about ur civility ... ok mates here is she .. place files correctly ... thanks to u all ..

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I did EA by us_fantasy rules. I got ~ 50 % winning percentage. And by the results there is no difference if you trading only London session or all sessions. The algorithm is : get signal, write current price, wait 5 minutes and write current price, then if signal is buy, price after 5 minutes must be bigger than before, if sell- price after 5 minutes must be smaller than before. There are some errors of mql4 data, so it could be +-5% precision, so there is no big difference. Results from past 15 months on M5 TF: Orders total: 30831, Winners: 14927, Loosers: 15904, win %: 48 -- Trading on all sessions. Orders total: 12930, Winners: 6439, Loosers: 6491, win %: 49--Trading only London session.

hi friends here is few trades i took within 1 and half hour.. pls dnt trade live until u get gud practice .. im not continue to show proofs in my trading ... hope u have same results ..

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I've noticed that your expiry times ranges from 2-4 minutes. Is there a particular expiry that performs the best? Perhaps someone with a backtester could check please?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hey us_fantasy, whats the real trading signal with the new indicator? Only the double arrows?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Seems that, after the signal, we often have a retrace - on the tick chart. This is an opportunity to enter and, because the signal comes with the trend, we often end with a profit. On the other hand - if there is a stall after the signal and we enter, we are likely to end with a loss. See below images for a clear picture

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Another example of the market running out of steam.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
mate keep practice.. u going better .. i think manual trading is better than fully automated system .. always try to use same market time provide option broker and mt4 broker.. my live acc running marketsworlds and my mt4 is xm (live acc) .. currently no problem .. try with this broker or other ecn broker like ic markts,otafx, fxcm .... hope this broker will help to increase ur results .... as i told earlier we can use any trading session ... no problem of trading session .. each session have particular pairs ..in Asia session try nzdusd,nzdaud,usdjpy,audjpy,eurnzd after read ur comments i felt u have expedience in BO ... u know there are plenty of signals provides...they charge huge amount for BO signals .. and they gave very limited service to us .. they also have success near 70%...but we have it already so try to practice this ..then u can start signal company if total goes 80 trades then u can loss 30 trades ... need only 50 win trades .. (70% payout broker) if broker paid higher than that then u can loss more .. so hope u will find the edge to trade profitability to using this concept ..

--- 帖子 #111 ---
ok i will take 5 mint expire option to explain it.. hope u will understand .. according to my Option broker 5 mit option is different.. let says i took the trade 05.45: 25 pm then according to my broker his 5 mint expire in 05.49.pm... so u think i took 4 mint expire option .. it is not my problem it is happen due to broker another example ..if i took trade 05.45:56pm as 2 mint expire then it will expire 05.47pm ..but acctually there is 1 mint and 4 sec ..isn't it? we can't change brokers ..we need adaptation and tune our systems adaptation to their platform ..

--- 帖子 #112 ---
there is few ways to trade using that indicator . . invest small time with ur mt4 .. u will see the light.. she will obey to u soon ...

--- 帖子 #113 ---
if i took trade 05.45:56pm as 2 mint expire then it will expire 05.47pm Hey mate.sorry to asking about that i quote.i really don't understand option. but don't you trading in forex right?so,how could be there is a limit for your open position?do you mean,in your mt4 if you play in 5 minute tf.so your open position will close automatically in 5 minute?.which way is you will take any profit from that single candle(justin crossover +big candle).thank you.

--- 帖子 #114 ---

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Still struggling... Mine's like this... is it all right? Am I doing something wrong? Thanks

--- 帖子 #126 ---
hi i tried it for a hour or so, so far at a loss tho dosn`t mean i lost hope yet another question i notice the second arrow always show up late can be as long as 10 to 20 seconds after the candle opens , is it meant to do that and i trade at that moment i see it show up or is it my internet speed with a late singal ( i supposedly have high speed and my processer is a i5) i think i`m entering a bit late causing me to lose on some of these trades kevo

--- 帖子 #127 ---
If the signal is given once the candle has already opened (10-15 SECONDS after) then you are jumping the gun. I believe you have to wait for the candle to close with the arrow.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
if we need to win the trading , we need to know two things ....it is not only relevant BO..if u understand these two things u will know the trade .. 1.trend direction 2.direction power we need a trend ,it can buy or sell trend direction ..market always have trend ...that is y people saying trend is ur friend ...u can use some trend showing indis ... there are plenty of indicators here in forex factory .. second thing is direction power ..that is really important ..if we have trend direction(up or down ) without direction power then u will mostly lost.. because no power means no continue trend ..i was learn many thing regarding direction power in alien trading thread...adx indicator is gud for measure direction power ..that is y i also used adx values here... alien, nihilist are the genius regarding ADX indicators ... hope u learn some thing.. thanks

no it is normal .. because adx some time give little late ... but check ur mt4 ..try with other broker too... like octafx,roboforex,gomakrts, xm ..and once u feel u are late take breath and give room to came back price again ur side ...it is happen mostly .. then enter adjusting remaining time.. that is my another trick ..mostly 2 mint trades open like that..invest little time to investigate the trading system .. u will c plenty of entries .. so dnt rush ....if any signals pass dnt chase it and wait for next signal.. arrange near 4 pairs in ur mt4 screen ...use gud option broker ...

Hi Thanks for a good indicator (5Min_Binary_Strategy), demoing at present with good results. Do you know of a 15Min_Binary_Strategy indicator based on the 5Min indicator above? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi us fantasy, What pairs are you monitoring and which pairs during which session. Also, a picture of using the latest indicator for trades would be appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi, This morning I can report that I now have done a 102 trades using us fantasy's strategy. I achieved a 69% success rate and since I only need little over 63% to make this worthwhile, I have a cool 6% nett profit on turnover. Thank you us fantasy for a truly simple yet still amazingly profitable strategy.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
What strategy did you use that generate such a good return?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Basically I only trade eurusd - and only after session open. As for strategy I simply use that in I wrote earlier (5_Min_Binary_Strategy) I did 50 trades on demo with IQOption and 52 (small) trades live on Binay.com and they both returned around the same percentages. Next week I'll try trade a bit for real profits on this strategy.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
On another note, a word of caution.. About 2 years ago, I developed a strategy to trade 5min on Binary.com. This gave me 240 trades in 24 hours and the return was around 400%/week. (Every 5 minutes, 20 hours of the day - because Binary.com was closed for trading the other 4 hours.) Worked very well BUT after 18 days the return dropped to breakeven and, I eventually stopped with only 100% profit for all my work. In the final analysis, it became clear that the strategy worked well throughout (the percentages did not vary) - however, the payout (odds) from Binary.com shifted with less and less profit per trade till it was impossible for the strategy to survive. We are depended on a reasonable payout from the broker - with binary trades you are basically betting against the broker and they will do everything possible to defend their position. As such I am still not convinced that we traders can actually make long term profits consistantly from Binaries.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Very true

--- 帖子 #139 ---
That is why it is important to learn both Binary and forex together. Nice work both of you, especially us fantacy, I am havin 80 % success rate

--- 帖子 #140 ---
currently im using limited pairs offer broker.. so im using ,eurusd,gbpusd,audusd,audnzd,usdcad .... i have no trading session.. u can use any trading time..

--- 帖子 #141 ---
nice to heard that.. i dnt know which way u trading ..hope u doing automated system.. but if not doing fully automated this trading system, then u will have more than this ratio... any how nice result mate... i was read many signal providers reviews ...they also having near 70%.. they charging 100$ for two weeks,and give limited time to see there screens .. so i believe this system will help to u all ..

--- 帖子 #142 ---
nice result mate....

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi us fantasy, Please post a picture about using the latest indicator like the ones using the first indicators for both buy and sell. Please help. Bit confused with the new one. Thanks

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Us_Fantasy, I would like to ask you kindly that if you can open your Market World demo account and download Jing program (record and share video) Can you record MT4 with Binary Options (MarketsWorld) to show us how you trade it. I would like to see how you work with it. I am still struggle with it. Your time with it will be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
here is my chart.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) here is kiads indi charts Attached Image (click to enlarge) again and again i want say WE STILL DID NOT CHANGE TRADING RULES ...

--- 帖子 #146 ---
no ..sorry .. i cant show my real acc to others... i shared screen shot using my real trading acc... im sorry.. and ur request feel me like paid member requesting from the service provider ...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Sorry I don't mean that you share with us with your real account when you trade it. I mean I would like to see your example of your trade on Demo account?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
if u guys use this setting with mth indicator, then u will get same result template(initial template ) which i post page number

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Since with BO trading you are essentially trading AGAINST the broker.. (as distinct from trading against the market) ie the Broker is the sole counterparty? then if you as a client devise a highly successful strategy that makes you profitable on that brokers contracts, it is surely SERIOUSLY AGAINST you interest to share it? When by doing so reduces the brokers profit on the contract they are offereing, by increasing the % of their clients that are winning? BO brokers pitch their payout on against their "Book". Like bookmakers? They have no way that I know of "laying off" that risk.. (though I do believe that HFT does offer possibilities). So to be profitable they depend on the majority of their clients getting it wrong.???? And thanks to your sharing, that % significantly increases???? Doh!?? So what do you expect the broker to do when an increasing number of their clients, (thanks to executing a clever strategy theyve learned on FF) other than to protect their business model and margin by reducing their payout (ie changing the Odds?) Remember BO brokers have fewer ways to increase hidden transaction costs than do spot brokers. The kindness and helpfulness good people like us_fantasy are showing here on FF by sharing BO strategies that are broker specific, puts them in the role of a guy sitting on a tree branch and and sawing off that branch at the trunk?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
thanks ur comment mate .. some ur ideas did not realize to me sorry for that.. and i feeling this thread have no luck to go long journey .. ...it is no problem.. if people want they will continue .. need to thanks people who helped to provide coding indicators .. specially thanks goes to jdpnz &amp; kiads .. have a nice day!!!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hello, you enter into a position to explain the strategy "kiads" ?? Thank U

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hello everybody, not a bad day, hope others do good too at the moment 126$ + today

--- 帖子 #153 ---
SkullCandy... Good result on 70% PB. In course of day you risked just over $500.. on an equity of over $2.3K. Your yield to risk ratio was over 20%. And cumulative VaR to Equity ratio on the day was circa 20%. Unless Ive missed something from your screen shot All Good. Nice. .

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I practice in Demo and it very bad, loss much. See the picture. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am still practice with is us_fantasy strategy and I hope to find a solution.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hello us_fantasy, I really don't understand with kiads indicator charts strategy, please can you explain me what is purple circle on top of the bar and green circle under of the bar, when will I ready to trade?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi SkullCandy, My quick calculations say that you're over 200 bucks at the time of the screenshot, by substracting investment from return. Is this correct? Another thing I see is that from the few screens you've shared, you have no negative trades, meaning your win ratio is 100% (considering breakevens are positive of course). Can you talk about your method as well? You use indicators? I personally try to stay out of indicators, and read the charts. Thanks

--- 帖子 #157 ---
unfortunately, your results are real. Jdpnz's backtesting indicator (big thank for that) is actually working very vell on my platoform - in comparison with the forward testing and claimend 50% win/loss ratio in long term is true. Skullcandy and USfantasy must use some own discretion for picking up trades, which goes beyond rules of this strategy. In BO trades, those you consider as BE are actualy loses (0 means no payout = your investment is lost)

--- 帖子 #158 ---
If somebody need it...in ZuluTrade.com you can get all the B.O. demo accounts that you want for free and without broker emails and calls!!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thanks you so much for this. Is it possible to add an e mail alert as well. All the very best to everyone!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Somebody please post a templaite, i have so much indicators in folder that mt4 can't show all of them and that's why i'm asking for a tmp. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Trading is a risk,you know What im doing ,is from 2k in my account, making ( second month started last week) 50%, then withdrawal. Risk ratio is big,right, but i usualy place order for 2 mins or 5 mins, if volumes ar good, or bad, placing short ones to cover up loses, and to stay on small profit or 70 % profit from my investment. Just testing my scalping strategy,for now it works good for me. When i trade,that day is a plus to my account. Dont know how to explain it,but will try to do it a little bit later.At the momment,my screenshots will speak for me I like the risk wich pays $ , i risk it. Cause like everybody in this forums, im here to make cash $$ lol, will post another results today, and thanks!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi Cfabian, yesterday ended with 146$ profit. I think there is no 100% win ratio, but you can lover your losses by covering up your investment by shorter position. Results are positive,cause usualy if i invest 50 $, on 5 or 2 minutes, and if im wrong ,puting another short, and get tiny profit or 2 profits (70% from investment at the same time) Or, from investment in 50 $,losing only 12$, but im trying always to cover up or if i trade that day, stay in the profit! At the momment,testing US strategy,trading almost the same as i do,so thats seems easy for me. Indicators... Trying to get rid of them ,lol,cause had alot of them,and got nothing ..."TRASH",moved them to recycle bin lol. But,only 1, Im using only MA, (MOVING AVERAGE) with 3 diferent periods and MA is exponential. And ofcourse,reading the charts,following the trend and checking Volumes, prefer to trade when market is "alive"..

--- 帖子 #163 ---
If i will trade today, ill try to capture it

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Guys u'r unpolite.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
hullo there US Fantasy. Can u please share with us a little background on this system that u have created? How does it calculate and predict the movement of the trading assets? What attribute to the high win rate? thank you very much for your selfless sharing !

--- 帖子 #166 ---
This system is really interesting. It could easily give a profit of 70 % but during correct hours. You tested it and saw a resukt in the long run about 50.5%. But it is ADX indy and it gives you a lot of false signals in the flat. I'm not a programmer, but I would suggest you to write a code and test it during specific hours - for example from 09:00 to 19:00. And from different options you can see what time is better to trade.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi us fantasy, Iam new to this how do I load the indicator on the mt4 thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
What is difference between both systems? What are the call/put rules in the second ?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thank you very much. I am waiting to hear from you.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi us fantasy Thanks for sharing system. All i can see is Blank alert and can't see from which chart it's coming from. Its compiled code(ex4 file) 1) so Is there anyway developer can fix it please? 2) Second Alert for confirmed move please

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I have the same problem but with the sound alerts should be enough

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi Us_Fantasy, thanks for share. I already install indicator i my MT4. Could you please confirm that the circles in the attch are the right entry positons? thanks

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Bog, im offside at the momment,got plenty of work (on my main one) so no time for trading, but ill be back soon. I think ill capture some vid,where i do enter.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
some of them. If im correct, but you always need to follow the trend,feel the market,after big drop,there is always a retracement, you need to see perfect picture where market moves,to make your moves.. but some of those circles are good place for short positions-trades. Me myself, i always put 1-2 or 5 min trades, if market got Heat.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
had same problem, try oandas mt4, should fix the problem,cause i got none

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Im not us fantasy, but ill try to explain download indicator, then go to instalation folder, mq4l , find libraries and indicator folders. Put indicator there, then open your mt4,and load up indicator ( press navigator-indicators-and find those )

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi Skullcandy, what are the 3 MA periods that you use? thanks!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hey us fantasy, thanks for SMA CrossOver_ Justin. I am not a big fan of crossovers in the binaries, but this one is not bad I can see many traders are interested in your thread, so, if I may, here is a suggestion for those who are not that agressive in trading the bins. One minute chart: Put on sma crossover justin, settings: true; 2; 100; 8 (that way you get way less arrows) No other arrow maker (getting overload, especially brains) Stochastic K 10, D 3, S 3, close/close, exponential, 80/20 levels just for checking Always in trading watch out for the 25 pip-levels (Gird) market loves those levels. For example: GBY/JPY: 175.000, 175.250, 175.500, 175.750, 176.00 If an arrow appears at or around those levels AND Stoch is over 90 or below 10.... pretty good signals because of overbought and oversold situations. Next: Always look at Fibonacci Numbers for Expiry: For example 5 candles, 8 candles, 13 candles, 21 candles in the M1. That way market has a bit more time to move that way and the difference between mt4 datafeed and bin op broker datafeed does not kill your trades that often (especially for the 60 sec-junkies) And do yourself a huge favour: DO NOT put on more than two pairs and think an alarm will make you rich. You have to observe a pair, drawing lines all the time and let the pair tell you where it is and what it will do next, it starts talking to you. Regards wolf300

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Bt, those 3 periods are "26" "14" and "6"

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi us, can you please let me know if you have any alert for your indicator ? Should be helpful. Thanks in advance. Regards

--- 帖子 #181 ---
My dear friends! One question. I read all the thread and might have missed smth., but after we have yellow arrow on previous candle how long we should wait for both ADX arrows to open a position? Should we enter if they appear immediately at the opening of new candle or we can open position (60 sec) is they even appear at the, let's say, 50-th second of current candle?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I would like to know opinions about the same question. If the candle closes with yellow and the next opens with full blue or red, it's obvious that we should go to 5 min. But what happen if the yellow or the full blue or red appears once the current candle has started?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thanks i will try oandas mt4 then

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hello there, Do you guys have an indicator or EA that helps backtest a strategy for binary options? What I mean is an indicator which will give stats on the system I have. Thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Guys very new to the forum but not so new to binary... So i found your thread and read all your posts. I still have not even loaded my charts yet but seeing al your screenshots i see something- a pattern. Ok so look for this. Look for the yellow arrow to be in a opposite colored candle. For example a yellow arrow saying call the candle with the call arrow has to be red.Vice versa. Examples(Starting of the ss is the place where the yellow arrow is) (These were all taken from the screenshots u guys posted) 1. http://gyazo.com/28fbc365e948731b4e6136e4609a6cf8 2. http://gyazo.com/7a8744061c8849493436a334ae905db7 3. http://gyazo.com/b846d914b2cd2e8a1c0216499797f8dc 4. http://gyazo.com/7ad983450aaf1ffefc7e52abb3ff91bb The following ss are from this guy who posted in the thread saying he had bad results. The screenshots are from the screenshot he posted( http://gyazo.com/5c9e30f4c30f1e44620c33af1aa264ae ) 1. http://gyazo.com/b808a78a08dc5a5382b9316456886e93 2. http://gyazo.com/a89436f8fbd535be908e5c3d2b22aaac 3. http://gyazo.com/c5e1d9f4561e8c8297c5333a5943b7b8 4. http://gyazo.com/d5ebba0096314a421e97263df5ed0667 Hope u guys can understand what i am saying if u dont just say and il try to explain again. The trades are much more rarer and harder to find but they yield a higher %

Hey us fantasy! Thanks for sharing your system/strategy and time. With regards to the "SMA CrossOver Justin.ex4". I've watched it on the M1 time frame and noticed that it repaints. I don't think this should be the case since it's a SMA. With that being said, could I have done something wrong on my end or is there a particular reason for this? Thanks! Numero

Hello IIUkc and Jdpnz, do you use this for robot programmer to catch big red with small pink arrow together or big blue with small green arrow together after closed of yellow arrow? Did you try it? My computer connection to the Internet is a bit slow, when I click on my mouse to order but it delays 3 to 5 seconds, it bad and it causes late and bad result.

Thanks us_fantasy. My question is simple: you go with all the trades that match the condition (yellow arrow + blue / red arrow). Or do you use aditional information like trend strength, RSI or sto, fibo... ?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yes guys good new demo trade Binary to your hearts content .. open Zulu trade account you can choose forex or binary or both .. do not worry about 30 day trail it just keeps running ...

--- 帖子 #225 ---
PS the trick to Zulutrade .. most of the information regarding traders .. is how the followers got results .. people intervien which you should do sometimes ...I found 1 trader to follow I recommend Sofiafx ... the states are misleading she is doing +10% per month ... but she did not close the trades at NFP ... I let it ride to see what she would do .. she let it ride ..it was down 4 days she held and it came good.. she a good trader .. but if I closed the trade she be +25% .. the trick to finding a good trader I only just noticed the other day .. ignore all stats .. click the chart .. it looks simple but if you click it WOW .. a full detailed year chart pops up ... get any trader with almost straight line rising left to right over a year .. good trader .... try demo on both forex and binary ... have fun .. I hope this is a break through .. it was for me ...

I have also downloaded the indi but i am not getting any arrows just alerts all call on every pair can anyone help please

This sounds like a decent system, any other recommendations?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
This is what i am getting no arrows at all and when i get a alert it is always a call

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Dear Us fantasy, I know how your broker MW works, but from few of your prscrs I can see thay you enter a trade even on 3-rd o 4-th minute of candle. Is that correct to do or it's better to enter a trade only during first minute of a candle?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Some subscribers new to BO may not realize that not all brokers offer similar BO contracts. For example most (I understand) 5M broker contracts have a specified expiry time, but some allow clients to enter this contract up to 2 or 3 minutes prior to expiry. (for example a 5M contract with specified expiry at 1:05:00 may be bought up to 1:01:59) However in contrast, at least one major Fx Bank offer 5M contracts that expire exactly 5 minutes after entry , whatever entry time may be . and not at a specific time.(eg 1:05:00) With this sort of contract for example, if I enter a 5M PUT at 1:00:33, my contracts expires at 1:05:33. The above are just rough examples to illustrate the sort of differences that exist between brokers and their contracts. and may limit and complicate the useful application of this strategy, in specific cases. I believe it would be important for anyone applying us fantasy s work here to ensure that you are working with a same broker or one with a similar if not identical contract to his.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yeah, I know that, but what I'm asking is whether it's correct to open trades for example at 18:39? It is the 4-th minute of candle. I'm not asking about "MW" rules of setting expiration time. Ther're examples of US Fantasy's trades in the previous page. I thought you need to open a trade in first 2 minutes of 5 minute candle after yellow arrow on the previous one. That's why I'm confused.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
im sorry ...after u said i checked files using fresh mt4.. i was also downloaded file from this thread.. i think u have broker issue.. there is no problem in my attachment area ..

[quote=us fantasy;8228216]{quote} mate i think u forgot one thing.. that is signal period .. i think it can eliminate bad signals ..im not coder so dnt know much to explain this situation ...sorry.. Good day Us Fantasy, I have read your thread and all of your post twice, nice system though. I have a question concerning the yellow arrow. when i run it on a simulator to back test, it sometimes appears in the simulated chart without appearing in the real offline chart. my simple question is this " are you really sure that it appears after a candle has closed, please i need you to be sure before answering this question" so i will know. thanks alot and i wish you a green week(in the money week) ahead.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
... Ignored Hi, I'm not Us Fantasy, but gonna answer it - yes you're right. Sometimes yellow candle DOES appear on a previous candle.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
... Ignored it is come after candle close

--- 帖子 #251 ---
i did not have so much luck with this system so far.less than %40 winning rate. regards fred

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi fredgold3434 When did you try? and pairs? I traded yesterday (PM 22~23)(GMT+9) 4 traded and 3 won

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Winning three out of four does not equal winning 75 of one hundred, you can think you won 75% but until you test with more than 100 entries, you cannot know the winning percentage with a few entries. That's why in BO everybody says "I won 3 of 4" and it seems great but when checking and testing the whole strategy, the "piece of pie" gets always lower than the 60%....and that is bad for BO.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi mr ya i know i need more test and now im testing I test over 100 and ill show dont worry

--- 帖子 #255 ---
So why not to try it in FX trading? Why particularly BO? Good results in my demo (HF) but still thinking how to secure trades from sudden slippage..

--- 帖子 #256 ---
2nd day playing with Bi opps ..lovin it Thankx for the intro Bro no stress trading

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi, did anybody of the followers play around with the settings of the arrow indis ? Or maybe add other arrows or filters to get, let`s say, more stable results? I am using the "sma crossover Justin" with the settings 2, 89,5 to get less arrows (tick mode: false). We can put our experiances together, what you think?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I always won in BO when playing in DEMO accounts...the stress in trading comes when the "real thing" is on and you can loss your "real" money.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
when the alert come, i suppose we should check the chart, if it fit the criteria we will go ahead with the recommendation of put/call. not sure if my system is wrong, havent't been getting good result. , what will be the best time to trade for each pair, or which pair are you guys mainly focusing ? us_fantasy and yuki0912

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I'm using MTH MA CROSS but the arrows repaint or slow to load to get work in M1 expiring in M5. Has some setting for arrows appear before?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
While agreeing with the sentiment of your post. Would you not benefit from making that transition slowly? A number of brokers offer extremely small minimum stakes Two that spring to mind are Dukascopy and IQOptions. Spend a week or two using $1 stakes. Then progress SLOWLY to more normal sizes. As you become used to the reality of live trading. Hope this helps.. PS I use one of the above mentioned brokers.. and every day my first trades are ALWAYS for a minimal sum.. to check the platform/latency etc. Never rush. ONLY take V. high probability trades. and continuously monitor for changes in market patterning.. When to trade.. when NOT TO. IMHE the "when not to.." will dictate your success. The market will be there tomorrow.. Just make sure you are. LoL

--- 帖子 #262 ---
You're right. I think I'd be fine with your proposal rithem....which one of those brokers are better?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Very different contracts. There is no "better". There is only worse. 3 things important. 1. Safety of your equity/regulation - Dukascopy +++ / IMHO IQOptions Cypriot registration isnt worth a toss. 2. Dependibility of pricefeed - both are reputable and indepenently verifiable 3. Dependibility of execution - variable and continually changing. A 4th important factor is the sustainability of the Brokers business model.Remember your ONLY counterparty in a STF option is the Broker. When IqOption started they offered 93% return on E$ 60 sec options. That was NOT sustainable.They have now reduced that to 85%.. which ironically has increased my confidence in them. You want a broker thay makes money. Just NOT your money. Dukas offers a 90% return on same instrument. HOWEVER the contract offered between Dukas and IQOption are VERY different.And the Dukas contract much more difficult . Im not going to describe.. both have demos.. sign up and see for yourself. Finally there is the question of DEMO v REAL. Make NO mistake there WILL be differences in execution. And NONE will be to your benefit. By choice, I recommend using very fast machine, with HSI, and digital timestamped screen recording and other latency monitoring software for anyone trading above average stakes. Just some thoughts.. Hope of help. C

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Really great advice. Thanks a lot. It's to share these posts that I like "posting and rambling" on forums. I was in 240ption and I saw that they paid only 70% in 60 seconds. Then the accuracy of my strategies has to be at least 75 % to be really profitable... I think I'll try one of you recommended. Then you will win part of my money also hahahahaha or I'll win yours! P.S. I realized that to have a very fast machine is also needed, you can't rely on luck in this biz. We need all the arsenal ready to go. Savvy words. See you in FF.

many times are overdue signal.. and i was install kiads pack and it's look good too

here my result on grandbroker with mt4 application. i using kiads pack and it usefull

--- 帖子 #267 ---
It seems great! congratulation.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
This advice is awesome in my opinion. One question I would ask - while CySec regulation may not give traders huge confidence (!), if UK regulation was handed over to the financial conduct authority (FCA) ( Binary options brokers to be FCA regulated? ) would that give greater confidence? This is the same organisation that regulates the banking industry, and surely has more teeth (and more desire) to expose in shady operators?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
when do you enter the trade? Immediately when the signal appears? Or do you wait for it to retrace back for you to get in at a better price? Are we entering after the candle closes or as soon as the blue or red arrow appears?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
hello sir fantasy....i just want to know are you set a TP@SL ?? if yes,how??? tq

hello, can't there be an alert on the yellow arrow so we know when it appears?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi us fantasy! Thank you for sharing your hard work, I have 2 question´s : 1st: Is it possibble to get an Audio-Alert if the yellow Arrow "sma corssover_justin" appears? 2nd: Is it possibble to get an Audio- Alert just" if the "yellow DownArrow appears with a bullish Candle" and also for an UpArrow with a bearish Candle I dont know anything about encoding and Msql, so you would do a big favour for me... Thanks in advance and friendly greets from Austria Rene

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi flairrene. You should try to use "kiads pack" (on first page, at the top, you can download it). Kiads pack already includes all sound stuff that you have mentioned

Could someone help me how do I use the files given by us fantasy ? I have downloaded kiads pack and 5mint binary rar files. Where do I install them ? I use 24options trading platform and trade via a browser. Can I use these indicators with 24option platform at all ? If no, what platform do I use and how do I install these files on that platform. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
finally got it installed and working.. But the arrows are not very clear. May be because of my terminal.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Us fantasy I have been using your template and indicators and it is working most of the time. But sometimes, I first get the blue+green arrow and after about 1 or 2 minutes, I get the yellow indicator and the alarm. Should I just ignore such signals ? See the attached pic (of-course you will not be able to make out which arrow came first from the pic, just for reference). Another thing I noticed was, when the yellow indicator and blue+green indicator come in the correct sequence, there is slightly a delay about 1 or 2 min between yellow and blue+green indicators. In this case instead of trading with 5 min timer, can I trade with 2 min expire ? I am a beginner, so excuse if you find my questions silly. Thank you

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi US Fantasy, I am not getting the Yellow Arrow which appears first, before the Blue and Red ones. I am using MT4 and I am trying in a Demo Account. Can you please help? Thanks

Check whether all the indicators are attached to the chart. Right click on the chart and then Indicators (or Ctrl + I). It should look something like this.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
@ georgebinary Also ensure that you have selected 5Min candle period.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hello Kumbha, thank you for taking time to help me out. In your list of indicators, there are two Average Directional Movement Indexes. But in mine, there is only one with 14 period. I can insert another one but I don't know what period it should be. I wanted to paste a screen shot. But for some reason the Ctrl+v is not doing it. So I pasted the screen shot on a word document and attached it here. Please take a look. It is not looking quite the same. Can you kindly let me know what is missing. I really appreciate your help. Thank you and Regards, George

--- 帖子 #295 ---
You are good to go. Those two Average Directional indicators(optional) are automatically added by MT4 I guess. You have included all the indicators given by us fantacy. You should now get alarm messages suggesting to CALL / PUT (when appropriate arrows are displayed on the chart). As mentioned by us fantacy, do not use these to trade 30 min before and 30 min after the news hours.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hello everyone.... Does it work only on 5 min charts or we can adapt it on 15 min charts ? Does the settings change ? Thanks for your answers

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Kumbha, Thank you for your help. Although I have all the indicators, I am not getting the arrows as shown in US fantasy's original screen shots and instructions. Anything you can think of? Thank you, George

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi, I have a quick question. When trading 5 min binary option the current candle is counting down. I I want to place a call or put exactly when the next candle starts, how many many seconds before the end of the current candle, should I press the enter button? Like 4.57, 4.58, 4.59 or 5.00. I am thinking that between you press the button and the broker executes the order there might be a few seconds of time delay. Thank you in advance, George

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thanks US fantasy , to share your strategy i have tested it , i think its better that you follow or put trade according to only yellow color arrow direction because if yellow arrow show upward direction or buying signal then put the buying trade and on downward direction sell trade. i sure , through in this way you can get best pips result in M5 time frame .

Hi Guys Just read all the pages of this thread. Very interested in trying the idea by US_Fantasy bro. Can assist on the following please: a) Which broker are you guys using successfully b) Which broker currently provide expiry on the closure of the bar c) Any MT4 broker giving expiry on the closure of the bar? For MT4, I am trying NoaFX and also Marketsworld but both don't have exact closing bar expiry. Marketsworlds the current bar expiry comes a bit late. For example if the signal appears 9.01, they don't have 9.05. They only have 9.04 or 9.08. But it appears later for 9.05 Any assistance would be appreciated...thanks

Hi US_F good to see your still about .. Hope all well. I dont use this system but IMHO its a good basis for BO traders to work with. Good Job! Im dropping in here however to disagree with you (Ooops!) in your post above..LoL We all know that the right choice of broker in BOs is absolutely vital. Truth is there are VERY FEW properly regulated, with reliably linked interbank price feeds, and proper support. IMHO.. If youve got a secure broker, DONT change another broker with less integrity simply because they offer direct options trading on MT4/5. The answer is to do your signals and analysis with a demo spot MT4/5 from same or another a reliable ENC broker but on a SECOND screen. PC/Laptops almost all support a second VGA display with extended screen support. Set up correctly your mouse will seamlessly pan from one screen to the second.. no probs ..no delays. I trade Dukas BOs. Dukas dont support MT4/5, but I use a 3rd party software MT4 interface on the Dukas price feed that works. ​That way I can do all my analysis and signal development in an MT4 environment on the SAME actual pricefeed Im trading on. Hope this of help.

Mariodrugs: first u need to wait come yellow arrow. that yellow arrow came after candle closed .. after that same time u should receive both big arrow and tiny arrow together. Correct: Situation 2 Now my indicators are shown everything, problem was reason to have file in subdirectory. Good luck traders!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I confess I dont use this system and havent looked in detail at the indi signal code. However.. NORMALLY IMHE indis displaying arrow signals paint their arrows on the close of the bar price under which which the arrow is printed? So the green arrow in your example above will only appear/be confirmed on the close of the bar under which it appears. Which means the earliest a trade may be executed on that signal is the open of the following bar. Which makes it impossible to enter at "situation 2" level? Since the arrow doesn't appear until close of that bar? Now sure.. I may have missed something.. bcs Ive not had time to examined the code.. BUT.. If my summary observation is correct.. ? (if not I apologize in advance) It highlights an ubiquitous problem with the coding of almost ALL "signal" indis. The proper standard for all "signal indis" is the printing of an on-chart "PRICE LABEL" at the instant at which the signal is triggered. For most Indis for the signal to be properly actionable this should NOT REPAINT. (there are exceptions where repainting signals may be useful. and used to advantage under caution but not normally) have I missed something?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Do Yellow arrows repaint? I've noticed something if this holds true to at least the yellow arrow. Also do the following arrows after yellow arrow repaint ?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
To add to my reply. I 've also noticed Yellow arrow and big arrow with small arrow appearing on same candle. How do you trade that?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
The arrows doesn't repaint and when the rules are met it wins 90% the problem is the big arrow comes after the opening of the current candle and you need to trade the current candle

--- 帖子 #329 ---
So how does that work? I mean the big arrow is important, and part of the system.? Can you tape some trades on something like Screencast-O-Matic and post?

Hi anyone who can kindly help with the following, I am trying to use "US Fantasy"'s 5 min binary method. In this method, the yellow arrow should appear so that I can get ready. But, the Yellow arrow is only appearing at the close of the candle or the beginning of the next candle. This way the yellow arrow is not giving time to get ready. Is there anyway to make the yellow arrow appear while the candle is forming as opposed to popping up at the close of the candle. Also I am not getting any alerts when the yellow arrow is popping up although I have the sound file in the right folder. I really appreciate anyone's help with this. Thank you and best regards.

Hi Us fantacy thanks again for the threads... , and hi all, i have been using the method for couple of days now and so far so good..., as i am new to this method i enter rarely, taking the best most possible trade of all.. first of all, im just following the rule that is there and working it up again for better result but again its up to you guys to set your comfort. i have been watching this method for weeks now and most important i can say is !! GET YOUR TIMING RIGHT !! i usually go for the safe one like near the open price, be patient and wait for price to go back a bit to that level., and there is a saying in trading !! dont chase a moving train !! here is some example on the trade, enter signal will mostly appear if the price has moved and might loose a trade if you just enter as soon, as the price might weaken, i know that is the method at first to enter as soon, but i rather be safe and wait that the price is near the open of the candle also for reference im my real trade history, some of them is minus, it is what it is trade cant be 100%, and mistake are learned from it. again im posting my rule : what i know : 1. no trade 30 min before news and 30 min after news 2. use timing right (5 min expiry but calculate the timing right, signal is there after 2 min than enter only for 3 min) 3. follow the signal (do not enter if not legit) 4. try to be patient and get open candle price 5. dont chase the moving candle adding to this reply, USD/JPY and XAU/USD got the most weird signal of all so be real careful here anyone that have use this method and can share to make all of us trade better please write something regards.

Hello Guys, I am with FXCM and I need some help with understanding the information in the Account history tab in MT4. As shown in the account history tab, The price I entered the trade (buy GBP-NZD) at 2.16114 and the price I closed (sold) is 2.16329. The difference is 21.5 pips. I traded a standard lot and hence one PIP is worth $10. So the profit must be $215. But, in the account history tab it is showing $147.39 instead of $215. why is the difference? Commission is charged separately as two 7 dollars.$7*2 = $14 I will appreciate if someone can explain the difference. Thank you and Happy New Year 2016 to all. George

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Dear USfantasy, I've attached a picture from and AUDUSD short signal. I'd like to kindly ask, how should I manage the signals when it comes in the middle of the candle? I mean, you we can see the yellow arrow and after that together the red and purple arrow. That's a signal,but it came out on the yellow line. It means I should open a PUT position with 5M expiration even though where it appears? Thank you in advance your help and answer.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Same question mate. Or maybe we enter to close position on the same candle, I mean, if the signals popup after 2 minutes, we put 3 minutes to expiration time. Is that correct? Sorry, English is not my first language...

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I would like to test this on a 1 hour TF, 5mins is too fast paced for me. What do you think US_Fantasy?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Good evening everyone, First of all thank you very much @us_fantasy for your great work. I am quite new to the whole binary trading system. One question I have is that your template always seems to be 10 - 13 pips off the current rate. For example GBPUSD says in MT4 with your template 1.4360 it says at my broker 1.4373. Is there anyway to change that? Furthermore when I get an alarm lets say for GBPUSD put at 1.4350 and my broker says 1.4360 shall I still go for it seeing the template is slightly off? Thank you very much for your help guys!!!

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi Guys, I started this method couple of weeks ago, and today was the first complete trading day with this strategy, And it was great I am trading the London Session with Some Trend Analysis, It is good system thanks, @us fantasy I am hoping to do this in the long term and lets see.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Day 1: 18 Trades 13 Wins 72% Day 2:

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi CBB, I'd like to ask,don't you realized that all signals are repainting? I'm mean I'm looking at 5Min chart, than it's closed, I get the next candle, and after few sec or minutes, I get a signal. Do you enter into a trade, as soon as you get a signal even though when it appears?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
In the picture you can see that I got the signal for "Put". But it did just last for one 5 minute candle. Unfortunately I can only choose between 60sec, 90sec, 120sec, 180sec and 300sec. So when I get the signal and there is only 3 minutes left for this candle do I still "Put" for 300 sec or shall I go for 180 sec seeing the candle is closing after this time.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi, Today Asian Session Trading, Both 5 Min and 1 Min Trades only EURUSD. I am using the 5 min binary option template plus moving averages (5,10,50,100,200) and RSI

--- 帖子 #387 ---
My London Session, Just some small trades

--- 帖子 #388 ---
nice results mate

--- 帖子 #389 ---
thanks a lot for your system it is really good and simple

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Dragonfxsl - What are the rules you use to enter? Too many arrows and colors I still do not understand what the entry is...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Same as what us_fantasy has mentioned mate after the yellow arrow the moment the red and pink combined arrow appears enter the trade. I also use Moving averages as an indicator to where the market is going and overall trend as where to trade. Also I trade 60 sec other than 5 min

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi, Thanks to the explanation, just wanted to know when the Red/Pink arrows appear?! in the time 0 (Current candle) or after candle closed?!

--- 帖子 #393 ---
While 5M candle goes.(current candle)

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi Dragon, I've been eying this thread for a little while now and front tested the system with pretty much break even results. I'm curious to know how you use your additional indicators because I see three failed signals and only one winning signal on your screenshot: Loss: 8:30 long signal Loss: 8:50 long signal Loss: 9:50 long signal Your only winning signal was at 10:00 (short signal). Please explain and thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #395 ---
according to his replies dragon had 25 entries in his screen ... 2 lost and one tie .. 23 winners there...

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Shemski I use moving averages crossover (1 Min and 5 Min) as an additional indicator and also trade 60 sec

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I see potential in this strategy definitely but it would be better to aligned with the trend, so best to trade when price above 50, 100 or 200 ema Call option and the reverse for PUT option, just my suggestion.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
hello us fantasy wich pack .rar i do install in my mt4?? kiads.rar or th first one?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thanks fellows

--- 帖子 #400 ---
hy bro definitely go with the trend i usually go by 1 hr trend to get a more accurate reading and check 200 EMA

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hy Guys this is my results for today, Had a bit of losses Totally My Fault but overall good Use this method plus trade with the trend and use moving averages as guidelines

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Not a bad day, I think it works

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I like your Forex indicator but not working to great so i have played around with it and so far hitting every trade

--- 帖子 #404 ---
That is actually MT4 not the template

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi guys, I'm studing Forex and BO since 2 years and now I'm valuating this strategy. It seems really a good strategy, thanks to us fantasy and other traders for sharing all this hot stuff! Appreciated! Just one question to Lsfx, what broker do you using?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi guys....Good job us.It Seems like a good strategy.I cant say I feel comfortable enough yet to actually use it, but results seem to be almost fine.Also I took a peak into the code and I am sure that the one indicator repaints.I havent seen on live action an actual repaint but the code says it is possible to happen.I will try to find a solution on it and I will get back to you guys.Ricksterlee5 I am very interested on your thoughts about the indicators because I feel something is missing.I have been playing around also, changing the settings and paremeters but no luck yet.Any ideas ricksterlee5?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I am new to this thread. Started demo using the indicators today and looks to be a good start with 2 consecutive wins.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hey I just discovered this post. Is this method still applicable? Thanks! I have downloaded files from the first post of this forum. Are those all I need or is there something else I'm missing out?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
hi yes , system is still running nicely..

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Guy's Thank's for sharing this different near success but anyone tell me this indicator start after 1 or 2 mints in 5 mints candles Please reply anyone

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi! us fantasy can you tell me if there is any time through the day were it is more accurate.Asking because started with this indicator last night and really liked it...i mean won like 8 times in a row and not once lost 2 times in a row but...in last few hours lost a lot and i m thinking if you have any indications when to use and when not to through the day.Guessing that when there are events it should not be used, but if you have any other idications i would like to know.Thank you! P.S: what is your opinion on iq option? i m new to binary option.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I tried this morning and I have nailed 9 consecutive wins between 11:30 to 12:30 GTM After that shamble.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Same here brother...I am thinking that it maybe something with the begging and ending of a market(example: London-new york),not like i know much...but it seems to give bad signals there.If someone who has more experience can tell us when to use it, that would be great.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Thanks so much for this!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
hi first three - four hours in new York market open.. i added indicator for markt times.. start ur trading once red line start and end within 3 or 4 hrs

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thanks for indicator - Also good to trade GBP when London open - I got the attached indicator - Options to show London, NY, Tokyo, Sydney sessions - If the indicator doesn't work on your MT4 - I got it here free - http://forexuseful.com/new/members/2...der-indicator/

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thanks for the advice, something else is that it seems that many times the indicator comes to long after the candle opens,is it something that i need to set or the settings that are already in the indicator are the good ones? thank you for the help!

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi I have been following this post for a while now and would like to try ,showing my ignorance here but how do I install the indicator on Dukascopy or Forex Factory Help would be appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I still think that all those "Turbo" Binary 30sec-5min is simply Gambling, it really is, too much noise in both directions. Why not take 1-2 trades per day and hit 100% instead of 10-15 trades and lose 4-5? It's the same thing in terms of profit. 15min Chart 1-3 hours Expiration should do the job.. IMHO, About the System Chart looks like Christmas tree full of Errors, how anyone can trade that? One candle 2 Errors Red and Green on the same candle? LOL yeah, take a pick..

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Still hoping someone can tell me how to upload indicator ,I have tried with no luck on mt4 however I use Dukascopy or even forex factory ,Thanks

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Which are the results of this system?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Very nice system. Testing on demo for some trades, all WINS so far. One minor problem, I have opened several charts on MT4 with the indicator, I noticed that signals do not automatically come as they should appear in each chart. For example, I let the chart run for 25 mins, 5 candles were completed however no signals on it. Then i reloaded the indicator again on chart and noticed that there were signals on those 5 candles in last 25 mins. I did not get them in real time. Does anyone have this problem?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thanks for the new indicators

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hello Mr fxforecast, thanks indicators. Build 950910765 belong to a folder INDICATORS, or EXPERTS? You must install all three Build? Thanks information zbyma

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hello Me fxforecast, thanks information Zbyma

--- 帖子 #258 ---
i've installed the EA, and some blue lines appeared. My question is how to you use the EA to predict where price might go?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
FxForacast, can you please explain how that EA works? All I see is a Blue Vertical line placed in the future, And what I supposed to do? Buy? or Sell and When? What Indicators do I need? Also look at your payouts in Post 430 What is your Broker? How that's possible that you got more than 100% payout for 1 trade? So? then I can just Sell and Buy at the same time and collect cash 24/7 even though it's 5 Cents still Crazy payouts you get there? What is that? Some fantasy Demo account? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi fxforecast, Good day! I would also like to try Binary trading and came across your EA/indicator. Would you be so kind to help with my questions below? 1. Can you show a more specific way how to use the BinaryTimeTracker? 2. Once a blue line appears, how do we know if its a buy or sell? 3. What should we look for in the ADX? 4. Will the expiry of our trade be at the blue line or should it end at the blue line? Sorry for a lot of questions. Thank you in advance!!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
How can you tell when you have multiple blue line together which ones are entries and which ones are exits?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thank you so much, fxforecast, for the EAs/Indicators and PDF. I am now trying it on my MT4. But how long does it take for a signal to appear and would it have an alert function? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I saw a signal on GBPUSD. I opened a trade now and will exit at 1:55 (Binary.com time, my broker is 1 hr advance). Lets see how it goes

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Not sure if I entered or followed the rules correctly. I now see 2 sell and 1 buy signal with 2 blue lines. How should we trade this setup? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
So much 1st trade was unsuccessful and the graph looks like this now. Would anyone be able to help explain what I did wrong and how i should have traded? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
what broker are you using for binary options?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hello FXForecast,I must say that your EA/Indicator carries a lot of promise and might be ground breaking when it comes expiry prediction.With that said,i would have to register a problem that i encountered a problem after installing your wonderful piece.The blue lines have still not shown up even after 6 hours of loading the 950 build indicators.My request is,can you highlight the problem and then profer it with the most suitable solution?Would be most grateful.Great Job.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Not sure what happened I have the EA loaded correctly and the indicator also absolutely nothing is showing up on my chart? I have it on the GU as you said but not working no lines no nothing? Clearly there is something wrong with your EA probably not getting the DLL imports it needs to work

--- 帖子 #292 ---
The best advice - Go and read this -http://forexuseful.com/new/members/21812-binary-options-review/ The "Trading system" and "Signal service" section are of particular interest...

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Any idea when you will be up and running again. Would like to test this thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
when will the upgrade be done so we can test? thanks and Happy Easter

--- 帖子 #295 ---
We have seen so many crooks as u

--- 帖子 #296 ---
That's an interesting pdf, but can the amount you trade with be increased because the amount you show in the pdf is not enough? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi all, could you indicate if this strategy can run automatically within MT4 Platform or if you need to place orders manually? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
On page #1 of pdf file you are showing Trades which has been taken (open) almost immediately 2nd trade open 6 seconds after 1st is taken And on the Page #2 you are saying, that 2nd trade needs to be taken few seconds before 1st expires.. So? You not sure how to trade? Explain to me HOW on the $10 trade you get 13.14 is that Including your Bet then you lose $10 and make $3.14 back ? Or if not, who is paying 130% in binary. Usual Payout in Binary is in the range of 70-85%.. And What the F* Sale price means? You either ITM or OTM.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Are you speaking of Nadex those are the only kind of options that have this kind of flexibility from my experience. Thanks I think the reason why the other member called you a crook is you are actively trying to sell your system and software here. I think that is sad. Now I do understand that your software carries a certain price and you are allowing a limited version of it as a trail. That part is fine with me. But to advertise a certain strategy that you say gives 93% success rate and basically say I will give it to you for $50 bucks does not have much credibility to me it's what scammers do not saying you are one but the same exact approach

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Thanks for this, whats the difference between Build 950 and 910. Do I need to only download one?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi all New to this forum and new to Binary Options, find this thread to be a very interesting read and testing out this strategy as of now on demo. Just want to ask if I want to set up additional indicators on this strategy to further guide me, what settings/parameters should I be using for RSI, CCI and Stochastics as these are the 3 I want to add? Many thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hello Fx Forecast, congrats on the release of you revised binarytimetracker only for one problem.The indicator does not seem to work on my platform (build 950).What can be done in this regard?Thanks in anticipation.

To US_Fantasy, First off I love the thread and read through it all and get the strategy, how the indicators work and how to execute the trade when the signal is in place, and to be patience and wait for the right strike point so your get the opening or close to the opening of the current candle etc for the 2-3 min remaining expiry, thank you everything. When i go download the indicators its a explore file for me, and i noticed some of the ones that people posted have the MQL4 file diamond cation sign, is there a way you could please post the indicators in a MQL4 file format or pm me that to me, thanks mate! sorry for the grammar errors btw people. lol

--- 帖子 #483 ---

Just want to say thanks for showing me the Win.rar software, it worked! And i was able to get the indicators on my MT4. BUT, am I correct in saying, that the pack has no longer have yellow arrows (replaced my clear red arrows for start of set up DOWN and clear blue arrows for start of set up UP) AND am I correct that there is not longer right arrows, just replaced by (solid red arrows and solid blue arrows) wish i had you old indicators to follow like your first sreen shots, but i understand things change, but am I correct from the above assumptions? BIG THANKS And How are you do with the system strategy now, i hope all is well for you mate!

Dear us fantasy Did you have Kidspack Binary EA Vertion i mean auto trading system

--- 帖子 #494 ---
This is like big Kindergarten: "how the hell does he get such results?" Photoshop, my friend, ever heard about that software? That particular site is Scam, search google you will see.. And by the way, best approach for binary are bounce from Support Resistance, Pivot line, Cause when you buying All those already lag "crosses" even though trend is in your favor this is not Guarantee, that next candle will be in your favor.. Basically answer is higher timeframe 15m expiration is minimum 30 min better, that's only guarantee that you are not gambling but really reading the Trends.. 2-5M there is no trends there, its a market noise, you can trade it sure, but long term output will be closer to 50/50. The GOAL is to Make high probability bets and not striking 20 trades per day out of curiosity.. And that system looks like a Christmas Tree, 2 Errors on each Candle, and Errors on Every Candle How the heck you guys trading this mess? )) Good luck..

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Zigler, people like you drive me NUTS as I'm an experienced, 30 year trader. You are yet another lazy, uneducated person with simple words such as "Scam" and "Photoshop" to make up for being uneducated. Over Memorial Day weekend I purchased their product and they even gave me access to their posted result site and it's COMPLETELY LEGIT results. So, stop with your BS "photoshop" nonsense for being uneducated. Maybe just you can't get such results. Please if you don't know something, don't shoot from the hip. I don't care about this company, but hate when lazy morons just type nonsense as uneducated traders. I'm even their formula on my LIVE forex account and attached is my result just yesterday.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Yeah, Educated, sure experienced trader? Only Retired drunk Plumber with zero brain, will use some miracle robot and indicator promising 90% winning rate in BO, which is doesn't exists.. http://www.binaryoptionsbrain.com/wp...2015/01/bo.png Even according to this statement, they made "just" 200+% over entire year (Deposit: $264 / Profit $500), if they constantly made 8 wins out of 10 as they claim, they would Multiply their account 5-10 times already if adjusting bid size according to account balance..

--- 帖子 #497 ---
kiads did not code it as automated system sorry..

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Zigler, again, uneducated is what you clearly are in this case. You claimed they were "photo shopped" and "Scam" and clearly you were wrong on both. You ARE uneducated. I trade Forex and I simply asked if anyone knew anything about a binary website (which I didn't even specify by name as I don't want to plug them) that claimed to have such great results. Didn't hear from anyone and went and signed up on my own over the holiday weekend. Amazingly surprised how factual and honest they were and their results were completely true as they gave me access to their trading site. Then, you out of nowhere, post nonsense, uneducated response to try to make up for your lack of knowledge and claim they are Scam and their actual results as photo-shopped? I don't care to defend the merchant, but people like you drive me NUTS. If you don't know something, don't just reply with stupid answers such as "Fraud" and "Photoshop" when you are, very clearly in this case, WRONG. You should ONLY respond to posts if you have actually tried something or have REAL knowledge of it and NOT "I googled and..."

--- 帖子 #499 ---

Again, you were wrong, are wrong, and now have the tail between your legs. You claimed the posting was "photo-shopped" and clearly wasn't and the site was "fraud" by your educational tools called "Googled" and were completely wrong again. I'm NOT a binary trader and don't care about this very accurate and transparent site that I continue to not mention by name to avoid giving them credit. Uneducated people like you just piss me off with one liners, shooting from the hip, pretending to "know something others don't" now stuck with tail between your legs like a jackass. If you DON'T HAVE an educated answer to someone's question, don't waste their time with foolish uneducated answers by a 8 year old such as Googled and Photo-shopped as your educated answer. Go back to your XBox.

Hi US Fantasy, I would like to try out this indicator but no arrows appear on my mt4. Your assistance would be highly appreciated, thanks in advance.

i answered this question many times.. pls place ur indicators and templates correct folders... and re start ur mt4 and apply my template . then u will get the arrows.. read the entire thread before u use this

Not sure what you mean by e-currency, however you can check optiontrade reviews too as i guess they can be a decent option powered by reputed forex broker.

Hi us fantasy, the method is looking good on my demo account, it almost feel unreal the success %. Just have two things that im not sure if are normal or im messing up. 1- Im just geting confirmation double arrows in bearish candles, not sure if is because the trend or im missing a indicator. 2- Most of the time the double confirmation arrows apear late on the candle, not when the candle spawns but a minute or two late.

Hello again, maybe some of you know slack ( https://slack.com/ ). I created a team site where we can share ideas and trade in real time.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I now understand what some of you talk about, there is a real lag from the time the candle opens to the time I get the alert. Would it be difficult to get the alert sooner? Attached Image I got the alert midway in the green candle, seems like it would be safer to get it sooner. Unless of course this is how it should be.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I used to trade with this kind of method. You might struggle in the long run if you ignore volatility. It's a reversal strategy and it works best during quiet market like after New York close and the Asian session with only European pairs. You want to prefer signals that appears around range high or low. I made a manual in which I explain when to trade this method. Attached File(s) Forex Volatility Patterns.pdf 345 KB | 2,160 downloads

That was an interesting read, thank you for the information. I will make some notes to see when the best times to trade this method is. Currently I use a demo account with MarketsWorld, and I think over 90% of the trades so far are good. I do make some mistakes sometimes and pull the trigger too fast, but the alerts are going off way too late. I am curious to see how others are doing using this trading, and if Nadex is maybe better then Marketsworld. I am still new at this trying to understand all the differences.

us fantasy, Have you ever tried to automate your system so you can use it on MT4 or do you reckon it may a bit in the hard basket section?? I have EA Builder at the moment, if I can ever sort it I will post it here for you!! Cheers crootster

--- 帖子 #520 ---
hi no mate i did not tried fully automated this method.. but one guy was done that... he was sent PM me long time ago ... he made a robot or outside running software ( he call it API or something like that )for this method and he said he need money if he gives it to me.. if u have knowledge for that then u can do it for us. people will help u to fix ur bugs ... thanks best regards!!!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
API will allow your system to be traded from your MT4 and place your trades in your offshore brokers, I wouldn't even know where to begin there. I am purely a novice trying to improve my EA Building using software anyone can use. I am part way to getting it right but I think I will be a little longer. Will let you know if I can get it to recognize all your rules correctly every time I think Trade$me or someone like that has software like that, but I have not tried them at all!! https://trade4.me/api/ https://trade4.me/ Crootster

Hi, guys. Is anybody use this strategy now? I tried last week, and won a little bit, but lost averything now... Maybe i did something wrong. I used standard us_fantasy indicators with template, when a got an alert I made a deal with 5 minute expiration. First time i got a lot of wins, but then something gone wrong Is it correct?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
can u imagine husen bolt how become fastest runner ? do u think he just practiced one week, one month , or one year ? im very sure he was practiced daily since his childhood to became this potion and he spent ton of hours of it.. but here guys looking shortcut to win.. never happen it.. sorry.. practice is must to win ..

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Something I always was wondering. When I get the alert, the time left is normally around 1 min or 2 min max, so when I start the trade, I go for 2 min (Marketsworld) Should I have the trade run for 5 min always AFTER the signal? I also had a lot of trades gone bad lately (just demo), and I notice that sometimes i get a call signal but then the candle crumbles down. Maybe the indicators could be fine tuned? I noticed if they would alert SOONER, the win ration would be much higher. Steve

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I agree with US Fantasy, you can't get rich quickly with binary trading unless you are extremely lucky. Best advice is to learn the ropes and find a method that suits your trading style best. The strategy described here is much the same as many others that are all over the net - it doesn't work for every currency pair all of the time. What you will find is that the success rates for all strategies varies wildly between currency pairs and between different market sessions and different days of the week. I have stuck with this strategy for one reason only - one of the previous threads amended the MT4 indicator to add a % win rate. This means that you can open as many pairs as you like in MT4 and monitor them across a session (New York/Europe/All Open etc). It's screening their success rate for you. It tells you how many trades were opened, how many won and the % win rate. Just order your chart windows left to right with the best pairs far left etc - makes it a bit easier to keep track of the best and worse pairs. To trade you can decide to select pairs that have &gt;75% win rates or reverse trade those that are &lt;10% successful (yes there are plenty of times with this strategy when it gives results like this). You just need to choose a threshold number of trades taken to trigger you to look at a pair. I use 3 pairs. If the strategy has opened 3 trades in MT4 for a currency pair and all 3 have won, trade this one until the success rate drops below 75%. Apply this logic to all the pairs you can trade and you'll get plenty of good signals. To help screen trades further I use bollinger bandwidth so I am certain not to take trades when the market goes flat. You should get 50-80% success with this method of trading. I have never lost more than four in a row with this method so you could eventually run a Martingale system to be sure of a decent return. Remember to stick to trading 5% or less of your balance routinely though (unless you do decide on Martingale at some stage). Finally, stay away from autotrading and signals groups etc - they'll bleed you dry fast - as usual, I learned the hard way wasting money with optionbot2, virtnext and profitmagnet. Doing much better now though. Have fun! Scott

Good day all, can anyone please recommend a good broker, alpari would have been a good one for me but there is trade limit with them. would appreciate a broker that count down from the time a contract is executed and not one that has a definite expiry time like marketsworld. thanks

Hi steve Should I have the trade run for 5 min always AFTER the signal? NO.. IF THERE REMAIN 3 MINTS THEN U CAN PLACE 3 MINT EXPIRE ORDER INSTEAD 5MINT i get a call signal but then the candle crumbles down. ? IT MAY HAPPEN DUE TO FLAT MARKETS ..

Thank you very much for this explanation. Is there some additional indicator you can suggest to add to be sure which way to trade? Is there any plans for the near future to enhance the indicator? I do believe if it would alarm sooner the win rate would be higher. Right now it seems to be almost even with the win and loses, bit I like the approach. I also would be interested to see if anyone else here is using this, and what are their outcomes? Anyone using NADEX? We can't specify times there. Steve

Hi steve actually i have no coding skill or knowledge.. so i cant understand what is the happening behind the indicators.. i know soemtimes indicators late signal and i have a small solution for that.. but it is not the best solution .. that is use ema 21 and take trades only ema 21 directions.. which mean if ma line going up side u need to takes only buy trades.. if any coder can improve signal receive ratio then win ratio will increase..

US FANTASY pretty nice and simple to trade either BO 1min or FX cash, any TF. One request though. Could you pls. adjust the code of the ! b765 MTH SMA_ADX Cross Arrow Indi Basic SetUp.ex4 so the settings of colour and size don't switch back to the original when changing TF. I could do that by myself but it's a .ex file. Thanks!

hi there is no short cuts... monitor ur charts as much as u can .. need more screen hours to get familiar the concept ..

I guess 5 min expiry timeframe is fair enough time frame to trade binary options in a good way, otherwise 60 or 30 sec expiry is merely a suicide i guess.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Thanks very much us fantasy . Your strategy is good Please i have questions: 1 can we combine your trend indicator with ema 21, or we delete one, the two seems confusing . which one can we leave in case you suggest we delete one? 2 How do we use the average directional indicator in the sub window to filter entry? 3 have you tried adx 14 to add for additional confirmation ? 4 From your experience do we trade during high volatility or ranging markets for good profit ? Thanks for your great works . I very much appreciate your openness . Expecting your reply.

Great work with adx_crossing! It works fine

Hi, this looks much better already, only KIADS Pack However, I am still struggling what to do to filter some false moves.

What do you think? Please, tell me.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
I did not mean that im looking easy money, and just be a millionaire with using this. What i ment, is when you know you are not taking taking signal. Like if its UP trend or price is above 20,50,100,200 EMA then you dont take SHORT trades, etc. EDIT: That is why im demoing, and put all my trades to excel sheet, so i will learn from mistakes.

thats is 100% true. Thats why its great to demo so i can teach my eyes to read charts and possible filter bad trades (consolidation areas) away. ended up last week 67.6% This week i stop trading on thursday cause NFP is coming and usually market moves differently on short term then.

so i think that we have to go to set maximum win trade 10 trade daily by this trade 10 20 45 100 200 after that we will close the screen if the win is 70% so 7*10=70 daily week 70* 5 =350 month 350* 4=1400 so its 140% per month by 1000 balance what u say ??????

--- 帖子 #627 ---
with 1000 balance and if you got 5 looses in a row. That will cost you 375 and if you loose that. You cant double anymore. That is suicide. I have been trading with this 3 weeks now.

rule is very simple add 21ema line to ur chart .. why we use 21ema ? it is the most trending ema in lower time frame.. so how we can use it ? when u notice up yellow arrow above the 21 ema then only u need to check buy trade. dnt take sell trades when u get down yellow arrows.. i was published video for this matter.. if u have time follow it..

Rules are simple, and i have been following them. Like previous attachment under 21 ema, short. and loosing trade. This has been happened a lot in 2 weeks. but i think i more practise will make me see that kind of scenarios. Its just hard to keep feelings out, even im trading on demo. Way too many times Signal arrow comes after move, and then i just hope move continues, but that never happens, and when i dont take trade right after signal arrow comes to wait retrace, then it does not retrace Bad luck, and too little experience yet. EDIT: And USFANTASY i want to tell you that, im not complaining when im posting my bad results. I post it cause i want to learn, somebody may say something to improve my trades. Just like you have.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
im with us fantasy this is right with 21ema also we can add this we will say that we take a trade in gbp/usd ok by 10$ if this one is loss so next trade in same currency will be 20 if its loss i will take 45 if its loss i will take 100 **** next trade meeeeeeean next signal in same currency **** what i mean in one currency i think you will not get 5 signal following in loss if one trade is win so all loss trade will void check this

This strategy SL and to how much I see all trade close 1 or 3 pip?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
this is not forex trading system, so we are not using SL

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Please say when you close the position go to the negative ?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Looks like you dont have any clue what binary is? In binary you open position for 60sec for 5min for 10min, 20min, 30min, 1hr, etc etc. If you take 5min trade, position closes automatically after 5min. And then broker calculates is in profit or loosing trade. You CAN NOT close positions when you want. So. Eather we win or loose.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
n In this system how many signal failed in one for example in gbpusd?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Download files, and test it to your self. Everyone gets different results, depending on their trading skills. Very hard to understand what you mean, when you english is extremely bad (no fence), But there are many false signals, also many winning signals. You cant backtest them cause you dont know when trading arrow comes. But you can forward test them with demo account or MT4 Tick by tick tester. 21EMA improved my signals a lot, thanks to USFANTASY to point it out. Im looking to go live december. So theres still 2 months of practise.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hello MedIce, I am curious about binary options. Could you kindly clarify this doubt for me? Say, for a 5 minute trade, your position goes as predicted within 2 minutes. Now can we close the trade or do we need to wait for the full 5 minutes? Thanks

--- 帖子 #639 ---
There are option to close trade before but, you wont get as much profit as to wait option to end. and this is option is not available on 60sec 120sec 300sec trades. Only on high/low trades.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Not all option dealers offer an early closeout. It varies depending on the type of programming they're using and their set-up. Anyway given the price a trader has to pay for an early close it only helps the dealer and very rarely helps the trader.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Thanks MedIce for the quick response.

Thanks EyeBall for your inputs.

Added 21Ema on chart and took 5 trades today. By adding 21EMA it cuts signals alot, which is not bad thing at all. Waited 5 hours on those 5 trades. Results wasent that good tho. Attached Image Attached Image EDIT: Took two more trades.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
last night is not gud for trade binary at all .. reason is there is very low momentum due to bank holidays .. see the calendar MonOct 10 All Day JPY Bank Holiday All Day CAD Bank Holiday All Day USD Bank Holiday so before start ur trading, pay attention those important things.. if not then u have to pay it via loss trade

--- 帖子 #647 ---

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hey, I added some indicators after i added 21EMA so not all my trades are by the rule. But have you checked that when you add indicators that each indicators DLL imports are allowed?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi medIce ! I got us fanatasys version to work with alerts! Although kiads version does not update the chart with the indicators... i have to manually reload the indicator for them to appear... Owell, i got us fantasys to work so its all good Thanks!

Can you provide any more information? I think this happens every day to me on Nadex with each different indi i have tried. I think my discipline changes for the worse with each win under my belt. I would like to learn of others thoughts on this theory.

hi wish u a happy new year and green pips year... best regards!!!

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Been looking at your screenshots buddy and it seems you have 2-4 min expiry. Correct me if am wrong. The yellow arrow appears at the end of a candle then you have to wait for the other two arrows. When the two arrows appear, check remaining time to current candle close then place trade... I have had some rough record on my demo. Am not sure how you are achieving these records

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Nice work us fantasy . can you point me to what the circles mean post? also, advice on timing of entry

I'd like to know is it possible to get the Alert to tell me when the yellow arrow forms? The reason I ask is because I don't get the alert until the candle with the Green and Blue or Red and Pink is part of the way through it's time regards, Ricky

--- 帖子 #712 ---
one night u can not understand this .. need more screen trained eye to get the right trade. and we not just follow the allow arrows.

i saw some coders code alert for that yellow arrow too.. not in thread area .. i noticed it other thread. so if you do any research then u can find it

--- 帖子 #714 ---
its my fault sorry about this,i found the next candle will continue the pre trend when we see the signal, so its enough for five minutes. but as for binary option,i think the most important answer is the broker. good luck to u .

--- 帖子 #745 ---
sorry mate im not a coder so i have no chance to help , currently we have only one alert system and i already added it here.. hope u were notice it

--- 帖子 #746 ---
kiads pack is little bit advance mate... use both and u will feel the different..

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Understood. However, before you got back to me I had a coder put an push notification alert in the SMA Crossover, which not only sends an alert to the MT4, but also sends a alert to your phone. happy to share if any wants it. US_Fantasy my other question being very important to you is: The "! b765 MTH SMA_ADX Cross Arrow Indi Basic SetUp.ex4" alert. I tried a few times installing it into my charts. It shows up with all the arrows right away, but as the chart goes forward with its candles it does not display the arrows moving forward. Only when you first install it. Can you clarify why or how to proper install this alert? Please if you could be specific. Thanks

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi I decade test your system.just I have a question? Do you still trade live with this method? If yes could you please tell about your money management Thanks

I would be interested in the answer to your question but I doubt he/she is willing to share openly. Also looking at their (tinygiant) screenshot, they don't seem to be using this method (at least from the trades placed with IQ Options). I'm not trying to sound negative but there are people here who are only interested in taking but don't like to share.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Seems quite consistent strategy. Trading all the signals irrespective of the trend and at the end of the day the account is always in positive. Today's trading Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Yes i did snap with my mobile, As all can see Real Account on images. But there are some traders here on FF nothing will be good enough for them to be convinced some things work. They are too negative to see Real Value which is right infront of their eyes. Regarding me providing Signals, i really would like to help struggling Binary Traders win daily but for that to happen its gotta be serious traders with serious attitude to win , not passerbys. Providing signals can sometimes cause me to miss trades of my own,lol. Then you have those that expect me to accept 100 rupees, or none at all for my services LOL,LOL,LOL I think they fail to realise my trading account is in £££££££££.

Hi Baba ive pm you with some humble suggestions to update, i have many more but cant remember all right now. This is my imput for the benefit of all. FF have been good to me, learnt so much. A big thank you to all the Positive traders that brings light to this forum. Stay Green All

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Thank you 4undmanager the reason is Some of us are too busy making money and with life , also because too many negative nay sayers here on FF. that have ridiculous request to convinced them your stuff is working. simply because they have been burnt along the line. Im not sure why they think anyone owes them that.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Hello tiny giant just show the nay sayers and negative people ur last week balance nd trades they all will stop saying negative that is the best way to answer them and i hope u can do this as u hv £££££££ balance

Would somebody be able to email the EA to me? The iPad will not open the files and the laptop will not let me get onto this website...... Aghhhhh Apple computers! i will PM my address to whoever can do it.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Hi US Fantasy Could you please kindly add and send me your indicator with the alert signal notification. Your "ADX Crossover MT4 Indicator". Your assistance to this will be highly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Tinygiant, thank you for responding to my message. I'm not trying to be negative and fully understand some of your points. My point is very simple, UsFantasy has shared a method for free but you are now sending PM to people, why not share your ideas on here for free? If UsFantasy had the same attitude, you won't have the system or indicators to help you? It's very simple really. Share these updates here so that we can all continue to add value and maybe suggest different ways at looking at the suggestions This is my point, you are offering a paid service and looking to make money from people by using what you got for free.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
The system works on binary options.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Yes tinygiant be positive here and here are people are sharing free stuff but u r contacting and convincing people to pay for your ££££ balance and showing them 4 months old balance if u hv something really working then post regular then one can trust on ur words jist posting screenshots of ur balance and messaging people to work for u and pay u is not gonna work people here are not that innocent u too showed my ur performance one day and asked me that its only a trial of three days in which you made nothing except equal anount of otms and itms thats not gonna work people are smarter here so please if u want to sell ur servie then do other things for marketing

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I am an affid binary trader - I do the same as you but simply use a good scalping tool on the time frame I trade i.e. 5 min signal for 1 min trade etc. there are many.

anyone trade this on nadex?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
some clear rules for entry ? other that the alert coming on ? some guesses 1) alert --&gt; yellow arrow previous candle ---&gt; double arrow next candle 3) take trade only if it appears in first two minutes of the 5 min candle, 2) take trade only if its in direction of super trend indicator ? the yellow line 3) take trade only if the previous candle ( with justin arrow) is in same direction as the super trend and the signal ? 4) as i went through posts, time on us fantasy trades vary, usually around 3 minutes expiry.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
but binary options is scam, how do you expect your "strategy" to win.... lololol

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Us fantacy &amp; everyone thanks for sharing useful information. I used 5mint for the 5 min demo trade last Friday. The result is 17 trade 15wins and it is very wonderful. I just followed the signal after the alert rang and I did not devise anything. But I think that ingenuity is necessary to maintain this winning percentage. Add Stoch and M15 Stoch from the next trade and if both Stoch are moving in the direction of the arrows, increase the credibility. Also add Super Bollinger and 5MA. I am a beginner so please advise. I have a few questions. How do you use 21MA? Trend confirmation, to avoid the range? 21 MA, look at how you use？ How to use kias pack ? Kids using them together increases the reliability of the signal? Tell us also comes with ADX. Please tell me if you know someone raise the odds of 5 mint indicator combinations and ingenuity. 5 mint and your opinion is great. Thank you. From Japan.

You're unable to make money using a free trading method but you are happy to pay someone to send you signals from the free method via Whatsapp!! Is tinygiant making you write this as part of your marketing to fool more people to join your paid whatsapp group? If you are unable to generate consistent results keep working at it, don't give your money to someone for less than average signals.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Please dont write lies, Iam new in binary and ask tiny for help and yes Tinygiant sent via whatsapp signal, but for free, I dont pay for anything... And I think If you kindly ask Tiny, you can also try happy trading

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I have to agree that you're new to trading. If you are taking 1min and 5min signals from a whatsapp group, you will probably lose all your money very soon. The best thing to do is spend time and learn the process yourself. Secondly, If you read one of Tinygiant's post, he mentions people asking to pay him money (that's not a lie). Quote below: I don't need tinygiant or anyone for signals, I'm happy with my results and methods. Best of luck with your trading, hopefully you learn the lessons you need to learn.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
awesome mate.. keep practice and share your results.. it will be a good motivations to others..

--- 帖子 #793 ---
im happy if u got the right track... congrats mate.. do practice more and more

--- 帖子 #794 ---
How do you use 21MA? Trend confirmation, to avoid the range? 21 MA, look at how you use？ we use it as clock angles. 12-2 angle we do buy, 4-6 we do sell. 3 clock we do nothing and it is a range .. simply like that.. if u are new then first follow the main system once u practice then u can follow kiads method. keep ur practice mate.. hope u will learn more and earn more.

Hi Us fantasy, You use chart 5mins or 1 mins?. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Yesterday and today tradings.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Inserting level 25 in the ADX indi seems to filter out whole lot of bad signals. For call I entered only if the green line of the ADX has crossed above this level (at the time of sig) and for put only if red line was above this level, of course after having fulfilled all other criteria as mentioned in this thread. Also SR line have to be taken into consideration, if the price has already reached SR then I avoided entering. Result seems good.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Sorry, I know English not very well. Could you explain more these words - "Also SR line have to be taken into consideration, if the price has already reached SR then I avoided entering"? What is a SR line?

hI us FANTASY, I tested your strategy especially for yellow arrow: justin MA cross over and if it was taken rite a way and follow the trend, actually it will produce 70% win ratio and quit profitable enough. I would like to use "Kiads pack" but i cant find the right and same setup as your original indys, i tried many times even your setup given in below post, but still cant find the same setup. can you help me with this issue? as i thought kiads pack more light to my computer. thanks in advance for your great work.

Hi @us_fantasy - Really appreciate the help in sharing such an awesome strategy with us here on FF. It looks very easy to follow and also profitable as well. I have read through all the 42 pages and it is really interesting to read and learn from people here. Right now I am still demoing the same and there are some losses due to my error. Look forward to do better and comfortable with demo before i can move to live. anyway will keep you posted. Thank you again. Also was wondering if we can include a filter to take EMA 21 into account before alerting which can further filter improve the performance of the system. Please let me know your thoughts. Hi @tinygiant can you please also pm me your suggestions. Looking forward to hear from you.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Hi I had been exploring forex for a few years, but as I was mostly reliant on EA and had never taken the efforts to understand the market. For the past 2 weeks I have been trying out this strategy and also have been learn the various indicators as to what each of the indicators do. Had a very bad week last week where I had more OTMs than ITMs. Today I seem to have got the hang of it and have been doing the following: Installed the "5mint binary" into the indicators and template. Installed the "SMA CrossOver_Justin_Alert" along with the existing "SMA CrossOver_Justin" where there is a minor change but seem to overlap with the yellow arrow at most the right places. Where we need to enter the trade. Also this one has a "Red" and "Blue" instead of a single "Yellow" arrow. Also included the "MA 21" as instructed by US_Fantasy. Today I have been trying to trade as per the rule where if there is a "CALL" signal, "SMA CrossOver Justin" and the candle is on the "MA21" I go for a buy, vice versa for the "PUT". Also have the "Super Trend" indicator in place. Where I am trading mostly with the trend. Today performance has definitely improved but still not up to the mark. Will keep practicing and hope to get better. Will keep everyone posted. Please suggest if i am doing something wrong so that I can improve myself to do better. Looking forward for your input.

GDMFX still offer binarys 60 seconds and 5 min and more...Trading of mt4 also

--- 帖子 #836 ---
I think ducascopy acctually have spreads on binarys and that is a huge NO-NO it needs too be eneaugh with the 10-20 % their shaving of your trades...And all binarys are inhouse meaning you trade against the broker and that is why i stay out of binarys mostly its better too use the same strategie for small scalps with high leverage target of 3 pips stoploss at 2 you will have much more risk/reward ratio than with bins and you dont have the time too watch either a 3 pip win with 10 lots is 300 dollars not bad for a coupple of minutes...

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Gomarkets and Solidary Markets are still available. binaryoptionstrading.clmforex.com too. Note that ESMA rules only apply to EU based brokers. I am looking for brokers that offer binaries on MT4. If you know more of them, let me know.

Hi guys, nice thread! Good strategy too, although i find it to be a bit time-consuming sitting infront of the PC monitor all day waiting for the perfect alignment of arrows to ensure an ITM trade. Binary options is still a big deal in my country. Can any of the Master Traders here develop a super accurate buy/sell arrow that can predict price movement for 45seconds. I once came across a video made by a guy(franco) 3years ago. His white arrows predict price movements for approximately 30 - 50 seconds with very high accuracy. But unfortunately, he is no longer into binary option and won't share his secret formula. This is a business proposition, so i am willing to pay for it. Anyone with the capability to develop this kind of system, please contact me. Lets work together. Cheers!

Love this system. I am having good results so far. Thank you for sharing it!!

--- 帖子 #847 ---
First of all thank you very much us_fantasy for this beautiful strategy I have analyzed the charts and indicator signals , and found a zone with the highest probability trade . Step 1 - right click on the ADX indicator Step 2 - add levels 10 to 80 Step 3 wait for the right time to make trade Do not fight the trend ! CALL " yellow arrow followed by green arrow in the blue arrow " ADX levels Green 20+ rising Red 20- falling Blue under 40 up to 50 rising PUT " yellow arrow followed by pink arrow in the red arrow " ADX levels Red 20+ rising Green 20+ falling Blue under 40 to 50 rising Happy trading

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Keep us posted. Are you using the indicators first uploaded in the first page.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
I have to say this one was very helpful. Thanks a lot for sharing these. I got an example for a put trade that just won a while ago. ADX level green was at 10 and red was at 30. The blue line was above level 50. Great setup for a put trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's an example for a call trade that gave me a heart attack because it came so close to not winning. Green was above 20 and red below 20. Although it can be barely seen I had to take a closer look at it. Blue was above 40. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Congrats on winning trades You got quite lucky on the CALL trade , next time fighting the trend can cost you ! Good luck

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Decided to finish the day with 10-2. I was so focused with trading I was not able to get screenshots of the trades. I'm sorry about that. When a signal shows up I carefully analyze the ADX as per the rules shared by zerounu. The rules he shared got that 10 wins. Next time I'll do my best to get screenshots after each trade and try to be more relaxed trading LOL.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Glad to hear you have good results Just curious did you followed the trend or didnt matter ?

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Hi Pro, Could you give us more than example by screenshots? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hello, do you think that this strategy can be used in forex trading? I think that spread can be a problem in some pairs, limiting the amount of pairs and trades per day. The exit might not give enough pips to be profitable.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
This sure is stupid but at least I'm being honest. I don't follow the trend and it doesn't matter as long as the rules you shared are met. I'll continue demo trading this way and see if I continue to get good results. With binary options trading we only need price to be higher or lower in the expiration time we choose. Basically, we're only looking for the next bar/candlestick to have higher/lower open and close price and also higher/lower wicks than the previous candlestick/bar. This is why I said that trend don't matter for me. A single bar/candlestick will determine the result of the trade. You can win or lose a trade by just a micro pip. Just my two cents really. I don't mean to say I'm totally ignoring the trend with this strategy. For now I'll keep things simple and continue demo trading this way.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
hi.. Thanks for this strategy us fantasy i am new to this site and i thought with martingale this was very profitable ..any way i am still in demo mode.. first signal lost with $1 then take $ trade in seconded signal..i have try it and never hit 6th step.. any ideas guy

Hello bcarbon, I've tried to trade this strat with Nadex, but can not seem to catch entry in time. Which strike do you use? OTM, ATM, or ITM. I'm assuming ITM where you receive close to $20 to $30 per contract. I understand you use the same indicators as post 1, but can you please upload a picture of your chart so I can see any differences. Nadex is truly the best broker I've used, but I would love to finally make some earnings with it, thanks. And congrats on your great results.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
bro can you give me new update indicator for binary

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Please teach me. Bro I need your help Please

--- 帖子 #872 ---
I can see that you have been doing your work!!! :0). Sometimes when a new cycle starts, the two top strikes are already gone (or the two bottom ones). If that is the case just pass on that one. You want to put the odds in your favor. I only take the two top ones for a sell or the two bottom ones for a buy, if they are not there then I just pass. I always take ITMs, that puts the odds in my favor. (ATMs are gambling imo unless you use the least attractive price and OTM are out of the question. They have the least probability to end ITM that's why they are so cheap) . You'll get the best prices at the opening of a cycle. Check the arrows first, then check what Nadex is offering you. Is it reasonable? if not, just pass and go to another pair. I got my indicators and template from Post #1. I just added bbands and S/R levels. https://www.screencast.com/t/FC8z7e5XZM

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Ok, got it...thanks for the reply

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Thank you for providing a good indicator. I'm translating from Japanese to google, so it may not be correct English. Sorry. I changed the circle to an arrow and I can not see the originally set arrow. Add other indicators, add my own rules, and win 76%-97%/day. However, I do not trade for 5 minutes from the moment of the sign appearance. Purchase the 5 minute end option. For example, if the sign appears 14:12, I will purchase an option that ends at 14:15. The average number of trades per hour is 5 to 6 times (7 currency pairs monitored) Thank you.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
I tried to run indicator for few days , and the result is pretty bad.Best shot is AUDUSD with 66.67% win ratio. Does anyone know what I am wrong ?

--- 帖子 #876 ---
@acinmavi try the system without calendars near (past and future).. and only with liquid pairs on correct market hours. Try to practise how to trade binary too.. The system is not bad but it's not the best system to trade. Arrows tend to repaint on big market movements.. so be cautelous by using it.

That is quite a few trades for the ASIAN session. I am only able to trade from 7pm until 11pm est.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
You are so wrong!!!! I never mentioned Asian session for once. Second, if an hour has, lets say the Asian session lasts only 4 hours (it lasts longer) and there are 12 five minute binaries per hour, that makes 48 in the Asian session per pair. I trade 7 pairs so that is 48X7= 336 opportunities to trade. However, I did NOT say that I traded all of them in the Asian session. If at least you make the effort to read properly and understand what the system is about then you would get out a winner. I did the work and I love it. You can do the same.

Hi Guys I am new to this thread and have read about all 46 pages.I am not clever with technical stuff but one thing I came to realize is that when you use this system of US Fantasy (which I think is great ) -I see the arrows forming very late on the candle. Meaning if the yellow arrow appears it take very long for the other (get into the trade arrow) appears and that makes your 5 minutes go into the next candle which result in a loss. Is there a way to get the arrows to appear quicker ? Thank you in advance

this indicator is suitable for sideway trend you should not use it in bearish trend or bullish trend, it just gave too much false signal

SurprimeL, that strategy looks useful, how can I use it? I just see an image here. Is it something I could use with TradingView? I am working on what may be a strategy right now (just doing some backtesting and then may post results...).

I think you may be the only one getting this high win rate on here. But you are I think putting your own twist on system by adding in S/R levels (which can be subjective) and BBs (what setting). It would be nice if you could provide details of HOW you are doing it. Because others are using this system and not getting anywhere near that win rate.

The idea behind this strategy is pretty good actually. ADX measures trend's power and Moving Average usually shows good moments of tend changing and gaining a new direction. So we have a trend power on the first plate and trend direction on the second, and we don't have toons of indicators like in some systems proposed "here and there". I like the idea. But anyway, any strategy must be adjusted to the human's character, if you're a sanguine - most likely M5 timeframe and sharp/fast/multiple trades is yours, and you'll be comfortable with it, but if you're more, like, melancholic - then possibly you need to switch to M30-H1 and take trades in a slower pase.
