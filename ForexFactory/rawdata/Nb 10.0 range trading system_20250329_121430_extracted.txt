Please go to this thread to download the 10.0 system. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=308304 In this thread we will talk about range trading with the 1H CTR BOTH EA. We will use the 4H CTR and Daily recovery EA for 2nd and 3rd level trades. I traded this system through the first week of August and the results were stunning. These are live trades using .03 and .05 cents lots. Here are my results: Gross Profit: 106.58 Gross Loss: 15.64 Total Net Profit: 90.94 The 90.94 was an incredible 8.8% increase in my account of 1035 dollars. That was trading .03 and .05 pennies lots. I cant really expect to do that every week but it sure was a nice start. Total for the month of August 2011= 22% of the account post 147 pg. 10 You can use the CTR EAs whenever range conditions are met or you can constantly range trade 24/7 while using just the low volatility currency pairs. See my excel sheet and use only the following pairs listed as volatility of 1-3. From two months experience I dropped a couple of pairs but these will be the ones I will use: aud/jpy, aud/nzd, aud/usd, cad/jpy, chf/jpy, eur/gbp, gbp/cad, gbp/usd, nzd,chf, nzd/jpy, usd/cad, usd/jpy That gives me a mix of aud-3 cad-3 chf-2 jpy-5 eur-1 gbp-3 nzd-3 usd-4 I did not use nzd/usd to give me better balance, I chose all the #3 volatile pairs except aud/chf. Don’t trust the chf right now, it is not ranging very well. I chose two gbp because the gbp has been ranging very well the last two years. So until they stop ranging I am going to trade it. This list of pairs traded can be changed from time to time based on market volatility. For example if the GBP starts making headlines I will drop the gbp/cad and possibly the gbp/usd.

So for Monday morning after the JPY session I will start the EAs on the 12 pairs and see what happens. I will post my results and help you with my recovery methods needed to do range trading.

Hi nanningbob! Will you run this EA via VPS? Forexcube

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Send me some info to nanningbob@msn.com and I will look into it in the morning. This system is hard to report range trading. I usually just post the increases rather than the individual trades.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Fantastic!!! subscribed Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Bob, How do you plan on using the 4h CTR as a recovery ea? What's your entry criteria?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
What a wonderful work man! Thank you I will stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This is just theory and I am studying this now. Remember CTR is a concept less than a month old so my mind is developing it. But there is a run on the daily but the highs are going back up close to previous highs. Probably the new Resistance is formed. Look at daily chart.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
The 4H chart looks like this the highs are hitting the black and red lines of the 2MA and 8 MA (you can use the 10.0 blank to see this. NO trades here because the eur/gbp is a low volatile currency. but seeing the highs hit these lines may signal an end to the run early.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
So seeing price forming a Resistance point leads to good trades on the 1H chart. So the 1H CTR makes the trades here. With 4 trades you probably easily wiped out any DD on this pair.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
That is a theory I will be working on. With my AUD/CHF trade now 800 some pips in the hole I will need several trades to clean this one out. So I will try this theory on it. Dont worry about the netative pips It is several .03 trades but will make good practice for counter trading. I will counter trade with .05 and .06 lots to try to clean it out. May take me all month but sooner or later the AUD should rebound. I hope. Either way I am not in serious account trouble but it will be a challenge. If I do it, it will be the biggest DD I have ever brought back to 0. I love a good challenge.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
oooops I forgot to post the 4H CTR chart here it is. 4H CTR may not work well with low volatile currencies. You get only one good 4H trade here but 4 solid ones with the 1H. That is the kind of thing I need to study before making decisions but that is something I am looking at and trying to trade live now.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I upgraded the 4H EAs. Go to the 10.0 trend page to get the upgrade and why I did it.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is kind of funny. I posted 3 systems and this is the one I am trading live and it has the least amount of attention. Ok my two week results: Aug. 1-6 = 8.8% of my account Aug. 7-14 = 2.3 % of my account Normally I show pictures but because I added and subtract funds this week you really cant see the rise. I had some DD this week which I will talk about when I get home tonight. Some really unexpected moves for Aug. Some currencies moved more than Aug. 2008 and this time I survived and made a small profit. Will get into why.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
time for questions... - mainly 4hr or 1hr BB entries? - leaving the EA trading all the time (apart from news stories)? - using re-entries? - set tp and sl amounts?

The aud/chf is my nightmare trade of the week. From the entrance at a support on the buy 1H to it finally reversed was -1400 pips. I have never tried to recover such a big number before. What saved me a lot of headaches was 10.0 kept me from having too many levels to recover from sooooooooooo ............. I have gotten back most of my deficit. My only losses in trading for the week is I closed 2 levels that I had entered violating my 10.0 recovery. If I had stuck with the basic 10.0 my 2nd level would have entered and I would be close to BE now. Instead I took a couple of losses covered by my profits and my recovery has brought me back 2/3 of BE. So instead of dealing with 4 or 5 trades and being patient I have done 10 trades of which 7 are winners 2 were losers and 1 loser trade left. Anyways I have almost finished recovery of a -1400 deficit (something I have never done before). I dont know if that is good news or bad news but one thing is certain. I wont be range trading aud/chf since with this latest move it has now become a category 4 currency pair.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I dont know if telling you this is good news or bad. But even the most dramatic moves can be recovered if you have a way of knowing when to get in and when to reenter and when to get out. Dang what a beast. The bottom line is this I had enough profit last week on all my other trades to cover this entire negative trade. I could close out the rest of this trade now and still make a teeny profit for the week. Now that is strong for this range system.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Studying a currency's tendencies is also helpful in recovery but I knew the aud/chf has a V-turn tendency when it moves big. This is also helpful to know. Most trading gurus tell you about their successful trades. I think I learn more about trading to sometimes talk about the ugly ones. None have been more ugly than this. With the right lot size to account size you can survive these things.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
One last thing about recovery trades. Recovery trades and negative DD are simple interest trades. In other words they happen once and they are done, no compounding. Winning trades are compound interest. In other words profits continue to increase the account and each winning trade is like banking compound interest over a long period of time. Losing trades and DD are simple interest in that once they are done they no long continue to add to the loses. So as my DD grew and diminished in size, my winners kept increasing my account like compound interest does. My losing aud/chf trade did not keep growing but eventually lessened in size until it was closed with profits. In any case my account got bigger and my loser trade is gone and cant take away my profits anymore. My winning trades however, will keep being added to my account. I dont know if this makes sense to you but that is how I am beginning to look at it. My account keeps growing from my winners and my DD is like breathing in and out. It gets bigger, then smaller, then bigger then smaller but the bottom line keeps growing. I like that, but very complicated logic.

Hi Bob, I ran CTR on H1 and H4 on 2 seperate platforms ,the remarkable thing is 10.0 made around 320 pips on both !! I didnt have much time last week so more or less I let it do its own thing !! I also closed out all positions at the end of the week . This is looking great , thanks Bob.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
ianp, are you willing to share your setting file?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
It is OOTB , I have not changed any settings .

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Can someone help clarify for me - I used the NB 5.0 counter trend system so maybe that is making me a bit confused. Rules If a candle high/low moves inbetween the daily MA's then we are in a pause of trend or start of renage trading and looking to use CTR system. Now with 4hr system are we now looking to ctr back into the prevailing trend ie if trend is down price action has now retraced back inbetween MA's on daily then we drill down to 4hr and look to sell using perhaps RWB multi indicator to show over brought Or as we are now in range we just trade like the old NB5.0 and trade up and down as dictated by RBW indicators In 1 hr CTR do the same but on low volitile pairs (trade both ways ) or again are we looking to get back in on trend ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
For Nanningbob I had followed your threads about your exploits in range trading. I do like most of it the original idea, how it is executed, overall wonderful strategies and could be executed even for the ppl with the iq that is less than genius. I loved most range trading strategies as that has given the best profit and has stood the test of time. Im not sure if someone has pointed before, i just wondering why so many pairs? Or did i making a mistake that your strategy can be executed for 1 -2 pairs only.Im only am comfortable trading 2 - 3 pairs max as it can daunting to monitor 10 pairs at once ,especially using small account. The potential drawdown can be disastrous if played wrong.Thats what keeping me from trying your strategies..or is there a hidden reason trading so many pairs at once?Forgive me if im wrong ,i only had few years trading forex at thats only limited to a few pairs,compared to your vast experience. I'd care to hear your thoughts about this.Thank You

--- 帖子 #26 ---
This is a range trading system using low volatility pairs. We really dont read the 1 Day chart unless we need to recover a trade. We just take a handful of pairs and let the EA run and then counter trade the runners. That is why we are using low volatility pairs.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
With the big moves of late, very wise advice from Bob to remember to trade the right lot size ie. .01 per $2000. I bet a lot of accounts were wiped out this month that were previously trading lot sizes too large for account. PS: I have been out of market all month, might dip my feet in again.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
So it is just set up profile of pairs (low volitiliy) 1hr attach the CTR1hr both ea and let it do its thing and manage the runners as you say as per previous nb5.0 ie use recovery or hedge as appropriate. Is it not the purpose of the daily charts you produced to identify ranging opportunities as oppossed to trending opportunities or is it that this is not necessary (as you seem to suggest) as they will all range at some point and the low volitility means you are not going to get into too much do do if it goes against you and with exp and skill you should be able to manage the recovery out of these situationsabout 4hr ctr is this to be used on volitile pairs and like old 5.0 Finally on 1hr ctr what is a suitable dd in pips to look at recovery it used to be 200 in 4hr nb5.0 so is it 50 in 1hr??

--- 帖子 #29 ---
So far I am only using 4H CTR in recovery. I have some things I think it can be used for but I need to do more testing with that one. My theory is to use medium volatility pairs with the 4H but have not tested that yet. The 1H I am just letting it fly 24/7 and counter trading the runners. So far so good. Got caught with my pants down some last week but what normally would have been massive DD ended up staying under 20% of my account. There was a time I went over 20% but I added funds to bring it under and closed a couple of aud/chf trades. I have now banished the aud/chf to another level so I wont deal with that one again but recuperating from a -1400 pip DD on that pair has kind of got me pumped. Normally that would have been a disaster.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
And Finally on 1hr ctr what is a suitable dd in pips to look at recovery it used to be 200 in 4hr nb5.0 so is it 50 in 1hr?? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/m...ading_dark.gif

--- 帖子 #31 ---
As you know trend trading gets all the good press and the glory but counter trend / range trading is considered to be more risky and needing much more skill. I find range trading to be much more predictable and profitable than trend trading. Kind Regards

This is the strength of 1H CTR. It knocks down a lot of trades on low volatility pairs. Since Aug. 1, and this is a live account, it has taken161 closed trades. 133 are winners 28 losers for a win percentage of 82.6% During that time I suffered some of the biggest moves in Forex since Oct. 2008. aud/chf -1400, gbp/cad -780, nzd/chf -800, were some of my DD. Despite that 10.0 kept me from entering too often and having too many levels. I waited patiently for my reentry and tried not to guess at it. Each one, except for the gbp/cad so far, came back and broke even or even made a nice profit. I have an incredible 13% increase of my original amount profit through today. Yet I am trading 3 penny or 5 penny trades. Why is this working. With 3 penny trades I only need 35 pips to make a dollar, 70 pips to make two dollars, and 100 pips to make 3 dollars on most currencies. Multiply that times 133 winners and you can see the money add up fast but the DD are comparatively small. I cant tell you how tickled I am at these numbers. If I can knock that down in what is really a horrible month for range trading, just imagine what will happen if prices do range. I mean I invented a trend system and a counter trend system to go with 10.0 but if this keeps up, why bother. I have my money maker. Lets do the math. aud/chf -1400 x .03 = 42.00 dollars down at one point. With 1000 in the bank that is easy to handle. 133 winners at 1.69 average win = 224.77 then subtract a small handful of losers and you can see where this is going. The DD breathes in and out, in and out, but the winners just keep adding to the pile. This is really exciting to me. This is like comparing compound interest to simple interest. The winners keep compounding, the losers are a one time event. Well time for bed. Oh that is why I use 10-15 currencies to trade. While a couple are running away from you the rest are piling on the profit.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Nanning - been following your thread with interest. I am glad it is working. I am surprised Mr Hepwood hasnt got involved yet, to create a single super dooper EA yet. Should we gently drop him or some of the other talents on FF a hint?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thank you for your note. I dont know why but FOREX seems to be a different animal when it comes to trading rules. I finally believed them to be mostly garbage. 1. For example, you are told to trade one currency and get to know it, yet almost all investor advice I have heard, read, or seen tells you to diversify your portfolio. Trading many currencies, if you choose a good mix, allows for that. 2. You are told to have tight SL yet I have never heard of a broker advise a client to put in a trade with 1/8 of a penny stop on a stock trade. Yet that is what is done in Forex. 30 pip stop is 3/10 of a penny. I dont know anyone who trades like this with stocks, futures, bonds, commodities, on and on. 3. You are told to never do multiple levels or trades, (I don't mean martingale either) Yet it is common practice in stocks, etc. to add to your position over time and increase your holdings. Buy and hold is the watchword of the stock market. The big boys who trade with millions on the line buy and hold and add to their positions over time. I really didnt become profitable in Forex until I threw out practically every piece of advice I ever got from so called Forex gurus. I think they just try to sell the rehashed garbage of everyone else. If you think about it, a lot of what I teach is based on Non Forex investment strategy. Start small, add to your position over time, diversify, and give your trade space and time to move in your direction. That is basic stock strategy 101. What is a stock purchase plan at almost every company in the world? Set aside part of your paycheck every month and buy their stock and hold until your retire. What do I do? I buy at a price. If it works I close and make profit, if it doesnt at some point I buy again, and sometimes I buy again and then I follow the rule that is 100% true all the time in FOREX. What goes down must come up and what goes up must come down. Time is always on your side if you trade with some smarts and patience.

He will notice at some time. Once word gets around that Bob is making money in a bad FOREX market, he will stop by.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Bob your using the 1hr CTR with only the trend. 4hr CTR with ranging ?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
YUP me too.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Page 1 Post 1 first sentence: In this thread we will talk about range trading with the 1H CTR BOTH EA. We will use the 4H CTR and Daily recovery EA for 2nd and 3rd level trades. I traded this system through the first week of August and the results were stunning. These are live trades using .03 and .05 cents lots. Here are my results:

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hope phover will code the things i talked to him about...i'd like an automatic "volatility level" recognition in the manager, so that as soon as i look at the chart i see the "volatility class" of that pair, so no need to have notes or so....and when the classification changes we..change it either in the code!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Flame bob uses the 1hr counter trade both as one of his strategies is this the same as your ea1 automatic buy/sell detection ea and will it continue to look for opportunities after each trade closes

--- 帖子 #41 ---
yes! if u activate it with reentry mode on u'll have an expert that automatically after having closed an operation will look for another entry!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Bob, When I shut down and re-open my platform, if price is still outside the bb, the ea will re-enter even though there is a current trade open for that currency. It just keeps re-entering every time I close and re-open platform whilst price is outside bb. Does the same if I reload the template. It might be worth getting the ea to check for an open trade before entering.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Bob, this range trading system with the 1H CTR is amazing. It just picks off one trade after another. It tested well on my demo account, then once I got the ECN issue figured out last week with my live broker, last two days has generated 588 pips, with only one trade (AUD/NZD), which is trying to run away, but still in range. The hard to believe part is I am giving up a profitable system (5.3) to move to what I hope to be a more profitable system. We will see, but a good start. My hat is off to you for your insight, sharing and teaching - thank you. I have started another live account so I can separate the counter/range trading and trend trading results. Counter / range trading is really my comfort level and I really enjoy going against the trend and working out of recovery holes. Although the recent CHF and AUD run was a challenge, but made it through with a little profit along the way. I am working on my skills with trend trading, so thought it was good to separate out those two styles. Anyway, happy to share results for those who want to follow along. People which are not following the range system are missing out on a great opportunity to pile on the pips. Best of trading to you. George

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Any ideas on why the ea re-enters when when the platform is re-started?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I think I may of found the problem. I changed the hard code from .03 lots to .02 lots. I already had an open order at .03. When I changed the lot size and re-compiled, the ea re-entered immediately at .02

--- 帖子 #46 ---
With the reentry EAs. Are you setting up two instances of each chart? One for longs and one for shorts and then just letting it run auto? Are you using two instances of MPTM, one to manage long trades, and one to manage short trades?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Bob, Are you using MPTM to manage the trades?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
NO, these pairs basically arent going anywhere. Would have to be some really really super news to have them go whacky out of range. 4H system it was needed dont see a need here.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
What is your TP point then if I may ask? I must have missed it reading the docs.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I am using it differently. Started the CTR BOTH EA Sunday evening on 15 pairs, H1 TF with MPTM BE 40 pips and BE Profit of 30 pips, no TP but moving the SL up every 10 pips. It is running on automatic ever since (have not had cause to intervene) and the results have been astonishing. Using 20 cents per trade the profit thus far is $240 and floating DD is $70. As far the volatility of the pairs are concerned I use mataf indicator and just to give you a rough idea of the recent wild fluctuations, the average daily pip movement for the very stable USDJPY was. last 10 weeks 71.4 pips last 5 weeks 83.8 pips last 2 weeks 98.9 pips last week 60 pips. The fluctuations of some other pairs jumped from around 200 to over 400 pips! Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I just started my demo a few hours ago. Does the BOTH EA reenter as well? My charts just answered my question. LOL

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Would you be willing to post that indicator here?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Mike It is not an indicator for mt4, but a utility provided by mataf, you can find it here http://www.forexticket.co.uk/en/tools/02-01-volatility . Bob`s spread sheet is excellent, however, if you wish to see volatility over short periods this will do the job. For instance you can see the jump in the volatility of EURCHF. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks, Have you encountered any situations of needing to use recovery so far?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thus far none. This EA is very neat, at 08:31 open a buy GBPUSD, closed at 11:51 with 101 pips profit. At 11:53 opened a sell GBPUSD, now it is -82 pips loss. So thus far there is no need for recovery. One thing I learned in using recovery is that if you use it often for trades which are around 100 pips down there is a danger of a huge DD when you have a long run of 400 to 600 pips which are very common these says. Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Bob in looking at the code for this ea i noticed conditions for buy and sell which are fine but also close buy and sell conditions if (Bid &gt; Var1 ) Order = SIGNAL_CLOSEBUY; if ( Bid &lt; Var3 ) Order = SIGNAL_CLOSESELL; is this if no stoploss or tp is used or something more thnaks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Taking a look at where the USD/JPY is trading, I am only trading XXXX/JPY pairs from the long side in anticipation of intervention. Also, I am not trading any chf pairs at this time. Will let you know how this goes. This is in a live account. My reasoning as to the JPY is I think from now until Bernake's meeting in Jackson Hole I think the market may anticipate QE3, driving down the USD/JPY and causing intervention.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Dear Flame (please feel free to tell me to go to hell on this one) Ok i am testing my recovery system based on my ideas and bobs input and wondered if you could help modify the dash board to allow this more easily Recovery System A trade goes in dd by 100pips at that momment i hedge it (I obviously do this manually and have missed a couple so have 123, 111 being hedged at the moment.) The trade does its hedge untill it travels out of the bands (no mod required here just watch Out indicator on your dashboard) Once out of daily ma-lines set recovery ea4 on so as soon as it crosses back into ma bands it will add the new recovery trade- if all goes well and recovery makes up the 100pip deficit close all at BE or profit what ever basket is set at as per dashboard. My difficulty is 1) setting the hedge manually it would be great if auto option was available for this _but wondered if you could add hedge at x pips (this being a user defined variable you can set) 2) Also and this is asking a bit and out of the scope of the dashboard but it would be great if once outside mabands ea 4 recovery kicks in assuming hedge is on (This is more a request for Steve to consider in his EA design) If the first could be done it would be great if not well you don't get anything with out asking and at least i asked - Bob perhaps you could review this and add your 2 penny worht thnaks

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Today currently 22% Up yipee thats 44.3% up on £1,000 demo using 0.02 lot size (double what it should be as this was the default lot size on dashboard) in 2.5 days amazing 9.99% mon, 12.25% tue Drawdown a whopping 17% and have 3 hedged trades locked in at -100,-11, -123 pips each and one in recovery mode currently have 15pips back so effectivily -85 dd Lets see how my recovery works to see if this controlls dd better - I intend to close all trades Friday and will see what weekly fig is and start it a fresh Monday 1hr before London open Good luck all

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Is the dashboard posted in this thread or in another thread? I looked but did not see it here.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
The 4H EA and the 1H buy and sell EA but not the Both have a close when price hits the opposite BB band. Daily have no TP and the 1H Both has no TP. When I proposed these EAs I was not intending the 4H to be used in recovery but the 1H and 4H EA were mainly used for level 1 entries. Maybe I should take them out???

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Dashboard is posted in the 10.0 Trend.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
im finding the 1hr EA both takes me out at the other BB... this creates a problem when you are employing a recovery trade and it may be in DD and hits the other BB and you lose the position

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Bob, I have also traded all your systems started withe the 60*90 and have changed now to v10 after some pause from the ctr v5 since markets where unprediclable. Today I started with range v10 and all trades where against usd in dd now, that is bad luck, every time i start I have to recover. After reading all there is something i dont understand: You write that in h1 there is a better chance to recover faster because you het more good ctr trades but in range we should start l2 with the 4h ctr. Or do I mix something up? thanks bob and the other guys here !

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Just a question. At what level are you looking to recover? What lot sizes are you trading at what account size? The reason I am asking is because I have not found a need for recovery trades being initiated today. Is there some volatility? Yes, but that is more the norm than the exception to the rule lately.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Currently 21.3% up today that brings us to 65.63% increase in 3.5 days Ok the bad news dd is 19.65% and i have 5 in hedge mode ie 100 pips dd and now hedged to lock in dd awaiting recovery opportunity 2 in recovery 1 - 1.6pips+ 1 - 21+ pips in recovery so so far so good As i said come friday all will be clossed irrespective of position so a true week to week p/l can be shown i do not wish to carry over positions for the weekend or hegde everything and then open them up again monday. Take care

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I think that it is not the problem of when in pips but when I get a good ctr signal on a higher timeframe. I wanted to turn on the 4 h ctr now on audusd since its 80 pips in dd but i will wait till tomorrow. The other trades a some 20-60 pips in dd. today I had no winner but audnzd is positive. Since there is no tp when will the trade close or do we have to use mtpt, that is quote unclear for me? thanks

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi astral177 Would it be possible to share your MPTM setting file for this. Thanks in advance Marshy

--- 帖子 #69 ---
That is the 40 +30 MPTM in the folder. pg. 1 post 1

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Bob It feels like I have been reading your posts for the last month solid going over your older systems, as many have said thank you for sharing and the many other fantastic contributors. Can I ask a stupid question ? as far as I am aware with MT4 you can only put 1 EA on anyone pair, so as with astral77 using 1hr CTR both to open the trades on the pairs we want to, you then have the MPTM 40+30 left open and running to manage the other trades ?? so using the benefit of 2 EA`s one to open and one to manage. I have set up 2 demo accounts one for CTR and Trend look forward to contributing, only wish i could code. PS Also its amazing the difference it makes trading with smaller lot sizes

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi 1H CTR Both EA is loaded on individual charts to trigger trades. Mptm can be loaded on any chart and you can set it to manage ALL trades or some trades according to various criteria. You can have two different EAs on two charts of the same pair as long as they have different magic numbers so they know which trade belongs to which EA. However, this is not advisable since it may lead to complications. Having said that it is ok to have a EA plus mptm, since mptm is a trade management EA and does not trigger trades by itself. I hope this makes sense. Kind Regards

Great! Perhaps it should be more prominent in the docs, I counldt fint a hint about that, now it makes perfect sense. With all the AUD, NZD and CAd Pairs I have restricted to trade only in positive swap direction. Do you all do this also or it is a problem that over time will I have less trades what is not so good? thanks

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks for the reply, I was sure that was how it worked, getting ea`s to only manage different parts of the trade to avoid upsetting MT4

Astral77 Can you tell us which of the various trailing stops that are in the MPTM EA are using for you 10 pip setting?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
How is everyone getting along? So far the EA has been a dream. OK, during the last 36 hours the DD has shot up but it is still well within the acceptable range (less than 5%). It is very strange for me since I have been used to trading Bob`s system manually and now this fully automatic EA is doing all the work and I am a spectator. One thing that we have to be very careful is the recovery and hedge. Always bear in mind Bob`s golden rule "What goes up must come down". It is very tempting to start recovery at -100 pip and in all probability we will recover a lot of trades doing so. However, when we get a 600 or even 800 pip move without a decent retrace, then it becomes an account threatening martingale situation. So caution, practice and experience are of utmost importance. If or when we can truly master the art of recovery trading then we can enjoy very successful trading experience. Kind regards P.S. my latest set file for mptm is attached, mind you I will most probably switch to FLAME`s fantastic adaptation of phover dashboard to manage the trades.

Hi BOB I knew I had spoken too soon and Gods of forex frowned upon my arrogance!!! I have come across a feature of the system which may be a flaw in the EA. Please have a look at my results spread sheet, at the top of the list are the last 9 trades which were closed by the EA when the opposite signal and trade was triggered. (e.g. EURGBP long was closed and short opened, GBPAUD Short was closed and long opened, etc). As for EURAUD I have not got a clue what happened there since the -ve short was closed but a long was not triggered (please see the chart). The experts tab confirms that the EA closed these trades. The criminal I am using allows Hedging so it can not be due to no hedge rule. Have I done something MORONIC / IDIOTIC or this is the feature of the EA? The irony is that as these -ve trades were moving in +ve direction the opposite trade was entered and stopped the recovery of the original trade. Mind you I am not complaining since during the last few hours the floating dd was reduced significantly. Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The 1H EA does close when it reaches the opposite band. I have that in for my protection because i am away from my computer a lot and want the TP. I will post EAs without the Close this weekend using Steve's EAs with the one time entrance and you have to reset to work again. I originally didnt think of the situation where they would close as a negative because they had been running a while as DD. I will correct that and post the changes later. So yes that is how the EAs work. Sorry if I didnt make that clear enough in my booklets.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
its probably not a bad feature though as a risk minimisation (margin/DD) thing, especially when you are away from comp... plus it opens up another trade that more often then not will be positive.. ive had 4 or 5 trades do that past 36 hours and most of them are now positive for the second trade... small data set but yeh lots of small losses with more winners is a profitable system... and it means less situations employing recovery trades, also a bonus

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks very much BOB. Well the main point is that thus far it is very profitable and my motto is why fix it if it is not broke. The main disadvantage in one time entry is that then it may miss out on some trades. It is a dilemma. Kind Regards P.S. I just had a thought regarding this problem and I want to know what you think. For trades that go into by x pips we could reload the same EA but with a different magic number. This way if the EA is active if the opposite BB is hit and also it would act as a reentry for L2 as well.

ok guys i am now flat clossed all positions and what a week End position 54.3% up for the week on a 1,000 demo account -maximum drawdown reached 24% I am using .02 lot size as this was default in dashboard i am using curtousy of flame ammendements(thank you) My recovery stratgy has been as from tue afternoon to hedge at 100 pips and this has worked well. Jury is still out if a) Use recovery ea on recross of ma on daily (Higher risk particualrly if it crosses and reverses) I only entre at same lot size ie 0.02 so no increasing lot size and commpounding problems if it goes wrong b) Just hedge and match winners with losers as i feel apropriate low risk but it requires the premise that there will be far more winners than lossers which has been the case so far - Is this week typical who knows i will test again for a couple of more weeks and see if i want to go live after this. Great work bob a fantastic bit of thinking and development 54.3% up in one week amazing Can't wait for next week - will turn it on 1hr before london open take care and happy trading

Fantastic my friend, well done and keep up the good work. Bob`s system has been proven to be successful over two years of live account testing (please see Ver5 thread). However, the main problem we faced up to now was the floating DD. Scoobs told us some time ago as to what is acceptable DD for the professional traders and it was less than 5%. So we want to be in the same position as professionals. Indeed that is the main reason BOB created version 10. IMHO your capital to lot size ratio can be problematic. We have almost come to conclusion that for safe trading of this system for lot size of 10 cents you would need an account balance of $2000. At present the markets are very kind to the system and there is no problem, however, you should be ready when the markets are not as cooperative. Moreover, recovery which is Bob`s fantastic and unique invention is very subjective and requires plenty of practice, discretion and correct trader psychology. Unfortunately, over the last two years I have seen some very competent traders becoming unstuck on this and they left FF disappointed and disillusioned. This is a great shame because a number of them were much more experienced and competent than I. Therefore, I strongly urge anyone new to Bob`s system to go through his past posts and thoroughly read EVERYTHING he has written (which is quite extensive) on this subject. Believe me it will make hell of a lot of difference (i.e. between success and failure). Kind Regards

.02 maybe the default but that is two cents with a USA broker and 20 cents with many others. I would never trade live twenty cents per 1000 dollars but you maybe successful since you are able to hedge and probably have a higher margin than what we have, which we cannot do in the USA. I always thought a hedging system with this strategy would do very well but I am not able to do that here. So you will have to use your discretion. You could try .01 lots or 10 cents and play it safer, obviously 54% is great but it would be a risky strategy over the long term. I used to trade ten cents per thousand but the new margin requirements prevent me from doing so. Good luck. Also remember August is usually a very good range month but the news stories made it much more volatile than normal.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
OK another decent week. Increased the account 3.94% so that is very acceptable. I will increase my lot size by one penny starting Monday so instead of trading .03 and .05 I will go to .04 and .06 2nd level. Remember that is pennies not dimes make sure you all understand the difference on that. I am up 17.2% for the month from my original starting amount of funds. If you wish to figure percent of increase you take your starting balance lets say it is 1000 dollars. You increase it 172 dollars so your present balance is 1172. You compare your increase to the original balance so you take 172 and divide it by 1000 and you get .172 or 17.2%. 172/1000=0.172 That would be by the month. Lets say you wanted to do the last week and you made 50 dollars. You would take your balance of 1172 subtract 50 dollars to get your starting balance for the week which is 1122. So 50 divided by 1122 is 0.0445 or 4.45%. So that is how it is done. Account is up 17.2% for the month and 4.45% for the week. Now here is the exciting part. If you follow my formula of increasing lot size one penny every 200 dollars earned and you can average 20% a month. At the end of 1 year you have 8916.00 dollars in the account or a 791.6% increase of your account. Lets throw in a couple losing months so you average 10% a month (yes it will happen guys) you will have 3,138 dollars in your account or a 213.8% increase for you account. Now I believe that is slightly better than a bank.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
That is how I do all my recovery trades if I want to use the same EA. I just change the magic number. However, I have some trouble with the gbp/cad because I did that too often. gbp/cad is 62% of all my DD right now. So my DD is light but it is taking over 60% of it. I have had 2 successful trades off of that high resistance line this week but I wish that thing would come back down or I will have to close some of my losing trades to keep things from getting out of hand. Yeah I know, I know, if I followed my own rules I wouldnt be in this mess. LOL, dumb dumb.

As I keep reminding you SCHLOSSBERG says " DO AS I SAY AND NOT AS I DO". So in this regard you are with in distinguished company. I do hope this trade does work out for you. Personally I would not dare to touch this pair. Kind Regards P.s. Please go to Steve`s Big Bob thread and give us your opinion regarding the debate regarding Volatility.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
How often do you think trading pairs need to be re-assessed as to volatility ranking?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
When ever they break outside the norm. For example OCT. 2008 changed everything concerning volatility. The markets are far more volatile the last 3 years as compared to the 10 years before that. The eur/chf used to be one of the least volatile pairs, well now it is not since the Greek thing broke out last year. Eur/gbp has been a great non volatile pair but I think that will change if the Euro breaks up. aud/nzd used to be the best ranging pair until China started buying everything up it can find in Australia. Markets change, people keep predicting doom and gloom for the USA but it still remains the strongest economy in the world and against many currencies it has appreciated the last 3 years instead of spiraling into hyper-inflation. So these things can change and when they do we will change. Right now the Eur/usd is ranging nicely and giving me several good trades a week. That will end soon enough though/ I used to have this beautiful EA called the 100x40 which made me some good money but it is worthless now because of the volatility issue. 10.0, I hope, is my final answer to this volatile market.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
would you still use the AUDNZD/AUDCAD both ways (35x20) EA if you still could? my broker allows both ways and nano lots and 5 pip spread..

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Not the AUD/NZD, It used to bounce 30-60 pips up and down every 5-10 minutes and you could make a killing on it even with the 15-20 pip spreads back then. Now it moves more like normal currency pairs. Get China out of the way and you probably could. Aud/cad hmmmmmmmmmmm dont know havent looked at that one. maybe with the 10.0 sytem as a backup if things went bad you could. I looked at the chart on aud/cad and on 8-2 and 8-8 it would have gone outside the range of that EA. The run up in mid March to end of April would probably have done in that EA also. So you would have periods of recovery at times. Whether this would overcome its profits I dont know. I do know it doesnt bounce up and down like the aud/nzd used to do. That thing would spike 60 pips 2-5 times every hour and I would pick off the tops and bottoms. Best kept secret in Forex but it doesnt do that anymore. I did use it on the usd/sig (singapore dollar) successfully but that is no longer offered. USD/HKD might work too but I cant trade that one either. I tried the Danish Kroner ?? and Euro but the spread widens too much when it spikes for it to work. Any currency that is tied to another like the RMB is to the USD and is not free floating it would work. For example if we could do the RMB because it stays very stable and not move would probably be a big money maker if it was trade able.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here is a pic of an aud/nzd spike on a 5M chart. It used to do this several times an hour during busy times now it may only do it once or twice a day.

I will be initially using 0.01 per 1,000 when i go live and all trades hedges and that recovery ea placed on at 0.01 . 0.02 was an error as that was default and i left it as it was demo i will continue in demo like this for a few more weeks - if it works at this leaverage it should work with half it on live account. also demo is 1:100 leaverage and my live micro is 1:500 so this will give a bit more breathing space thank you for your guidence and input bob

--- 帖子 #92 ---
You ready for some strange news. If you traded one penny on 1000 dollars and did as well as I have this month you still would have increased your account 5%. If you went to an investment counselor and told him you could get 5% a month in Forex he probably would tell you at some point you will lose all your money because that has to be too risky of an investment.

Another week - Never loooked forward to the start of a week so much recently:- Well the pips keep coming - I have decided this week to purly focus on matching winners with any trades that go to -100 pips at the earlies opportunity . So trade hits -100 put on hedge and then match with next corresponding winners that = lossing trade. That has happened once today with GBPNZD -111 when i placed hedge this happened at 16-02 uk time and matched out at 16-51 Current position - + 13.14% today floating +2.51% Total since last Monday 67.54% up Great will keep demoing for another 2 weeks clossing all trades each friday 4-30ish uk time Good luck all

Hi all, I have been having some fun with this 1h CTR both CTR enters with sl 35pts trade then managed with MPTM BE 30pts 15pts profit then a jumping stop of 30pts 13 pairs its opened 14 trades today 8 closed with +135 and +125ish points still open. 1 lost trade so its aprox 1.75% up today . Might be a good idea if in the MPTM we could have an option to stop all trades if volatility gets too high or not open new trades ?? Thanks Bob

Morning all. I woke up this morning to see that USDJPY had opened about 115 sell trades and closed them pretty much straight away. I don't have the time to anylise it yet as I am getting ready for work. I am using the following settings : Trade opened with no SL Trade then managed with MPTM 25+10 BE 25pips 10pips profit then a jumping stop of 25pips after BE Hedging at -100 pips Total loss about $30 @ 0.01 Lots Be interesting to see if anybody else experienced the same problem Have a lovely day all.

Is your broker a 5 digit broker?? the MPTM maybe set on 4 digit broker. That would screw things up. Are you using my or SH EAs and maybe one of his is set wrong.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Good morning sir. I am using Pepperstone , a 5 digit ECN broker. I am using the version you supplied. It still had a trade on that pair running this morning which was in profit at the time. I cannot check it as my internet usage is limited here at work. Thank you.

really enjoying just using the 1hr CTR both ways EA. I think using that as a substitute for original 60x90 'idea' is working quite well for me atm. A couple of thoughts: - despite some people having problem when trades close when it hit the other BB at a loss, i think this is a good risk mitigation thing and often gets you back in the direction for a profitable trade on the next entry. You are getting more losing trades then just averaging and using recovery but the DD is SIGNIFICANTLY less I believe and the winners still outweigh the losers in both win % and pips. - an idea for adapting the EA for re-entries. Is it possible to set rules like price has to go 'x' amount of pips into drawdown from the first entry and also having the MA cross the BB (same entry rules) to reopen a second trade at a lot size that is 'x' multiplier. The rules on closing trades when hitting the other BB still apply for controlling risk. I think this would work well when you get price running up a BB, then it pauses and is say for eg 150pips in DD, then it spikes again to cross the BB then reverses in the direction of original entry. thoughts?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
which pairs are you using it on predominantley?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
im testing on pretty much all atm... when live i think its better to go the crosses/syntehtic pairs .. audnzd, audcad, eurcad, gbpcad, eurnzd, gbnzd, eurgbp etc

--- 帖子 #103 ---
IMO I don't think having recovery at x pips away from original entry is a good idea. I think Bob is steering away from this, hence the introduction of 10.0 recovery and waiting for price to cross back over the 2ma on daily. That way a price can run up the BB all it wants, but ea won't enter until 2ma is crossed.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
yeh thats what im saying, but if you have second reentry when MA crosses the BB, when it DOES runup the BB you could have 100's of entries... what im saying is for re-entries to be the same as the initial entry in criteria (1hr EA, MA high crosses BB) however price has to be for eg 100+ pips away from initial entry..

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hello, though I have studied booklets I am confused about proper using of EA for recovery. I use '10.0 1H CTR BOTH' on GBPUSD. Buy trade was sent some days ago. Yeasterday I decided to replace this EA by 10.0 DAILY RECOVERY after -125 pips expecting to send another buy trade but EA sent sell trade. Could someone advise how to use EA just for recovery?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I will explain to you what I do and use a current recovery of the EUR/CAD, which is being a bit difficult right now. The first point I will make is if you are going to trade this system make sure you are not over leveraging your account on the initial trade or having too many recovery positions open. Managing DD is a big part in making the system profitable. This pair can move 10,000 pips and I am still ok - not happy, but ok with my account. On to the trade, you will see on the below chart where my initial CTR trade entry, which was 1.3773 @ .03 (L1). After I took the trade in early August, you see the run up when commodities currencies really fell off. When it does this, the beauty about the recovery system is you just wait until it completes its run and begins to pull back to the blue line (2MA). The way the daily recovery EA works is it trades "outside - in" (OI) on the chart. So, when the price comes back to the blue line and touches, it enters, anticipating a move back to the red line or beyond. 6 days later my second (L2) trade enters at 1.4031 @ .05 (green circle) and does not retrace much and heads back up to the 1.4200 area. Now, one could look back and say why did you not take L2 at 1.4250? The issue there is you don't know if the run is over at that point. It could easily continued to 1.45, so the definition that the run is over is coming back to the blue line. It is tempting, but in my experience, an entry like that is purely a guess and usually ends up being a poor one. After the green circle, it is heading back up and 5 days later it gets to the purple circle. At that point it would have entered at around 1.4150 and again gives us a head fake and does not retrace much. The purple circle explains one of the rules I use in recovery, which is I like to see space of around 200 pips (at least), before taking another position. So, if I would have entered at that point, my breakeven point would not have been affected much for the retracement. Good thing I did not enter because it headed up higher. The last two days, I did have good spacing for L3, so I had the EA loaded and it just missed entry, which is ok with me, I will just wait. So, I am 18 days into this one, patiently waiting for the L3 level to enter and my current BE point is 1.3934 (L1 + L2). I will update you as this one progresses to show the next entry and completion of the recovery. If this one really starts to get nasty, I will also share at that time other strategies I have used in the past to aid in removing the DD. Keys with recovery is to be patient on the daily chart and keep good spacing on your L2 and L3 trades, waiting for Bob's golden rule to kick in - what goes up, must come down. Hope that helps. George

Hello George, thank you for explanation, logic of a trade sending seems to be clear. Recovery trade should be sent in the same direction as the first trade but my recovery trade was sent in opposite direction what is strange. If it would be sent in the same direction then both trades are closed on BE right now.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
You know I think you have really come up with a great idea on this hedging thing. At most I would only need to recover a 100 DD on any pair and if I am on the wrong side of a trade I can take the profit ride. This really intrigues me. Thanks for sharing. I may need to look for a foreign broker to try this out.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Peje, I am trying to understand your chart and not sure I am following it correctly, so I will interprete it based on some assumptions. Let me know if they are not correct. It looks like you had a BUY order first on the GBP/USD, which was well above the blue line, perhaps trying to re-enter the uptrend. The pair then drops down the to blue line (and you have the daily recovery EA on), once it touches the blue line, it looks like that is about the area which you have your sell order. If this is your scenario, then the EA performed correctly. With the daily recovery EA, it works outside-in, so (coming from the outside of the red and blue lines) the blue line creates a sell order and the red line sends a buy order. So, you are anticipating a move to go in between the red and blue lines for recovery. If I was in your position there, I would have looked to use probably the 4H CTR Buy EA to try and recover the trade, once it moved towards the -200 pip range. You are correct, if the L2 entered as a buy, judging from the candle, you would have been able to recover. Hope that helps... George

I am sorry for asking something totally moronic (I seem to have a late night mental block). But what is exactly censura`s hedge strategy ? As for broker which accepts US citizens!!! I heard some brokers like CMS accept US citizens (based in Bermuda). However, in my experience all good reputable ones are either in the USA or have close connections. Some Cyprus based ones do offer US citizens but you should read what scoobs says about them. Unfortunately, this brings me to the conclusion that you are better of with a big US broker (e.g. Oanda , ibfx, etc), using 2 accounts with the implications of needing more capital rather than go with some really despicable criminal just for the sake of 100:1 margin and the right to hedge. I know the implications are the need for much larger a/c balance but with the profits ver 10.0 is making at present the returns will still be quite reasonable. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I am based in the US and the above as listed by Astral77 is how I am set-up. I have one account which is for Trend trading. A second account which is for range/CTR. The pairs listed for each account do not cross over and are specific for the trading style. So, if I felt the need to hedge, an available pair in the other account is always available for that purpose. I have been fortunate enough that I don't hedge much at all to reduce DD with the 10.0 system. It is a pain sometimes switching between systems/brokers (I use two different brokers for the accounts), but it does provide good flexibility. Good trading to all.. George

--- 帖子 #113 ---
You can hedge with IBFX using two separate accounts. Their transfer from one account to another is pretty quick so it is possible. I just have not seen the need at this point to try it. Maybe some day I will, his strategy is similar to one I had in my head but he applies it differently.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Can you please explain your strategy of using the hedge trade and range trading....... Thanks, Prakash

--- 帖子 #115 ---
bump this.. thoughts bob? anyone know if this is difficult to code in?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
You can use the old martingale EA and just put in the number of pips. We used to set it at 200 reentry and go 3 levels deep. You can get that in the AUD/NZD thread and reset the numbers or we can post one for use.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi George, Thanks for this explanation. Although, I think I missed something very basic here - as far as I understood from nanningbob's booklets, the heart of 10.0 is that when the market changes behavior (based on daily chart) - we must change immediately our trading style to the new behavior. Meaning, if the market was ranging, but now switched to UT, we should stop range trading and start trend trading. it stated many times by nanningbob in his booklets. So my question is simple - as the euraud changed to UP, why trying to recover instead of closing the loosing trade, and switch to buy EA??

Put the same EA on the chart with a different magic number and change the pips. I do that all the time. OR have a second chart and run both EAs but each EA must have a different magic number. You could run the 1H CTR on one chart and the 4H CTR on another.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hello nanning..What would be your advise to people who don't want to use the EA but rather trade manually? Also can you confirm if I am following you clearly: After getting a confirmation from the daily chart (I only trade range, not trend), I go to the 1 hour chart and look for signals. (both stoch lines above-below the 90-10 lines, price hits outer BB bands). Then I enter the trade with 1 lot. If it goes against me 100 pips, I go to Level 2 with the same lot and same direction. Another 100 pips against me I enter my last lot which is 3. I know every detail is written but there is so much information I came to a point where I am confused. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Reentering every 100 pips is dangerous. A good run and you have some pretty stiff negatives to overcome. Better to use 200 or more, but 10.0 you reenter when it crosses back on the Daily thereby giving you a better chance without a run against you and getting better separation between trades. Yes you understand the 1.1.3 formula which is my favorite formula in recovery. However, if the distance is great between levels, then I might go 1,2,3 or 1,2,4 If you are going to manually trade then use some kind of warning system. It lets you know there is a cross in price so you can check on it.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
if i put another 1hr EA on the same chart with a different magic number ill still get the same entrance even if i change SL and TP (i assume this is what you mean by change the pips)... we cant always be at our computer on the 1hr to place an EA on for a 2nd entry...

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I think that depends on your trading style and whether or not you choose to use stop losses. Personally, I am a counter trend trader and I choose not to use SL's and recover. I am a below average trend trader and it comes difficult for me, however with the 10.0 philosophy I am working on improving that. That philosophy you mention above I follow prior to entry. Once I am in a trade, based on my selection of recovery vs. stop loss, it is BE or profit, then move on to the next set-up. (at least a very large percentage of the time). Let me show you what I have difficulty with on trend trading and applying what you suggested above. Below is the 1h chart of the EUR/CAD starting on Aug 3-10. So, there I am sitting at 1.3773 and the pair is just consolidating around that level. The green circle is where I was asleep at the wheel and for a brief moment this pair went 50 pips into profit. (probably one reason I need to test out MPTM, which I have not used in the past). Then, on August 4 at the blue box, you see where this pair takes off on a 400 pip run and the recovery process has begun. The area I really stuggled with these trending trades (after I was in and decided to change directions) is where do you enter and where do you put the stop loss and shift gears. I was very poor at this and a vast majority of the time, it would come back on me. So, it seemed like I was always on the wrong side of the trade. I am sure there are traders who are very good at this, combining it with fundamentals and get it right most of the time. I like Bob's method of looking at trend vs. counter trend, prior to entry and trading that way through exit. Also, you mentioned the buy EA after using the SL. It would not have entered during the uptrend of Aug 4, so you would have been looking at entering around the 1.4000 level on Aug 8, if the 1H Buy was used. I hope that makes sense.... Best of trading to you. George

Well, that indeed make sense, but I thing I still have to learn how I deal emotionally with different scenarios like you show. For now, I also wait for a pullback/recovery on the eurcad. Let's see what will happen... Thanks!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Yes Yes Yes. What you said above is correct! Thanks for the reply. I do like to note about some of your trading philosophy though. I couldnt agree more,you had said a profit banked in wouldnt hurt/keeps the bank at bay something like that? Breath in breath out comment? I had unconsciously used that very same thing you tought in about a 2 - 3 months experiment in a small account, guess what it,has grown &gt;20 percent since.Profits are banked in ,even in deep drawdown, what happened was when the prices kept trending the profit are banked in ,kinda hedged. Positions are reloaded(breath in ,breath out) and before long the drawdown disappeared. The price came back to close in overall profits! All that using micro/ nanolots using a single pair. I thought about your pdf's and manuals , it is about the same thing that i did! The idea must have merits after all. I just had to know the long term direction and thats it. In my opinion, the key that allowed the experiment to survive is to keep booking those profits and reloading position. Thats the crucial step to overcome drawdown during that period.Not forgetting diversification,multiple level/ trades even when trading 1 or 2 pairs. Note that I also did hedge both ways long/short so cannot use this in criminals brooker. Things that you said are not taught anywhere in the web, so i consider your philosophy ,ideas, thoughts as gold! even though i didnt trade your system it feels very similar.Very helpful and provided me with insight. You could even construct many systems using your ideas alone, its not that difficult but also simple. Thank you again,it feels like i had been reinforced knowing youre not alone trading this kind of stuffs.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sorry Censura but can you overview your trading method? I mean how are you trading? Trading times? Pairs? After you hedge at 100 pips what you do? You keep an eye on daily trend? It seems that i trade a method similar to yours, but im not having that big success.. Needless to say i'm totally newbie with hedging, recovering and trading with EAs, so that can be a good cause Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
more to that, if you are hedging at 100pips drawdown, when do you decide to release one of the 'legs'/trades? when criteria set up for another trade?

I tade NB10 ctr on 1hr timeframe as per NB rules and template I have a tp of 40 pips I have NO Stop Loss - (This will kill your account) I traded NB5 for 1 year and made money from it - My issue was always the scalling of positions level 2 , l3 etc 1.1.2.4 step When to get in to l2 l3 etc i tried MA 200, 500 i tried fixed 200 , 500 etc but could not decide on what was best and i didnt work for me After a lot of thought and trys i have decided on If a trade goes to -100 pips i place a counter trade to the same value (currently 0.02 lot size) to hedge / Fix my dd I then match out the losses ie the 2 pairs with winners eg On Monday i had GBPNZD go bad on me for -100 i hedged it fixed at about $18 loss i then waited until winners came along to close and match the trade i didnt have towait long here an hour later GBPCAD trade and CADJPY trade winners which gave me $18 profit so then clossed the GBPNZD 2 trades the first and the hedge. To my mind this is simple alot less risk and alot less worry. Obviously you need more winners than losers but the system is doing this. Cautionary Note - My account is over leaveraged (i explained this before) I had trades set at 0.02 by mistake rather than 0.01 this has meant at one point i was 24% in dd When i go live on 5th Sept i will use 0.01 lot size for each $1,000 , this would effectivly have halved my returns on my demo account which is what i am reporting on. Also the markets are ranging ok and i have not encountered a huge trend break out . My hope is that i can add an automatic hedge function into the ea bob had produced with variable hedge_at as a user defined parameter. I am not a coader so doing so learning to see if i can ammend the ctr to suit. (Obviously if there are coders out there who can do this great) Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Good strategy but my idea would be to hang onto the trade until you get the recovery cross of the 2MA. close the profit trade and counter with equal pips. 50 pips later the loss trade is breakeven. You then can ride it further to see if you can make a profit on the trade. In other words you are looking for a 50 pip retracement. I cant hedge so dont know, but I bet I could do it. Also you may really want to consider doing any buys on Euros. See article below, a bit sensational but the basic truth behind it does exist. http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;id=311347

Hi Bob. An observation. When using 10.0 H1 CTR BOTH on a H1 chart you definitely want to wacth out for extremely quiet periods lasting longer than 8-12 hours at a time. The BB narrows as a result and the trade could enter much sooner than you might expect. See attached. GBPUSD in the last 24 hrs. Best you can do here is suppose is remove the EA until volume returns... Any thoughts on that?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Today I decided to try out this hedging idea. I'm using mptm set to hedge at 100. Currently hedging gbp/cad. If price just stays where it is, I think I will match winners with losers and close out the trade. Otherwise if price runs I will wait for cross of the 2ma with buy/sell ea, then counter trade the 50 needed pips.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
This was my origional thought also but i found 2/3 trades i did this reveresed on me and compounded my losses. Now 2/3 is a very poor sample and i may come back to it later. Thanks Bob

Ok really thanks for the response! BTW.. just got an I.O. on the GBPCAD.. cool story!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
The EUR/CAD has come back and given us the L3 entry I have been waiting on and looks like a good day so far with a strong candle. So, the L3 entry was at 1.4231. As you can see from the chart, I have re-calculated my breakeven, which is now at 1.4080. Now we sit back and wait again to see if it can reach the BE level in the next couple days. I would not be surprised if the pair came back up to test the 1.4200 level before making the move to our BE point, since this has been a strong day. George

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Today was a difficult day i have had 6 x -100 hedge trades to close out with winners and thus the day stands at +1.63 % dd is 5,24% Total to date since Monday 22nd - 102.52% I have 1 more hedge to close out awating corresponding winners to allow me to do this. I try and do this as quickly as possible as there is the opportunity cost of having a pair fixed in a hedge ie i cant get any winners from it while it sits there. So was today a success ! i believe so as there are going to be 20% of the trading days when the mkt trends and if i can break even or even have to take a small loss it does not matter in the grand scheme of things take care and keep trading [/quote]

Hi Censura, Great trading results, can I ask how many pairs you trade, do you stick to Bobs suggestion of lower/medium volatility ? And also are you using the 1H CTR Both or manual entering on you trades Best of luck

Hello, What is your experience with MPTM 25+10? MPTM closes my recovery trade based on settings as it goes in my favour and let the first one in loss. Both trades together were far from BE. MPTM manages trades individualy even more position of a pair opened. How to manage recovery if I want to yous MPTM on other pairs?

hey guys could anyone help me amend the EA to allow for re-entries under the criteria i suggested before for the 1hr CTR both ways... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...39#post4904239

--- 帖子 #142 ---
You dont use MPTM for recovery trades. OR You set the MPTM to handle trades by magic number. So set all your 1st entry EAs to one magic number and use a MPTM for it set at that number. And then set your recovery trades at another magic number and set your MPTM to manage those EAs at that magic number. The code is below: extern string ManagementStyle="You can select more than one option"; extern bool ManageByMagicNumber=false; extern int MagicNumber=1; set to true and change magic number extern bool ManageByTradeComment=false; extern string TradeComment = "Fib"; extern bool ManageByTickeNumber=false; extern int TicketNumber; extern string OverRide="ManageThisPairOnly will override all previous"; extern string OverRide2="or can be used in combination with 1 of above"; extern bool ManageThisPairOnly=false; extern bool ManageSpecifiedPairs=false;//############## ADDED BY CACUS extern string PairsToManage="AUDJPY,AUDUSD,CHFJPY,EURCHF,EURGBP,EURJPY,EURUSD,GBPCHF,GBPJPY,GBPUSD,NZDJPY,NZDUSD,USDCHF,USDJPY";//############## ADDED BY CACUS // This allows the ea to manage all existing trades extern string OverRide1="ManageAllTrades will override all others"; extern bool ManageAllTrades=true; Set to False extern bool ManagingNanningbobTrades=false; When done making changes make sure you hit the compile button OR save with a new name and hit compile button.

ouch!! Today i was out most of the day and have had a few shocks on my return first the good news Today +21.84% so far dd 18.6% I have 11 hedge trades i have placed in the last 15min to hold them while i work out my clouser sequence. Most are way over 100pips which is a pain and an issue with my strategy as there is no auto hedge in the ea's so i have 3 over 200 pips in dd and 3 at around 160dd i have decided for the time being as an experiment to add IO recovery and see what happens - the last 2 weeks i have clossed all trades by now on friday but as this is a demo i will see how things go Total since Monday 22nd is still a massive 124.36% up so -18.6% floating is hardly the end of the world Take care all have a great weekend [/quote]

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Censura I have been using mptm to hedge at 100. It works well and you don't need to be at your computer. The trouble with hedging is when price moves 100 pips then hedge trade is taken, then price retraces back to original entry. So your left with original entry in profit and hedge trade at -100 or more. This happened to me on cad/jpy

--- 帖子 #146 ---
i got stuck in a gbptry long trade....now down 3% dd....(it's the real account....so no pennies here at all!! down 700pips...) hedged but hell...never try again to use this pair.....it moved 650 pips in less than a day!!well of course as soon as i hedged it moved up 140 pips....will try to unmount this mess next week...hope it will take a direction so that i can trade with bigger lots and wipe out the dd....have a nice we!!

Hi this is Bob trading my 12 non volatile pairs. I was up 3.1% for the week and ended up 22% for the month. Thursday and Friday really boosted my week after a very slow start. Except for the aud/chf run early in the month and the gbp/cad. I had little DD, stayed under 10% and mostly under 5% without those pairs. I decided to drop the aud/chf but the gbp/cad stayed with in its ranges so I will keep it. I have recovered almost 100% of the DD on it. I think I will just keep chugging along. anyway my equity curve for the week.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I really like the way this 1hr ctr rakes in the pips. It's a very active ea that takes full advantage of ranging times. I have found closing at market closing/opening times as Bob does to be very profitable. I have found more often than not the market retraces at the start of new session. Also using the sto, and the middle bb line for TP works well for me. I would not have made as much profit if I waited for price to reach opposite BB before closing. I like Bobs call of not trying to hit a home run on each trade, but rather take smaller profits more often.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thank you for reply. This is exactly what I start to do. MPTM manages just first trades based on magic number and I manually enter the same TP for first and recovery trade on BE plus small profit. This is what I expected from MPTM but there seems to be no solution for such case, possible basket trades but these are managed again based on magic number which is different for first and recovery trade so it is not usable as well as trade comment.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
it really does rake in the pips, im going live in the next 2 weeks with this system but I need to automate re-entries as atm i have to do it manually and often miss re-entries and the subsequent retrace while im asleep. ill be using 10 non volatile pairs and will trade 24/5 with 2 re-entries based on 1hr CTR where MA(high or low) cross BB but at a minimum distance between first entry (to avoid them opening heaps of entries on a BB run) for it to apply the re-entry. Using a multiplier of x1.3 can anyone help me code this into current ECN EA version???

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thought I would update the recovery of this pair as Thursday brought some decisions to consider and Friday was a roller coaster ride. The pair seems to still be defying gravity, but I like it and I believe this week might be the week to get move down to the BE point. So, I am in at 1.4231 with L3 and Thursday looks to be a good day moving my direction and my BE is at 1.4080. Below is the 1H chart to show the move and some decisions to consider. At the left of the chart you see the blue circle which shows some resistance around 1.4140. At that moment in time when we see the pair dropping to this range, there were two options (not including hedging or changing our direction, but remaining in recovery trend short). First, the L3 trade was profitable enough to BE with the L2 trade at 1.4045. So, we could have done that with the assumption the pair would not break 1.4140 to our BE point, then look to re-enter higher perhaps with the 1h CTR with an L2 trade and again raise our BE point without increasing our exposure. It is always nice to get the recovery on the first move, but sometimes you have to piece it together or wait a little longer. The only risk with this option is it does break 1.4140 and you have your L1 trade still there, where if you would have been patient you would be out. However, with removing L2 and L3 your overall risk / exposure is lower. Second, which for this example I chose to do, was just remain patient looking for the next couple days to continue back down to 1.4080. On the next chart, I will show you a couple reasons why I like the position. George

--- 帖子 #152 ---
The reason I chose to remain patient was two reasons. First, the EURO fundamentals I believe are to the downside. Second, the daily chart. If you look at the chart, to the upper left, it has serious resistance at the 1.4350 range. Actually, there is another candle you cannot see further to the left failing at 1.4350 as well. So, there is a nice ceiling there. If you see the green circle we have had 6 days of spinning tops and doji's which typically represents a reversal coming. This pair certainly can move above 1.4400 and if so, then some more creative strategies will need to be employed to remove DD, but I feel the probabilities are in our favor to hit 1.4080 before we close above 1.4400. If fundamentals where different or a stronger long term trend, then definitely would have taken option 1 from prior post and pieced this recovery together. Hope this is insightful for folks who have questions about recovery. Sometimes it is frustrating as it is with this pair... George

--- 帖子 #153 ---
The EUR/CAD today hit our BE target of 1.4080 and closed out the L1, L2 and L3 trades. I hope that example was helpful to those who had questions about recovery and how I use it. In summary, the recovery took 22 trading days to complete and that is where the daily chart helps you to be patient with your L2 and L3 trades. Also, the rule of "in the range of 200 pips or more" for the next position helps keep your L2 and L3 trades effective in raising your BE level. As you saw in the last post there are a few different ways to remove DD and decisions to make as price moves your way, however this was strictly by the book on waiting for it to return to the blue line for entries and just being patient. Best of trading to all... George

If anyone is using MPTM to manage their trades and are using hedging, can you PM me please? I am managing trades by Magic Number and the jumping stop is working great. However, the hedge trades that open are closing almost right away. I can hedge them manually, but for the life of me I can not figure out why the hedge trades opened by MPTM are closing almost right away.

Hi All I am currently writing a multi-pair trader for the 1Hr CTR EA's as I am having difficulty with the number of charts open on my laptop This is in testing so far but produces a screen similar to below:- I will upload it to the thread once testing is complete. I have taken the logic directly from the original 1h CTR ea's I have noticed though that the logic for Buy is MA Low below Lower Band and the Bid less than the Lower Band (reversed for sell), this causes orders to be opened when the price may be on a run in the opposite direction, ie. price is going down and hugging the bollinger lower band the EA will open a buy Have I just been unlucky in that all my testing I keep on hitting these runs and hence running up big losses (well not actual losses because I am hedging them at -100 pips to deal with later) Would it not make sense to have the logic for buy to be MA Low is ABOVE Lower Band and the previous MA Low was BELOW the Lower band - ie. to ensure that the price is at least going at least towards the Upper band or is it that these odd runs are compensated by the winners and the fact the original method gives a better price entry Regards, John

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Not a bad idea with the multi trader. Runs are a normal activity in Forex, there is no avoiding them. You choose to use hedging and stop losses, I choose to counter trade. I prefer counter trading and recovery trades. To each persons system are pluses and minuses. 10.0 was given to make recovery trades simpler and easier to do. I think hedging until the daily chart gives you the signal counter trade is a good idea. Hedging to wait until you have winners will have its drawbacks, I think, when the markets go trending this fall. You could have a news story that makes every trade hedge. You then dont have any pairs to profit yourself out of your hedges. However, if you wait for the counter trade you have less DD to deal with.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
This week was a closing out of my recovery trades. The market reversed almost across the board. I felt I was on the wrong end of several CHF trades so I just closed them for losses and recovery traded the rest. Still increased my account 1% this week and my DD is now under 2.5%. Looking forward to another week.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi John, I think the logic of the ea is great as is. I think long term the current ea logic will do better than changing the ma criteria for entrances. The last week or so have not been kind to this ea. But the 3 weeks before that, the ea made a killing. Often times your 20-30 pips in profit before the ma has risen above or below bb.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Cheers Frodog that is what I thought, as I said I have probably just been unlucky (last week seemed to be a bit of a nightmare anyway) I am finalizing some stuff on the Multipair and will be uploading shortly. One question for anyone -- the same EA is used for range and for re-entry into the trend - I am assuming that for re-entries into the main trend you would want for instance the MPTM to handle them differently as these are hopefully runners - does it make sense for the multipair to have 2 different magic numbers, one for when the direction is set at both (ie. true range) and one for when the direction is fixed one way (ie. countertrend / re-entry into a trend) Reason I am asking is that on the Multipair you can set the direction of trading, ie. both or buy/sell only I already have coded logic that when the direction is buy or sell only that it shouldn't close on the opposite band, this should only be done when the direction is both AND the flag is set to close on opposite band Regards, John

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Is there a manual version of this ?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Manual LOL have fun. When the 3MA high is above the BB on a 1H chart sell. When the 3MA low is below the BB on a 1H chart buy. Have fun staring at your screen all day so you dont miss your entrance.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Dear All As promised here is a “Multi-pair” trader for the 1H CTR expert advisor. The logic is taken directly from the standard 1H CTR Both There are 2 slight modifications to the standard logic, they are as follows 1) ECN brokers could not previously use the SL &amp; TP from this EA, and Steve’s EA had to be used or the SL/TP added via MPTM, this version will allow any broker to use the SL/TP features 2) The close on opposite band logic has been parametized, now the EA will only close on the opposite band if both of the following is true – the direction is set to Both, the Close on Opposite Band flag is set There is the ability to apply different magic numbers based on whether that pair is being used for range or for re-entry, if the currency pair is being used for Range (direction = both) then it will use the RangeMagicNbr, if the currency pair is being used for Re-Entry (direction = buy or sell) then it will use the ReEntryMagicNbr. Although by default I have set them both to 100 as I wasn’t exactly sure if this was needed. The EA uses several “buttons”, in all cases to “press” these pseudo “buttons” to change the state, highlight the “button” and drag it from its default position. The EA has 2 separate levels of control:- Main control – this is controlled by the “button” start/stop at the top of the screen, if the EA is stopped using this “button” then the EA will do absolutely nothing (mainly used if you need to change some parameters via F7) as the EA runs on a continuous loop and does not require ticks to run (apart from the first tick) Pair control – each pair can be individually controlled (the pair name is the “button”), if the pair is in red, then the EA will NOT perform any order management or entry processing (it will still show open orders &amp; profit/loss). If the pair is in lime, then the EA will perform order management and entry processing. Each pair can be set up to trade in both directions, or buy / sell only, to change the direction “press” the direction “button”, it will cycle through in the following order (BOTH -&gt; Buy -&gt; Sell -&gt; BOTH). For safety either ensure that the MA’s are within the Bollinger Bands (so no unexpected trades are opened) or use the pair control “button” to temporarily suspend the pair. By default the EA will start with ALL currency pairs temporarily suspended with a direction of BOTH. The current definition (UT,DT,BO,CTR) of the pairs "trend" is also displayed. If there is an open order, the order will be displayed along with it’s current Profit / Loss For the tinkerers around, the screen definition (placement of fields, font, colors etc) are setup in the “#define” section at the top of the EA. Changing the values here will automatically modify the screen setup. Refer to NB’s documentation on changing EA’s for assistance if required. Any questions, please do this via PM to avoid this thread being cluttered with technical queries not related to the method. Regards, John

hey mate is it possible to code for re-entries something that allows for re-entires on the same criteria as the entries (moving average high crosses over bollinger band and vice versa) but to avoid have 1000's of re-entries on a bollinger band run set a minimum distance between first entry and re-entries for the criteria for re-entry to take effect thanks great work on the modification

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi I take it you mean something like recovery, although I am not an expert on this I thought recovery was handled by looking for the MA2 cross on the daily and using the recovery EA there is however two different work-arounds already coded into the EA to handle this Work Around 1 a) temporarily suspend the pair (move the pair "button" so it is red) b) Create a global variable using F3 with a prefix = to the #define IgnorePfx, the default is "Z@Ignore #" after the # sign you put in the ticket number of the original trade (eg. Z@Ignore #123432250) c) if you have done this correctly the trade will now disappear from the dashboard d) when you think that the run is nearly over (or it has moved enough pips) stop the pair suspension (move the pair "button" so it is lime) e) the ea will then open a trade if the criteria is still met Work Around 2 a) Ensure that you have 2 different magic numbers for the Range &amp; Re-Entry b) Temporarily suspend the pair c) Change the direction from the one that created the original entry (so if originally was both and a buy order entered, change the direction to buy, if originally on buy and a buy order entered, change to both etc.) d) when you think that the run is nearly over (or it has moved enough pips) stop the pair suspension (move the pair "button" so it is lime) e) the ea will then open a trade if the criteria is still met not a perfect solution I know, but I was also looking at ways for the EA to ignore the fact that it already had an opened trade - but this would be in extra special circumstances and wasn't intended to be used on a regular basis Regards, John

Can the latest NH4 panel be used for hedging? I couldn't see anything in the pdf. At the moment I use mptm, but this takes a bit to manage when you close the loser and counter trade, you have to make sure mptm doesn't re-enter a hedge as soon as you close the looser. I have it set as "manage these pairs only" and just before I close a hedge trade, I have to make sure the pair is not on the "manage these pairs only" list.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Frodog not sure if this will be helpful to you at all (probably not as you are using the GUI with MPTM to hedge) but I am creating another version of this multipair trader with the ability to hedge. My idea is to use MPTM purely for the trailing part and have the hedging as part of the core EA Although in the end my ideal situation would be to have the more advanced logic for trailing that is available in MPTM directly available in the multipair trader. Regards, John

im currently doing this with two different magic number EA's the problem is on heavily ranging pairs like AUDNZD is have the re-entries quite close and during the night i miss a lot of re-entries because of sleep. Trading AUDNZD or AUDCAD on shorter term time frames as a range method (exactly like 1hr both ways EA) works very well in terms of risk to return but im having trouble getting the coding to live test the EA.... i prefer re-entries/recovery's on small timeframes exactly as the intial entry, not MA crosses, but thats my preference

Heck if I know here is the code if you want to double check your EA. Does anyone see something wrong?? double Var1 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 20, 1, 0, PRICE_CLOSE, MODE_UPPER, Current + 0);//PAIR, PERIOD, MA period, Deviation, shift double Var2 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 20, 2, 0, PRICE_CLOSE, MODE_UPPER, Current + 0); double Var3 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 20, 1, 0, PRICE_CLOSE, MODE_LOWER, Current + 0); double Var4 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 20, 2, 0, PRICE_CLOSE, MODE_LOWER, Current + 0); double Var5 = iMA(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 3, 1, MODE_LWMA, PRICE_OPEN, Current + 0); if ( Var5 &lt; Var3 &amp;&amp; Bid &lt; Var3 ) Order = SIGNAL_BUY;//VAR3 is the lower band if ( Var5 &gt; Var1 &amp;&amp; Bid &gt; Var1 ) Order = SIGNAL_SELL;//Var1 is the upper band

now that was an interesting few minutes on the EUR/CHF. The ea I''ve set up on the non volitile pairs did take some losses in the panic but it now has some trades in profit as well. It will be intersting to see how this day pans out. Good luck everyone!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hy, I played around with the 1h ctr both EA. I put them up on the charts that you suggested on pst. 1. Actually I put up 2 of every chart with different magic numbers and they were managed by 2 mptms to test different TPs. The problem is that my account got wiped out. The problem was with CHF/JPY. It opend 12 (24 on both charts) long trades while it was falling off the cliff. I would like to know if this happend to other people or the problem is on my side?

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/dryc...-w-mptm/160394 Here is CTR BOTH running with MPTM untouchd since Fri not bad if DD shrinks

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Grats on those results! what MPTM settings are you using?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Here are my results with the CTR 1H Both EA. I sorted them by pair to show the huge differences between them. I have MPTM set to go to breakeven at 45 +30 and also a jumping stop after breakeven. I take profit when I think a move has stalled but perhaps I should let trades run for longer since my overall results aren't great. Any suggestions are welcome!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I am still chugging along here. The problem with my results now is it includes some trades from trend trading so that helps my over all total. Trend trades are done at .02 and CTR trades are done at .04. From Sept. 1 until today my account has increase 6.8% which is very solid my DD is low with chf/jpy and nzd/chf providing most of it. It just keeps bouncing up and down and collecting pips. If I take out my trend trades my increase would be around 3% for one week which is very acceptable. I will continue to pick and choose my trend trades and keep the CTR going full tilt. I am not using an MPTM at this time.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Bob, say you have a trade that goes 100 against you and then retraces 50 and hits the opposite bb, will you allow the ea to close the trade for a loss of 50 odd pips when it hits opposite bb, or will you shut the ea down and set a manual tp at be?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
The 1 Hour needs to be manually closed and I only use the BB close on the 4H first level. I will close a 2nd or 3rd level trade for profit and keep the 1 L loser to play with at a later date. I especially do this when I think price will range instead of giving a full retrace. So often my recovery trades are multiples instead of singles. On the other hand if I know I am just on the wrong end of a trade I will take anything close to a BE. So if I am 300 down at .2 lots and my .4 lot retraces 75 pips (other side of BB band) I will just take the acceptable loss especially if other trades that day make it even.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Bob, When in recovery do you use 10.0 recovery for L2,L3 trades off the daily chart 100% of the time. I know you don't always go for full recovery on first attempt, but do you always re-enter l2,3 off the daily 2ma?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I will also use the 4H CTR or reset the 1H CTR with new magic number to play the bounce off the highs when price action warrants it. But most of my reentries are OI EA on the daily.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Bob, would you recommend this course of action as per attached ea? I have this hedged and would need a 50 pip retrace to BE. Or I could just close the buy trade and enter a new sell off the ctr ea.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
For me to even think I could get a 50 pip retrace on a EURO pair would be tough. A 50 pip loss is very acceptable with any Euro buy trade right now. You can sit on it until the Greek thing resolves itself or just take the loss. I would be hesitant to try to recover. At any moment Germany could say NO MORE and watch that thing drop like a rock, or Greece say NO MORE or France credit downgrade or ................... I think you get the picture. Anyone of those scenarios could drop the EURO very quickly. However, if I were to try such a thing I would do it during the jpy session where I have a very good chance that price would not run on me if it didn't succeed. If you had a BB bottom on a lower chart like 1H, 30M, etc and try to run it to the top during off hours would be the best bet.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Despite sitting on 4 recovery trades for now NZD/CHF, CHF/JPY, GBP/USD and AUD/CAD I have been plugging along all month. It was definitely a slower week but still managed some profit. The problem with reporting is I trade all forms of my 10.0 system on one account. So I will report two numbers. All trades I increased my account since Sept. 1 11.1% The pairs just using the 1H CTR is 5.5% . My win to loss ratio since Aug. 1 when I started using 10.0 for all my trading is 80.2% which is over a 10% increase over my previous trading experience with my other systems from a 1 year period. So so far I am very pleased with the results both increase in my account and win to loss ratio. I also would note that I decreased my lot sizes a penny or two on trades with the breakout of the Greek/Euro stories last week. I wanted to be prepared for anything that could happen. So my results would have been higher if I had kept my same sizes but my DD would also have been bigger. dropping my lot sizes a tad allows me to keep my DD around the 10% figure. Almost all of that is involved in the 4 currencies mentioned above. I have done well shorting the EURO but my old habits of grabbing profit when it appears is limiting making a killing there but cant complain. 10.0 is working out very well. The big jump around the 70th trade was the gbp/chf trade I caught luckily. Cleared out some DD towards the end of the week by taking profit to clean out losses. I accidentally closed a trade I did not want to close for a loss. I accidentally closed the loss instead of the profit trade so I have that dip there. I have one piece of 10.0 left and that is the 4H system. I have been testing a different version of it and the results are far better than the one posted. One more week of testing a tweek I did yesterday on it and it will be ready to post. At that point the complete 10.0 series will be available. To my fellow 4H traders, I think it will be a killer system and is testing out to be the most profitable of the 10.0 trading systems. I will be calling it counter-trading back into the trend. It is mixing the sell high buy low system with 10.0 and CTR, so far it rocks. I am finding out that I am still a 4H counter trader at heart. It is still where I am most experienced at trading.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I am really appreciate you

Bob,YOU rock! Your enthusiasm never wanes!! Congrats on your latest systems...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
1st of all: thank you for this wonderful trading guide. I won't call it system or EA, because its more to my than just a list of a few steps to follow. 2nd: might by stupid - i'm not very experienced with mt4 for now, but could you please explain (or post a set file to play with) how to do you set up a strategy tester? I would like to play with small changes and see how they work, but i really cant work out a starting point... Today ive been trying to play with Steves BigBob EA - with no results (exlicitly now trades fires) which is probably due to a bad configuration i made. Thank you very much Bob. I read the 10.0 posts and i'm really impressed with your attitude toward sharing knowledge. Cheers from Poland.

Here is my current g/c recovery. As you can see ctr took the 1st level right at the start of the DT. I then hedged at 100 pips. After PA steadied, I thought I would close the hedge and counter off the 1h ctr. As you can see PA decided to go downhill again...PA then touched the 2ma which indicated reversal or range time. At this point I decided to counter off the 4h ctr. PA then decided to go downhill again...So this is where I'm currently at. This got me thinking, maybe it would be better to just stick to 10.0 recovery instead of trying different methods of recovery ie. ctr 1 or 4h.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I use 10.0 exclusively for recovery now. When I post my 4H system for counter trading it will be an excellent recovery tool also. So you will then have 2 tools for recovery. I will try to post it as soon as my tweaks show they are working properly. It will help you in this trade. Dont feel bad I am 900+ down on chf/jpy but only 1 level. waiting for the daily to give me that counter trend signal which is did two days ago. PA has been very thin though so my new 4H counter trade system will get its best test there. If I can counter trade 1000 pips down the trading world is at my finger tips. Will try to post that soon. To encourage you go to the weekly G/C chart and you will see it travels from its high to its low and back all the time. It is a very range bound pair so be patient. My trade last month that went almost 800 pips down, eventually the first level came back and profited but I had to wait it out a month. So take a look at the weekly and plan your trade around it with 10.0. I think you will like what you see.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Bob, About the Nb 10.0 trading system EA, I brief summary like following table, please help to confirm my concept definition was right! and I found following another EA that I confused when time to adopt, please give me a guide. 10.0 4H CTR BOTH B 10.0 4H CTR BUY B 10.0 4H CTR BUY B these EA logic major specific difference on : //+----------------------------------------------------+ //| Signal Begin(Entry) | //+----------------------------------------------------+ if ( Var5 &lt; Var3 &amp;&amp; Bid &lt; Var3 ) Order = SIGNAL_BUY; if ( Var5 &gt; Var1 &amp;&amp; Bid &gt; Var1 ) Order = SIGNAL_SELL;

--- 帖子 #197 ---
You got it except use the 4H B on the 4H chart. It solves entry problems that were happening with the first 4H EA. I do not use the 4H but the 4H B. You will get some bad entrances with the first 4H ea so always use 4H B. Nice organized summary of the system. Good job and good explanation.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Change the all the 4H ea to 4H B and post on the trend thread, I think they will like it. I will probably use this in my next update if you dont mind.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Dear Bob, I just study your booklet and brief summary the EA, so please re use as you need or want, I upload the source file if you need to do any modification.

Would just like to subscribe to it

Dear bob, I have confused about when we open a order then the trend go against for us, we could do which action to response, I think the scenario table like follwing , please help to clarify the response action be right or have another option to do

--- 帖子 #202 ---
You wait until the low breaks the blue line when blue is above the red or the high breaks the blue line when blue is below the red line on the daily chart. That signals the run is over most of the time and it is safe to range trade, counter trade, or reversal of trend. If the fundamentals are strong these are the dips in an uptrend or a rally in a downtrend. For example the fundamentals are strong against the EURO right now so I wont do buys on it. So when the high breaks the blue I play a rally in a downtrend. So I will do sells on the Euro. I will continue to do this until the Euro settles on its debt issues. I wish I knew the fundamental on the pound right now other than it is being dragged down with the Euro. I have also settled on doing only sells on the pound also. Looks nice every 4-8 hours pocketing those profits. Still on the wrong side of the gbp/usd however.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Bob, Thanks so much for your time and generosity that you put into sharing this system. I've been following a few weeks and starting to slowly get my head around it. May I ask, are you just setting the 1hr reenter sell EA and letting it run in this case? Many thanks again

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Depending where price is sitting I will use my IO ea on the daily or the 1H sell. I am also using my new 4H sell EA system which I will post this weekend. It seems to be working fine and will take more trades than the present 4H EA I have posted. I also had a buy going and trying to recover on the gbp/usd but now consider that futility for the near future. I took out half of the DD today on the gbp/usd using my profits for the week. I will try to take the rest out later. One of the things I am doing is reducing the lot size so if the original lot is .03 or .04 I will reduce it down to .02. If I ever get a recovery trade it will then be simpler to wipe out. I was late in realizing that the pound planned exit out of their mess is to inflate the heck out of the pound. They are pursuing this policy more heavily than any other country right now and it is succeeding. So this is one of those times I just feel to get out rather than trying to fight a recovery. I will continue to try to recover my CHF trades but my pound buys I am going to drop with each profit I take until its gone. Probably end the week with my first negative or zero growth week since starting 10.0. The fundamentals are really looking ugly with the GBP right now. I was so focused on the EURO I missed this one.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Well this will certainly test 10.0. I am currently at about 55% DD. Currently 7700 pips in DD . I recovered from that g/c trade I posted earlier after using profits to close L1 and then PA had a nice run up to BE for L2/3. I couldn't just get out earlier for all current trades because PA dropped so quickly. If I had just got out it would of taken out months of profit. I am just patiently waiting for 10.0 to do it's thing.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
WOW 55% that is trouble. I am around 22% and have started closing trades here and there to keep it down. I will close trades once i get over 20% and deal with it later. I am glad I had taken out over 1/2 half of the gbp/usd or that would have been trouble. It is still manageable at this point. The good news is JPY is thinking of intervening in the markets so I am hoping that will take care of NZD/JPY and CHF/JPY next week. GBP/USD still concerns me so I think I will use profits to close more of that one out. We have the USD coming up as a safe place for funds if the economy goes bad to worse and the GBP wanting to depreciate the heck out of the pound. So thats a double whammy there. China is reporting a slow down for the third straight month which will crash the AUD and NZD if it continues. Lots of ugly news out there to screw up range trading. I am hoping my idea of just the least volatile pairs will work during these bad times. 10.0 recovery will get a severe test. If it survives this then it will survive anything. Economic collapse world wide or very sever economic damage is a possibility.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I am able to hedge. Would you suggest hedging certain trades at double lot size? My current positions in big DD are: chf/jpy buy eur/gbp sell (not too worried about this) nzd/jpy buy usd/cad sell gbp/usd buy cad/jpy buy aud/usd buy aud/jpy buy aud/cad buy

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I will talk about some of these trades on my 4H sight tonight. When I post my 4H counter trading back into the trend. All JPY dont hedge, BOJ is probably going to do a major intervention soon, hopefully this week. AUD that is a yucky call since China's economy is slowing down. JPY because of bank intervention, GBP because they are printing pounds like crazy, aud/cad fellow commodity currency should have the same problem so they should bounce up and down consistantly, aud/usd will probably need a hedge if you cant counter out of it. It is #1 on my list to use profit to get out of. Talk more tonight in the 4H thread.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi Bob, Do the templates have any effect on the EAs, or are they just to make it easier to see what's going on? I.e, can we use any template with any EA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #210 ---
In case Bob is busy I can answer this one. For NB systems you can use any template you like and or you can customize the existing templates. With some EAs which use a particular customized indicator then you need to have that indicator on your chart in order for the EAs to function properly. As far as I am aware non of Bob`s EAs need a customized indicator to function. Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #211 ---
The EAs and templates do not interact. The templates only try to show what the EAs should be doiing.

Since most of the trades are now in recovery I have spent most of my time in the 4H CT section. Doesnt mean I havent stopped range trading the 1H. Ok my trades and how they are going. Except for the AUD/NZD and USD/JPY. All the trades are in some form of recovery. I will list the pair, total negative pips all levels, when the 1L trade started and percentage of recovery so far since the 1L trade started. I also may make some comments on some of the pairs. It doesnt mean I have been losing all month I only am reporting since the trade went into recovery. My overall increase in my account for all 10.0 trades is 13.3%. Most of my recovery trades I am using the CT 4H system and some OI on the daily chart. Anyway here is range trading as of this weekend. aud/cad -310 since 9-9 recovered 57% so far. Not too worried about this pair since they are both commidity economies. If commodities go down they both will and this causes them to bounce around consistantly. aud/jpy -494 since 9-19 recovered 30%. China economy slowdown brings the aud down, BOJ desire to bring down the jpy. Let the bouncing begin. aud/nzd -75 this has been my best trading pair the last two months. Very reliable bouncing pair. Probably should just trade this and leave the rest. aud/usd -1637 9-9 recovered 18% Now that reports of Chinese economy in slow down and USD strengthening that is a double whammy. I am making this pair my #1 priority of getting out of. This trade is nothing but trouble right now. The one redeeming quality is China has been buying some AUD. So hopefully see a retrace and out. If you are not into this pair I would consider only sells on it for now. cad/jpy -629 9-19 recovered 11% I am expecting BOJ to step in at some point and stop the jpy from further strengthening. Will wait this one out.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
eur/gbp -161 9-23 recovered 0 This has just started and mainly from Friday's move. Will look for a retrace trade sometime next week. gbp/cad -303 9-28 recovered 0 I will put a trade at the peak here for a nice sell. This is as high as it gets. Just look at the weekly or monthly chart. So will manually enter a sell on Monday. gbp/usd -1037 9-1 recovered 60% after a 5 week dive looks like the gbp is finally retracing. I made this a priority last week and even though my pips DD looks big I only have .01 lot left on the -700 negative trade. So I will use normal recovery to eliminate the rest this week. Comment on GBP. This thing is all over the place. gbp/usd is diving, gbp/cad is flying and the gbp/chf is floating like nothing is happening. eur/gbp is ranging but did a dive Friday. So most euros went up but not with the gbp. Go figure. nzd/chf-194 9-6 recovered 116.2% One of the bright spots for the month along with the aud/nzd. Already BE and making profit again with this one. nzd/jpy -1100 recovered 11% This pair likes to break out and then range, breakout and then range. So with this range time we will bring this back to BE soon. usd/cad -767 recovered 5% Watch out for this one. The USD is such a powerhouse currency and the CAD such a small one it can get crushed with strong USD moves. This is one pair I will just eat a loss rather than try to recover. Major resistance area coming up on the weekly and monthly charts. If it breaks that area I will just take the loss. I have learned the hard way too many times not to get caught in USD power moves with the CAD. USD/JPY I will only do buys with this pair for now. JPY wants to weaken its currency and the USD is on a strong move. SO why fight it. Do buys in the dips. Final comments: concentrate on eliminating DD on the usd/cad and the aud/usd. Use your profits to clean things up.

So the drawdown is around 6700 pips to the most experimented person here. I guess many (most of) accounts blowed up already. That is the reason is so quiet in the last couple days. I want to see where this s going, because I want to go live, and need to know whats the best amount I should start with. I guess this is the worst case scenario

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I appreciate this thread is todo with range trading but you need to be very careful when trading some of these currency pairs because the underlying trend can blow your accounts. As NB has stated USDCAD can be a killer when the USD moves, also, by my calculations the following is one reason why you can be stuck with DD even though you may think you are in a range trade. AUD Trend -4 (out of 7 pairs supported by Alpari UK) CAD Trend -3 (out of 6 pairs supported by Alpari UK) CHF Trend -4 (out of 6 pairs supported by Alpari UK) EUR Trend +1 (out of 7 pairs supported by Alpari UK) GBP Trend +3 (out of 7 pairs supported by Alpari UK) JPY Trend +6 (out of 7 pairs supported by Alpari UK) NZD Trend -5 (out of 5 pairs supported by Alpari UK) USD Trend +6 (out of 7 pairs supported by Alpari UK) Scoobs

We are experiencing some of the biggest moves in Forex since Oct. 2008. The pairs I chose were the ones that range the best but of course there can be problems. My DD is under 25% which means I need to add funds or drop some trades. Also dont forget I have also posted a 13% increase over the month. I could close out all the bad trades and still post a profit but at this point I dont see a need except for the aud/usd and cad/usd. If I do that I want it on my Oct. sheet and see if I can overcome and still make OCT. profitable. Friday had a big run up, I suspect re-tracement Monday and Tuesday from that. Either way I will close out some of those losers with some of my profit Monday and get my DD back under control. The key is making sure you have a plan on how you want to exit. Both the cad and aud depend on the major S/R spots they are at on the monthly chart. If they break those spots then obviously I dont want to deal with recovery and will just take the loss. Then I will take all month and try to get it back.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I like to study the forex overall trading knowledge and concept from bob, not like common manual strategy system just teach me sell when indicator cross down and then buy on indicator cross up... , As bob sayed: "The key is making sure you have a plan on how you want to exit". these are I want to study from bob and I think these was the factor that could survive long term on forex trading . I am demo testing Stev EA from long time ago, but I still not live trading these EA now, because some time the Stev EA will caused big DD, then I don't know how to handle it that I should let EA to continue recovery or let EA to hedge the order,I have not any idea or system could help me to do judgement, so I study the Bob system and expect to manual intervention the EA for recovery and hedge behavior. if I could do the plan myself how to exit then I will trading Stev EA on live. thanks you bob, all of your post, I copy and paste in my note. and I am a Chinese and I know you like Chinese people

I made my choices for today. I took out part of my aud/usd and chf/jpy trades today. 1.1% of my account. This brings my DD down over 2%. I will reassess tomorrow what other steps I will take to lower more of my DD. I want to see if some of my CT trades will take some profit today. Going to bed now.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Frodog, That sounds great! Which pair were you trading?? Cheers for sharing

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Starlogic, I was trading the same pairs as Bob (low volatile) Things have gone really downhill for me. I traded my account from $2500 up to $3600 over 3 or 4 months trading .02 standard lots. BUT....after the recent trending my account took a fatal hit... my equity is now at about $300 I found that because most pairs are so correlated they almost all move in the same direction. A couple of key things I learnt from this is: .02 standard lots for my account size was too big for the amount of pairs I was trading (12 pairs) DO NOT let your account go over 20%DD. Close out trades when this happens, so DD comes back down. At the moment my balance is $1300 so i'm just going to recover these last trades I have and then probably withdraw my $$

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Here i bragged about you to others. The dd hits do come in range trading it is just how you deal with it. Since I trade small I get through these patches. Like I said in my recovery I used about half of my Sept. profit to take out some trades. Things are under control for now. If there is another run I do have some room again. To me if 10.0 Range trading survives these moves then I think I finally found a range system that works just using an EA and you interfere with recovery. Anyway it appears that 1 penny per 500 of account seems to be a safe number to trade with. I only went over 20% of my account because of trades outside this system. The chf/jpy is going to take some time to recover but the rest are very doable. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
The secret to this range system is the dd control which i know is stating the obvious. You will always have winners from this system but the trick is to make sure the runs dont kill you. I introduced sometime ago my hedge at 100 system it has saved me and i have continued to post gains throught the two months (since aug 12th) i posted results for a while but stopped as i felt it had no use apart from my ego. Since Aug 12th my account has grown by 187% my drawdown has never been over 24% (This was when i did not catch the hedge in time as it is not a auto (still awating this via phover new panel) I have evolved my system as before i hedged and either matched lossers with winners as and when (the best method as it frees up those pairs to trade again- the issue with hedging is obviously it takes those pairs out of the game) Now if the pair looks like a bb runner and using other indicators related to volume spread analysis (VSA) i place my second trade with the trend - i am also considering doing this automatically. or if it is seperated from the bb then i await the retrace using the recovery ea I never compound my trades ie using the traditional 1,1,2,4 or other lot increase , i understand it but effectivley each trade is still a risk and if it goes against me i am further in the do do . So i stick to my base lot size. Also if i have not enough winners to offset then i generally wait and will pick off trades 1 at a time controlling my dd using some fundemenatals as a guide. It is not set and forgett so it has a lot of descretion in it. My point is (and i borrowed this from another thred basket trading) i see it as a business with stock controll, cashflow and profit/loss and if i have say 9 or 10 in hedge (which has happened ) i am not going to get the sam volume of winners so it can take time to match them out and take decsions 1 at a time - occassionally i will wipe the slate clean particualrly friday at 4-30 uk time and start again at 5am UK time (alot of my losses have happened sunday/monday so i have stopped trading at these times. Also i will stopp/ hedge everything if real major news is coming and wait till things settle. (This is range trading and i dont want to be the wrong side of a currency going of on a big run particualrly if i am not watching to hedge) So just thought i would add my 2 penny worth this dd mng is a study in its own right and i think it will take me sometime to get to grips with it but nb has given me a platform and though process. The best tactic for me is the hedge means each pair is never to far out to put you in problems especially if you are patience and here is another key- you can trade all your life , every weekday is a trading day, but your account need protecting it is your lifeline and the mkt does not care about it so you must. take care

When the markets are trending yes, when they are not, no. Markets tend to range more than trend so it seems to me ranging profits more often. DD right now is a headache but before that ranging EA was knocking down profit for months while trend trading was frustrating.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
censura, you hedge at -100 pips: what is the rush to close out these 2 trades - price might come back to -50 in a couple of days/weeks and you close out the trades without a loss. in the meantime your loss wont get any larger than -100 on the 2 trades anyway. when hedged you say you cannot trade in that pair: why not, after all that trade is hedged? just trying to understand and thank you for your reply

--- 帖子 #228 ---
When you want to undo a hedge wait until the 10.0 system gives you the ranging period and then take out one hedge at the high and the other at the low. This way you are out with out a loss.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
yep NB, that might be a more clever way to do it .......but anyway, in my opinion there is no rush to close out the hedge and take a 100 pip loss without trying for a better outcome I think. I leave the floor to the professionals

The purpose of a hedge is to stop time. The trade that was going against you is stopped in time until you get a market in your favor. It is an account saver if a sudden story comes. I was furious that they stopped hedging in the USA. That was my backup plan to a super bad trade. Now I use smaller lots so I can use a bigger ranger in trading. I always know a market I like will eventually happen.

You are tangling against quite the expert. I really dont trust a person who pisses on others in the field. Now he is after the bank traders and brokerage houses. I mean who does that leave beside himself. I just dont trust people like that. Anyway welcome, to range trading.

Digging myself out of a hole here but getting out. I am glad I down sized my lot size at the end of September or I would have had to add funds. Not because of the pairs here but some other trades I took. Anyway, still in recovery aud/cad, aud/jpy, chf/jpy, cad/jap, gbp/usd, nzd/jpy, usd/cad Most of them I am close to clearing out. Some are reduced in lot sizes so they are not that deep money wise anymore. These pairs I am back to normal trading with the Range EA aud/nzd (probably the best pair to trade) aud/usd this one I just took some losses on cleaned out 1st and 2nd levels last week. Could have hung in there but I didnt want to violate my 20% rule. When over 20% DD start clearing out trades or add funds. Then next DD I experience I may make a new rule where if I go over 15% DD all profits must be used to clear DD. I have a tendency to keep pocking profits and letting DD get bigger. If I had done that with a couple of trades I might not have had to close any big losers. Any way will try that one. I have dropped aud/usd from my list, I think pairing that small of a pair with a major like USD will always lead to trouble some where. eur/gb p this one held steady all the way through. gbp/ca d another good customer with some exciting moments at times. nzd/chf DANG SNB still it came back and cleaned itself out. usd/jpy wish this one would move just a little more. The range pairs did as advertised stayed within a range during a big run. CHF bank interference made it more exciting than it should be.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
As some of you saw in my recovery thread I took a 7% hit to get my account below 20% DD mark. Since then I have reduced that deficit by 25% So I am down 5.25% for the month. If I can get another solid week I will be back close to 0 and maybe eek out a profitable month. I have not had a losing month in a long time and I thought it might be this month but we will see. The good news is if I can eke out a profit month in a month bad for range trading then I would be excited about that. So keep plugging away.

Bob, It seems to me the single most important question you can ask before you take a trade is "Is this a trending or a ranging market". If it is a ranging market you should make one trade. And if it is a trending market you should the opposite. How do you decide which is which?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Go to 10.0 Trend trading. It is all in the booklets.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Checking out your method in more detail. Always though your stuff was too complicated in the past but now it makes more sense. Alot to go through but so far so good.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Bob, Forgive me if I missed it... sometimes things are hiding in plain sight... but I couldn't find the precise definition of a range or how to move between a range system and a trend system. I did look at your work so I know that you trend trade up when price on a daily chart closes above the two moving averages and you trend trade down when it closes below.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Definition of a range trade is when the Low or high is touching any of the two lines on the daily chart. Price is trending when the low and high are not touching any of the lines on a daily chart.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
got it. So you have trend up, trend down, range. It seem range is a very danger position to be in because with the Euro it is not ranging , but moving between an up trend or down. I'll have to give it a bit more thought. As for the lion's den...you are doing a good job of turning wild animals into teddy bears.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Bob, I am going through your past posts, finding things I see as interesting, and commenting on them. I hope you don't mind. Let me know if this starts to clog things up. I see your method as very similar to that of the business model of a clothing store. You buy your clothes, put them out for sale. You only sell when you have a profit and since you are not using a stoploss, you never sell for a loss. At seasons end you have accumulated "Junk" inventory. You dump this at a loss and move onto the next season of clothing. This system works because the net profit during peak season counteracts losses from the season end sales. With this metaphor, your DD is really the cost of maintaining a stock of goods in your store. I find the metaphor of interest does not work that well for me because for me the central fact of interest is not that it increases your balance, but that it makes your account grow in geometrically.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Well said. the one central difference between the forex market and all other markets is the extreme leverage that is being used. This leverage really benefits two people. 1. the broker. a 2 pip commission at 100:1 leverage means 100X profit. 2. bankers. Bankers need liquidity to function. If retail traders go out there with 1:1 leverage the volume would be so small that it would make no difference to them. Also, with low leverage, forex is no where near as exciting. And that would also reduce the number of players. Double whammy.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Is this just based on experience or have you done some detailed analysis like you have done with the behavior of currency pairs.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
wow dude. you just don't stop with the misinformation do you? firstly, leverage is not limited to the forex market. google CFD and get some education. secondly, retail leverage doesn't make a lick of difference to the liquidity in the market when most retail muppets are trading with bucket shops. if your orders never see the light of day in the real market then HOW CAN YOUR ORDERS MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO LIQUIDITY? seriously dude... just stop.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Correct me if I am wrong, but this looks like a bit of fundamental analysis. I am not being argumentative, but the key thing I am working on at the moment is the relationship between technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Do you ever use fundamental analysis with your trades?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
% I am now in the process of setting up an account to trade the RMB or USD/CNY as it is called. The key factor I am looking at is the swap. Since the currency pair is stable the 6.5 overnight rate of the CNY becomes very attractive. Also, long term, it is hard to imagine this pair breaking 7.0. So downside risk, while it exists, is very small. In a 10 year window, breaking 5.0 is much more likely. At 6:1 leverage, the overnight rate works out to about 20% return per year. The 5 percent appreciation this year would have packed another 30% return. The possibility that it will rise to 7.0 is small, but it does exist. However, the Chinese government is a big fan of stability. It does not like to surprise its people with the "unexpected". So you will have a lot of advanced warning. Not relevant, but hopefully you will find it interesting.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I am struggling with this logic... can you clarify?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Traders usually trade less in August. I think retail sales maybe lower but dont know. My experience has been Sept., Oct. and November are the 3 wildest months of the year but that can change with the news. So any analysis can be thrown in the trash if news get violent.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
The only news or fundamentals I am concerned with are ones that significantly move the market over a period of time. 1 week to months. Daily news means nothing to me per se. Interest Rate changes, economies slowing or speeding up, sovereign debt, earthquakes, major bank interventions, are ones that have interrupted range trading. Most of what you read in the news is not effective. USA down grade didnt affect the market for very long. Knowing Euro debt problems, I gave the warning to only sell the Euro and not get involved in buys. So the big front page ones are the most critical.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I wish it was on the open market, it would a perfect range trade currency pair.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
one penny per thousand would be equivalent to trading 1:1 leverage even if your account is set up for higher leverage.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Just ignore nubcake that stuff is for the other thread. We range trade here whether he likes it or not.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Nub. Can't say I am happy to see you, but it is NB's thread so whatever he is comfortable with, I will respect. I have two points: 1. Leverage exists in all markets, but the extreme leverage of 500:1 or 100:1 or even 50:1 does not exist in most markets. 2. That some retail trades never see the light of day does not mean that no retail trade sees the light of day. At least three types of retail trades make it to the interbank market: 1. the large ones, 2. the successful ones and 3. when the trades at a broke become unbalanced, brokers hedge their risk.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
range trading is some peoples bread and butter, so no issue with range trading. my issue was, is, and always will be, misinformation / lies / categorically wrong statements. it's like some stuff is being picked and chosen to suit a perspective because it seems relevant, except that the stuff isn't even true to begin with. anyway, i have no interest in this thread. i only noticed it on the active threads list and happened to see the garden path getting followed as usual. adios.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Thanks. This is exactly what i do. It seems you can gain a very meaningful edge from looking at the big picture. The details though, are more noise than anything. The S&amp;P downgrade was noise, though louder than most. It changed nothing that I would call fundamental. The US still borrowed to pay its bills, American consumption and production patterns did not change and the net supply of USD did not change one bit.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
ok i'll bite on this one because it's not completely bonkers... 1. perhaps. however, just because forex is leveraged so high doesn't mean a thing except that the price movements are so small that it requires the position to be leveraged for the miniscule movements to equate to anything. it's like, if eur/usd was actually sitting at $120.39 and the spread was $0.01 and the pip size was $0.01 you probably wouldn't have much leverage used on this pair if any at all by anyone. you can probably open positions with what you make in a few weeks wage and actually have it return (or lose) a real amount of money because of the granularity of pip movements..... but the reality is something different. the reality is that the pip size is actually $0.0001 with a spread around that to 2x that. you aren't going to get anywhere waiting for price to tick up 1c without opening a huge position, and if you don't have the money to actually do this then you rely on leverage and margin instead. what it's NOT like is if eur/usd was trading at $1.0001 and the spread was $0.01. then you'd be a crazy to bother leveraging a position based on this. all that matters is tick size and spread size. all movement thereafter and leveraging of said movement is purely a function of the tick size and spread. as for your point number 2.... so if one does not leverage their trades they are not going to be making much money unless they are starting with a mountain of capital in the first place. so, you think that no trader gets into trading with a grub stake, uses leverage, builds a nice bankroll and starts trading size that puts them into ECN and actually affecting liquidity? i'm sure there are some people who jump straight in with their daddy's oil fortunes propping them up, but i do not believe that the majority of retail traders who are actually a part of the market liquidity all come from rich backgrounds and instead actually had to build their capital from a grub stake.... and so i'd love to know how you do that without using leverage! the conclusion to this is that from what you are suggesting you either start with enough capital to not be leveraged yet still be in the real market trading real volume with size, or you start with a small stake and not be leveraged and so will never see the real market and will always be small fry due to never accumulating a bankroll that supports large trading volume that would put you out of bucket shops and onto an ecn. you aren't ever going to get kicked out of a bucket shop trading nano lots, despite however big your account is.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Nub, Your points are reasonable, but NB has asked that we focus on either range trading or his systems here. SL &amp; leverage will fit quite nicely into that mad house where we first met. If you wish to cut &amp; past into that forum, I will respond there.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi Bob, can you tell me why this would not work? Some traders in the US are annoyed about not being able to hedge. I have an idea that effectively does the exact same thing. Censura hedges at 100 and recovers later and this is considered a good strategy, effectively limiting DD. Why not just set a 100 pip SL using a trade once 1hctr ea. When the stop gets hit, just wait and re-enter when the daily chart indicates a ranging market. This is what would be done with a hedge anyway (close the winner and re-enter in the original direction) The trick when using a SL would be to re-enter at a larger lot size just as you effectively would be with a hedge trade. Hedge example: Buy 1 lot. Trade goes -100 so 1 lot sell hedge trade is taken. Close winner and re-enter 1 lot in original direction using OI recovery ea. TP 50 pips to BE. Exit trade. SL example: Buy 1 lot. Trade goes -100 and hits SL. Set OI recovery ea at 2 lots with 50 pip TP. Once TP is hit, exit trade. To me the outcome and risk of these examples are the same. The SL example would also save you swaps waiting for recovery ea to enter. Can you tell me how my reasoning is flawed?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
In other words take 100 pip SL and then pretend you are recovering the SL. Interesting concept. I dont know the percentage of trades that may go 100+ pips down but then retrace and later make a profit. In other words I never have to make it up with a different trade. A different trade would mean I have a whole different set of parameters to meet to make a trade. I do know one thing the win percentage would go down and you would face having to have bigger wins to over come the 100 SL. So let us say your average win is 40 pips. You now need 2.5 wins for every loss just to break even. That is what I had to do before I started range trading or CT trading. You can try but I never could make it work. The two formulas that seem to work for traders is: lots of small stops and have some big winners OR lots of winners that overcome the occasional losers. Something in between I have never seen work. The only way to really tell is to test it out for a month and see how you do.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
exactly... you use a stop, so you get stopped out and then price goes where you needed. you don't use a stop, price someday goes on a runner hurting your account. but.... if you can understand the concept of re-entering after a stop is hit instead of nedging, then you can understand why nedging is a joke to begin with since it IS closing trades. it doesn't pause anything, ever! a sell closes a buy, and a buy closes a sell........ nedging is nothing more than a mindgame. welcome to the jungle.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
For example there is this guying trying to get me to use his method of trading. The first trade I took I set up a pending sell just below a major support line. Price breaks support and goes down. Price moved to the exact point, took the trade and then shot back up above the line and headed for the SL. In other words I have to deal with the computer programming within MT4 dealers that are designed to take trades close to moves or SL or account margin calls, widening margins as price moves to TP line, etc. again. To me those are the things that make trading so hard, the odds are so stacked against you.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
My example was if you had a predetermined amount of pips lost before a hedge trade ie 100. If you hedge at 100 and price retraces back to original trade, your still left with the hedge. Exact same as using a stop, then price retracing. If you don't have a predetermined amount of negative pips before hedging (fundamentals) well that would be a different strategy. But I think if your strategy is to hedge at a set amount of pips every time, it may be easier just to use a stop, and enter the next trade as a recovery trade.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
you get bob's system better than he does himself. props to you. and you explained it well.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
NB, I played around with something that I called "return to sender" a few months back. Key idea is that once price moves 15 pips off of open price, it returns to that open price more likely than not. Basic contrarian trade. I used 4 opens and 1 close. Japan open, Frankfurt open, London open, US open, London close. My success rate was just about 90% if I used a 105 pip stoploss. If I used no stoploss, then typically only 3-4 trades did not return to the open/close price within the month. This worked well on the euro/usd and the gbp/usd. I added a pyramid function. At -30 pips I added a position, at -45 another at -60 yet another. Lot size was determined at 10% risk... if I lost all four trades, then it I would lose 10% of my account. With the stoploss I would typically double my account most months. But a couple of the months I would get badly clipped by a volatile market. Determining lot size as a percentage of account meant that you would never get a margin call, but if your trades went against you it might approach zero. I tried to manage this with hedging, but found that any mechanical rule I followed created as many problems as it solved. If price movement was clean, then I won. But more often than not, price movement would move on both sides of the -105 pip line, sometimes as many as 50 times. Over time, the spreads became a concern, and the losses (say 10 pips or so) an even greater concern. I though this system was too dangerous to trade live, and couldn't find a practical way to use the hedge.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Except you are ignoring the fact that we are trading ranging pairs here and they range very well. We have argued these points in another thread. Anyone is free to go there and argue these points.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
the point was not about stops... it was about nedging. hence why the last thing i was talking about was nedging.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
You are range trading and the range is too tight. Any move outside the range destroys the concept, moves that stay inside work great. The key to hedging is knowing when to unhedge it. You can not undo a hedge in a trending market. You have to wait for a ranging market to unhedge it. Unless you have a specific unhedging plan, hedging doesnt work or is extremely difficult to do. Until 10.0 and having a definition of a ranging market I didnt have a good plan to unhedge a hedge except to take my profits from other trades to BE. Now I have an area I can undo the hedge. Once you get into a ranging market, close one at the high and the other at the low. That cleans out the hedge go back to trading and you avoided a very bad trade.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
The concept of recovery trading is If a trade is 100 pips down and I put a recovery trade on I only need 50 pips to break even. Even smaller if i go a little bigger lot ( do not double that is dangerous). In a SL you need to regain the full 100 pips in recovery you only need 50 that is the big advantage of recovery versus SL. That is why your win percentage is higher and why it is easier to overcome DD instead of SL。

--- 帖子 #270 ---
you are completely blind to the point of what he is saying. forget the fact that he ever.... ever... said stop loss. just focus on what he is saying about nedging. you talk about hedging (nedging) to pause trades... have a think about what frodog has just said. then think about what you are doing when you nedge. when it clicks you'll see clearer than ever before.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
it seems that the key advantage of hedging is psychological, not mathematical. If you like ranging markets, you get caught in a trending market, and you hate taking a loss, then you can hedge until you get back to the trending market. But some people will end up paying a high psychological price -- more positions to worry about and a continued sense of something not being resolved. There is an actual monetary cost to hedging, but it is very small. It is the swap. With two positions open, you will always lose a little on the swap. You may have the spread on an additional position to pay for, but that depends on your subsequent strategy. IMHO the decision to hedge should be based on "what is better for me" instead of "what is better". One key edge in forex is to to align your strategy with your psychological make up, not against. The actual cost of the hedge -- the swap-- is pretty close to irrelevant to most short term or medium term trades.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
If you use a stop at 100pips and then reenter at the same lot size you will need 100pips to BE. If you use a stop and then reenter at the same lot size the hedge would of been, you would then only need 50 pips to BE. When closing a hedge you then reenter in the original direction, thus increasing original lot size. If a stop was used, and you reentered at the equivalant hedge lot size, you would still BE at 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I have a theory of hedging and had a hedging demo trades going before the USA changed. The great part is I could trade with much larger lot sizes and my gains were quite large. I didnt need to watch fundamentals. I just needed to do a buy and a sell. When the USA market was done and prices were ranging I took out the profit at its high or low and let the other retrace and with a CT trade. The size of the CT trade was dependent on the move for the day. Dang that worked well. Was kind of fun to do. Used the 4H high low to get out and trading time was just a few minutes a day.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Sorry Nubcake but you are the first person I ever have banned from my threads. You dont have anything to contribute to this thread. I am sorry you are so brain locked you dont comprehend anything else but your little world. People come here for alternatives not to be bashed every time they say something.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Why don't you just change brokers? I belive Dukascopy allows hedging and allows American customers to play by European rules, provided they are not resident in the US.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes, that is the understanding. 50 pips is easier to recovery than 100. The key is to reenter with some kind of skill. The bigger the DD the more CT trades you need to over come but you never have to recover the same distance back to 0. One of the things I am learning is I tried to recover using one or two trades. Now I am using smaller profit trades and reducing the DD lot size a piece at a time. The benefit of this is the margin usage goes down even though price may have just stalled somewhere. If a stop was used you would need to double the lot size to BE at 50.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
My experience with foreign brokers has not been good. One changed their swaps in the middle of a DD and ate up my profit in 3 weeks. I mean it was big. Another actually ran the price below 0 to get my margin to hit, computer program thing went out of control. I was going to publish pictures all over the net and FF but they gave me my money back to keep quiet. On top of that the cost of moving money form a foreign country to home is expensive. So I have not found one to my liking yet.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I am not here to promote brokers. But Dukascopy seems to be one of the few brokers that nobody hates. I don't have an account because you have to actually mail in documents to open your account.

Dear bob, I am interesting your hedging theory, could you share to us. many FF trader not live in USA.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
me too

--- 帖子 #282 ---
With a short explanation here with the aud/usd. Let us say you have a hedge going. At area 1 is when ranging period would begin. You would try to pick a low and high to release the 2 hedges. See 1A to 1B in second chart. To eliminate 100 pip hedge in this 250 pip retracement. This one would be difficult to read and pick up but it shows it possible. release one near the bottom S line and release the other near the top R line. If that didnt work then on to area 2. You have a 5 day ranging period here.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Area 2 on this chart is a much bigger area and gives a 350 space to unhedge over 3 days. What is nice about this one is a high and low is established before ranging begins.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Area 3 is a straight reversal into the new trend so that would be hard to unload here. Not a good range but then life is like that sometimes. But that is the theory behind it. Wait for a time when you can unload off of a high low point on a lower chart. I am sure top to bottom BB bands would work also. It is just a matter of catch some kind of low and high to do it in and the range period in 10.0 would be your best explanation.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hey everyone so been running it this week and must say in 24 hours it is up already 23 pips locked in with 180 pips in the running, cannot believe it was this successful overnight. Will be testing for the next month to get the hang of it before I go live. Will also post the link to myfxbook later so you can all see the trades.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Thanks Bob. I get the impression that this might be difficult to do if you don't have the experience. How much do you rely on purely technical indicators? Do you ever use "feel" to decide that market conditions have changed from trend to range?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Yes I think there is a feel for the market. The best thing to use would be the 4H high low because that would give you the range to expect. So if the pips between the high and low are 75 you can capture 40-50 of the pips. You can do the math from there. The problem is since I cant hedge I dont have the practical experience to go with theory. I do have the practical CT trade but not the other. The problem with hedging is not the strategy it is the getting out. The other strategy would be to hold the hedge until you have enough winners to delete it, then you can wipe it out.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thanks Bob. For now I think I will stay away from hedges. I have enough trouble trying to figure out what positions I currently have open and closed. Despite the worst possible market for my system, I have closed out a couple thousand pips in the last couple of weeks and well over 100 positions. I couldn't imagine having to keep track of hedges on top of everything. My success rate is almost 100%, and my account balance is up 5%. So much for the SL crowd. When you use your system how much do you interfer with your EA's? Do you take the attitude of the scientist or the parent?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I only use EAs to enter. Some of my 4H ones have a tp built in but they are seldom hit (a problem I will deal with this weekend.) I usually take profit at a S/R spot and then set the EA up for another entrance. I take profit sometime into a session. 2-3 hours into JPY, 3-4 hours into the Euro and 3-4 hours into the USA session. Sometimes there is something before the jpy open. I like to grab profit before it retraces back into oblivion. Sometimes I miss the big move but most of the time I get the profit and later get a reentry for another.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I do something similar. I manually set my entries, but have a tendency to close them before I hit the TP. I actually see this as a bad thing. 80% of the time the price actually ends up at the TP, and so I am short changing myself. this really adds up. Over time it works out to about 40% less profit. I see this as a personal failing. My entries are clever, but my exits are driven by fear. But then again, I have not done a proper analysis losses I avoided by exiting too early.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
My view of hedging is an emergency stop the action. It freezes time and allows me to think of what I want to do next. It is a breather. I can walk away for 2 weeks if I want to and come back later. Under pressure you can make some really bad decisions. With it you can think it through exactly what you want to do. It gives you time to make a solid plan and also research how you got into the mess in the first place.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Yeah, I passed on this advice to another fellow just 2 days ago. Key value of a hedge is psychological. Key cost is also psychological. And the key issue in whether to use one or not is who you are as a person.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
NB, An US broker to do both buy and sell orders in 1 pair is Interactive Brokers, although I think you have to deposit $ 10,000 to open an account. Although who will check that when you tell them that you will deposit the required deposit or higher, but actually deposit less?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
You can hedge with IBFX also but you need two accounts and they will transfer money from one to the other quickly. Still you can margin out if you trade too big because you are using twice the margin with two trades going. Anyway for now I am happy with what I am doing here. I probably am going to whittle down the number of pairs I use and then increase lot size to get a better return with less risk. I think I could trade .05 or .06 with 6-8 pairs so I am researching now which ones I want to use.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
just the 1 account with IB am curious which pairs you will settle on............... why not try to have the 8 main currencies presented equally. so 4 or 8 pairs. in that way none is overpresented and causing major problems if 1 currency takes off.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
My decision is based more on volatility than over representation but I want to cut out and go smaller with range trading. When you see what I am cooking up in my Trend trading section you will know why. I want more pairs available for that and just let the real consistant range pairs for range trading. So far the best 4 have been gbp/cad, aud/nzd, eur/gbp, and usd/jpy. The other 4 I will wait and see. Maybe the NZD/JPY. I may just go with those 4 or 5 and use bigger lot sizes. That uses all 7 currencies and only the gbp is used twice. If I add the NZD/JPY then gbp, nzd, and jpy are used twice. No CHF. dang thing has been my biggest headache the last two years.

NB, dont know how you calculate the volatility of a pair, but I look at the difference between high and low of the last year as a percentage of the low. the best pairs are usd/cad 7.4%, gbp/cad 7.5%, usd/hkd 7.9%, eur/cad 8.2%, gbp/usd 9.3%, eur/gbp 9.6%, aud/cad 9.6%, usd/sgd 10.5%, eur/aud 10.9%, aud/nzd 12%, usd/jpy 12.6%. however to look back for a year might be too long, because markets do change quickly. another way could be to look at the daily ATR for the last month as a percentage of price and trade the ones with the lowest for the next month. suppose a daily ATR of 120 pips in a pair priced at 0.60 is twice as volatile as 120 pips in a pair priced at 1.20.......... how do you do the process NB? now CHF is aligned to the EUR would that make a difference in the volatility?

If this story is true get ready to sell the Euro again: http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011...n-failure.html I will again take the position of only doing sells on the Euro. It will be interesting to see if SNB will be able to hold the line on the euro/chf. My guess it wont but I wouldnt trust my guess. In my 10.0 trend I posted a BO system I think would work very well in the upcoming market so I would seriously look at that or any other breakout system you are comfortable with. I do not recommend range trading or CT trading during this upcoming possible super news story. If you find yourself on the wrong end of a trade you would be better off closing it than trying to ride it out. I have no idea how a 50% or greater loss on Greek debt will play out. I do have my guesses and they would be. Sell the euro, probably also the gbp. Chf I wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole, SNB could do anything. USD probably be the currency of choice to appreciate and probably also the JPY. Commodity currencies Cad, NZD, AUD, I dont know but whatever direction they start to run they probably will run in that direction for a while. For those of you who know more about fundamentals please post your thoughts. Thank you.

Well the EU will keep saying the same thing about having some plan to restore stability which i think is pure crap. But the Fed is pretty much stating today that they will pursue QE3 which will I think push the USD up a bit and this can be seen with how well the US markets are doing today. But this will be a crazy week for markets not sure where they will end up. I have my demo account still running just because I want to leave that as untouched as I can, so I have the CTR 1H Both and CTR 4H Both, running right now on demos. And they still seem to be handling today alright, no big issues there right now. Will keep everyone posted.

I think the best trading situation will be the 10.1 BO. You can just watch it BO from those lines and follow the trend. Range trading has made me some good money over the years but the super news story is its weakness. When you understand the weakness of a trading system then you can stay out of trouble.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hey everyone here is the link to my 4H CTR demo on FXCM http://www.fxstat.com/performances/v..._CTR_Both-7922 Has been doing pretty good so far, running on GBPCAD, AUDNZD, EURGBP, and USDJPY.

OK I had my first losing month this year but I got my recovery. The concept of using all my profit at the 15% mark to reduce DD worked very well. Much better than waiting until 20% DD and taking losses. You will see by my chart where I took losses at 20% and then I used profits to reduce DD above 15%. I kept doing this until my DD was under 10% and then I started pocketing profits again. So if you look at the chart you see where my equity line stayed level and then when my target of 10% was reached I continued taking profits and letting break evens with each pair take care of itself. During this process I kept using the same lot size instead of increasing it. So if I had 3 lot on a pair I would reduce it to 2 but my countertrade was 3. This way I kept my DD down by not not increasing my lot size but still getting the larger lot to reduce my smaller lot. This worked very well once I got the hang of it. See pic below.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Since I started using 10.0 Aug. 1 I have had a 26% increase of my account. At present I am not doing range trading because of the volatility of the markets. I am doing very well with 4H CTR and 4H high/low EAs. I also am trading the 10.1 BO from the trend trading system. Here is my equity curve since Aug. 1.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Dear NB First thanks. Following your 3 threads, updating EAs, indicators and templates I got to the point where I have to set up my MT4 account from scratch, but I am rather confused about what to actually use. Do I happen to find myself in a transition phase and do I simply have to wait some time till the new system is consolidated?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I set up three different trading systems for different people and styles. You need to choose one that fits you and trade. For example are you a trend trader, counter trader or range trader? To try to learn all three would be difficult. Choose the one you would like to do and learn it. The guys who report consistent profits are usually are doing just one of the systems.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I have to say running the 4H CTR on just these four pairs has been less profitable than the 1H CTR on the same pairs but my draw down has been almost none. Im debating if the higher draw down is worth the higher profits.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
That is how it was designed to work. I find the 4H CTR useful in recovery for that very reason. When it takes a trade it is quite solid and that is what you need in recovery is a good solid trade.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hi bob, i found myself pretty confident with a little mod of this ea: istead of buying and selling directly when ma low or high exit the bb, i set that as a condition and then it waits for a turn. example: sell when ma high exceeds bb high in the current or the previous candle AND price is below or equal the previous low. in this way u totally avoid runners and enter the trade only when price moves in the right direction! i backtested it and found that even if u enter a couple aff pips lower in selling or higher in buying, u rarely incurr in runners or at least u enter in a better position because price has to movo higher (before buying) or lower (before selling)... just my 2 pips (i dealed with somme runners using this ea...) ps. consider the "anti intervention mod" triggering ctr trades only when atr1 M1&lt;atr60 M1 as explained by scooby!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
It sounds like a very good idea to me. Everything I have in these EAs and trading systems are compilation of ideas I have picked up from others. Live test it and let me know how it does. Filtering is always the ultimate goal the better the filters the better long term trading will go. Good job.

Anyone who is practicing NB recovery or thinking of trading NB recovery trades, must read this post by Scooby a professional (recently retired) trader who has proven his status to many of us time and time again. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...34#post5126934 Bob, I hope you do not mind me posting this on a number of your threads. Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #314 ---
You are always free to post especially when you refer to Scooby Doo. I am tired of the Beagle act also and have banned two of them from my threads. It is one thing to promote a trading style (which they really dont, they just attack others) all they do is ravage other people's trading styles. Dave referred to it as a gang rape. I dont look at trades as one in and one out. I look at a group of trades as a unit and trade the unit. I know that concept is hard to comprehend at times but it takes 3 dimensional thinking to do that. One in and out is very 2 dimensional thinking. Nothing wrong with that but I have an alternative trading style. What bugs the heck out of them is I am profitable with it and that just doesnt compute with them. As you know in my trend thread two of them are contributing and that is welcome (to a point if they stay on subject) because I have counter traded for so long that going back to trend trading is kind of a new experience for me. But it doesnt mean I have abandoned my other threads or philosophies concerning them. We both know range trading is very dangerous thing to do right now especially now that Italy has hit the news. I was expecting Ireland, Spain, or Portugal next. I thought Italy would suffer after a 2nd Euro country would hit the news. That adds a whole new variable that may send Forex to new levels of volatility. So even I am not trying to range trade now. Anyway post away my friend, I really wish others would post more, it stimulates my thinking and I love to teach. I like to hear other people's successes and help with some failures too.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I refer to them as team idiotic juvenile delinquents. They are either juveniles pretending to be adults or they are paid agents of the criminals trying to dissuade people from trying profitable systems (or Both). We know how good your systems and general principals of trading are, anyone wants to try it they are welcome to do so and you have been always most helpful, patient and kind. Anyone who thinks NB system is a waste of time they can go elsewhere with our best wishes. You have published your live trades long enough to prove consistent profitable results. As far as I am aware this is unique in FF. I published my results for the first six months of this year. I have not been trading that much since July due to lack free time. I will resume trading in earnest in January and will publish my results twice a month. My plan is to trade either 1H or 4H TF using VER5 method but in the direction of the trend in D1 TF according to VER10.1, replacing the sixths with Squalou`s S/R indicator. Does this sound a bit stupid? Kind regards

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I have a potential replacement for the sixths indicator it takes into account volatility and has given some dynamite counter trades both the 4H and Daily charts. I would like to discuss it with you sometime when you're free. A good time would be Saturday night EST USA. I could send you some pics and the idea. I think the idea will work just great but I am trying to figure out how to make it simpler. Anyway let me know when you are free and we will try to hook up on Skype. Time to go play some softball.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I think FF should remove people who can't participate in a productive way, and don't on a consistent basis. I can see a few comments here and there, having some fun as some would call it, but every post made contains blanket statements, with no backup of information or other ideas, and just bashing other folks. This is simply negative, non-productive energy for all. I mean I would rather spend my time figuring out how to make more money or the system better, than wasting time responding or just reading posts from those who just want to stir the pot. Anyway, getting on to the positive, I have had very positive results with CTR 1H, 10.0 trend trading on the daily and the recovery system. You can trade Forex like equities, similar to an investment manager. That is the way I trade equities, so these systems work well with my style of trading. I have begun to work on 10.1 and a methodology for the stops to try and diversify that part of my trading. I will expand on it in the trend thread. Although, I have asked myself a time or two, why change what is working so well and divert my time doing it? Bob, thanks for the concepts of your systems and sharing with the community. Best of trading to all. George

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thanks George and I do encourage more people to post, it alleviates some of the load off of me in trying to support 3 active threads. In reality I dont mind a good friendly debate but there are a few who are worthless in that department. Asking hard questions helps me to improve myself and my systems. Just to let you know I was a low 70% trader with 5.0 and now with 10.0 I am consistently above 80% in my winning percentage. So I keep improving. Too bad some people can only criticize but cant post something better.

--- 帖子 #319 ---

I thought I would post this here, since it pertains to range trading, although this response was in the trending thread. I went back to my CTR 1H trade results and did a review of the data. Actually, should have done this along time ago, but wanted to see if my perception of the AUD/NZD was correct. Actually, it was not that bad, but the negative part of the perception is one trade I needed to go to L3 to recover, so that probably stuck in my head vs. the shear % of trades which you need to recover from. Anyway, from the time CTR came out to end of summer, here are some results from 7 pairs listed by: Trades with no recovery needed / Trades needing recovery / % of trades with no recovery GBP/CAD - 16/3 - 84.2% AUD/NZD - 19/3 - 86.4% NZD/JPY - 17/2 - 89.5% CAD/JPY - 24/2 - 92.3% NZD/CAD - 14/1 - 92.8% USD/JPY - 12/0 - 100% EUR/GBP - 48/0 - 100% The GBP/CAD &amp; AUD/NZD were the worst performers of my group, as well as once they got away, they ran into L2 and L3 for recovery. The others in the group just moved to another level and just ranged again, so recovering from those were much easier. No doubt the EUR/GBP seems to be the ultimate range trading pair. After seeing this information and for some fun, I think I will demo the CTR 1H in the "trending" market times and see if the results are similar and increase the lot size a bit on the EUR/GBP. Hope the above is helpful. Next summer when I am definitely back into range trading, I am going to steer away from the AUD/NZD and GBP/CAD. Best of trading to all. George

THank you Kelisa!

What exit strategy did you use - atr, fixed, bb great info by the way

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I used median of the BB to set a stop to BE. If it stalled or I saw a reversal pattern on a smaller timeframe, I would take profit. It was mostly manual last time, with some TP hitting the other band. This demo run I have added two items to help with less manual involvement on the exit: MPTM set to 40/10 and Squalou's daily SR indicator. If the other band is below a daily SR, I will set the TP just above/below the SR line vs. waiting for the other band. The other area I am going to evaluate is the entry with the SR indicator. Ideally, I would like to get entries just prior to a daily SR line. Once I get the demo account linked up with myfxbook, I will send a link for people to follow. Best of trading to you... George

--- 帖子 #325 ---
This is an example of the idea of an entry combined with the daily S/R indicator for CTR 1H from my last post... George

Hi guys! I hope someone can say a good tip to close my positions somehow. Im a newbie as you see and i hope i can alive this. What do you think about these position? Where and what should i close? Im trying to find the peak to close the buy position. Or should I close the sell now? (if it was a news related things) Im just trying to find the best trading method. And today I went to lower TFs. Can somebody help me? Edit: Maybe at H4 support line it will go up? Should I wait until price go up to R1? Please, help me.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Quick questions are you trading off a 5M chart? Second are you on a demo account? Becuase if you are not then you should, because no newbie should be trading 4 lots on a real account, when they are not sure how the system works.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Egads, why anyone would do a buy on a euro now I dont know. Neither trade makes much sense to me at this point, anyway it has been done, now what? Just some pointers. Lot size is way out of proportion to account size. I would be trading .10 lots with 5000 dollars. The fastest way to get killed in this business is greed. You need to get rid of that buy at some point so look for the best bounce you can get and close it out. The sell probably will work if you pick a good spot to get out of the buy. Hopefully price will go back up to that Daily line and you can get out of the buy and then go back down and save your sell. Dang you just cant trade this way, you have no wiggle room to get out of a jam.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I think I was sure (I used the daily trend trading system), I put a sell position under S1 (1.3350) and the price go down until that. After this I closed it with little profit as I saw it goes to another direction. After this I started to look for 5M chart. Made some profit here and the price suddenly go down. My sell position is closed with profit. After this i hedged some more profit. Now Im waiting to go back that really ugly buy position (I hope it will reach the R1 line - 1.33624) Yes, unfortunately its a live account. I just tried the 4 lot, but never again... It was a good lesson. Edit: Nanningbob! Thanks for your reply. Your systems are great, I was stupid. I would be more patient, but i dont know what happens if I put a sell limit under S line, It reached and start to go another direction. So I dont know how much time should I wait on daily trend, to go into the direction what I need.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Shady313 that is very unfortunately. I have a feelling this is a live account and it does not look good. I did the same mistakes. DON"T TRADE SO MANY LOTS. Your position is to big for the 5000 dollar account. Nobody knows for sure where the price is going in the next day or two. I looks like you cut your losse and at this point you are hedged, it wont/ matter which way the price will go you have the same loss as long as you keep both orders open.maybe the best think is just to close both orders and start over with the right risk for your account. This is just my opinion, most likely this is what i would do.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Thanks for the answer! Fortunately, my sell position is closed in the best time. It was fortune nothing more. Here is a picture with the actual statement: http://d3test.atw.hu/xy3.jpg

very happy for you.... please try not to throw your money away. Be smart.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Now I'm waiting for 1.3360 hit, what do you think guys about this? Can it go up to this line or higher?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Well by what I see, after getting over the lot sizes and similar issues, you need to learn how to use the system. I do know people using it on the 5M chart but thats because they like it. If you are just learning stick to the 4H and daily charts. That is what most people will be referring to here and what I think are just easier to use. Also when did you open the trades? The picture you posted is a little small when I try to open it. If they where opened this week you have all the news out of Europe coming out and on top of that U.S. holidays so markets will be out of whack. You have to look at more than just the system, you may see the S1 and D1 lines on the chart but if you would have looked at the big picture of the whole week with news and holidays you would've known the Euro was a bit hectic.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thats hanging around a nice psychological s/r level for me so it might hit it but don't know if it'll break it. I see the euro going down to 1.30 in the near future so I am not sure what to tell you.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The thing is lot sizing properly. Right now it is easy to make money off of the Euro because we all know it has to go down no matter what temporary happy news hits for the short term. Until the Euro gets a more permanent answer to their problem I cant see it going up, only re-tracements. However, his lot size is so big that he must have a perfect move up to release the buy and the perfect move down to release the sell otherwise his account is cooked. I would at least play for the perfect move that price may rebound but that would be a tough play. Then his last choice would be to close the buy and play the sell but if the rebound is strong he would get into trouble on that trade also. one penny per 500 dollars and learn the business after that you can go to bigger things.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Now I know, I was crazy, good lesson. (I wanted to scalp that period) So I lost it. The remaining balance is 4000 euros. What size of lot do you recommend for this? (0.5-1?) When should I enter to trend? (on the London session start? How I know, the trend goes to another direction? About how many pips can I get with trend trading per week? I have to recover 4000 euros (I lost 2000 euros, the other 2000 was a past thing for the account im working on). Thanks for the help! I will be more careful.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
If you are going to be running with 4k euros on your account definitely under .5 more like a nickel if I was you, since you don't know the system well and will loose money. A smarter thing I think would be to just used a 1k account and trade pennies until you get the hang of the system and focus on how many pips you can average a month. Forget about how much money you make for now and concentrate on pips. Once you average a certain amount of pips week after week and month after month, it is all about increasing lot sizes. What broker are you on?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thank you. I'm on FinFX. I have problem only with entry points. I dont know when price starts to go to another direction. So I need the entry and exit points. If it breaks the S1 line with 20 pips is that ok? Or How do you put your pendings?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I would like to add to Gustav answer. I look at percentage of account increase. If you can consistently hit 5-10% a month you are in the professional trader field. Too many people get the idea that this is an easy million. It is not. I know there are people who do better but they are a rare lot. So trade small and learn. It goes like this, if you trade one penny on a 1000 dollar account you would have to lose 100,000 pips to lose all your money. If you do that you know that Forex trading is not for you. If you trade 10 cents you would have to lose 10,000 pips to lose all your money. If you trade 1.00 lots you would have to lose 1000 pips to lose all your money. 1000 pips loss is easy to do. 10,000 pips I think is much harder to do. 100,000 pips, never heard of anyone doing that. My question is this. How much tuition are you willing to pay to learn this business. If you are a rookie, losing a 1000 pips in one month, heck in one week is very doable. Do you want to pay 10.00 dollars, 100.00 dollars or 1,000.00 dollars in tuition???? The choice is yours.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Ok, so I should start with the lowest lot (0.1 on ECN). Thats almost 4000 pip move. I need an advice with entry and exit points. So Nanningbob, I would like to start the trend trading system. When do you open position for sell if its out from ranging on daily chart or during raging? If there is a new candle after the ranging one and under blue and red lines? If its already trending under R1 line -X pips? End when do you take profit? S1 line plus/minus some pips? What should be the SL? The blue line? Or red? Or you dont stop with loss, you just start to trade on the other trend and wait days/months until it goes back? I know you already made instructions but i want to know if something isnt clear for me.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
This is a range trading thread. You should post your question at the 10.0 trend section. you will get more help there.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Shady, After reading the past few pages of your post, I see that you are too eager and impatient to trade. Typical of many traders, including myself. I was once an impatient trader who thinks I know how to scalp but end up wiping out 2 live accounts eventhough my max lot size was 2 lots only. In summary, I guess its better you FULLY understand how NB10.1 works: Daily SR, H4 SR and over market sentiments. Look at Daily for DT or UT but market sentiments prevails. Then, go down to H4 or H1 to make a more precise entry. An entry means on a retracement and not chase the PA. Practice a demo account too until you can constantly make +pips. Then only you can pull the trigger on the live account. Believe me, it pays to be patient. imo

--- 帖子 #345 ---
plus: stick to 1 or 2 only trading strategies, otherwise you will be strategies hopping and lose yourself. regards.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Good advice, also trade lot sizes that you can go to bed and sleep and not worry about it wiping your account on a big move. I shoot for 10% a month, I have found out if I try for more I end up in doo doo land. This may surprise you but I only trade one penny per 500 dollars in my account. That is very safe and would take 50,000 pips in losses to wipe out, yet I can make 10% almost every month. Learn this one lesson and you can become a successful trader. Once you get experience you can go for the occasional home run but it seems the smaller I trade the more money I make. LOL if that makes any sense to you. I can outlast any market move and countertrade it back to 0 loss. That keeps my equity curve constantly going up. Took me years to learn that lesson. Doesnt mean it is for everyone but I am totally relaxed if something goes wrong. For example, my computer went out yesterday at home and didnt know how my trades were going until today when I came to work. Had a bunch of nice profits, however, if everything had gone against me my account was in no danger. That is how I live in this Forex jungle.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Couldn't have said it better, over Thanksgiving here in the U.S. I forgot to close my trades before leaving home and my remote connect wasn't working so I was unable to close any trades from last week until Monday. But since my lots sizes werent too big for my account I wasnt worried yeah I had one losing trade but the other trades where in profit and made up for the one loss. The main point is if the lot size doesnt let you rest at night it is way too big.

--- 帖子 #348 ---

It is common for some currencies to open the year with a run. I would give it a couple of days to let the market settle into the new year before starting up. I usually restart trading the 2nd week unless there is a big news story and I know where the market is heading.

From my post back in November about the effectiveness of the EUR/GBP, I have completed 2 months of testing with the pair. Two areas I incorporated on somewhat of a manual basis was trying to enter closer to S/R levels and using ATR (average true range). So, if I was on the computer and the pair was breaking the band, I would turn off the EA and let it run to the S/R level or the majority of its ATR, then would turn on the EA for entry. I could not execute this every time, but a fair number of trades I was able to manipulate for better entry. From the results, 35 trades were taken and none needed recovery. This was one area I was curious about - can the pair range in the trending time as it did in the summer time? There were 6 losses (5 of them were buys) which is 83% winning %. You will notice in month 1, both buys and sells were taken. For month 2, I only took sell orders. The second month was much more effective due to the fundamental state of the EUR. So, from the testing, I feel positive about moving on to try and optimize the EA a bit more and run this all year long. For the next testing period, I have adjusted the EA to try and simulate the entries I was doing manually, which looked more optimized than the current 1H CTR. Here are the parameters for the entry: - 3MA is above/below BB - Price has moved back below/above BB - Daily ATR is at 75% or more of ATR 14. We might find the ATR criteria will restrict our entries too much, but it does provide good protection for those times when the bands are tight, then price moves, such as Monday morning, London Time. We might need to adjust down a bit on the 75% number. For the exit, I am going to start with a 30 Pip TP. If we are optimizing the entry based on the full range, hopefully we can achieve above 60%+ of the range for TP. The ATR has been running about 55 Pips. Again, I will be adjusting the TP manually when needed around S/R lines. Here is the link to the myFXBook account for details. I have been messing with a few other things on the account, but you can see EURGBP trade results. https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/1...1h-demo/195168 George

Hello George , Can you tell me what system do you use your self .Is it the 10.1 version from nanningbob described here in his posts ....which he described here in his posts.If so how do you set up your paremeters and do you trade at manualy or both auto/manualy .Or perhaps you do not use his 10.1 version. Kind Regards, saso

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi there , Do I put both in the indicators folder only . Or one goes in there and the other in the experts folder. Please assist me with this : .ex4 and .mq4 those 2 files . And than I use them on 4H OR 1H charts or on Daily charts .I will appreciate your input . Also I follow up you screen charts from a to m .. to be able to understand this version how it works .... I guess this version works manually to be there present on the charts to execute trades !! Kind Regards , saso

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Saso, the above results were generated with Bob's 10.0 1H CTR Both EA, which is located in the 10.0 Trend Thread, Page 1. The only settings I changed was to only take short trades in month 2 of the test and the lot size. I trade it both auto and manual. The entry is auto, however I do adjust my TP based on SR levels. Also, this EA will exit on the other side of the BB and at times I will remove it to avoid that function. I am testing a slightly different version with an ATR function included as I discussed above. I tried to simulate those manually on some trades during the testing. We will see if it will be more effective on entry or not. Hope that helps. George

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi George, If you dont mind because you are advanced on this so much than me , if you can printscreen the charts , and also the printscreen of the 10.0 1H CTR Both EA parmeters set up and email them to me !!! My email is sasoiv35@bigpond.com Would like to see and compare them with my set up . I will very much appreciate that effort from you if you can do that for me !! Kind Regards , saso

Sorry to take a few days to get back with you. I will send the preset file, which shows the parameters of the results generated from the testing. The only criteria I changed was lot size and on the common tab, just setting short position only for month 2. Enclosed is a screen shot of a recent entry with the system and it shows exactly how it enters. As I mentioned during my testing I would manually let these types of entries run further in the range before turning on the EA, when I was in front of the computer. I am currently testing a modified version which uses ATR so entries are taken closer to the day range vs. the enclosed example. Best of Trading to you. George

--- 帖子 #361 ---
@nanningbob: And I keep looking where you enter the trade, just notice that it use bots . Not an offense, but actually I am not into EA. Setting that aside what I understand is that you use two 1H MA and if the prices goes out the fast/shorter period MA when the short period MA above the long period MA then enter a short position. If I trade this manually, do I enter when the prices pass through the line or when the candle close. If it's when the candle close it would be convenience to trade this way because we only need to check every hour when the candle close. Thanks in advance .

--- 帖子 #362 ---
10.1 is a manual system that uses pending orders. 10.0 uses EAs to place orders when you see certain conditions exist. After the EA places the order you manage the trade. Now unless you want to sit at your screen all day looking for the perfect entrance you can use EAs. That is what I use them for. Now if you dont want to use EAs you can use pending orders which are nothing more than an EA used by the dealer. Yes it is an EA. A computer program places your order when price crosses some line on your screen. My EAs do the same thing, place an order when price crosses a line on your screen. Now if you are so anti EA that you wont use pending orders then your alternative is to sit in front of a screen all day waiting to place an order by pushing a button. I have better things to do. Sorry if this came across a little harsh but I get tired of the crowd that criticizes EAs but then uses pending orders which is the same thing just different location of the computer.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Sorry if I offense you in any way. If your EA works like pending order, I think it's okay. After read your post, I look into your EA and doing some backtest. I used to play online games using bot for a few year and somehow I understand a bit to configure your EA. I attach some result from your EA on USDCAD. PS: I run your EA without concerning the trend, so it'll buy even in down trend.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I believe EAs work if you manage them. In other words play babysitter. I use them when I see a set up I like and then turn the EA on to take the trade. Better than sitting at the screen all day. My point on pending orders is a computer program takes the trade when price hits the line or point you want. EAs do the the same thing. From studying charts and EAs I discovered that most ideas for EAs are profitable is you babysit them. I have an EA I am testing now that backtest a 80%+ win ratio but you need to take out the occasional losers manually. If you do this then the EA will work.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
If you are configuring EA, I think the one which should advance to the forward test is the one which give less drawdown not the one with biggest profit. I think avoiding risk came first, I choose configuration that give less drawdown. I attach the complete result. I found an interesting fact that currency pair moves differently in a downtrend and in an uptrend. As you can see, the period that I use start at higher price point relative to the point when it ends. But the result is that buy strategy overall gave less drawdown(risk) and bigger profit. The buy EA strive in a downtrend and in an uptrend, but the sell EA strive only in a downtrend while it survive in an uptrend(the profit graph flat). The first graph I attach is the buy EA balance the second one is the sell EA, the period I used is in the third graph. Add: I had a weird result using the same setting for EURUSD and GBPUSD pairs, the drawdown is somehow too low and the profit is too big. The period used is longer from 2006 which is three times the period of test in USDCAD. The chart attached in the bottom. Add2: I think it happened maybe because the lower spread on those pairs.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
What you said is proved in my backtest . Further looking at CTR H1 result and comparing them to daily chart, I understand that what you said in 10.0 booklet help to avoid some of the big looser trades. What I notice is when open price above/under the two MA using CTR H1 could lead to a big loss. BTW, I do a small modification to your EA. To trigger a trade the difference of the two MA should be at least 9 and the entry is 9 pips earlier. By limiting a trade with 9 pips difference on the two MA you got less trade, and by entering 9 pips between the fast MA makes you trade more. Overall the trade is 20% - 30% less than the original EA but average profit are bigger. The downside of the backtest is I couldn't change the entry size(lot size) according to balance size. When your account grew you keep gaining/losing same amount of profit/loss. This could be seen in the balance chart, the longer it runs the lesser the slope. The strenght is your system in a backtest is the use of a non repainting indicators, well at least not after the candles close. I use every tick from M1 to simulate a real time trading, it takes longer and the data period is shorter but the result are more valid. I use 1 lot because it's easier to see how much your profit/loss as 1 pips in 1 lot trade is $10. PS: Right now I'm playing with your trending EA. I haven't take look deeper how day to day trade in the result I post earlier.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Well keep up the good work and hopefully you will improve the system. Thank you for your input.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
For the next testing period, I have adjusted the EA to try and simulate the entries I was doing manually, which looked more optimized than the current 1H CTR. Here are the parameters for the entry: - 3MA is above/below BB - Price has moved back below/above BB - Daily ATR is at 75% or more of ATR 14. From my last post, I believe I have the EA working now with the above modified criteria from CTR 1H and now ready for a demo testing run. Below is a screenshot of the first trade on the account and I marked the entry location of both. Looks like the above version on this one would have improved by about 13-15 pips. The interesting thing to evaluate over the two month or so is how many trades will it take with the ATR criteria compared to the current CTR 1H. However, from the looks of the chart, it seems to handle a nice run pretty well. Here is the link to the myFXbook account, which I created for this next run if you want to follow along. https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/e...gu-fade/248350 Best of trading to you all. George

Hi George, The url you gave can not be visited without login data. I would like to trade range trading system manually. What are the indi's used for that and the rules to go by? Regards, Ben

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi George, Could you please explain how the ATR is used in the chart; I mean, how do you plot this in the chart (Daily ATR is at 75% or more of ATR 14), so that it can be used in manually trading? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Passer, would you be willing to share the EAs that you have made changes to. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Ben, I am having an issue with the myFXbook systems I have set-up. Some are set private and some public. For some reason it is blocking all. So, what I did for this test run is set up a trade explorer here on FF. If you go to my homepage you will be able to see it there. It is called E/G CTR 1H. I am testing another EA on the G/U and that is different. Only the E/G trades apply to the CTR 1H. The indicators are all the same as Bob's CTR 1H, except I added the ATR function and moved the trigger point of the trade when the price comes back into the BB vs. when it exits outside the BB. Below is the criteria for a trade. Indicators: Moving Average, Period = 3, Shift = 0, MA Method = Linear Weighted, Apply to = Low (blue line on chart) Moving Average, Period = 3, Shift = 0, MA Method = Linear Weighted, Apply to = High (purple line on chart) Bollinger Bands, Period = 20, Shift = 0, Deviations = 2 PivotsD_v5, I only use this indicator for the info box in the upper left corner which shows daily range (ATR), 14 day ATR, spread, etc. It does alot more with pivot lines, etc. but I set those with the background color because I don't use them. Entry Rules 1. Price and 3MA must break above BB Then 2. When price crosses back into BB AND Daily Range (ATR) &gt; 75% of ATR 14 - Take the trade Exit Rules Start with 30 pip TP and adjust with S/R. I don't use the other side of the band as an exit. So, if you look at the enclosed chart in the upper left corner, the ATR 14 is 54.2 Pips. 75% of 54.2 is 40.7 Pips. That means we will not take a trade until the daily range of the pair has reached a range of 40 Pips. The idea here with this criteria is to let the pair get almost to full range, then hopefully come back in the range for a trade. It also protects you against those times where the band is tight and then takes off. Instead of taking the entry at only 20 Pips of range, it waits until 40. The testing will prove if this is really effective and can help improve entries for better pips per trade. Now, out of all the trading in the summer and this winter, the last trade on EUR/GBP is now requiring recovery. We will see how this goes and I will continue to take shorts trades as they emerge with the EA. Enclosed is a template which shows all the indicator set-up and the PivotsD. Hope all that answers your questions. Good trading to you... George

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Here is a current example. In this case price and 3MA have broken past the BB. The current range is 39 and 14 day is 49, so we are greater than 75% on the day. Now, you just wait for price to break back thru the BB. Right now that would be &gt;0.8453. I will update when the trade would be executed. George

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Here is the chart showing the actual entry once price came over the BB. Entry was taken one candle later at 0.8449. George

With the help of FF and their trade explorer product, here is the url to link directly to the account of this test: http://www.forexfactory.com/george*adams#88 I am testing a couple different strategies with this explorer, so only the EUR/GBP trades apply to this EA and test. One nice feature they have is to link directly to specific trades. Below are links to the first 3 trades, which were tough due to the run the EUR/GBP took, but pulled back in for some profits. 2 shorts were profitable and 1 long was breakeven. Hopefully, that run is behind us, which out of about 80-100 trades this summer (live) and test 1 (demo), this was the first one which I did take a second position as then entry presented itself. http://www.forexfactory.com/george*a...+trade26388959 http://www.forexfactory.com/george*a...+trade26201833 http://www.forexfactory.com/george*a...+trade27081647 In terms of the entry, I liked where we entered and the EA seems to be entering at the correct spot. Hopefully we will get 4-5 trades per week going forward and generating some nice results. Hope this enclosed info is helpful. George

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Bob, surely the initial DD will be 2-3x higher if the losses on the pairs go to hundreds of pips each if you dont hedge? AND if after hedging you have no pairs left to profit from, you can always decide to close out the profitable leg when the trend is running out of steam. So you have a choice and in the meantime you are limiting your losses. Is this not the best of both worlds?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Of course the key to hedging is undoing the hedge. I think 10.0 gives good signal as to when to undo it. Because I am in the USA I cant hedge anymore so I am not as proficient at it as I wish I could be. I would prefer taking a hedge over a big loss though. Hedge allows me to take a time out and plan a strategy.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Bob, you mean the size was dependent on how much the loss was on the hedged trade? How much larger was the lot size of your normal trades if you can hedge? thank you

--- 帖子 #379 ---
You can hedge but it is much more hassle and you need more capital. In theory you can have two accounts with criminal like ibfx and use one of the accounts for the hedge trades, you can transfer funds instantly between the two. BUT and it is a big BUT, you need more capital since you do not benefit from the offsetting of the margins. I hope they reverse this absurd law as soon as possible (highly unlikely). The only people it serves is the futures criminals. Imagine if tomorrow a Country like Saudi Arabia passes a law stating that legal action would be taken against anyone selling alcohol to their citizens anywhere in the world . There would be worldwide outcry! What this law does is exactly the same thing... Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I am not sure what you are asking. Do you mean lot size? There comes a time when you must undo the hedge and go with a break even trade on the losing side. That is what I was talking about.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
what I took from your old post was: you hedged a losing trade and when the USA session was over and the pair was ranging, you tried to recoup the loss for that day. out comes the 4H chart and in the next 4hr period you close the buy part of the hedge with a sell order at the top price of the previous 4H bar and will close out the sell side of the hedge with a buy order at the bottom of the 4H bar. if that wouldn`t cover your loss completely, you would also have another order in, the size of that one dependent on the balance of the hedge loss. that`s how I picked it up, but might be completely off. another question: you said: when on hedge demo you could place orders much larger than if hedging is not possible. if hedging, could you give me a clue as to the size of an order if leverage = 100:1, trading 4 pairs per $ 1,000 account size? thank you

--- 帖子 #382 ---
OK lets say you are at 4 lot, even numbers makes hedging math easier. you are 100 down. If release your hedge and all you want is break even. subtract the profit, lets say 50 pips you would set your trade at 4 lot and would need 25 pips to break even. present trade +25 profit trade +50 losing trade now at -75 Let us say you want to keep your profit and you are down -100 then at 4. you need +50 to break even, lot 6 +33 to break even and lot 8 plus 25 to break even. I think. So that would be the strategy and the math. You can correct my math if I am wrong, I dont have my calculator with me.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi George, I like your ATR approach but I'm a lousy programmer would you mind share a piece of code or PM me with some details. I suppose you set up a 7e variable with takes care of the ATR and implement that in the buy and sell condition. double Var1 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H1, 20, 2, 0, PRICE_CLOSE, MODE_UPPER, Current + 0);//PAIR, PERIODH1, MA period, Deviation, shift //double Var2 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 20, 2, 0, PRICE_HIGH, MODE_UPPER, Current + 0); double Var3 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H1, 20, 2, 0, PRICE_CLOSE, MODE_LOWER, Current + 0); //double Var4 = iBands(NULL, PERIOD_H4, 20, 1, 0, PRICE_LOW, MODE_LOWER, Current + 1); double Var5 = iMA(NULL, PERIOD_H1, 3, 0, MODE_LWMA, PRICE_HIGH, Current + 0); double Var6 = iMA(NULL, PERIOD_H1, 3, 0, MODE_LWMA, PRICE_LOW, Current + 0); I would let the original CTR run, and simultaneously run the modified ATR CTR in a second window . Both on a live account and study the different outcomes. Please PM me if you think the modification is not ready enough for publication here. And thanks for sharing your template, so nice for me eyes.. regards Hans..

after much consideration I decided to trade AUD/NZD exclusively, because this pair bounces up and down the most. I will place a hedging trade if a trade has a 100 pip loss and learn the art of unhedging over time. Another way of protecting my trades might be to place a pending buy stop/sell stop orders above and below the range for a run-away trade, probably with a small stop loss. I will backtest this idea to see if it has any merit. Anybody already using this idea? I dont know much about margin and I find it quite confusing. can anybody tell me the lot size I can trade for a 10k account trading just 1 pair? thank you

--- 帖子 #385 ---
The Aud/Nzd has been one of my more profitable pairs over the years. I dont think you can go wrong with. The Chinese economy is slowing down but also maturing (it has affect the AUD a lot the last couple of years) I am hoping it will have less affect on the AUD thereby making he AUD/NZD a more stable pair to trade. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
thank you Bob, your help is much appreciated

--- 帖子 #387 ---
still not sure about the lot size if trading only 1 pair with a 10k account. if trading 12 pairs unhedged 1 penny per $1,000 seems to be the norm. a lot higher if hedged so maybe at least 0.02 lot per $ 1,000. trading 1 pair 0.24 lot per $ 1,000 = 2.4 lot per 10k account. but only after trading this system for a while ofcourse

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yonnie, it is crucial that you learn how leverage and margin works. How big you can trade with a $10,000 (or any size) account entirely depends on your margin/leverage rate. (But how big you *should* trade is a different matter altogether!) Anyway, a broker with 50:1 leverage will lend you 50x your margin (account balance) which means the maximum trade size you can open is something less than or equal to 50x your account balance. Similarly, if your account is $10,000, then a leverage rate of 50:1 implies that to open a trade of $10,000, which as an aside is unleveraged (and assuming you can in fact do this subject to lot size minimums and so on), would require 1/50th or 2% margin used (think deposit) to open. So you'll open the $10,000 trade, and $200 of your $10,000 will be held back as deposit against your open trade, leaving the remaining $9,800 free for other trades. Different brokers/account also have different lot sizes: A standard lot in forex is 100,000 units of currency, a mini lot is usually 10,000 and a micro lot is 1,000 units. You should know what your lot size and minimum trade size is, so that you can calculate the actual number of units and consequent value of your trades. For example, if you trade 1 standard lot, of say usd/jpy, then you'll have bought (or sold) 100,000 units of USD, priced in Yen. This would mean that on a $10k account you'd be leveraged 10:1 on that position. This is already IMHO a dangerous level of leverage for a single position. Another example, if you trade 1 mini lot of GBP/USD, then it means you buy (or sell) 10,000 units of GBP, or about $15800 worth (assuming a GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.58). On a $10,000 account this is therefore about 1.58x leveraged, which is much safer but still slightly leveraged. Again, do not overleverage, ensure you understand your nominal (effective) leverage of your open positions against your account balance.

Well, since I manually do most of my own SL and profits and trade small enough they cant margin me out. Criminals really cant hurt me. I did a company out of Singapore once on another guys account and their margin wipeout program actually took price below 00.00 to a negative number to cause a margin call.

wonder if it makes a difference if a broker has a trading desk or not. brokers like Gomarkets do not have a trading desk and being regulated in Aussie would that not be safer?

A note from Steve Hopwood's thread: Important......just got this from a coder i know...."Metaquotes (the publisher and developer of Metatrader 4) just released a new build, 418. Unfortunately, they decided to change the main logic behind Metatrader 4's programming language, without notifying any of the developers'................so be careful of any update especially 416 to 418..it just might cause you ea's and indicators to not work any more.

Hi Bob, Greetings from Singapore! I’m new to your strategies, and have read the booklets and all 27 pages of this thread. I think you have written the booklets with your older followers in mind. Your older followers will have no problem comprehending what u are trying to say, but for new follower like me, it will take time and patience to decipher your “not so easily understood” systems. Though daunting, I am determined to surmount the obstacles bit by bit. Hope u can help me with that. I got very jealous of the kind of returns that u all are chalking up and I don’t want to be left out of the excitement For a start, I would like to concentrate on H1 range trading before I move to others. Unfortunately there is no write up on range trading in your NB10.0D booklet. This is what I gathered here and there from this thread : Buy Setup When 3MA goes under lower Bollinger band 1.0 deviation, EA will enter a buy. EA will take profit when 3MA goes above upper Bollinger band 1.0 deviation. If position goes into a negative 100 pips, manually perform a recovery by going to the 4 hour chart and wait for candle to close above both 3MA and Bollinger upper band 1.0 deviation and enter another buy position to average down. Close both positions when the summation of both position shows a break even. Is my understanding correct? Any part wrong? More Questions : 1)From what I understand, this EA cannot be left totally on its own. When a position goes into red, we need to babysit and manually try to get ourselves out of the bad position using recovery. Most of the time, u post forward testing performance. But Post 363, Passerby performed a back test. Did he use a SL instead of recovery? I couldn’t visualize how to back test the baby sitting steps. If we want to fully automate this EA, and we are compelled to install a SL, what would be an appropriate SL? 2)Is the BB standard deviation supposed to be 1 or 2. You indicated 1 instead of 2 in your booklet, but I saw some people using 2. If I am not wrong, George Adams is using 2. Hope u can clear my doubts. Thanks!!

If we want to fully automate this EA, and we are compelled to install a SL, what would be an appropriate SL? It is hard to backtest this because I will use recovery. you can backtest using a SL but to me SL are flexible depending on fundamentals. If I know a strong fundamental is working I dont trade this method. For example I stopped last fall with the Euro news. I still think you can trade this with certain non volatile pairs like the aud/nzd gbp/cad etc. I am not at this time using the method though because the Euro zones difficulties. Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and then French banks could be in deep doo doo at any time. I do not wish this but I recognize that instability can hit the market at any time. 2) Is the BB standard deviation supposed to be 1 or 2. You indicated 1 instead of 2 in your booklet, but I saw some people using 2. If I am not wrong, George Adams is using 2. I am not at home and will need to get back to you on this one. Hope u can clear my doubts. Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi Bob, Thanks for providing some enlightenment! Based on my very limited MT4 knowledge, I found it puzzling how they could backtest the recovery part which requires human judgement. But I remember seeing a recovery EA somewhere. The next time I see it, I will copy the link and post it here and we can figure out how they do it. I will be most glad to be proven wrong, because that means we can automate the whole range trading strategy, or at least with minimal babysitting or human intervention , isn’t that wonderful? I will start demoing soon. Please post more on range trading when u are free. Have a good day!

I am no coder either and used an EA builder to help formulate the criteria. Works just how I planned on entry, so happy with areas it takes entry. In my next post, I will share my thoughts on this last test and you have some good ideas for evaluating the effectiveness of the original CTR H1 and the one which uses an ATR. Best of trading to you.

Friends, first let me apologize for what I would consider to be a poor test from an execution perspective. I made a number of errors, which really skewed my feeling of the effectiveness. Some of those were letting a couple trades hit the BB on the other side and exiting (most on the losses, which I did not want) and opening multiple positions, when I did not want to. The other issue I ran into was time to allocate to managing the test. As traders, I am sure you all have a few systems you are evaluating or improving upon, with each taking time. As you succeed in some of those projects, those of course warrant more time. As you will see from the results, we would have been profitable, however, in the spirit of finding an improvement over the last test, I don't believe that has been accomplished. Here are my thoughts on the ATR test: 1. The entry point was spot on with the EA, which would take entry when the price broke thru the BB, the 3MA was above/below the BB, price came back and broke back through the BB and 75% or more of the ATR was reached. As you can see, a number of criteria is required for entry and that limited the number of trades it would take. The original CTR H1 would almost take trades daily, but this was maybe 1-2/week. I do know, there were a number of trades missed due to the ATR function, which would have done well. 2. Out of the trades taken, there were 2-3 which required a second entry. So, in this test many more recovery trades required on average. This leads me to the effectiveness of the ATR criteria. Logically, it makes sense to take a ranging trade when it is at it's daily range. However, in this case when the range is being met, perhaps that is when support/resistance is being broken and the pair begins ranging again above/below your entry. One thought is perhaps the opposite would work better where we want to avoid those times of reaching ATR due to breaking of SR? Probably in those cases there has been a significant news event driving the higher ATR and do we really want to be ranging that movement. Second thought is I like the entry point better (minus the ATR requirement) of this test vs. the original CTR H1. The CTR H1 takes entry when the price and 3MA have broken the BB. This last test I coded the entry when price comes back below/above the BB. If I were going to test again, that might be the approach I would take and see if I can achieve better results. As Hans, pointed out, perhaps demo accounts be set up for all 3 options (original CTR H1, with ATR greater than 75%, and ATR less than 75%) to view results for more conclusions. I hope this is helpful to those of you range trading. Good trading to you all. George

hi, well this system looks promising but i have one prob. Is this system written for professionals? Because i downloaded the 10.2 booklets 5.12 (zip files). Read all of them .... yet when i download the indicators, nothing is like what the books say!!! Scattering info in as many as 7 books isnt good, You explain the indicators well, but almost give no examples of how to use all these to make a trade. I read the thread &amp; i find Bolinger Bands, which if i remember correctly is mentioned in passing in the booklet i am reading!!! There's no info that explains the system &amp; how to use it properly, when to enter, when to get out, how to read the indicator. Info about these is so scattered to make a coherent reading. The indicators i have dont even correspond to the booklets versions esp the WOH. The TMA slope v1.4b works ok ..... can you please make this a little easier? Explanations of the indicators in different booklets is ok, but the system and all its indicators and how they come together to make a trade possible should be in book. This is not the case as such ..this system just confuses yet looks very promising ...

That is because I have combined all my systems into 10.2, Because of the extreme volatility of the markets I am not recommending range trading right now. Most currencies are moving in long trends rather than ranging and the ones that are ranging can breakout at any time on some big news story. 10.2 works fairly simple.

hi nanningbob - just a quick question. recently came across your threads for the first time, and plan to spend a bit of time going through all the great materials. thanks for sharing the great materials. out of all the variations of your system, i assume the best version to focus on is 10.2? is this time system you yourself are currently trading in todays markets? many thanks.

FX-sniper I would go ahead a check out all the work being put in over at Steves forum where Bob and many others are focusing heavily on the 10.2 system and coming out with great variations. http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/php...forum.php?f=37

10.2a is the easiest and simplest version of the 10.0 series. Easy to follow and understand. Go to page 1 post 1: http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/php...p=26340#p26340
