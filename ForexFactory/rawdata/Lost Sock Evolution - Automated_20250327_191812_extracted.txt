From Last Week - GA - Friday.

Was a bit of a choppy day - LSE worked to keep in trend and take profit will flipping between longs and shorts.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Daily Overbought and Oversold has been written in again using the TMA + CG indicator to keep the EA from buying tops and selling bottoms.

Great example - Last Week - Friday - Cable.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
AUDUSD - EA was caught in sell cycles from previously.  Does not automatically continue to keep selling but waits for the market to show directional weakness and opportunity to cost average trades.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Here's an idea about how LSE will take partial profit - or - Take out the pairs of newly matched socks.

Very Kewl!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you for sharing, Magix...Will test it this week...

Hey Brother Bazze!!

Good to see ya still kicking it.

Let me know how we progress throughout the week, feel free to drop down a TE for reference.

\m/

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Elgappo!

Forgot to mention but is clearly shown in these sequence of trades...

Because the LSE is trained to wait for an appropriate position and will not look to take on an immediate market turn, in the EURAUD trades shown below, you can see that there was an opportunity to take additional short trades, but due to what was considered a FLAT market, the EA sat out this bunch.

Instead, on market gap up, took profits on what where missed on a trend-shift from previous.

No...not always going to work out in your favor...but kind of kewl when it does.

Added a Template folder to the first post.

This is the EA VIEW.  Logic based on the templates and indicators attached.

Should look something like the following when applied.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks for EA champ!

I am going to forward test the 4H timeframe with this EA. Ill post up results after a week or 2.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Welcome back, Magix.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
H4 timeframe....

Interesting.

Most of what I do is in the fast frame, have never really played on anything (automated) on anything longer than an M15, so would be really interested in what pairs and how they end up performing.

This one, as in the Trade Explorer attached is on an M1 chart.

Let me know how you make out.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hey Brother Rob!!

Thanks!

Good to see ya!

You ever get anything offshore for Forex so your not limited by FIFO?

Or, did they loosen up those restrictions in the US yet?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I'm currently with Forex.com, since they took over my FXCM account last year. Spreads have been really good on the majors. I'm seeing .9-1.2 pips on eurusd and usdjpy, which is very good, considering there is no commission. I'm trading a basic price action strategy on the daily and, so far, haven't seen any shenanigans(misquotes, slippage, stop-hunting, etc.). I'm also considering fxchoice, which accepts US clients and has no FIFO or hedge restrictions.

Welcome back, Magix.

You give us surprise every time you back again.

I am testing in M1 with the default setting. ICM ECN account was used.

I have added your test to the first post, will add any and all others that are kind enough to share the stats.

Rock on!!

Yo Mango!

Nice to see you hanging on!

I've played with these ideas for a couple of years now and seeing the success on THIS ACCOUNT has lead me into further developments.  I've got a few more irons in the fire, but there's a lot of boom and bust, a little more risk.

This, by way of development, could take something from these lower levels with a lower risk and have the potential for scaled growth...to a certain point.

Having only launched this one last week, I honestly never really looked at what it did, when it did it, but had the understanding of watching the same triggering logic on the other CORE.

Now that I've had time to actually analyze the trades, I do see that I may be able to further reduce some risk with additional exit logic in the same way as TMA does.

Overall, I am running this EXACT VERSION on one of my personal accounts, just started on Sunday and though I like to leave these run well enough on their own, will still take advantage of the manual controls from time to time.  Currently, my account is FLAT.  Give the AUD spikes, I managed to take profit and close all trades instead of leaving some of the lost socks in the basket.  Would probably continue to do this on a CLOSE ALL OPEN TRADES ON FRIDAY basis to keep things in check.  It's mostly just small chunks of change that I'm using this and a couple others, so steady progress for me is WAY better than crossing fingers into market close.

All Eyes will be helpful in the further development and I could definitely use your expertise, sir.

Even if ya don't get cash into the account, fire this motherfucker up on a demo and see what you can lend.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Good to see you around again Magix

Really like the EA --- did some sh1t backtest to see what you are doing -- very krool

Will set up a lap top to farward test --- I will be back with findings

Thanks again for the EA

Regards

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yo Brothermang!

This is a Trade System, directionally based and with the attached indicators.

Running a Backtest to get an understanding of the logic, is actually a very good thing.

The system itself can be traded manually and should be timeframe scaleable, so anybody looking to hone their personal trading can definitely gain something from how this works when it takes triggers and how it finds exits.

I just don't like a thread cluttered with backtest data info as the accuracy of it is typically bullshit and meaningless.

Welcome aboard for another ride!!

Look forward to seeing what your testing provides!

Hey Magix and everyone !!

At first thanks for all this!  I´m testing now only since yesterday, but it seems to work well.

But,

is it possible, to put in an option for News, like in Mrdfx´s Simple Daily Trend Reversal?
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=713593

To avoid that the EA open Trades like 30 minutes before and after at least high impact news? see pictures from this night!

And also maybe a max Lot size ( i´m trying martingale version) so it will not open trades with higher lotsize then maybe 0.10 ?

Thx i will also give you replies from the testing results!

Hey Berdsen,

First off, Welcome to ForexFactory!

I have worked on versions that don't trade on news days and by trade times to try and keep most relevant.

The unfortunate part, is that aside from exceptional times, like the one for EURNZD that you posted, the only thing this did was actually limit the profitability for the trading.

Much as I was reluctant to even keep martingale adds as a part of the code, I did try to leave it in as original of version as the author has made - with exception of actual triggering and exit strategies.

I don't recommend anybody work with Martingales...cost averaging can already offer enough of its own share of risk.  When moving to Martingale, the risk is even higher and the typical account size for these just isn't feasible for a lot of beginner or hobbyist traders.  I did get my feet wet in originally working with Martingale Type adds, and have seen them double accounts up to $10,000 - Live - Documented but have seen the explode even more.

Even just looking at the parent version of this EA - Trading with Cost Averaging - Same Sized Lot adds, trading uninterrupted, it did manage to gain 100% on account before seeing it's first couple of losses...and even at these, they were on Non-Press Days.

What am I saying?

Basically - No...I have no intentions of adding these 2 requests - There's No point.

I've been down this exact road to know there aren't enough changes to these sorts of strategies that will allow them to be safe.

That being said, I have posted the Mql of the original version on the first post, free for the taking.  Feel free to add, change, modify it as you see fit.  Any changes to this, you should still give credit to its original author - Voldemar227.

Hi Magix,

thank you for this usefull EA.

I have the Problem, that in 2017 everything work's well but in 2018 no Trades will be performed, also in Backtest.

The Errorlogs show no malfunctions?

Maybe you have an Idea.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
@Magix Thanks for EA mq4 source code. This was your "start point" correct?

Can you summarize (in "code speak") when your edited EA takes trades?

EA open a short trade when TMA prints a down arrow (at top band) and the price is below a big EMA (so we are trending down) and vice versa?
(taking shorts in this example will stop if the down trend reaches a specific "exhausted level" (per MACD definition?!) so the EA doesn't short the bottom?)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thank you for your Ideas.

I tested it a little bit more and find out, that on a different Timeframe (H1 instead of M15), it took only one trade in 2018 (in other Timeframes nothing happens).

In 2017 it tooks some trades every few Days (M15).

Maybe you can look again and test it on your own Platform (to avoid that i missed something :-)

Thanks

Hey Jagg,

The essence of the logic is based on price in relation to Moving Averages.

Though I have applied a MACD to the template, this is for simple visual representation purposes.

MACD Above Zero -> Trend defined as Long

MACD Below Zero -> Trend defined as Short.

As for the TMA+CG indicator, it is used for price in relation to this, with the trend identification through Moving Averages and what the tendencies seem to be.

As price continues to Move Down, EA will look to continue following trend and short.

If the market goes to FLAT - EA will look to either Restrict Trading - if no current trades are in place or will look to cost average out and look for profit before Not Trading anymore.

TMA + CG is also applied to the daily chart for a First Look.  If current price is above the Upper Band of TMA+CG, only Short positions will be considered based on Fast And Slow EMAs defining trend and obviously converse for oversold on the daily will only waiting for the EMAs define the trend as long and wait to trigger.

Now...if there are active trades and the trend shifts - By definition of the EA - we are in a totally new ball game!

Rather than Multiple Short a trend that went long, the idea of a Flattening Market that restricted initial trades will be enacted to cost average out and exit positions that are by the EA definition, currently trading against the trend.

Kind of long and convoluted, I know...but from my time spent in market, realize that there is no One Size Fit's All trade logic that can be automated, (Kinda).  Taking a position and waiting for a profitable exit will almost always inevitably work, but given that I've always loved the fast frame M1 charts, really don't like thinking about forever holds for scratch or profit.

Does this make sense?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Just a little visual to compare to the previous explanation...

If you look at Cable, for the last 2 trading weeks, it has been above the CG+TMA band - Meaning, No Long Positions were taken.

Now, this has limited profitability by range of motion - Seen in a quick glance at the trade summary.  1.9% overall profit from Cable and actually, if you look at a daily shot of EURUSD and AUDUSD with the applied template, you will see that these too are OVERBOUGHT - meaning no long trades were taken.

GBPAUD and EURAUD have so far been the most profitable as they've been sideways market, lots of volatility and a lot of opportunities for Longs and Shorts in accordance with the EA logic.

Throwing it all together...

No longs in Overbought Daily.

No Shorts in Oversold Daily.

Profit from the immediate direction and sit out what doesn't make sense.

Hi there

Of course I had to put it on a 1 pip break Renko which is killing my PC at home but I'm interested to see what you did with this version (not to mention the fact I love your EAs).

I was trading several variation of Remon's idea, even bought his EA once but didn't have a large enough capital to trade it safely.

Anyways, first trade fired away (in loss but I'm not sure thisidea/design was ever meant to work on a Renko offline chart, we'll see.

Once some charts clear up, I'll set up my demo account for this and see what this baby can do.

Oh, and if you can allow for a customized UserComment, please? Another trade just fired up, 20 pips away from the first one, so I got two sells now

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hey Dude, Good to see ya back!!

I been meaning to fire up some Renko 2pb to run this and a couple of other ideas, but would need to fire up another PC to make this happen...currently, I'm running on full capacity on everything I've got...

:|

Fire over some screen shots of the trades once you get a batch closed.  Would like to see if there's anything that I can assess visually to maybe make this a little more Renko Compatible.  Overall...as these are running on M1 charts, I'm not sure that there'd be a lot of difference, but really hard to say without having a little looksie.

Modifying the current version for the UserComment...prolly won't do that...

BUT!!!

After having compared the sticky situation that this one has gotten into over the last week, I think I have figured out a way to keep it a little better in trend while still observing Overbought and Oversold areas of the chart.  Once I have it thrown together, will make the UserComment a User Variable.

Look forward to seeing what you get on the Renkos!!

\m/

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Nice to be back on one of your trades

I don't understand the logic for the entries and the flat decision, DD isn't that huge in general but it is a bit big for a 1 Pip brick, same for M1, I guess.

Not sure how this version is different than the one Remon introduced in his thread and is selling, when I used it it was performing well until it got caught in a trend and blew up my account. Several times

If it was on my live account, I'm thinking about daily max profit, no need to stress it too much, me thinks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
The original for that fucking dipstick Remon was that there was no indication of trend or direction and the main feature of the logic by Voldemar verified this exact idea, tried by so many others, will BLOW UP more accounts that will allow grow.

The other thing proven...that Remon is a total fucking dipstick.

Code wise:

Buys and Sells original:
Inserted Code
[b]if((b==0)[/b] || (b>0 && (BuyMinPrice-Ask)>=BuyDist) || ((b>0 && (Ask-BuyMaxPrice)>=BuyDist) && TradeTrend==On))
[b]if((s==0) [/b]|| (s>0 && (Bid-SellMaxPrice)>=SellDist) || ((s>0 && (SellMinPrice-Bid)>=SellDist) && TradeTrend==On))

The highlighted portion...if b==0 and if s==0, will generate a buy and sell as soon as the EA is active on a live market. This moves under the assumption that inevitably, price will come back to a place where a gridded trade can profit and exit...this isn't entirely untrue as if it were, we would need to assume that it either bought the ABSOLUTE TOP or sold the ABSOLUTE BOTTOM of market and then went into an absolute reversal and this is in keeping with that fucking Dipstick's idea of market. With enough capital and a large enough grid size, it might actually work out...however...there are definitely better ways to play this out, ie. Choose current direction and wait for a primary trigger. What this does is to try to ensure that the EA only starts to buy when by logic, the market is a bull and only starts to sell when by logic, the market is a bear...

From there, it will continue to try and cost average out of the trades, AS LONG AS THE TREND IS STILL IN EFFECT.

This is the reason that you may see large gaps in play areas where trend may have changed - according to the logic.

BUT!!

After this, because we were long in a long market or short in a short market and the trend changed...

The logic is set to look for market weakness and start to cost average, even though the trend is currently against the open trades.

Again...

There are a couple of fixes that I have in mind for this logic and something that SHOULD keep it in better standings. Any changes here may limit profit, but may also decrease the size of account that it can be applied to...and ultimately scale in larger trades onto smaller accounts.

As it sits...

This EA, trading dimes, grosses about $250/week or 13% and so far, only required a Deposit of $2000. By the end of week 4, which is this week, we should have grossed $1000 in profit with a max DD of 52%ish...

Not Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!

But...

If we can do this with $1000 initial deposit...even better.

This kinda shit, I can keep racking up the small accounts and transfering over profits for safety...who knows when the Next Black Swan will hit?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
This is, ideally, how the trades should come out looking.

Left to Right:

Short in a Short market, cost averaged out and no more shorting. (Red Circle)

Longs in a long market. (Green Box)

No Trades taken because of market weakness - (Neutral. Yellow Circle)

Back to a Bear Market, shorting! (Last Red Circle)

This is all in the span of 1 market day...

Theory is, if trend reverses, we will be able to cost average in the lowest losers and help to minimize risk while directionally profiting...Not being stuck Long in Overbought Territory or Short in Oversold.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
In the case of EURJPY...

Red - Bear Market.

Yellow - Neutral - No Trades Taken

Red - Resume Bear Trend - Trade directionally.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Have some ideas that I've been working on this week that I will try to write into the code for the up and coming...

Trend Detection - Keeping on the good side of the trend and still away from buying tops and selling bottoms.

Trend Weakness Detection - Less Aggressive Strategy for cost averaging when trend changes.

Additional Closing Patterns - In Trend and Out of Trend.

We've seen the Evolution...

TIME FOR THE REVOLUTION!!

I have been forward testing the lost socks on the E/U with great success so far....... I will put the results up after I get a little more time on it.

I started the forward test on Jan 24 and up till today Feb-9 - its $533.00 in profit.  this is with 0.1 lot setting. 2K account start size.   1.66% draw down.

Now I manually intervene on Fridays to stop the EA and try to do this when all trades are closed or I will close all trades hopefully with little loss. I then start the EA on Sun before the market open. Magix - Any suggestions on the manual intervention or how you like to run your EAs would be helpful.

Most all EAs I have tested have been a waste of time but I am a gadget kind of guy and will play around.  I am very impressed with lost socks for it does some trick sh1t.  I have figured out most of it but sometimes it surprises me with unexpected trading. Thanks for putting up some of the logic behind the EA for this is very help full for a virgin like me.  I will post more on my forward testing later on. Thanks for a very quality EA Much Appreciated.  Regards.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
A couple of things to add on...

Directionally speaking, I do choose "Only Long" or "Only Short", based on my own ideas of market...this helps the DD on closing all trades on Friday...(LIVE ACCOUNT)

Revolution should eliminate the need for this...SHOULD!

Thanks to all who remembered my birthday and for the well wishes - Truly Shocked at the emails!!

And, not sure if I punctuated this properly...so will say it again...

TIME FOR THE MOTHERFUCKING REVOLUTION!!

Well, I was going to start this post differently but Happy Birthday! May you live long and prosper in great health, I would have sang but no need to scare anyone away, eyh? )))

While sifting through the "My order' trades I just discovered several "Lost Sock" ones..... interesting. What are they for? How did they get lost? And who's going to tumble dry them off?

EA is in 14$ profit, DD was at one time 25$, still don't have a dedicated demo account for it and I switched to 5 Pip Brick size as the 1 Pip was killing my PC.

I was watching the trades and for the life of me, I can't understand the sitting out jumping in logic of things. Right now it's selling in what looks like a local bottom so I'm intrigued, of course

Thanks for this little toy.

Dude,

With each passing year, I come to appreciate the following even more!
Sing like no one is listening.
Love like you’ve never been hurt.
Dance like nobody’s watching,
and live like it’s heaven on earth.

Short, fat and bald!

Besides being average at pretty much all physical attributes, those have been my "redeeming qualities"!

Over the last year, I've dropped 70 LBS.

Went from "Couldn't do 3 push-ups" to "I do 120 per day".

As an old fart, with the most beautiful grandaughter ever in my life, I have come to appreciate that we are more than what we think others see in us.

She is my inspiration...

==================================

Onward HO!

The triggering is based on time, space, direction and counter direction. It was originally written for an M1 chart in the predecessor versions...if it makes no sense now as applied to renko, that's understandable.

Whenever I go through any idea - Charting Wise - I try to think of the patterns to my immediate logic. Fast and Furious!

Applying range or renko or even different time frames, doesn't always come into effect.

So...to look at anything out of context and try to make sense, will never make sense.

Now...

That being said, I think subsequent version(s) will be a lot more applicable to anything and everything outside of my standard logic.

Movement is movement and focusing on THAT is what I have been missing.

No promises...of course...but I believe that, after the Birthday beers of this weekend fade, I will be able to throw something together to have a lot more of it make sense in all relevant views.

==================================

From here and as applied to your PC resources...

TMA + CG is a HUGE and HEAVY indicator.

Remove that fucker from your charts, any and all, and you will drastically remove the strain on your PC.

==================================

hi magix bro, hope your good

good to see you back, its been a while since falling knives!

just had a question in regards to these systems. obviously a big problem is strong trends and large DD and obviously you're aware of that as well as others who code these EA's. My question is, how come no one seems to have implemented good hedge functions into these programs in case you do become a victim of a strong trend? Is it because of US rules that don't allow it?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I'm feeling ya on the trading thing.

Love this FUCKING GAME!!

Not quite like Bruce Lee...but getting better.

Goal is to do 100 regular and 100 raised...trying to be as handsome as I can be.

Since I was sick a few years back, I've spent copious amounts of time to studying the human anatomy, diets, body, muscles, supplements...fascinating shit!

Self cured my issues...started feeling better...actually in the best shape of my life!

And can still HAMMER BACK THE BEER!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hey Bgntrs, nice to see you still around!

&&

Great Question, dude!

I've worked on many ideas around the hedging concept, but all have come up short!

The "Drag the Dead" was probably the most creative I got on this front, but even with that, it requires a fucking HUGE account and significant amounts of trades that can exceed the MT4 threshold to fully work out.

The issue is...it's hard to actually identify when the trend will kick in full stop...most of the market is chop.

That being said...keeping to the right side and profiting bi-directionally - as Lost Socks Does - while chipping away at the worst positions in countertrending, observing trend weakness, has been distinctly better than all predecessors and much the reason that I am working with Voldermars Core Code.  His Code is SOLID, just the initial triggering logic was not that good.

Modifications allow me to set the primarys in trend, follow trend and hold off on triggering when the trend changes until there is directional weakness.

I have added a BASE trend filter to the existing trader and have tightened up on the primary triggering.

Additionally, it is still a TRIGGER ON TREND trader - meaning that it doesn't just observe the standard grid, but also waits for a directional bias.

AND

What we know about market is...when the trend changes, there's always a chance for escape - unless buying absolute tops and selling absolute bottoms.

What I've done to help eliminate the risk on these is set in an OBOS filter.

So...what we have is a Trend following Grid that waits for opportunity, recognizes market weakness, will cost average in appropriately, close out the worst position when others are in profit and has multiple closing logic to maximize all.

Truly, this is the sum of all of my best ideas compiled into a kick-ass core!

The new mods will need to be tested properly because by minimizing risk and throttling back on aggression I know that it will limit profitability, but I also want to make sure that it still has the ability to be as effective in cost averaging out the losers.

Make sense?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
All this being said...

And as much as I encourage others to "NOT SHOW ME BACKTEST REPORTS", I have been watching the trading logic work through on these and have had a few bug fixes...

No, I don't consider the backtest reports - especially as applicable to what they show in an equity curve to be accurate - I have loosened up on the "In-Trend" triggers after tightening them - based on equity reports - and have Tightened up on the "Trend Weakness" Cost Averaging - again based on equity reports.

Thing is...

When I first started all of this learning to code shit...I had worked with a number of ideas - Primary and Still Standing today - Trigger on Grid.

I THREW AWAY a lot of ideas, based on their failures in the Backtest reports in MT4 and was honestly ready to Throw in the Towel on this whole EA BULLSHIT!!

If wasn't for member - Darkforce - Doubling a LIVE 10K account with one of my codes, I would have given this shit up - YEARS AGO!!

It's still hobby and I still churn some cash from this, but the idea is to make a better mouse trap.

Create an EA that can be effective and consistent, while requiring a lot less capital than 10K in.

The bulk of my initial accounts were $10K, dropped to $5k, then to $3K and now I believe that I can show and produce effective and consistent growth with Under $2.

Why?

I'd rather have 5 accounts with different brokers churning bank than to have all eggs in one basket with a lot of risk...

It's a thing....

--- 帖子 #54 ---
totally makes sense dude.

I have to say your EAs are pretty awesome. I remember running one of your lost sock versions probably around a year ago and was amazed then even at the cost averaging, trigger prevention in strong trends etc. Although we would have a bit of DD, it recovered every time! Even if took some days, it still recovered never the less.

I've been looking at what ideas others have in regards to hedging when a strong trend comes along. tbh, most of them are crap. lol.

With your EA, with a big enough starting capital, a hedge isn't really needed thanks to the amazing way it works.

I guess what makes me weary and most others is the DD.  I guess a hedging implementation would allow people to sleep a little easier. I do have a detailed hedging idea btw, if you're interested drop me your email I can send it over.

Looking forward to playing with the latest version of lost socks!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Bottom line...

There will most definitely be a few versions of REVOLUTION before I have a final.

I am somewhat limited to capacity in that I still need to shake a few personal shekkles to keep this shit viable, meaning I have to keep my live accounts running as well as the testers.

I do have a few version that I run and won't release because of the general NEWBIE ignorance.

A lot of time is committed to when to trade and when not to...a lot of ideas have been compiled and are running that can't be the 24/7 or just turned off and on when you think...it's a pretty big deal and as best as I can, don't always get it right and end up chewing off an arm to save the body.

Will test and progress.

I may take you up on this.

Biggest considerations are;

1.  We reduce the risk to a Blue Moon Trader - and scarcely profit - no fun in that.

2.  We create something that limits the number of pairs by having too many trades on multiple pairs - much the issue with the "Drag the Dead".

Maybe I should be crowdfunding this shit to help me progress...

You'll be amazed with some of the hilarious crowdfunding campaigns out there. A robot that makes you money is worth a try...

Fuck!

I Should crowdfund off the posted version then!

Definitely not selling off another version...got burned huge on the last one...don't even want to talk about it!

Here's the funny thing...

I started writing code in elementary...on a computer that was paid for by - Get This - collecting bottles for our school.

I raised more than any other individual, and got extra time on the machine!

Yeah, cuz that was kewl and important!

Green dots on a black screen made everything that much better!!

Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarge GAP!!

And a VERY IMPORTANT NOTE TO ALL OF YOU!!

I can't code myself out of a wet paper bag!

I'm a total fucking coding MORON!!!

The reason I chose to use a CODE CORE by Voldemar is because I don't have the ability to create my own engine...True Story!

Most of you, already know this..but for the rest...

C'Mon...

What the fuck is holding you back???

Look at the equity curve attached to this thread. Don't believe it's possible???

Run the fucking EA attached!!

LEAVE IT AT DEFAULT!!!

That's what I've done!

And, again, I am a coding MORON!!

GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER!!

lol

Or...

Watch out for my crowdfund!

Disclaimer....

I have been fortunate enough to work with some of the greatest minds in the MT4 world...

Reason being...

I've committed the time to them and their ideas.

Off of that, I have a library of my own source that I can tap into...

Seriously.

When you look at the metaeditor and haven't a fucking clue what it says...look again!

The true note...I can trade and do.

I am a fast frame trader, mostly because my attention span is still, that of a Gnat!

If I can do this shit, and again, look at the attached account and equity curve...

SO CAN YOU!

Learning coding for me has - is a bitch

Like the challenge of it -- I am a pretty good steel this and that and past in this and stolen that

but that's about it.... I take my hat off to anyone that codes clean.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Ditto that!!

Again, being a fucking MORON, it's hard to see what everything says and does, and that is the primary reason for using the Backtest feature of MT4.

Now...before I really got into this shit, and others actually seeing what I am doing as being effective...I could still read basic code and understand what it is saying...as can anybody...

Really...

IF...AND...Then

If something happens, take a trade...if trigger out, close the trade.

That's really the basics of most EA's.

Where it gets a little deeper is if you are working with cost averaging EAs, because you have a primary trigger and fucking then what?

When do you add?

When do you exit?

Take this and a throw in key words like Neural or Grid and now you have an idea that, because these were greatly profitable once upon a time and show up in Google top hits, this is the KEY TO MARKET!

It ain't!

Any periodical or grid trader will work...once in a while and depending on time frame and range, can work even longer.

Again, I steer back to Darkforce - where he doubled a $10k live account - eventually made several times that - by working with actual "Logic" instead of "Luck".

Luck can make a week.  But can't make a month.

Logic can hold a week in balance while the month makes profit.

A basic understanding of coding while a greater understanding of market is how this shit actually gets done.

Start from an idea...and work the rest of that shit out.

If we are in trend:  Then What?

If we are out of trend:  Then What?

Market is a steady stream of If Than, Then what?

Take core...I have posted the EXACT SAME CORE that runs in this thread to post 1, and create your own "if than, then what".

I do get it...

Not easy for everybody or anybody for that matter...for those that can, will...for those that can't??

CROWDFUND!!

I started into auto trading with the following:

1.  Download EA.

2.  Run EA.

3.  Lose account.

4.  Download another EA, go back to point 1.

From there, I tried to find an EA that would mimic my profitable trading system and got close...

Contacted the seller and paid to have them make the changes!

JACKPOT, right?

WRONG!!

Typically speaking...

And nothing taking away from the coding gurus of this or any other forum...

They Know the Code - But don't take well to the translation of your speak to code speak.

Much the reason that there are probably more EAs than are actual market traders...

Seriously speaking, I have created code for over 3000 EAs...most of which are shit.

I use 7.

What does that tell you?

Even in my own words, when I tried to spell it out in code speak to logic, I couldn't get it right.

If you tell that to somebody else, what fucking chance do they have at getting it correct?

Less than ZERO!

Next...

When you look at a chart, you have to appreciate that EVERY indicator repaints...YUP...they all do.

And...when you add to this, where you think you are taking the trigger to actually where a trigger happens, it's a very different ballgame!

Take any Moving Average Cross System...and these really are my bread and butter...

If x crosses above y, go long.

If x crosses below y, go short.

When you look at a chart, they make sense...

UNTIL!!

You notice where your first opportunity if to take these trades actually is...

[spoiler alert] They are laggy and aren't as profitable as you'd think...

So you move on to skipping the gun...and find out how many false signals you get...

And then you grind...and find out how worthless a generic grid actually is...

And then you come to me with a trigger on grid and shit actually starts to make sense.

Ya see...

Any martingale system that is in the top 10 right now, is 5 years away from where I am right now.

How do I know?

This is where I was 5 years ago and these guys are still looking in the same boxes.

It will be expensive...

Most of them WILL NOT SURVIVE...

And

The ones that do, won't ever use an EA again.

Been around this for a while.

Trends are trends and not just in market, but with the FF population count.

Check it...

Go through my subscription list - people that subscribe to me - Check out their activity.

Best guess - Their length of time in activity closely mimics their market activity time and I would conservablu guess that half of my subs have been market dead for the last 5 years.

BAD??

Fuck Yeah it is...

But you are hear reading it, so you've made it past that.

Be weary...be wise!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Proof is in the pudding!

Find that coder mladden - He wrote the code for my primary triggering for this EA.

Check out his posts...

Seriously!

He is embarrassed about this code because after failing to use it and work with it profitably, he discourages EVERYBODY away from using.

Now...

Look at the equity curve attached to thread.

This motherfucker goes STRAIGHT UP!

What's that tell you?

Code is shit?

or

Coder doesn't understand the value of his code??

Proof in the pudding...

I'd bet money, marbles or chalk that I could "Trigger on Grid" almost any idea into profitability!

And I'm a fucking MORON!

lol

GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!!

WELP!!!

You've called me out...appropriately so.

Really had no plan...and in fact, I've kinda worked against my own efforts:

1.  Attached to post 1 - Source code - CORE - of what I'm actually working with.

2.  I have acknowledged the fact that I am a coding moron!

3.  With all previous information on trading attached, including source, everybody/anybody should be able to create their own better version of the mouse trap.

4.  Already acknowledged the fact that I have absolutely no intention of selling code...

Kinda leaves me with market knowledge and people that want to see what I can do.

So...reasonably speaking...

$1000 to get me some gear...works out to about $5/head until I get goal or...

A little more for those who want source.

Not really sure at this point.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Also forgot...

5.  Anybody with $2k in their account can actually churn $250/wk with the ea posted at default.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Not to mention, lastly...

6.  The Default version of this EA is better than 90% of open market traders, probably better than 95% of Forexfactory traders...

Would be better if everybody knew if/when there was a deadline date.

From images on page 1 i can see this ea to be similar to QLT (quantum london trading) eas. At least the part where you make multiple buy entries on down spikes and wait for price to go back up so that multiple orders average on positive side and you close in profit.

What i didn't like about QLT is that all EAs were built that when it opens sell grid it keeps opening sell positions until that single basket end in profit or kill account and in the meantime losing great amount of "short term" small grids that could end up being positive.

Me personally have tried to program this kind of EA that would open multiple grids on shorter term and close them on regular basis thus taking adventage of those opportunities but unfortunatelly MQL is pain in the ass and head to work on, and after some positive progress I gave it up.

Now when I saw the images I instantly remember my struggle with codes and how to organize different "baskets" and keep track of them, and nonsense with mql and arrays and cant pass array as function parameter and cant display any data with ease and aghhh i still hate it.

Since trend can be deadly for this type of EA, Ive tried to develop trend friendly ea that would follow same logic but with bias toward trend direction, but i couldnt detect trend properly and i ended up backtesting in trendy areas where it performed good.

Closing basket of orders on proper price seem to be challenging part as well. Most of the time when I close basket in profit looks like if i left it open for a little longer profit could be significantly higher (since basket consists of multiple orders).

Overall, i love the idea, and to me looks like great way to turn odds in your favor, will have deeper look into it tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Great post, dude.

You seem to be overcomplicating things, but I admire your committment!

Look forward to seeing your analysis of the running EA.

This is one of the things selected code helps tp eliminate...

Most of the time when I close basket in profit looks like if i left it open for a little longer profit could be significantly higher (since basket consists of multiple orders)

We aren't looking for price nor specific movement...just looking for an opportunity to take profit in the same way we look for opportunity to take a trade or cost average.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Honestly, was thinking about the same range...

Really...for the number of copies that get downloaded and actually used, this would help immensely.

Keeping in mind, my first Christmas EA raised over $5k towards charity...a crowdfund doing the same would speed things up proportionally!

On the subject of health...

With Exception of Malnutrition, there is almost no disease that the human body can't cure by itself With the assistance of Fasting.

We chronically look for things to put into our bodies, pills and potions, when in fact all we need to do in a lot of cases, is take away everything!

Very Kewl Shit!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Agree, regular fasting is beneficial to our health.

Are you practising the regular fasting now?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
It all depends on the triggering, I think, especially when using the original brainz as a core engine.

I'm trading it on a 1.2K demo account on one pair only, albeit on Renko, it's churning in profits, very small ones but keeps DD larger than the cumulative profits.

I think the 250$ may very well be dependent on the number of pairs thie EA is attached to.

You're running it on multiple pairs, what if there's a rally, even a short one but all over the board? On multiple pairs I can see this accumulating a bit of a DD before it manages to compensate.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Kicked off the year with a 4 day water fast followed by the Month of January, 1 Meal/day - Intermittent Fasting Program.

This helped shed about 20 pounds of the 70 total.

Plan on doing a 5 day water fast per quarter...just to keep things in check.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
That's definitely part of the key - Number of pairs in trade for profitability and this is also definitely part of the risk.

The aim is - Reduce the Risk and watch for pairs that can add into the overall profitability.

I've always kept to core pairs - GBPUSD, GBPJPY, GBPAUD, EURUSD, EURJPY, EURAUD, AUDUSD as these seem to be the pairs that have a personality to play well in my sandboxes...but that's not to say that this logic cannot be expanded or kept inside of single pairs for smaller accounts and risk factor.

TMAV1 - went close to 6 months before accumulating trades and accumulated DD before hitting respective stop loss - $1000/pair - on 2 pairs - SAME DAY!

The idea of working with Voldemars CORE - is that it will take out the worst trade position in accumulate profits and will continue to take profit on smaller sets instead of waiting for all to close.  This is a HUGE part of how this beast should work out better than all other predecessors as a set and forget...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Difference in the Traders...

The original version and the Lost_Sock_E version.

Same Pair in trade - I pulled them up on a Longer Time Frame to make viewing of the trades easier for reference.

The LSE version - Whittled away at the worst positions taken from the same date - January 31st and closed off in (from what I can see) 9 separate batches. This will have increased the profitability while reducing the risk by slowly killing off the deadwood. (Chart 1)

The original required total balance to be above zero for closing and ended up closing trades from January 31st today. (Chart 2)

Hi Magix

l am following your thread since few days... Have downloaded ea during the weekend now it is running...looking great on demo...l am agree for crowdfunding if ea is really viable live…

The only downside l can see until now is not drawdown itself but margin call...have already 23 trades running on 8 currencies...

Based on my broker live margin request...let's say an average 40$/trade/ ,01lot... 920$ might be on margin now against 44$ DD...

Are you really running it live? How do you manage margin then?

By the way thanks for your dedication…

This ea remains me this one by his behaviour : https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/18475

l have tested it for months on demo...was amazing on paper money... But not realistic live...Because any never-ending trend would kill the account...If the DD it-self don't kill it... margin call will do because the increasing number of openned position over the time...Unless you have a very very large account…

Do believe that comment applies to yours too...

Let me know your opinion about this concern...

Have a nice day

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hey Ben,

I have and do run my traders on live funds - though I do have some manual interjections on Live where I trypically leave the Demo accounts play out 100% Auto (I like to see the difference in these).

I play with a few different accounts with my EAs - again - Not all have been published for public use - toggling between logic on some of these, others with a larger account size, will keep with the higher risk, while keeping some of my lower risk on smaller accounts.  Currently, I am only trading with one broker 500:1.  Margin requirements - since I've been playing with the latest few versions haven't exceeded $200 - while I have on my live accounts seen as high as $1200 in DD...yup...it gets up there...much the reason for working to improve the logic.

On one of my live accounts - overnight, I started playing with the Newest - unreleased version - Revolution.  Given the market range overnight and due to filtering - it's only taken a fist full of trades, not a whole lot of profit, but pretty close to what is available on the TE HERE .

--- 帖子 #95 ---
A basket of "My Order" was just closed, while DD was a bit too much to look at (not in terms of currency but percentage) this beast is banking up slowly but surely.

Man, I need to get a dedicated demo account for it so I can do better analysis on it, not sure the DD would be that much isolated from other trades I'm currently running on my demo account.

Anyways, I'm very pleased this one doesn't take entries blindly, I also like the closure of trades along the way, re-washing the Lost Sock(s) is turning into a very interesting idea come to life once you get to watch it do its work.

Since I'd like to run the EA head to head on both Renko and regular charts, can you confirm the MagicNumber in user settings is what's being used for both My Order and Lost Sock trades?

This is fun!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Missed changing one of the trade comments as I typically don't really look at this as my test accounts are dedicated...

What you will notice is that all long positions taken by LSE will have trade comment - Lost Sock, while Shorts should have trade comment - My order.

Magic Number is a user variable - Default - 69 - this is what your terminal will view when the logic is looking to close orders.  Change the magic number between Renko and Non-Renko and you should be able to track these with myfxbook - I believe they still have order number tracking...

Straight up random post here - on Pushups!

Grinding these motherfuckers out daily, as mostly my primary and sometimes only workout of the day, ROCKS!

That being said...I fucking hated these when I first started...

Was going through these in the summer - Did my first 100 - took a number of tries to complete the whole 100 and for the next week, I could barely lift my arms!

w0wserz!

I picked up after another week - doing the wussy style/girl/knee or half pushups...was grinding these out and managed to get a little better at them and could complete 100 working back to back with pushups and crunches - would match push up to crunches until I would hit my 100...

Over the last few weeks, starting these back up, and probably because I've dropped considerable weight...they got to be a lot easier.

Part of this is due to the Fasting and Intermittent Fasting that I was doing.

When you fast - and if you are in a state of ketosis - one of the largest benefits is a MAJOR reduction in inflammation.  Meaning...you don't feel the same pains for as long.  Whether it be from physical activity or arthritic/wound-related issues - the pain is a lot less...

Anyways...

One of the other big things in my improvement for the pushup angle...is proper form.

I used to start in an upright position - body elevated.  One of the biggest things I found from this is there is a lot of inconsistency when comes to where I would end up...sometimes hands were further ahead, sometimes behind...rarely did I get them exact from set to set...

So now...proper form...hands are supposed to be shoulder-width apart - I start off laying on my belly, placing my hands at my shoulders and use this as a primary start.  Now that I've done this, more consistency and overall easier sets...

Not telling anybody to do this...more just a random thought to help cut up the day.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi Magix

sir i was used your past EA stome  in my live Account, so can i use Lost Sock Evolution EA in Live Account ??????

--- 帖子 #99 ---
You sure can...

There are a couple of coding issues with the current version, that don't affect the performance.

Besides that, the default settings on the posted version is exactly what is trading in the attached TE on an M1 chart - No passwords, not expiry date - WIDE OPEN DEMO and LIVE account trading.

*Note - get familiar with the amount of DD for the size of account you would like to unleash this on, check out the trade stats in the attached Trade Explorer to see possible profitability - Note the broker used for Margin 500:1 - you do NOT need to have an account with Tickmill, just as long as your account is in the same or similar standings.

Thanks to Ben for raising the Account Margin concerns.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Nice work Magix!

I've read everything, and I'm really intrigued by this strategy. I've opened a demo account to run this separately from my other things I have, and see what it can do.

I have however only opened it on 5 pairs as I think the more pairs running simultaneously can increase the DD considerably. I'm keen to see what this EA will do.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
\m/

Rock on, dude!

Let me know if you are interested in sharing some information from your TE - Demo test account.

I will put it up on the first post - with anybody else - currently only Energetic is up for comparison.

The more information, especially on pairs that I don't have included in my testing, the better understanding we all have.

SQUEEZE YOUR GLUTES!

I don't even remember how many times I've seen this posted or watched in on youtube...

Dafuq does that even mean??

My hands and feet are pressed to the floor, giving up all of the energy I have to just keep myself from getting a fucking nose bleed and there's more?

Yeah...this can be both hard, trying to get your head into this game and easier once you've got going.

What does it mean?

Just means, pinch your ass cheeks together.  Best way I heard it described, squeeze in your ass like you are holding a pencil between your buttcheeks.

Fucking ooooooooooooooooooooohhhhh!!

Now...hopefully, you got the same visual I did, in that you are holding the pencil parallel to you, because...well...perpendicular means that you are trying to well...let's just not go there.

Make it easier...keep your feet close together (as you are getting used to this) - get into your proper form - starting off on your belly, hands shoulder width apart, SQUEEZE your GLUTES, and push like you want to not get a fucking nose bleed!

w00t!

Again...I'm not trying to tell you to do this, but really, whatchu got to lose?

I did state that I had to start off with the "Wussy" pushups, but hey...if you are the same, there's no fucking shame in that!

Doing anything to better yourself isn't anything to be ashamed of...especially if you have some physical issues that you want to overcome, or if you simply want to do pushups - LIKE BRUCE LEE!

A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first steps.

This fucking guy...

I get it that the world is built of many different people...but in a trading forum, there are few more worthless than this fucking shithead!

In the years that I've been here...admittedly, I don't read every post...this guy posts as little as trade-related as possible and when he does, it's all fucking negative.

This latest attempt, at a time suck or clickbait thread, is about as fucking morbid as morbid gets!

Yeah...shit always don't work out your way and a lot of us who've been round for a while have seen the threads or posts of desperate traders wanting to end their existence...shit, maybe some of us have even wanted to be there...but to suss it out?

Are you fucking kidding me?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
So...what is all this code shit and how does it even work??

Inserted Code  if(TypeOrders==Only_BUY || TypeOrders==Only_All)
if((b==0) || (b>0 && (BuyMinPrice-Ask)>=BuyDist) || ((b>0 && (Ask-BuyMaxPrice)>=BuyDist) && TradeTrend==On))
if(OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,NormalizeDouble(buylot,2),NormalizeDouble(Ask,Digits()),Slippage,0,0,"My order",Magic,0,clrGreen)<0)
Print(" Error open Buy N ",GetLastError());

Now...every coder has their own stylings - to be sure - and I can't really say that any of them are wrong...really, doesn't matter if they are as long as you can get shit to work.

So...let's have a looksie at the attached CORE of Lost Socks and see if we can't make a little sense of it.

Inserted Code if(TypeOrders==Only_BUY || TypeOrders==Only_All)
First line of actuall triggering code - obviously related to "Buy"'s.

Really, if you look at it, you can see that the code basically says, if you have selected Only Buys or All - Meaning you haven't selected only sells - you want to take buy orders.  Pretty fucking basic...right?

Let's move along:
Inserted Code    if((b==0) ||
If b==0, I'm sure I don't need to explain this, or the reason it can fail - that's been covered - but if there are no buys and according to the line above, buys are not excluded from trading...automatically take a trade!!

SHAZAM!

Run the core code, during live market and you will see that the first thing it does is load one buy and one sell to your account...well, fuck...didn't really want that, but ya get it...right?

After that, there's this "||".

Dafuqs that mean?

Well, its basically saying "or"....

Will come back to it!

Next up:
Inserted Code (b>0 && (BuyMinPrice-Ask)>=BuyDist)
b>0...hrmmm...so..if buys before were zero or equal to zero and the or sign comes into effect, and we are now looking at we already have a trade in play, what's the next steps...comes this:
Inserted Code && (BuyMinPrice-Ask)>=BuyDist
&& obviously is a "Must Include Criteria", like when you go to McDonald's...you order a #(Whatthefuckever), it implies that fries and a soft drink Must Be Included.

Aight...

Next up - (BuyMinPrice-Ask)>=BuyDist

HERE's Your Grid!!

This is a standard grid and on the EA - User Parameters allow you to set BuyDist...the distance between the first trade taken, and the following subsequent trades.

w0w...that was easy, right?

We take a trade, set a minimim distribution range and additional and subsequent trades are taken if they meet with the "Fries are Implied", logic.

Now...the main issue that I found with this idea - Same as ALL GRID TRADERS - is that they just assume price will come back inside of the close logic (will cover later) to make profit.  Again...not an unreasonable idea - given that market chops more than trends...so what's the issue?

Well...ya gotta run this motherfucker to figure that out and this is one of them times it is OK to use the Strategy Tester - But STILL NOT A GOOD IDEA TO POST THE RESULTS IN MY THREAD!!

See what this fucker is doing and ask yourself:

1.  Did we really want to take a buy/sell when we activated this trader?

2.  Did we really want to just blindly add another trade - X Pips Away?

The answer to both of these, obviously, NO!  But if you don't watch it happen, can you really understand what it is doing??

Okay...so...you run the strategy tester - you place on your favorite template that matches with your idea of trades and you get an idea!

We don't just want to take a Blind Opening Trade for shitz n gigglez...we don't just want to add in blindly at X pips...but what we want to do is wait for (?????)

Now...run the LSE in your strategy tester...go ahead...it's okay.

And you will see that we don't Automatically open a primary trade and if that trade is open, don't necessarily ADD in more trades at X number of pips.

Why??

Well, I've told this motherfucker to SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW DOWN!!!

Take some time...

Analyze the Market!!

And...if all is good, take a Primary Trade or Add to the existing trade, but do it when there is a Minimum Distance (Grid) between current and last trade AND - Wait for a trigger.

This - is what I have coined and for the most part, am the only one working - TRIGGER ON GRID!

Meaning that not only do we require a grid, we also need confirmation.

But what about the TREND, you ask??

GREAT FUCKING QUESTION!

Glad you are paying attention!!

Into our primary trigger, we can tell it what to look for.  ie, if current price is ABOVE X Moving Average - Trend is Long, and then define our trigger from there.

From there, we ADD in our TRIGGER ON GRID strategy and say, if price is X pips away, and CCI/RSI is Above/Below (XXX) then, take another trade.
(this is just an example - if you've tested LSE, you will know that CCI nor RSI are a part of what is being used, because they don't show up on the Strat Test Chart.)

Once you've written in your Primary Trigger for Long and Subsequent trigger to Trigger on Grid, do the converse for the Next Set of Code to follow which looks like:
Inserted Code    if(TypeOrders==Only_SELL || TypeOrders==Only_All)
if((s==0) || (s>0 && (Bid-SellMaxPrice)>=SellDist) || ((s>0 && (SellMinPrice-Bid)>=SellDist) && TradeTrend==On))
if(OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,NormalizeDouble(sellot,2),NormalizeDouble(Bid,Digits()),Slippage,0,0,"My order",Magic,0,clrGreen)<0)
Print(" Error open Sell N ",GetLastError());

Notice the similarities in these - as it is a Grid Trader - All trade logic, should be the same.

If s==0, if s>0, &&.......

Write in your code...

Test it in the Strat Tester...

If all looks good...

FIRE THIS MOTHERFUCKER UP on a DEMO ACCOUNT and see how it works.

TADA!!

You are now a GRAND WIZARD OF EA's!!

Pat your self on the back and go buy a new car!

Or not...

Ya know...if it was just that easy, everybody would do it, this would change the face of market and Nobody would make money...but that doesn't mean that your idea won't work...put the fucker to test!!

GRIND THAT SHIT OUT!

And...if you have issues ->GO HERE !

[/Scratching Head]...

It's a lot easier once you've had a chance to fuck around with this...honestly it is...

So...let's go over a couple more things...

Inserted Code If (b==0)

This really is the first place to start...otherwise, you will always open this fucker up and automatically have trades in play.

Now...this may not all be bad...if the trend is long - according to your idea of market - and you select Only Long in the terminal, you are manually interjecting and taking some control, so - not all lost...

BUT!!

If you want an actual trigger or trend in play...how to add??

Inserted Code &&

Oh yeah!!

So -  Inserted Code If (b == 0&& Add your idea in here!
You get to pick where you've set your primary Trigger!!

w00t!

Maybe...you want to set in a Price - Like Supply and Demand Trading - oooooooooooooooooooooh! wouldn' that be kewl!!

If (b==0&& Bid is <= XXXXX) - whoa!

or...

Candle Based:

if (b==0&& Close[1]>Open[1]) <- trigger based on a bullish candle - Close is greater than Open, we have a Bull.  Close < Open, we have a Bear.

or...

Indicator Based:

if (b==0 and iCCI(NULL,0,24,PRICE_CLOSE,0)<-100)....

TADA!!

You are now a GRAND WIZARD OF EA's!!

Pat yourself on the back and go buy a new car!

Or Not...

Fucken sure seems like a lot of work, hey??

Especially, if you are like me and really don't have any sort of programming background - psept if you collected bottles in Grade 2 and got to work on an Apple IIe, like I did!

lol

You've probably already got a few EAs - .mq4 files in your terminal that you've played with already...

Crack them fuckers open.

See where there logic is!

And now that you know how to use these to add a primary trigger - by adding the &&, and now that you know you can grid these motherfuckers by adding the &&...time to giver a whirl!

Really...it's kind of like the pushup thing without the confusion of the angle of the pencil being squeezed between your buttcheeks!

Booyeah!

NIACIN!!

WHEW!

Ever take this shit?

Then you KNOW what the flush is ALL ABOUT!

Fuck Yeah!

Feels like the worst sunburn of your life for a good half hour!

Drop one of these motherfuckers and get a cold shower ready...

In getting back to better health, one of my Favorite Supplements is Niacin!

Does some pretty amazing stuff in the body, mostly, I take it to help me stay in Ketosis and get the best out of my Fat Burning. There is an After Burn Effect in taking Niacin, so I drop a few of these bombs before I hit the sheets...now, for the most part, I am adapted - meaning, I take enough of this shit to not have that horrible flushing effect of Niacin, but will take some time away occasionally, just to Feel the BURN!

So...

Maybe you are getting on in age - I'm there...I get it...

Things - at night with the Mrs. - ain't what they used to be - been there too...in fact, this is what it really took for me to realize I had some serious issues.

No...the chronic pain, vomiting and diarrhea weren't enough...it's when, ya know, things below weren't working like they used to...

Gunna save you some awkward reading here and just say...Niacin helps get things moving along again.

Increase in GH, reduction of LDL, Anti-Inflammatory, helps with Poor Circulation, Fatigue and Depression.

What's not to love about that??

THE FLUSH!

AGAIN...that takes some time to get used to and if you take it properly, you can be adapted in a DAY to this effect.

Why am I talking about this?

Just dropped a couple, haven't had any since Friday and I am not as adapted as I was...WOWZERZ!

There's a few more things I do add to my daily supplement rituals, all under the idea of Longevity, but hey...why would you want to live longer, if you aren't enjoying life??

Up all night, doing what I used to do...all night!

??

Ever heard of Prolactin?

It's a hormone produced by the body, secreted by the pituitary gland, in response to eating, mating, estrogen treatment, ovulation and nursing...now...if you're a dude, a couple of these, probably don't apply as much...but as the time is ticking away, one thing does...

Response to Mating!

Up all night, doing what I used to do...all night!

So...you've gone hard for 4 and half minutes and you are burned out and well...not ready for round 2...how does this even happen?

It's not that you aren't mentally ready, nor want to go, because, well...if you are married, opportunity just don't come round as often.

Kinda goes along with an old joke...

Q:  What food, when given to a woman, will prevent her from having sex?

A:  Wedding Cake!

Alright...it's a joke...don't go getting all offended and let's not lose track of the post...

Prolactin!

As you get older, you produce less dopamine while your prolactin levels - when stimulated - don't taper the same.  This results in what is known as the "Refractory Period", applied to that private time with you and your partner.  Once your done, you can just get to a point where getting back going, isn't an option.

Goes like this...

When you have dopamine, you have less prolactin.  When you surge prolactin...you have less dopamine.

Meaning...refractory period!

FUCK!

(Not as literally and more so figuratively)

So...given this time, close to Valentine's and all...as a brother, want you to have the most of your, money well spent on dinner and flowers!

How's that?

Well...you see...along with keeping things going - Niacin - you can take stuffs to help you AMP up your Dopamine which will reduce that whole refractory period.

Yup...Really...

I know what your saying...prolly $45/pill, needs a prescription or is illegal.

Wrong...all accounts.

There is a Natural Substance (I know what you are saying already), that can naturally increase Dopamine and well...give you a better night.

Mucuna Puriens - Also known as cowitch, velvet bean, Werepe, Kara, Agbara...

A lot of the studies behind this are related to Parkinson's, you may remember the movie with Robin Williams where he was hyper feeding patients L-Dopa to get them back mobile...whatever...anyways...Mucuna Puriens contains L-Dopa, a Dopamine Precursor.  Meaning...stack up the Mucuna and increase your dopamine, drop your prolactin and be as active as an 18 year old minimizing the refractory period.

Really?

This Easy?

KINDA!

Along with Niacin and another one of my fav sups, Pine Bark Extract, the 3 work synergistically.

PBE - a non-patented version of pycnogenol - is what I affectionately call "Morning Wood".

If you are old enough to remember what Morning Wood is...welcome aboard to PBE.  You will wake up with a Kick Stand!

It's a FANTASTIC supplement, offering a lot more than waking up with a hardon...google that shit!

So...

Here's what I'm saying...

Instead of being up all night trying to do what you use to stay up all night doing...stay up all night and do what you used to do when you used to stay up, ALL NIGHT!

Niacin + Pine Bark Extract + Mucuna Puriens!

Additional benefits to follow...but in light of the Hallmark Holiday, figured I would litterally - Throw you a bone.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Okay...tell you more about this magical trio of Natural Viagra...

I can do that...

Seriously...if you do this wrong, you will have a REALLY BAD TIME!!

It starts off with the Niacin.

When I say Body Flush and feels like a sunburn...it's kind of played down.

Seriously, you turn into a fucking lobster, get the crack bug itch and are hotter than a firecracker!!

This description is still MILD compared to what you may feel.

And I know you'll want to dick punch me after your first dose...thinking...what sort of sick twisted shit is this anyways??

Dude...I hear ya!

I'm feeling ya!

It's harsh...feels like you may even have a stroke or heart attack...you won't...it's just a little uncomfortable is all...get over it!

It's all for the better.

SO...here's what you do...and, I hope you are working from home, if you try this...

Take your first hit of Niacin, PBE, and Mucuna Puriens before you are ready to shower and wait until you start to feel warm...and then get into the shower.  Don't look in the mirror...don't fuck around, just get into the shower!!

WHEW!!

Made it!

3 Hours Later...take your next Niacin.

WHAT??

Yup...do it.

Because your body is still processing the first batch of this shit, you may feel a little sensation, but certainly not the levels you felt on your first hit!

3 hours later, SAME THING!

By the third dose...you probably won't feel anything and now you are cruising!!

w00t!!

We are now at Hour 12...assuming you've shopped for this shit tomorrow and are starting on VD...

Double down on the PBE and Mucuna Puriens and take your LAST hit of Niacin.

And if you don't send me an email, thanking me for your Valentines Night...your wife probably will!!

Dosage...

Now...everybody is different, but when comes to this shit, overdosing is an impossibility, but that's not saying to GO MAD FUCKING CRAZY!!

I cap all my newts, so have a GRAND understanding of my dosage - within reasonable measures...capping isn't an exact measure by any stretch.

My Dosage:

750mg of Niacin/Hit - Get whatever the pharmacy has...don't matter what size it is, you will feel the burn and will get the effects.

750mg of PBE

750mg of Mucuna Puriens.

Now...about the only thing you may want to cycle, unless you are some sort of sick twisted fucker that likes looking like a beet and feeling sunburnt, is the Mucuna Puriens.  One of the benefits of MP is that it will help boost testosterone and if you are really manning up and doing your pushups, should be a good thing, right?

KINDA!

What happens is, you can start to get too much test and start to break out in ZITS...back, face, forehead...oh yeah...just like you were Juicing!

Don't be all afraid n shit...your not going to RAGE on it...it's just a small side effect and your bodies way of letting you know when to throttle back.

Once you've gone past your first Niacin Adapting day...just take all 4 doses 2 hours before you go to bed.  No need to feel that burning feeling all day and in actuality, this shit will work better when you sleep anyways.

And...were all adults here.

If ya don't get it...don't be shy...ask a question.

I'm far away enough I'm not afraid of being dick punched on the Niacin thing...and old enough to know that we all want to improve one of the best parts of our lives.

I feel ya...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Ahhhhhhhhh...good questions...

FOR HER!!

She's not in the mood anymore...will this help?

KINDA!

Physiologically speaking...as we get on in age...prolactin can play a part in libido for women. For them, it's more of a nurturing hormone so makes them more into cuddle time than does into BOW CHICKA WOW WOW!!

So...can she take the same protocol to help out?

Sure...

Niacin will have the same flushing effect on a woman...make sure you full well explain this otherwise it's you in for the dick punch!

PBE, will help blood flow for a woman's parts, much the same as a man.

Mucuna Puriens will help the Dopamine - similar feeling to what you get from eating chocolate - dopamine being a Reward Sensation...

And the Niacin will help with...how to put this mildly...a lubricating factor.

Besides the overall extra energy you will get from this, there is some mental clarity, help with sleep, increased muscle tone and even some weight loss through appetite suppression.

BUT for the gals, they can use an extra little help in this department and yup, still all legal and OTC and all natural.

Chasteberry.

Also called Vitex.

Should be able to find this, if not at your local market, through Amazon.

This will help be one of the other catalysts in making the Big Impact for your nightly alone time...FOR HER!  Not you dude!

And hey...

If you're checking shit out anyways...wanna lower your estrogen...yeah, dude...that's whats causing your bitch tits...look for DIIM. It's an extract from the Brachia Family - Broccoli, cabbage and sorts...that can help reduce estrogen that you are getting from the beer consumption or shit like using Shampoo or drinking out of a plastic water bottle...

uh huh...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Uh Huh...

No...This isn't something that you can just do when you think you're going to be in the mood...

Sure it may help on Valentine's day, BUT!!

An accumulation over a period of 3 weeks and I tell you what buddy...

You will be all walking around like:

Yes!!

If you have medical issues, it's always best to consult a doctor...

Mucuna Puriens
Niacin
Pine Bark Extract

Given the shit that you are probably already pumping into your body...without knowing how harsh it can be...there's probably no risk to adding some Natural Products, but the standard disclaimer applies...

I'm not a doctor and don't play one on TV...

If you are taking meds, best to check that what you want to add won't conflict with what you are taking!

Hi mrdfx,

in my account it opens positions only with the one indicator of thepackage "LSE..."

I started 1 hour ago my testing. TE will come.

I understood that the template and the other indicators are only to have the "EA´s view".

Hope I am right :-)

Edit: Here Comes the TE

Hey Telac!

Good to see ya around!

That sort of thing, I would say more broker related than EA...I've seen as many as 3 trades entered in on a single candle...sometimes happens at daily roll over but w0w...what you had there looks crazy.

Here's a screenshot of my cable trades from London...don't look much like yours at all.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The only Indicator used from the template is the TMA + CG.  Make sure this is in your Indicators folder, for values to be called on by the EA.

It doesn't have to be loaded on the chart and depending on what you have for resources, prolly better you don't...this is a heavy indicator and can add a lot of drag on your PC.

For the record...Reamasesa is only using unique magic numbers for his because he is using the EA on the same pair, one renko chart and one M1.  Because he doesn't want the logic tripping over itself, it necessitates unique numbers.  Otherwise, not really needed unless you are doing specific tracking per pair on myfxbook.

This is one of the reasons I stick with Tickmill...lots of issues with Demo/Test Accounts not matching to live with other brokers...

I think Pepperstone was the worst, a few years back...not sure how they compare now.

Tickmill is not perfect...but pretty fecking close.

I use Pepperstone for all my demo tests and live trading and their accounts match on spreads and price feed. Never had any issue with them.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
my most off floating is GBP pair like GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, GBP/AUD

--- 帖子 #155 ---
That's part of the logic...

Rather continue trading in the wrong direction, EA will wait for some market directional weakness and look to cost average and close from there.

This helps to reduce risk...

It's good to watch these...gives an understanding of Risk and Lends itself to the ideas that go into the trade system.

More coding talk...

Let's start off with...what is a trigger...

You've had a look at the code, if you wanted too...and now you must decide how to design a Trigger...

I can tell you from experience as being a Coding Fucking Newbie and from having zillions of other people send me their ideas for coding, this is a bit of a beast.

You may think of something simple...like When 12 EMA is above 24 EMA, buy!

This is a simple moving average cross system - the values meaning nothing with except to show one is faster than the other.

Now...when you have a grid based program, what happens is that as long as the fast MA is above the Slower MA, the trigger is ON!

You've created a criteria that is prevelant, for quite likely longer than you want it to be...ie...a quick cross of the Moving Averages...and now you are locked into dogshit!

OH FUCK!!

Wait!!!

It get's worse, because now you are actually gridding this motherfucker!

DOUBLE FUCK!!

Now...the chart I am showing uses the Exponential Moving Averages and also the MACD...why?

Well...it's like this...if MACD is below zero, it shows that the FAST EMA is below the SLOW EMA and converse for FAST ABOVE SLOW - MACD >0.

Just to keep shit simple...if you think that the SMAs will look different...THEY DON'T - they just have different values...

Okay...so look at the chart below, it is a typical chart in a Sideways Market...how are you defining direction?  How are you Taking Profit?

On an M1 Chart...the entire span of this chart is approx 40 pips...and if you look, each Green Arrow is where the Moving Averages Crossed - Green for buys, Red for Sells...

Now...if you gridded these motherfuckers, and seriously pick your direction...you'd MAYBE end up with 2 successful trades.

Oh...I know what you're saying...I'd be playing long...or I'd be playing short...and wouldn't have that issue...

REALLY?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Maybe it's a slower time frame that you'd be looking at?

Again...in a sideways market...you can still be trapped in these ranges...because, well...how do you define the range and what are you looking for in profit?

Think about it...

Next...you may say, I would be in before the arrows...

Okay...HOW?

Until these motherfuckers cross...your logic is already bust!

So when they do Cross - Fast Above Slow for Longs...you are already in a shortened range where profit may not be available.

AND!!

Here's the big thing...if you are defining a "Trigger", you have to define a "Unique Market Criteria".

What?

It's like this...

If on the Previous Bar, the Fast EMA was Less than the Slow EMA and NOW the fast EMA is Greater than the Slow EMA, take a long trigger.

Hrmmmmm...how the fuck ya gunna do this?

Well...it's actually not that tuff, but you need to actually define it...it's not if Fast is above Slow...it's if fast was below slow and is now above...

Look at what the code sees for a Moving Average:

FAST EMA ->  iMA(NULL,0,12,0,MODE_EMA,0,0)

Inserted Code    (NULL)string       [i]symbol[/i],           // symbol
int   (0)             [i]timeframe[/i],        // timeframe
int   (12)            [i]ma_period[/i],        // MA averaging period
int    (0)             [i]ma_shift[/i],         // MA shift
int    (MODE_EMA)     [i]ma_method[/i],        // averaging method
int    (0)            [i]applied_price[/i],    // applied price
int    (0)            [i]shift[/i]             // shift

These are all parameters you can manually set, when you select a Moving Average indicator on your chart.  The biggest thing to pay mind to, is shift.

Kinda...

I mean, your symbol - if NULL selected, means that it is to the current pair, applied to any chart...

0 - for timeframe, means that the Logic is looking to the Applied chart...you could change this and have an M1 chart look at an M5 indicator, but adding in PERIOD_M5...or whatever...

Applied Price - should this be to high or low or to median??

And SHIFT!!

Shift is the period of time the indicator, you are trying to get your code to look at...

So if Shift=0, you are looking at a Moving Candle - It is current to RIGHT NOW!!

if your Shift = 1, it's the candle that has just previously closed.

If Shift = 2, it's the Candle prior to 1, and you keep working back...3, 4, 5, 6, 7.....

--- 帖子 #160 ---
So...how does this come into play??

It's like this...

You Set your Previous Criteria and then your Current Criteria and you have a TRIGGER!!

IF
(previous Fast MA was Lower than Slow MA)  Inserted Code iMA(NULL,0,12,0,MODE_EMA,0,2) < iMA(NULL,0,34,0,MODE_EMA,0,2)   Inserted Code &&
Remember this  &&? It's to add fries and a drink to your Happy Meal...

(current Fast MA is Higher than Slow MA)  Inserted Code iMA(NULL,0,12,0,MODE_EMA,0,1) > iMA(NULL,0,34,0,MODE_EMA,0,1)

We take a buy!!

SHAZAM!!

You're getting this shit!!

AWESOME!!

Alright...

So...as per the previous discussion HERE , who went out and bought some Niacin today??

Raise your hands...don't be shy!!

Or not...whatever...

Valentine's day is tomorrow...and maybe ya gotta work and don't want to go in looking like a Lobster...

Let's do a little planning for tomorrow and make this shit work out!

Tonight...before you are ready for bed...drop a couple of them motherfuckers and as has been mentioned...Get Ready for a COLD SHOWER!!

Why tonight??

Well...again...as mentioned, Niacin will work better while you are sleeping and when you wake up to take your primary dose tomorrow...you will already be partially Adapted!

Oh Man you EA is a money machine lool

Any advises in regards of high impact news ? i mean should you recommend to turn off the ea before

am running 17 pairs . lot : 0.25 heheh (( live ))

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Sorry but I really can't give advise as it seems I'm the only one that had this problem of rapid mass trades during quick market moves. Hopefully it's just a "Demo Account" issue. Love the way this Robot works so hope one day I can go live with it but certainly worry if ICMarkets live accounts work the same way as their demo accounts. I have never had an issue with ICMarkets live account - or demo accounts for that matter until this. I also use Pepperstone and Tickmill - I just find that ICMarkets have tighter spreads and since my VPS is in the same area as their servers the ping time to server is excellent.

My FXBook link, if anyone wants to do some analysis.

So far it looks that the EA on a Renko chart is doing better but it's only two days worth of data so not much to go about with.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Magix,

Could you verify the MagicNumber is set up correctly, please?

I'm not sure why I'm getting these results, the trade reporter was very accurate in the past.

Thanks.

Hey Reamasesa,

I've picked up something peculiar with my TE. I'm running EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, and EURGBP in my test, and since starting on Monday no trades have opened on USDJPY. All is good on the other pairs, and the EA is opening orders, but on UJ nothing.

I'm not sure is this normal Magix? Could it be that on that pair the EA has not found any suitable positions to open orders?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Looks amusing, dude...certainly better than the alternative...

But I wouldn't be wasting a whole bunch of time or any resources with this demo account.

No real data can be gained from it.

Even after just watching the MASSIVE spikes on all 7 pairs I'm trading, with all accounts...not one of them has rapid fire traded like your IC...

But hey...if ya got nothing else to play with...what the fuck, right?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hope you survived on all pairs here, dude.

Send in some screen shots of the EC!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I'm checking it...please hold.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Found it...

USDJPY is currently in OVERSOLD territory (daily Chart Filtering) and still moving down.

It may have had some positive moments, but the M1 Triggering wouldn't have been engaged in the whipsaw.

At current...USDJPY is in a hold pattern waiting for a little positive loving - it will not be playing shorts at this time.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Ok great thanks for clearing that up. I think this EA will work wonders if we can figure out and establish which pairs its better suited to.

I think finding the right correlating pairs, and adding them together as a collective could work very well.

The journey is finding those pairs and giving them a run an test.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
THIS!!

Couldn't agree more...especially for the current version.

On the first run of Revolution, it's a lot more particular in the pairs it trades in that I have not only set in the Daily Overbought and Oversold Filtering but have also used a Directional Daily Filter.

Meaning...

It should keep all pairs a lot safer in that it won't trade against the general trend...AND...won't look to continue buying overbought or selling into oversold.

As expected, this has limited the trades and profitability...but has also reduced the risk.

Up to current...and only been trading this week...it's seen a Max DD of just over $100...only traded a few pairs for the week...but ya know.

Why not pick the BEST Possible Chances for Success?

Although it has gotten caught in the GBPAUD head-fake...look at the equity curve on this motherfucker:

Will be interesting to see if my Daily Directional Filter carries...

Comparatively Speaking...

Seems that M1 is trading a little better than the Renko...but overall...Not too fucking bad.

Only real difference...seems Renko is holding the shit trades - M1 trader is all closed.

Does that match up to what you have?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Indeed.

Up until now, the Renko fared better, now it's the opposite.

While the account might survive, it also means that, again, a single move might kill a too small account.

I'm glad I used the regular lot size

I'm sure that with enough balance, the account will survive.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thanks god i managed to close all trades before the US news  with profit

i was risking to much 0.25 with 17 pairs loool need to calm down a bit in matter of MM

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Wow!!  Yup.....  in proportion to Magixs starting capital for 7 pairs at .01 lots, the amount of pairs your running and the lots your trading would require about 120k.....lol

--- 帖子 #184 ---
loooool   will mine was around 20k wont do it again for sure

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Thank you magix for your work.

If I love one thing about you, it would be that you're always yourself and real. Well, as much as that possible on a forum. So your posts always look more interesting, than someone without personality.

I am testing this EA on a demo account of mine aswell, btw.

Keep up the great work.

Welcome to my little corner of lunacy!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
loool   But even though , the max DD for the 20k was around 3k only  and yet the balance was growing slowly while the equity follows it from time to time  but due to the USD News i closed all other wise i will keep it running

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Default at all other settings?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Reason I ask, was thinking of a version for larger Timeframs, more suited to larger lot sizes...

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes default settings except the lot =0.25

Kinda like it on 1M man dont change it

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I do kind of like this idea here...some thread I seen a couple days ago...with modified values.

Greater range...looks interesting...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
It look cool with greater targets

But i know myself dude. Am going to close the ea way before that range is over

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Should be time scaleable...

Shorter range, but still directionally based.

Coded to the trend of the day and keeping BB proximity to Trend Bands shouldn't be a lot different than the current version...only difference is that it'd be easier for user to define profit ranges...

Meh...will keep this bitch on the back burner until I have some resources to run other accounts.

Maybe just drop it into a personal trader and see how she flys...

--- 帖子 #195 ---
tma + cg mladen is the indicator in the folder you downloaded.

This needs to be placed in the indicator folder of your MT4 Terminal.  If not there, the EA cannot call on the values and no trades will be taken.

LSE - Experts Folder.

tma+cg - Indicators folder.

Restart terminal - Set autotrading.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hay Magix,

I'm canning the machine gun account and will set up a longer time frame account to test - will provide a TE.  So do I need to change any parameters - like minimum profit close.... or is that pips I guess?  Going to trade .1 lots

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Minimum Profit Close is $ value - ie. Default=$1

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Ah, ok so I should change it to 10 if I use .1 lots.....

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I'd say so...but you also said longer time frame...are you looking at a different TF, or just the length of time that it will be trading?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Was going to try M15....  or if you have something that interests you more, just say and I'll set it up?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
All good with me at M15...I'd set profit to 20-25...should get at least double that of an M1 chart while still being conservative.

See how that goes and we can re-assess...

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Ok, off and running - Minimal Profit Close set to 20

Here is my link Telac

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Awesome!!

Added...

Will be working over the weekend to see if I can throw together the Bollinger band idea posted HERE.

I can kill off a couple of testers to make some room for another idea or 2.

Will also be looking for a Longer TF and larger range...will keep ya posted.

Maybe over the next couple weeks, we can mill the ideas and see where we grow...

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Awesome!  Let me know if you want any other test on TE, think I've got room for 1 more.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Might take you up on that.

Want to do 1 - More Renko Specific for Reamasesa and the BB one...but may need a couple variations to get things rolling.

I've never had much luck with writing in the BB into a successful EA...not even sure why I'm giving it another whirl...

Darkforce preferred the M15, if memory serves...so...I've come a long way from where we started, who knows where we can go.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hey Magix,

yeaaahhh. This Looks great. But like always, there is a big "BUT"

My VPS is really hard fighting with your EA and yesterday it broke down for about three hours because of the Server load.

I have three other MT4-terminals running on that Server, that was too much.

In this time the big News on the $ happened. So the EA closed a lot of orders when I restarted it.

I plan to setup another one only with one MT4 and your EA. Hope I can manage it on the Weekend and start with your brandnew Version next week :-)

For the Moment you can delete my actual TE, I WILL BE BACK, with another one.

Cheers and Keep up the good work! Thank you!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Well, my account just got blown by the news yesterday, I'm planning to re-fund it and start with 5M and 5 Pips Renko. Need to seriously lower the triggering for such small accounts like my demo.

Magix, I saw some buys as well as sells, is that correct?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Well shit, hey?

Corrupted data is of no value...I've had some restart issues myself...running this EA on a single terminal can be a bit of a Pig, but when you are running it on several, shit gets deep, FAST!

Thanks for the honesty though.

Let me know when you get restarted and I will add the new account to Post 1.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #212 ---
$150...was a skinny start and especially for 2 traders on the same pair, but ya never know until you try it right?

The New Filter I am running with Revolution is currently holding an account $140 underwater - EURUSD pairs alone causing the DD, but with Margin, even it would have issues with a small account.

Have another idea on this that I will be writing in and restarting this weekend...

Yup, the EA will trade bi-directionally. If the direction changes, it will both trade the new direction as well as cost average during times of market weakness.

All versions that I play with do...given the logic set to continue trading in market weakness, working both directions can bank a couple of bucks while we are waiting for the fat to be trimmed.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
This is modern life. You have to say thank you for being honest .... :-)

To be serious. You share, we try. All together could be helpful for all of us...

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Using your PC Resources most effectively...

As somebody who doesn't actually do many of the things I am telling you about, these are things that can allow your testing on multiple accounts to not cause as many issues with your current resources...

I mean...ultimately...most here are in search of the holy grail more than are looking for actual trade logic that may assist them...right?

Looking at the template posted...is my vision of market...the logic of the EA...but in the end, the only thing that really makes any difference is the equity curve. If this fucker was tanking or blew up an account, why bother trying to figure out how it did that...there's already hundreds of threads where grids and martingales already do this exact thing...that nobody gives a shit about...

I look at the logic as much as I like to see the test accounts that others use. Reason being...I fully understand what the logic is and says, so if shit starts to go sideways, I can look for ideas to implement to maybe build that better mousetrap...

[/End Digression]

So...here's what you can do...

1. Open the trade pairs you want to have this run on (FRESH CLEAN CHARTS) and then, close down ALL other pairs that you aren't watching in the MarketWatch...

Top Left-hand corner of your terminal, under the word "Insert", is a double arrow icon...click it. This shows all of the pairs that data is being processed on, chewing up resources for no reason. Right-click and "Hide All". This will eliminate all of the pairs that you aren't currently trading.

2. Select the timeframe, add the EA and close down EVERY OTHER CHART! This should be used as a testing account and if you are working with the specific premise to TEST a selected EA, there's no need to have additional charts, timeframes, indicators or anything else open.

3. Depending on how long you've had this account, you may have a lot of historical data. Open Data Folder - History - [BrokerName - Server], CTRL+a and delete. There is a VERY good likelihood that unless this terminal has run 24/7 since you've installed, the data here is corrupted by huge gaps anyways, along with historical data on every other chart and timeframe you've ever opened. GET RID OF IT!!

4.  Restart terminal.

You are now ready to have things run as smooth as possible...

Unless...you are testing on multiple terminals...go through all of these and repeat as necessary.

Problem is, if there wasn't a massive drop and close of trades, sooner (Renko) or later (Regular) would have blown the account even if they were traded separately, trend was too strong, I guess.

That's how it looks zoomed out

Loaded the EA onto my VPS, and added some more pairs today, bringing the total to 6.

This first week has been pretty good and I'm impressed. DD has been relatively low considering the amount of pairs and running trades.

which pairs are you running this EA on?

Thanks

All testing members are encouraged to share their findings by loading a FF Trade Explorer or loading their accounts onto myfxbook.com and sharing a link.

When they do this...

1. All links are posted on the first thread post.

2. Click onto the name of the account - Thread related is attached.

3. Click on the Trade Report.

4. All tested pairs and other relevant statistics can be found here.

The value of what I create can only be reliably verified by those testing defaults and examined by others testing different pairs, timeframes and ranges.

The more we work together, the happier we'll be...

Week 1 over for Revolution and overall, I'm good with the results.

Given the USD Headfakes this week, 3 pairs could have been very heavily impacted like were on Evolution.

GBPUSD, EURUSD, AUDUSD...which seemed to even have an impact on GBPAUD and EURAUD.

In spite of this...greatest draw, I seen on Revolution was around the $200 mark - Leveraged 500:1 - Margin at less than $100.

Gains on the week - $115, currently holding $88 in DD - we're GREEN!

With a goal of reducing the required size of the primary account to run this to the area of $1000, I'd say that we're definitely getting closer.

There is a little logic that I think could be cleaned/tightened up, but the overall CORE trading Logic - Closely mimicking Evolution - Seems pretty solid.

Can't really count on a single week and with a couple more tweaks...will carry on for the next while before I look for a public release.

Happy Weekend All!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Shit a brick!!!!!

.......well, the EA kicks some serious butt.

I haven't been running it properly as I have changed settings, time frames and not running it 24/7 throughout testing.

I will let it run on a VPS next week.

I have no idea how this EA works, so the changes that I have made to the EA are purely guess work......me at my finest!

Anyway, to the more important issue here....... Magix, you made a post some days ago about a performing enhancing product for men. My question is........will it work for the wife??

I like what you are doing here, many thanks.

Welp...Tore this motherfucker apart and went through the line by line...Revolution!

Been playing with a couple more ideas and have finally got them inked into the Revolution Version...

Worked to make a more selective and consistent profit directional Trigger on Grid EA and I think this will be it.

Due to the Daily Directional - I think it may require several pairs to see some growth and action, but should be suitable for the 17 pairs on the Revolution Tester - So, I've swapped it out!

Will most likely take some time to start churning some serious value - but Consistency and Safety is the Name of this Game!

Locked n Loaded!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Why trigger on grid?

What does this actually mean??

Very good questions!

if you fairly new to Grid Style Trading or new to any of my logic, this may not make a lot of sense...

When you build a Grid - from primary to subsequent trades, there is a Standard distance between each trade...thus the term GRID..

That's easy.

What this basically is, is a minimum distance between trades.  Coding this in, comes out to be fairly accurate as price execution on Forex is pretty fast, so pretty simple idea.

But the problems come in under a term that a lot of Grid Traders are familiar with, called "The Death Candle".

What's a death candle?

It's when price, in a certain defined timeframe or idea, moves grossly against your current trade and under a Standard Grid Trader, enters in multiple trades which are now against the trend and counting down to if not the absolute DEATH of your equity.

It's like this...and we don't see it often, but often enough...you are in a series of Shit Trades - ie - trades against the trend.  The market continues to move against you and you keep cost averaging in...

You are now in a "Oh Fuck" situation in that between your margin and current DD, you can no longer sustain all trades.

Add in a Large Leverage and your money starts to disappear FAST!

Massive closing of trades because you don't have the capital requirements to keep everything open or with leverage, and speed of direction, everything comes to a CRASHING FUCKING ACCOUNT!

When I first began trading, there was an estimated 2000 new traders PER DAY!

I speculated that, given the ideas and information available, there was probably an equal amount of accounts blown per day.

Don't believe me?

Go through FF or any Forex trade forum and you can see all of the Egomaniacs and Newbies with massive posts, simply fall off of the pages.

Why?

Well...they work similar to Grid Style Trading without acceptable margin to cover the accounts.

I've been there...

Fuck...I've been there more times automated than I'd care to talk about.

Nobody wants to take a loss...but when your margin is called, you are fucked!

You cannot unring these bells.

SO...rather than cost averaging based on a BLIND GRID, I've worked on logic that will be a lot more patient.

Doesn't always work out...but does save a lot of accounts from the "Death Spike".

What it does, is wait patiently for price to SLOW DOWN and market to show some weakness when price is moving against the current or any/all existing trades.

This is a precarious balance, but in the end, has shown enough market restraint to keep a steady flow of funds and reduce market risk.  Well...Mostly...there's always risk, but more general than specific to Black Swan events.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Martingale Trading...

The actual idea vs what others do, this is quite often 2 very different ideas.

Martingale trading, simply put and as applied to basic gambling:

You are playing blackjack...

You play your first hand with a willingness to lose $1 on your first deal.

You lose...

DOUBLE DOWN...

Now you are prepared to gamble $2 on your next bet.

You lose...

DOUBLE DOWN...

Now you are prepared to lose $4.

Then $8, $16, $32, $64...

Martingale, as applied to a Grid Trader, means that you are consistently adding, but the Draw on your account increases with every position that is cost averaged.

Meaning...you start off with $.10...your grid is 10 pips..by then you are $1 in the shitter.

Anybody can take a loss at this...

But then!!

You add in a doubled position $.20 and price Moves Against you still...

By the time a 3rd level is hit...you are 20 pips in the shit with your first trade ($2) and another $2 in this shit on your subsequent trade, waiting for a Retrace for profit and close...but since the next 10 pip grid is hit...you are now holding .1 (first trade), .2 (second trade), .4 (third trade) and when we are in trend and market continues to move against you...this can litterally happen in a matter of Seconds if not minutes!

When market is in trend...this is an issue...

But what happens if you are in trend and the News is against you?

Check out this post HERE.

Can you imagine if there was:

1.  A standard grid in place.

2.  A martingale factor applied as per standard martingale grid logic?

Yup...

You'd be fucked!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Ya don't have to believe what I'm saying...

Check out the size of accounts that are required to test most of the grid trade EAs that are currently "Hot Topics".

Watch how fast these guys have to fire up an additional account.

And then look at how many threads around FF are like this:
Lost $4.2k in 1 week
Suicide and forex

Or just general posters that are deep in the shit and have No Idea what they can do...maybe it's already you...

Succeeding in market, isn't about market perfection, it is about Living to Fight another Day!

So...why not just have a Stop Loss?

Another Great Question...

Once you have a trade idea...you start to work with it.

Somedays it works...other days...not so well...

But...you are still ahead of the game and inside of your head, you continue to think, I need to make more profit and lose less trades...

So...

You reduce your Stop Loss and keep your profit the same...and then...you are now losing more trades than winning.

FUCK!

So, to help make the difference, you increase the size of your profit idea and keep the same stop loss...

An now, you are winning a lot less trades, but making being stopped out a lot more...

Your account is still shrinking...

FUCK!

So, you decide that if you cost average on your great idea you can now be more profitable by losing less trades...

Nope...

FUCK FUCK FUCK!!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Trading around the clock...with the trend...perfecting your logic may work for a certain percentage of time...

Why?

If you follow the trend and the market goes sideways...you're fucked!

If you play chop and the market goes into trend...you're fucked!

But the overall will look like the following.

Reason being...even when you follow the rules, it doesn't always guarantee success!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Now...

I know what you are thinking...

What am I selling?

Answer...nothing.

Well...encouraging safety, but this comes at a price of FREE.

There are 2 EAs on the first post.  One that was created under a standard grid concept - that failed...the other, Trigger on Grid, playing market direction.

I encourage you to not only play with what I've edited and posted, but to also run the original to see how fast the proverbial shit can hit the fan.

After that...

Because you have the source code and an idea of what and how to code from earlier posts...give this shit a try!

No...it's not easy.

But neither is consistent profitability in market!

Take the time to know your craft and once you've taken the time to automate your ideas, it will lend itself GRANDLY to any idea that you decide to trade manually or automated.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Have you blown an account or lost considerable equity, playing the trend?

Believe me when I say this...you are not alone!

Have you played trend until you've hit your loss threshold and then, started playing the inverse to only lose again?

Believe me when I say this...you are not alone!

Brokers don't make money when you win...

Check out the number of these motherfuckers on FF alone!

If brokers made money when you did...they'd consist of one guy, at his computer, with select software, taking and make the shekels when you did.

There'd be no Leverage...

There'd be no support...

Just one guy/broker getting fat, counting the money he is making with your trades!

Banks would collapse...

Economies would change...

and then!

The eventual Standstill!

If stocks, bonds, currencies were valued at their actual value and everybody had the same idea of when to buy and sell...

The markets would cease to exist!

You have a name...

You've created a profile under another for your email...

Still not good enough though...is it?

Everybody has a bias.

This bias is based on our own experience and it is what keeps us unique...good or bad.

You work hard to separate your self from your given names...and your broker will always keep your nick as one thing.

You are "Liquidity"!

You can win the day...week...month...

That's temporary, because as you win, your other namesake brothers and sisters, commonly named "Liquidity" are losing their collective asses!

Hey...

You!!!

When's the last time you looked at yourself in the mirror?

Have you just packed that shit in, and just go with...whatever?

There's no big secret to both being and feeling more handsome...best part about it...it's free!

I've spent some time googling and working on what others have to sell...being all short fat n bald, why wouldn't I?

Who really doesn't want to see a better version of themselves in the mirror?

Well...let me tell ya...

That feeling and being doesn't come from a pill bottle, book, or website subscription.

Sure...they can help, but seriously save your CASH!

Yup...I do take supplements, but they aren't "The Answer", but they do help.

So...how?

Well...I have some history here...suffered from a lot of things, but most of that, overconsumption.

I tell ya...my biggest issues is that I have close to ZERO self-restraint!

Imagine yourself...or if you are already here...feeling like every meal is Thanksgiving or Christmas!

You eat to your absolute MAX and feel like a bag of shit after...and then...you still feel hungry!

What the Absolute Fuck is up with that?

Never happened as a kid...was always fairly wellbeing prior...why now?

Is it because I got older?

Kinda...

There is a lot of things that happen to your body as you age, and in fact, just aging is considered a disease, by some!

As in...aging should be able to be cured...

Now...this isn't exactly true, but as you move on with life, you don't have to feel progressively worse.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
You see...

As you age, certain metabolic changes happen, and that is inevitable...

Like growth...

You live a ripe life to 90 years old, do you really want to be growing taller, that entire time?

I mean seriously, clothes - that keep you looking good - aren't cheap...could you imagine how many sets you'd have to buy if you continued to grow after 18?
(and not in the waistline)

We have a body that has developed over thousands of years to be a VERY smart entity.

While your brain may not feel that way, your body has an autopilot that has progressed throughout evolution.  Meaning...it's a lot smarter than you are by being exposed to a lot less information.

The information that it works with is - a feeling for well being and survival.

If you feel hungry, your body tells you this and you feel the need to eat, and do so.

If you are FAT and hungry, your body still equates being hungry as part of survival, and tells you that you need to eat...

Well, fuck!

How's a fella drop a few pounds?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Simple, right?

Eat less, move more!

Huh?

Yeah, drop your calorie intake and get more exercise!

But...if that's all there was to it, why are so many people FAT and out of shape?

Simply speaking...eat less and move more...is an absolute failure!

Why?

Again...your body has a mind of its own and thinks a different way based on the information that it's getting...it likes to think that it is smarter than you are!

Ya ever watch that show, "Biggest Loser"?

An entire show on how fat people work together as a group to lose weight...great premise, and people do the - eat less and move more - and lose incredible amounts of weight...so it obviously works...right?

WRONG!

That show has been on the air for several years and has never done a "Reunion" episode...ya know...to show how fat people became skinny and then moved onto their ideal weight and live happily ever after...

Wonder why?

Simple...

They all got fat again!

WHAT??

True story...

They all sign NDAs to be on the show, and when they get fat again, their non-disclosure agreement prohibits them from talking about it...and so...they CAN'T!

But...some have...

And guess what?

They've confirmed they're fat!  Some, fatter than were before!!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Yeah...I know what your saying...once a pig, always a pig...

Or, they fell off the program...

Or, they got Lazy...

And some of this, isn't entirely false!

BUT!

There is solid reason around it and solid reason around the fact that those that got fat again, never fell off of the program...

What?

Yeah...that's how this shit works...remember...your body has a mind of its own and is actually working against you when you move to drop a few pounds...

What, why and how?

Ya see, it's like this...

You have something called a body set weight. Your body has an idea of what's going on and continues to thrive under the circumstances it is accustomed...like your mind would in any circumstance...but your body understands this partially by mass - ie. what you weigh...

So...you drop a few pounds on a diet...you fit into smaller pants...you feel great...life is good...AND THEN!

You gain back the weight...and add more pounds...nothing fits...you feel like shit!

What the fuck happened?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Well...it's like this...

Along with your Body Set Weight (that your body is accustomed to being), it also maintains an idea of what it takes to maintain this, by body metabolic rate - BMR.

Meaning what??

Meaning...

It's like this...every product you look at, has a Nutritional Value and a lot of that is measured on a basic diet of 2000 Calories per day...

So?

What the fuck is this anyway???

Well...it's like this...

If you were completely immobile, in a coma or simply inactive, your body still requires energy - by way of calories - to function.  Your brain, lungs, heart...need energy!

If you are moving...they require a lot more!

But...for the average Schelb, you need 2000 calories just to function.

Okay...good...easy to understand, right?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
So...products put their value on there, to try and sell you into their value.

And...it totally makes sense...if you are wanting to consume 2000 calories per day, you can easily spreadsheet your way into maintaining your weight.

BUT

What happens when you want to lose weight?

Simple!!

Eat Less and Move More!

Right?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
WRONG!

Hey Magix. I have made a new demo account I can run 24/7, would love to test out Lost Sock Revolution for you! See here https://www.forexfactory.com/1qaz2wsx33#acct.85

--- 帖子 #254 ---
BSW - Body Set Weight

BMR - Basal Metabolic Rate

These 2 things are working against you...why?

Because your body is ALWAYS in a state of preservation.  It equates your weight and number of calories to maintain your weight as it's primal goals...so, will keep you hungry after you've eaten, if it isn't getting what it needs, out of the deal!

What??

Okay...kind of confusing at this point, and thus the reasons for 1000s of diets that you can take part in and zillions of people who have failed to lose weight and maintain this weight loss...where some diets work...

Ya see, the information is bullshit and the only people who are benefitting are the people who sell something for you to NOT LOSE WEIGHT!

Kinda feels like the Forex Market...doesn't it?

There are thousands of threads on FF...on how to WIN THE MARKET...

In the same ways that...

There are thousands of ways to diet...on how to lose weight...

And...

If you've tried them, you are seemingly no closer to success than you were before you started...

Right?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
You see...your account is like your body...

If you feed it more gains than losses, it can get bigger!

But...it's a little different...

Go on...

It's like this...

You drop your calories in, you have some success in losing weight...and then, nothing changes, but you start gaining back weight?

What?

Well...like the Losers after "The Biggest Loser", these people aren't morally corrupt...they've seen progress and want to continue this same progression...

Much the same as a Forex Trader can see some gains, and want to continue on with the same gains...

But then...a quick look back and shit has all changed...

The fat people, now skinnier, continuing on with their diet...started to gain weight again.

What?

Yeah...remember, there is a reason that there is no "Biggest Loser Reunion" show.

They didn't just simply FALL off the diet...in fact, some of these poor motherfuckers tortured themselves into hospital type situations to continue their progress...only to FAIL, gain back the weight and not be ready for a reunion.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
It's like a lost cause...right?

If these motherfuckers can't keep it off...

Much like

If all of these motherfuckers at FF can't make gains...

Why bother?

I hear ya...

But...if you start to understand either your market or you body...you can make gains and actually keep the gains and progress...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Look at the Trade Explorer attached to the thread...

HINT - Top of your current screen...

Gains are growing - in a very distinct pattern...but if you look at the Draw Down...you think...wow, that's a lot!

Understandable!

AND...it can actually equate to the same as being in better shape...

WHAT??

How do fewer gains equal greater equity?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Before we go into this answer...let me tell you about my last couple weeks...

On January 2nd, I went on a 5 day water fast - Lasted 4 days - Not due to hunger, more to circumstance...

In those days, I lost 12 pounds...

1 pound = 3500 calories per day...

Meaning, in 4 days, I theoretically lost 42,000 calories - 10,500 calories per day?

How the fuck is that possible?

If BMR is around 2000 calories per day...4x 2000 equals 8000 calories - equals just over 2 pounds...how can you lose 12 pounds?

Well...your body stores a lot of water weight...so, one of the first things that happens is that you lose this...after that, you can drop mass, but the only TRUE GAINS are on the losses minus the water weight...don't spend a lot of time focusing on this...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Now...

The big question!!

It's Saturday Night...my time...what the fuck are you people still doing hanging out at FF, reading my weight loss bullshit?

lol...

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Shifted Focus...

After my Water Fast ended, I went to an Intermittent Fasting Protocol.

1 meal per day - eat as much as I wanted to.

There really are only issues with this idea, if you want to Gain Weight...problem being, you cannot consume one of your regular or previous days of eating, in a single setting.

Test me?

Fuck yeah!

You wanna see a guy cut through 10 McDoubles inside of 5 minutes...I'm your guy!

You wanna see a dozen hot dogs in buns gone in a single meal...pshhhhhhhhh

You wanna see somebody eat a large pizza to themselves?  EASY!

Swap that shit up too, this is the only meal you get to eat...and all of this becomes a lot harder.

Your stomach shrinks and you can't eat as much...makes sense...but this is really only a small part of the deal...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Throughout February, I have tried to focus on Eating 5000 calories per day!

WHAT?

Why go through a water fast or an entire month of only eating a single meal per day to lose weight...

And Then!!

Eat like a total fucking pig?

Yup...

Did it...still doing...and...still hammering back the beer...

More fucking calories??

This is insane...right?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Kinda...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
So here's the divergence from Trading to Losing Weight...

You can actually consume more Calories and continue on with improving your overall body, whereas you cannot continue to lose money and think that your trading is getting better.

Anabolic vs Catabolic...

When you are Anabolic you cannot be Catabolic - And Vice Versa...

This is a general rule to live by!

There are exceptions, but FUCK...that's like pissing up a rope!

Anabolic - You are building muscle

Catabolic - You are breaking down muscle

Pretty simple...you cannot be building and tearing down at the same time...

When you consume less calories, you are catabolic...when you overconsume...supposedly, you are anabolic...but this actually really only equates to Muscle.

So...if you are eating fucking garbage food...you gain weight...but aren't building muscle.

If consequently, you are eating fucking garbage food, but are in a calorie deficit...your loss is muscle loss...

Your gains can literally be losses as what you consume can be to build muscle - improve your physique, or to lose weight and increase the size of your belly.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
HOLY SHEEPSHIT!!

IF it's this complicated...no wonder why there is a Global Obesity Issue!!
(yeah, I know there are exceptions to this)

Eat more...get fat...

Eat more...get a better physique...

Eat Less...lose weight...

Eat Less...gain more body fat!

How fucking confusing can things get?

Seriously...Forex is a lot easier to understand!!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Okay...

So...when I realized I was fat...seeing sparkles when I tied my shoes...

I was tipping the scales at about 240lbs.

Dear Christ - That's on the verge of morbidly obese!

I drank copious amounts of beer and ate what I wanted to!

Now...

Lowest weight...171.6!

Maintain 175.5...

AND!

I drink copious amounts of beer and eat whatever I want!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I know what you're thinking...

Dude only eats Vegetables!

lol

Pick the combination of vegetables that you'd eat or have to eat to get to 5000 calories per fucking day!

Invite me to one of your meals, I'd love to see anybody even try this!

IM  Fucking POSSIBLE!

Or...really, improbable...I've been shocked before...

Yeah...I don't try to consume 5000 calories per day on vegetables and in fact, I don't even try to count my vegetable calories in my daily consumption...

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Oh...

Shift your thoughts to Atkins or Ketogenic!

Well...

Kinda!

But...I'm not gulping down gallons of butter and coconut oil...not eating Bacon every meal...

I am very conscious of what I am eating and do try to consume, what my body needs...

In this...there is another balance...

Nope...not with breads, fruits and sugars...simply being, I don't eat any of that shit!

Oh...I know...there are purists amongst us and refuse to believe that these are the enemies...and to some of you, I agree - 100%!

You see...I do believe the same things can be accomplished under a Vegan or Vegetarian diet - This, just isn't the diet for me!

And - Yes - I have tried!

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Once I eliminated my primary gastrinal issues, I watched a documentary called "Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead".

Joe suffered from a lot of issues and managed to cure this and an obesity issue by drinking Juiced fruits and Vegetables.

After watching this...next day, I went out and bought the SAME juicer and a couple hunny worth of veg n fruit!

Tried this idea...even managed 10 days of a juice diet and I tell ya what...

You will NEVER be as Afraid to Fart for any length of time, like you will on a Juice Fast!

Dear Fucking Christ!!

IF you want to torture yourself, I highly recommend this, even above Niacin...

But...you'd best be getting used to wearing saran wrapped shorts or carrying multiple pairs to get through this!

AND...

In the end...it totally fucks you!

Your body drops its BMR, so when you go back to a regular diet...you gain all the weight back...

Even worse...if you go through a 30 day fast like Joe...just try eating solid food again!

Fuck THAT!!

BUT...

My takeaway from it...My body can live off of fluids for a set length of time...which eventually lead me to a Water Fast and all of it's benefits!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Goes like this...

I drank the worst tasting shit on the planet in self-juiced vegetables for 10 days!

Felt like SHIT throughout the whole thing, to the point I would have eaten a gun as fast as I would have eaten a cheeseburger, and I fucking LOVE cheeseburgers!

I had my first meal - After the 10 day fast - and felt like I was donkey kicked in the stomach, was laid out for 2 days after!

Okay...so then what?

So...I'm a pattern guy...I study markets...I write EAs...the body is nothing more than a pattern, right?

KINDA!!!

Anyways...along the Atkins/Keto idea...I decided to do the same thing, but using protein!

Welp...Decided to give this a whirl and through a regular working schedule, only consuming protein shakes managed to make it 4 full days.

Given the induction back into whole foods and some family issues (dying parent), didn't want to push the envelope!

So...after 4 days...back to whole foods...Fuck...was this easy!

Figured I would give this a try and then, leap fully into Keto/Velocity/Low Calorie - and see how it went!

5 days down - Consuming ONLY my maintenance calories on protein - 600 calories per day - lept into a single meal per day, subsidized by protein shakes and went on for 2 months!

Welp...it's like this...

Protein shakes suck Donkey Dick!

If you can handle them for a day...you are a king!

If they are your only meal per day, and you last a few days...you are a GOD!

Using them to try and keep maintenance protein per day and trying to keep calories to 600/day, for a couple months...GOD HELP YOU!

But...I did it!

And...lost 50 pounds...

With this time in...lost the craving for sweets, carbohydrates and shit food in general.

Enjoyed every morsel of food I consumed and managed well into Beer Drinking Season!

--- 帖子 #273 ---

Being in better shape and the number on your home scale, are 2 very different things!

Building your ideal body based on a number is BULLSHIT!

Building your ideal body based on ANYBODY BUT YOU - IS TOTAL BULLSHIT!

Give some respect to people that do this shit for a living, in the same way, you SHOULD to a successful trader who trades for a living.

DON'T GAUGE YOUR SUCCESS BY SOMEBODY ELSE'S STANDARDS!

You Fat...out of shape...wanna lose a few pounds and feel better?

Focus on that!

Not what anybody else says...

THROW AWAY YOUR SCALE and let your pant size be your guide!!

--- 帖子 #275 ---

It means...you are FREE to be a better version of YOU!

Scales are BULLSHIT!

IF/When you can look in the mirror and think that you look better, you've succeeded!

No...it's not easy, but a few guidelines and I bet money, marbles or chalk, it's a fuck pile easier than you thought!

How you going to start?

Pshhhhhhhhh...

The same reco I made for your Valentine's night (read back in this thread) will be your beginning!

No...not just based on better sex, that's actually and only a by-product...

Wait, whut?

Start with better sex and move into a better body?

Killing off TMA - After half a year.

It did well - until the New Year Trend...still closing down with almost 50% on gains with the current DD.

The New Triggering logic from Revolution may work well with this Core, but will see how the Revolution works with current.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Added your Revolution trader to the thread...for whatever reason, I cannot select 2 of my own accounts...

Thanks for the post, dude!

\m/

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Okay...

So, why $200 per pair, you may be asking??

Why not just $200 and run one pair??

It's like this...working with Evolution, I've seen a DD of around $1100, running on 7 pairs - Giving a Max Requirement of $150 ish - so far!!

Because Revolution shows a little more restraint in logic, $200 should more than keep the accounts afloat in almost any market condition...Almost!

But...with showing more restraint, there may be a lot larger gaps between trades that need to be cost averaged out...meaning...though we shouldn't wake up to an account run overnight and a market trend change, there could still be a lot of trades in play due to being a little less aggressive.

Triggering seems to be correct in the Strat Tester, but shit can change FAST when comes time to live trading.

Now...part of the success in Evolution is because it can be a little more aggressive in cost averaging, meaning that it will increase the profitability...but in this, it also increases the risk.

I know...simple, right...

Add more money to your live account and just bank the gains...

And...yeah, this can definitely be done...can already be done with Evolution, but the idea is to possibly have a larger lot size in trade on smaller accounts...

Again...looking at what is available for up and running grid traders, some of them will be profitable with $5k in...but having worked with Martingale or increased lot Cost Averaging, I can tell you that a single day can turn your account into Dust...and your broker won't even send you a Thank You Email.

Safety First!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Aggressive Cost Averaging!

For those that were around the Falling Knives thread, you know that I had at one point, added in a Hyper Aggressive Triggering logic that would work to cost average out - directionally.

Well...this worked sometimes, but over the long run...ended up with accounts in ashes and a lot too easy to overload single pairs in trade locking the account at typically 200 trades, that are now running FAST against you, with no ability to be in on a hedge...

With previous logic, the Sum of All trades needed to be above a minimum profit point to close out...this was part of the issue...

What if we have a separate - Make or Break Bot - that can stand in place to hammer fucking trades on a per pair basis to help get shit cleaned up??

Given that the Current Core will require sums of trades above a minimum balance to close out the worst positions, getting aggressive with this, might actually make a lot more sense...

Going to fuck around with this idea over the next short period of time and if I can get triggering set properly and develop an idea that works...may look to add this to the thread tools.

Really...as long as the Magic Number from the hyper-close EA is the same as current and active trades...logic should continue to rapid fire to save any grid or single trade EA.

Risk?

FUCK YEAH!

But...effectively calculated, may be the difference between having an account or slowly watching it die a horrible death.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Ya see...it could be as EASY as just using position and directionally triggering to hyper flood until trades get closed...and then, it stops working!

Check it...

2 Areas where we have potential to cost average out...and you can see where some of the higher positions have closed out the trades...but there's still a fist full of these motherfuckers open...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
So...

Earlier on in the thread, we looked at coding and one particular case...applied directionally.

Inserted Code if((b==0
if((s==0

These are the primary triggers...

By eliminating these, we could just work with the...

Inserted Code if(b>0
if (s>0

Meaning, that there must be open trades in order to engage the hyper triggering...if all of these motherfuckers are closed...the logic will not know to take a primary trigger and you may be able to just sit back...wipe the sweat off your brow and you not only live to fight another day...but have a couple of extra shekels in the account...

It's a neat idea...to be sure, but will have to have criteria set and with enough grid space to not continuously trigger more waves of trades...by leaving rogue positions behind!

That could be dangerous!

Will definitely need some ponder time on this idea and will see what can be done...but I think this idea has potential and well...why not giver a whirl, right?

Changed shit up a bit...

Since energetic has been running Evolution since a public release and running it on the same pairs...it shows a good confirmation of trading.

Because my Revolution trader has a lot more pair data, might be more prudent to have this as a showcase.

Win...lose...or draw...

Important for all to understand risk:reward.

The only custom indicator needed for this EA is TMA+CG and it only has to be in the indicators folder for this to work.

The EA is written to try and avoid chop and watch for trades in trend, so it can take a while before it all starts getting going and the amount of activity will be based on the number of pairs in trade.

Let me know if you don't get any over the next dayish or so and we can see if you are having any other issues.

Well...

Looks like the Revolution has had a decent maiden voyage...

Very Kewl...19 pairs in trade...gridded with a Minimum 2 pip Grid Size and only $23 in the shit while closing off over 100 trades overnight!

LOVE IT!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks to Magix for choosing me as tester. I am your fans since 2013 when I start to use your "Christmas Bot"

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Welcome all....

I started this morning on the VPS and my actual result can be seen here.

BTW; I installed the default settings on 14 pairs.

Thank you for giving me the chance to be part of it.

And here is my TE

Cheers

While reviewing this LINK, it's almost 4 years ago. I appreciate the idea of donation you used to give out the license for live trading.

Both of you Revolution Testers looking good, as well!!

Very Nice!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
We definitely pulled together as a group to help pass the Christmas Spirit!

Made a little money and had some fun too...but this was seemingly just the bi-product of the thread.

Good Times!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I believe the donation spirit spreading out is the most significant regardless how much donations we will have.

Hey Akkus,

Welcome to the group.

Trying to understand the Dip in your Testing...

What happened there?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Oh Magic , one moment, I will explain shortly.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Welp...

Bit of a Lackluster NY session...most probably due to the bank Holiday.

Happy Presidents Day to my American Friends and Happy Family Day to my fellow Canucks!

Ok Magic, you can see on attached picture , I was start EA on SGD but after 2 days , I decided it is not good choice run EA on SGD crosses and I closed all orders of SGD manually. Regards.

Added your link to the first post.  All being said, looks like it's making some gains back...

Good stuff, dude and thanks for the explanation!

Hey Admir,

The Evolution accounts that are testing (listed on the first post) - including my original - HERE - are being tested on Default Settings and on M1 charts.

Revolution hasn't been released publicly yet...we've only just begun testing on it, and it was only offered to control group for trial. Should have a public release/barring any required changes, over the next couple weeks.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
All seriousness...

We had a day of chop and just over 1 day of full-on trading...

My test account...has seen DD of around $50 throughout today...given it's trading on 19 pairs, on an M1 chart, with a Minimum 2 pip grid...It could have looked a lot worse...200 trades Closed...w0w!

On that...I believe it will not be able to maintain the low DD across the board, but thus the reason for the account requirements of Minimum $200 per pair.  The likelihood if it going to shit on all pairs at the same time...Not that high, but could happen...

Even this account, I've never tested my brokers threshold for Max Trades and if it is 200...this will start to get REALLY UGLY, REALLY FAST!

But that's why we test em out first...need to get a full understanding of the risks and rewards...

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Top Revolution Trade Pair - and on a Very Weak USD day - GBPUSD.

7 Series of trades closed - Sitting about $10 ahead on this one.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Lowest Performer - Revolution - Very Choppy Market Day for EJ...Toggling between a Long and Short Chart (according to trade logic), only found one opportunity for profit.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
The Thread Release - Evolution - At Default 7 pairs for 5 full weeks.

Sitting clear about $1000 and running at close to double the speed of it's predecessor.

Still Packing in wins at 83.2% currently in a $500 Draw Down Situation - but only losing 472 trades out of 2,871 that have been closed.

Pretty fucking stellar!

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Heh...

--- 帖子 #336 ---
REVOLUTION i like it , amazing man

running 16 pairs with 0.25 per pair loool (( demo ))

hope it will show its great way when market start to go crazy

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I got my demo account up for all to see

Just got it started with the Rev version

running one pair EU

Thanks Magix

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Slow and steady it goes - probably could add more pairs to it with the capital there.  Revolution also running like a Swiss watch so far - kinda nice to be able to speak of trading and relaxation simultaneously

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Ditto that, my brother!

Ditto that.

But...if all hell does break loose and at some point, it's kind of an expectation - especially on anything over 10 pairs per account...I still have the Daily Filtered version for comparison...

Post HERE - first week of the Daily Filtered Version of Revolution, was sitting at almost $90 in the shit...got that down some, with adding in additional pairs and are now looking at a little better picture.

The version HERE, should prove to be the safest trader...but hey...for some quick turns, who knows what this will do.

There is one more filter that I am pondering to help save on overtrading long ranges...but will keep that in backs for right now...still have a lot to watch and learn from before I need this...

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Added to the first post!

Thanks, dude!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
It's still early on...but I am in absolute shock and awe of this motherfucker already...

Just floored that it's spent so much time churning while maintaining such a low DD.

About an hour ago...DD was like $2 until some trades closed...

[blink, blink]

Very Nice!

The side-by-side comparison on AUDUSD...(Hope the picture works out)

Evolution is bagging some longs from before Revolution was launched.

When the shot was taken, Evolution (left) had 5 trades in...Revolution only 3.

Small differences...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
On the other side of the Aussie Move...

EURAUD.

Evolution Left - Took 4 trades - Revolution 1.

On just these 2 pairs, there is a difference in trades of 5.

Revolution has 5 less trades adding to the DD...may not seem like a lot now...but that's a fuck pile when comes time to making up this range.

Live to fight another day!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Good morning - or which daytime ever you have :-)

The Project starts really promising. Great !

After viewing the X-Mas - thread I would like to say that the idea to donate parts of possible winnings sounds great.

Maybe we should think about it when making this public. I am sure there are enough Projects in the world which are

worth to give more attention and, more than that, some money.

Revolution is running with 13 pairs in my demo account for around 24 hours now. Please see the first Milestone after

that short period of time.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Part of the result is a gain of around 56€, but the biggest DD I had in this period was only 37€. Impressive.

Let´s see what will happen in more volatile situations.

Cheers and thanks for all the work People are doing here.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
It's a grid trader. I think it can work in the long term if you withdraw profits regularly and babysitt the EA by closing draw-down positions manually.

Apart from that I am interested in trying the "Revolution" version because I saw it just openend 1 buy order on the clearly short-term bearish EURAUD instead of 5 buys like the version I have did.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
This was the last 12 hours (Floatin P/L is -30$ so actual profit is 17$). Regarding EURAUD: closed it manually because I anticipated the DD becomes too big.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Can we please have the "Revolution" version... seems safer

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Had a bit of a hick up with my Revolution test. My VPS couldn't handle the load of running 20 charts with the EA and it kept closing, so I had to close and restart on my laptop.

It's all up and going now, hopefully not too much of an interference.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Added your tester to the first post!

Thanks!

\m/

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Happens to me every once in a while as well...

For the most part, given the logic and market tendency - unless you are down for entire days, trends don't shift that much over the course of a day, so...you're probably fine!

Just treat any closes like weekend Gaps...

--- 帖子 #353 ---
It's people like you that really suck the life out of me!

And...not even in the fact that you find "donating" for a grid trader to be embarrassing.

More to the point that you have been here for like 10 fucking seconds, don't bother to contribute in any meaningful way, and with ZERO history in working with a group that has come together for a general likeness and want of profitability, are carrying a sense of entitlement that completely pisses me off.

What the fuck do I owe you?

Are we old pals or something?

I mean, seriously, where the fuck do you get off with this shit anyways??

Nobody held a gun to your head and told you to run this EA...and if you think you have better ideas - source code is on the first post.  Go to Town!

As I don't believe you will show any value to the folk here and me having no real patience for this kind of shit...will just keep you from taking away from the general spirit of this thread.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Looking good, dude!

I've had a gander at all the test accounts - Evolution and Revolution - and am generally pleased with the outcomes!

Taking the CORE, which was dismissed a couple of years ago - and turning it into something generally beneficial...is kind of kewl...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Evolution has come back round...

Given just over a month of testing with this and seeing that some of these trades have come back to roost - or, close enough to be closed out - gives a lot more insight as to what Revolution May Bring.

Holding around 50% Net Gains on a $2000 Account in a month...Nice!

All good, in the hood!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Revolution...

Closed another 100 Trades overnight and has found itself in a bit of a precarious position, with a couple of positions.

This does leave me with a little concern over the number of pairs that are in place, with the number of trades that this broker may allow...but...it still looks really fucking good, so ima just leave it alone...

Will hopefully have a good frame for data reference coming into the weekend and see where we go from there!

EHAW!

Another day under the Revolutions Belt...and what do we have??

A lot larger day for trading...that's for sure!

Nearly Double the Trades on Day 2 as Day 1 - Closed.

Increase in DD by more than 100%...but an increase in Gross Gains of close to 200% - Looking at the weekly...(Net gains - up from $13 to $86)

Given the number of pairs...easy to see that we are running pretty close to double the speed of gains over Evolution...but we also increase the risk factor, considerably as well...fun to watch out and I've actually shook a couple shekels of my own on live with Revolution overnight and into NY Close.

A Good Day!

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Now...that's all good with Revolution...but what about Evolution??

It is the only EA released for Public?

What's it doing?

Welp...actually even better.

Now...this is given that it has traded for a lot longer...but NET increase is up $286 and Return up a solid 2.5% from yesterday.

Cummon...for Free...it's pretty fucking decent...no?

The number of downloads of any EA or indicator...and then the number of people active with said product...

Currently - including my test account - we have a total of 9 traders that are sharing information on Evolution...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand 510 downloads.

Seems I have been getting lost in the moderation queue, I did write a reply to you offering me to test Revolution... maybe next version  But anyway - I have started up Evolution on my VPS, trade explorer is in my profile if you want to add to the list! I have tinkered a bit with some of my own ea's and am interested in the development of this!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I don't always catch everything... especially when posts fly and you are - as you say - lost in the moderation queue...but I do know that when I posted the offer, it was seemingly the catalyst to get you to sign up for an account at FF and attempt your first post. I gave you my word...as soon as I can reach out to your PM Box...I will keep the offer open to you for Revolution Trial.

Maybe not a well-known secret...and maybe I just know this because I may have been suspended here a couple times and allegedly signed up under alternate nicknames...but I think 5 posts is the Magic Number to get you out of Newbiesville and on with regular posting privileges...

Fire off a random shot or 2 or 6 more to get 10...and if I see ya without the New Member listing beside your nick in the morrow, will send you a Private Message with my email addy.

Throw down some charts of closed trades...whatever!

Let's get this party started!!

Alternatively...I do have my email address posted here at FF in one of my earlier threads.

There's only about 16, 000 more to go through...

Oh...added you to the first post!!

LIVE ACCOUNT!!

Go Man Go!

Funny Story...about being suspended here... heard it from a friend...yeah...that's it...a friend!!

lol

Soooooo...the story goes like this...my friend can be a bit of cunt sometimes...you know the type...always right when they should be wrong...maybe using profanity and grinding gears of some of the seniors...

Back before this Diamond system...there was a vouching system a +[whatever] number beside your nick to say how important you are.

lol

Well...my friend...didn't hold a lot of the >+10v members in high regard...simply because, being here a long time, didn't necessarily mean that they knew what the fuck they were talking about. In fact...some of the logic they used made as much sense about market...as monkeys flinging feces!

Seriously...some of the trades taken were soooooooooo bad...if you met up with them in a dark alley, you would beat them with the first, heaviest object you could find...

ANYWAYS...

My friend had signed up with so many New Nicknames during his suspension - as they kept getting flagged and banned - that the Admin Crew at FF had started suspending other actual posters with similar nicknames...

lol

Soooooooooooo...they ended up having to send an email to the FF admin...telling them that they'd suspended members for no reason and promise to wait out their time in purgatory...No new Alternate nicks.

Now...back in the day...not sure if they do it with this diamond shit or not...but when you get suspended...all of your +V's used to get wiped out!

So...being fairly well connected...my friend actually returned back to a +10v status...while still in suspension.

May not seem all that relevant or amusing to anybody now...but we had a fucking blast with it!

lol

This one is for DIGGER!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
GBPCAD...don't ever remember trading this fucker...but then again, I do drink A LOT of beer...

Really altogether not to familiar with it...but Revolution/Evolution sure don't want to be a buyer at this price...

So, after the initial blow up of my demo account, 150$ with two GU charts, one with 1M regular chart and the other a 2 Pips Renko chart, I got hold of another release, charged my account again and here are some of my observations.

This thing is a beast. Literally.

The EA on Renko took significantly less trades but was in overall less DD and profit is very slow but also very good.

On a regular chart while this beast is hammering its way onward it tends to drag some trades behind. Right now I'm on a -7$ buy trade (which is around 70-ish pips), all the other sells and buys have been closed but this is one lingers, not sure why as I don't understand the logic of the triggering or the closing very well.

With the current profit (around 20$-ish), I can close this trade and move on and I would have if this was my live account but we're testing this beast so I'm letting this one go. Let's see when it gets closed.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Well, I figured that someones got to take the leap and lean on this Revolutionary beast!  Just bumped up my pairs to 22   Demo is the place to try - so why not.  Will be interesting....

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Welp...

This looks a lot different overnight...

Maybe no need for that Rapid Recover EA after all??

--- 帖子 #380 ---
This...a good point!

And...I think something that a lot of people who try out EAs forget about.

There is ZERO issues in interjecting a little Manual into a world of Automated...in that...If you don't like a particular trade or pair...fuckem!

Don't use em or close em down!

Along with this...if you are Bullish and don't want the EA to start taking Bear Trades...set it to Only Buys...

When you do this, the logic still prevails, meaning, it's not just going to start buying because it can't sell...it will wait for the proper criteria to be met before it start to do it's thang!

Shut it off at daily roll over to prevent a couple of WHIPSAW trades to be entered in this 60 seconds...

Shut it off during High Impact News...

All things that you can add to your success, espeically if you just sitting back and watching it anyways!

Your account = your success!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Should be VERY interesting!

After almost 3 days...

Trading 19 pairs...

Closing close to 500 trades...

I'm still shocked that my tester only has 47 open trades!!

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Couldn't agree more, however, it is interesting to watch and I'm curious to see if this trade will be left orphaned or picked up by the EA's logic and consequently get closed with a bunch of other compensating trades.

I left it rawring at the top of the 1M down trend

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I just subcribed! I' m running 28 pairs on M1. I will let you guys know what happened.

As it turns out...there was a little tweaking that he as able to implement that I will be putting to the test...

Will be working on a couple other little changes that may make this a little bit better!!

Things are Looking UP for the REVOLUTION!

--- 帖子 #389 ---
...puuuhhhhh....

we all are waiting for jumping markets in order to learn what the Revolution will do, no?

For the Moment it stays impressive. Another 44€ "banked" in demo and the max DD is still

not very big. Honestly, I would like to give it a try on a real account, especially to see the

real difference on the same Broker.

Magix, is there any expiry or other problem when trying it on a real account?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Sneak a peak at a little bit of the personality lent by Sergien for Revolution...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Absolutely No Restrictions...

No Expiry Date...(though the thought had crossed my mind)

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Things are Looking UP for the REVOLUTION!    =         Thanks  Magix

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I get it...

I used to do the same...expiry dates.

This helped ensure audience participation.

You see...when we have more active testers, more pairs, more individual settings, it really helps speed up the progress.

When people ask questions, we all learn a little more about the tools we use...

Plus...there's almost ALWAYS something that can be tweaked, added or changed for these better mousetraps.  I been at this shit for a fist full of years now and I still ain't come across anything that resembles the Holy Grail...but I think we're getting close, right?

My biggest limitations are time and testing resources.  I've got 3 other ideas to get into testing stages, but...limited to the current accounts that I already have running.  The warden - AKA - My Wife - has a pretty tight handle on my hobbies...ie, buying a new server...so...unless I crowdfund a server or until I've churned the cash on my hobby bots...I sit back n wait...

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Definitely picking up and seeing the differences between Evolution and Revolution.

Evolution is more aggressive and is holding more DD with fewer pairs than compared to Revolution.

Evolution is running only 6 pairs with floating -$103, and Revolution is running 20 pairs with floating -$48, that's a big difference!

I'm really impressed with how Revolution is holding down, and after this test, and after analyzing the pairs I think reducing the pairs and increasing the lot size could work very well.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Magix you advised not trading during HIN, and also for those few mins when the broker time changes to the following day.

Do you think perhaps adding a news filter input to not allow trades during news, and maybe a filter input that will not allow trades to be opened on the roll over could improve things?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I appreciate your input!

Have seen what you have in live tests and can say, you've definitely got a couple of decent ideas yourself!!

There's a little more that I think I could add to help save from over trading the day or the range of day to help minimize the DD, but would have to get it written in and tested.

Along with that, and along with what bullilulli said, we haven't really seen range yet.

Really...there is a very specific reason that I started after the 3rd week of January with another Grid Project...

For the last several years, after December 15th and before the end of week 3 of January...I don't trade nor run EAs on live money.

Learned some very expensive lessons...

--- 帖子 #398 ---
All's quiet on the Western Front!

Typically speaking and because of market tendency coded into the trading logic, HIN and even the odd double hit on the daily roll, haven't made much of an impact on either Evolution or Revolution...that I've seen.

The biggest issues come when there is No NEWS.

When you take standard grid logic and most of the shit that people are playing with by way of automation...they are blind to trends and only look for triggers.

Read this a long time ago and has proven to be fairly true to date...

Traders can't Code.

Coders can't trade.

My logic is a lot of how I approach Live trade situations...so the fact that we see the success with both Evolution and Revolution is because they are trading, Like I DO.

I trade...but sure ain't that good with the Code...

Now...I obviously can't code in every specific candle or pattern that I work with...but I can adapt some restraint and logic into these to make them come fairly close to what I do.

That...and I focus on individual trade pairs that are working directionally...only during Active Sessions and keep close eyes on cross-correlating pairs.

I've tried to code some of this shit into EAs...little to no success and it takes a REALLY long time to test and see fail/weaknesses in logic.

In time...maybe a more selective play time...maybe a press filter...but those would be more specific for my individual testing than a broad spectrum trader for multiple pairs like we currently have in Evolution and Revolution.

Hi.

magix  how the ea will open trades?

I readed the code but dint understand how this work

--- 帖子 #400 ---
The source code version on post 1 - it just the Engine that Evolution and Revolution work with.

Triggering and profit logic have been adapted to my specs.

I included this so that anybody with an idea and the ability to Copy n Paste - could work on their ideas, like I did, with mine.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Magix, I'm new in this thread and first of all many thanks for this EA. I have a question: I closed the EA's due to FOMC (no live trading), but EURUSD made another trade in EURUSD. Why?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
No idea...

If you've disabled AutoTrading - no additional trades should be added.

I've never seen nor had this occurrence, where code logic could override control of the terminal.

This seems to be more terminal than code.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
REVOLUTION WooooW

Even with 0.50 per trade lool ( 15 pairs ) smoothly gaining , amazing EA chief

--- 帖子 #404 ---
The logic is the same - No matter what you set this too.

Lot size shouldn't make a difference...as long as the account has sufficient funds and leverage to continue to trade.

We're all still learning...but DAMN!

Looking good, dude!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I didn't disable Auto Trading, but only disabled "life trading" in the settings of the EA. Isn't that enough? Does the EA finish the trade(s), if Auto Trading is enabled? What can happen, if the EA works during FOMC?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Same Answer...

To the best of my knowledge...disabled on live settings or disabled Autotrading if you see -> in the top right corner of the screen...no trades should be taken whether there are existing trades or not.

It's like trying to boil a pot of water on the stove if you haven't turned on the element...no matter how warm the water is when you started...it ain't going to come to a boil.

If there's any other information out there that I'm not aware of...please feel free to weigh in.

Hi Magix,

I discover your thread and first of all, congratulation for your work. I have a question :

If I open a Cent account, do you think the Evolution or Revolution EA will work correctly ? beacause on cent account there 1.5 or 2 pips spread for eur usd...

I would like to test it in real account a shared the infos on your thread.

Thank's in advance for your answer,

Regards,

GregV

Hey Greg,

Welcome aboard.

Spread should make no difference. The pairs I have in test range from .4(ish) up to and as much as 6 pips during roll over.

We do have one member of our testing team that is working with metals and has even worked with Bitcoin...even with an ECN, I have to believe that spread is a little greater than 1-2 pips.

Additionally...profit is calculated on the sum total of spread, commissions and swap fees...so even when trades are carried over with a commission and fees...the EA knows to still monitor profit - when seeking an exit.

Look forward to seeing what you get in your testing!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Thank's for your answer.

You recommend me to test in first place the Evolution EA on real account ? or the Revolution ? or I test before using real money the Evolution on demo account ? (with renko and M1 chart ?

Regards,

GregV

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I recommend you start testing on a DEMO account.

This is the only way you will get an idea of the risks involved.

Revolution is still in - Beta Testing Stages - and with a couple of mods, not ready for public release yet.

Check out the first post, you can see a list of all members trading for time frame - Mostly M1 charts.

I am looking for a RENKO trader for Revolution - but since we really don't have any consistent data...if you want to be in a beta test group for Revolution, let me know...set up a DEMO account with 2pip brick size and will get'r fired up!

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thank's  ! I understand.

I will accept with pleasure to be a beta tester of RENKO REVOLUTION

Have some fun !

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Magix I've been looking at all active trades on Evolution and the DD seem to be coming from 2 pairs only. There are some orders in DD which I've noticed that are still floating for a while now, even though there are orders being opened, and closed on those same 2 pairs, it's like the EA has forgotten about them or not taking them into its' calculations. Take a look at the TE so you can see what I'm talking about.

I'm wondering if I should leave the EA to do its thing or perhaps just close them manually. I do know that its only a loss once you close it lol. I don't want to interfere with the EA if those trades are still part of the EA's plan.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Evolution and Revolution are not Static - they are Dynamic!

These trades have only been forgotten about because the market isn't showing directional weakness, in their favor.

Once a weakness is present, the EA counter logic will kick in...or, I guess I should say "Should Kick In".

It's kind of like the market gap that we seen on GBPCAD yesterday...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

See where the bottom side trade is...and the LARGE green square around, what could have been Long Trades...but at the top, is a Market Short.

The EA read the Daily Trend...realized that we are currently Overbought...

Looked at the trend throughout the day, and couldn't sell because there was no market weakness...

When the market Flattened...weakness detected and a subsequent short was taken.

This creates the Dynamic Ranges for trading...

Make Sense?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Now...

All that being said...

And

Has been mentioned...

If you are like me and don't want to carry open trades into the weekend...shut them down...take your weekly profit/loss and start fresh again at opening bells.

By not having a Static Grid...the Market can move FOREVER against the original trades...and sure it will carry some DD...

BUT!!

The Demise of ALL Grids and especially MARTINGALES is that they continue to add in trades against current trend based on a User Defined Static Number.

and then...

KABOOM!!

Now...admittedly...it can be fun to open a 100k account with a Martingale and Watch it make hundreds of percents per week/month (whatever)...but when you realize that:

1. No broker on the planet will open you a 100k account, with leverage, to have trade a ten cent lot...

2. Risking this is unbelievably crazy if you could...

3. THEY ALL EVENTUALLY BLOW UP ANYWAYS...

It becomes a lot more fun to see a couple hunny added to a smaller account, while you can still strap on your footy jammies and sleep comfy knowing that if this EA blows up...there are a lot bigger problems in the world for you to focus on!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Demo versus Live.

Demo was placed on the chart the day before yesterday, started trading during the night.

Live was placed on the chart today around noon and started trading since then.

Seems like the Time/Date/Market Behavior is also key here.

Both had around 10$ DD, Demo closed the Lone Trade during the spike up and the Live closed the shorts when it retraced back down.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Kinda...

You see...it's more like this...

The EA reads trend...

Meaning...if there wasn't a long on one account for it to try and cost average out...and the EA read the market as short...it wouldn't have taken any longs to begin with.

1.  Read market - Are we overbought/oversold?

2.  Read Trend - is the market in trend or is it showing market weakness?

3.  Look for an appropriate trigger.

4.  Rinse and repeat as necessary.

Now...

There is one thing that can have an impact on this...and along with, a set of basic instructions for our Newest Renko Tester - Greg.

Your terminal does need some history for it to be effective...and I know what your saying...last week I told you to delete all of your history to keep your shit running better...

This still rings true...

The amount of history that you need to have in place is only about a day!

So...

If you are launching a NEW Terminal - with no history, or working with Offline Charts...you will need to get them set up...let them run for a 24hour period

And Then

Launch!

Does this help explain what you've seen in your trade comparison??

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Sorry for not quoting, I'm on my cell and it's messing up with my keyboard.

No, it's not. You see, those shorts? They are kinda identical on both charts  so aside from that lone trade, everything is about the same  more or less.

So I'm not worried, the Raver is doing its thing pretty much the same on both accounts.

So to amend my previous post, there are differences but is to be expected and they are not off by miles.

As for the history for Renko, one can always fire up a 1M chart and leave the "home" key pressed till so the history gets loaded, faster than waiting for a day.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Great Tip...Thanks!

One more thing...I guess worth mentioning...

Though Demo and Live do trade relatively similar...they are not EXACT...

There can be differences in the individual candles - mostly only an issue when trading M1-M5 charts - M1 being the Most Sensitive

&

Spread.

During the whipsaws...there can be minute differences in spread from demo to live...giving them similar results...but again...not EXACT.

A little history...

Along these very same lines...

I worked with one of the EAs during development and it did, still actually does...fairly well.

Testing on a Demo account...

Running live...lead to a VERY ugly Draw Down situation...

It happens...

Soooooooooooooooo....

Wanting to take live to mimic demo...I used the Trade Copier from fxblue to clone trades from demo to live...

Still didn't get exact results...

But did get a lot closer.

Looking at your current open trades...you are well in excess of 100 trades - thus the remainder omitted comment at the bottom of your TE - to the public.

Annnnnnnnnd...have closed over 4000 trades.

I've been running Evolution for over a month now...though only on 7 pairs...and it hasn't closed 4000 trades...

And...altough Revolution is a lot more refined...it's trading 19 pairs and I've barely seen above 50 open trades.

There's something going on with your terminal...

And with EURUSD...no open trades...you've got a page worth...

1. Voldemar227 isn't Evolution...it's the generic code published by Voldemar227 - that you can edit.

2. Confirmed - Tickmill has a 200 trade threshold - per terminal.

Put the tma+cg into the indicators folder.

Put the Lost_Sock_E into experts folder.

Replace ALL EAs with the Lost_Socks_E...

Hey Dude,

Welcome to the thread!

As I would suggest to everyone...

Start off with the Thread Based Version - Evolution - on a DEMO account and get to know the risks involved - Folder available on Post 1 - DEFAULT VALUES - M1 Chart.

Link to my TE - HERE and Energetics is attached to the thread - Evolution - Post 1 also contains a list of other testers working with Evolution and Revolution.

Revolution - Still Beta Testing - will most likely see a few changes before a public release...will keep everyone posted as we progress.

Not to sound all cunty here...but I won't be doing another Charity Drive EA...

Here's the thing...

Charities are Organizations and run like any standard business...with exception of them not actually being able to be profitable...

Which Makes Total Sense...because money should be raised for their specific cause.

And...without wanting to say that most charities are Scams...they are!

After we did the Christmas EA and the Group at the other forum did another one...I started doing some investigating into some of the charities that were the recipients of our time and donations and was fucking SHOCKED at what I learned...

There was the top staff at charities making more money than were actually paying out to their cause...

Sum of funds for staffing and holding events so grossly exceeded the money that was passed along, it was mind-blowing...and disgusting at the same time.

It's almost quite literally the same if you wanted to donate money to homeless people, you buy a $2 bottle of pop, drink it and give them the bottle for recycling.

Seriously...

Nooooooooo...I know...not all are the same...

Like Red Cross, right?

Pshhhhhhhhhhhh!!

Google Red Cross + Scam or Scandal...these motherfuckers are HORRIBLE!

OR...United Way...

Or ANYTHING CANCER-RELATED!

All bullshit!

So...

Now...look in the commercial section of FF for a thread called - The Goose.

This was going to be another one of my Charity Projects...local Church that raises money for their specific goals...one of the things they used to do was to have the Younger Members of the Church go out and raise funds to sponsor kids to go on a trip to Mexico.

They would take 10 days - Drive from Canada through the States into Mexico - certain communities - and help build houses for the poorer communities.

Imagine being one of these kids that gets to do that...I mean, if you are looking for a rewarding experience...there it is!!

You get to work in the community and actually see the faces of the people whose lives you are changing!!

INCREDIBLE!!

So...I talked to one of the Church Seniors about my idea of driving some cash to help send a couple kids on their next trip...he was enthusiastic and brought the idea back to the Church...and then...

Instead of you...as the donor...being able to allocate where your donation went...they just lumped them all together!

As in...

Now that I was potentially going to try and work a little magic...they decided that they'd like to have control of the projects sponsored by my efforts.

Seriously!

Now...it takes time to run one of these Charity EA Drives...and a lot of effort...and then you have to continuously follow up with people and the onslaught of PMs and Emails and monitor on live and demo...

All for somebody else to reap the rewards...getting so little back to the intended...

FUCK THAT!

I work with a couple of local charities now...mostly foodbanks n such...donation of time and work with a few others...but that's it for me.

I can do more in a couple weeks with minimal effort than ever could in a few months of the Charity EAs...and actually see that I am helping out, not just a Feelz Goodz...

Sooooo...long story short...

If you wanna help out a charity of your choosing, I encourage it...but will not make it a qualifier for anything I release.

Hey Ben,

Welcome back!

Active members have their accounts posted on a Trade Explorer - we've added them all to the first post for reference.

This gives everybody who tests and wants to test, a fair idea of what's all involved...ie - Risk, pairs, equity required, brokers...

We have both versions posted for reference because, quite honestly, they're both pretty decent and until Revolution has a couple weeks in testing, we're really not going to know how it performs.

So...

If ya can...create a Trade Explorer and drop the link here...I will add it to the group.

Hi Magix

Never did that before but l think l got it: https://www.forexfactory.com/ben.des...xplorer.132789

But TE seems not same as my demo...don't know if l did something wrong...

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Yup...

Looks a little odd to me...

What do you mean the TE is not the same as the demo?  Are the balances different??

I Worked with another member today that had a similar looking chart...

Do you have the TMA+CG indicator in your indicators folder?

If not...trades come out to be a little bit fucked...and the equity curve matches what yours looks like.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Yes l have the TMA+CG in my indicators folder, The demo is working perfectly...It is the TE that seems different same as balance are more or less same...

EDIT:Just played with settings...seems more accurate now...let me know if it looks better...

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Yup...

Looks a little better.

Having 100k as a starting account size will take about 7 years to get you to a smooth looking equity curve...but as long as your broker keeps it going and your resources hold...you will have a frame of reference from this...

These were designed for a little more conservative accounts...$200/pair equity, kinda thing...that's what gives the following EC...but this is only sex appeal...by End of week, this fucker could be sloped 45 degrees in the Wrong Direction too...

--- 帖子 #459 ---

So, after talking to my broker, I got a hold of a another demo account.

Magix, This one is funded with 1000$, 200$ per pair and I'm thinking about running the R1.1 on USDCAD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, EURGBP and EURJPY all on a 2P Renko, unless you want something specific tested?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Magix, what happens, when the price goes away more and more from the entries and doesn't come back over a long time or never? In my case price is more than 100 pips away from the first entry last night.

Would it be too risky, to use 0,02 lots for 2000 € balance?

What is the best way to close the open trades before red news or the weekend without loss?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Magix hei.

there wase a bicg uptrend!!

way the ea selling?

Shold the ea need to sell with red and buy with blue

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I'm not familiar with the logic but why should it not sell in an attempt to find the retrace? I mean, if the overall day is short, than this "uptrend" may very well be a retrace and buying at the peak of it, and as you can see, the EA did try to sell the peaks, if the downtrend resumes than those trades are in a good place.

If not, than the EA would try to compensate and close out as soon as possible with small profit (default to 1$).

Just my observations.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Revolution isn't playing nice today, and the DD has almost doubled since yesterday. I'll keep monitoring, and I won't interfere with it as I want to see the EA do its thing, and handle the DD with its cost averaging logic.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Sounds good to me dude!

Let'r Rip!

--- 帖子 #466 ---
This is the learning curve with these 2 EAs.

It can very well move large distances away from the trades and you may get into a situation where you need to chop off a limb, to save the body...

From my Tester HERE
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This isn't even the worst I've seen...so...this account started at $2k and I've seen over $1000 in Draw Down...I would say, depending on the number of pairs you are trading, .02 lots on a $2k account, wouldn't be that great of an idea...

Closing trades without loss...before the weekend...that doesn't always work.

Again...some weeks you will be up, some will be down, you will need to decide if you are going to close based on this.

I've only got 1 Month under Evolution now...it's predecessor ran for 6 Months before getting into VERY LARGE DDs and even at that, would have survived all trades had it not been for a Stop Loss, and the logic never made concessions to close out portions of trades...so...there's that.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
The EA doesn't use the Hourly Close as a Frame of Reference.

This isn't a BIG uptrend...it's an expected retrace...see my forecast ->HERE from 9 hours ago...

And...will flip trends as necessary...

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Yup...ditto that!

My Rev is almost double the DD...and has had an EXCEPTIONAL amount of trades for the day...

Running at an average of 200 per day, we haven't seen the Full NY Session and we've already exceeded that...Still haven't exceeded 100 Trades holding with all pairs yet...that's pretty fucking kewl!

Hi all

My Revolution far ward testing on EU is trading well -- four days running and up and no trades open at present

Just so you know I am not intervening at all at this point. I am not stopping the ea at all. I am starting the ea to run on Sunday at market open and will be shutting the ea off this Friday just before the market close and I will be watching closely on Friday to hopefully shut down the ea when all trades are closed.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
From looking into the active trades its the JPY trades which are holding the most DD overall.

JPY strengthened a bit over the last few hours, and there are a lot of open JPY buy orders holding on. Hopefully things turn around and the EA can do some cost averaging and recover some of those bitches.

I'll leave it alone as I'm curious to see how it manages them.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
If mine can hold the under 200 trades into the weekend...will have a little more data to work with...to be sure.

Running 19 pairs doesn't allow for anything like a huge range on multiple crosses...Should've tested them on 2 separate...but maybe this gives an idea of which ones to put together and run on 2 accounts...

Overall...I'd be inclined to agree with you...

TDA survived and doubled a $3k account with only 7 pairs before being losing to a couple of stops...this logic, has the ability to basically double the pace and close out worst positions to possibly see that these the Draw Per Pair, may not have gotten to be to these same levels...

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Revolution didn't get caught by the northern spike on EU...

There was enough momentum for the logic to sit out this trend.

Not so much on Cable...but, well...nobody's perfect!

lol

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I've got a total of 9 trades in EJ and GJ...there's a couple of other JPY Crosses that aren't helping the bleed...

Overall, I'm not that optimistic for these to go to a bullish enough trend to close some of the worst trades out this week...but, anything can happen!

Still research n development stages...less than a week in play...meh.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi Magix,

Somes suggestions and questions :

1 : Do you know what type of scenarios is a nigtmare for Revolution ? and if you know it, is it possible to check in the history if this type of scenario have already occur ?

2 : If a nigthmare scenario have already occur in the past, what amount of margin/capital/news ideas is neccesary for trying to survive ?

I know you hate backtest  but for this kind of idea/research it can be usefull, what do you think ?

Regards,

GregV

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Good idea

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hey Greg,

Revolution is less than a week old...so, really, I don't have this information.

Evolution was based on another EA that I released - TDA...it was limited time trial in another FF Thread - shut off for the public on January 1st - My version I kept running.

TDA finally amassed enough Draw to Close out 2 pairs on a Stop Loss, after just short of 6 months of live testing due to Price Action you can see on this EU Daily Chart. There was enough retrace to load the boat...but not enough to close out ALL TRADES - which was mandatory for the TDA Logic.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The Revolution Triggering has been redefined from TDA...TDA having the EXACT same triggering as Evolution.

Revolution is a lot more refined in practice in that it waits for a momentum shift - Kinda...

The Largest issues in Forward Live Testing came because TDA had to close ALL TRADES before it would close any. When I shifted to the current core, it allows for the sum of the best trades, with the absolute worst trade, to be closed in Profit on an exit trigger. The idea, was simply to get the EA to lock in and close profit and wait for additional opportunities or a full-on trend reversal to finish closing out other trades in loss.

Now...there are some unknowns with Revolution.

There is a possibility, because of it's conservative nature in counter triggering, that it may not be able to have enough aggression to close out some of the worst positions...so, this needs to be put to the test.

A live test.

BACKTESTS ARE BULLSHIT!!

lol

And...for your particular circumstances - Renko 2p - There is ZERO complete data on TDA, Evolution or Revolution and the Backtesting on these fails even harder.

I do (reasonably guess) that $200 per pair with a minimum $2k account will survive my magic 7 pairs and this is what I've been playing with Live...I do interject some manual into my automated, so, even at this...can't really give you a full set of stats...just my best guess.

Shaken - Not Stirred...

F150>Minivan!

She tried to chase the dude down, but...well...criminals don't much obey the same driving rules in a stolen vehicle as you would in your own.

Shitty thing...as it seems...insurance doesn't like to cover vehicular damage done by stolen cars...

Baby was picked up...time for a cold beer, or few?

Thanks for the concern, dude.

How do you eat an elephant?

It's not like eating a fucking apple, you know...

An apple, you can sit and eat as a snack, before lunch, after lunch...pretty much anytime!

Funny thing about eating apples - and weight loss...

If you think you are hungry, ask yourself the question - Am I hungry Enough to Eat an Apple?

If the answer is yes...you are hungry...

If the answer is no...it's your body fucking with ya...

Anyways...Eating an apple and eating an elephant are 2 very different sized meals.

An elephant, to not get indigestion or explode, you need to eat in small portions.

Dafuqz this have to do with market??

Well...in the same way as we eventually want to match up all of our lost socks and if the goal is eating an elephant, this happens in steps.

Today, was an off day...

Sometimes you are the windshield...sometimes, you are the bug.

But the goal stays the same.

We're in a very RANGEY chop and as expected and has been shown with Evolution, there will be some DRAW...

But...like Evolution...we didn't get to 50% gains by trying to eat an elephant in one sitting...

It takes patience.

Sometimes...a little prickly armpit type patience...

But we will match up these fucking socks...and will eat that fucking elephant.

I should write for Hallmark, hey?

First, I'm glad it was only the vehicle that got hurt, I hope your wife is indeed shaken but will recover and will be back to boss you around as soon and as better as possible.

On a side note, I left the Raver on my Demo to handle the DD, two small buys smoothed some of the DD but still in a significant DD.

No Renko trades on the hybrid account and none on the dedicated Renko account, which is expected as the Renko trades significantly less than the 1M chart.

On my live account I have closed three of the most losing trades as DD approached 50$ on a 150$ account so I felt it was needed to stay afloat. No buys on this one, DD is around 30$ and balance is at 147$, hopefully it will recover.

Stay safe and well.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi Magix, hope your wife is ok mate. Incidents like that can really shaken up a person. Hope she is not discouraged from driving in the future

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Thanks guys!

Really means a lot when we all kind of pull together - here - as a family...

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Welp...

It was a long shot and basically a time suck for a week...given that, I knowingly can't continue with all of the existing trade pairs on a single account - for any Grid EA like the current.

Hasn't hit the threshold of 200 yet...but who the fuck would sleep with an account that has this kind of potential...

It's not the EA so much as the quantity of pairs in trade.

There needs to be some cushion for the account and margin.

Current account...doesn't have that.

Whether it survives 200 trades tomorrow or not...gunna kill this motherfucker and go back to the Magic 7...Survived on this for a lot of years, really not much need to walk outside the fences.

Kinda kewl to watch though...

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Ya, so far excellent!!  My M15 Evolution just pulled another wobbly and fired off a bunch of trades - not nearly as many as on M1 but still so weird!  Grasping at straws I bumped up the ram on my VPS as I know it was really bogged down showing near 100% usage a lot of the time as I have have Evo and 3 other terminals running.  When computers start using hard disk for ram some goofy stuff can happen so....  see if more ram helps anything.

All in all - most excellent!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Good that FF is back

My demo takes longs that my live doesn't. While I know we are testing it and demo is crucial for that, when the time comes, I highly recommend a period of testing on live, as well before going "official"

Had to close another two trades on my live account, on the spike down, there was an opportunity to close some of the recent sells but that would have left us with only the old ones that would still need to be closed, not sure if it's a bad idea as according to the logic as I see it, we would have gotten a few sells in a higher or same positions so we'd be better of with that.

And.... the All Renko took two very small trades! On EURGBP and AUDUSD both for around 0.5$ each.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
What if this is the answer to the 19 trade pair question??

Instead of a weekly close out of the basket of losers...do this daily?

I mean...every day for both evolution and revolution are seemingly profitable...but the mass accumulation, especially as related to 19 pairs, has drove my account under baseline...

Wonder what picture would look like if every day...once per day...we just shut down all trades and let it do its thang...

--- 帖子 #502 ---
That sucks!

Given the trade count on your M15...it actually looks better than the M1...

--- 帖子 #503 ---
210 trades closed on Revolution today...seems another exceptional day and looking over a few charts...w0w...Still NY into close...another 300 trade day?

Will we close above baseline?

Been a weird week...

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Magix despite the accumulating DD both on your Rev account and mine, they both still churning out the pips regardless.

My account is still floating -$500 in DD, but its pulled over 370 pips today, and its not done yet haha..

I'm still not interfering as this is very interesting to me to see how the EA is managing everything.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Magix-- glad your wife is ok

I have stopped my EU lost socks Rev with all trades closed and 2.5% gain in five days completely unattended and trading buys and sells all on its own.

I personally find this quite amazing -- May be just my inexperience with EAs but I have never seen an EA perform this well unattended.

you got a real winner here magixs. The only thing I see that could be a problem ( I know you already know this) is in a prolonged hard trend.

Have a good weekend all and thanks magix.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
The DD is really fuck all...ya know, when comes to Cost Averaging EAs...I mean really...it's draw on the account is about $50 and whatever is being used for Margin Requirements - from the week open.

I think if there wasn't a broker maximum number of trades in play, it'd be fine to run on...

Issue is...if we hit that cap and the account can no longer continue to gain, but amass more DD, shit can get pretty serious over the course of a single day.

From last night to today, we've increased the DD by over 200 and this is really only about $70 more than what we profited...which keeps the sexy equity curve and actual NET draw, low.

Shockingly...123 trades in play...this still amazes me!

If it were just 7-10 pairs...and still $200/pair floated per trade - Minimum $2k account - I think we'd be fine.

Will continue to watch some of the other test accounts and ponder over the weekend anything I may have missed or can improve.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I guess what I'm saying is...

This could have effectively run, as a cost averaging EA, on 19 pairs for an entire week, on $1000 in, with 500:1.

Seeing what can happen with Evolution and having to beef up an account with another Grand just to make sure that I would survive...kinda made me thing that Revolution would need the same.

But if we can prosper, 7-10 pairs - $1000 in...you could have a few accounts consistently churning, with several of the micro dogshit brokers...

And like iamsovereign said...just leave it unattended...

There's always going to be risk...no matter what.

But if we can minimize risk...carry 7-10 traders per account...mix shit up a little with different pairs...keep the same equity curve...that'd be alright.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I don't think that would be wise as it eats away both equity and more important, balance.

You might find yourself chopping off more than needed because you think so and the EA might go into a tumble of sorts.

Killing those five trades on my live account meant that I am left with less than 200$/pair, on terms of recovery, it might not be a good idea.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
By scrambling the pairs instead of keeping all eggs in one basket...we are effectively hedging loss on trade pair(s), with profit.

Some that consistently churn this week, will be the dogs next week...and vice versa...the dogs may turn into the profit churn.

Trend...press...global events..all this shit taken into consideration, keeping a few irons in the fire is seemingly the way to go.

Haven't added any of the CHF pairs to my accounts, so will look to others for stats.

I've never had much luck in sorting out the personality of these pairs, more so just the standards.

Maybe 2 accounts instead of 1 next week...keeping all same pairs in trade, but, having the spread out to 2 accounts to try and ensure we never hit that 200 cap.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Fair point...

It'd prolly take me as long to work through 19 pairs from this week figuring out where they would be now if I would have closed them down each day at some random time, than actually would to test the theory on another account...

Shitty thing is...

If I want 19 pairs spread over 2 accounts...still want to keep my Evolution Running...and have a 19 pair account that I closed trades off every day, with a couple of other private projects...I'm definitely going to need a new server.

Thanks to the Cocksucker that hit n ran yesterday...I'm facing a little extra financial burden that will put a bit of a time delay on getting me a shiny new server.

Maybe have to extend the group of revolution testers?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
You should, I think, get a group of 20 people testing it, we need statistics.

I would also look into separating the buys and sells terminals, remon used to say it is better with his grid idea and the engine is based on it so go figure, maybe it's worth a try as I can clearly see both buys and sell in my demo and not on my live accounts, maybe if there wasn't an overall sell bias it would have fared better? Is it something your added code deals with?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
With exception of requiring additional resources, pc and margin-wise - if running live - I don't see that'd there'd be any difference.

His was a blind grid that only took range into consideration...

Evolution and Revolution are more directionally biased with a few cost averaging rules written in.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I know  was just a shot in the dark.

I wish there were some more sells in one of those peaks, though

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I dunno man...

Even as conservative as Revolution is...if it was buying all of the Spikes down, would look a lot worse.

10 trades deep on longs - $90+ in DD...Just EJ alone!

Really, not terrible...but could look a lot worse.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Back above water!

w00t!!

lol

1100 trades for the week, still a fist full of hours remaining...

Very interesting week!

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Part of the problem with running a mixed EA account is that some trades are going to get missed out while analyzing the entire batch.

Those buy trades? They were on Renko, so actually, according to the logic, we only had sells on the 1M and no buys.

Pity my broker doesn't allow for a lot more demo accounts, could have tested the Renko and 1M head to head on two different terminals.

So far, I need 15$ on my mixed account and around 30$ on my live account to get to the starting balance.

The pure Renko is still silent after those two trades. One of them was able to go a lot longer, Magix, just saying.

But profit is profit.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Think I have the idea behind 2.0 figured out...

Will work on it over the weekend.

Think I can improve the odds and reduce the DD...to help keep the same number of pairs in trade.

Might need a couple kicks at this cat...but I am excited by the data and testing this week!

Got a little of this shit figured out!

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Oh...

And thanks to all of the current Testers of both Evolution and Revolution - who are sharing data!

Your participation in these early stages is GREATLY APPRECIATED!

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Very nice, got a couple of sells at one of the peaks so DD has been reduced drastically (again, with those five most oldest trades removed).

Mixed demo is also at around 50$ DD, was 80$ DD before I went to walk the dog.

All and all, if you have the balance to carry this one through, it's a hammering machine.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Not that I throw a lot of faith into these here backtest things...

But since I now have a way of observing Draw when running...it would seem that $250 has been the most extreme I've seen on the one pair...

Much testing to be done, but I think this pretty much confirms what I've been saying...

Run Multiple Pairs - $200/pair...Minimum $2k account.

Not everything is going to be hitting the skids at the same time so as one is failing, the other requires less margin...until they eventually reverse.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Figured out a piece of code that has been fucking with me...going to be making some changes to Revolution to be a little better for profiting in and out of trend.

Learning as I watch the motion of the market!

Booyeah!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
If backtests are to be believed...and they aren't...Revolution 2 should be titled "The Prophecy".

My dick is already hard for next week in market!

Triggers make sense...

Logic makes sense...

More than a comparative scale on Backtest Bullshit, but actual analytical time on historical charts, looks GREAT!

And...Some of the adaptive ranges can be applied to Revolution!

Auooooga!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Testing Prophecy on adaptive ranges to Time Frames...

Seriously the closest to an AI EA that I've done.

Hold on to your butts!

We got some good stuffs coming!

Going to shoot for a public release of new adaptive ranges and profit logic version of Revolution for 2 hours prior to market open.

If you have a Tester up on page one with the original...it will be in your email.

[quote=Ezzy;10811448]

We all have our own trade philosophies and methodologies...

Some work...

Some...Not so much!

I started into this with an original idea - Trigger Ranged Dynamic Entries.

Meaning...cost averaging, like a grid, but with a bit of logic involved.

Moved on from a Standard Grid take profit, into a more Dynamic Ranged exit...

This all worked out, fairly well...barring exceptional circumstances and as long as you restarted every few weeks, you'd easily survive...

So...how to adapt?

Is it on indicators?

Grid Range Space?

Time Frame?

All of the Above?

Even More?

FUCK!

The more you do...the more you need to do. But...the more you do, the more you also understand, so, really, no loss!

Every new step I take, is a celebration of graduating the previous...and it opens up whole new worlds of ideas. Some, ideas from the past and how to incorporate, some altogether new.

I've made some fantastic money working with my little grid traders...lost a lot too...but, still going.

Like a fucking Timex...take a licken, keep on ticken!

As long as the overall gain, stays above the original equity, we are all good, in the hood!

What I've seen with Evolution...is pretty kewl!

Steady equity climb, not much by way of Diminishing Returns - each week is steady gross gains and after a set point DD - stability.

Revolution - next step ideas applied by greater range dynamics shows an impressive restraint when adding additional pairs equating into additional profit...seriously...double to triple profit of it's predecessor in the same span of time? That's pretty awesome in itself.

But...the number of trades per pair sucks! Limited to broker max.

Now...maybe next week, not so much...

Prophecy...

The idea to take the same equity curve and reduce the DD for continued gains ->dick = HARD!

That's the shit!

Oh...and...market is closed...

I'm right fucking hammered!

Most of my best shit comes from this state of no inhibitions...the evolution of my traders is the evolution of me.

Which means...if I came up with my best work, while I was hammered...and I most probably did...now that my ideas have evolved, why change my state of being??

Cheers, Mate!

Went for a meeting at the bank with my father...

He was wanting to invest some funds...we're all getting on in age and to him, it's still a matter of "He who dies with the most marbles, wins".

So...go man go!

The investment brokers we spoke with, have a "Target Yearly Gain" of like 4%...which...in bag loads of cash = more bag loads of cash!

BUT!

They want a brokerage fee and monthly fee...to the point of...if they did succeed in gaining you a bag load of cash, they'd be taking 2-3 bags with them...

Though you can pat yourself on the back for "Investing Wisely", you need to give your head a shake because all of that simply means, you are losing more per year than you can ever expect to gain.

If they WIN - They Profit!  Good Deal!

If they LOSE - They STILL PROFIT!

WHAT??

That's how this shit works...on a smaller scale, build more equity into a smaller account and grow continuously without the Help and Charges of others.

Small steps now, really are, large steps for later.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Nedge...your way to profit!

What the fuck is a Nedge?

Great Question!!

It is what most traders consider a "Hedge", in that they are buying and selling the same pair at the same time.

When you sit back and think about this...you try to imagine where and how do you profit?

And rightly so!

Buy and Sell, market goes up...you exit your longs and hold your shorts...market keeps going up, you are holding only shorts, it consumes your threshold for risk, you exit aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand you're a loser!

Well Done!

So...why would anybody do this??

This too is an Excellent question!

The profitability of Evolution, Revolution and even Prophecy depend on some factor of Nedging.

They will take prosperous trades, directionally, and do their damnedest to keep in trend, but let's be serious, what the fuck is the trend to an M1, 2 pip Gridded Chart?

Exactly...makes no fucking sense at all...

BUT!

If you take and look at the equity curves provided...though the accounts may only be up a couple bucks, they also have a pretty fantastic equity curve...meaning, as price moves against where they profited and into the waters they hold Nedged Trades, this value will continue to increase and potentially never run into a factor of diminishing returns...

Check it out...

Seriously...Check it out ->HERE .

15.2% Gross Gains on a $4k Account holding $581 in DD, with a total Net Increase in Value of...$26 bucks!

After 1, 128 Closed Trades in a week, over a hundred more holding the Draw in place...

So...what happens when some of these chickens come home to roost?

More profit...that's what.

19 pairs in trade, gridding with a minimum of 2 pips between trades (Logic Adjusted), and the drawdown is only $581 while Gross Profit is $606...

When these trends reverse...and they will...the logic will remove the losers by way of profit on an 80+% win rate, stack up the cash in the following direction, while continuing to selectively hedge!

Evolution started with $250/wk average Gross Gains...

First week of Revolution - $600 Gross Gains??

Do the math...where's that leave you over the next 6 weeks?

--- 帖子 #530 ---

I have recently set up a vps service. I would like to contribute with the work done here by linking a TE and sharing results. What do you suggest may be more helpful to test? Evolution, revolution, prophesy? Happy to have specific settings or my own experimental settings for the group to see.

Fair point...

But at the same time...are you in need of your Forex Cash as liquid on a daily basis?

I mean, really...if you have money invested into market, as long as sufficiently covered, does it matter?

Kinda like this...

As you only partially pay attention, the one thing you've noticed, is a shit ton of trades...but maybe missed the fact that even with a shit ton of trades, there's still a net gain on the account of 50% or taking $2000 and making it $3000...

So...what you'd be actually saying is that if I was to knock on your door, once every 6 weeks and deliver a check for $1000...you'd probably turn me away, right?

Yeah...sure ya would...

But...again, still a fair point.

A lot of accounts in Forex and especially here at the factory hit the skids hard and fast because people start to lose their threshold for Draw Downs after taking a market beating...

So...what if we could effectively hedge the space instead of actually filling the gaps with what may have been in trend trades, but now positions that look terrible in an account?

Funny thing...I think I can do this too...

Having an appreciation for a Rebounding Market and seeing how trend trades, even when trend reverses, still come up square can be profitable over a period...what if I am more selective in when I work with the trend?

Sure...there's still going to be some risk in a choppy market and there are trend reversal headfakes...but, with a little better profit logic and a more selective position triggering, I think this problem can be eliminated.

Dropped such a filter into the logic behind Prophecy and well...may not churn zillions of pips per week, but at the same time...after 1100+ trades and $606 gross profit, Revolution only came away with a fist full of Net Dollars...

Will see how they stack up in a head to head, next week.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Yup...totally aware of both discounts on VPS space with brokers and familiar with just having some space on a VPS...

Problem is...

Toggling the screens and the fact that I am a control freak - running twins for monitors now...just keeps things easy for me.

Why bother with dodgy latency when I can find something a little more suitable for home use?

But...great suggestion, dude!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Will fire you off a PM when I finish getting things together.

I think one more week with a control group - making some changes to the logic - might be a little better for the long run.

Why rush at this point?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
No probs mate .

I'll leave free space on the VPS.

As I said, happy to complement the testing that is already occurring by others.

Version 1.3 - Revolution sent off to testers.

2 New accounts added to my profile for testing:

1.  Prophecy - No Nedge Logic - added.

2.  Revolution - No Nedge Logic - added.

Prophecy is only trading the Magic 7 - I don't expect a lot of action on this account over the week...but

Revolution - back to 19 pairs.  With No Nedge added, wanted to have enough irons in the fire to see if I get any action.

Looking forward to an interesting week!

--- 帖子 #541 ---
For shits n giggles, I added the No Nedge Logic to Revolution...

It's a trend/counter-trend trader in that it looks for a trend change in the current while observing the overall trend and waits to counter.

While both Evolution and Revolution have a Daily OBOS filter built into them, No-Nedge more so looks to assume a homeostatic directional bias.

Trading commonly longs to short and shorts to long to pivotal median dynamic chart ranges - as the immediate trend shifts.

In doing this, additional triggering has been added - quite possibly making it a little riskier.

Additionally, the same profiting logic from Revolution 1.3 has been added.  The idea...be a little quicker to react to price spikes and a lot quicker closing in against the immediate trend trading.

Again and due to the wait period of Trend and Immediate Trend Shift...there will be some delays in pair trading - Even as an M1 trader.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I got my explorer up with Revolution V1.3

This forward test is with EU pair only with starting balance of 2K  and using 0.1 lot on the M1 TF

I will be letting this run unintended till Friday -- this should be interesting for NFP week.

Thanks Magix

NFP is next week...but!

That being said...week prior to NFP and NFP Week are both typically decent grid trade weeks...

Link changed on the first post.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
So Magix, Rev v1.3 is different from Prophesy, and I'm guessing as v1.3 also does not have the no nedge logic which is in Prophesy?

Don't want to get confused now with all the versions/updates lol.

P.S. Rev V1.3 TE has been uploaded to my profile.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Yeah...I know...can be a little confusing with too many things on the go...much the reason I only like to release 1 version at a time.

No-Nedge has only been added to 2 of my testers and until I see the reality of it, it's just an idea.

Prophesy...this needs to be tested for logic before a release, so, have 2 test accounts with TEs on my profile so we can all watch...there's bound to be something I fucked up in these, I never get this shit right on the first attempt...

So that leaves us with Revolution 1.3 - only has different exit logic added - the version sent out.

Seen your TE and added to post 1.

I don't think that this is your tester nor terminal...but, believe it might be a broker spike...

Price is based on bid/ask for sells/buys...in much the same way as we can see some double taps with these EAs at roll, during exceptional market times, we can see a widened spread and multiple trades.

Thanks Magix,

Here is my demo of v1.3.
https://www.forexfactory.com/energetic#acct.21

This time I am not using your magic 7 pairs. Using a $2k account, I am trading 10 pairs and a majority of them are AUD cross. Let's see what happen in this big news week.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Morning guys,

V1.3 took several buy trades, not sure why as it looks like it's taking them at the peaks, however, all of them came through and made some profit which is a bit worrying as the DD on the V1.1 sells is increasing as the trend progresses.

No Renko trades on my mixed demo account, three trades on two pairs on my Renko demo account.

V1.3 on 1M on both demo and live took the exact same six trades, all buys, all in profit. No previous sells were closed.

Magix,

Can you add into the "Open orders" section the MagicNumber and UserComment, please? Just eye candy and only if you have the time.

Revolution is getting close to max trade limit on my account. Once it hits the 200 trade limit I wonder how it will affect the EA's performance?

Revolution 1.3 is also a beast. This version has been firing off orders since last night and is already over 100 trades.

I'm at work so I can't upload images, I hope I'll have time to it this evening.

This. Is. Impressive.

All my 1M charts carried a huge (for me, at least) DD, the Mixed Demo carried around 150$ in DD and the Live carried around 80$ in DD, all the while The RaverV3 took small nips at the uptrend in the form of buy trades that got me thinking it ditched the sell trades or we're going to face a prolong period of time before any would get closed.

Boy, I was so wrong. Right at the top of the peak the RaverV3 took a sell that closed some of the older sells and DD was reduced by 60$ in each account.

If it would have taken another buy both account would have been wiped out. Not sure how the logic is applied here but if this is something to be expected than Go Raver Go! But if not than maybe we can create this Magic(x)?

This is mui fun to look at.

Hey Dude,

Welcome to the thread.

$500 is not a terrible start, but, so far and depending on pairs, everything that I've seen these trade on, Minimum $200 per pair with a minimum $2k account is seemingly a good static place to start.

Will be working adding more testers to the newer logic as we proceed.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
1.3 has the same triggers for trades and given the amount of pairs you have in action, been a BIG DAY for trades...to be sure.

The idea in modifying the closing logic was to try and escape some of these a little quicker than the original version...hopefully we see this happen...but in bigger and brighter news, this same trigger when applied to the No-Nedge idea, seems to be kicking some ass today - churning in green and keeping the trade limits lower...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

19 pairs on the go, each pair has closed at least one trade or set - currently, 121 closed trades 17 open and we still have the same upward sloped EC we want to see.

Maybe this is one of the changes needed?

There is one additional thing I can do to help minimize the risk - Remove the third triggering, but will leave it in play for the next couple weeks - Trade Quantities Pending...and will see where we go!

Maiden Voyage for Prophecy...

Overall...Meh...

Lots of market chop for this one to get caught in and given the logic that is behind...will take some time to see if this works in as good of live trade situation as logic seemingly made through the tester.

Some minor difference so far...should be able to get some of this cleaned up by code.

There's definitely something to this whole - No Nedge Logic...

19 pairs in trade, coming into the end of the first full day of trading - 2 pip minimum grid, 129 closed trades, 712 - NET CLOSED pips...

And, then...holding a DD of $.86 on 18 trades.

Great Example of the New Closing Logic on Revolution, Revolution NN and Prophecy.

Hold out for a little more when in Trend Trading!

Normally, trade would have been triggered out in the red circle...but not this time!!

Run you motherfucker, RUN!!!

lol

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Few more examples of the trend/out of trend exits.

All the Red Circles are out of current trend exits.  Logic looks for the first and fastest exit to not continue dragging dogshit on its shoes...(first opportunity in profit to close out the worst positions)

There was enough chop in market to scrap all of it off...and the green circle trade, was delayed in exit...price still moved on, but better to have closed net profit than to sport poo on the shoe.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi Magix,

Nice work! I must say that the TE is looking a lot more green today including mine. What settings have you used for LSE EA for the 2 pip grid trader of you dont mind saying..

Hey Guys!!

I just added Revolution 1.3 to post 1 for public testing.

Have Fun!

Check out the other tester accounts to gauge for pairs and account sizes.

Let me know if you have a Trade Explorer to add to the thread!

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hey Dude,

Everything I test is M1, unless otherwise specified and these are ALL DEFAULT settings.

No adjustments needed, but do feel free to play around with them.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Magix have you ever tried or considered increasing the "minimum profit close" to $1.50 or $2?

Do you think this could have a positive effect or be a good idea?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
It absolutely could...I've just found that eating an elephant is easier in smaller bites.

Adjusting the Closing will have some impact, but increasing the range and especially as applied to larger timeframes could prove to be a lot closer to what you see as a more ideal - risk to reward.

Check out Telac's M15 account...
HERE

You'd have to confirm with him, but pretty sure he adjusted to $2 and given the Ranges of an M15 chart, seems to be doing quite well...

This is Evolution...imagine what Revolution or NN could do?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Cool thanks cos I'm getting some ideas lol.. I'm thinking of running a M5 account and increasing to $2 and see what it can do.

By increasing the range you mean the "step order" input right?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Not actually to do with settings...more to do with Trigger Ranged Dynamics.

These have a Minimal Step - Trigger on Grid

&

Have a minimal profit - In Sets - Dynamic, Not Static.

So, if these are playing on a longer time frame, the actual range of movement is greater.

Coded in, is logic to, try to only take one trade per candle, but we have seen some failures on this...Telac was having the issues with this on an M1, and I would guess due to a whippy Bid/Ask line with his current broker, or perhaps just an issue with the terminal itself...this is the reason that he migrated over to an M15 chart.

Since then, I don't think he's seen the same issues and given the low amount of trades over the last couple weeks of running, seems like this resolved.

Now...other side of the coin...

Vipbabariya is running an M5, I would believe to be on Default Settings, but he'd have to confirm.

If this is the case, equity curve still looks decent for a couple weeks in, does have some draw - not like what we see on the M1, but it's there...and hasn't seemingly captured the same sort of profit.
HERE
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So...increased range, increase profit requirements to make sure that you get a little more out of the trade sets.

When looking through the charts today, I was analyzing how this may play out on the longer time frames to maybe code a longer trader...

Can be done...just not necessarily with the same NN version.

NN - In actuality, probably won't work for shit on anything longer than an M1 - due to the NN specific Logic...I'd have to make this an external variable to get the same sort of thing, but the ideas and methodology behind this, don't really seem to translate well on the longer timeframes...would have to try for something different...

--- 帖子 #582 ---
As for a larger trade size...

iamsovereign is running a $1 lot HERE .

Glad he's got this on Demo - not something I'd be willing to try, just yet!

--- 帖子 #583 ---
The biggest issue with testing these, especially for me and even when I involve a group...

I'm as flighty as fuck!

I've got a new idea, every 15 minutes and want to see how it will play out...much the reason for needing a New Server for these motherfuckers!!

Getting a few involved, has been a Fantastic Asset...

But given that there have been 658 downloads of Evolution and only a fist full of testers...
Attached Image

Easy to see why data is a little scarce.

Not enough participation...I take some responsibility for that...

But also why I try to keep the same testing group 1 file ahead of the general public.

As I am not selling this shit...I need a solid core group to help me keep some eyes and ideas flowing.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Actually it's trading .1 lots with $20 minimal profit close....  There were a few of those rogue trades in this that in the end made the profit bigger but nothing like the M1 tests.  Sweet results I'd have to say!

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Even Better...

Scaled down...$300 account start, $.01 lot sizes, $2 profit = $50 per week beer money!

So...

Looking at Evolution...typical gross gain per active trading day is about $50...

At the current speed, by Tuesday of Next week - This motherfucker should churn 100% Gross..that's kind of exciting.

Most likely a wait for DD to fill in the spaces, but all the same...

Hi all,

Things seem to go well. Rev 1.1 is over water now and still earning Money every day.

Check the TE running since 19.02.2018. Everything Default and on M1 TF.

To collect some more and "easytocompare" data I set up three new TE today.

First on is running LSR 1.1 - You find it HERE

Second one is running LSR 1.3  - You find it HERE

and the third one is running LSR NN- You find it HERE

All of them started with 3.000 € and use the same 13 pairs on TF M1.

They are running on the same Broker and VPS. Hope this helps to compare the versions.

I tried to start them in the same time, maybe I lost some seconds.

As Long as I have the space on my VPS I will leave the "old" one running.

I've been taking a deeper look at the 3 TE I have running, Evolution, Rev 1.1, and Rev 1.3.

What I find interesting is that Evolution is still kicking ass. It's just over 2 weeks in, and already 50% growth on the account, and with relatively normal DD for running 6 pairs. It's taken more trades than Revolution 1.1 and v1.3, but its been holding down the DD pretty well considering.

Rev 1.1 and Rev 1.3 have been also been doing really well. The DD has been quite a bit higher on v1.1, but its recovered some of it, and is looking good. It's much less aggressive in opening orders than Evolution, and is still doing well for running 20 pairs. v1.3 is too early to say too much, but its also kicking some ass in the short amount of time.

It will be good to see the final results of the 3 versions after 1 month of 24/5 trading and then compare.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Revolution was written to be a little more conservative in both the primary and subsequent triggering and even when it detects the Market Weakness...

The reason for more trades with your Revolution accounts over Evolution...more pairs...more risk...more DD...but the DATA is KEY!

I've always stated that Each Currency Set has their own independent personality...the 7 that I trade are definitely the ones that have the closest in personality, much the reason that these play a little better by the rules.

There are a couple of others that may still fit in nicely, but given that I've only mostly studied my Magic 7...I can't really say which.

Then comes to things like spread and pip profit, market movement...all factors in a Dynamic Grid.

With ya on the reflection of a Month worth of trading though.

Just looking at my Evolution Demo and a couple of the others that were early runners is impressive.

I think NN will begin to shine a little brighter, but still need to assess how Trigger 3 will play into this.

On a personal account, I've written in a version without the 3rd trigger, so, should be more of a TRUE No-Nedge version of Revolution.  With this, there will be some loss in overall profitability, but the idea is still to reduce the risk meaning a smaller account size and increase the profit based on percentage.

I like to have a few personal accounts on the run, keep em small...if they can continue to churn some profit, all good...move profit to another account and keep em growing.  If they blow up...fuck em...move on!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
What is under the hood for NN?

Here's an idea...

Looking at the trades of Evolution, we can see that we are stuck with Buys at the Top and Sells at the bottom and a Median Line that we move back to.

No Nedge looks to observe this homeostatic line and trend towards it, when the immediate trend shifts to it.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

No...Not counter trend...though it may get caught in some of the whippy action...it assumes that price will gravitate towards a profitable median, when the daily chart is turning on the M1 Chart by trend definitions.

No sells below the median - wait for buys.

No buys above the median - wait for sells.

When the market is against it, we are still accumulating trades under the same logic of Revolution - with the REV NN version - (Not released yet).

The idea...let's look at the best chances of not accumulating massive amounts of trades...

Both Prophecy and Revolution versions of NN are accumulating positions now...will be interesting to see how these play out!

Just thought I'd lend an idea of what I was looking at when working on the logic.

Hi Magix

How are you?

Just to let you know l am still testing evolution on 8 pairs, ,01Lot... since 2.5 weeks same as l am not in your list...

Actually l have the biggest DD ever... 826$ with 83 trades opened so far…

As you know a Demo account doesn’t acurately calculate margin cost involves on live account…

Then l do it manually on regular base on excel sheet to give me an idea on how much money l would need if one day l decided to go live with evolution…

At that moment 4K live would be needed to survive with 8 pairs, ,01L...For a net gain of approx 100$/weekly...if that pace subsist…

Do you think evolution is able to handle a really long trend...as we know majority of grid ea’s failed when the trend is to heavy…

l think the chalenge is really there…

Anyway my demo won’t die soon then l will continue testing…

Hope my feedback was helpful…

Continue your good work...it is fun to be part of a nice team like this...

Have a good night guys

True Test of Trigger 3.

My Live Private Version - No Trigger 3

vs

Test Account - with Trigger 3...

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hey Ben,

The Triggering logic for Evolution was tested on a Previous EA - TDA - Stats are posted somewhere in the thread...

It ran for 6 full months with an account start of $3000 and eventually doubled the account before hitting 2 Stop Losses for $1000 ea on EURUSD and GBPUSD.

If there was no Stoploss in place, they would have actually recovered.

The difference between Evolution and TDA is that Evolution will work to close out the worst trades, where as TDA logic was to only CLOSE ALL when the sum of all trades was either greater than profit, or hit stop loss.

In 6 months, 7 pairs, $3000 - it ran smoooooth...

By that, I mean that it never got to a 200 Trade Max Threshold by Tickmill and never hit a point in margin where couldn't take any more trades.

Now...we did see some pretty serious trends in December through January, where the EA finally tapped out, which is much the reason that I am working with the current core.

By closing some trades down periodically, instead of trying to carry all to profit, the theory is, we may not have hit that Stop Loss value.

It's a theory...

Best Guess...really...

But in all seriousness...anything can happen.

If you look at my previous post and albeit a little different logic than just Evolution or Revolution, I am gambling about $1100 on 14 pairs!

Pure fucking insanity!

Just going off of what I have seen in these and with a little bit of a safety net, I think that I will be able to make up my mind if and when I ever want to close all trades and cash in my chips.

What you do with your personal account, it's all you.

One more thing I'd like to add...

Since mentioning the Charity Thread...I've had a couple of inquiries as to where or how people can donate to me.

So...to help clear the air on this...

1. I don't now, nor have I ever taken any of the donations from the charity thread. The user was to select a charity of their choice.

2. I have mentioned a crowdfund on this...(New Test Server) but in all honesty, I just don't think it's worth the time...

3. I do appreciate the offers...seriously, it's not that I don't like free money, but these are Hobby Bots for me...I've got a few accounts that churn and I honestly, don't need the money. The wife let me get a Mercedes Last year, 8 months after buying another car...she's understandably (and not looking over my shoulder as I am typing this) keeping my hobby extras to what they can provide.

4. I am not selling anything! If you want to be a part of the test group, start providing some stats...this shit is FREE!

--- 帖子 #611 ---
So...what if you wanted your own No Nedge version...

Well...until it's tested, good n proper, no release, so you either wait it out Oooooooooooooor!

You can work with the current tools, interjecting a little Manual Workings...

Example.

This is a USDCAD chart, fairly strong uptrend and moving at a decent clip...so, let's say you plotted out an area, like the one on the chart - Weekly Resistance.  That seems a decent place to sell if price gets there...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here's whatcha do...

Set the EA to Only Sell, once it starts looking toppy...

Oh dear gawd...what if you are wrong??

Don't panic...this EA will not Start to SELL immediately once it's set...the Trend Still has to change, to a short immediate, based on the logic programmed in.  Meaning, if price crushes through this zone, there's a very good likelihood that you won't see a Sell taking place until the trend starts to weaken and eventually change.

Be the same on any other chart you look at...H4 or Daily...weekly if you have that great of sense...and will also work on Buying...if there's a chart bottoming...in your opinion, set the EA to Only Long and when the trend starts to shift...it will start looking for Long positions.

TADA!

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hey John,

Depending on what pairs you have it set on, there are a lot that are in a state of Overbought or Oversold - by the daily definition of 1.3.

Meaning?

Because OB pairs are still moving up, or OS pairs are still moving down, the EA won't start trading until it gets a sign of reversal.

Now...

If you wanted to have some fun...

Set the Magic Number to 0 - (zero) - and take the first trade for it.

ie, buy Cable or Fiber or the Dragon...

Sell EURAUD or USDCAD.

Either for shits n giggles, or when you think these are ready for a turn.

With 0 as the magic number, the EA logic will recognize it as a trade to start working on and will either close it in profit or grid it out for ya.

I've got one version of logic based on Revolution Triggering - I've nicked GridMeOut, where there is no primary trigger...so...it will continue to trade out any shit manual position by cost averaging and once all positions are closed, will stop trading.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Not a lot of chop for it to get tested...

Same logic as Revolution for triggering - only 1 real difference in that it doesn't have the same OBOS filter as Evolution or Previous versions...but...

It does have a median target and only looks to trade towards it.

EURAUD played funny yesterday...went from a short rapidly, no trade opportunities into a long trend, no trade opportunities...too much of a tight area for anything to be found.

A lot of other pairs...so much of a state of market flex, it just sat out...

Pleasantly surprised by my 19 pairs on Revolution in that even with the large market moves, it's not really bagging a lot of shitty positions so far...there's some...but if you compare my NN to Evolution...huge difference this week...not making as much, but Evolution is currently about $1400 in the stink and has stopped making at the same pace due to a lot of its dependencies not adding to the profit anymore.

Doubled DD, 1/2'vd profit...not fun!

NN - I will gladly take a lot less profit for a lot less DD!

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Just a side note:  The big DD I have on my lost sock M15 and revolution 1.3 demos are both due to that mass firing of trades problem I'm having.....  A huge amount of trades were fired on GBPNZD at the worst possible time - and they are way under water now.

On a positive note - I've not seen any of that happening with NN so far......

Hey Juraia,

Welcome aboard to testing, dude.

What time frame are you testing?

M1 should have produced some results throughout the day...the only thing that would have stopped it may have been the Time Frame you set it on.

There is already a Default Magic Number in the EA settings. Default = 69. If you want to work with this as a manual tool, change this number to 0 and your off to the races.

I'm not going to be around much over the next couple of days...should be somebody in thread that can help out with questions if you have any additional...

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Overall, at a glance...

The 3 New Traders this week are doing surprisingly well, in spite of the exodus on a number of pairs.

They've either caught a little or sat out...the ones that got caught are managing to hold their own...

Third Trigger seems like it could be improved a touch...more aggressive than a true No Nedge like I was running and less aggressive than the No Nedge Version...

Still another day to play out and so far, the sheepish NN Version of Prophecy is in the lead - being the only one currently above water!

May not say a lot for the first week, especially given the week...but I am sure we will see some other Great Things to Come!

Enjoy the rest of the week, will catch you for the opening of next!

I released it at 08:00 GMT, Magic Number 3, on TF M1, at EURUSD. Not a single deal all day, I wondered because backtest was doing a lot of deals. Then I read your explanation. I put a magical number 0, made a random deal, closed it and changed the number to 3. The expert began to make deals. A little complicated.

What does it mean by saying Trigger 3?

How can I get the other versions?

Just to mention that only with the settings below, test period 08.01.2018 to 28.02.2018, TF M1, account 300 $ withstood the change of trend on 14.02 and ended at 773.90.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Пуснах го в 08:00 GMT, с магически номер 3, на TF M1, на EURUSD. Цял ден нито една сделка, Усъмних се, защото на backtest правеше много сделки. Тогава прочетох вашето обяснение. Сложих магически номер 0, пуснах произволна сделка, затворих я и промених номера на 3. Експерта започна да прави сделки. Малко сложно.

А какво се има в предвид, като казваш Trigger 3?

Как мога да получа другите версии?

Само да спомена, че само с настройките по-долу, тест период 08.01.2018 до 28.02.2018, TF M1, сметка 300 $ издържа на смяната на тренда на 14.02 и завърши на 773.90

Sorry, need to catch up on the thread but life caught on to me so it'll wait till tomorrow.

From what I've seen, the Renko version, 1.3, isn't doing quite well, it's either in big DD (on the mixed account) and in 20$ floating profit on the dedicated Renko account.

Those 20$ are from the early two trades that it hadn't released, they were at -30$ and at +30$ and now are floating around 25$-27$, nothing else traded on the Renko demo.

Yowzers but Rev 1.1 and 1.3 have taken a beating this week.

v1.1 has taken the biggest knock and is floating in some heavy DD. I'm still not interfering manually as I want to see if the EA can bring itself back above water. This heavy DD has also really strained the EA from opening more positions and my account is almost maxed out on trades. Lets hope this baby can swing back!

v1.3 has fared much better. It's also carrying a fairly large DD, but not as bad as v1.1 so its been able to pull more profit this week while holding down the DD.

Interestingly v1.3 on M5 chart is doing really well. It hasn't had nearly as many trades as on M1, but that has also helped in keeping the DD low. +8% for the week with relatively low DD is good for me! lol.

I just closed the EA - Rev 1.3-- and it did very well for the week.

Its an amazing EA

Hey dude,

I like to help and support those who try to help and support development.

If you look at the first post, there's a list of testers with Trade Explorers and their applied ideas...

This helps with development; for those who help, they get an early release of Newer Versions.

Hope you seen a little more today on your trader...don't be afraid to ask questions!

or leave smarmy comments...you know...whatever...

The last dude to shit post here gave me the ambition to work out logic for NN...

Love that guy!

Evolution...

In spite of the market Exodus, some bounces, some just fucking Slaughter Territory for an OBOS filter...still managed to keep pace...

Approx $50/day, gross gains.

As forecasted, by Tuesday of next week - this motherfucker should have doubled.

Definitely hit the fucking skids on DD this week, but...well...it's only a loss when you close the trades, right?

Closing the week, still not hitting the Max Trades in Hold Threshold of 200 - Evolution is only bagging 117 - Magic 7 pairs...still some room to move!

Run little motherfucker...RUN!

That one looks good bro.. which EA you are running on that account?  I have been trying to get some space for testers.. My laptop is kinda dying..

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Truth be known...

That's been my mainstay since September of last year.

Simple...effective...and the logic and Triggering from Evolution, with the increment add.

It's fucking killer, brother!

Different than what is current to Evolution, but if one was careful - much the same as I am selective in running this motherfucker - a good buck can be churned.

Now that I've got the NN idea - I actually think I can make it a little safer....there has been some testy times.

$2k min...

And Money in the bank!

Hi All,

The Raver 1.3 is still plowing on, very slowly, DD (at least in my terms) is a bit of an issue at times, however, with patience and enough funds, it keeps adding to the pile of profits.

Today it has recovered the 50$ loss from last week when I closed some trades manually to keep the DD in check on my live account and we're now at 5$ profit.

On the Mixed account we're at 100$ profit, more or less, with the Renko dragging down the DD like an anchor. However, out of that 90$-ish profit, the Renko contributed around 30$ while the 1M Raver contributed around 60$-ish.

On the Renko only account  there are only two trades running ever since the EA was attached to it, it's at 20++$ floating profit right now, nothing was closed and no new trades, at all.

All in all, I would play with time-based charts to get things going and not count on the Renko (and possible range, as well) charts as a baseline for this nifty EA.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi Magix

How are you?

Hope your live accounts are doing better than my demo...

A little update on my same 8 pairs/lot..news aren't great...

My DD is now in the abyss...from 826$ to 3400$...with 129 opened trade and gain stalling (Technical Margin used 5000$... at .01 lot...Total: 8400$ in use for 262$ net gain...) Ratio: 31/1...With those numbers, l know now l will never go live with évolution or any EA's yet...as long as a long trend could kill them all...So far, there is no exeption...

My post here isn't citicizing just realistic on what chalenges we face trading ea's live...And this is why we all put efforts here... Right...

If l want to try another one...Because l consider my Evolution testing to be over...Same as it may recover one day the dip was too heavy to be realistic lively...It is a waste of time to continue the testing...

Which one to you want we to try now if you still want me on testing...

So let me know...

Have a nice day

Take care

Ben

Hi Ben,

Just my thoughts here.

I've seen people here using higher lots that 0.01 to test these EAs and from what little experience that I've had with channel EAs (no offense, Magix) you can't expect to run higher lots on multiple pairs and expect to have good results with an account that is less than 10K per pair.

There was a thread here, I think it was called london channel EA or something like that, started by Merlin about two years ago, he demonstrated channel trading with his live account but no one knew the size of it, and while people were losing he was able to hold on to most of his trades, now, if this is the guy from MYFXBook that opens up a 10K live account to test grid and chaneel EAs for a single pair, than you can clearly see that some, maybe even most, of those EAs are killing a 10K account with 0.01 lot size on a single or a two to three pairs. So, higher lot size than that would have killed those accounts sooner, much much sooner.

Maybe it's not the same guy, I don't know, but I was following MYFXBook accounts for quite some time and I can tell you that for demo it's great but on a live account you have to have a large account for something to pull off.

Now, maybe the EAs in this thread works better, they certainly works well on my live and demo accounts, maybe the'll double up than burn, I don't know, what I do know is, that testing and trading a channel or a grid trader on a high lot size is not advised.

Just my thoughts here, no offense meant to anyone.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hey Ben,

I am okay with criticism...all good by me, dude.

I am obviously the longest tester, a week longer than any other, for Evolution and still have my Demo running.  In 8 weeks, we are approaching 100% gross gains, but sadly have seen a Draw Down of Close to $2000 on an account that started with $2000...yep...I'd definitely be shitting bricks if this was my cash on the line, but there is some other information to consider with Evolution...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1.  It was the First Adaptation from TDA - with a quicker close in profit trades...ultimately growing the account on the same 7 pairs almost 2x as fast as it's predecessor.

2.  The Profit Factor of Evolution is 2.07, has an annualized return - Pace - of 697.4% per year and boasts an 83.1% win rate...Coming into 8 weeks of testing.

3.  Grid Trading Must afford a little account flex, this is the nature of Grid-Based Trading.

Not sure what pairs you were testing on nor what circumstances you ran into to get that high of a DD on your account...certainly not what I've seen with anybody listed on post 1, using Default Settings.

Moving on...

There are a couple of testers working with Evolution and Revolution on Longer Timeframes, M5, M15...

Check out mrdfx - Revolution 1.3 - M5, 1 week in trading ->HERE
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This actually looks pretty fecking decent...and if you've watched along with him since release, you can see that this has maintained a Fairly Reasonable Draw for the Number of Pairs in tow and for gains it has made...sure...it's holding some basket of Losers, but again, remember that this and it's Early Version, plus the Rev 1.3 still ticks at 83% positive closing.  Will it do the same on an M5, or M15 Timeframe??  Definitely worth investigating...

I've noticed a couple of hiccups from analyzing trades in both Revolution, NN and Prophecy that I am working on correcting.  Until these actually function in market, I can't tell if there are any logistical errors...so, have to correct and watch them run for a while.

Prophecy, HERE, just letting it run its course right now...still haven't had a chance to go back and make changes, but will throughout this week.

Prophecy NN, HERE, actually closed out ALL TRADES today and then...I realized that given its current pairs and the market...it probably wouldn't have traded for the rest of the week...Now, that's fine and all, but not much fun at all!  Plus...there were a couple of issues in the original logic that needed sorting, so, I rewrote it to be a little more aggressive in some aspects and a lot more conservative in others.  Will watch n see how it plays out, only got around to relaunching it after NY Close today.

What you test is completely up to you.  Given the current corrections, I need to make, not going to release anything else right now.

Maybe follow a couple of others in their longer timeframes and pair selection....see if this helps out any.

or...

Go back and analyze some trades...where'd they go right?  Where'd they go wrong??  And drop down an idea or 2...the current version Revolution NN - HERE - has seen $400 worth of Draw, but it is Trading 19 pairs on an M1 chart...the idea for this came from a Shit Poster...

Criticism is good!

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Welp...

Looking good!

As surmised, a little slower growth with the NN logic due to only looking to accumulate the immediate against the long, playing towards a homeostatic median.

Still a few tweaks on this, but if this is the worst I see, max DD - $400 trading 19 pairs gridded, and taking at current pace, looks to double the account every 3 months...that's pretty fecking decent.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hi all!

I had a short look over the lake of my four systems. I can see four heads over the water. One bigger than the other,

but in this Moment - all of them are out. Perfect!!!

Think we should give the TE´s some more time but actually look good.

I am out this week and not here very often - only demo´s - whats shalls. :-)

Have a great week you all !

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hey Magix

How are you?

You are a gentleman...You understood my post was constructive

Regarding the 8 pairs l trade/test...all default settings...

They are: NC, AC,CC,UC, CJ,NU,GC,EC...Why...Because they are in order the cheapest ones on margin cost with my live broker...Important factor when you use any grid EA...

Of course  l know they are highly correlated increasing the effect of trend it self...It is mainly why l am so concern about it...

More l think about... l am afraid that no EA's will finally workout with any correlated pairs together...

So corrolated pairs increase trend effect and possible DD...

Non corrolated pairs increase margin cost with a all grid's EA...

Brokers win both sides...and we are screwed...

Any ideas guys on how defeated brokers on this loaded dice game...with EA's or not...

Have a nice day everybody

Ben

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Things are moving steadily along with all the TE's.

I will note a personal observation between Evo, Rev 1.1, and Rev 1.3. Evolution is still performing really well considering, and IMO its doing better than Rev 1.1, and Rev 1.3. Its holding down the DD better, and churning more pips for only trading half the amount of pairs.

Evolution is only trading 10 pairs, and both Revolution tests are running on 20, but if you look at the DD, and profit between the 3 them, Evolution is the winner winner chicken dinner. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but the changes you made are not making things a whole lot better from my observation. Not criticizing negatively, but that is what is happening with my tests.

Now one test I do want to mention is the Rev 1.3 on M5. This thing is doing really well! Trading on 10 charts it pulling in decent amount of profit, and it's keeping the DD in a healthy range. It opens fewer orders, but is still pulling in those pips! It is still early days so I will keep observing it and see after the first month, if it can maintain these stats then this will have potential on a live account I think.

Well that's my little update for now, I'll keep an eye out, and I look forward to the future developments Magix!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Well Ben, it's like this...

There will ALWAYS be risk, no matter if you are trading Automated or Manually...that's the essence of market.

When you are selling, somebody has to be buying?  Why?

Their Idea of Market is different than yours.

Appreciating that we all have different ideas of market, thresholds for draw and account affordability, it's more of a personal decision than one necessarily need be made by me.

Again...there's this:

Now...you give your money to a bank...it sits in a savings account and in 250 years, you will have made the same thing as we have proven that can be done in 8 weeks.

lol

If you want to reduce DD by correlation, reduce the pairs to a single of the pair core and let them ride.

Or

Change brokers...

Or

Change time frames...

Or

Sit back, check your account once per month and appreciate any gains...

Or

If you find that gridding is not an idea you can sit comfortably with, at least you've learned a little of what is involved and with the benefit of Demo Accounts, hasn't cost you a cent...

No matter where you go from here, you've already won, my friend.

Congrats!

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Great update and analysis, dude.

We have a couple of cases here of where More is Less and Less is More...

Evolution isn't as refined and is a lot more aggressive than Revolution...this is the More is Less part...

One of the concerns with Gridding is that more aggressive in trend can prove to cost average out more effectively and was one of the concerns I had with Revolution as a whole.  If it doesn't take as many positions, will it be as effective?  Had to be tested and I think that there is really nothing wrong with the logic with exception of time it takes to be in market...

Revolution trading on 2x the amount of pairs...this is the More is Less...

Given that the logic has worked well on my Magic 7, doesn't necessarily mean that it will be as effective on all pairs, metals or cryptos.

Each pair has its own independent personality and my Magic 7 seem to play best, as has been mentioned...but that doesn't mean we need to limit the pool to these players...checking them out over a longer course could prove that there are more and maybe even better players that can knock out one or more of my Magic 7.

Evolving the idea from Ev to Rev to NN...these are all ideas implemented to reduce draw on the account, possible allowing folk with more limited risk thresholds to still have a little fun...possibly to allow those with larger accounts to churn a lot faster than on dimes...

So far...NN is my favorite, but with P2NN in test now...it combines all of the best of Evolution, Revolution, No Nedge and even has a faster counter for quick market hits.  Wrote this in wrong, so didn't see it in effect this morning, but should be good from here out.  As it is still playing towards a homeostatic median, it may add some risk, but should still be effective for a couple of percent per month without being a HUGE drain on resources and funds.

Will see how it plays out.

Next idea...to keep the aggression of Evolution is to possibly add in the NN logic to keep it from amassing the draws we have seen on thread versions...might just do this...shits n giggles n all!

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I am intrigued by this thread and of course the magical Magix. I like what Mrdfx has come up with in his analysis of Revolution 1.3. So I have room for a test on this. What I am going to test is 1.3 revolution with default settings on 6 charts. The charts I am going to test will be as uncorrelated as possible to try and keep dd down to a min if one pair goes on a run. I will post a link as soon as I figure out how to do so. I never did that before (yes boys you heard it here and it's actually true this time lol). know ets get this party started and let us help Magix keep it hard as he said in an earlier post lol.

Always interested in having a look at what's under any hood.

Lemme know what you have in mind.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
So...

Been playing around...working on a couple of ideas and the whole Grid Me Out strategy...

I've worked with the Core from the thread, issue being, it will close some partial positions...Not All Positions.

Which pisses me off!

I mean...how many times have you gone for a quick scalp trade, few quick pips and ended up nursing the fucker for a couple of hours?

Worse yet...you leave it unattended and come back to a Horrible Draw Down...

or

You set reasonable Stops, top and bottom...and you come back, your Stoploss has been taken out at the exact market turn and price would now see your position closed in Profit!

FUCK!!

Now, I chatter a lot, in here, emails, dare I say - Twitter...hang out with the family, have a life...always shit to be done, really...

So, the idea of the GridMeOut strategy was to allow this fucker to be as aggressive as me in trading in trend, aggressive in getting me out of shit positions and basically making it so that if I get called away from my terminal, I don't have to keep tapping on my phone while carrying on with my day.

Now...it ain't perfect...if you looked at the code, it ain't pretty...but for me, it's Damned Effective!

Anybody that checks in here, works on a Demo Account for Practice...maybe even have another EA that you have shit positions on that you'd like to see Gridded Out that wants to play around with this new tool?

Word of warning though...It's still in the testing stages, ya prolly shouldn't work with it until you've had a chance to TEST IT OUT on a DEMO ACCOUNT to see what other risks may be involved...

No bells n whistles...but...there is a Minimum Time between trades - ie - if you put it to work on an M1 - like I do, it is default set for 120 seconds (2 minutes) and 2 pips of grid.  The Grid isn't 2 pips, it is a TRIGGER ON GRID strategy making these dynamic - Even more so with the delay - All User Inputs...Change them to whatever you want!

You CAN input your profit, can even change to an incremental or Martingale your order strategy...drop in a Stop Loss - ya know...just in case...

And - Change the Magic Number from 0 - ie - your live trades...to whatever you may already have running.

If/When it finishes gridding out your loser...it will just stop trading.

Anybody interested in helping to develop this motherfucker?

--- 帖子 #659 ---
lol...

Grid me out!

Shitz n Gigglez...random trade on EURUSD - ya know...for testing.

2 closing logics - 1 in trend, 1 out of trend...profit was hit, out of trend logic closed all trades at profit set.

The other trades - still existing - were taken and will still be manged by Revolution NN as per magic number

Whilst fucking around with the Grid Me Out idea...I wrote in a lot more aggressive version of the triggering, which...when the time is right, will actually BREAK the Gridding rules and take trades as the price is moving towards the direction of the trade needed to be gridded.

I dropped in a primary trigger, ran it through the Strat Tester and this is an idea of what it looks like - M1...

The Yellow Circles are trades taken out of Grid Logic, although not a lot in this case...I've seen them get 120 deep to get out of a REALLY Strong Trend...lol...I won't be releasing this version - WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY TO DANGEROUS!

But fun to watch.

I've been looking deeper into the TE's, and seeing what is causing the big DD in both Rev 1.1 and Rev 1.3 tests. I have seen that most of the CHF  and JPY pair are holding the most DD. EURCHF especially is not playing nice at all and is the big culprit, including most of the JPY pairs.

It's a similar story with my other 2 TE's although not as bad. Evolution is still soldiering on nicely, and is still my favorite version so far performance wise.

V1.3 on M5 is also still carrying on churning in pips.

I'm thinking how Evolution would fair unleashed on M5 since its doing better than the Evolution on M1... I'm getting more ideas, now I just need the space on my VPS!

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Looks like EURCHF went on a bit of a run...broke out of it's standard range...this is one of those "Exceptional" charts...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

That being said...it's always darkest before the light...

The JPY pairs...nearing longer range support...if I am correct, any bearish action on these will be severely reprimanded over the up and coming weeks...but this too is just some speculation...

I'm still toggling charts on different timeframes to not just have a tool that will work on a longer timeframe, but will actually make sense to the logic...works in progress...

Much as I've always stated that the market is Fractal...some patterns are similar to those observed in all timeframes, whilst others...not so much.

Meaning?

Applying the same logic from an M1 to an M5 may work out...do this on an M15-H4 and we are in a whole new ballgame. The patterns may still exist, but the ranges may not be as conducive to the same grid range and for that matter, testing and margin requirements...

ie - the 2 things we can never have enough of...time and money!

From the looks of the above chart, the NoNedge version may have played out differently...but unless I drilled down, wouldn't actually be able to 100% confirm.

For the longer TFs - the NoNedge will not work...it's very specific to trend and it's homeostatic identifier...still trying to see the fractals on longer TFs, but looking at this individual case, not sure that I have anything...

Supply and Demand is the foundation of trading. This, I've been able to somewhat able to code in...the current logic is...if we stay in trend and the trend changes, we should be able to grid out. The Homeostatic logic of NN, though may not see as much profit in the overall direction, looks for specific areas to accumulate for later distribution.

It's a pretty complex game, we play...

I've been at this a decade now...traded professional...managed accounts...and I'm still learning.

But...Nobody ever accused me of being that smart.

Magix,

Prophecy no nedge... looks really good.. guess it's still under testing, I suppose.. what's the difference in logic compared to others? what do you think of having a $ amount stop loss option .. ? cut the loss at some point, so by the month end it could be BE or positive, and by the year end we can smile..

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Lots of the trades that you see on the Prophecy No Nedge were from Last week...

There were some parts of the trade logic that I didn't like in Prophecy, so on Monday...while it was flat on trades, I worked on a couple of ideas and corrections and relaunched.

Hasn't been enough range for this to have been fully tested and even for what has, there still remains the idea of having a Counter Trend Trigger in place...just to give this fucker a heartbeat whilst waiting for a Trend Trigger to come.

Here's an idea of the Counter Trigger...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

All trades in Green - Cycled Trend Trades.

The one in Red - that's where the counter trigger kicked in.

I wanna see how this works after this week, it might be something that HAS to GO to just keep the even keel...NFP Week - This is the week where all grid traders look magical...I don't want this to be my False Positive.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Prophecy - as was originally written...leaves a little to be desired.

I'd call this the shortness of my ability to code over the actual logic...but, whatever...it's still churning!

This is only 7 pairs in trade, whereas Revolution NN has 19...less Draw and well...due to 19 pairs, more profit!

--- 帖子 #682 ---
BUT!

An interesting Note about the Newly written code for Prophecy NN...

The Gridding logic from it is fundamentally what is being used for the Grid Me Out EA.

I've played with 3 versions...it still requires a little polishing...but this should give the average user the ability to keep profitable while maybe not being that great at trading.

We're changing the playing field!!

Even More interesting...

And maybe a little more Exciting too...maybe just for me!

So Magix correct me if I'm wrong as I'm trying to keep up with all the new things, new ideas, and tests going on lol.

Evolution -> Revolution v1.1 -> Revolution v1.3 -> Revolution NN -> Prophesy -> Prophesy NN -> GMO -> ......

Is that correct?

Feeling your pain, dude...all this is going on inside of my head!

lol

You are correct...those are the Evolutionary Steps of Evolution...unless we count TDA ->Previous release as Genesis...if not...it goes back to Allin->like 5 or 6 years ago.

lol

Just some 3000+ steps in between.

This is RaverN on 5 pairs (on my TE), demo.

Tao days of trading, DD was......-10$, at best.

Jeez, M. what the hell?! Where's my DD?! I demand you bring my DD back!!!!!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Raver1.3 on mixed demo and on my live account are doing rather well, DD is huge in comparison, I've seen it go as much as 80$ on only one pair.

But still, profit is profit, you just need to have enough breathing balance to get it.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
There is, in theory, a bit of Logic Issue that I do need to work out in the NN Strategy that may help further reduce the DD...we've only seen a couple of weeks in action, but at the same time, this little flaw could see it sell into support and buy into resistance.

May not be as bad as Evolution for tops n bottoms, but until we see a true range with a little more flight under its wings, we won't know for sure.

Fix for the logic...

Dunno...

As it is still theoretical and hasn't really happened yet, going to be hard to fully wrap my head around.

Other side of the coin...this could be what makes it a little more profitable overall...

--- 帖子 #691 ---
My testing with rev 1.3 is going - I think very well -- I am running this unattended -- and with EU only- I know that 0.1 lot is pushing it with a 2k starting capital but I like to see what this can do in the worst case stress test.

The EA dug a pretty good hole for itself with the first few days of the week and it recovered all on its own -- I was not sure it would make it, but it did.

Tomorrow will be very interesting to see how it plays out for NFP.

Magix - I will be running the EA unattended for the next 3-4 weeks for I will be out of town for that time period -- but I will leave it running and if anything screws it up --well that's the way it is.....  If you have any suggestions -- just let me know.    regards

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Your Scaling is correct...

With a recommended starting of $200 per trade pair at a .01 lot size...$2k for .1 is about where ya need to be.

That being said...I still prefer a cushion on the account and by working with multiple pairs and a bit more padding, it does stand a better chance of success.

Working with multiple pairs typically ensures that as one is holding a Draw Down...the other is trading for profit.

Using Evolution as an example...if we were just on EURAUD...it would have stopped trading and possibly margined out as a sole trader. Given the other pairs performing, it keeps on a regular path of $50/gains per trading day.

Revolution is a little different in logic for triggering, but again, with such short testing periods, it's hard for me to know which is the better strategy - Ev or Rev...

As this is just a Test Account...fuck it!

Let er run!

Pass or fail, we will have a better understanding in a month from now, right?

Safe Journey, brother!

One will close like the Evolution Core - Whittling away best to worst...Tiny Bites.

The other will demand all trades closed - The Whole Enchilada.

The only thing...you have to take - at very least - the FIRST TRADE...

Or

Take as many as you want...

After that, the logic will kick in and close on the first opportunity in/out of trend - 2 different logics - to get you the Minimum Profit Set.

Taking a few lessons from what we've learned with Evolution and Revolution and rewriting this one too...

TMA + CG is good, but I think I can make this a little more conservative while still being profitable.

Hi All!

today I had some free time to have a look at the different Systems I run in demo. All started at the same time at 27.02.2018.

I will post closed and open trades of the three versions to give you a short overview.

All accounts started with the same pairs and there was no manual interference. Two times I had to reboot the Server during the

test but this should not have a big influence on the results.

Revolution 1.1 looks like this:

Oldest open trade is two days old

Beside These accounts I have one older account of Version 1.1, started 19.02.2018, with some more data collected

Here are the numbers
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

16 Trades open since february

After looking at all these numbers and the different TE´s linked to this thread I think about starting a live account.

For the moment I would choose NN, because of the lower DD, starting with the "best" pairs out of the different tests.

What do you think?

Ahhh, regarding DD. Maybe someone can help. The numbers I see on myfxbook about DD seem to be not very accurate.

Is there any Indi or tool to have a clear Information about the highest DD in the accounts, % or better currency?

Happy Weekend for all

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi Magix,

Great job you are doing here. The evolution of the EAs seems to be fast and furious.

I have space on my VPS to join the testing. I will like to join the NN or Prophesy or GMO tests.

Do let me know which one you prefer.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Wouldn't use the last 2 weeks as determining weeks...these are weeks designed for Grid Traders...

Just saying...

--- 帖子 #707 ---
YES!!! You are right, I think.

But maybe you know this feeling ...... demo is demo - REAL is REAL.

The numbers tell me, that some success is possible. And like always - No risk - No fun.

With the rule of 200 per pair and some wellknown and goodtested pairs ..... it could work.

Another question: The old positions .... could it be possible to "Grid Them Out"?

Maybe an idea to deal with the GMO-Project. DOn´t know how Revolution reacts when GMO

junps in ist business.... could These motherf... be friends? .... or colleagues ? ....

--- 帖子 #708 ---
I am not telling you not too...

What I was suggesting is that decisions on these shouldn't be made by 2 weeks of performance, especially this current period.

If you do take into consideration the equity curve and Draw against equity from the Evolution Testers, this conceivably could be a better depiction...

Demo is Demo and Real is Real...seeing that these have taken accounts hundreds into the shit on Demo...we don't sweat it...seeing that in your own account, may be a different story.

I do have a lot of confidence in these adaptations, but also have a lot of history with them, live and demo and just want to lend a little caution to you.

As for the GMO's...they will trade remarkably similar to the current logic being employed with exception to the fact that they are a lot less refined - by way of filtering.  I am going to really need be cautious with these as no matter how good the tool, in the hands of the uneducated, it may be disastrous.

If a user thinks that they can try and salvage multiple positions with $100 Drawdown on a $150 account with a GMO...probably going to end in some serious butthurt.  If somebody is cautious...different story.  Timeframe.  Grid.  Delay.  Type of add...all factors that will be important to the success.

And...as mentioned here:

There's no market perfection...just ways to help improve your odds of success.

I'm pulling for ya, dude...

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Hey everyone, just posting my results for this week so far. I am going with 6 pairs that are uncorrelated using Revolution 1.3.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
What sort of DD figures are you getting?

I ask this as Myfxbook is generally pretty accurate with their calculations.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Hey Magix,

If I want to start a new 5000 $ demo account with Revolution NN in 1 Min chart, you recommend to use also 0,01 lot ? 200 $ per pair minimum ? so if I use 20 paires, I need at minimum 4000 $ ?

Maybe it will be better if we use non correlated paire, like suggest someone before. What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #712 ---
It's easier to collect data from an account that isn't blowed up...so the rule of $200/pair with a Minimum $2k start is most likely to ensure that we will see as long of history as possible.  All Data is Good Data.

Working with ideas like non-correlated pairs is a Great Idea...minimizes the pairs as well as may give a better chance of success.

Look at Angelica's post.

That was exactly her strategy.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Awesomeness!

Best DD since week 2.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Just another thing Magix,

I have "Order send error 4051" and "error open sell N 4051" when I backtest the Revolution N N

--- 帖子 #715 ---
There's your issue...you were running a Backtest.

lol - j/k

I just went through my log reports on Rev NN - don't see anything like that.

ERR_INVALID_FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE  4051  Invalid function parameter value.

2 Guesses on the error.

1.  Not enough Margin to take a trade.

2.  EA has already taken the max amount of positions.

I am assuming that it was trading and then stopped, right?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
No, he continue to make the backtest, even with this error... it's strange

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Ya got me, dude...

Check your log reports, see if you can see this error in live trading and post it here...might be a clue in there.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
My Revolution NN is so sweet!  You get used to the tails always hanging down.....  not so with this one - floating profit for the last couple days now.  Such a pretty picture!  Looking like it could run on considerably less capital or at least with more pairs.  Awesome!!

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Well Revolution 1.1 is officially capped out, it's reached the limit of 200 pairs on the account.

One thing to note is that the DD has dropped a bit at least, but now it will be interesting to see how the EA recovers itself from this position. With it now being capped out it will be unable to open more positions to cost average itself on some of the pairs.

We can only watch and wait.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Looking good, dude...

NN, a lot more conservative to get into a trade...not as much when the trend changes...that's the biggest difference between Evolution and Revolution.

Good thing so far that we've seen a Massive Spike down last week and a correction this...otherwise, could be a very different story.

I know I may be a little over cautious in some regards...when I drop these into my accounts, I know the risks and am only trading with money I can afford to lose...don't want to see anybody get a hold of these because of the last 2 weeks thinking that this will be how it always is...it very well could be...one week in the shit, next week in the green, but it's waaaaaaaaaaay to early to tell this story.

Evolution, given it's somewhat conservative nature and even with a bit of a shit trigger on the backside is more capable of handling large movements...Revolution, I can only speculate.

Next couple weeks should be interesting.

Will public release NN and see if we can get a couple more testers on board for statistical analysis and then sit back n watch.

Only taken a few trades today myself...still testing the GMO...hopefully be able to get that done for next week as well.

I've got the granddaughter all weekend, including today...helping to explain my spotty replies and lack of progress on the coding stuffs.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Where it's at - moneywise - if this was live, you could either risk waiting for even and close all - reboot!

or, just cut losses and reboot anyways...

This was the issue I figured we'd eventually see with this many pairs on Revolution...of course, I really only thought about it after I'd already launched an account with it...

Even looking at my Rev NN account...if this was live cash, I'd drop the trades and walk away into the weekend holding nothing but $446 profit from 2 weeks of watching blinkey lights and moving dots.

This is almost the exact same pace of Evolution without the Massive DD...approx $50/trading day.

Hope this keeps up!

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I have the error on forward too... on 2 différents brokers. Error Open buy or sell N 4051 and Invalid lots amount for Ordersend function.

I have trade on the account, and it's profitable, but this kind of error a present, do you know why ?

--- 帖子 #723 ---
What pair?

Can you zip the log files and attach to a reply?

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I  have open the log file and the error don't appear in it. I have make a screenshot.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
My bad, I have look in the wrong file, I attach to this reply

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Yeah in a way I'm not too surprised though, grid trading with 20 pairs, and a 200 pair limit, is only 10 trades per pair, and it took 19 days to reach the limit, so actually not too bad lol.

In a live environment I would never run the EA on 20 pairs, but for testing purposes it's fine to get a good look, and do analysis.

Evolution will complete 30 days next week, and Rev 1.1 as well, so then I'll have some free space for some new tests.

Post 1 updated.

Added "Ev and Rev".

Evolution 1.1 added - Requires TMA+CG mladen indicator.

Revolution N - No Nedge Version of Revolution.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Yes...I've made some Modifications to the Evolution Code...even though we have seen some great success with the Revolution and No Nedge Logic, I still think that Evolution will always have a place in market.

The Draw Down on Evolution, at times, has exceeded anything that anybody would call reasonable. To this, there is no question!

But at the same time..given it's success in spite of the Draws and Equity Curve overall...while still maintaining an over 80% positive closing average, doubling an account balance in under 60 days - is still pretty fucking impressive.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Inside of the primary triggering of the original version, one of its dependencies was the TMA+CG indicator...used in 2 separate ways.

1. Overbought and Oversold - as applied to daily movements.

2. For immediate triggering - while separate trend definitions are present.

On the Backside Triggering - When the trend is against current trades - TMA+CG was also being employed...but very poorly!

This is Absolutely no fault of mladen nor the indicator, 100% on me...more laziness than anything.

There's only so much of an idea you can gain from watching backtests run...for me ZERO is in the equity curve...100% is in watching the logic.

I can only do this for so long and until you see hundreds of days of data on several pairs, you can never gain a full comprehension of all of the possibilities. Take this and the fact that the Data from Strat Testers and Market Conditions fluctuates...even if I was to watch hundreds of hours of this fucking dribble on historical charts, it still wouldn't necessarily be accurate...

However!!

Having run Evolution for almost 2 months now, I was able to catch some obvious issues in the logic...and have now corrected this...pretty sure I got it all correct...but will know more as we progress.

The ideas implemented should Delay the Primary Trigger to what I would consider better chances of making targets and the BackSide triggering is a lot more conservative.

Both of these may reduce profitability...but in the long run, they should also decrease the Draw Down and Risk.

I will be adding a New TE for Evolution 1.1 for the new week while still keeping my original running.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Revolution N1 or No Nedge.

Fairly impressed with this motherfucker after only a couple of short weeks in trade.

Testing 19 pairs, on a $3k account, with a minimum 2 pip grid, is flat out insane!

As most brokers have a Maximum Trade Allowance of 200 trades, this only allows around 10 trades per active pair...on a 2 pip minimum grid...this could easily be hit in mere hours...not weeks...and yet...here we are!

Revolution - More conservative than Evolution, in primary and secondary triggering, allows it to possibly keep more pairs in trade.

The No-Nedge portion is what HAS kept these trades as low, while still being as effective and profitable.

2 weeks, closing over 1000 trades, over 80% positive closing, while closing out over $400 in profit - AWESOME!

Fact is, it could have done this on a lot less equity and if one was selective in their pairs, could be even more...

There's not been a lot of history for Revolution NN yet...so as of now, it remains a GREAT START, but still more data needed.  It took me almost 2 months to realize the issues with Evolution, could be the same for Revolution NN as well...

Fingers Crossed this kind of action continues...

Awesome news Magix! Next week when my Evolution 1.0 test concludes I'll start up a new test with Evolution 1.1, this should be fun, as Evolution is and has been my favorite version so far in my tests.

With the 4 versions up and running, Evolution, Revolution, Prophecy, and now also GMO, are the Rev and Evo versions the ones you're focusing more on now?

I mean from all these versions each with their own unique differences, what will your main focus be on?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Truth be told, if it wasn't for your conviction and comments on Evolution, I would have probably just moved from it...

Thanks for the support, dude!

Also going to put some finishing touches on Evolution NN for next week as well...will launch a TE and verify triggering before I shoot it out to my distro.

Earlier trend shift detection...may give better profiting with reduced Draws...

Maybe?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Might have a Buffer Zone sorted for the No Nedge!!

Exciting Times!

w00t!

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Not to post a Strat Test report...because that'd be kinda cunty since the only thread rule is to "Not post Backtest Reports"...

So...

I'm not going to do that...but I will say that the Evolution NN is looking very good.

Watching the triggering logic on the charts makes sense...this could conceivably produce almost Evolution Gains without Evolution Draw.

Still pondering the 3rd Entry for Grid Spacing...will maybe wait to see how shit works out and go from there!

I have taken down 2x Trade Explorers - both of the Prophecy traders to add in the New Evolution 1.1 and Evolution NN.

Trading on the Magic 7 pairs.

I think Evolution 1.1 has the potential to earn a little faster than the NN, but NN has the potential to keep Draws lower...

Will see how these stack up against Revolution NN and the original Evolution!

Let the GAMES BEGIN!

--- 帖子 #758 ---
After reviewing a little data on both Evolution and Revolution, there seems to trade cycle connection.

The Dark before the Light and inverse, seem to come in 5 day cycles.

Looking at market tendency and really now the No Nedge - Homeostatic - Targeting works, it seems to, by no intent of coding, bring darkness to light in that 5 day period.

These 5 days, do not necessarily coincide with the Monday to Friday times table...seem to be as random as market, really...

Just thought it interesting to point out.

Ya know...in case one was to launch these live and want to preserve gains or reduce risk...from Darkest to Brightest - 5 days...cash in your chips...rinse and repeat!

Darkest to light does NOT necessarily mean that All Trades will be closed out, but that the amount of gain on these will exceed the Draw in that period.

EURAUD and AUDUSD seemed to be exceptions to these rules given their current trends...but when locked in with the others of my Magic 7...account cash periods seemed to still be the 5 day cycle.

So...

Really...

Fuckem!

Right?

I mean, there's nothing saying you HAVE to wait until all trades are closed to pull profit...

Welp...coming into the close of Day 1 for Evolution 1.1, looking like the same patterned equity curve as it's predecessor and a couple bucks short of the Daily Average for Evolution - $44 for New, approx $47 for the original...but it could just be the day...

Bit of a whipsaw kind of day, but some really good trade sets and still closing above the 80% winning...trading both directions, pretty fecking good...

I seen a lot more single sets on this than is standard for Evolution, meaning one trade in the set closing in profit, this I would say can be attributed to removing the TMA+CG as a triggering point and forcing a little more delay in trades to give a better chance of success.

Overall...pretty happy with Day 1...

What the fuck kind of day did EURUSD have today...

Unfortunately, in the whipsaws of Bull to Bear to Bull again, we kind of got caught bagging a couple shorts...

Orange Boxes..neutral trend zones, additional cost averaging not present.

Box 1 - No More longs added, out of trend.

Box 2 - No more shorts added, out of trend.

I can appreciate the issues on EU today...Got trapped on some of this shit manually as well.

Nice trading on EURJPY this evening...

If you look at the total profit minus commissions, works out to be $2.44...(approx 23 pips)

If you look at the entire range of play for EURJPY, it's 20 pips...

Covered that, paid commissions, without nailing exact tops n bottoms.

Very Kewl!

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Read an interesting post by brother digs covering the range of trade on EURUSD for the entire year...working out to be, from top to bottom about 8 pips per day.

Crazy, right??

So...let's see how Evolution Stacks up on EURUSD...

From Start Date - January 15th to Current, top to bottom is almost exactly 400 pips.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

400 pips, works out to be about $40 at a dime per pip...

Now...we've seemingly played bottom to top, back to bottom back to top a couple of times and then to a midway...so, that'd be more like 1600 pips - $160.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

EURUSD - on Evolution for this time...according to the trade report...3499 pips - $325.

Now...that's more than 2x the traded area...that's impressive!

Kinda adds a different perspective to things, hey?

Wow how time flies! The 1 month test of Evolution has come to an end!

I must say this was a fun test, and the first of many tests of Magix's creations.

I did mention before that Evolution was my favorite test till now and had been doing really well throughout the month handling the DD in a pretty good way. Overall final results are also really good, and I'm impressed with what this first version was able to do.

Final stats: All time profit, 91%, on only 6 pairs! Wowzers that is impressive! On only 6 pairs this thing went on to make nearly $1k in a month, and that's with 0 intervention!

I am more than happy with the results, yes there is a bit of DD at the end, but if this test had run longer I'm sure it would have managed it.

I'm going to load up Revolution v1.1 on the same pairs and see how it compares, or maybe add a few more and see, but if this is what v1.0 was able to accomplish then v1.1 should be awesome. Thanks again Magix!

Guys... here is my opinion with the differents version of Ev and Rev etc.. It's just my point of vue and it's not a critic, Magix have done a really good job.

So, you need to do a minimum of backtest if you want to have a realistic vue of what this EA can do it. On several pairs, you can see there is 2500 to 3000 $ of drawdown, and it's just in the year of 2017 ! I don't talk about 2010... or 2008 etc...

You need to know what is the worst case scenario and be prepared to it. If the logic don't change, (no SL, same % of win rate etc..) we can do only one thing... having 2000 $ PER pair and so, having 20 000 $ for using 10 pairs is the minimum for a long term view.

2018 have not a real movement like 2016 or 2017 and this is why it's starting very good for Ev or Rev. But if your goal is to win money with this EA, you can't just put 3000 $ and prey for not blowing up your account...you can do this in demo of course.

Why I talking about backtest ? because I have seen the logic and seen the movement, and it's match with the forward test, so let's assume than for now, we are in the same situation of volatility like in 2017, we would have the same drawdown... and with different pairs this is a 70 or 80% drawdown..

Again, this is just my opinion and Magix have done a great work. You just need to be realistic if you test it for making money and beeing safe as possible.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
I couldn't agree with you more.

Not based on backtests...

But caution is always a good thing.

Hey Magix

Am running the EV 1.1a on the real account  5k  with 20 pairs ( 0.25 ) per lot lool

is it crazy or extreme crazy  ( in matter of risk )

And i made the magic number 0 for all ( dont know if its going to trade diff than the default )

till now it is working amazing

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Looks Awesome, dude!

Setting the Magic Number to 0 only means that if you take a trade, the EA will cost average for you, if price is against you, or will close your position when the closing criteria are met. Besides that...all the same.

We still don't have a lot of history on 1.1a, yet...

I think all coding is correct, but I haven't seen full action as of yet...

That being said, looks like you know how to manage your account.

Keep on, keeping on!

\m/

Oh...and can I borrow $20?

lol

--- 帖子 #807 ---
lol... ok this the exact opposite of what I have say...I wish you good luck Abusaad. And make withdrawl if you want to keep your money.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Magix,

step order = 1 means it should open only one trade, right? Evolution 1.1a opens multiple positions with this setting.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Step order = minimum space between trades.

Default = 20 -> 2 pip minimum grid spacing.

There is no Max number of trades on these...not sure, with their current logic, that I'd want one...

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Magix in the case of leaving the default magic number to 69, or changing it to 0, which would be the better option?

Wouldn't it be better for the EA to cost average positions out to minimize losses so have it set to 0?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thank You..! I got it wrong..

--- 帖子 #812 ---
If/When you use this and take manual trades, setting the Default Value to 0 will allow the logic to kick in and try and close this position in profit.

All Manual Trades have a Default Value of 0.

If there are already trades taken under a different magic number and you change the magic number, the EA stops looking at them...they become invisible...BUT...

Under a different magic number, the EA will continue to look for a trigger to take under the New Magic Number, completely forgetting that it took a trade under a different magic number.

If you only use this as was posted...there's no need to change the magic number.

If you want to fuck around and try this out with some manual trading...set the magic number to 0 and giver!

Does this make sense?

Evolution 1.1a is insane!!. Just taking the pips little by little and no loss yet. Like they say, little drops of water make the ocean. Thanks for this EA Magix! I set it up with ten pairs! call me crazy. LOL. What I did was to change the magic number for all of them before activating live trading and it works just fine. Picking trades for all the pairs. I see the account growing steadily. Just curious, what are those stretched out blue dotted lines. The Magic of Magix is an excellent invention.

The chop continued...all pairs, throughout the day...

Glad I sat this shit out!

I'm on day 3 of a water fast...decided to do one ahead of April because I haven't been altogether good on my diet and decided to be a little more reactive for this month than proactive for the next...

Felt like total shit all fucking day...still do.

Fucking Detox Effect of this...by tomorrow, should be all good.
fingers crossed.

In spite of the whipsaw...Evolution 1.1a managed to keep pace, for the most part...taking small bites out of market where available and ended up accumulating a few more positions than we would see in a standard day...few more trades too...with a lot less profit.

This is due to the trend nature of Evolution...when trend flips, it looks for the quickest escape at profit instead of trying to take more meat off the bone.

All in all...Pretty fecking happy with how it made out...

$27 in the shitter, 26 total positions...and given the conservative nature of this beast, the size of the account and the fact that I have limited this test to my Magic 7...feel pretty confident that it will continue to excel, even at a better clip than it's predecessor.

Rock into close, you motherfucker!

Go Ev Go!

Bish, how are you going about the rinse and repeat process? Do you manually close trades at the end of the week? Or do you use another way?

I guess...also very notable...

From $2k in the stick a couple of short weeks back to less than $100 for the original Evolution.

Going over the trades...there's currently 54 in hold...nothing older than March 12th.

It just keeps getting better!

--- 帖子 #823 ---
A little more stats on Evolution...

After 60 days in...

Profit Factor - 2...

Closed close to 5000 trades...

And still won 83% of those!!

Sure...we can lend some of this to market chop over the last 2 months...but if we did that, we'd also have to assume that it was just pure luck that it launched on the day it did...and had 60 perfect trading days following...

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Magix I have a question. The default setting is 0.01, with a minimum profit close of $1.

Suppose I wanted to increase the lot size then I would also increase the minimum profit close as well so that I could increase the profit per trade correct?

Say for example I wanted to use 0.02 lots not 0.01, in that case I would increase the minimum profit close from $1 to $2 so then I would basically make 2X the default setting, am I correct?

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Actually...

That's a really good point...

The answer is yes...

But now that I've doubled the Original Evolution...account size is 100% greater than start...it would seem logical steps to double the lots and profits and see if it would double it again in 60 days...

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Magix... when I backtest on the good period of time, I have alsos 80/85 % of wining rate. So it's depend in what type of volatility period you start your backtest///forwar test etc...

So for the moment, it's luck yes, because we don't have big volatility and trust me my frend... in this context, the big volatility will come for sure. Maybe in few month, but if you win 3 / 4 or even 7 month in a row, for losing the entire account in the 8 month, it's not very cool. And the past has already shown us that several types of movements can completely destroy the account.

If you test in real money, make many withdrawl !

--- 帖子 #827 ---
To a certain extent...it's true, there was a little luck involved...

In the same way, I won't personally trade after December 15th and before the end of the 3rd week of January of the New Year...I did pick this time to launch the EA.

Part of this was due to the Close All Logic of TDA Hitting Stoploss on trades, by not having the logic to close out partial lots like the Evolution series does.

TDA...ran for 6 months.

Only stopped out, because there was a Stop Loss Value...

It's true, that we have no idea where the market is going...and really, all we can do is chip away directionally.

The Evolution 1.1a - I think this stands the best chance of all previous releases and not so much by the NN standards as will by profitability.

Make more, Draw has less of an impact on the overall account.

By spreading this out to multiple pairs that play by the rules...ie - Magic 7 - the absolute likelyhood of it being in jeopardy on all pairs at the same time is, I believe, greatly reduced.

Really, time will be the teller...

And...

For shitz n gigglez...

I did take mrdfx idea to double down with the original Evolution.

This will fuck with it some, forcing it to wait for larger closes on the original lot size...but should still be interesting.

Magix, the answer is: non-sober, ignorant or just plain dumb......in saying that I'm cutting down on my own consumption for months so maybe I am not the right person to answer that question.

Anyway mate, initial thoughts on NN are that the EA is a diesel engine......chugs along slowly but very steady, DD is low etc, but of course you already know that.

It is very tempting to wack that thing on a live account with a conservative number of pairs.

Anyone else thinking about going live?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
The values for profit are the same as the values for cost averaging...Dynamic.

In order for there to be a trigger enter or trigger exit, there is criteria that need be met.

If a single trade in place, one and only one on the pair, and it gets a trigger exit, it will exit...this value is typically just above 50% of the minimum profit close.

If more than a single trade are in place, the minimum value is the sum of the greatest and worst trade in, with a trigger.

There are 2 triggers in place for exit on the Evs and Revs...in trend and out of trend...and by out of trend, it's more specific to weakness of trend.

Unfortunately, due to circumstances, I did need to break my fast after 3 days...would have preferred to go for at least 5 days this round...there's always next time.

I did get back ketosis, really, this is a fast track protocol...so...even though I stopped short, mission accomplished.

Is it just me or are the TE taking a beating today?

Rev v1.1 the DD is now more than dbl the profit, and now almost as high as half of the initial deposit. I also think that the 200 trade limit is hampering with the logic of the EA, with not being able to open more positions.

Rev v1.3 is not as bad, but the DD has increased by around $500 today.

Rev v1.3 on M5 has also increased DD by around $250 today.

Evolution v1.1 is doing far better then the others but its DD has also gone up $100 today.

Today is def not a good day for the EA's. Lets hope they can bounce back!

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Accumulation for Redistribution and Profiting...

This is where the logic truly gets tested!

I have seen trade explorers where individuals have more than 200 trades, meaning, some brokers don't have this threshold.

In this, we have 2 choices.

Limit pairs to the accounts to maintain under 200...

or

Find a broker that allows more than 200 trades.

These ideas will ultimately come to the individual user and their pain threshold as applied to Draw Downs...

If you are holding 200+ trades and are deep in the shit...will adding more draw to this allow you to sleep at night?

Real money on the table, of course...

For my Test accounts, I've changed shit up a bit.

On the Evolution account, my original that has doubled...I did increase the lot size to .02...but then...decided to drop in Evolution 1.1a instead and still keep the lot size at .02.  Really...it is the better logic of the pair of these so, might well test it.

On my Evolution 1.1a account, I set it to Sumlot start...adding in incrementally.

I know the DD will increase, along with profiting...but also need to see where this logic will fail...gives me something to look at, while not working on anything else.

The settings of Evolution 1.1a and Revolution 1.3 are not exactly the same because of the tests. What I see so far is a big difference in favor of Revolution 1.3. If I set the Revolution 1.3 settings in Evolution 1.1a, what will it get for me? What do you think Magix? Give advice.

Все още е рано да кажа какво животно си създал, но засега е приятел на човека. Знам, че не ти харесва backtest, но преди да стартирам на живо тази седмица, буквално не спях предишните събота и неделя, за да започна с настройките, които вече показах. Не са еднакви настройките на Evolution 1.1a и на Revolution 1.3, точно заради тестовете. Това, което виждам до момента е голяма разлика в полза на Revolution 1.3. Ако сложа настройките на Revolution 1.3 в Evolution 1.1a, какво ли ще се получи на живо? Какво мислиш Magix? Дай съвет.

С резултат и няма отворени сделки в момента.

Evolution 1.1а се измъкна от DD -18$ и сега няма отворени сделки. Печалбата до момента е почти двойно по-малка от Revolution 1.3.

The DD so far 26 pairs

The Sum Start lot will provide an increase in profiting...but may also increase the risk.

Default settings for the grid is 2 pips or 20, you have it set to 15 or 1.5 pips...not a lot of difference...but on Evolution 1.1a, it may get you out of more trend reversals...should...

I've only started testing the sum start lot overnight...it's doing its thing...can't really comment on it yet.

The fixed start will allow a lot less DD, but may also keep you in larger drawdowns for longer periods...but if you are in no rush, may be the safest way to go.

I've spent some time watching both of these, but still more tend towards Evolution - 1.1a...using this same code, I have a personal scalping tool that cost averages out my trades very well...Revolution...a little slower, so not as fond.

Both of these are, in my opinion, excellent tools...it's really how you find them working for you and your specific needs that gives them value.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
w0wsers!

26 pairs on a $700 account is more than a little risky...

26 pairs, from what we've seen, unless you have a broker with higher than 200 trade max, is a lot risky.

Cost averaging out, leaves less than 10 trades per pair...

Once positions are filled, you're kinda fucked!

But...ya know...if you're just playing around, getting some stats on these...might well giver!

Both of these are still moving fairly strong In-Trend...it's only when the EA starts to detect weakness that it will work to playing towards its pivotal point.

Use the others who have posted Test Accounts on Post 1 for reference.

It does help if you've started at or around the same time...but even late to the game, these should still give a little perspective of what is in trend and where the choppy market is.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Rev 1.3 has a bit of an issue with stronger trends...wasn't a true-ish counter trigger as much as a continuation of trend...

Still needs some time.

If we fail in trend....and fail...can we then flip to an M15?

Don't get me wrong...I am actually quite happy with the results of this week.

Sure, there is some draws...but look at them...closely.

Expectation is a part of these ideas...we know there will be market flex and rogues...goes without question.

The NN's handle this very well...only issues being, we don't have enough history on these motherfuckers to be conclusive!

All in all...

Great Fucking WEEK!

Market Flex...Market Profit.

Let me start the bidding...

TRUE STORY!

Was at a business meeting, out of town, overnight kinda thing.

Ate and drank...way too much!

After the following day, meetings with breakfast and lunch...it was a short 90 minute drive home, was feeling - okay...

Got almost half way home and my belly decided, it was time to poop!

Well...FUCK!

No place to stop...let's eek it out!!

Nope!

Belly and sphincter were not in agreement on that!

Had to stop at a roadside rest area to unload my shorts!

Had to flush them motherfuckers...they might have plugged the terlet!

Awkward drive the rest of the way home...only to find a houseful of company when I got there!

Pleasantly excused myself to shower and burned my trousers the next day!

Everybody knows...nobody talks about it...

Ya wanna know why??

I'm not alone!

Magix , great system for sure.. Missing Piece?? Ive been messing with all kinda systems in forex and stock market for years .. sometime you find a system that works great etc then all of a sudden it stops working . I swear that sometimes it comes down to day of the week. Its almost like the algos running the markets change on certain days so everyone else could never catch them.  I noticed eveolution 1.1 worked well on wed evening and thurs,  Fri not so much.  Would be interesting to see which one of your EAs do better on certain days of the week... just curious? Could be the minor tweak your looking for

Have a similar story, but I was running a marathon....I prepared pre race by knowing on the map where each toilet was on the course, and also pooping before the race.

With 11 kms to go, I couldn't hang on any longer, all the toilets that wete on the map were no were to be seen on the course.

At that point I was so happy to see bushes and no expectators......those big soft leaves from the beautiful Canberra trees defenitely did the trick

hahahahaha.......

was an interstate journey. 12 passengers and suddenly my tommy went into overdrive  halfway into the journey. Initially, I thought I could hold on to the end of the trip. Wow...the shit couldn't just wait longer. I was covered in hot sweat. was practically running feverish temperature at this point. I was squirming calling on the driver to just park anywhere and free me from this punishment. I felt I was going to even shit through my mouth. Awful experience I tell you. LOL. eventually, he stopped. I jumped into the bush with no care of my safety. All I wanted was to be relieved. I came out of the bushes after a few minutes relieved and smiling. Just happy I didn't have to do it in my pants.

I downsized it down to only 6 pairs now that you've mention it, me just tryna to get that fine point of margin and DD probably gonna introduce more pairs later on or possibly uncorrelated all pairs leave none matching maybe it'll be better...

So I've been giving some deeper thoughts into which currency pairs are better suited to this strategy, and logic of the EA, and I was looking into which pairs are best suited to have a more "balanced basket" of sorts, having some correlated, and uncorrelated pairs being traded. I was reading up in more detail about currency correlation, and looking at the various TE's using the EA's, and their pairs being traded.

My reason behind this is I think that having a balanced list of pairs will give a more balanced rounded result, and help minimize DD while still making profit. Now I know that currencies move in cycles, and what was trending this week could consolidate or reverse the following week. Currencies can also be affected fundamentally causing them to move in unexpected ranges etc.

I do think that having a list of pairs too closely correlated could work in your favor, and also against you so maybe you might have good profits for a few weeks, but then it can turn on you, and you'll see red across all pairs cos of their close correlation.

So... I was playing with the pairs, and seeing what pairs would possibly work better together, to find the most "balanced" list. My idea is that whichever way the market is moving there will more than likely be some pairs doing well, and some others not so much, but together they would balance the account in profits and DD.

In my analysis I've excluded NZD and CHF pairs as in all of my trading nothing good, and profitable has ever come from trading those 2 pairs. I then listed the remaining 6 currency pairs, and worked on building a balanced correlated, and uncorrelated as best as I think I could. The result is 8 currency pairs all fairly equally balanced I think... AUDJPY AUDUSD EURCAD EURGBP EURJPY GBPUSD USDCAD USDJPY

So in my next test I will run a new TE with these pairs, and see how it handles, and compares to my current 10 pairs test.

What do you guys think of the list? Do you agree in the selection, have some suggestions?

Been thinking about the Cross Co ideas again, as posted HERE .

But after some thought...I'm looking at it from another angle.

Because of the short ranges and fast frames that we are trading with the current series of Evolution and Revolution EA's, I am thinking of instead of playing strength...playing the weaker of pairs.

ie - IF EURGBP is in an uptrend and EURUSD and GBPUSD are also in an uptrend, play the GBPUSD pair.

Converse for Shorts...

Reasoning?

Goes like this...

By only trading a single pair, based on strength and weakness of the actual currency, we are limiting profitability.

Which is kewl, if we are also limiting risk, right?

But...

Given the actual hit rate on some of these, I think that playing the fast frames on short ranges will result in more triggering on the weaker pair, helping to make up the difference.

SO...

The idea...

Evolution EG filtered to trade on ALL EUR and GBP crosses...2 separate EA's, 1 for GBP and one for EUR.

I've kinda got the logic worked out in my head...just need to translate and put it into code.

Backtesting on this will be 100% ineffective as you cannot use 2 separate pairs as guidance...already found that out in previous testing on this idea.

It's a movie marathon weekend with the wife...will keep the thoughts flowing, but may not have something for a couple more days...

ALL GREAT FUCKING THINKING though!

Love this group!!

I had the best performance last week from AUDJPY pair. I feel so that it does make a lot of sense to see currency correlation with this EA. I will put these listed pairs and see how it plays out. In reality, one does not need a bunch of pairs. But I guess currency strength per time affects the performance of these pairs. A non-performing pair this week could be the winner next week. Its worth investigating like you suggested.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Real Question Here...

If 90% of all Forex Traders are total fucking market catastrophes, why limit orders to 200?

I mean...what is there about this arbitrary number that makes it relevant?

Let's assume that most dogshit brokers never let your money enter market anyways...why not allow you to continue to trade until you completely run out of money on positions?

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Dumb FIFO rules could complicate things esp with so many open positions i think

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Good point...but...a lot of brokers that aren't restricted to FIFO have this same policy.

Why?

What is magical about the number 200?

Does that mean that the market will reverse on any pair that sells 200 Bear/Bull Candles that don't retrace?

Actual Coders, which I am not one of...study this kind of statistical shit...I'm not about to go all counting candles, but is this part of the Algo of success?

Magix, I have the worry that something is wrong. Last week Revolution 1.3 performed great. On 16.03 at 13:03 GMT the expert closed all transactions. You see the result. I closed the expert. Today I opened the expert at 01:30 GMT with the same settings, I got it on a template. Up to now 10:45 GMT, has not opened any deal.

Absolutely the same situation is with Evolution 1.1a.

Where am I wrong? Should I do something? Magic number is the same from last week. The two experts are on different platforms.

Thanks!

Magix, имам притеснението, че нещо не е наред. Миналата седмица Revolution 1.3 се представи чудесно. На 16.03 в 13:03 GMT експерта затвори всички сделки. Виждате резултата. Аз затворих експерта. Днес отворих експерта в 01:30 GMT със същите настройки, имам го на шаблон. До този момент 10:45 GMT, не е отворил нито една сделка.

Абсолютно същата ситуация е с Evolution 1.1a.

Къде греша? Нещо трябва ли да направя? Магическит номер е същият от миналата седмица. Двата експерта са в различни платформи.

So the 2nd test of mine, Revolution v1.1 has come to an end.

Its been an interesting test, and I've learned a few things from it. First and foremost I think that this test was not a true representation of the actual results as for the last 2 weeks the account was at the 200 trades limit. This I think negatively affected what the EA was able to do.

Some positions racked up huge DD's, but without the space available the EA was unable to open new orders to try and cost average them out. I was being adventurous running 20 pairs and it quickly caught up and maxed out. All in all though the EA did do pretty well despite the large DD which i think could have been lower if the EA was not limited on trades.

20% growth in 1 month is still good, and if the EA could have operated normally without account trade limits I think it would have made even more. Well lesson learned and in my next test I'll only be running the pairs that I had mentioned earlier in my previous post.

I've actually reduced the list from 8 pairs to 7 as it was still USD and EUR heavy so now I will use only 7 pairs in my next test all equally balanced.

Hi Magix,

Just let you know I took down Rev 1.3 https://www.forexfactory.com/telac#acct.22

May add another NN and change pair combo - will let you know.

Magix,

Just wondering how my cpu is gonna fair on this and also Welldone

I'm almost done setting up the explorers

My first bunch will involve 1min timeframes with Evolution 1.1a - Revolution N - Lost sock E, I'm trying to get that fine balance within my basket pairs might reduce it along the way as per the '200 cap'

The second bunch will involve 15min timeframes with only 1 or 2 pairs on each versions as DD will most likely be very high I will later on probably add a unique style of renkos aswell

I did notice a few members have already got a hold of the Evolution NN would it be possible to send this to me aswell so that I can add this to the mix

Ok after clearing some space on my VPS when Rev v1.1 finished, I've now loaded up Revolution N!

I'll be testing this on a $1k account with my 7 special pairs as I mentioned previously. I really don't know how well these pairs will perform compared to Magix's 7 pairs, but this month we shall see!

Hi Magix

Hi All,

So, my single pair (GU) 1.3 demo has ended, EA was caught in a trend and eventually killed the account.

During this time it did take some small profits but not enough to negate the early losing trades.

Version N, on a 5 pairs, 1K demo, is currently at 30% DD from a single pair (EG) and continues to buy, so far, the demo account has enough margin so I'm keeping it automatic.

On my small live account the GU move with V1.3 killed the account so I've re-deposit and will launch hte EA again when I have accumulated more funds.

It's nice following this EA, seeing how and when it tkaes trades, still not able to understand it completely but I can, at least, understand some of the trades' logic.

Everything going as it should I think. Not bad for 3 weeks of test.

I will share a little obvious trick. I checked on most of the TEs and noticed that low ADR pairs close pretty faster than high ADR pairs. So in the new account, redistributed the lots.

50-70 ADR: 0.05

70-100 ADR: 0.03

>100 ADR: 0.02

I however allocated 0.05 to some high ADR pairs e.g. GJ and GC because I noticed the turnaround time for trades were also quick most times.

Play around with the settings, the bot is cool.

Alrighty Then...

I know...finish the code and get it released...but here's the thing...Long day, half in the bag and really, I got enough issues with this coding shit when I'm totally fucking sober...so, in the meantime and in-between time...let's check some of the TEs out and analyze what this all means and how we get shit working better in the up and coming...

Gunna start off with Evolution 1.1.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is the version that I set to Summ Start Lot...ie, it adds incrementally to each position...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.....

Before the total dogshit action and spread variance of good Friday, this motherfucker was actually holding zero positions and all was in profit.

Which is kewl...

$2k Start, M1 chart, 7 pairs in trade - 20 days of action (minus the weekends) and was only set to increment after the first few days.

This motherfucker has seen some Draw Downs - To be Sure - but I also started it when EURAUD had already taken off and had a few positions that it needed to cost average out.

What does that mean?

Well...the cost averaging is A LOT more aggressive on both evolution and revolution than the original 'start trading logic' is, so it had to bury itself a little deep on some of these before it made good on all of them.  In all honesty, and due to the logic and what I've seen with others using the Martingale Setting, I figured it'd be BUST long before now...

Instead...

50% gains in what is really a couple of short weeks worth of trading on a $2k start with never seeing more than 50% in Draw.

That's actually pretty fucking impressive if you ask me...

BUT WAIT!!

There is a change that will be coming that will help on the original trend definition on the primary to help keep a little better in the good graces of market.

For all intents and purposes, it will soon look to start trading more by way of breaking out of range and also be a little more sensitive on rebounds.  Given it's current success and what I have for my personal Marti...this should put it in the running as the absolute BEST that Evolution can be!!

In theory of course...we know nothing until my coding proves positive and the ideas actually work out...and of course, there are always exceptional market situations.

Risk is always on!

Here's the thing...as a part of this, it will be looking at Daily Open and Close...the logic should be traded to a TRUE DAY and by that, I mean it should trade NY Close as daily open and work in a 24 hour cycle.  This is where shit gets deep...if you have no idea when NY roll over is, or if your broker has their EOD at NY Roll, you will need to figure that shit out.  Part of the reason this hasn't been implemented up to now is because it causes a lot of questions that will be repeated over and over that my attention span and patience have little tolerance for...

Yeah...mostly...I am an asshole.

But I am trying to be better for you...just going to have some hair pulling moments ahead of us.

Here's whatcha need to do...

Look at the FF trade day, home page, bottom right hand corner and simply confirm that your brokers end of day aligns with it...otherwise...you will need to adjust.

OR

If you believe that London is the better start to the day...figure that shit out, same way, and adjust!

I've been trading NY roll for years now and have it applied to my personal logic and traders, seems successful enough so I don't bother fucking with it...that's not to say you need to do the same.

AFTER THIS...

Study the difference between Fixed Start and Sum Start lot sizes and make a differentiation on which one you would prefer to use.

Summ Start, a lot more aggressive, a lot more risk, a lot more profit.

Fixed Start, slow and consistent and easy to close out the week at end of week...

Once this is all put together and compiled, I will be adding it to post one and will update the thread.

Revolution NN...

Gawd, I love this motherfucker!!
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

After having made a change - to my personal versions - not thread updated...it's managed to keep the accumulated positions for redistribution lower and still maintain a fairly good clip on the profiting side of things.

At just over 1 month in...

Sitting with $1000 in profit and very low DD, trading 21 pairs.

No...not huge, but consistent and after adding in a Better Filter for the Homeostatic direction, it keeps itself a lot better in check.

Now...I could just release this motherfucker and be VERY positive about its future...but why leave it just at that if we can shake shit up a bit?

How So??

Well...it's like this...

The original version was written for the M1 charts...which minimizes the range of profiting.  Keeping low DD and consistent profit is good...but what if we can stretch out the charts and increase the average closing from 5 pips to 6, 8, 10???

How??

Glad you asked...

If we increase the TF, we can stretch the range.

By being a little less sensitive on the time frame and closing logic, we can possibly move this fucker to WHOLE NEW LEVELS!!

Up to date, this could have run 21 pairs on a lot lower account value...meaning, we can either increase the lot size or decrease the account start and really make this fucker work!!

Personally...I LOVE what bishopdotun wrote a couple of posts back!!

Dude is a fucking GENIUS!!

ICYMI ->HERE

Where we have been treating all as equals, he has figured out the HACK to pairs based on their ADR - Average Daily Range!!

Brilliant!!

If we know we are working in shorter ranges, we are minimizing DD and can increase the lotsize.

If we know Pairs typically close out faster, we can adjust range, profit and account size...

I've been working through some of this manually - as applied to AUDUSD, but never really considered different settings for the EAs...

THIS is why I love working with a community.

I am a total fucking moron, so when the rest of you are chiming in, no matter how trivial your posts may seem to you, they CAN make HUGE strides in our community of progress!!

LOVE IT!!

Working on Rev2...again...will update as is posted!!

IN THE WORKS...

Now, I know I said I wasn't going to release a version of GridMeOut...but see that there may be a great market potential for a lot of manual traders with this idea.

I am working at a public release of a CLOSE ALL GMO EA that can hopefully work as well for others as does for me!

There really is a lot to this, but the potential is fucking AMAZING!!

Imagine working with ideas from Davit's Pivot thread, setting your first trade either manually or as a pending order, and having the EA add as is needed and close out at your predetermined profit??

I will have a very GENERIC version in play and will be opening a new thread for this and hopefully will be leaning on a Brother Shitposter who fed us the idea for NN -> Redeflect ->TE-> HERE

Small setback on this week, but check out his manual EQ!

AWESOME!!

This is what we are working on with our ideas and if we can further garner ideas from him, as well as other manual traders, imagine what we can achieve?

Q1 is OVER and we are just getting started...

CAN YOU FEEL IT???

It's going to be a fucking AMAZING YEAR!!!

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Along these same lines I was thinking the the "Minimal Profit Close" could be tied to ADR - like a fraction or % of the 5 day average ADR. It would be an input. This would make the capture for every pair dynamic and more relevant I think. For that matter I guess ADR would also have relevance to the "Step Order". I'm sure that using ADR in the right ways would tune things better than a 1 size fits all approach.

Things gonna get exciting

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Just added an old tool I used to play with on Post 1.

i-Sessions indicator.

This will help you plot out the individual sessions, may be useful with the new EAs coming.

It does not automatically configure broker to actual Market Time or align sessions, those are manual inputs.

SPINS:

For NY...if your true time for NY Close is 24:00, you will have to enter 23:59...

IF you only want a single session to show, change the color of other sessions to None.

An interesting market view to be sure.

NY Session for EURUSD:

I have looked at these as ideas as well...

My major issue in past was, what happens if the daily trend reverses and you are caught on the wrong side?

But!!

Given that we are now playing bi-directional with group ranged profiting while still allowing other positions to remain open, may give us another lift on profit range.

Good stuff, brother!!

Let's get these in play and I will work on adding as we grow!

codes actually doing ok. hard work. one simple q, why u dont back test 1st but forward?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
I do run Backtests in the "Strategy Tester"...but for only the purpose of verifying triggering...ie->testing the strategy.

Reports by the Strat Tester do not show an accurate depiction of account growth and draw, in fact, even on the logic portion, they can be a little misleading.

You may come to realize that for all of the flawless EAs out there that turn $10 into 12 million in 2 months, typically will turn 10k into Ash in less than 2 weeks...there are no backtest champions who made millions off of the Due Diligence of working with the strat tester and I fear that anybody that puts any faith into these results that goes live without having any conceptual idea of the Draws against the account in a live environment will, in most cases, not like the results.

Long story short:

Backtests are Bullshit!

--- 帖子 #909 ---
short in long

back test is not bs especially when it comes to alvorithms. 100% mechanical system will do same in d future what it made in d past.

u r just losing time. bt each imstrument then cobsolidate reports into one see what will apprx happen in d future.

u r hoping an algo will work in d future that wont work in d past. or forward testing an algo where u dont like bt results. this is such thing like doing exact same thing w expectations of different outcomes.

difference can only happen because of market randomness but not because of algo itself. then if ur expectations is based on randomness ur code can be as short as 1 line includes rnd ()

sorry but u r actually/partially foolin ur self. no insult. just my thought.

bt n optimization r different things.

short in long

if u expect it to work in d future then u should expect it to work on d past too

good luck

Revolution maintains a low enough Draw that I have upped the anti on this...instead of running same lot, I've got to summ start lot to see if we can make a little more progress.  Did the same thing with Evolution NN - Still not available for public release...

If Evolution 1.1 can run this, without exploding, Revolution makes for an even better candidate. Will see how things go on that.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In addition, have had a look at the original Evolution trader, still running after 81 days and we are approaching 200%...makes sense that if at .01 we turned an account after 60 days, by doubling, we should be able to make it to 200% gains in 90 days...right?

When I first looked at this idea, as mentioned by mrdfx, I figured that after another 60 days, we would have 300% gains after 60 days and double the lot size to .04...but, now that we are approaching 200%, it almost makes sense to up the lot to .03 to make the next leg of gains, no?

Now there's been some serious Draw Downs at this level...but there also was on the original .01 start...so...really, why keep equity - Especially with Play Dough, if it's not being utilized.

Sure the Risks go up, but are we effectively scaling, if we're not actually scaling??

Over the next 10 Days, we should see this value be 200% gains...and it shouldn't matter what the unrealized value looks like...which will definitely be RED...because we know that we are still closing over 80% of the trades in profit, still capturing 5(ish) pips per trade, why not just add in a little more profit to get $1.50 x 80% of open trades?

I mean, really...

If we don't test/break this fucker...how will we really know what the boundaries even really are??

--- 帖子 #917 ---
The Math...

Pretty Simple to figure out...really..

If we look:

1.  Number of Open Trades - 74...current.

2.  Multiply this by what we have maintained consistently over the last 80 days...

3.  Multply this by the Win Rate, which we have seen minor fluctuations on, but ultimately, static to above 80%...

All we really need to look at, is the value of the pip to increase the actual speed of gains...right?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now...the market has been chop and somewhat limited range...but do we really know that will change anytime soon?

Seeing what we have on the AUD pairs, GBP and EUR for Range, who is to say that we don't see more out of this motherfucker if things actually change?

Yes...The risk increases, but this is based on the amount of equity...

If you are gridding, and this is your concern, STOP FUCKING GRIDDING!

Yup.

Keep the magic number the same and you are all good.

The intelligent cost averaging

Good thing I done this when Aud pairs were going wack though trying to the max out on a really low balance their was never a situation when you'd be called for margin it never hit the negative red always seems to cost average through

Final results can't show the screenshots as my vps server was switched off by its provider  I can never find a decent one  oh well maybe a dedi next time or just use my home PC

I will just type the scenario here for now the drawdown has reduced to basically nil the overall starting balance was at $150 now its at $294

from observation this fucker doesn't flinch

Next steps will run from scratch again set up a new TE with Revo NN1.2

Been holding quite a bit of DD this week from EC, and its finally starting to come back.

I really like watching this EA pull in the negative positions, and close them out to profit.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
I hear ya, dude...

Having spent years fucking around with these, I still wake up every morning expecting at least one of these motherfuckers to have blown up an account...

Not that I am sadly disappointed that they don't, it's just been much time waiting for the proverbial Sword of Damocles to fall...

Seeing them get in deep now changes the expectation to instead of demise, into, this means profit.

If 80%+ of all open positions are going to result in profit, I am shifting into the mentality of wanting to see more Draw Down and More Open positions.

Completely all of the wrong market logic...

Almost makes you wonder why people keep spouting the same rhetoric only to lose when these break the rules and thrive, hey?

please remove revolution 1.3 thanks.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
[quote=Magix;10924076]Revolution NN... Gawd, I love this motherfucker!!

I'd have to say that this is the pick of the bunch for me.

DD is really good, and profits are steady.

The OOTB settings are awesome, so as I try to make more profit with it, all I'm doing with it changing the lot size....nothing else, if it works this well with the OOTB settings, all I'm going to do is increase my lot size as my equity grows.

Always regretful for the great minds at work and the awesome community at work here.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Just so you know what you are looking at...

This is a VERY conservative cost averaging EA that directionally trades to a homeostatic range median...meaning...it doesn't get a lot of action on a single chart.

I did have it at default but did move to Summ Start to give an incremental lift to the trades.

On a single chart...you might wait days to see a trade.

Here's all of the pairs it's had in trade for the last 46 days...Never come close to the 200 Trade Max threshold of this broker.

so i need to put it on all pairs, can we program within the ea to add pairs to trade on

like EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY

so even if the ea is placed on a single chart it still trades all the pairs added to its lis t, this saves ram

Hi Magix,

Does the NN TE above using the new NN 1.2? The DD is absolutely unreal!

Maybe due to Summ Start? I think it was in the hundreds few days ago..

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Hey Magix, been MIA from this thread for a while, but I have been checking up every week or so. I've got a new VPS up and running now, so loaded up RevNN 1.2 demo, on a wide spread/no commission account. This is to test an idea I have - If you were to go live with this, there are cashback programs that give up to $7 a round lot cashback for certain brokers. With the the amount of lots that this thing racks up daily, this could potentially add about 25% extra profit per day! On the flip side, the extra spread may be detrimental to the performance in that it can't close out positions as quickly, slowing profit, and entering larger draw down, but we shall see!

https://www.forexfactory.com/1qaz2wsx33#acct.42

--- 帖子 #952 ---
This is the No Nedge...

$49 for an incrementally added trade seems to be very reasonable to me...

And yes...this is the thread released version.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
This is definitely worth a shot!

If you go through the TE's, one thing to appreciate is that they typically never absolutely Nut a chart for entries nor exits...meaning?

There is some flex on either side.

This may help out with a wider spread to help out with the extra gains.

Question is...

Are the spreads 25% higher than you can get with other brokers?

Because, if they are, you are pretty much at a wash with extra cash back to tighter spreads...kind of pound of feathers to pound of bricks, idea.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Yes on most pairs they are, so you are probably right. My thinking is that positions will close for $1 anyway, so does it really matter if they have to travel a few extra pips to get there? So if you could manage to close out the same positions almost just as quickly, you would be better off. Of course if tight spreads means that we can close out 4 positions for every 3 that the wide spread account closes out then we are back to being flat like you say.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
That's why it'd be worth giving a shot...doing the calculations manually, with a flex in spread and crazy shit at roll over...really hard to tell which way things would go.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
FINALLY!!

Some useable fucking DATA on these!!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Revolution, Evolution 1.1 and Evolution NN were all switched over to Summ Start - meaning...they add incrementally to the previous position.

The idea behind doing this was to see which of the logic would prevail over EXTREME conditions.

Now...it looks like we have our winner - Revolution!

Revolution has a secondary code in it to be a little more aggressive in counter triggering.  This has added in additional positions, but has also allowed the flex in market to keep the DD well under control.

Where Revolution is running on 19 pairs the Evolutions on only 7...pretty easy to see and say that $155 in the shitter is a lot less than the $2064 and $1668 on the Evolutions.

Here's the thing...

We couldn't go flat out with all of the same pairs on the Regular Version of Revolution as we maxed out the 200 trade threshold of the most brokers in less than 2 weeks...we wouldn't want to go with only the same magic 7 pairs on the NN version, because the profit, though steady, might make picking bottles in ditches more appealing...

So...

To sum up...

LSE, killer EA.  I've bumped lots on this up to .03 and $3 profit...figured we were close enough to that next 100% that it'd be worth a shot.
Revolution NN...can run very well with either Fixed Start or Summ Start and continue to churn the cash...risk is the only consideration under summ start and adding in additional lots for Fixed with a wider profit might be the way to go.  With the Filter Added in the current version, and on a smaller risk account, this motherfucker is GOLD!

From starting with this triggering idea, some 10 months ago...finally at a place to start improving?

Still the daily filter to drop into Evolution and get released...got this started a couple weeks ago, hopefully polish it off over the weekend.

And then...testing through Christmas!

w00t!

Alright...so I might have cheated this a little...but seriously...

60 days at .01 with a $1 profit to double an account.  Doubled the lot size and profit and it took another 30 days to get to...well, okay, just short of 200%

On my micro - Fuck Around - Account...I was playing with another GMO idea.

Fairly Aggressive and you have to maybe add this to a longer than M1 chart and maybe only look at enough pairs that your account size and margin can handle...

Meh...

The idea is solid and may be married to one of my others for trend to counter-trend trading...again...longer time frame...less pairs...more funds...will be testing.

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Evolution and Revolution - No Nedge...

The idea on the trading to a Homeostatic Market Median is still ROCK fucking SOLID!

BUT!!

When writing in the No-Nedge Logic, we've seen the failures of this, as applied to Evolution...a little less on Revolution.

When originally coding the traders, they were set to directionally trade...if you look at the success of Evolution - 200% gains in 90 days...easy to see we are doing something right...right?

But...

When dropping in the No-Nedge, as applied to Revolution requires a separate out of trend logic to keep it in the good books.  I'm not a fan of this, even though it has proven to be fairly successful..in wicked ranges on goofy pairs, this motherfucker could spell ultimate demise for any account.

Both Evolution and Revolution NN versions are still set to only initiate a trigger when they are in proper cycle trend and trade towards market median.  The problem with this is...this creates a really narrow trading range and has actually caused the EA to start tripping over it's own nuts causing catastrophe on Evolution NN (with the incremental add)...

So...

The logic works in trend...falters out of trend and can get hung by the balls in extreme situations.

Ergo...the bug in this idea is that since we are trading towards a target, we know we can hit...why wait for true multiple sequencing on trend to work backward?

I think I can take ideas from both of the NN's...drop it into a hybrid...throttle back the sensitivity...and remove the Revolution out of trend trigger.

I know...I am supposed to try keep focus and have a couple of EAs that are way past promised dates...but I think this one will jump line along with at least one basic idea for the GMO concept...

Should have some time this weekend and already stocked up with the weekend provisional suds.

Time to get fucking HAMMERED and Tap into Creativity!

Enjoy your weekend!!

--- 帖子 #962 ---
GMO - Trend60...

So...the idea behind this, which may be obvious from the pic...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Is that instead of using a price grid, it uses time and is specific to criteria...

Looking at it..rather than buying as price slides against it...it triggers into the primary and looks to shorten the range for profit.

This is one of the modified version trades it made...I was changing code with almost every trigger for a while, just to get it to do what I wanted it to do...

Overall...it does have potential, but again, viewing this on an M1 and especially if you fire this motherfucker up in shallow waters, could get you into some serious troubles.

Anyways...this is just a sneak a peak at the idea.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Not sure what I was looking at or working on when I wrote Evolution NN...some pretty fucking wild ideas written into that motherfucker...

Primary version of Hybrid NN written and testing in Strat Tester to make sure triggering is correct.

From all indicators...which isn't live testing...I think with the Hyrbrid, we can improve the win rate and the average trade value.

This should help make up for fewer trades and less overall Draw Down.

If all goes well, will have this fucker posted tonight!

You've got the entire weekend to Backtest your heart out and NOT POST BACKTEST RESULTS IN MY THREAD!

Very Kewl!

--- 帖子 #966 ---
One last thing to mention about Hybrid NN...I have coded in the market median into a longer look and because of the less restrictive trade ideology of the new trader, it can actually be applied to an M5 chart...due to logic restrictions, M5 is probably the longest chart it will trade on.

Might not be that beneficial, but it's a start...

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Hi Mr. Magix,

is your EA restricted for Live trading? I tested your RevNN.1.2 at micro acc where is min. lot 0.10 and suffix (e.g. EURUSD.)

Thanks for answer.

Updates

The pictures below are self explanatory. Summary of the Revolution and Evolution trading

- I changed all to sum start

- I do daily check of ADR movements to adjust the step

- All on M1 (The ADR adjustments will help limit the trades)

Evolution 1.1 / 35 days / 18%

- 6 pairs

- Step increased to 200 to give room for stacking
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Revolution NN.1 / 22 days / 8.2% / Live and still in red

- Reduced to 16 pairs

- Step increased to 150
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Revolution NN.2

- Same as NN.1
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I just setup Hybrid NN on my VPS

- Same settings as NN.1

- 14 pairs (selected based on WTR:ATR ratio)

For all pairs the WTR:ATR is between 1.5 - 2.7

- With this information, I know the max range for each pair

- With the introduction of median filter, I know the range from which the EA will trade

- By applying the ratio of the range, I can better control how many trades it will place

- If I see that the ratio is increasing, I increase the step accordingly to reduce the max number of trades possible. At least I am only trading from either side of the median (1/2 the range).

To use this in a live environment, you should understand what it is doing or it will blow up the account quickly. Sometimes, I take it off pairs that have cleaned the table to allow room for other pairs to trade. Especially when number of total trades has exceeded 100.

BTW: I watched the Hybrid NN trade offline today. It's cool. Great job Magix. Please which time frame median did you implement for both Rev NN and Hybrid NN?

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Timeframe=M1.

If on anything other than that, you most likely will never see a trade.

There is no restrictions and no expiry on anything released in this thread.

If you are still having issues, post your log files and I can check shit out from this side.

--- 帖子 #970 ---
2 New Trade Explorers added, taken away the 2 busted ones.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Going to start these off with the Magic 7 pairs, M1, Default Settings.

Difference?

One has an additional trigger built into the Hybrid EA.

Though I am not totally convinced this is required, it may help in the cost averaging and time in trade.

Exit logic is the same...so, we should have a true comparison for the value of a supplemental trigger instead of just the hybrid NN logic.

I will be away for most of next week...doing a little traveling, some out of town business and commitments.

Will be checking in, but limited in any sort of analysis...

Have a Great Week!

Good Luck in your trading and testing!

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Magix many thanks for the new Hybrid NN version.

I was reading and catching up with the developments, am I correct in saying that Hybrid NN is an amalgamation of the logic Evolution and Revolution along with the No Nedge code added?

I'll be setting up Rev NN 1.2 TE this week, and I'll load up Hybrid NN as soon as I can. I've got some tests finishing up soon so I'll have some more space on my VPS, and I can give these a spin.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
The TF for Rev filtering is off the M5.

For Hybrid, it's off of the H1.

Both view the Homeostatic median range off the weekly.

Issue is, due to signal triggering, Revolution will not trade in anything other than an M1...Hybrid will trade off of the M5, but triggering logic on the initial release may leave some large holes in spacing...

I do want a longer version of the NN logic, but think that this will still ultimately need be applied to the faster frames.  Reason?

We can extend triggering, like with your analysis for Market Range and I can always extend the exit logic to different ideas of profitability and dynamic ranges...

Applied to the longer frames, it's a lot more difficult to apply pattern recognition.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
This is correct.

Hybrid has been compiled off of the better ideas of Both - Evolution + Revolution - with the NN Logic in place.

The Triggering, more leaning towards Evolution, the logic in range off of Revolution and the Dual filtering off of the daily trend removed.

This may make them a little less conservative but should improve the tradeable range.

ie - More Risk=More Reward.

In theory...anyways...

--- 帖子 #974 ---
So I removed the Evo 1.1 M5 test. M5 wasn't doing as well as I had thought, and it was holding more DD than on M1, with not really any extra profits, so for me its been confirmed that these EA's perform better on M1 charts based from my tests.

With 1 extra slot now open on my VPS I have loaded Rev NN 1.2 on a new $1k account trading with 5 pairs using sum start lot. This should be an interesting test.

Hi Majix etc.

The EA tests look great - I love the element of crowdsourcing.

Bit of a newb question, but what are these EAs doing - what is the strategy? What are the rules for the EA in relatively basic (non-code) language?

Is there a specific post or thread I could be directed to if the info is there?

I always like to know what the EA are doing before I use them.

Many thanks

Hello guys, totally noob here, I just came from BO so im trying to catch on. Sorry to ask basic things.

Tried to live test RevNN with a 1000 account in 6 pairs but only opened 1 trade and keeps saying - Not enough money. Standart settings.

Can I modify something? Or it needs a bigger account?

Testing the Hybrid EA on the same pairs that Majix is testing the Rev NN - scarily good

That's really not much at all, even RevNN which seems to be the lowest DD so far has been over $500 in DD. You really need at least 1k, probably 3k to be safe from margin call.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
I guess a lot of people would be reluctant to invest 3k in a bot that's barely in testing .. don't you think?

Also, if you have a $500 DD and your initial investment is $500 it pretty much means there is something wrong, and your strategy is flawed, just saying ...

Agreed... I'm in the same situation with USD/CHF as you seem to be with EUR/NZD... Two trades opened yesterday morning that are -140 pips and 3 more yesterday evening that are -100, for a total of -240 pips floating on that pair.

From what I can gather, the EA looks to trade reversals, correct? When it gets faked out, it then trades at another potential reversal point to average out the original loss... which begs the question - what happens when it gets faked out several times in a row?

Not meaning to be overly critical here. I appreciate you sharing your hard work, Magix.

Plot this onto any timeframe, select whichever values you want...only using it as a visual representation...

What you will see is that the histogram moves above and below the Centre Line - ZERO - and tends in a direction...until market reverses.  Given that this continuously oscillates above and below, we look to the basic idea behind it.

As price is tending back towards the Zero Line, from Below, we look for opportunities to take long positions.

As price is tending back towards the Zero Line, from Above, we look for opportunities to take short positions.

Given that this EA is set to an M1 chart, the Central Line is a Weekly Median and we can trade inside of a tighter range...recognizing the trend is one piece of logic, as in, is market currently long or short...recognizing when there is market weakness is a second piece of the logic and triggering out is the last.

Because of what we have accomplished with Evolution and then Revolution, Hybrid has taken the best ideas of both, tried to Maximize the profiting as well as increase the probability of success in exit logic.

2.  Proprietary.

3.  There are breadcrumbs throughout the thread and a lot in my 17,000 other posts.

This has been a long time in the making...a lot of pieces to put together and still not perfect...but definitely getting better!

I've stretched out the chart for ranges, via moving this to an M5 to capture the week on GBPJPY...it's a good example of what is actually happening...not something you can't see by playing along and analyzing at home...but if you look, left to right you will see:

1.  Shorts with profitable closes - Red Box.

2.  Buffer - No Trade Zone - Yellow Box

3.  Longs with profitable closes - Green Box.

4.  Buffer - No Trade Zone - Yellow Box.

5.  Longs to close out the week - Market Short - Trade towards weekly Median.

This is all done via Market Range - there is no clock built into the trades - Per Se...but there is some delay based on movement.

That is the last piece of the puzzle...

Kinda generic...I realize...but ya know...a fella has to keep some secrets.

Check available leverage.

If less than 500:1, probably not going to see a lot of trades.

And...probably not going to be that successful with any of my M1 logic.

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Hey Chris, welcome to FF.

A lot of people SHOULD BE reluctant to enter into the Forex Arena...but that doesn't really stop them.

As of the last statistics I've seen, there are nearly 2000 new Forex Accounts PER DAY...I would guess that there are probably as many that crash and burn on the same days as well...

I do agree that $500 DD on a $500 investment leaves a lot to be desired...but that doesn't mean that these cannot be employed on a $500 account.

Risk can be minimalized by trade pair and by leaving the default settings, Most specifically - Type Lot - Fixed.

I would hazard a guess that on some of the limited range pairs, this wouldn't give fast growth, but would give you a better return than what the banks give in a savings account...

That being said, it is recommended to have at least $500/pair and a minimum of $2k in the account and stick to the Magic 7 pairs.

If you check out my TE on Evolution - HERE - it shows that given this as an account start size and increasing the lots proportionally to the Margin hasn't run into the "pant shitting, dear Gawd, what have I done" levels...though...50% on this account has been a given risk area.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Welcome to the thread, dude.

Feel free to add a TE, I keep all of our current thread testers on the first post...will get this up to date over the weekend.

The more data - Pairs and Brokers - the more successful we can be as a group.

\m/

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Your reasoning is sound, thank you for the warm welcome!

I've been testing Hybrid NN for a few days now, however haven't really paid attention to the pairs.

Will take this valuable information into account and apply.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
As you can see from my trade explorers on Hybrid:
HERE

&&
HERE

These projects are still in the works.

Difference?

Well...there is 2 different logics for triggering but all based on the same movements(ish)...

Where Hybrid is a little more aggressive in the primary triggering, Hybrid ET has an additional triggering methodology that plays a little more like Revolution.

What does this mean?

Well...it's like this...

Evolution has been trading for about 9 months. No...not the one in thread, the trade methodology. And...for the most part, greatly successful in its path. There have been some modifications and I have changed out the core of the EA to give it a better fighting shot, but ultimately, 9 months without blowing up an account and the current version is doing a lot better than all other predecessors.

The reason for this is that instead of waiting for the sum total of all trades to be greater than the minimum profit range, it looks for a summ of the best and the absolute worst trade to be in a minimum profit area and then will close out these out, leaving some stragglers behind. In working with this, it has allowed for a lot more trades and trade sets to be closed and has increased the profitability on the same pairs dramatically. Where the original version doubled a $3k account over 6 months, the current version has done this in less than half of this time.

Next...let's move over to Revolution NN.

This motherfucker is a little slower at taking trades and a lot less profitable. Due to the NN logic, it is only trading BACK towards a homeostatic median...not trading the actual trend. In addition to this, there is another trigger that helps fill the open space in direction of the losers to make cost averaging a little more effective.

Here is a screenshot of an M15 chart on Evolution - It's trading on the M1, but the screenshot of an M15 chart shows the full range of trades for Cable.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

There is over 200 pips from current to the top of the trade chart.

That's a lot of bone to make up...but given that we whittle away at this and when there is a chart turn, we get a cluster of trades, these have been mostly and effectively traded out...over the last 100ish days...there is no reason for me to assume that this will change now...

Evolution was coded to help minimize buying tops and selling bottoms...but guess what?

The market sometimes has an idea of its own and we are left with an account that can amass a large amount of DD, especially when traded on multiple pairs.

Revolution was coded so that we could eliminate some of this drag by being a little more conservative on triggering and to help eliminate the use of the TDI + CG indicator...it's not a terrible indicator, just has too much drag.

NN was dropped in place so that instead of trying to figure out where overbought and oversold were...we would only trade back to median and fingers crossed...never end up with this pile of shit...

SO FAR...NN is kicking ass in this department.

BUT!!

The problem with Evolution, Revolution and NN is that they whittle away the range of profitability.

In taking the M1 and the large retracements to the Homeostatic median, there isn't a lot of meat left on the bone.

When removing some of the filterings, taking the better ideas of both of these and dropping them into a single trading logic...I still needed to use 2 different versions. This is to:

1. Have only the cost averaging and triggering logic of Evolution, without the TMI + CG, like in Revolution

2. To Extend the Range of profitability by extending the exit triggering

3. To have 2 versions - one that operates ONLY like Evolution on the backside and the second to have an additional triggering like Revolution.

to

4. Test to see which is the actual better mousetrap.

In all of this, I could still actually code in 2 more versions and may still do this, but will see how these motherfuckers run and work from there. Core is in place so either changing or creating an additional trader isn't that big of deal.

NOW...

On to your question...

lol

YES...there is some range that's created by these and maybe more on some than others.

Revolution, with the Summ Start is trading the same pairs as you are...the NZDs, but is more refined in it's ranges...will these work out the same as Revolution??

Dunno...

Evolution as with most of my trading, works on my Magic 7 pairs.

Does better on some than others...but for the most part, I believe this boils down to the actual Sessions!

My market theory is that ALL areas of the chart will be covered by BOTH relevant trade pair sessions - if they are major traders.

AUDs, not always the same, but AUDUSD falls into the USD Session and has an impact on movement for GBPAUD and EURAUD, as well as London Session will move this back to range by strength or weakness of the GBP pair...EURAUD, well...fuck them...they go along for the ride.

Have a look at a session chart:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The boxes are only London Session.

If you pay attention to these, you will see that for the Most Part...London ALWAYS covers open to close - DAY TO DAY - and leaves no GAP unfilled. It's sometimes an Eventually, but typically works out to be within a MAX 5 days.

Without this...it's like the "Market Gap" from Friday Close to Monday Open.

GAP ALWAYS FILLS!

Well...Almost Always...

Fills to Lows or Fills to Close - 99% of the time, fills back to London Close Price.
(Watch for the AREA IN GREEN on my GBPUSD Chart)

So...what about the NZD Pairs?

I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE...

I mean, I have them added to my Revolution account, but never pay attention to it, so really...your guess is as good as mine.

Given the logic being employed, if they are Summ Start, there's a good likelihood that it will backfill enough to close them out - Like Revolution.
(Best Guess)

TL;DR Version...

Stick with the Magic 7

Work along with Revolution and Hybrid

Let's see where these motherfuckers go!

Pro-Tip...

Watch for the GBP backfills next week.

Could be a bumpy ride, but if traded right, you should make out like a motherfucking BANDIT!

Hybrid - Week 1.

Having a look at the stats, so far, looks promising.

This could definitely change as time goes on...but here are some of the things I am looking at.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Profit Factor:

10.34 - Never seen this on any previous version.

Where Gross Gain is 10x greater than the losses...pretty fucking incredible!!

Might have been a fluke, but we'll see more how these play out in days to come.

Average Trade Pips:

This too is most likely subject to change.  Prior to the GBP spike, this was hovering around the 8.5 pip range.  This is a definite increase over the 5.x(ish) pips of Evolution and Revolution, so even if this throttles back some, we still see an increase in profitability of 60(ish)% over previous versions.

Win Rate:

90.6%...well...in the early days of Ev and Rev, the win rate is higher.  As we move along, there are bound to be some good days and bad days that shorten this back into the 82% win rate...hopefully??

Overall...a Stellar Week for Hybrid...but it's only 1 week.

Could be a FLUKE!

Could be a sign of some pretty fucking incredible things to come!

Dunno...exciting though!!

Revolution vs Hybrid.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now...this is a little interesting...

Revolution, trading 19 pairs and with a summ start lot - Net profit on the week $180 vs Hybrid, trading the Magic 7 of $159.

Revolution, 254 entries...closing off some from the previous week, closing a total of 268.

Hybrid, 137 entries...only closing 128 - Week one, no carry overs from last week.

Lots Traded:

Revolution 8.29!!

Hybrid only 1.28...

That's a pretty fucking substantial difference in trading and risk, for the difference of $21 profit.

Now...

Revolution is only holding $4 in DD, while Hybrid is at $47...but STILL!!

WOW!

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Here's what I am not so fond of...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Negative pip value!

What this means, if you are still increasing equity, is that you are doing it at an increased rate of risk.

True to be said, I have blown up a lot of accounts both live and demo, this is the typical sign of an eventual account bust.

In a lot of the Grid Strategies you will find, it works out to be an all-out Negative Value to see the Equity increase.  This gets scary and Fast!

Yeah...these accounts are playdough...but I still run this shit live, meaning, I analyze the fuck out of everything now before it ever hits my hard earned money.

Revolution has gone back over the last few days, but the overall value of return is still in line with the pip increase.  Meaning...that although we slid a little this week, the methodology of the trading behind this is still actually fairly solid.

Check it:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Return in blue, Pips in yellow...

It's only over the last week(ish) that the methodology of the EA has failed, where the profitability has still been gaining...meaning, we have 2 things in place.

1.  A solid trade strategy to allow consistent profitability.

2.  A solid cost averaging strategy - when Sum Start or an Incremental Value is added - to allow the EA to work itself out of tight corners.

If is either one or the other, this can show an equity slope that goes top left to bottom right, instead of the current.

Just figured it'd be worth mentioning...really, a lot of this shit is stuff I see and say when analyzing my own trading.

Repetition is the mother of knowledge and well...I can use all of the help I can get.

Hi Magix,

I was thinking of using your EAs but I would like to know which Forex VPS are good to use? I'm only gonna use one or two MT4 platforms. nothing special.

please let me know. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Hey Rogelio,

I have no idea who has a decent VPS these days...for a platform or 2, there are probably a lot of great providers.

I'm currently working through the process of a setting up a custom solution.

Sorry...can't really help out in these regards.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Thanks for the detailed explanation.

So am I right in assuming that your Magic 7 pairs are E/U, G/U, A/U, E/J, G/J, G/A, E/A ...?

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Correct.

Now...in saying this, it doesn't mean that other pairs may not do as well.

If you test other pairs, which isn't a terrible idea, you may want to take this same approach -> HERE

There is something to be said for diversification and profitability, but it requires some testing and drilling down into more specifics.

The simple idea that these all left at default working on all pairs, when all pairs do not exactly move in the same ranges or have the same economic impact, wouldn't really be a fair and true test.  Application of the ideas can pass, where the profitability if suitably modified, could produce a lot better results.

Or...pick a pair, a couple of pairs...apply these to a single account with a larger lot size start and larger profit range...

Or...Set the Magic Number to Zero and you take a primary trade, activate the EA and let it grid you out.

Lots of different ways that you can apply these and their only true limitation is how you choose to work with them.

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
I may have just picked the wrong pairs (or wrong time) to test. Currently, -1,150 pips in drawdown with the Hybrid NN nearly all of which is on USD/CHF and USD/JPY

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
I'm not a huge fan of USDJPY...and have never really touched the CHF pairs.

USDJPY...looks like it could be another 2 days to retrace to weekly median, under typical moves.

Just a guess...that being said, it should only look to cost average after today...

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
alright. no problem lol I'll pick one and go with the flow hopefully without any issues.

For Shitz n Gigglez...

Added a Grid Me Out EA to post 1 - Xuicide Scalper

Reason for the name...if you don't know what you are doing, this could easily suicide your account!!

I fuck around with this on the M1 charts, so left it defaulted to my settings.  This being said, you can change to whatever time frame you wish and just edit the Time delay (in seconds) to the time frame you are using...ie - M5=300, M15=900...

If you are changing the TF, you probably want to increase the profit, but may not actually need to.  This will play dynamically and is set to exit when bid is against your profiting candle.  Here's a quick trade that I took with the EA, all of the arrows, obviously EA taken trades and with profit set to $1, total on this was $2.33.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When trades are against the trend, it will look to FORCE immediate Closure, like the below.  When it does this...as bid flickers, you may come out with a few less pips.  The result of these trades was $.88.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Current set for .01 lot and fixed lot calculation...if you want to get dangerous, play with the other options...just be aware, this will trade until:

1.  Stop loss Hit.

2.  Profit Hit.

3.  You are out of Margin.

4.  You max out on your broker threshold for Max Open Trades.

Please play with this on a Demo account before trying it out live...

I've already blowed up a couple of accounts with versions of it...

Current play, lull market times this week:

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Uh...I guess I should mention that YOU MUST TAKE THE FIRST TRADE in order for this logic to kick in.

Apply it to all charts, it will only start to work once you've fired off your first shot on a pair!

It will only Trade the pair you've taken a trade on.

And...because I left the Magic Number as a User Input, you can set this to work with any other EA Magic Number and it will work with other logic to get you good.

I haven't played with this...simply not enough room for additional traders right now and I don't want to fuck up the stats of my other accounts.

It's fun...once you get going with it.

My revolution 1.3 finally blew up............  but the EA is still amazing and I will now go over the trades and device a plan on how to run the EA and make some beer money.

For those that do not know--- I was stress testing the EA by letting it run 24- 7 with no manual intervention..... the EA was up over 600$ at one point and then slowly got into DD.  by looking at the trade history I can see how to run the EA with manual intervention and drink some free beer.

Its one of the best EAs I have ever tested and for the most part I find EAs just a waste of time but this EA has given me some hope that maybe an EA can be profitable if used properly....

Thanks Magix for your all your time and effort in this

Hi Magix,

Could you possibly add the steplot function to Hybrid?

That would be great. With that I can reduce my step order and lot. I am playing around with some low ADR pairs and this function could help me validate some parameters I am testing. Thank you.

Hybrid is amazing as usual. It ended the week with a blast.

Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Hey dude,

I've fucked around with the Steplot function on the original code and couldn't actually make it function, properly...

Given that my abilities are refined to a copy n paste solution, can you provide an MQ4 file that has a Steplot Function that I could try to apply?

Awesome Job on the testing, my friend!!

Revolution N opened trades OK, later version does nothing.

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Hi Magix,

really love your Xuiside Scalper EA, thanks for that one

Even if it has been asked before (too lazy to go through the whole thread):

Would it be possible to change the close of all open orders in case of TP target reached to "order close by"?

That would mean @TP Point in case you are net long 1.0 the EA would open a 1.0 short and close all orders with a  "close by"?

You don't get slipped as you can get when closing single orders

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Seems to me, if there were issues with the coding of the latest version, we would have more members that would have brought this up.

Check your configuration and Log files and try again.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
I have worked with multiple closing logics and found this to actually be the most efficient.

Given the fast frame that I've always worked with, I do appreciate that this is definitely part of the strategy and have worked to get it resolved by exit strategy.

There are times when you get some slippage against you, but typically more times than not, it will be in favor.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Hey Magix, I checked on my REV1.2 after I had noticed it didn't close or open a trade for a whole day, I found this in the log.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I closed an reopened mt4 and then a bunch of trades closed and opened, and now looks to be working ok again. Any idea why this might have happened?

All default setting except I made magic number 0

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
MT4 is really as buggy as batshit...

But...it is the tool that I can actually work with.

I have had the same thing happen, on one of my live accounts, last week and I take full responsibility for that.  Running a heavy load by way of multiple terminals and running close to Max on my PC for resources, I typically shoot for a weekend reboot just to keep shit working good...well, I've been busy and a little lazy and never got around to it and consequently ended up with a restart being required.

It was fortunate that no large losses came of this, but is still much the reason that I keep Teamviewer loaded on every device I have and monitor my live shit throughout the active trading sessions.

One other thing I have noticed, but this goes back to when I started again in September of 2017, is that the comment on some of the EAs for Cable, Stops Printing in the comment line on trades taken.  No fucking idea what this is all about...so I just reload defaults and it comes back for a while and then will disappear a couple weeks down the road.  This has no impact on the trades as trades are controlled by magic numbers not trade comments...but, it's kind of annoying...

Moral of the story...reboot your system and reload your terminals when markets are closed...and report anything that stops working altogether.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
I tried but didn't find any.

The function is in RevNN1.2. You may want to have a look at it again.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Yup.

It's in there...

It don't work and I wasn't able to fix it, thus the reason it was removed from subsequent versions.

Not sure what happened today, but Hybrid crashed and burned, I woke up to see this...

It was going well up to this point but it seems that GU was the killer..

This was a $1k account trading my new 5 pairs with step lot. Using step lot was an experiment to see how it goes, perhaps that is what killed the account?

Besides this account my other Hybrid NN test is doing pretty well with using normal fixed lot.

Rev NN 1.2 is lovely, just lovely. This thing has been purring all month long pulling in pips with almost 0 DD. Magix what ever you did with Rev NN 1.2 its working man!  The profits might not be very high, but its constant and consistent.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
USD Crosses are definitely on a rip right now...causing a lot of DD with all of the versions...

April Played out much like January did and the hybrids are playing much the same as did in January - With TDA taking it's worst beatdown during that month.

Consequently, we will most likely see the same DD with Hybrid as was on Evolution in the early days of testing - 50% DD on $2000 account start with the magic 7.

We seem to be testing some Yearly Open Levels, have posted on this in other threads...

I'm still using Hybrid on one Live account, vs Ev/Rev, but being very selective on pairs and movement.

My strategy with these to help reduce DD...watch for Oversold on the M5 - with daily in mind, set when the trend is against the EA on an M1, cash in profits, rinse and repeat - All on Fixed Start.

Not screaming profits, but no pantshitting levels of DD either.

Slow n Steady, wins the race...

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Ok I've opened a new $1k demo using my same 5 special pairs, but this time only using fixed lot instead of sum start lot. I think in these market conditions this will be the safer approach, and still be able to turn consistent stable profit.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Hi mrdfx,

Would you be able to share your EA settings for the Rev NN 1.2?

Have you been adjusting Step Orders throughout at all?

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Everything is run on default except for lot size I'm using sum start lot instead of fixed lot.

Sum start lot is working well for Rev NN 1.2 so far however it did not work very well for Hyrbid NN.

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
So...Looking at the 2 different versions of Hybrid I am running...

One more like Evolution, one more like Revolution and neither of which, at current am I really fond of...

True to be said, there have been a few exceptional market days, but who cares?  We need to have something that will not only play the short in trends back to a Homeostatic Median, but that can also be a little more effective on the long yards.

Thread Released Version:

Problem with this...waaaaaaaaaaaay to large of a gap to be effective.

Problem with this...waaaaaaaaaay to many positions to have to cost average out of...

Now...I am still not terribly sure, by end of week, which will be the winner...or if either of these motherfuckers will even cross the finish line or end up hitting the skids.

One is too Slow...

One is too Fast...

Maybe we need something a little in the middle?

Half Fast?

lol

Get it?

Halfassed!

lol

I slay me!

But seriously...in working out the triggering for Xuicidez, it made sense to be a little more aggressive on the backswing.  As it turns out when played right, this is very effective...but, can easily blow up an account if not worked with a little more sensitivity.

So...Halfassed Hybrid, triggering in trend, removing the grid?

I like it!

Will work on this over the weekend and see if we can't put both of the predecessors to shame by way of lowering the DD while keeping a better profitability.

Overall...this has been a great week to stretch the limitations of Hybrid...and Evolution...and Revolution...Pretty happy about that!

Hey Magix this week has been one hell of a ride true that! It has really given a stress test to the EA's and through these market conditions you can really see the strengths and weakness of each one.

I've been playing close attention to both of your Hybrid TE's, and from what I can see, the normal Hybrid is performing better overall. Yes it has slightly less profits, but it also has lower DD and less lots traded.

Unfortunately my Hybrid test crashed this week and could not survive the stress week, but I also suspect that it was from using the sum start lots instead of fixed lot, as my other tests are still running ok. I think sticking to fixed lot instead is safer and still turns profit.

I still think Rev NN 1.2 is a champ and its really doing well and loving life.  Whatever you have running inside that engine, its

I think if you can work on the Hybrid version that you say is more like Rev NN 1.2, see what happening under the hood, you can fine tune some things, and with a little mix of Xuicidez you could create a beast.

For my own experience the original LS running on M15 has been my champ. It's not as exciting to watch as it trades in clumps, then leaves things alone. You go through periods of DD but in the end it wins without so many added positions and keeps margin happy. I'd say it borders on incredible

BTW this demo started with 3K!!

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Excellent results Telac!

Have you been running the EA on full default settings, or did you change anything? What is you average % DD so far?

$5k profit in 2.5 months is very good!

I tried M5 previously but it did not do so well for me.

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
Trading .1 lots - takes a lot less trades on M15.  At the beginning I had some DD in the 50% range but this was largely due to the mass trades it sometimes took on the daily rollover when that ugly chop happens.  I have since installed an EA that turns autotrading off for about 45 minutes during that time......now all good.

It's not about me...

It's not about you...

Think of the Children!!

Dear Gawd, I can't believe I am stepping into this arena again, but will giver a whirl.

Okay...so we've had some fun...we've seen some risk...we've seen some reward...and the cost of this has been, well, on the development side for you, absolutely nothing. Sure, you may have spent some resources on your VPS in testing and maybe you haven't actually stepped foot into the arena to make or lose anything, but it's still what and who we are as a community!

Now, I have stated, that the last thing I am interested in, is getting back into the charity game...but yet...here I am!

Why?

Fuck...who knows...it's just what I do, I guess...

So...

Here's the deal!

If I can get 50 people to agree to a $5 USD donation to the Ronald McDonald House, I will release the next innovation of Hybrid.

Disclaimer...It may not be any better than anything that is current...it may actually offer more risk.

You may not ever make a dollar on it!!!

But really, for a $5 USD bill...

50 people that will commit to donating $5 USD to the Ronald McDonald house, and the next version is released.

Link -> HERE

Do 1 of 2 things...

1. Let me know you are in -> message in thread and we can build some momentum.

2. Donate and post your receipt ->keep your private information out.

Really...$5 USDx50, not a lot of scratch to come up with...maybe there's even 1 person that would drop down $250 USD and free this up for the bunch...whatever...

Anyways...

Thems my limits!

Let's work as a group and really, be thankful for what we have and pass this spirit along to those less fortunate.

Or not...

You pick!

Do you see it?

Do you see the issues with All Versions?

Check it!

No...sure it's kewl when it only triggers when price has stalled in one direction...but here's the dealio!

Price Drop in Green box...yeah, don't judge me...Red=Sell, Green=Buy...normally, this is for illustration!

There is no opportunity or any reasonable opportunity to grid into this motherfucker on a dynamic range to capitalize here and not fail in other areas, but where the red box is, no additional trades are taken!

1 trade cost averaged in, to carry how many trades above??

Pissing into the wind, is what this is!

The red box is gold, not speculatively gridding into an exodus...when this motherfucker is buying back!

That is the missing link!

That is what I will write into the charity bot!

Been a very interesting week, to say the least...

Even with the USD strength this week and trading 21 total pairs, Revolution NN has managed to trade itself out of all positions and is currently sitting flat...waiting for some new beginnings...Very Kewl!

Weird that the Trade Explorer still shows open trades though...

Hi to all and especially thanks to Magix for all the good work and ideas you are sharing with us here.

I would like to ask if anyone knows how works the "step order" input in any version of LS expert?

Is the minimum distance of each new order which is opened by the expert or what?

What represent the default value of "20"? Is it 20 pips or 20 fifth decimals of pip?

Thanks in advance to anyone for any useful information to my questions.

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Hey Dude,

Sorry I missed your post.  Been playing around in another thread with the latest release -> HERE

The value is points...default is 20 points or 2 pips.

Because of the logic, this is a Minimum Distance by is dynamic and logic will wait for a trigger and a minimum space of 2 pips before entering a trade.  Because of this logic, we create a more dynamic playground and don't end up massively loading trades on a single large spike down candle.

Trigger on Grid.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
Thanks a lot Magix

I understood logic of step order and triggering of new trades.

You completely covered my questions

Hello

I have been running a test on RevNN 1.2 for the last couple of months.

I finally settled on the settings of: Lots 0.05, Step 0, Target $10.

The pairs were: EU, AU, ECad, EG, UCad, and UY.

On demo I was getting great results on a $12000 acc. (Pic. inserted).

On the 4th the DD hit margin. You can see that the EA was recovering well.

I put the EA on a live account and instead of averaging around $350 per day it was making $60 on a $35000 account.

This was strange so I tried using a Trade copier from the Demo account onto the Live account.

It was at this time that Win10 decided to do an upgrade and since that time the EA has stopped functioning on all accounts and platforms.

I have removed and re-installed platforms and the EA but to no avail.

I have also placed the EA on a different computer and even that has not taken any trades.

HELP!!! This is a fantastic piece of work and I would like to get it restarted.

Thanks Magix for all your input and effort.

I don't know why it has uploaded some of the images twice.

I got rid of some of the images.

Ignore last message.

Seems to me this is more of a patience issue than is with Windows 10 or the EA on the different computer.

Most of the pairs you have listed have no trades or in the case of AUDUSD and USDJPY have just recently taken a trade since your post.

My suggestion, for future...

Compare the pairs you are trading to my open Trade Explorer on Revolution NN ->HERE

You can see all of the pairs in trade in the Trade Report and compare your open positions to its open positions.

If you run into any other issues, please post in thread.

Great that we can all learn together!

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Thanks for the reply.

I closed each platform and restarted several times. Then I added lots of different pairs just to see if something was moving. One of them did a little while later so I removed all the exotics and waited. Now everything seems to be working fine.

The AudUsd and the UJ are trading.

I think there was just a bug in MT4 as there were no trades for the last two days for me.

Thanks for your time.

Hi Majix and all,

I see the thread has been dead for over a month - is anyone else still trading this EA (Rev NN)? I see you moved focus to a different thread Majix. Is there an update of the EA or is it still the same as in the first post?
