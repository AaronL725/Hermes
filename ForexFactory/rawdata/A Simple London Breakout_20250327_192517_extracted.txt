Here is a simple London breakout strategy based on a variation of my BoxFibo indicator from my London Progressive Strategy thread.

I simplified the indicator to place the initial entry points just between what would normally be the 27 and 38.2 fib extensions on both sides of the box. I didn't want to extend it past the 38.2 extension, although it can be feasibly accomplished, because the farther away we move our target, the tougher it is to reach the intended targets as it move in proportion to the box size. I wanted to make sure we had a higher probability of reaching our target.

The Profit Target line was carefully calculated to produce the same amount of pips as the box size. So, if your box size was 40 pips, your Profit Target lines should be exactly 40 pips from your entry point. Because of the smaller box size, this is not intended to grab a ton  of pips, but to hopefully increase the success rate our trades.

You will need to place the indicator on a 15 minute chart. The start time is placed from 03:00 to 06:00 GMT, which is the 3 hours leading up to the Frankfurt open (if your broker's GMT time is not GMT +0, you'll need to adjust the times accordingly depending on your broker's GMT time). My broker is GMT +1 so I will start at 04:00 to 07:00. The obvious reason we put this before the Frankfurt open is to have the box drawn before the volatility kicks in and before the breakouts occur.

With regards to the trades that occur, you can handle them various ways. You can

A) take the first trade you get and just make one trade a night, win or lose, or:

B) take all of the trades that present themselves, it is your choice.

If you trade using option B) and still have open trades when the new box forms, you can leave the trade til it hits either you Profit Target or stops out, or you can close all open trades before the start of the new box around 03:00 GMT whether your trade is in profit or not, which is what I prefer to do so not to overlap the trades. I prefer the latter mainly because if I decide to incorporate any *Martingale type of approach, I need to know the new lot size I need to use before the next trade presents itself.

The nice thing is that you really don't see a lot of trades in a row that are losers. The most I've glanced at was 4-5 in a row, so you could experiment with a *Martingale style approach and increase lots on your losers to make up for your losses. Take 4-5 low spread pairs (i.e. Eur/Usd, Usd/Jpy, and so on) and play around with it over the next several days and over the weekend and then starting on Monday, the 12th, I will pick out a few pairs and show some examples of how the trades would have unfolded. You should see roughly around a 65-75% win ratio overall. The pairs I will be monitoring are:

Eur/Usd

Gbp/Usd

Usd/Jpy

Eur/Jpy

Usd/Chf

I highly suggest to not take trades if the box size is over 40-50 pips  on all pairs.  Generally, this is  because a larger price movement has already occurred  before the open  and will make it more difficult to reach out targets.  I'm not saying  it's impossible, but use your common sense before you  place any trades.

Good luck!

*** Bug fixed in both indicators. Thanks to sangmane for the fix. New indicators and templates loaded.*** 4/12/2010

***Just a small note, I have updated the two  indicators and templates in post #1 with the changes in the code that  nightyhawk has made which included the MaxBoxSize parameter and  the ability to change the level color. The Fibcolor  input parameter was removed as I saw no changes when the input was  changed. If you are using a 5 digit  broker, please add an extra "0" to get the correct MaxBarSize.*** 4/15/2010

***A big thanks to Steve Hopwood for modifying one of his EA's to fit this strategy. The current version is from post #292*** 4/19/2010

***Indicator modifications done by sangmane and squalou are now incorporated to include that you can now change the color of the box if the box is greater than the  MaxBoxSizeInPips input. You may also adjust the SessionEndTime color as well. You can now also change the entry level and profit target levels. The default levels in the indicators now are carefully configured to have the profit target from your entry match the box size. There is also a LevelResizeFactor parameter that has been added which allows you to fine-tune the levels if you want them different from the box size, but keeping the box as the basis? For example, if you set it to 0.7 (1.0 is the default for normal trading), then all levels will be adjusted as if the box  was actually squeezed by this factor, still centered to the actual box  "median Price". Post #357 has some example pics and a more detailed explanation. Thanks gain everyone for their contributions.*** 4/22/2010

***V7 of the Indicator has the following improvements:

- shows "Profit Zones" in green (can be disabled by input)

- displays the box size in pips below the box, and a "NO TRADE" sign for  red boxes;

- puts a chart-Comment on top left corner with the main settings so you  instantly know what they are for that chart;

- sets system-wide Global Variables for use with the treat below...

Squalou has modified Steve Hopwoods's "London Breakout script" (presented on  post #138 and attached here), go read it to get the scripts basic usage.

This new script will take advantage of the improvements added in V7  indicator, so that you do not need to manually enter  entry/TP/SL values anymore!!!

Here is how to use it:

-1- load the "London BreakoutV7.mq4" indicator (or  higher version) on the chart;

-2- drag the script to the chart, and just click OK, that's it.

The script will automatically replace input values left to 0 with the  corresponding entry/TP/SL levels for the BuyStop and SellStop orders  that the Indicator has computed using your indicators inputs, so you don't  need to manually input them. You can use the script on charts open with different pairs each. Use "F3" key to show the created GlobalVariables. You can change their values directly there, these will be the ones taken  by the script. They will be updated automatically when a new box is formed the next  day. *** 4/28/2010

***V8 has the following added inputs***

This version will allow to keep SL/TP levels into "reasonable" min/max  limits on days with too-high or too-low pre-breakout volatility...

It has 2 more inputs acting as box size limiters.

Don't want your TP/SL levels go off the roof ?
Just set the "MaxExtentInPips" to whatever  box size you don't want to exceed, and that's it.

And for those days where you think that the box is too  small, and you could surely harvest more pips than what the  tiny green strip suggests...

then just set the "MinExtentInPips" !

Of course, as usual, ignoring those values (default 0) won't change the behavior of the previous versions indicator... just to keep you feel at  home...

Thanks to squalou for all the improvements. If you have any technical questions on the indicator or script parameters, please PM squalou directly, thanks.*** 4/29/2010

***Complete package is now added in a zip file which now includes:

Steve Hopwoods EA (modified by squalou)
Indicators (New V.9.1 Indicator)
Scripts

Any questions, please PM or e-mail squalou for specifics.*** 5/6/2010

***An alternative setting is currently being tested starting in post #647. The alternative settings and rules can be found in post #506***  5/11/2010

***V4.0 version of the EA...

New features:

- Added Trailing Stop capability

New inputs:

TrailingStopPips(0)- pips to trail the StopLoss; when 0 no  trailing is applied (fixed SL as before).

TrailingStopStep(1)- trailing SL will jump by this amount  instead of trailing at every tick; (helps limit the number of sent orders, and therefore order  rejections).

- Added  profit lock-in after fixed profit:

"BreakEvenPips"- when "BreakEvenPips" is >0, SL is moved to  BE+"BreakEvenProfitInPips" when price has reached BE+"BreakEvenPips". Works independently from "AllowHalfClose" option (but uses the same  BreakEvenProfitInPips value); Will also be trailed if TrailingStop is selected; (inspired from Steve's MPTM EA...)

"MaxRisk"- if >0, then  order size is the min of Lot input and calculated max Lot based on  MaxRisk and Stoploss;

- All open/pending trades will be closed when the EA is unloaded;

- replaced order-related functions with "reliable" versions of them...  (will retry 10 times at timed intervals if call fails).

- when MagicNumber is 0, a unique MagicNumber is created by the EA,  MagicNumbers will be different for each pair/timeframes. This helps running the EA on different pairs/timeframes without having to  manually change the MagicNumber.

- added Alerts when the Indicator Settings Global Variables cannot be found. The  EA will stop trading in this case.

- fix: in V3.0, objPrefix default value was not set to "LB-" as it  should have been, leading to error 130 "invalid stops".  5/20/2010***

Just so you can see the setup in action, we already have a trade completed on the Eur/Usd for a quick 22 pips! More detailed examples on next Monday. I will be out of town starting tomorrow, but I will answer any questions you have as I will have my laptop with me. See ya Monday!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
What TF do you use. This will be important as the box will not be drawn until after the 7:00GMT candle has finished.

If it is on 5 min chart box could be smaller than 1 H chart etc.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
A quick look at the chart above shows a 15 minute chart. Good catch , I will edit post #1 with that info, thanks.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
do you use stop loss?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
i read the initial post several times, downloaded the template but i couldnt get these simple things

1. where is your stoploss ? is it at the other end of box ? its not mentioned in the initail post

2. where will you put your buy order ? at 27 fib extension ? 38.2 fib extension ? if both are ok, why you need the other one ? cant we fix one number ?

3. if stoploss is at other end, then risk reward is less than 1:1, you mentioned 70-80% win rate, that would traslate to BE or a slight positive number. is that correct ?

4. in the template , i changed the times to 05:00, 08:00 (my broker is GMT+1), but the entry exit levels didnt change, but the box is redrawn

5. would you trade only europe pairs since this is london b/o ? do you have similar b/o for US ? which is the best pair to trade for london ?

6. you mentioned you can enter several times, we need to keep redrawing the box ? if so you take last 3 hours ?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
It shows the stops on the indicator for you.

Again, look at the indicator. Your entry point is already there for you. The entry points are calculated to be just above the 27 ext. on the first indicator and just above the 38.2 ext. and the second version of the indicator. The extensions have nothing to do with the entry, they are just for reference. You are not being forced to use either one, I just added the second indicator as another option. Use whatever one make you feel comfortable using. Just remember, if you use the second indicator that your profit Target lines will be spread out more and more difficult to hit.

Yes, the R/R is less than 1:1, but not by much. Hypothetically, if we use the Profit Target and Stoploss ranges from the chart above and take 10 trades and use a 70% success rate, we would have this:

(7 x 22 pips)---154 pips minus

(3 x 31 pips)----93 pips

-------------------------------

total pips--------61 pips

Now, if you do 10 trades a day x 5 days in a week, you'll end up with 305 pips. I'd say that is a lot better than BE, wouldn't you? I know a lot of traders who would love to have just 20 pips a  day, let alone 61! Yes, there are better systems out there, but I doubt there are very many as simplistic as this. Remember, there are people out there who praise the FAP Turbo and Megadroid EA's, and you only make 5-7 pip profit per trade and yet have 100-200 pip stop losses. I'll take this any day of the week.

I'm not sure what your asking, but the entry and profit target lines should change as the box size changes. Can you post a pic of what you're trying to explain, that would help.

The strategy works best with the GBP/USD. Because this pair trades lightly outside of London trading hours, the surge in trading every morning in the U.K. gives it a “real” market opening, which the strategy looks to exploit. Gbp/Usd trading is virtually nonexistent during Asian trading hours. When London opens, however, the Gbp/Usd accounts for nearly one-quarter of all forex trading. Currency rates with more continuous, 24-hour trading will have less of a distinct open/close as they pass through the different trading sessions. For example, the USD/JPY, which dominates Forex activity during Asian trading hours (78 percent of volume), still accounts for 17 percent of trading during European hours. So, as you can see the London trading session can affect every pair you trade, just pull up any chart and see for yourself. Looking at the diagram, you can see how the 4 majors have the highest activity in the London session.

No, you don't redraw the box. The indicator redraws automatically each day at whatever time is set in the parameters. Once the box is drawn after the Frankfurt open, all trades are based on these levels until a new box is drawn the next night. For multiple entries, once the price retraces back below our original entry point or reverses and hits the opposite entry point, you have the discretion to enter additional trades if you choose. I will show everyone more examples of this on Monday.

Thanks for the info mike1349, as I always tell people, my strategies are not set in stone and are always up for personal change to fit you own style of trading.

Thanks for posting your system. I like breakout systems, No need to sit in front of the charts all day! Just set our orders and stoplosses and get on with the day.

These systems do show profit long term and whilst they won't make you rich over night, they could do in the long run with the right leverage!

This seems to work on EUR/GBP with the 2nd indicator, very well. This is because the box is usually very small.

It does have a very good win ratio if the box is less than 30 pips!

I've been thinking about adding further indicators to filter out losing trades but actually I think indicators keep you out of more winning trades than save you from losing trades, so i'm not going to bother.

I'm going to start trading EUR/GBP on Monday 12th on live account. I'll let you know how it goes.

Might trade GBP/USD too but only if the box is <30.

Great comment, Every newbie out there thinking of starting Forex trading should learn this mindset first along with learning Money Management. I have built up my accounts over the years after learning the hard way that all these strategies and EA's that claim you can double or triple your account are a bunch of crap and are just there to drain your wallet. I've always believed that if your EA or trading strategy was that good, why sell it?

Thanks, keep us posted on your live trades since that is the best way to validate a trading strategy, live forward testing. The pairs I'm going to work with are the 4 majors pairs (Eur/Usd, Usd/Jpy, Gbp/Usd, and Usd/Chf) and also Eur/Jpy and Eur/Gbp. Since you can let us know about the latter, Eur/Gbp, I'll just update and analyze the first 5.

Again, it's good to see other traders change it up to fit their own style. I was thinking of doing something similar on the Usd/Chf, using the 2nd indicator and limiting the box size to only 30-40 pips. It does make sense as these two pairs do not have the range of the others.

Hi MEr,

First thanks for sharing this i  think it has good potential this strategy, (indicator) really usefull. I came on a idea to filter out bad trades more sometimes it goes both ways you dont want that so how whe filter this.

-EMA 84 close.

Put a EMA 84 on your chart when the EMA is in the box for a day whe dont trade. It most be in the box when it is touching just the sides no problem then it is oke. when box is above EMA whe only looking for longs when price is below only shorts.

Oke Guys hope you got something on this

Thanks for the strategy. Sure looks great on GU and GJ. There seems to be nearly no flaws on these two pairs. On back testing others EU and EJ and EUR/GBP only has 50% to 60% success rate while UJ seems to have 70-80 % success rate. I have tweaked the strategy to my taste a bit.

Here is my tweak:

The breakout is from 7 to 10 GMT. I take the trade 5 pips below or above the box and set my TP on fib value of 161.8. 0-100 being the low and high of the box. SL being 5 pips below or above the box opposite of my trade.

Here are my charts:

wow !!! great explanation. thank you so much mer071898. i will do paper trading for a week. will do major 4 pairs

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Since US brokers not allow one to hedge, how do you get filter those false breakouts?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
ingmarforex, I appreciate the input. One question, is the EMA set to close or something different? Let us know if you are testing it out and if has helped you out. For those who want to incorporate the 84 EMA on your chart, feel free to do so. I will be just utilizing the London Breakout indicator only on this thread for now.

You are welcome.

Glad to see it is working for you, I hope you have success with your tweak. I just want to make sure the thread doesn't get too bombarded with everyone's variation though. If you have a different strategy or variation, please open a different thread and discuss them there as I do not want to have any confusion from the original strategy, thanks.

I try to be as clear as possible but sometimes you just have to re-iterate what you say to make sure people fully understand everything. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them the best that I can for you. Now keep in mind, I'm only using the major pairs because most trader's are familiar with them and are traded more frequently. You can use this on ANY pair, I just prefer to use it on pairs with low spreads to maximize my profit potential.

First off, There is no hedging going on, you are only in one trade on a pair at a time. You are either getting stopped out or have already hit your Profit Target before any other trades are being taken.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Mer

Forgot to ask, do you add on the spread to the entry levels? What are your thoughts, not sure it's going to make much difference.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hello, first of all, thanks for sharing your system and having programmed an indicator for it.

I tried your system over the week-end and I realize that sometimes the Buy StopLoss is the upper part of the box, sometimes it is the lower part of the box. Is this meant to be like that ?

I checked the code and there is no specific reason to me (I thought eventually depending on the size or volatility for example) but, and correct me if I'm wrong, it might just be the result of the High/Low logic when you draw fibs and box at this specific step:

if(tlow > thigh) {

pt1 = vLow;

pt2 = vHigh;

}

else {

pt1 = vHigh;

pt2 = vLow;

}

ObjectCreate(objname,OBJ_RECTANGLE,0,dt1,pt1,dt2,pt2);

ObjectSet(objname,OBJPROP_COLOR,BoxColor);

objname = "BF-Fibo-" + dt2;

ObjectCreate(objname,OBJ_FIBO,0,dt1,pt1,Time[ib1-FibLength],pt2);

Should that be corrected ?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I do not figure in and add spreads with regards to the entry. I just enter at the proper entry point and close at the Profit Target. Whatever the spread may be at the time of the trade is just the cost of doing business.

I honestly don't have an answer for you as I have never had the indicator do that to me. I have no coding knowledge as another trader here at FF coded the indicator for me. As long as you remember that the stoploss is always the opposite side of the box from the entry point, you should be fine. If anyone sees anything odd in the code, you are free to fix it.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I did backtest with the following settings:

- Entry as soon as price hit the defined level, exit at defined Take Profit

- StopLoss other side of the box

- Only 1trade/day and no entry after 5pm

- USDGBP only.

for 2009:

Results: start with 3000$, end up with 3842$ - 0.1lots for each open trade. (thus a true strategy profitability testing without money management)

(2010 till now: start 3000, end up with 2700)

As depicted below:

251 trades, an average of 2 consecutives wins and 2 consecutives losses .... suggesting a potential martingales but with quite some risk, although max consec wins is 8 compared to 4 max consec losses.

For 2009:

I will post the problematic days and eventually some ideas to filter big losses (I think it will be necessary) and/or money management (Hedging, "why cut at profit when riding a trend....") .

Does Frankfurt open the same time as London?

Frankfurt opens an hour earlier than London.

Cheers. Just adjusting times for my platform.

First off xmph, I assume you meant Gbp/Usd. Secondly, is this an EA that you have built for this, because I would be interested in seeing how you constructed it and to be able to forward test it. Now don't get me wrong, I appreciate the input and the help, even  though I am not a big fan of backtesting. I just personally feel backtests do not show the  true potential of any strategy. Manual forward  testing, even only 6 months worth on a demo account, makes me more optimistic than 10 years of backtests would, no offense. I would highly suggest allowing the EA to take more than 1 trade a day because a lot of the time price is initially reversing off the fib level in the first trade and a lot of the time you will catch your Profit Target on the second or third trade of the night.

Frankfurt opens 1 hour before the London Session at 07:00 GMT. I started at the Frankfurt open because there is always some movement during this time and we don't want the box size too large before the breakout occurs.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
There is a bug in the indicator that may reverse the buy and sell stops as xmph has pointed out depending on how the fib is pulled to form the box. Until I can get this fixed (unless xmph knows a fix), please remember that the top of the box is always your initial sell stop and the bottom of the box is your initial buy stop. My apologies to everyone if there is any confusion.

Hi guys,

Yes, vLow is always less than vHigh...  I'm glad to know that some trader use this indicator.

I want to explain the meaning of tlow, thigh.

PHP Code  int thigh = iHighest(NULL,0,MODE_HIGH,(ib1-ib2+1),ib2);
int tlow = iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW,(ib1-ib2+1),ib2);

from above formula, thigh/tlow shows the position of the highest/lowest price.

if thigh = 2, it means the highest price is 2 bars to the left, start from the last bar. if tlow = 5, means the lowest price is 5 bars to the left.

so, if tlow > thigh, in this case 5 > 2, it shows that the price reached its lowest earlier than when it reached its highest during a specified interval, which means we have swing high. i use this info to decide how the fibo should be drawn by code.

regarding buystop that sometimes printed in the lower box edge and sellstop printed in the upper box edge, it is caused by the code below:
PHP Code      ObjectSetFiboDescription(objname,1,"Initial Buy Stop = %$");
ObjectSetFiboDescription(objname,0,"Initial Sell Stop = %$");

I missed this one until Mer told me today. The above code assign Fibs description regardless how the fibs is drawn (swing high/swing low). To correct this issue, you can make the following changes:
PHP Code      int ibuy, isell; //addition
if(tlow > thigh) {
pt1 = vLow;
pt2 = vHigh;
ibuy = 0; //addition, for swing high, buystop at first fib level, ie. 0 level
isell = 1; //addition, for swing high, sellstop at second fib level, ie. 100 level
}
else {
pt1 = vHigh;
pt2 = vLow;
ibuy = 1; //addition
isell = 0; //addition
}

and on the objectsetfibodescription:
PHP Code      ObjectSetFiboDescription(objname,ibuy,"Initial Buy Stop = %$");
ObjectSetFiboDescription(objname,isell,"Initial Sell Stop = %$");

hope this help

is it possible to attach the right version of indicator and template?

thx

--- 帖子 #39 ---
attached below the corrected version of previous London Breakout 2 indicator. now buystop is always on the top edge of the box, sellstop is always on the bottom edge. also this indicator permit you to use StartTime = 22.00 and EndTime = 03.00. you can use London Breakout 2 template located on the first page

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yes a dirty 1hour-coding EA, modding the indicator to use it as an input in the EA. It is quite ugly, simple and stupid. It does only the simple thing I said.

Backtesting, Forward testing .... what I care about is money in my account .... that is forward. Do you trust something that has been backtested over 10yrs .... I don't as the market will most probably behave differently in the future ... however would you have a better feel at the strategy's behaviour ... I do. Make the most out of what you have ... my line of thinking ... every piece of information is worth gathering.

I will share the EA most probably next week as I believe I will have a little time to make it less dirty next Monday (not before) - I want it to allow for  testing different filter if some amongst us are coders.

Thanks for sharing.

PS: my only concern with such an EA .... I think there have been tons of breakout strategy EA on FF and I don't know if any are really profitable, or if this would not be re-doing what others did (eventually better). What do you think?

0400-0700 GMT Breakout Strategy 2892

4H Box Breakout 5023

BREAKOUT seem to rule

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Basically, when you are either stopped out or have hit your Profit Target, when the price retraces back to your entry point you may take another trade if you wish (see pic).Last Thursday, April 8th, was a very good example. We could've had 7 possible entries that day, 6 winners@ 16 pips each and 1 loser@ 21 pips. Now as I said before, you do not have to take every trade that presents itself. Some people may only want to take one trade a day and others may choose to trade more if the are willing to put in the screen time.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks for the info.

Yes, you may have been stopped out, but you also would have had a winning trade immediately after that. (see pic below)

I want to thank sangmane for the fix as he did all the work on the original version of my box fibo indicator in my London Progressive thread, thanks again buddy, I owe you one. I've attached the fixed indicators and new templates to post #1.

xmph makes a valid point though, most breakout strategies are inherently simple which is great for anyone to use but are also known to lack on the performance side. Hopefully this can be addressed eventually.

Here is my analysis of last nights trading on;

Eur/Usd

Gbp/Usd

Usd/Jpy

Eur/Jpy

Usd/Chf

All pips totals I mention are before the spread.

First the Eur/Usd. We had one trade entry that just miss our target and is now in a range. I would wait til your near the start of the box around 04:00 GMT and close the trade whether in profit or not. I was hoping to see the gap filled by now, but it may still happen.

***Update***

After narrowly missing our target twice, Eur/Usd stay ranging for most of the night and I would've closed out at 04:00 GMT for +36 pips (see new pic)

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Textbook trade on the Gbp/Usd for roughly 55 pips.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Usd/Jpy was starting strong and died out just before hitting target. Now don't hesitate if you want to close the trade in profit, there's nothing wrong with that.

***Update***

Our initial trade was stopped out for -33 pips but we had a successful 2nd entry that just finish several hours ago for +25 pips. (see new pic)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Another solid trade on the Eur/Jpy for roughly +36 pips.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Usd/Chf hit the entry quick and then stalled, similar to Usd/Jpy. I'd give it til 03:00-04:00 then close out for a small loss if you have to.

***Update***

Usd/Chf did not breakout of it's range before 04:00 GMT so I would've closed out the trade at 04:00 GMT with a small 10 pip loss. (see new pic)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Wouldn't this strategy work perfectly fine without the fibonacci extensions?.Just enter on a breach of the high or the low of the box.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Yes I'm sure it probably could, but that's not what the thread is about. If you want to try it out that way, be my guest.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
My backtest showed me, that almost the whole time USD/CHF is doing the opposite of EUR/USD (as we know, there is a anti-correlation)... so wouldn't it be better to leave out USDCHF?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I think the concept with FIBs looks promising... nevertheless I changed your rules in two simple point...

One change is according to SL... I set my initialStopLoss in the middle of the box... Backtesting showed, that I will have only a few more losses but therefore smaller ones...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
lot of times they are retracing after touching our entry levels. would it be prident to wait for a retracement and enter at a better price instead of blindly placing orders as per system ? we could miss some good trades but overall it gives better RRR

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I'm just showing examples using the major pairs. It is up to the trader to pick which pairs works best for them.

Good, glad to see your making it work for your trading style, that's exactly what I like to see. Good luck and keep it up.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Okay, I think we really need to understand that this strategy is just a base for you to trade off of and not to be construed as the perfect way to trade. We can have 100 people come in here and nit pick thing thing apart all day long if we wanted to, but I hoping it doesn't get that way. Take it and modify it how ever you choose. If you feel the fib levels are too close, move the entry point farther out, that's why I included two indicators in post #1. That's the beauty of this, change it to fit how you trade. For me, personally, I have a large enough account to be able to martingale my lots after a losing trade to recoup my losses. Now I know not everyone is able to do that but the strategy(as exph tested out and stated earlier in the thread) is strong candidate for it, so I will test it out and hope it can be profitable. But that is just how I'll choose to trade it.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I read your thread over the weekend and tried it yesterday on my live account......I normally trade off intraday and daily fibs and adding this strategy did wonders to my own way of trading....for the time being I tried it on GBPUSD and EURJPY.....as those are the only pairs I trade normally......I will keep posting my views over the next few days while I test it out.....but for me this strategy is definitely a keeper thanks

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yesterday we got of to a winning start..JUST!

+16 pips on a sell order for EUR/GBP.

Orders are set for today, will update with results ASAP.

I think we might need to be mindful of S/R and pivot level, if these are close to our orders, might be worth adjusting orders so these are just inside/outside the order price etc.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Total simulated results from Monday:

Eur/Usd= +36 pips

Gbp/Usd= +55 pips

Usd/Jpy= -8 pips (+25-33)

Eur/Jpy= +36 pips

Usd Chf= -10 pips

______________________

Total= +109 pips (6 trades taken- 4 winners, 2 losers)

Again this is just how I see the trades happen. Now If I were to trade the way I really wanted to, I would have doubled up on the second Usd/Jpy trade (which would have made up for the initial loss) and would double up on the Usd/Chf trade for today.

Was this on your live account? If so, good job and keep us updated.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Please don't take offense, but I'd be extremely cautious of trading immediately on live account until it really has proven itself. Now I can't tell you not to, but if you are determined to trade live, please use extremely small lots until you are perfectly comfortable with it.

Can i just clarify this please? GMT is the time in London.

Frankfurt opens at 0700 GMT and London actually opens at 0800 GMT. The market hours do not change for DST!

If your TimeZone does not operate DST then you will need to adjust -1 hour from 28th March until 31st October. However if your timezone operates DST and you are in it then the Market hours are the same.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I just utilize the time shown in the market watch and compare it to the time that's on my trading clock that I use (www.qlock.com). If my market watch is 1 hour slower than my trading clock, then I would adjust my inputs accordingly.

A Quick answer for some quick bucks .... I already love you my man. (what's really wrong about the first indi? anyways)

mer071898, I have a six hour flight over the week-end. I'll try to code the martingale in the EA and release it through next week. It will be for discussion purpose and far from reliable for live trading (although I will probably live trade what I will post but I'm quite open to risk ;-) )

Xmph

--- 帖子 #74 ---
You are mistaken.

The NY, London and Frankfurt market hours do change for DST. (Europe calls it Summer Time)

During Summer Time, London time is GMT+1. That makes the London open at 0700 GMT- Which is 0800 London local time.

Frankfurt is GMT+2 during Summer Time.

That makes the Frankfurt open at 0600 GMT- Which is 0800 Frankfurt local time.

Here is a link that shows the current GMT.

If you are in England, compare your local time against GMT. You will find that your time is one hour ahead of GMT.

I believe there is a bug in the indicator. The first box ever drawn on  the first day of backtesting (not the repainted history boxes) contains  12 candles where every other one contains 13 candles. That changes the  entry and every other levels ... only on the first time ..... rest is  ok. (please my attached picture) - EA made 33 pips on that one due to the 12 candles box ... 13 candles would have made 36 as you said.

Anyhow, you said the box are drawn from
.... which means 12 candles in total ... why every other box (but the first one) is a 13  candles box? Am I understanding something incorrectly or reading the box/chart incorrectly ? Each of your charts show  13 candles boxes, until 7.15am GMT.

Finally, I realize you have a huge spike on Eur/JPY ... what is your broker? I don't have this on mine (see attached chart again).

Please, could you post few other charts as this help me verify that the EA is performing well (meaning accordingly), that there is no time issue and so on.

regards,

I don't know what you mean by not being correct? All pics I have posted are using the first London Breakout indicator. After sangmane made the fix, I also made the adjustments to the first indicator as well and re-posted the correct indicators and templates in post #1. You may want to re-install the indicators and templates again.

billbss, I guess there is a little confusion on the time. Looking at the first pic below, the right side (from your link) shows us a GMT time of roughly 1:51 am. My broker's market watch time is roughly 2:51 am which indicates I'm at GMT +1. So in order for us the have the box correctly end at the Frankfurt open we would need to change the time from 03:00 to 06:00 instead of 04:00 to 07:00, correct? I just want to be clear so I don't mislead anyone and that we provide the correct information to those who follow the thread.(see pic 1)

You may want to recount the candles in the first box in your pic. I zoomed in on the date you saw 12 candles and I still counted 13. (see pic 2)

In order for the box to be drawn on the 07:00 candle you must include the price action of the whole candle which goes to 07:15. If you want the box to only include price action up to 07:00, you must change the time to 06:45. But then the end of the box will be drawn at the 06:45 candle instead. That's why you get the 13th candle in the box, because your including the additional price action of the last candle to the mix.

It's probably just the difference in the price feed.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I hate to put the thread in a holding pattern, but I will be holding off on posting my analysis until billbss can confirm the correct times we need in the indicator.

I would rather wait and provide everyone with the correct settings than to mislead anyone and have too much confusion on the subject, thanks for the patience.

I agree, from the screenshot, your broker's time is set for GMT+1.

Frankfurt opens at 06:00 GMT. That is 07:00 on your chart.

Your box should end at the 06:45 (15M) bar. The 06:45 bar ends at the last tick before 0700. If you set it to include the 07:00 bar, the box would actually end at 07:15.

If it is 3 hours long, it should begin at 04:00.

I hope this made sense.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Well, that definitely clarifies the time, thanks. Everyone will need to base the indicator's start and end times on GMT +0 which would translate to 03:00 to 06:00 GMT. I personally will keep my time at 04:00 to 07:00 since I'm at GMT +1 on my broker and I've already posted results using these times. If you want to set your end time 1 bar earlier, I'll leave it up to the discretion of the trader.

I will also start analyzing the trades with and without martingale lot sizing. The martingale sizing will start after the first loss. The multiplier is calculated to make sure you will end up recouping any losses on all your previous losses. Once a profitable trade is made you will go back to the original lot size you've decided to use. Remember, martingale strategies are inherently risky and should not be used unless adequate capital is available.

The lot multiplier I will be using after each loss will start as follows:

after 1st loss- X 2
after 2st loss- X 5
after 3st loss- X 13
after 4st loss- X 34
after 5st loss- X 89
after 6st loss- X 233
after 7st loss- X 610

So if you start with .01 lots and you incurred 7 losses, you would trade using .02, .05, .13, .34, .89, 2.33, and 6.1 lots respectively. Because everyone will be using various lot sizes, I will be multiply the pip totals by the multiplier. It may seem confusing but you'll visually see how it will work when I put it in my posts.

Okay, now that we're back in business, here is my rundown of Tuesdays trades.

Eur/Usd was ranging really bad resulting in 4 losses of -45 pips each before hitting our target for +34 pips.

No Martingale

-45

-45

-45

-45
+34 =
-146 pips

With Martingale Multiplier

-45

-90 (-45 x 2)

-225 (-45 x 5)

-585 (45 x 13)
+1156 (+34 x 34) =
+211 pips

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Gbp/Usd had a box size over 50 pips so a "No Trade" recommendation is given.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Usd/Jpy had two standard trades @ 25 pips each for a total of +50 pips.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Eur/Jpy was a borderline trade as the box was right at 50 pips. You could had went either way on this one. Since it was at and not over 50 pips, I would've taken the trades. Two more standard trades were made for 50 pips each for a total of +100 pips.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Usd/Chf was range bound as well with 1 losing trade of -35 pips and 1 winner for +27 pips.

No Martingale

-35
+27 =
-8 pips

With Martingale Multiplier

-35
+54 (+27 x 2)

+19 pips

--- 帖子 #86 ---
So as we can see with no martingale multipliers used we ended up with an overall loss of:

-146
+50
+100
-8     =
-4 pips

But with the martingale multiplier in effect we have this:

+211

+50

+100
+19   =

+380 pips

It sounds as if you're developing a variation on the Big Ben Breakout,
which is covered in an article entitled
"Day Trading the FX Market: A Different Approach to the Pound"
by Kristian Kerr. (Google Search for a .pdf copy).

This is the chart from that article (from the Sept 2004 issue of
Currency Trader magazine) which gives you an idea of which
currencies suddenly pick up speed starting with the London open:

Hello mer071898,

Did you check such a Martingale on Eur/Jpy round January ... an account blower for some ... high risk for others ... I'm not sure Martingale only would do without trying to include some market trending indicator (I know we try to avoid indi here, and I'm for KISS, but who knows 2-3 EMAs are not that bad).

Furthermore, I'm trying Martingale, but by adjusting the nb of lots with the Take Profit on the fibs (I mean .. let's use these TakeProfit to our advantage), and eventually by conserving a 2% risk for each trade not martingaled and deciding about the number of lots to martingale if necessary based on some little market action indi.

I like your breakout strategy and the fibs target. KISS makes me happy. I will just input a little of what I do in my other strategies to investigate if it may contribute positively to your strategy.

Thanks for posting more charts. This is helpful. Do you have any other criteria for reversal ?

Thanks for that. I realize there were also other thread about this on FF and I will check 'em.

XmPh.

C'mon now guys, are we that lazy to take a whole 5 seconds to use your crosshair tool to get the box size, really?

nightyhawk, I tried both of the modified indicators you posted but nothing shows up when placed on a chart. (see pic)

Seems you are using a 5digit broker... hmmm eventually you should extend the parameter MaxBarSize to 300...?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I'm sorry I just don't see where January was a bad month. Profit targets were hit over half of the time and I only saw, at the most, 3 losses in a row. But as I said several times now, martingale strategies are not designed for those who do not have the capital or account equity to back up the trades that are taken.

I have an account size where if I started with .01 lots I could feasibly go 12 losses in a row and not be margin called and I've never seen it go half that far yet. Will it eventually have 8, 9, maybe 10 to 11 losses in a row, maybe, but that would be an extremely rare instance. A pair would have to range for the whole week without a spike or news event or just plain lousy price action to get that far and I have yet to see that happen.

With regards to reversal, no I really have no criteria for them. Best thing to do is watch the chart and see how the price reverses at certain levels and then we'll have to look at adjusting the entry point more, but that will come later.

If you've bothered to read the WHOLE thread, I have already mention the risk of martingale techniques several times. No one is forcing anyone to use a martingale style of trading in this thread.

This strategy was not designed for higher timeframes.

I have been using the original indicators with no issues, but it now works, thanks.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
This is cause I changed the indicator to hide boxes which are wider than the specified size (default the box should not extend 50Pips).

4digit broker 10pip distance = 1.4410 - 1.4420

5digit broker 10pip distance = 1.44100 - 1.44110 (so only Pip for real)!

Is there any way to modify the code to make it automatically work with both a 4 or 5 digit broker without having to change the input and add a 0?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
hawk, with this formula
PHP Code      double myPoint = MathPow(10, -1*Digits);

,

you just get back the Point variable.

This code will do the trick:
PHP Code  double myPoint = Point;
if(Digits==3 || Digits==5) myPoint = 10*Point;

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Then we both agree .... 3 losses in a row and having to martingale at
, and if that happens on two pairs .... that is martingale at x26 .... blindly ... No matter the account size, this is a lack of money management from my point of view.

Now, I don't want to discuss this further and will let everyone do as they feel comfortable.

X.

PS: My line of thinking is: Make the most of what you get (in terms of price action), not what you can (in terms of account size and risk exposure).

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Your view of Money Management will differ from everyone else, so if you don't like to martingale your trades, then by all means don't. Yes, you can and will run into this situation, but remember, a smart trader will have enough capital and equity to cover a worst case scenario on all the pairs he/she may trade, not just one. I think most traders wouldn't be stupid enough to properly fund an account that would sustain one pair, then try to trade 10 different pairs on the same account. That would just lack common sense.

Then what should be the box time? 02GMT-05GMT or 04GMT-07GMT?

Depends on your broker's time. If you are on GMT +0 then it's 03:00 to 06:00. Or if your at GMT +3, then you'd put in 06:00 to 09:00. Just compare your Market Watch time to the actual GMT time here.

one suggestion about logging the trade status with pips. some trades give more pips and some less. right way to do is calculate number of winners and losers. i bet same risk on EACH trade. doesnt matter how many pips i get, lose. i lose 100$ or gain 73$, if i win 10 trades and lose 4 trades, i can calculte how many $ i made

overall this has been a profitable week and today i hit 3 targets within 2 bars of entry

Where it says "Entry" there you take the position where it says, "Profit Target" that is your TP and on the other end of the box is your SL. Everything is written on the chart!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
It definitely looks better.

How far did you backrest ?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I did not back test it but If I look in the past chart, the strategy shows more profits than looses. So you can see yourself! Its easy to estimate.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Great results, but if you can do me a favor and please post result in the Trading Journals section. Since you are using the other indicator and different timeframe, I don't want everyone else to get confused, thanks.

That's the whole reason I do pips is because everyone uses different lot sizes. I do the same thing except with pips, it doesn't matter how many winners or losers I have, it's if I'm + or - in the pips overall that matter. I also do pips to explain the martingale sequences, and that doesn't translate as well with dollars. When I post my results with "No martingale", that is done assuming the same lot size for each trade, win or lose.

The only difference between the two is the entry point on London Breakout 1 is just past the 27 fib extension @30. On London Breakout 2, the entry point is just beyond the 38.2 fib extension @42. Keep in mind kijkij is also using it on a 1 hour timeframe which is not what the thread is based on.

Thanks kijkij, you beat me to it. Everything is written directly on the indicator for you already.

That why I said to play around and find out what works for you. But again, I stress to please post all of your results in the trading Journal section so not to clutter up the thread and to confuse other traders.

***Just a small note, I have updated the two indicators and templates in post #1 with the changes in the code that nightyhawk has made which included the MaxBoxSize parameter and the ability to change the level color. The Fibcolor input parameter was removed as I saw no changes when the input was changed. If you are using a 5 digit broker, please add an extra "0" to get the correct MaxBarSize.***

I could not resist this, so I have spent a happy few hours adapting my BS Asian Session Breakout robot to this system.

To save myself some typing, can I ask people to go to my Boris Schlossberg thread at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=216557 and download the user guide if there are any inputs in this robot you cannot understand.

For those of you unfamiliar with my work, I like to write multi-pair auto-trading robots. This one is one of these. Also, there are a couple of personal characteristics you need to understand: i code input times in your computer's local time, and the defaults are what work for me. You have to enter your LondonStartTime in your own local time. I code anything that requires a pip setting 5 digit format, then the robot automatically divides the figure by 10 if yours is a 4 digit criminal. If yours is a 4 digit criminal, then your mental setting of 50 for MaxTradingPipsFromHiLo (the maximum box size you will allow the robot to trade) by 10, so it becomes 500. The on-screen display shows some slightly different figures to those shown by the indicator. I cannot work out why, but the differences do not look significant to me.

Users might want to keep their usual charts open with the indicator running, to check that the figures the robot is using are more-or-less correct. Shout out if there is anything wildly different.

Important note: I have not sorted out the logic that allows the robot to be loaded at any old time and still work out which are the correct candles to get the box hi-lo from. This means you need to load it up before the start of the European session tomorrow, and make sure it is running when your LondonOpens hour arrives.

Cheers guys. Have fun. I am looking forward to trying out this baby.

Especial cheers to mer071898, without whom none of this would be happening.

Wow,

SteveHopwood came to this nice thread... I'm deeply impressed

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Pure accident, but a happy one. Glad to be here.

By the by guys, I meant to say. Once I put source code up I regard it as 'open source'. Coders please feel free to adapt it and put up said adaptations here. We can all benefit.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
why shld magic number be more than 5 digits?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
If you've ever needed a trade management EA, his is the one you should use. I knew it wouldn't be too long before someone would pop in with an EA for this. Thank you Steve for your contribution, and thank you for the voucher. It means a lot coming from a well respected FF member.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Mr. Simple, see this is almost same as your system？ except your FIB tp.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
My pleasure. People able to come up with such a simple and helpful system deserve to have their expertise recognised.

I am looking forward to trading this tomorrow and next week.

Hehe. This probably means your system has taken its last profitable trade.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Firstly, my regards and thanks to Mer for the system.

I put in my 1 cent here.  it is one cent to you guys, but like a thought after many days and nights efforts on my end.

Mathematically, Martingale expand the risk expontienally, but without increasing reward (expectancy).

To overcome the risk while still having chance to go for next win (to offset previous loss), try this:

position size: 1 -> 1 -> 2.

usually, martingale is 1 -> 2 -> 4, this is too risky.

i'm lazy and forgetful to write about the reduction of the % to margin call using my 1:1:2 way compared to usual 1:2:4.  Let's say, if you trade a system and have 100% probability to bankrupt using 1:2:4, using my way will make you 70% likely to go bankrupt.

also, i am not suggesting 1:1:2:4:8 till margin call.

i am suggesting 1:1:2 (or at most 1:1:2:5) intraday, if all loss, then that's it for the day--bad luck, next day will be a new start from 1 again.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
To encourage people to use diverse magic numbers in an attempt to hide from the criminals the fact that a number of traders are using the same trading robot.

Experienced traders/coders: know how to get around this; understand why they should not do so. This function is aimed at attempting some protection for the rest.

My own live trading magic numbers are never less than 8 digits long.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Steve,

Does this EA does the re-entry thing as mer posted in post # 43? I don't see such option in the inout tab. If yes, it would be good if can specify number of re-entry.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
For those of you interested purely in manually trading this system, I attach a script that will send the trades for you.

You set the lot size, then the pending price, stop and tp for both trades. Save the details as a setfile before attempting to send the trades, so you do not have to retype the details following a send failure.

If either of the trade sends fail, the script will notify you and invite you to try again. It will detect either of the pairs as a successful send and only try to resend the unsuccessful one.

The MagicNumber defaults to that used by mptm for those of you who wish to use this to manage the trades.

mer071898, this is merely a variant of a script that I have used many times. It will not need updating. Please feel free to hijack it and add it to the downloads in post 1 so it is easy to find.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
This ea will automatically enter pending trades whenever the price is within the box. There is no limit on the number of re-entries. Would you like one?

What makes more sense to me is something that Boris Schlossberg says, I think in regard to his 10 a day system. I cannot remember exactly what, but he says along the lines that: "when 3 trades have all lost then there must be something going on in the markets that I do not know about, so I step away until for a few hours."

So, maybe a maximum number of losers per session instead? With a bit of thought, I can code both a max trades per session and a max losers per session. What do you guys think?

My instinct is to leave things as they are for now, and see what happens to avoid over-complicating things.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Just to let everyone know, I noticed that Ronald Raygun was reading here earlier.

Everybody who has been a member of FF for more than a couple of days knows that RR is the master of EA coding. I pm'd him for some code to allow my robot to look back to the correct time whenever it is loaded.

He has been kind enough to send me the code that I need. I will try to have this up and running by Sunday night (or Monday if you live in those parts of the world where you have to stand upside down all the time).

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Steve,

All values show 0. Am I missing the indi?

Vinesh

--- 帖子 #142 ---
The robot does not need the indi. The values will read zero until your platform receives a tick. It has probably done so before I can post this reply.

Mind, you should have the indi as well. It is fantastic.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Nope it didn't.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Attached. I have both indis in my folder.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Looks good to me now.

Thanks very much, Steve.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Sorry Vinesh. I simply have no idea why your robot is refusing to cooperate.

Try shutting everything down and starting again. More than that, I am at a loss to suggest.

I hope you get this sorted out.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Tried everything. No can do. Thanks anyway.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
No, "mer071898", I am not using any other indicator and any TF except 15Min as you instructed. I am using your indicator with 15TF. the purpose to show the progress is just that your strategy can be profitable if we do good risk management. Sorry if you mind it.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
The whole concept of the martingale is to recoup  your losses and provide you a winning end result. I'm going to respond to this visually. I will take, from post #81, the TP of +34 pips and the SL of -45 pips an compare your 1-1-2  to my 1-2-5.

Your Suggested Martingale

-45

-45 (-45 x 1)
+68 (+34 x 2) =
-22 pips

My Suggested Martingale

-45

-90 (-45 x 2)
+170 (+34 x 5) =
+35 pips

As you can see my martingale recoups all my losses plus a little profit in my pocket, yours does not. Even if you went to 2.5 as you mentioned you'd still end up with -5 pips. I've learned this way of doing martingale trading since I developed my PowerSM EA and have been using martingale strategies for 5-6 years now (without blowing an account and going in to bankruptcy). I'm even working with another trader in developing an Semi-Martingale based EA for Institutional traders which can safely double your money in a year with a properly funded account (If anyone wants to see the backtests I will be more than happy to show them to you).

Now, please don't construe this as I'm saying your wrong or I'm just picking on you, because that's not it. All I'm saying is it's a matter of opinion and my opinion is if your going to martingale your trades you should be profitable overall on the winner when it hits.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks for the script Steve, the more tools the better.

The problem I see here Steve is when a Profit Target is hit and we look for additional trades, sometimes price will only retrace back to the entry point and not reach the box. This would still qualify as a re-entry trade (see pic). When we're below the box, the EA should only initiate short trades once price touches our entry point and when above we're above the box, the EA should only initiate long trades once price touches our  entry point.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks for you strategy. Works good.

Yesterday 7 trades(1 Long and 6 short) made me +218 pips. But here is a question that what if we go only oneway! I mean if after the box popup and we place two trades(Long Stop, Short Stop) and one of them hit so should we close the other pending order) In this way will it be still profitable from your experience?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Steve, I think it would definitely ease the minds of those traders who want the option of limiting their exposure. I would love to see a true/false option to allow you to martingale your lots as well, but I'm just wishful thinking. If you need more info on the times and trade specifics Steve, just e-mail me and I can go into more detail without cluttering up the thread.

One problem I see vinesh is your trying to run this on a 1 hour chart in which the strategy is not designed for. It is meant to be on a 15 minute timeframe.

Sorry when you ask in post# 96,

"Is it possible to fix the Fibo line lengths so that it should remain in  the period separator area? For larger TF they are mixing with each  other!"

You implied in your statement that you were using it on higher timeframes, my apologies.

First off I don't use pending orders in my manual trading, but that's just me. The reason why, and especially in this strategy, is that you can have 2-4 short trades in a row like we had on the Eur/Usd. Unless your sitting there at your computer, you can't automatically place another pending order once it's triggered to take advantage of other trade in that direction. Hopefully the EA Steve is working on will take care of that for us.

If you have a long and short pending order you should keep both active as we all know price can reverse on you and shoot straight to your other Profit Target without warning like in the pic I attached.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
The reason for that question was when I switched to higher TF with your indi, the fibo lines were mixing with each other and I wanted a clean chart with out removing your indicator.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
No harm, no foul. Just remember, the lines are based on the number of bars and not the size of the chart. As you go higher or lower in the timeframe you'll always have to adjust the length of the lines.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I tried 15 minute chart too.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Chart attached.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I can't explain what the problem would be vinesh, you'll have to be patient and see what Steve comes up with, sorry.

Alright, here we go for Thursday's trades. A great night as every pair was a winner with no losing trades. The will be no need to show the martingale multiplier since there was no losing trades. Since we did have some multipliers carried over, let's see how they unfolded.

Eur/Usd had one winning trade for +24 pips. As we finished off last night's trading with two losses, we have a multiplier of 5 added to the equation which gives us a grand total of +120 pips.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Gbp/Usd had 3 winning trades for +26 pips each.This was the only pair not to end with a losing trade last night so all we end up with is +78 pips since we don't need the multiplier. Tough to stomach, I know.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Usd/Jpy had one winning trade last night for +26 pips and it took all day to get there. As we finished off last night's trading with 1  loss, we have a multiplier of 2 added to the equation which  gives us a grand total of +52 pips.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Eur/Jpy was the big winner of the night, but not because of the pip total of +48 pips, but the multiplier of 34 we get to use after the dismal performance of 4 losses last night. This gives us a whopping total of +1632 pips!!!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Usd comes trailing in last with a ho-hum +18 pips and we only get to use a multiplier of 2 because of the late partial loss last night. That gives us a total +36 pips.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
So, not a bad night if I do say so myself:

With no martingale  multipliers used  we ended up with an overall profit of:

+24
+78
+26

+48
+18 =
+194 pips

With the martingale multiplier in effect from last nights trades we have   this:

+120

+78

+52

+1632
+36   =
+1918 pips

As you can see we made up the -59 pip loss and the -271 pip loss w/multiplier very easily. But not every night will go this smoothly though.

Remember that the market closes early on Fridays, so make sure to limit the trades you take and I highly suggest to try and not carry trades over the weekend so not to get caught in a gap up or down on Sunday.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi,

Am also facing the same problem. All are reading 0....  Using Alpari UK demo account.

Please help.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #164 ---
You just have to be patient guys, this EA Steve has modified is not specifically designed for this strategy. He has tweaked from his Asian breakout. I'm sure Steve will chime in and hopefully produce some answers for everyone.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
please use the london breakout 2 indicator in post #1.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
i'm confused as to which of the indicators i should use. is the first one on post# 1 still okay or the modified one?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Depends on what you want... if you just want to play with the indicator, take the one from the first post.

Following ones were improved and bugfixed (some bugs which were made while improving)

--- 帖子 #168 ---
thanks for the prompt reply

--- 帖子 #169 ---
like GU is on it's way back up for about 80 pips...and GJ for about 120pips from here....might be wrong!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
No he won't. Sorry guys; I have no idea why some values are reading zero. Mine is also running on an Alpari UK demo. It is hard to fix a fault that is not appearing at my end.

One suggestion is this. Alpari are beggars for disconnecting their demos, sometimes for quite long periods. On load up, the robot instantly displays the feedback screen; if the demo is disconnected, the robot has no data to work with and so displays zero values.

Try using the attached to generate ticks and see if this fixes the problem. I have no other ideas to offer.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Alpari UK live has the same problem here... all values show 0 and no pending trades set.

Trying to check the code... maybe I find something

--- 帖子 #172 ---
In order to get the EA working you need to set the time of London (or Frankfurt) open in your local time equivalent. I am normally at GMT -8 and London is normally at GMT+0; in other words London is 8 hrs ahead of me. this holds true for standard and day-light saving time; with the exeption of a couple weeks before the start and end of day-light saving time because when George W Bush was president of USA he extended the period when day-light saving time was to be in effect and the rest of the world with the exception of Canada did not follow along. So, for me 8:00 am London open is 12:00 midnight or 0 hr. (See EA info on G/U chart.)

Also, the high and the low of the box calculated by the EA is different from that calculated by the indicator in post 1. See E/U chart. Although the difference is not very much, the entry price difference are significant.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
oh! i love this strategy for it's re-entry confirmations...GU actually went up 80 pips but I was able to get 66 from it...the original TP was hit earlier

good trade

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thanks to the incomparable Ronald Raygun who supplied the code, the robot will now pick up the extent of the most recent box whenever we load it onto are charts. The values displayed are also more accurate.

I have added code to spot re-entry opportunities. At the moment, this is a bit of a blunt instrument, in that it sends a pending trade at PendingPipsDistanceOnReEntry away from market as soon as the price retraces within the Entry prices and the extent of the box. I opted for pending rather market trades to give the retrace room to continue if this is going to happen.

We might want to change this to closer to the extent of the box. Let's try it and see.

Sing out if any bugs appear.

Enhancements coming up are: a Martingale option an input to allow users to limit the number of trades per pair per day

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Great stuff... working now like a charm... tx Steve and Ronald...

hours ago I setup buy/sell stops/limits for EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY.. I believed in this strategy..

All trades are losers except for USDJPY. Lost total of 120pips or more..

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I am using template 2 and see no loss on EURUSD...1st trade in USDJPY was a loss and 2nd was good.. GBPUSD was a loss and no second trade

--- 帖子 #182 ---
that's because you're trading with a different trigger point due to different fibo's setting of template 2! try to load the template1 and you'll see the difference.... sometimes is better the first (earlier entry and tp) sometimes the second.....

this is forex isn't it?

Accounting for the spread is a little less ... or you would not have make it through but excellent trades and strategy for the day anyways.

Accounting for the spread in an EA, I now have multiple re-entry  and made 23.2pips each, considering you have to make a choice and whether placing an entry at Bid=TragetProfit(not losing the spread) or at Ask=ProfitTraget(losing the spread) (speaking of a short of course) ... but no way you have have get the whole thing (26pips).

Would you really re-enter even if the price action did not touch the low side of the Box, meaning do you re-enter on a bounce (such as the third entry)? is it is safer to enter only if price action went a little above the entry level like the second entry on my pics (I'm asking based on your experience, without accounting for the backtesting I did ;-) to have a better feel of you playing with the strategy based on your forward experience) ?

I'm now looking at the Martingale.

My Eur/Jpy was over 50 pips and the indicator did not place a box, are you using the updated indicators in post#1?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I don't know if it's a different feed from the broker or if your using the  London Breakout 2, but my Eur/Usd was a good trade and my box was over  50 pips on the Gbp/Usd

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yes I am using the updated one...I change the setting so they show up.  I know if the box is larger then 50 pips then we could have a range day but I play it accordingly.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I started using a directional approach trading the London open and opening the trade instantly if I observe the signal on my chart.

Let's say you enter a limit orders 20p above/below the current price vs. doing instant execution and that pair falls more than 19p, and you get filled on your limit sell.

Compare this to as if you used a directional approach using a MA, or other indicator (it doesn't matter) and the signal was short and you entered the trade immediately and used a 20p stop - you are ahead 20p at the beginning vs. using limit orders.

I realize the pair may instead go the other direction, but if it did, you would be stopped out for a 20p loss - the same pip difference from using limit orders vs. instant exectution. Besides, even more than 20p could be lost if the pair whipsaws if using limit orders, unless you're able to close out unfilled trade or if you have OCO capability.

For example:

Using limit orders:

1) e/u is at 1.3500 at beginning of London session.

2) You set limit orders 20p above/below 1.3500.

3) Assume pair goes below 1.3480 and continues moving down.

4) Say you close the trade at 1.3400, then your profit is 80p.

Using instant execution:

1) e/u is at 1.3500 at beginning of London session.

2) You enter market immediately and set 20p stop.

3) Say you close the trade at 1.3400, then your profit is 100p.

If you're using the instant execution method and the pair happens to move in the other direction and doesn't reverse, don't chase it - just wait for another opportunity during the next session. For those of you who are thinking, "well, if the limit order makes 80p, but the other guy that entered a market order lost 20p because the pair moved in a different direction than his signal", my response is, that may happen sometimes, but I still believe using market orders will be more profitable in the long run.

The examples above do not factor in the spread.

Attached is a chart of e/u trade I entered this morning at beginning of London session: 175p.

Okay, this is how I ended up the week:

Eur/Usd, for me, ended with one winning trade for +35 pips. We have no multipliers in effect

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Usd/Jpy ended up with two losses of -29 pips each and two winners of +22 pips each.

No Martingale

-29

+22

-29

+22 =
-14 pips

With Martingale Multiplier

-29

+44 (+22 x 2)

-29
+44(+22 x 2) =
+30 pips

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Usd/Chf had the initial trade stopped out for a -33 pip loss and a winning trade for +15 pips. I closed this trade early as I don't keep trades past 17:00 GMT on Friday.

No Martingale

-33

+15 =
-18 pips

With Martingale Multiplier

-33
+30 (+15 x 2) =
-3 pips

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Both my Gbp/Usd and Eur/Jpy boxes were over 50 pips so no trades were taken.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
That is why this is a different thread. I'm not going to bring something from a different thread to use here. If you want to use the levels in the London Progressive Strategy, be my guest, but keep it in that particular thread.

As I mentioned yesterday, holding trades over the weekend make your trades very susceptible to gaps in the market when the market opens back up on Sunday. If your a long term trader where trades last several days to several weeks or months, that's okay, but not if your scalping or trading intraday.

That's always a good suggestion, but there is still good market movement in the early morning hours but it usually dies off quickly after London session closes at 17:00 GMT.

Honestly, you can use this on any pair. It is highly suggested to use pairs with lower spreads. It wouldn't make sense to trade pairs with a huge spread as most of your profits get eaten up by the spread itself because you will generally deal with boxes less than 50 pips. You can always experiment and demo trade to find the best pair for trading.

Again, I already stated earlier in the thread that my results are not including the spreads. Since the .mq4 files are attached, anyone can adjust the profit Target fib level closer to your entry if that helps you with spread issues.

Dear mer071898

First off all, I would like to thank you for this Indicator... You are the Man!

Wish you live around  in neighborhod.. so I can buy you drink and give you a proper thanks.

Actually I registered to this forum with only one purpose. To say thank you to mer071898

Since I am familiar with another London breakout system, I didn't bother to test it in demo account. Goin straight to live and I've found out Your indicator works better....

I downloaded in April 14 and start trading with it same day in afternoon. It earn me more than 300 pips with FXpro for 3 days....

Of course I made adjustment to the indicator to suit my trading style.

I wanna share my setting with you guys so everybody here can enjoy (and maybe got  rich):

Here is:

1. My broker is FXPro and if I am not mistaken its in GMT 2 at the moment.

2. Change start Time to 07:00 End Time to 10:00

3. Adding MT4 standard Stochastic (10:3:3)

4. Adding MT4 Standard Deviation (20)

5. Adding free #AutoTrendChannel indicator. ( I can not redistribute it, you guys should ask Google to download this indicator. Just put the Bold word to Google.

I Found that The #AutoTrendChannel and your London Breakout work like wonder for me. I can figure out more easily where the Curve will go or not go. Just keep in mind that It will only show us the aproximately. Like ussual, The trend line will break on top and low. That's where Stoch and STDev come in handy.

Only put your TP inside the trendline. Most time you'll be safe and will earn pips. If the Autotrend  line is too far away from the furthest Fibo Profit target, most time it will not go there. Just play safe and Forget it.

I tried not to put my order directly since to much emotion in it and just go with buy-sell stop. Yes, my friend...we are trapping real money here....

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I hope I make my self clear enough. As you can see in my M15, I managed to trap the curve back and forth about 3 times in my last GBPJPY trade with this method. It earn me more than 100 Pips straight last time with GBPJPY... and I have Another trade like this in different pair.

With this method you dont have to put stops order to both side.. (Sometimes its too risky). Just put Stop Order if you predict the curve will swing that way. Learn the swing.

Just to make it simple, I will write you down some simple rules:

1. Go with the trend. Concentrate only on trendline.

2. Put Stop order only inside the trendline. Keep TP updated

3. Use Stochastic to figure out when the curve will change direction.

4. Use STD Dev to read how fast and far the Price will move, After london open, if STD Dev is pointing up mostly the price will jump. Together with Stoch they can be used to predict how far the trendline will be broken and where the bounce back will occur. Then Set your trap.

5. If you are not sure, divide your trap into smaller pieces and spread them in 10-15 pips away in front of the curve swing. Dont get too close. Let the candle breathe. Put 10-15 pips separation in between traps. So when the curve is  bouncing, you are not risking more trade. Especially when the curve approaching area near middle dot-line in trendline indicator. In fact, do not make a trap that cross the middle dot line, you never know the curve will cross, bounce or stay stuck there. Stay away. Divide the traps. Be safe.

6. Don get greed.   I always choose to securing smaller profits and then starting a new trap after rather than risking more with longer trade.

7. Dont get itchy finger and jumpy to start the trade directly and right away after the box is showed up. Even if the first candle is already touch one of the Fibo lines. I lost 30 pips when did this. Be calm. Read the trendline carefully and make your prediction. Wait for the candle comes into your predicted area then set your trap.

8. You can set your trap and go away but you can also maximize your earning if you check out the trade progress regularly and put another trap after the curve is bounced back by trend line.

9. I dont see the reason we can not trade some pair with this method. I think it will work with any pair (but have to check further on this). Just adjust the start time for the London box to put more curve into profitable area and you are set to go. GBPJPY is surely big earner for me. It jumps!

11. The way the curve bounces inside the trend line will tell you where it will go right from the start. Just follow the swing. Watchout for sudden trend reversal. Cancel the risky traps accordingly and put the new one in along within the trend line. That's why I favor traps. You have better chance to cancel traps whenever things become too risky without losing money. Cant do that with direct trade execution. Better to lose the predicted profit than losing your current money

12. You can minimize the risk of losing trade. Because Like I said...you can predict the swing path of the curve inside the trendline right from the start.

Here's the way how I divided my trap based the Curve swing on inside the Trend Line. It's AUDUSD, M15

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

(There is a small dot blue line right in the middle of the #AutoTrendChannel indicator. Maybe you can not see it in picture.)

I know it's only three days in live, have to run it in longer time to see how it will perform. But with the ease of use, safety and the fact that it brings gold for me more than usual, I can say right now that this method is surely a winner for me and yeah....I am happy.

Again, BIG THANKS to mer071898 for sharing this wonderful indicator

Any further inputs to improve is very welcome.

GIve it a try.. It's easy.

PS:

I am not a programer so I cant code. If you can make another box right next the blue box (on the right, of course). That would be fantastic. Make it in another color like yellow or something. It's for the safe zone mark to start setting up trade stop. After small observation, for me It's safer to wait 1-3 candle showed up then put the traps. That's where the new box I wanted to be.

For Wayank in Indonesia. Try this one bro... Knowledge is for share. God and People love you when you do that.

niceguy,

autotrendchannel is a linear regression channel. it repaints its channel to fit price curve. thats why your chart shows a perfect bounce at the upper/lower channel.

your rules is interesting, especially the addition of stoch and stdev to avoid loosing trade. but too many rules will make this strategy a complex london breakout.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
niceguy, I also think you have a great concept., but I have to agree with sangmane, if we start adding more and more indicators to this it becomes way to complex. Secondly, I am trying to become less and less reliant on charts full of indicators mainly because of their lagging nature in relation to the current price. By all means though, you should start up a new thread and explore this more and I'm sure if it is as successful as you have been in the past few days, you'll have a strong following and even more ideas will come your way for improving your strategy.

I'll tell you the best thing to do is run this on a trading simulator and you can see how this strategy has worked in the past and you can see how the trend channel reacts over time. The one I use was given to me by Ronald Raygun and is fantastic. I've attached it for you to try out if you'd like.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Well

I know the AutotrendChannel is always repaint to fit the curve. But it's also "always" bounce the curve to other side no matter how far it breaks. I even mentioned it in my post.

That's why I said to stay away when there is a chance of curve hitting the autochanel line. Wait for the rebound and see the STD Dev to predict how strong it will rebound.

Trap the curve in the the way between Top-Middle-Low and set the TP inside the trend channel when they are moving through London's Fibo.

I know it seems to be hard with so many rules.

Just give it a try in demo, learn how they bounce back. It's simple actually... at least for past three days.

When the curve hit Autotrend it will bounce, if they cross the middle it will after the Top and low extreme. If they bounce in the middle. Stay away... and put your trap in other side.

If it keep bouncing on the middle the trap is not being activate. But if it's gets through.. the trap is there to greet the curve. Make a small trap (relative to London's Fibo), so it wont take long to hit TP.

Just trap them in the way...

I set my trap around 2 hour from the next  (or so) and leave it away.

Works for me in 3 straight days....  But you were right... I always open for new idea and need to test it further.

Many thanks for the input...

Happy trading.

Here's My actual trading with USD CHF

I repaint the middle line with yellow so you gus can see.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I only managed to figure out 3  similar Traps for this one. Earn me only about 30 Pips total. But hey... It's profit.

FYI, I trade these three trades above at the same time last night. As you can see, I put the last trap in a risk (but it hits), I miss judge the curve, It bounces back In the Middle of trend line before finally hit the low ground.

This because it's near morning already. I woke up to take a piss, take a drink and put the last trap and went back to bed. ......And Smile when I wake up.

I dont see why it's not simple. Just put your trap on otherside of yellow line. Use the fibo and trend channel to help you reading the pattern.

You just put the Stop where the curve might go.

It's also suprised me that it hits almost all the time.

The only logic I know behind this is:
I didn't put all the traps at the same time. I waited one closed or I closed it and follow with other. (Some will take 2 hour some is more. ) So I always using the updated trend line whenever I put on a Trap.

I am not an expert on EA nor math expert.  I am a graphic Designer and just simply trading the pattern created by the trendline in conjuction with Londons Fibo.

That's all.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hello mer*, my comment was for whether or not a trade could actually be one, specifically for the case of programming an EA. Whether you account or not for the spread in the overall win/loss is one thing, but whether the spread is actually what makes a trade a winner (buying a short) is actually a little more you would agree (or not, whatever).

Anyhow, I feel a little reticence here and that will be my last post. Wish you the best. I will keep reading your thread and the strategy evolution as I think it's good but I will prevent from adding or commenting as you already said it all.

Best of all.

XmPh

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I'm not saying that your wrong by any means or you don't have a right to express your opinion, I am just letting people know that if they feel the need to change the indicator to accommodate the spread issue that they are more than welcome to change it to suit them.  Trust me, I'm open to any an all suggestions, but you understand, I have to keep control of the thread and try and keep to the basic points and everyone can go from there. I'm not here to babysit anyone, everyone here is an adult and is capable of doing a little exploring on their own.

sorry for stupid question from NB,

I really appreciate your kindhelp.

Thank you for your nice system

Here is the latest version of my robot. If you used it on demo on Friday, load up the history for the day and run the bot. You will see the display of the running totals pair by pair.

There is a new input - MaxTradesAllowedForTheDay. This allows you to limit the number of trades per day per pair. Leave this set to 0 for unlimited trades.

I need to add a bit more code to the function, so that the robot only looks at history trades for the current day. I will add this as soon as I can. For now, limit your history tab to 'today'.

Still to come: a maximum loosing trade per pair filter. The reason for this is: if we have already had x loosing trades, then there might be something going on in the markets that we do not know about, so stepping away is a good idea. Martingale. None of this is going to happen today. Sunday is a busy teaching day for me, giving piano lessons to beautiful children in their homes, in a lovely part of rural England.

Any other coders want to chip in with the missing stuff, feel free.

For each pair, the robot calculates the totals and stores them in the variables

int               open, won, lost, total;

They are declared in the general declarations section and calculated within void GetAggregatePosition(string symbol).

The robot therefore knows the aggregate position of the pair when it sends a call to void SendSingleTrade(int type, string symbol, double highest, double lowest)

The Martingale sequence would probably be most easily calculated from within the trade-sending function.

The formula Scott wants to use is: (

Total # of lots traded) + (last lot size traded) = (New lot size), so the steps would be

Initial trade .1

1 loss .2

2 losses .5

3 losses 1.3

4 losses 3.4

5 losses 8.9

6 losses 23.3

Not calculating any more - that is terrifying.

The use of Martingale needs to be optional, with a very strong warning that only the filthy, stinking rich can afford to use it.

If nothing else, even posting the mql coding algorithm for the above would be fantastically helpful, 'cos I have no idea what it is.

Remember folks, this robot might have a bug or two lying around, so it is only to be used on demo for now. It will be de-bugged by mid week.

When you first load the robot, the pair values will read zero. They are only calculated at the first tick after loadup.

Good luck this coming week.

Hi Steve, Thanks for V1.0, loaded it onto an IBFX demo chart.

Earlier (like prior to box start) I only got 000's in the PairsInformation area, then 5secs later it was replaced by the "... outside trade hours" comment as expected.

Now have figures, but groups of 6 "Alert 0" going off & that lovely bell noise too  - I happen to have 6 pairs (added GBPJPY).

Seems to be coming out of the Get_London_High function.

Was this put in to replaced that code from Sir Ronald ?

After an hour (& some fiddling) it seems to have stopped. So I reloaded the ea with London opens an hour later & yes, eventually got some alerts again x6. I cant work out what the start of that Get_London_High function is doing. TFH.

Have reset my LondonOpens, now its back to peacefull trading.

Oh - also couldnt find that MaxTradesAllowedForTheDay input.

I'll do another download incase I have had a brain fade while saving & copying files.

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I've got the same alert problem that I can't figure out and also no sign of the Max Trades Allowed input.

So I've removed the bot and will await feedback. I've got plenty of Steves other bots running so I'm not in a rush !!!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Same here... and for a weird reason the previous version is now doing the same thing.

Must be a global variable thingy....

--- 帖子 #218 ---
remove the line Alert(thour);

I think he must have left it in by accident during testing.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Many apologies guys. This is a classic example of why I do not use version numbers.

I uploaded the wrong version. Go back a few posts and re-download. This is the version I intended to post. It is trading peacefully, happily, and successfully.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Sorry Steve but is that post 174 or 213 ? Just checking before going thru the palaver of Copy/Paste and reopening MT4 etc etc several times. You know how it is. I'm not in a hurry !! Enough going on with your other bots today !!

Helo Mer071898

It's only 3 hour and half from London Breakout today, and I am already gaining almost 100 pips (trading with 7 pair) with your London Breakout system and The Trend Channel I have mentioned before in previous post.

This is the fourth day straight and this London Breakout system and The Trend Channel combination strategy is showing stronger result for me.

I just trade the pattern. Adding Trend channel  to your already great London breakout is really help to figure out the pattern.

Wish you good life and success with your future trading.

Just pu on my #2nd pase trap now...

Many thanks..man.

Hello guys,

I like the simple idea behind this system!

Here are my 2cents (1cent?...) contribution if i may:

I changed the indicators to make them STILL draw the box and the fibs when the box size exceeds "MaxBoxSize" input, but in different color (LightPink).

This gives an immediate view of what would have been the outcome of still trading it those "red" days.

Attached are the modified indies.

I might come back with another change i had in mind: drawing some green box showing when price hit the TP.

Again, the idea is to give immediate visual confirmation of the validity of the chosen input settings.

I still have to figure out MQL code for it, though -- i'm very new to MT4 yet...

Squalou.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
mer071898 - Thank you for the thread - an interesting breakout variation.

To those trying the EA - you might want to inform Steve that his GetHiLo() function has a serious bug in it.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi Squalo...

Please man.. Can you make the box and all the Fib not dissapearing on top or bottom of the screen?

Many thanks for your contribution... Will check your 2 color break out...

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hey NiceGuy,

I've seen once a box extending all the way to the top of the screen, and the fibs gone out wild, but i coudn't figure out why:

as far as i understand the code, the blue/pink "rectangles" should be limited by the Highest~Lowest prices between StartTime and EndTime.

After restarting MT4, it was looking "normal" again.

Must have something to do with the iHighest(),iLowest() or perhaps iBarShift() MT4 functions.

Price bars did look ok, though.

I don't have a clue yet... sorry.

Anyone else having a idea ?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Btw... Thanks Squalou..

Thanks for your attention. Well.. I am no coder nor EA Expert. So I am absolutely in blank page here....

Btw, I am seriously recommend to add Trend Channel to make this Great London Breakout strategy to more Powerful system, but still simple.

Just saw 7 trades in 7 different pair closed in my account this evening with total of 140 pips so far and it's still going right now. Starting from today's London breakout. Only Lost 10 pips. It's been four days straight that this strategy given me top result.

If anyone curious how I did this. Pls read my first post on this thread, about 2 pages from this post.

Now is time to set my 3rd pase of trap and go to bed...

Thanks Everyone..

Good luck with your trading.

Just to let everyone know, my EA appears to have done as required today.

14 trades: 7 winners: +31 pips: winning trades had bigger 'boxes' than the losers, which accounts for the profit.

I am putting this on one of my live accounts because this is the only test that really counts.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi steve

Do have to attach the EA everytime before the london open or can we leave it on the chart and it will open trades.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Set it, decide on your individual choices, then leave it to do its thing.

Give serious thought to stopping it trading from about 14.00 gmt. Once London goes home 2-3 hours later, the markets go dead until Sydney wakes up a few hours later. Trades placed during this period are highly unlikely to travel to a tp.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Added Steve's EA from post #213 to the first page.

Glad I can help contribute to your success. You should really think about posting your strategy in a new thread and let everyone see how it is progressing.

Excellent idea, let us know if you update it with a green box, I would be interested in seeing it.

niceguy, I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not going to change the basic strategy of the thread. Like I said above, if you feel it is a more profitable way to trade by adding whatever you are adding, please open your own thread and discuss it there. If people are interested, they can choose to add your indicator and trade it on their own or follow you over on your thread.

I don't want you to feel that your contribution is not important, I think it is a very interesting idea and may look into it myself, but I can't allow every trader who thinks his way is better to just run all over this thread and start to change everything and make things more confusing, understand?

Glad to see that you trust this enough to test live, but I would hold off til we get some more definitive results. But if you're determined, please use very small lots to start, otherwise I'd feel a little guilty if you accidentally blew up an account.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hehe. I have coded the occasional robot here or there, so I know how to test one live.
Backtesting - waste of time. Demotesting - not much better. I am certain the criminals bias their data feeds in favour of trading robots. No idea how, but it is simply amazing how often a robot performs fantastically well on demo, only to corpse the instant it hits a live account. The only way to test a robot is live. Anybody daft enough to think backtesting works, I merely refer you to point 2.

Thanks for your concern, Scott.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I think fxpro is currently GMT+3

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello Steve,

thank you for the EA.

It seems to me, that there is a bug in void GetHiLo(string symbol).

I mean that correct code should be:

//Calculate the high and low

bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, MODE_HIGH, StartShift - EndShift, EndShift + 1));

blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, MODE_LOW, StartShift - EndShift, EndShift + 1));

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Great piece of blunder-spotting, Pavel. Thanks. You earn your vouch over and again.

The blunder wasn't Sir Ronald's, it was mine when I adapted the code snippet he sent me.

Scott, you need to replace the version in post 1 with this one. Sorry about this; I know what a faff this involves.

By the by, I pm'd Matt Kennel today for the code for calculating the Martingale stuff. The guy is a genius, and was kind enough to supply it. I will add this tomorrow, along with the max losers allowed, then the robot is pretty much finished.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
hi guys

i am trying to get to understand better the system, if anyone can sumerize it please as cannot install mq4 so have to manualy set the system on my broker charts plesae,

whats the setup / trigger points / target tp and sl basis

thanks

btw, i trade cable and euro mostly

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thank you, Steve!

But I am sorry, you should change code a bit more, not only PERIOD_M15:

//Calculate the high and low

bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15,  MODE_HIGH, StartShift - EndShift, EndShift + 1));

blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15,  MODE_LOW, StartShift - EndShift, EndShift + 1));

note: mer07198 in his strategy uses bars for example from 4:00 till 7:15  (13 bars in M15), steve in his EA uses only bars from 4:00 till 6:59  (12 bars)

I hope I am correct.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Done!!

Are you not using an MT4 platform?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I think not this time. The robot has to find the highest and lowest prices in the range, so some kind of Mode_? is not relevant here.

Sing out if you think I am wrong.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Just noticed the +1 at the end of your snippet. Is this a necessary ammendment? I am happy to make it, if so?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I do set my times from 04:00 to 07:00 on my indicator because I feel if you are going to include the whole 04:00 candle that you should include the whole 07:00 candle as well, which goes til 07:15, hence 13 bars. But again that is my preference and is not set in stone.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
we can compare manual trading with 13 bars and EA with 12 bars - which one will be better

--- 帖子 #244 ---
It seems to me, that now first bar is for example 4:15, not 4:00 as is set. So +1 shifts beginning to the 4:00

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I think the code takes care of the entire range period, so I am going to leave it as it is.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Steve, you should still change the above marked "symbol" ....... in your current versoion it still has the "NULL" in there, so it would take only the value of the chart it is attached to!!

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Ok guys. Pavel has continued to nag me via pm. Never mind why, but he has learned in the past to carry on nagging when he knows he is right.

Ok, I will come clean. Anyone familiar with my work knows that I sometimes need nagging into life before I will take the actions required by the nagee. Said nagee is nearly always correct, otherwise they would not have the self-confidence to carry on nagging, because I can be lethal in my postings.

Pavel has finally banged my head against the wall sufficiently to make me see that my code does indeed have a fault, and a biggy. Redownload of the robot here is essential.

Sorry Scott, but you also need to replace the post 1 robot. If it is any consolation, this robot has far fewer bugs than one of my creations usually gives birth to. Pavel has spotted a real biggy; humungous; vast; epic.

Only an idiot would have failed to spot it.

Like me.

Mind, if the robot can be profitable today with a humungous coding blunder, then the future looks really bright without it.

Would any of those of you reading this with the ability to do so, please add a vouch for Pavel (maya007). The guy deserves far more than he has so far.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
But bar shift numbers count back to the left.

I found I had to use the +1 on the earlier parameter like:

double RangeHigh = iHigh(NULL, 0, iHighest(NULL, 0, MODE_HIGH, (StartTimeShift - EndTimeShift + 1), EndTimeShift));

double RangeLow = iLow(NULL, 0, iLowest(NULL, 0, MODE_LOW, (StartTimeShift - EndTimeShift + 1), EndTimeShift));

(Again - code is from a modified Sir Ronald ea).

It was drawing boxes & kept missing out the high or low of 1 of the end bars - cant recall which end tho.

Steve, I notice MODE_HIGH & MODE_LOW is shown in Meta Editer  help as

"Series array identifier used with ArrayCopySeries(), iHighest() and iLowest() functions."

- doesnt mean its right or that it works better though.

cheers scalpz

Added: Oh - ok so I'm a slow typer - thats why I need ea's

--- 帖子 #249 ---
The best way to check is  to have one chart open with the indicator on it and another chart of the same pair with the EA running and check out where entries are being placed and where stops occur. This is easier to do visually than trying to guess at what is working correctly or not

Changed in the first post. I'd vouch for him except I need one more voucher myself to be able to do so. So what was the big boo-boo anyhow?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
What is the PendingPipsDistanceOnReEntry function do??

--- 帖子 #251 ---
In most mql4 function calls, NULL means the current chart. When coding a multi-trader, NULL needs to be replaced by a variable that represents the pair being considered.

I use the string 'symbol' to do this, so coders looking at my code find it easy to check when I have gone wrong. Pavel knew that my use of NULL had to be incorrect, and just needed to nag me until I took some notice.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Maybe Pavel's better half was nagging at him and he had to take it out on you, lol!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
When the market has moved outside the box and the robot has taken a trade that has hit tp, it waits for a possible reentry.

Said reentry is supposed to happen when the market retraces to within the area within box and Entry. Rather than take an immediate market trade in the teeth of a possible move to the opposite extreme of the bos, the robot is supposed to send a pending trade at market +- PendingPipsDistanceOnReEntry

Truth to tell, I have been involved with another project today and so have not been taking much notice of the robot here. All I know is that it finished up in profit, despite some crippling bugs. This is normal for me, as I always involved in a project somewhere, so I ask users here to keep an eye on what is going on and shout out when bugs appear.

Pavel knows this only too well.

Whilst I am pleading for vouchers, could some of you able to do so add some for Scott, please. Without him starting this thread, none of us would be here and benefiting from his strategy; he deserves the recognition.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Pavel's wife is in a bad mood, so she kicks the dog. The dog takes it out on the cat. Who attacks the mouse in revenge. Who bites Pavel. Who spots an error in my code and takes it out on me.

Hehe. Lowest in the kicking chain, as usual.

Next bugs tommorow...

Liar.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Please bear with me on this one.  I'm on the east coast of the US, which is GMT -5.  For me to utilize this system, I think I have to set the breakout box for my platform to 22:00 - 01:00 (which matches 03:00-06:00 GMT).  However, if I set the indicator to these values, the display blows up.

Anyone have any suggestions as a work around?  I know I could manually calculate and draw out the 22:00 - 01:00 box on my screen, but I feel pretty confident that Steve's beautiful EA won't work correctly on my setup, as his code uses open/close box times just like the indicator.

Thanks very much,

Ed

Hi Ed,

It is your broker's timezone that matters, not your location's time zone. The simplest thing to know.

To know the hour difference:

- Open your chart, draw vertical line at the last bar, note the time.

- Open http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ and note the GMT time shown the page.

- Take the hour difference.

The problem regarding time setting = 22:00 - 01:00, I have addressed it on this post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...4&postcount=39

I attach the indicator below, adding MaxBoxSizeInPips as suggested by nightyhawk, adjustable Box, Fib and Fib Level color.

Edit: Pls ignore the previous London Breakout 3.mq4 that I posted on this post. The file below, LondonBreakoutV3.1 has simpler code than the previous one, yet it still has the same functionality.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I don't mean to sound critical here, but how is this different from the London Breakout 2 on post #1??? I did notice that your buy stops and sell stops are switched around.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hell I'm scared... but I will try anyway... closing my eyes and go through it.

Steve... I know you will shout, ban me from the thread, take of my voucher and put a spell on me and my family for the next 5 generations...

I know you always and all the time and everywhere are coding your EA's with Local Time.

The thing is... I'm running the EA on a Mac with a Crossover Emulator who is not taking the time correctly.

My 2 VPS servers are both in time zones where the box time goes over midnight (start box 23, end box 2) and I'm pretty sure the EA will refuse with these settings.

So here I go: Is there any chance to get your EA coded for broker time?

I can not believe I asked this.... my god.... hope we are still friends

Uli

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I wouldn't worry, Steve seems to be pretty open minded when it comes to getting suggestions from fellow traders. I, personally, would love to see the EA match up to the broker time as well.

I would also like to be able to have the EA trade straight through and just have the EA close all trades at the close of the first candle that starts our box as I would manually. I get a little too confused with the start/stop hours.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
You don't know this coding-monster when you p%$§ him off

You better run and hide...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I guess I'll just have to pray I stay on his good side.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
All you have to do is set the inputs to these values for 24 hour trading:

start_hourm = 0;

end_hourm = 12;

start_houre = 12;

end_houre = 24;

I will add the code to close any open trades at the start of the new box.

The robot should not have traded at all yesterday on 4 digit accounts. I had left in code that adjusted for 4 digit criminals twice; I discovered this a few minutes ago.

The fix is attached. Holders of 5 digit wally-plonker-criminal accounts do not need this update and can hang on until I add the remaining code.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Not even the beginnings of the dawning of the merest glimmering of a hope.

You can make the adjustment yourself. Change the line of code

int lhour = TimeHour(TimeLocal() );

to

int lhour = TimeHour(TimeCurrent() );

and recompile.

Tell you what, guys. In the next update I will add local and broker time displays to the screen feedback. If anyone wants me to, I will add a post here explaining how to make simple changes such as this to source code. Also, if you follow the link in my sig to the mptm thread, there is a pdf explaining how to do this - "How to edit a script code"; anyone with a firing brain cell can do make small changes to source code.

The reason I refuse to get involved with anything to do with time other than local time is beautifully demonstrated in the early pages of this thread. Don't bother asking me to change my policy; the answer will always be 'no'.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I knew it...

Thanks buddy... I thought about changing the code like you said... but wasn't sure that it would give the right result.

Will change the code myself... Tx again!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Yes, I know that.  My current "broker" time is 04:00 and the page above indicates the GMT time is 08:00.

I tried that one, and it does not work when you enter the 22:00 start time.  Any start time greater than the end time simply makes the indicator disappear.  Thanks anyway.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I also have changed and recompiled the code. Let's see how it works out for those of us in the US.

Cheers,

Ed

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I found the ant-GUBreakout indicator that allows me to set the Start/End times to 22:00/01:00, as you can see from this GU screen shot.  The modified EA also immediately fired off EU trades (both directions - pending), which is not seen on this screen.  Will monitor its progress to see what transpires, keeping in mind that this is based on US times.

Ed

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Sorry mate, I end up posted an old file. I have changed the indicator on my previous post (I named it LondonBreakoutV3.1.mq4), you can download it again.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Thanks.  Will give it a go right now.

Cheers,

Ed

--- 帖子 #278 ---
The new indi works like a dream.  I changed the default colors to my liking, and everything now looks pretty sharp on my particular system.

Thanks very much for the work, both to you for the indicator and to Steve for the EA.

Ed

--- 帖子 #279 ---
This version has: broker and local time display MaxLossesAllowedPerPair is an input that allows us to limit our losses on individual pairs. The rationale is this: if our trades lose a few times then there must be something going on in the markets that we do not know about, so it is better to step away for a while. There are a couple of things to note:setting the input to 0 turns this filter off it works by looking at all the trades in the History tab, so make sure you have it set to list only today's trades.   There is just the Martingale to go now. This is complicated and will take some time.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thank you for the update.  I have it up and running now, and it looks great.

Hello,

Steve please look at the void SendSingleTrade, there is a bug in the section "price is out of the box":
Inserted Code //Sell stop trade
if (type == OP_SELLSTOP)
{
....
//Allow for this being a reentry after a retrace
if [color=Red](bid < highest)[/color]
{
.....
The condition should be "(bid < lowest)".

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hello: i am trying to build a very simple ea. It has only a few lines, but i want it to test my strategy. The problem is that it doesn´t works. The ea is the next:

//---- input parameters

extern int       barback=7;

extern int       hora_de_trade=9;

extern int       minuto_de_trade=0;

extern int       TP=450;

extern int       fin_de_orden=24;

extern int       pips_sobre_el_maximo=33;

extern int       pips_bajo_el_minimo=12;

extern int       ancho_maximo=300;

extern double    tamano_de_lote=0.1;

int start()

{

double maximo = iHighest(NULL,0,MODE_HIGH,barback,1) + pips_sobre_el_maximo;

double minimo = iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW,barback,1)- pips_bajo_el_minimo;

if (Hour() == hora_de_trade && Minute() == minuto_de_trade && (maximo - minimo) < ancho_maximo)

{OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUYSTOP,tamano_de_lote,maximo,0,minimo,maximo + TP,"amilcar",0,fin_de_orden,Green);

OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELLSTOP,tamano_de_lote,minimo,0,maximo,minimo - TP,"amilcar",0,fin_de_orden,Red);

}

//----

return(0);

}

///the end.

Can somebody tell me wich is the problem?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I just couln't resist to share pending results at that time for today's breakout... (level factors set to entry=0.3;TP=1.3, i.e. the "mild" settings :-)

All pairs i monitored this morning have made 1 trade as of now: (noon GMT)

4 WINs / 1 pending / 0 LOSS !

EU: still pending

GU: +45p

GJ: +53p

EJ: +39p

UJ: +13p

EG: +11p

========

total :+ 161 pips !!!!!!!!!

This all just looks VEEEEEEEEEERY promising...

Great job mer...

Steve, i'll give a try to the bot as well.

Your multipair bots are just awesome!

I'll come back later with my "green box winners" extension to the indicator some time... still got to figure how to code that...

Squalou.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
The ea in NanningBob 60x90 has an option for a Martingale system. Perhaps you can borrow it. It keeps track of the level you're at (how deep into the martingale) and it has a user defined multiplier for the lotsize, so 1 for same lots all the time, 2 for double at each level, etc.

Another way would be to "read" the lotsize in the current open orders and multiply the largest by 2. Not experienced enough in mql4 to know how to do that though.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Nice one again Pavel. Cheers.

Coders need to make this change. Non-coders need to re-download from a few posts ago. I have edited it to include the fix.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I just finished my EA for testing the profitability of this strategy, especially the Martingale aspect.

My Martingale method calculates lot size based on Risk, which is equal to a percentage of Account Balance. When a trade is a loss, instead of double the previous trade's lot, I double the Risk. I use this method because the SL size of this strategy (hence the box size) varies from session to session.

Below is the equity curve for GU M15, from Jan to Dec 2009. I have bad history data in 2010 (lost 3 months data from Jan 2010 to Mar 2010).

I use the default setting, $10.000 account size.

Pls note that Box is drawn based on the highest/lowest price from 03.00GMT to 06.00GMT, while the indicator draw box from 03.00GMT to 06.15GMT.

The EA attached is experimental... It can contain errors...

Edited: formula for risk-based-lot-calc was for 5-digits broker. When used on 4-digits, it gave 10 times than it ought to be. Now it should be normal..

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Attached is an updated Indicator with the following extensios:

- added inputs:

- SessionEndTime for future use (the "green box"!)

- EntryFactor (0.3)

- TPFactor (1.3)

- Profit Target and Stops are printed in pips in addition to Price

- It also includes changes from Sangmane V3.1 :-)

Sangmane, can you post the .mq4 of your EA instead of the EX4 ? Thx

Sq.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
hi steve, i may be wrong but there's something not working properly with the re-entry stuff:

on eurusd for example the prices just cross down the long entry point, this should generate an input for a new buy at pipsdistance etc, the ea instead places a pending sell at pips distance!

then how can i switch off the re-entry part? should i take a look at the code?

thanks.....

ps i really appreciate all of your ea's....i'm one of the first readers of the boj thread even if as i'm not particularly able in coding i never achieved the vouch to write there!

EDIT:   ok we almost wrote together! u already fixed this!!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Done.  Thank you.

Ed

--- 帖子 #290 ---
He can not place a buy stop as he is still in the buy trade on EU.

At least here...

--- 帖子 #291 ---
ya but that was because i switched it on late to tes the re entry stuff!

anyway it seems somone else spotted the error and steve already fixed it!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
You can post in the BOJ and BS threads now.

Those re-entries are incorrect, so turn them off for now - the new input is AllowReEntries.

There is a flaw in the logic. Damned if I can work out what it is.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Working fine here.

EU buy reached SL and a new buy stop was placed immediately.

What is your net profit in pips for whole year test? Can you EA mq4 file?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi sangmane

Promissing result

Does Your EA works with both 4 and 5 digit criminals?

Cheers

Elovv

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi kijkij,

Your username is unique. It forms triangle on keyboard layout

@Squalo:

As I've stated in my post, I code that EA in order to find out what parameter (TimeStart/End, Entry/TP/SL scale factor, MaxBoxSize, etc) for each pair that will give good result. I haven't posted the mq4 file so that we can focus more on finding the good parameter for the strategy and share it to the forum. I'm affraid if I post the mq4, the discussion focus will be shifted to the code, not the strategy itself.

Besides, there is nothing so special in the code. It's the strategy parameters and improvements that important. Once the strategy is considered to be reasonable profit and stable, there are many programmers that can make EA

@Ellov, I don't understand what do you mean by digit criminals. Is it something related to digit manipulation? EA accept input in pips for Min/MaxBoxSize in pips, regardless your broker's digit.

If there are parameters that you don't understand, kindly ask it

Cheers

--- 帖子 #297 ---
It would be interested to see how your martingale and the rest of your money management did from Jan to March1st of 2010 as I found it to be hard on the account based the original martingale proposed; the reason is martingaling without taking into account the amount lost and simply multiplying the lot size may not be sufficient to recoup if the successive wins are small (because of small raging boxes) ..... that's what happen in Feb-March2010 on GU if I remember well (that's what caught my attention earlier ... it may be ok for the account if trading multiple pairs though. I did not check that)

Now I understand this is not the point of the thread thus if you want to share thoughts on money management to back-up this nice strategy, please PS me.

PS: for re-entry, use a MTF trend line not to re-enter small ranging conditions and get into multiple losses ... just a thought ;-)

XmPh.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Nice job on this, and some nice results I am seeing as well.

I have backtested it on dukascopy tick data from 4/12/09 til 4/17/10 using default.  I did have to eliminate the two weeks around xmas/new year, but final result from 10k starting balance and default ea settings is 31.2k ending balance.

Appears DD ran about 38%

Good work!

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Sangmane,

no problem, i was curious about the martingale code.

"criminals" or "crims" is Steve's word for "brokers"

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Squalou,

The basic code of Martingale:

1. find the number of the last number of successive losses, lets say N

2. calculate lot size based on N and the starting lot:

lot = MathPow(Multiplier,N)*initlot

Classic Martingale uses Multiplier = 2.

simple routine for calculate the last number of successive losses:
PHP Code  int LossesCount()
{
int Cnt=0;
for(int i = OrdersHistoryTotal()-1; i>=0; i--)
{
OrderSelect(i,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_HISTORY);
if(OrderProfit()>0) break;
Cnt++;
}
return(Cnt);
}

then,
PHP Code  lot = MathPow(Multiplier,LossesCount())*initlot;

Now, I feel like we are in Programming Discussion Folder

--- 帖子 #301 ---
thx Sangmane, i appreciate you giving the code snippets.

I tried backtesting Steve's EA with MT4's-tester, but it took sooooooooooo long just to get over a few days that i cancelled it...

is this some kind of MT4 flaw ?

If we are going to look for the best inputs, it will take years before we find the "optimal" settings...  and we would of course do that for many pairs...

Is there any other way to reliably and efficiently backtest and optimize an EA ?

(ok, another programming-related question... sorry  )

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Man, you guys and all this code being thrown around is making me dizzy!  I've updated Steve's EA in the first post.

squalou, I really like what you've done with the indicator. The box color when the box size is too big is a plus and especially adding the pips on the stop levels and the profit targets. I will make the few changes to it listed below and replace the code on the first London Breakout indicators in post #1 and also add new templates. Now remember, the box times in the templates are based on GMT +0 so be sure to adjust them to the proper broker's time.

Changed:

1) Change default time to GMT +0 time of 03:00 and 06:00, you can make your broker adjustments from there.

2) I'm not sure what the SessionEndTime parameter entails, but I set it to 03:00 which is right at the start of a new session, which is normally when I would close all open trades.

3) Increase the spacing between the price and the pips on the stop levels and profit target levels so it's not so hard to distinguish

4) Removed the FiboColor input parameter because, well, it just doesn't do anything.

5) Changed the BoxColorNOK input (color of the box when greater than MaxBoxSizeInPips) to Red as I would like to see that stand out and really come over as a big Red flag (pardon the pun)

Alright, results for Tuesday!

Eur/Usd was the big key as we are starting out tonight with a multiplier of 13 after 3 losses to end last night. We started out with an initial loss of -46 pips (which I'm sure those who are watching the martingale aspect of this are getting a little nervous), but backed that up with a +35 pip winner, finally!

-46
+35   =
-11 pips

+1190 (+35 x 34) =
+592 pips

We'll start out fresh tonight with no multipliers.

Your welcome. Breakouts are pretty simple and basic strategy to understand, hence their popularity. I bet there are probably a 100+ variations of this type of breakout on the web if you searched hard enough.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Sangmane's ea is tracking identically with your trades merl with only the following exception.

For reentrys, it waits until price gets back into the box then pops back out for a trade to be taken, where your's just takes it as soon as price taps the initial entry again.  Curious of whether results this way are better/worse.  Something to check out I guess.

But otherwise, with a small tweak to the box end time, and final trade close time, its matching up perfectly.  Just figured i'd let you know.

Hey Guys...

Need a help here..

I am new to this "robot" thing.

Tried to load steve's Ea inside FXOpen demo...

Done with the setup and everything..

Everything was ok for few minutes.

But suddenly I got the message

"Trading was disabled by Criminal Pillock. Please wait him to get out of bed"

Is this a problem with my settings ?

Or this script will not work with this broker?

Or should I have to wait for this criminal to wake up like it said?

Last Candle show 9.00 in FxOpen time. It's GMT +3.

It's near London breakout...by the way. If I fail this now I have to wait for tomorrow to try this script again..

Thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
In the code, this comes from the IsTradeAllowed() function being false.

MetaEditor help shows the function as:

"bool IsTradeAllowed()

Returns TRUE if the expert is allowed to trade and a thread for trading is not occupied, otherwise returns FALSE."

Maybe you have to select "live trading allowed" under your expert properties common tab.

Well maybe not too late with a little hindsight. 3 of my trades have been triggered, but are now looking bad.

Now would be a good time to setup the ea & have the pending trades loaded and waiting to trigger from now (0815gmt).

Hello there...Scalpz

Good luck with your trading...!

Btw... I trade this london breakout manually with 8 pairs. Yesterday was 7 pairs. Yess... 8 Pairs...LIVE... Dont worry I know what I am doing.

I always went with Steve's Opinion.. "Backtesting is useless" and the only way to be sure that a strategy worth or not is put it to live..

Have tested this strategy 6 days now... Looking Good so far.

This strategy helped me revived USD 234 in my long forgotten account into almost triple its worth only  in 5 days...

I just need to learn its weakness in different pairs before putting it in my main account.

These guys are amazing...

Thanks again

PS: Correction... actually it's not 8... but 9 pairs today...

Please, I want somebody to help me with the latest version of both the indicator and Steve's EA.

I am now confused with the variuos indicators posted on the thread everyday.

I downloaded v.3 and the buy stop snd sell stop were switched.

I think v.3 of the indicator presents the system well.
In view of these changes, I therefore ask for the current Version so as to start testing the strategy on my account.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Post #1 was updated yesterday with all the current indicators, EAs and templates.  Hope this helps.

Yes Confirmed minor problem with the London Indi.

For GU, GJ, EG the Buy and Sell Stop are switched. But nothing is wrong with other pairs without GBP involved.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
You're welcome, mer.

Glad to see that you like it!

SessionEndTime is meant for my future "winners green  box" stuff.

However, i have now a use for it already in my next version of the indy, attached here:

it shows the daily session period as a different "background" color.

Select color with "SessionColor" input.

If you don't want any background, just set the color to your current chart background!

Give it a try

V4 had it fixed, and so does V5 below.

If V5 passes mer's "approval"  , then it should be put to post#1 soon

Hi All  Good work on everything you have done..good team work

Squalou...I like what you did in version 4 but I would opt out of V5 right now..I gave it a try and it was a big pink box and a tiny little blue box.  One thing I was thinking was different color zones would make it easier to see the levels.  Example the box area blue (or Pink) all the way across. From the buy entry to the target up green and from sell entry to target down red....

Don't now if that would have any real strategy value but it would look pretty...

Mer ....Somebody mentioned earlier in the thread that if they lived closer they would buy you a drink....Well I am only a few hours NW of you on the MN side of the border....Make us all rich and drinks..(or lunch) is on me..

--- 帖子 #326 ---
well... here is how GU looks to me right now, with the "default" settings altered for my time zone (GMT), as you can see from the dialog box.

I can't see any "BIG pink" box, only the yellow-ish "strip" covering the trading session time, i.e. 08:00-05:00(next day), and the blue/red pre-breakout boxes.

This "strip" has nothing to do with the blue/red pre-breakout boxes.

How does it look like to you ?

My actual SessionEndTime setting is 18:00, which makes my yellow strip narrower.

Maybe someone (can't be me, I'm on his ignore list) can convince Steve that his calculation for the Low of the box is still incorrect - see the box low in the EA for EURUSD today for an example. This fix was previously discussed, but he seems unwilling to change it for some reason.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks Ed,

I will go back to download the updated versions.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I love it!!! Here's how I would see using it. As we all know, I try and close out all open trades by 04:00, right? Let's use this function to set up a end session time where no more new trades are taken, say 00:00 or 01:00.

The only thing I see wrong is that it's printing on the Friday 21:45 candle as you can see in the pic, is this a bug? It never did this with the previous version.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I might just have to take you up on that.  Anyone can become rich trading forex as long as you can be disciplined and have strong money management.

Instead of using a solid color, maybe you could use a thin outline of the box instead, maybe from the entry point to where it hit target or where it was stopped out? Too many solid boxes could get a little confusing. You might want to make that a True/False type of input like a "ShowCompletedTrades" function as I'm sure there are those who are not thrilled to have a Christmas tree popping up on the screen.

Well, I don't think that is the issue here. Steve has a lot of projects going on and is probably extremely busy. I'm sure he might just need to be reminded a little more than normal, like pavel does.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
yep... Friday's buggy for sure!

that has to do with your setting SessionEndTime to 00:00 probably.

Probably a combined side effect of the different broker local time.

I don't get this on my charts, even with that setting.

Markets close on Friday at 00:00 in your time zone, right ?

Anyway, attached is the fixed version, i called it V5.1.

BTW, the "yellow-ish" strips look more like "apricot" on my laptop... interesting...

Or would it be like PapayaWhip ?

Bad day today for the LondonBreakout... had only EG +21p, all others went to SL basement...

Ok, i think i'm off for tonight (it's past 11pm here in Aix en Provence...).

Tomorrow never dies!

--- 帖子 #337 ---
oops, forgot to answer that one...

i was thinking exactly the same thing while riding my bike uphill back home... it helps to get fresh air sometimes!

I'll make it green/red lines between entry-exit points, and optional for sure!

Another interesting extension would be to draw some sort of "equity curve" separately at the same time, showing the results in pips over the NumDays period.

Some kind of "back-testing" intant result, rather than running the MT4 tester for who-knows-how-many-minutes !

Finally, "cherry on top of the cake", how we say it in France (i'd be curious on the English equivalent...), code an "optimizer" for the equity curve, to find-out the best inputs, and VOILA!, you got THE winner breakout system...

Wow, i think i got my load of work pile here... :nerd:

ok, Bed time !!! (this is addicting, i know...)

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thanks for the quick fix, it was doing it even if i set the SessionEndTime to 03:00. The indicators and template are added to post #1. The only change I made was the color was changed to Linen by default to make it a little lighter on the eyes.

Over the last few days, I have been pondering the thought of backing up the start and end times by 1 hour as I'm really seeing a lot more movement in the last hour of the box than there really should be. It's acting like the Frankfurt open has started early, if you know what I mean. It must be the confusion from all this British Summer Time in my opinion.

A good example is the Gbp/Usd from this morning as we saw a an almost 50 pips climb from the 06:00 candle  to the end of the box at 07:00 (on my chart). I've set up two charts, one with times from 04:00 to 07:00 on the left and 03:00 to 06:00 on the right. *This example is based off of my broker' time which is at GMT +1 (see pic).

As we can see we would've had a "No Trade" situation on the left chart with the box on the over +50 pips. Now, as we see on the right chart, we would've produced +112 pips. So my question to everyone here would be:

Would it be more beneficial to adjust our box times 1 hour earlier?

*The default times from post #1 are based off of GMT +0 which would translate to 03:00  to 06:00 and 02:00 to 05:00, respectively.

I will leave it open for discussion.

Hello Steve,

No worries. You are truly a giver. I was just passing on the information.

Well, if we looking through the past few days. Yes, you are right.

But it doesnt mean that the pattern will be the same in the future.

For me it's not really important where the London Open in my chart. I am a trader and I care more about making profit and securing my investment. So I fire my trade whenever there's a good chance to make profits with less risk. I guess we all do.

The fact that the movement pattern is a bit amplified after the London Open is all we need. We do not need to be precise when, because the movement will stay strong about 4-6 hours in front.

I adjust my box differently for every pair. I trade live with 9 pair to see how it works. I just put the pattern into profitable area in past few days and fire my trade manually.  I know Mer will hate me when I suggesting to use another indicator. Well, I am not. But for me, it really helps me to find where to fire my trade and securing me from lost trade if I use trend channel indicator. It works like wonder for me.

So whenever I have a big Box... I adjust it back and forth around London Open times. When I see  my TP is more achieveable I fire it off.... Its as simple as as that. Hits about 90% of time.

As for the robot, well Steve is so Genius, he prevent us from dealing with big box. But if I do get the big box too often, it means a change in the daily pattern movement is going on. Then I just adjust it back and forth to make it more profitable. Again Steve is so genius so he let me choose to start to trade whenever I want to in local time. So I think there's no problem.

Well, I just giving my opinion not suggesting anything here. This is just how the indicator work best for me. That's all.

Keep up the good work guys....

Hi mer071898,

Just being a newbie in FX trading I wish to have some clarification & or guidance.

Firstly I live way down in the south pacific ( the land downunder), when you are discussing the 3.00- 6.00 time are you referring to the time in London as 3.00am to 6.00 their time?

Assuming I have that correct, I have backtested that time with some eye opening results.

2:- Thinking outside the square I have tried to use the same principal in relation to the Tokyo opening. Early results indicate that this isnt anywhere as successful.

3:-Again thinking outside the square I was wondering how this would apply to the U.S open, but I am unsure as to what time frame and City this would apply to.

Would you be able to assist me in this area?

Regards

Gann Fan.

yesterday has been a bad day, lots of SL. when market is range bound we hit SL on both sides.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Sorry - that was my fault - I went live!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Okay, here is my understanding of things. London open is normally 8:00 UK time (2:00 am EST for me) and the Frankfurt open is 1 hour earlier at 7:00 am UK. This would normally be GMT +0, but we are in British Daylight Savings time until Oct. 31, 2010, which now makes the London open and Frankfurt open now GMT +1.

In reality, according to our resident time expert billbss, this means that the London and Frankfurt open are technically opening up at 7:00 am and 6:00 am UK time respectively. And since the strategy is suppose to utilize the 3 hours before the Frankfurt open, we use 03:00 to 06:00. Remember, this indicator is based on your broker time and not your local time. Since my broker is GMT +1, I use 04:00 to 07:00.

I hope that explains it for you because I'm always a little fuzzy on it myself. If you don't understand, PM billbss on the forums here and he can probably give you a better explanation than I can.

Welcome to the world of Forex trading my brother. You have to take the good with bad, there's no way around it.

Now before I start tonight, I'm going to experiment with starting my box time 1 hour earlier so that we can see the impact of the time change. So you'll see two sets of results, one will be from 04:00 to 07:00 (which I'm currently using) and one will show from 03:00 to 06:00. I will forgo any long explanations and focus on the results only and provide charts of both time sets.

Mer, just to give you some rough feedback about your 1 hour earlier change

I used Sangmane's ea (which has the box entries perfectly in line with your trades, however the reentries are slightly different, I explained in an earlier post) to backtest the hour change for you on just GU for a 1 year period

It also uses your martingale method

10k starting balance

Original hours: profit +$2440

Adjusted hours: loss -$4870

Obviously, this is only 1 pair over 1 year, but not nice even so

Just thought i'd give some feedback

--- 帖子 #355 ---
If you went back one year it would be interesting to see if the results were different during this daylight savings time he is talking about here.  If there is any affect is should be obvious on both time frames you back tested.

April 2009 until Oct 31 2009 should show a different win percent the Oct 31 2009 until now...IF the hour time frame matters....

If I could I would test those dates separate with the 4 - 7 and the 3-6..

Just a thought

hi all, back on line...

other ideas came up during the night...

I was quite surprised to read NiceGuys post #342... it puts words to my overnight idea...

The question was: how could we fine-tune the levels if we want them different from the box size, however keeping the box as the basis?

Answer: add a LevelsResizeFactor input...

So i couldnt resist to produce yet another indy, V6, which has this new input.

Default is 1.0, which leaves everything exactly as before: nothing changes.

Now, if you set it to 0.7, then all levels will adjusted as if the box was actually squeezed by this factor, still centered to the actual box "mediantPrice".

Here are 2 pix: one with "standard" 1.0 factor (same result as revious versions), the other with LevelsResizeFactor=0.7.

See how the levels are being adjusted around the box mediant price.

V6 attached here for your review.

Got to rush to work now!

Problem is here:
Inserted Code //Calculate the high and low
bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, [color=Red]PRICE_HIGH[/color], StartShift - EndShift, EndShift));
blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, [color=Red]PRICE_LOW[/color], StartShift - EndShift, EndShift));
Change PRICE_HIGH / PRICE_LOW to MODE_HIGH / MODE_LOW will fix it. Longer description of this problem I sent you in my last PM two days ago.

Thank you.

that's the one with03:00-06:00 GMT...i use itand yesterday,i made about 130 pips in 4 trades altogether...the entry and TP got hit 4 times and today, my second trade is on it's way to hit TP as I type.

I trade GU alone...SEE THE CHART ON ATTACHMENT BELOW

Cheers. I also had a look at the indi code and noticed a couple of =1's missing from mine.

Inserted Code //Calculate the high and low
bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, MODE_HIGH, (StartShift - EndShift [color=Red]+ 1[/color]), EndShift));
blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, MODE_LOW, (StartShift - EndShift [color=Red]+ 1[/color]), EndShift));

This has made to figures even more accurate - not always absolutely correct but much nearer.

I might try a NormalizeDouble to see if that works.

If any of you compile this code, ignore the 'warning' about the int LossesCount(). I copied it into the code but have done nothing to implement it yet.

!!! BUGFIX for London BreakoutV4,V5,V6 !!!

Ok, while trying to play around with the various factors, i hit a bug that affects versions V4, V5, and V6 of the indicator...

(so, MY versions of it...  )

However it will not show up with the default *Factors, so you're still safe using them with the default *Factors.

It starts showing up when EntryFactor and TPFactor differ by something different than 1.

For instance EntryFactor=0.3 and TPFactor=2.0 will give you wrong levels.

But 0.5 / 1.5 are ok.

The V6.1 below fixes this issue.

Sorry about that...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Sound like a brilliant Idea....

.. whew....honestly.....I am not exactly sure what it means

Never been good in math and code... all I see is the pattern

Squalo, something important should not to be forgotten. I never place 2 stop on both side at the same time. If the box is too small, it's too risky. After London Open the  movement pattern tends to gets way bigger than the box ...  too many SL will got hit. I place my Stop order every 3-4 hour. One at atime.

btw just got 5 hits on GBPJPY, GBPUSD, EUROJPY, USDCHFand EUROUSD. Not counting the pips yet... earn me around 90 bucks or so already.

Why change something which already fantastic from the start?

But...I' ll give it a shot!

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Yes, about +1 I wrote here  http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=238

box of 12 bars but with shift - based on your original code:

bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15,  MODE_HIGH, StartShift - EndShift, EndShift+1));

blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15,  MODE_LOW, StartShift - EndShift, EndShift+1));

or box of 13 bars - mer65465 original strategy:

bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15,  MODE_HIGH, StartShift - EndShift +1, EndShift));

blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15, iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15,  MODE_LOW, StartShift - EndShift +1, EndShift));

--- 帖子 #364 ---
One question to the strategy - what to do with opened BUY STOP and SELL STOP trades when they were not filled till new box is formed?

Leave it open or close for example at London close?

Currently EA leaves this trades opened, so they can be open weeks...

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I can see several cases for wanting to use LevelsResizeFactor != 1.0:

- case 1: when the box gets red -- it's higher than 50 pips -- you might want to narrow the levels, because the strategy suggests that there is too much volat.

So you may want to bypass the "don't trade" rule, and set LevelsResizeFactor to 0.8 or 0.7 to narrow all levels and not have the TP too far away, hoping to still reach it.

- case 2: -- this one requires math skills for sure... --

the idea here is that i find the Reward:Risk ratio a bit too much against us:

with EntryFactor=0.3 / TPFactor==1.3 (the defaults), you end up with RR = 1 / 1.3;

i.e. when your TP is +10p, your SL is -13p (not counting spread).

Your SL is bigger than your TP.

If you want to make this RR a bit better, you would like to make your SL closer.

That's where the LevelsResizeFactor can be of use:

setting it to < 1.0 will make your SL line closer to the box midpoint, therefore reducing SL.

Now it will also require to adjust both the EntryFactor and TPFactor at the same time to keep them at required levels -- that's where the math comes into play...

or you can just play with the values until it draws something to your taste...

Try with the following settings and compare the lines with original settings, to give you an idea of what i'm talking about:

EntryFactor = 7    (yes, no commas here!)

TPFactor    = 17

LevelsResizeFactor = 0.1

(meaning the two SL lines will be norrowed down to only 1/10th of the box size, almost to the midpoint)

You'll see the TP pips identical, but SL pips quite less.

It's just a new possiblity offered by the indicator, which still keeps the original behaviour as the default, so everyone can be happy with it.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Finally, I have someone that use my EA and give feedback.

Tazman, you are right about my EA's reentry. I think if we are talking about breakout, it has to go inside the range before making a new trigger. Re-entry just because it taps the initial entry, make it a "bouncing" instead of "breaking out". Anyway, I'll recode the EA to see if  we get difference result.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi Squalou...

I have enough trade for tonight. So decided to try your Latest indi version.

I dont have a clear idea with your math theory... but I really do like what I saw on my screen....

I am already happy with Mer's original Indi but now I am happier...

I like my TP closer..... so it hits faster.... More than once if it's possible.

You read my mind!!! Simply Fantastic!

btw.. after studying Mer's latest trade plan for tonight, I think the strategy sounds like "London Trapper" now... hmmm...Interesting.....

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Glad to have convinced you!

So you like case 1... (even using it on blue box rather than just on red)

-> less TP but more often perhaps

...might give good results as well.

Time will tell.

Just need now to apply that to Steve's EA after coding the inputs into it.

(or Sangmane or Mer but we don't have the code for them  ... ok just kidding  )

I'm not going to do that now -- too busy!

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Sangmane,

I coded both and realize bouncing introduces too much risk in the long run when waiting for a true "breaking" in the right trend is the way to go (that was the point of my earlier posts). You might be willing to investigate in re-dimensioning the box after a bounce ... it shows promise in what I have to prevent re-entering false signals. This is close to the idea of adjusting the TP/SL around the median box size but I like to keep the orginal structure for the first entry as it is good, it is the re-entry that should be worked on ... mainly to recoup from a losing first signal. (my 2 cents).

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #370 ---
xmph,

I also found that one breakout per trade give slightly better PF.

Regarding time zone, currently (DST) Alpari UK clock is GMT+2. But because Alpari UK using CET (currently London Time+1) and Alpari adjust their clock to DST, I don't see the need to know the hour difference between Alpari Time zone with GMT. Alpari's  clock is always one hour ahead of London Time, regardles DST status.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I know this is not the programming forum, but...

Wouldn't it be easier to just do the time conversion (Time Zone and DST) automatically in the EA/indicator?

The user specifies the box times and the "Session". For example, for this strategy, the user would specify:

Box Start Time = 05:00

Box End Time = 08:00

Session = EUR

These inputs would be the same for everyone. Then, programmatically convert the times based upon the broker TZ, the session TZ, and DST settings.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Ah coders.... why not use strictly TimeLocal? Its prevent from DST, GMT offset, question about I am from Russland, Arabia, US, UK, etc, etc... Yes, for system description must author use GMT.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I've had it running for 2 days no trades yet

steve's has had some ....so not sure reason I have a 5 digit criminal

--- 帖子 #374 ---
sqaulou, I really do appreciate your contributions, but i think we need to slow it down a little. In the span of a week we went from version 1 to version 6!. If we keep at this pace we're all going to be in disarray of what indicator does what. This last version has a great concept, but the whole idea is to keep the entry points outside of major fib extensions and if we change the re-size factor, you'll have a rough time telling where these levels are. I have really loved all the changes so far, but I'm not really too keen on this one myself.

First off, there should be only one order open at a time on the pair your trading. I haven't played with the EA at all but if is placing pending orders on both sides, the EA should delete the pending order on the side that was not triggered until a profit target is hit or a stop is hit, then the EA should reset and place new pending orders on both sides. Any open trades should preferably be closed, whether in profit or not, by the start of the new box.

But that is the whole concept behind adding in the martingale, because even though your loss was larger, you'll still end up in profit when the smaller Take Profit target hits.

And I guarantee you'll hit your stoploss a lot more often as well, which is kind of defeating the purpose, isn't it? But as a fair man, I will work on putting in in post #1 for those who would want to use that particular function along with Steve's updated EA.

You have to understand that we are dealing with fib lines here. If any of you have used fibs in your trading can testify to how many times price has hit a major fib line or extension right to the pip. That is why I consider it a re-entry when price retraces back to the entry even if it is by .001 of a pip, a touch is a touch. Sometimes price won't reach back to the boundaries of the box. A perfect example was on the Gbp/Usd this morning where we had a retrace back to the entry point right to the pip! If you took this you just added +30 more pips to your bank account. (see pic)

(wonder if your pic will post again?)

Hi mer0, thanks again for your great idea's & thread.

Noticed in a sell EURUSD trade last night on an IBFX demo account that the ask price went past the TP line by 5 pips & showed that on the chart, but the trade wasnt closed. Normal spread for that pair is 2 pips. Thought WTF.

Opened little tick chart but spotted nothing. Hit F9 for a bigger tick view and just spotted a huge 8 pip spread going off the left of the chart but the following ticks spreads were returning to normal as the ask price came back up.

So spotted the crim manipulating or maybe its their "liquidy providers"/ market makers stop hunting other live accounts.

Interesting to see it just off the crucial spot. Buy end of trades seem the most vulnerable to spread changes. Thats close of a short or open of a long.

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Just a quick reminder for those looking at trades this morning, try and close out open trades earlier than normal being it's Friday. As a general rule, I will not open any trades once the London session closes.

Got it ! I must admit i've been quite prolific these days... I'm trying to keep everything working the same as previous version (appart from bug fixes, of course), so that noone gets confused.

This is also why i put the version number in the filename,, which helps identify which one you have downloaded and using.

Perhaps post #1 should follow the same rule, so people know exactly which version is the latest "approved" one ?

I work in a s/w company, and we know how much version numbers are important for everyone (us and our customers) to clearly identify what we are talking about when issues raise.

I will slow down the versions, i promise!

I have a confidence issue with martingales, as lot of people have... really big drawdowns can happen, even if "you know" that "some day" it will come back into your direction, in profit due to multipliers.

But you have to have "big pockets" to sustain the losses in the first place. That's what scares me about martingales.

Looking at your results, however, that is quite promissing indeed.

But with a so small data sample, we cannot conclude yet on the longer term.

Keep posting both results, that is the most important to validate the strat.

A suggestion if i may: would it be possible to update something like an excel sheet (easier for the math!) that summurizes all these results day after day for each pair, with/without martingale, martingale multiplier, etc, and grand totals, all together in 1 sheet, and update that file in post #1, so we can all see how it goes over time ?

That would be great!

You might be right. At least we can give it a try, and confront the results. It's worth trying it.

It could actually also be part of the excel sheet results, to see how both settings compare -- we need to choose some settings in the first place, i know... and that's the most tricky part of it...

This is perhaps where my "future extensions" i talked about some days ago, would be of interest: they will hopefully show resulting figures instantanously right before your eyes: an "equity curve" talks to me much better than raw fugures.

Then you can just play with the settings to see if you can get better results.

-- until i get the "optimizer" working!

Experimentation is part of the research work, which is what we are doing here in my opinion.

And most often requires to build your own "tools" and improve them,  to get the best results in the end.

To me, improving tools also means adding more capabilities to them, thereby increasing exploration possibilities.

Some day you choose some unexplored path, and you like what you find at the next corner... Let's just not close those doors.

Ok, i'm getting away from the thread's subject now, so i'll stop here!

Let's come back to what is going to happen in next few hours, London has waken up guys!

Mer, hopefully i won't have got you angry at me for talking all this... appologies if i have.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Mer,

looking at yesterday's trades on UJ, i 'don't get the 2 "touches" that we can see on your charts.

Different price feed again... (Alpari for me).

See below

--- 帖子 #384 ---
but recently always fake breakout.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Yes, the sometimes quite large differences in feeds makes any strategy using fixed numbers a tough call.

Attached is screen shot of two Alpari feeds superimposed - these SHOULD be the same - right?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Even the SAME BROKER will give DIFFERENT PRICE FEEDS to different accounts ?

Interesting...

I remember having read in some other thread that brokers would typically have at least 2 different price feed "profiles", depending on the type of orders you are inputting ("scalping" profile vs "long-term" profile perhaps ?)

Thanks for the input.

So, i guess some will just get lucky with the touches, and others won't...

Welcome to "criminals" wonderland  !

--- 帖子 #387 ---
not all touch give lucky trade..

--- 帖子 #388 ---
The price feeds do differ on the same broker when they use multiple servers. Not sure about the different price feed "profiles", depending on the type of orders you are using, but different servers give different results.

First off, no apologies are ever necessary in my threads. I expect people to speak there mind, as a matter of fact, I encourage it. I will not always agree, but that is just my opinion and is to be taken as just that, an opinion. I will not speak harshly to anyone unless they try and hijack my threads or they violate forum rules.

I love experimentation and I applaud you for your help and all your work, right along with Steve, sangmane, and all the others with various ideas, EA's, and improvements. Let's just slow down a bit, step back, and see how the indicators operate first and maybe it will allow you test the indicator thoroughly to see and fix more than one bug at a time instead of immediately posting a new version at the first instance of a bug popping up. With regards to putting versions up, what I will do in the next version you post is I will just post a single indicator and template and everyone can make there own changes from there since we now have that freedom to do so in the parameters, fair enough?

Hi Guys

I realize this may well be a dumb question but I"ll give it a go anyway. On Fridays GBP/USD I had a red box on my chart(alpari uk) so over50 pips so no trade, so I assumed steves ea would not take any trades on this pair but it took a buy and a sell(both losses). So my question or questions , should I have turned ea off on this pair or should ea have known it was over 50 pips and not entered any trades?

Just as a side issue although the box was red the actual low of lowest candle and high of highest candle which the three hour box covered was not 50 pips it was actually 46 pips, so why the red box?

All other pairs with ea worked a treat .

Many Thanks

Geoff

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I took the following pairs and sim tested them

with and with out martingale . . . graph results in zip file

01-01-2009 12-31-2009

EJ EU GU UC GJ UJ EG

GU did better than others UC worst

EJ was the bst by far

None were profitable

I used default settings with a 5000 start up.

Non of the no martingales showed promise

I did then test EJ with takeprofit changed from 1.27 to 1 and here is a very nice result

Some of the pairs with martingale were doing well until the death blow of the martingale and I got stopped out. Playing around with box size and start times next By using the ea and taking over manually from time to time could work well.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I'm sure if you pm Steve, he will get you an answer.

That's the best way to find the best settings, experimentation. Most of the time when martingale EA's are tested, no one uses the proper account size. You can't try and use $5K when you should be using more like $50K.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
That is true . .  with a bigger bank roll one can survive the DD

but the more smooth climbing graph line creates less gray hair lol

--- 帖子 #402 ---
OF course the drawdown of that, is if you need 50k to fund your martingale method, the profit gained on your little .01 lot trades is pretty miniscual.

So your ROI is pretty low i'd assume.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I'd agree if all I traded was .01 lots, but not every trade is like that. You've see the pips that are made off the multipliers being used and that's where you make your money, not off the .01 lot trades. Again, the whole concept with the martingale is to recoup the losses and put a little extra in your pocket.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Yep, and this is the part that people will have trouble visualizing.  Is one of the problems reporting in pips instead of profit, as 1000 pips for the week could equate to $10, $100, $1000 or $10k depending on your traded lot sizes.

If we assume you start with .01 lot on each progression, should be easy to determine how much actual money is being made with the system, using the pip results and multiplier given.

From my testing it seems EJ and GU have done the best and UC the worst

What is your experience?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi Mer071898.

I have problem with your indicator. After restart MT4 (due lost connection) was levels on different values than before. Is any solution for this?

Thank you for reply.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Lopuch,

interesting....

The box is drawn once the time is >= EndTime (07:00 or 06:00).

But the box INCLUDES the bar that is forming at that time.

On M15 charts, it means the box would include the bar formed between 07:00(included) and 07:15(excluded).

i think you started MT4 on the first pix DURING the LAST bar used to draw the box, and that last bar was forming and actually EXPANDING the box on the down side.

If you start MT4 AFTER that Last bar is completely formed, then this does not happen.

Which is what happened on your second MT4 reload.

Actually, this is an interesting issue:

the "EndTime" ("07:00" for instance) will actually "lock" the box only when the bar forming at 07:00 is fully completed, which happens at 07:15 on M15 TF.

Mer: the indicator box actually INCLUDES an extra bar: it includes the bar formed between 07:00 and 07:15, so the actual box period is 04:00-07:15 timewise, and not 04:00-07:00 strictly.

If we want the box to reflect price action between 04:00 and 07:00 strictly, then we should NOT include the 07:00-07:15 bar on M15 chart.

This may also cause box to change size when switching between timeframes.

for instance from M15 to M1.

So, the question is: should we INCLUDE or EXCLUDE that "extra bar" in the box computation ?

That does change quite a bit the results if the "extra bar" would actually expand the box.

Edit:

for my remark below: I was wrong, the latest version of Steve's EA computes the box size the same way as the indicator...

Sorry Steve, I did not update my EA with the one on post#1 lately

:-)

BTW, note that Steve's EA does not compute the box size the same way:

he EXCLUDES the FIRST bar, and INCLUDES the LAST EXTRA bar... which is even worth...:

Inserted Code //|           Steve Hopwood's London session breakout multi-pair.mq4 |
...
//Calculate the high and low
bhighest = iHigh(symbol, PERIOD_M15,
iHighest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, PRICE_HIGH, [color=Red]StartShift - EndShift, EndShift[/color]));
blowest = iLow(symbol, PERIOD_M15,
iLowest(symbol, PERIOD_M15, PRICE_LOW, [color=Red]StartShift - EndShift, EndShift[/color]));
While the Indicator does include the FIRST bar (AND the EXTRA also):

Inserted Code   double boxHigh = High[iHighest(NULL,0,MODE_HIGH,[color=Red](StartShift-EndShift+1),EndShift[/color])];
double boxLow  = Low[iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW,[color=Red](StartShift-EndShift+1),EndShift[/color])];

Hi Squalou

I have your v6.1 indicator on my chart with black back ground, it shows all the boxes as light blue even those bigger than 50 pips (or 500 for 5 digits), do you know what the cause might be

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Howard,

- the "MaxBoxSizeInPips" input is already in pips, whatever 4 or 5 digits broker you are using. 50 means 50 pips.

- check your inputs: is "BoxColorNOK" color Red ?

- check the actual box size on your chart: activate the "crosshair" mouse mode (press the mouse wheel), then hold-left-click on bottom of the box, and drag the mouse (keep left-click pushed) to the top of the box: next to the crosshair cursor you should see the "bar/POINTS/price" values: the "POINTS" is the number of "points" between start and stop of the mouse movement. For 5 digits broker it will show x10 the pip value (500 for 50pips).

If it's >=500 (or 50 on 4digs broker), then the box is betyond the limits and should show in red.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thanks a lot.

The problem was that I had set max size to 500(5 digit), changed it to 50 and red is showing now

--- 帖子 #422 ---
last 3 days have been extremely profitable for me. thanks mer and others. right now i am trading 7 pairs manually. placing orders for 7 pairs is time consuming. i downloaded the EA v5 and started using it in my demo account. i am facing some issues. its not closing the pending orders before next day box is started.  also i want to take multiple trades on same pair in both direction. i dont want the price to go into the box agin before crossing our entry price. whats the setting for this ? i am also confused on AM, PM trading hours 0-12, 12-24. what happens if i close my computer after the box is formed ? when i restart MT4 , does it agin place orders ? whats friday trading true/false ? can someone document these settings so that its helpful for others ?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Gbp/Usd is always going to be successful as this pair generally has the most volume in the London session. I feel pairs that have lower spreads but higher overall daily ranges fit the bill for this strategy, that's why Gbp/Usd and Eur/Jpy work so well. But you also have to have a little diversity as well utilizing several pairs to help with the drawdown. You may be trading only a couple of pairs and experience losses on both, which can hurt. But if your watching 5-7 pairs, the winners can help lessen the sting of the few losses you may have.

My thinking is this, the strategy requires the high and the low from 04-07:00, correct? So, if you need the high or low from the 04:00 candle, you're including the whole candle from 04:00 to 04:15, right? So, in order to get the high or low of the 07:00 candle, you must include the whole candle as well. Yes, you will have an extra bar because the price information is technically outside the box, but the box still drawn off that particular candle. Again, this is why we have adjustable inputs on the indicator, if you feel that it is more profitable to go from 04-6:45, be my guest. For my examples, I will be using the 04:00-07:00 setting.

I'm glad it's working out for you. I haven't been using Steve's EA so hopefully he may chime in or you can send him a pm with your question.

I also wanted to let everyone know that I have had a very informative chat with a fellow trader from another forum who is really into Fibonacci trading. He really loves the concept of the indicator and gave me some settings using a new entry point and Profit Target  to try out. I'll give you a little teaser, Eur/Usd would have made +183 pips on Thursday and Friday alone last week (with no multipliers!).

The Profit Target compared to the stoploss now provides a more appealing 1:1 RR and reduces the amount of whiplash compared with the tighter entries we're using now. Don't get me wrong, you'll still have some instances where we get our reversals off an entry point, but I am certain the returns should improve. I hope these changes will work out for the better, so let's keep our fingers crossed for now. More updates will come toward the end of the week.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
and the new settings are.....

For those who manually trade this startegy, I'm pretty sure you will love this pair...

V7 of the Indicator has the following improvements:

- shows "Profit Zones" in green (can be disabled by input)

- displays the box size in pips below the box, and a "NO TRADE" sign for red boxes;

- puts a chart-Comment on top left corner with the main settings so you instantly know what they are for that chart;

- sets system-wide GlobalVariables for use with the treat below...

Now, the treat:

I have modified Steve Hopwoods's "London Breakout script" presented on post #138 -- go read it to get the script basic usage.

This new script will take advantage of the improvements added in V7 indicator, so that you do not need to manually enter entry/TP/SL values anymore!!!

Here is how to use it:

-1- load the "London BreakoutV7.mq4" indicator (or higher version) on the chart;

-2- drag the script to the chart, and just click OK, that's it !!!

The script will automatically replace input values left to 0 with the corresponding entry/TP/SL levels for the BuyStop and SellStop orders that the Indicator has computed using your Indys inputs, so you don't need to manually input them.

You can use the script on charts open with different pairs each.

Use "F3" key to show the created GlobalVariables.

You can change their values directly there, these will be the ones taken by the script.

They will be updated automatically when a new box is formed the next day.

Isn't that nice, guys ?

yep, i'm happy to be helpful here, that enlights my day!

And yes, i'm now also trading this in a blink of an eye...

just drop-and-click-OK,

no more manual settings hassles,

move to next chart and repeat, and you're done for the day!

Well, you still need to keep an eye sometimes, just to re-drop-and-re-click once a trade has hit TP (or SL...) and return to your hobby.

Only an EA bot could beat that.

No time wasting, pure cream-trading!

Huge lost this month with this system.  Bad Luck or what?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I put V7 into custom indicator folder.

I put script into expert/script folder.

When i compile i got this:

Function "drawFixedLbl" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Normal?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks for this, really nice programming.

Does the script still execute if the box created is red?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Ignore it.

This is simply because that function is not (yet) used in the indicator.

So the "clever" compiler removes it, and pops a warning for doing that...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
yep, it doesn't bother about red/blue status, the variables are set by the Indy in any case, so the script will grab them.

I actually have it active on GY at the moment, although Red box status (57p on 04:00-07:00)

Sq.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Sorry this happened man... Been there myself too... Well... with different system, not this one.

Just got another 2 TP hit on todays breakout. That's 6 hit total today without losing a single one.

By the way, I used to trade with 10 pairs with this method. But now, I am getting serious with this system, so I am dropping 5 pairs away. I am picking my pairs by their movement pattern inside the London Breakout box and fibo. Some pairs just too often to get sideway (hit bothways too often) and some are just too slow. Some other I dropped for high spread risk.

My pick : GU, EU, EJ, UC, EG

Dropped:AU, GJ, UJ, EC and NU

Hope this help....

Patience young jedi, patience. I will probably let the cat out of the bag over the weekend after I see how the week goes using the settings.

Another incredible job squalou, especially incorporating Steve's script, thanks again for your work. As I said before, I will take the indicator and post it on page 1 and I will only put a single indicator (leaving on the version #) and template there so everyone will be on the same page. This way each of can make our own changes and use whatever parameters we desire to use.

Like I said to sangmane above, patience my boy.

I'm sorry your having such bad results, how many pairs are you using? Are you using the strategy with or without the multipliers? Are you sure your times are in line with your broker's times? Are you taking just one trade a day or all available trades? Ask yourself these questions and you mind find something out that your not doing or you may find a setting that's incorrect.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
My time is setup properly. I can compare your screenshots with mine and it's the same. I really dont have much time staring at the screen, every time the box is complete I setup the stops and forget. Then I just check the results by morning. I trade on all 5 pairs. GBPUSD,EURUSD,USDJPY,EURJPY, USDCHF.

I followed the system but I don't know why its not working for me. Once the stoploss is hit, I do not re-enter same position when it hits entry again.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Does not solve this problem using data from M1 TF in 15M?

(Ou - its Perfect script)

--- 帖子 #447 ---
There is nothing wrong with taking one trade a day. Are you using the multipliers when you have a loss? Even if you don't use my multipliers, you can use you own levels, although anything less than what I use may not recoup all of the losses, it will definitely help.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
well, you can always display the chart in M1 TF, and set the endTime to 07:14 (to keep the 07:00-07:15 data into the box, as Mer suggested),

so the box will still lock at 07:15, but what i will now call the "Lopuch glitch window" (if you would allow me  ), will remain open during only 1 minute instead of 15 minutes.

I'll try to come-up with a patch to that "glitch"...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I dont use any multipliers. I also do not use martingales. Thanks man! I'll try that tommorow. What currency pairs do you suggest bro?

I lost a little, but I wont stop until I get the correct settings. I am still in profit this week anyway with other signals I use.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I really don't have a preference except for making sure the spread is low. Pairs that have a larger daily range also helps.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
okay. thanks for the quick response. i'll look forward for a better trade tomorrow. Gotta rest! Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
The Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected, meaning the prevailing trends for all the majors will resume come London tomorrow. A little heads up for folks using the manual approach.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I am not so sure on that as there are questions whether or not Germany will pony up and bail out Greece. The euro is a complete mess right now as Greece and other euro countries have major questions.

Good morning mer071898,

first of all, thank you very much for sharing your work with others in this community here. I am rather new to ea and just started, my background is from FX Options trading (later FICC) and hopefully over the time i can make an input with regards to modelling quality by inserting indicators from that market........

I was just referred to your thread and wanted to do a quick learning by doing.....however I get some error messages immediately when the ea is firing up.

I am on a Alpari UK demo version and my computer time is GMT+1. I tried to work with all your default setups and get the following message:

pending long order send failed with error (130): invalid stops please try again

can you help plse? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Steve Hopwood is the creator of the EA. Any questions you have you'd be better off pm'ing him as I don't use the EA personally.

Hi mer071898,

I have been following you strategy for some 3 weeks now, and I must say what outstanding results.

I have been trading the following pairs:-AudUsd,EurGbp,EurJpy,EurUsd,GbpUsd,UsdCad,UsdChf,and UsdJpy.

Trading results:-47 wins, 15 neutral trades,1 Loss.

Total pips:- 1462 pips.

Absolutely amazing. Thanks for sharing your plan.

I cant wait to see your new fib level entry as promised.

Regards

Congratulations...

If everybody chose one pair that they thought was the most successful - which one would it be?

Is it better to place more on one pair than to trade five different ones with less?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi GannFan,

47 wins for only 1 loss ? AMAAAAAAZING !!!

That gives us an average +30 pips per trade !!!

You must be using some other SL method than the one called by the Strategy...

Do you move to BE once it gets well into the "sweet grass field" ?

And/or set a trailing stop ?

Would you share your SL method ?

If we can reduce the drawdowns to almost 0, we would have a killer Strategy here !!!

Not even talking about the long-awaited new settings that Mer is cooking us...

Hi Squalou... many ways to "cheat" this strategy to reduce the lose trade. Make sure you find one for yourself...  Not placing those stop at the same time is one of those "cheat". I think you owe yourself to play around a little...

You know what... I believe I also have read somewhere, that there is a guy out there who is putting 5 Lots on five pips in a breakout strategy similar to this one and he earn 315 consecutive wins without loosing a single trade (at least that was he said) . Have you notice how small 5 pips distance is in M15 TF with pair like EJ or GJ? Almost impossible to miss for me...

Like I said before... This Mer's work (now it's also yours) is already fantastic from the start... many ways to play, many ways to win and many ways for not losing. Just be creative...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Seems you had put some brain work to this topic.... what do you think, once you have found some suitable parameter, will they hold long?

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Some background thoughts:

We have all seen those days with huge Red "NO TRADE" boxes, and waaaaaaay too far TP levels...

and still, we feel like we could make some decent pips if those levels wouldn't be that far...

So, you just enter your own SL/TP in the script instead of all-0's...

Hum.... not very easy to come up with "reasonable" levels...

takes you ages and headakes with the calculator to get there...

Next, we all have a rough "feeling" of the TP "ceiling" that we should not exceed on a given pair... 60 or 70 pips max for GU perhaps ?

But the indicator nor the script will give you that ceiling...

Sooooooooooooo,

once more, Squalou gives you THE solution:

introducing the V8 "swiss-army knife" version of the indicator !

( i like that "V8", it sounds like a sweet Ford Mustang '68 engine...

this strategy may get me one some day !!

ok, back to the subject...

)

This version will allow to keep SL/TP levels into "reasonable" min/max limits on days with too-high or too-low pre-breakout volatility...

It has 2 more inputs acting as box size limiters.

Don't want your TP/SL levels go off the roof ?
Just set the "MaxExtentInPips" to whatever box size you don't want to exceed, and that's it.

And for those days where you think that the box is too small, and you could surely harvest more pips than what the tiny green strip suggests...

then just set the "MinExtentInPips" !

Of course, as usual, ignoring those values (default 0) won't change the behaviour of the previous versions indicator... just to keep you feel at home...

Ok, now, here are two cool extras for you:

- Tip#1: want to have a CONSTANT SL/TP arround the box median price, every day, whatever the box size may be ?
setting "MinExtentInPips" and "MaxExtentInPips" to the SAME non-0 value will get you there...
- Tip#2: want to set your "straddle" order based on a SINGLE candle, not on the 3-hours default box period ?
For instance, use the single bar formed at midnight as your straddle center ?

No problem:

set the startTime and endTime both to "00:00",

(that will give you tiny little boxes that do not even show on the chart!),

then set  "MinExtentInPips" and "MaxExtentInPips" so that you get a comfortable SL/TP "playground" (this is where "MinExtentInPips" is so important!), and you're done...

Now just drag scriptV2 on your chart and click OK...

Other changes i made: i fixed the  "Lopuch glitch window" issue...

And some other minor change.

You can read the full detailed version history in the .mq4 file directly.

Enjoy...

Unfortunately I can't be at the computer during a lot of the market hours.

Is there an EA that will do entry exit and stop loss? I realize I will have to input lot size and the pair traded.

Also my broker is Taduwal and they are gmt +2 , when i put the start and end time for the box I notice that I get a lot of red no trade zones, should I back it off to gmt+1 or leave it as it is set at 3-6 or move it for, 4-7

Thanks

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Just started playing a bit with my brand new V8-engine tonight...

got quite quickly a set of inputs that would have given 1300+pips in the past 60 days (from feb 4 till apr 29), on GU ALONE and just using the regular strategy rules (let loosers hit SL...)

It has a decent 2:1 Reward/Risk, and ended up with 65-wins/92-losses (not so good ratio yet...)

I can clearly see there is plenty of room for better tuning...

Pure cream...

I love my V8-engine already!

Mer, we are looking at some pretty good future here... thanks again for having started all this...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Sheppy, Steve's EA is listed in post 1, look into the thread for his posts, it has explanations for inputs.

It is multi-pair, you can set lots, and so many parameters ...

For the box, adjust the times (in broker time or your local time, i never know, they are the same for me!) so that they cover the 3 hours before London session Open.

I am also at GMT+2, and i shift Mer's 03:00-06:00 period is 04-07 for me.

another one ????  or......Should  I wait for V9? ...... which probably will be released tonight.

I just hope that you are not forgetting to harvest those pips everyday...

i attached the londonbreakoutv7 and scriptv2.. but when i attached the script. it pop ups an error. i have attached a screenshot of the error. can anyone help me?

thank you.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I keep getting that quite often too...

The reason is that you cannot place a BUYSTOP or SELLSTOP (="pending" orders) if the price is "too close to" or "already past" the order's entry price.

It is the case when price is in or near the green field.

Just wait for price to retrace outside the green field -- and it also requires some "safety margin" of several pips, perhaps 4 or 5 pips at least, otherwize the order is rejected by the server, and you get this message.

Can I ask which broker you are using for the charts shown on this page?

I use The Collective FX For all of my examples and results.

I plan on figuring up results this weekend to see how it worked out. I just don't want everyone to get too excited you know, we're not doing anything completely new, just different settings and possibly holding trades a little longer than we are now. I have more details up over the weekend

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Mer,

I believe an error was made on the math below.  5 X 30 = 300 or am I calculating wrong?

Also, curious if you have a more formal layout to analyze days and currencies separately like the request for a spreadsheet or one location for the results.

Seems like a great system thus far.

I am curious, you mentioned a 50K account, so to be 'safe'  using the Martingale, what would be your starting positions?  .01, .04, .1 etc..?

Thanks,

Blue

--- 帖子 #492 ---
No, you are correct. It is an addition error, but I was unable to catch it and edit it before the post was closed for editing, sorry.

If someone has the experience with spreadsheets, I'm all for it, but I'm totally a newb when it comes to anything that has to do with MS Office.

If you traded on a standard account where .01 lots = $.10 a pip and went up to say, 8 levels (.01, .02, .05, .13, .34, .89, 2.33, and 6.1). You would have 9.87 lots in play. My usual rule is no less than $10,000 for every 1 lot traded (based on 100:1 leverage). So, in reality, you should have $98,700 to be "safe" and 1/2 to 2/3 of that if you feel like taking a little more risk. If you are using a mini account (.01 lots = $.01 a pip) you would like to have $9,870 to be "safe". On mini account, you can lower that even more depending on what kind of leverage your broker can offer. This is general too rich for most but that should not deter you from practicing and making your own improvements like other have done to fit your own trading style.

This is not designed to be a system that will double your account every month and for those who are looking for such a system, please don't waste your time here on this thread because this is not what your looking for. It is more in line with 8-10 % a month, which is be more realistic to true trading results, ask any real trader. Now I can't offer any guarantees that you will not go past 8 levels, but I'll tell you this, I've never hit 2.33 lots yet in 6 months worth of visual backtesting.

Hi Sangmane,

Did you happen to ever recode the bot to work as Mer is doing things?  Wouldn't mind having it trading exactly how he is with the reentries, seems his method over the last 3 weeks outperforms the way your bot currently does it now.

Look forward to playing with if if u decide to edit the logic for reentries

--- 帖子 #499 ---
MER,

Check out docs.google.com and just publish it for all to see.  If you can figure out Metatrader and this system, than that will be child's play.    Only if you want to of course.  Also, you could send me the info and I can do it up online for you.

Per the Martingale, I have used a different # of systems for that.  With this system, if you are trading 5 currencies, then you need 500K in reserves and to make 50K per month (10%) then it doesn't seem to quite match up in my math with the current pips you are making.  I will study it some more and analyze the differences, but thank you for the explanation.  Just trying to nail this down a little more so I can decide to invest or not, but again, thank you for sharing your system!

Aloha,

Blue

In the 3 weeks results have been published to this thread, the total pip count for the original hours (4-7) is 4687, with highest level hitting 34

In the 1.5 weeks results have been published for the adjusted hour (3-6), the total pip count is 1897 with highest level hitting 34.

Adjusted hour has made 31 more pips than original so far in the 1.5 weeks, fyi.

If you were trading micro lots, this would equate to $0.10 per pip (or $468 3weeks/$189 1.5weeks)

guess it all depends on how much capital you really need to have in order to trade .01 starting lot.

Thanks to all in the thread.

Just to amswer a few ques. that have subsequently appeared:-

1.While i trade up to all the currencies that are mentioned, I dont necessirily trade all at one time.

2. The result shown are live accounts.

3.I use the basic description of the breakout. I.E. (as i understand it), When viewing the charts between the 3.00 -6.00am period I open 2 posiitions one long,&  one short on the 127% fib level after the 6.15 bar has finaised for the amount of the pip range of thr high /low for that period.

4. I use no more than a 35pip move.20-30 more preferable. Above that too big for my liking.

5. As my time of trading the 3-6 time frame occurs atapprox4.00pm in the south pacific I find that this is convient. Once the trade have been set I turn off the computer and gooooooooooooo. Its to tempting to watch and adjust (?) positions much to my determent.

6. The first week was a blitzer. Not only did the trend go in one direction upon completion and slighly over running the mark, it reversed , went back through the 1-100% fib range and then clicked me in on the otherside. 2 trades for for the price of one. This concerned me greatly.

7 Having that occur and the potential to turn a wining trade into a loosing one, I now do go back at approx 8-9pm to quickly review my position. If it is a winner I cut the other side out. If it is a looser than I allow it to run, Thereby (hopefully) turning a looser into a winner, which in my language is a neutral trade.  ( -1 + 1 =0)

4. I dont use the martindale method.

I hope this clarifies my view of the London Breakup a it was genoursly shared by Mer.

Thanks Mate.

Happy Trading.

Wonderful way to adapt this method to work in your favor, good job.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Alright, I know everyone is curious on the new setting that was given to me by my buddy on the "other" forum. What he has suggested on using is an "EntryFactor" of .8 and a "TPFactor" of 2.618.

An EntryFactor of .8 places the entry just past the 61.8 extension of the fib drawn on the box. According to my friend, who is a big fib fanatic, says that the 61.8 extension is a major hurdle when it comes to price reversals. If we can get a break of this extension increases our chance to get to our Profit Target. The TPFactor of 2.618 is basically the 261.8 fib extension of the box, a major target, especially when a 61.8 extension is firmly breached. This is nothing that is revolutionary or special as we still will have our losses mixed in with our winners.

Okay, how to handle open trades. Because we're looking at larger Profit Targets, we have to take a different approach to closing out the trades. What my friend has suggested is when you open a trade, leave it until it either your trade closes out at target or stops out. If you have an open trade from the previous day when the new box forms and you have another entry possibility, go ahead and enter as normal. Sometimes an open trade may take a day or two to close. This allows the trades to breathe and gives them time to develop. Some of the trades that we normally would have closed for a loss at the start of the box ended up as winning trades.

I looked over the charts over the last week and there are a few things that I noticed.

1) Profit Targets overall are a little larger allowing for more profit to be made. I have changed the maximum box size from 50 to 60 pips to allow for a few more opportunities.

2)  Comparing the Stoploss and Profit area (Green Box), we now have a 1:1 risk to return ratio. This may allow us to lower the multipliers that are used with the original settings. I'm sure the 1:1 RR should be more appealing to most everyone  here.

3) We are holding onto trades a little longer, so we'll  have the possibility of more than one trade open at a time on a single  pair. Trades that are not closed on Friday can now be carried over to the next week.

All of the charts examples of the new setting will be from my FXCBS broker which is GMT +3, which translates into an 06:00 to 09:00 entry time so no one gets confused. I'm using a different broker so I don't have to switch back and forth between profiles until I decide to merge it into my Collective profile. I'm trying FXCBS as the platform does not have a Sunday candle (I hate those!) and has excellent spreads compare to other ECN brokers.

I do not guarantee any results as this is only been visually looked over just on the past weeks trades. Please use common sense and look back through the charts or forward test on demo to make sure of the settings validity. I'll post some charts to show how I've interpreted the entries and exits.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
we will have fewer trades with this approach

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I would assume you would have fewer trades because you have a little farther to go to reach an entry point. But again, these are just optional settings for those who want something a little different.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is what I saw from Eur/Usd.

Keep in mind that red boxes are losing trades and blue boxes are winning trades. Same rules apply as with the original settings, 1) enter on the touch of the entry point and 2) no new trades entered after 00:00.

All trades are held until closed either at Profit Target or Stoploss. If we have a losing trade, the multiplier is figured in at the next available trade opportunity.

sangmane and Steve Hopwood are the two guys responsible for the EA's in this thread. I would suggest to PM them directly as you will get a quicker response that way.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hey guys,

First of all fantastic thread!

I was just wondering how on the charts you get say 22x2=44 pips.

Are the pending orders rejenerated or have you manually reentered for the second trade?

sorry for the newbie question!

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hey guys.

I wasn't around here last week - I was busy with the day job for the first part of the week then had some reflection to do about the other robots I am coding. I let my robot do the trading here, just adjusting the entry prices when the calculations were not quite correct.

Now I am catching up, I am blown away by developments here.

squalou, that is fantastic coding work. I love the latest indi; that script - wow.

I am going to adapt the robot's code to take the entry values from the global variables to overcome the difficulties caused by the internal calculations.

At some stage this week, I shall return to developing the robot and add the remaining functions.

Wonderful stuff happening here.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I thought you left us alone.....

Test your EA for this thread did produce invalid entry levels as you may have noticed.

Please consider (this, in fact was a tag line for Mitsubishi Motors in Australia many years ago. I like it very much.) what i posted in your the other thread:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=882

Thanks very much.

Cheers.

P.S. Sorry if i sound too demanding.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi Steve,

Thanks for the congrats, it goes right to my heart

I was about to start patching your EA bot to take advantage of my GlobalVariables-based "communication method" that i experimented with the Indi and script, but no time to do that...

I prefer to let you grow your own babies!

The EA taking the entries from the GlobalVariables would be nice, indeed:

- setup the Indi with your settings,

- fire the EA on the chart, and that's it.

However, some pitfalls may come with the EA, that should be adressed:

because it is a MULTI-PAIR EA, you must make SURE that ALL listed pairs have an open chart with the correct Indi setups on them, otherwize the GlobalVariables won't be defined, or will have wrong or outdated values;

A possible solution would be that the Indi "exports" ANOTHER set of GlobalVariables with its "last" SETTINGS when you drop it on a chart, e.g. "LB-GBPUSD-EntryFactor" (=0.3), "LB-GBPUSD-TPFactor" (=1.3), etc.,

so that the EA can use them instead of the LEVELS.

The EA would INVOKE the Indi code directly using the iCustom() function with these SETTINGS, and get the "returned" LEVELS from it thru the LEVELS GlobalVariables "updated" by the Indi.

At the stage, the EA doesn't require the Indi to be actively running on any open Chart, it is able to autonomously "determine" the levels by itself, day after day, on any listed pair.

The second advantage is that the EA becomes independent on the way the levels are determined by the Indi.

The EA becomes AUTO-ADAPTIVE to the Indi.

I have attached a V8.1 version of the Indicator with these new GlobalVariables for you to use in the EA  .

I have also attached a small script that demonstrates how to collect those global variables easily...
Just use the 2 functions in the EA.

Note that unfortunately GlobalVariables cannot hold text... so i trick the "time" strings a bit...

I think this opens a complete new perspective in EA coding!

My pleasure.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Steve,

just another thought:

i think it would be good to add the following input in the EA:

extern string objPrefix    = "LB-";

And use it when invoking the Indicator to grab the returned inputs and levels.

That way, we could fire the EA with "multiple Indicators" on the SAME pairs, each "set" of Indicators using a different "objPrefix" string.

For instance:

- a "London open" set with a box set to 04:00-07:00, endTime=14:00, with objPrefix "LB-London";

- a "NY Open" set with a box set to 12:00-15:00 (or whatever 3 hours prior to NY open), with objPrefix "LB-NY" for instance;

- and so on

You can actually already do that with the Indicator, it will show the 2 boxes and playgrounds, and set GlobalVariables with different names already ("LB-London-GBPUSD-xxxx" and "LB-NY-GBPUSD-xxx" in my example)

Then you can fire 2 EAs at the same time each with the objPrefix you want...

(on different charts probably, but we don't care! it's multi-pair anyway!),

Just a thought...

Sq.

Hi all,

I have been following this thread for the last weeks, and I am quite impressed with the developments made! Congrats to all!!!

I started using Steve EA last night on a micro account live but there are still issues with the EA to make it reliable on live trading.

a) second trades aren't happening when they were supposed to happen

b) some pairs choosen don't triger the buy/sell when they should happen

I suggest everyone to wait a little bit more so this issues can be addressed.

Congrats again for this fantastic work guys!! Results are indeed promising!!

EDIT: Looks like the issue is related to the broker where I opened this micro account... they demand the stop loss / take profit order to be minimum 20 pips away from PA (!!) so I guess this is the reason why EA gave errors and didn't trigered the new position when it should. Sorry everyone...!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
First off, when I say 44 pips (+22 x 2), it basically means the first trade was a loss and this trade used a multiplier of 2 to recoup the first loss.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi there... me again

with yet another script for you...

London Breakout scriptV3.mq4

As some of you asked, here is a version of the script (not the EA...) that will satisfy you, i hope...

It allows to open half of the trades with a TP target set at half of the TP, the other half open at regular full TP.

Each order is opened with half the input "Lot" (which now defaults to 0.02 so that it can be divided by 2).

So it will open 4 orders instead of 2 when using this option.

To enable this option, just set the "CloseHalfTradeAtHalfTP" input to "true".

Otherwize it behaves as usual.

Orders with half TP will use MagicNumber+1 to distinguish them from regular full TP orders.

Enjoy !

Sq.

I am converting the robot to be a single trading bot. This way, traders will be more easily able to customise its settings and use in light of their own personal preferences.

I shall still look at the other stuff as well; clearly I can learn from you.

Thanks again for your brilliant contribution. I have already rewarded you in the only way I have here.

The first thing I did when starting the conversion to single-pair use. Clearly a brilliant idea. Cheers again.

Hi Mer...thanks for the new setting, is there any particular pair that suit best for the new settings?

Squalou ...V8 is very good, thanks

Steve...i like that single pair idea

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hey Mer071898,,Great work!!

I like the new settings and think we are on step closer to those drinks..

I have a question on the Martingale and hold positions until the stop or target is hit.

In the chart below of the USDJPY on April 21st we had a sideways day and stopped out a few times...at the end of the day we have 8 contracts short.  The next day we get a BUY signal BEFORE the 8 contracts are stopped out.

Just wondering how you might handle this trade?  Do you take the lose on the 8 ctrs and go for 16 on the new buy signal?

Personally I may only take one trade in each Direction per day, per pair, ,,, if I am stopped out both ways then it is likely a consolidation day and best to wait for the next day.  If the first trade is a winner I am done of the day..

Thanks for your input,,,

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Well, don't get your hopes up yet, there's still a lot of testing to go before I'd put my money into it. As for which pairs work best, I'd have to stick with Gbp/Usd and Eur/Jpy. These seem to stand out a little more than the others to me.

You can go about it a couple of ways:

A) You could wait for the 8 lots to close out first, then place your next trade of 16 lots on the next valid entry, or

B)  If you get a signal before the 8 lot trade is up, treat that signal as if you're placing a trade after a 4 lot loss. So basically, you'd have (2) 8 lot trades open at the same time.

I think you're really leaving a lot on the table by just taking one trade a day though, but that is your call.

Hi Steve;

Having a single-pair bot is a good idea, indeed!

It makes it simpler to use for everyone, especially when you want different settings for different pairs.

I'd like to submit a request for the EA, that came from Danel01 (he cannot PM you yet), and lead to my scriptV3 with its "CloseHalfTradeAtHalfTP" new input.

Is it possible to add that kind of optional behaviour in the EA ?

I think you have it already implemented in the BS-10-a-day bot...

That would be a plus...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Will do.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hokay guys, this one is for the coders and testers here. It must not, not, not, not, be put on any live accounts - it isn't even going on mine and I coded it.

The multi-pair stuff is gone. The robot uses the figures provided by the fantastic LondonBreakoutV8 to calculate the trades etc. You need the indi running; it and the robot can go on the same chart, or they can go on separate charts for readability.

There are half-close, oco, max trades and max loosing trades features; play with them to see what works. I will squish bugs as they arise.

Coders, I have not actually removed any of the original code, merely adapting it and commenting out code that is no longer wanted. This makes it even more messy to read, but means I can backtrack easily if needed.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi guys

for those trading this manually I attach a script which is deleting ALL pending orders as soon as you drag it on a chart.

I goes in the experts/scripts folder.

Specially for those trading 10 pairs and having 8-12 pending orders open which are not needed anymore.

Hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Steve,

a great THANK YOU for this light-speed release of the bot!

It will definitely undergo "deep inspection" here

DxTrade, thanks for that script, it will help a lot indeed...

The only thing is that it deletes ALL pending orders on all pairs...

I have a similar one myself which only applies on the chart you drag it to, which will not cancel orders still pending on other pairs.

[edit:]

the line of code i have in extra compared to yours:
Inserted Code      if (OrderSymbol()!=Symbol()) continue; // delete orders on current chart only
[/edit]

My suggestion:

It would be good to have a "CancelCurrentPairOnly" true/false option perhaps.

Ideally a "KeepDualPendingOrders" option (or whatever good name you come up with) to keep both pending orders on the pairs that have not yet triggered any of the two legs (=still have both buystop+sellstop orders pending).

Just a thought.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi,

Have we got a time of day for cancelling pending trades?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
There were some bugs in the one-cancels-the-other code which are squished in this version. You will not have noticed them if you have OneCancelsTheOther turned off.

The half-close and move to breakeven appears to be working ok.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi there,

Here is bunch of small "helper" scripts for those who manually trade.

They are not tailored especially for the LondonBreakout strategy, but i found them pretty handy!!!

Designed for light-speed trading!

"_Buy@market" and "_Sell@market": instant buy/sell with SL/TP

"_Move TP" and "_Move SL":

drag the script on the chart at the price level you wish your new TP(SL) to be set, and it will change the buy/sell open orders accordingly.

I love those "magic" hints!

"_Move to Break Even": well... you understand what that means... it will include spread so you don't loose...

Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I just fired the EA on GU and EU with default settings, just updating the objPrefix to fit my current Indi, and use 2 different MagicNumbers just in case...

So, with OCO and half-close.

What is the "break even profit" input actually doing ?

GU fired buystop+sellstop right away

EU still not entered any trade as price is in the "grass" at the moment...

I wonder if it should at least try to place the "other side" pending order ? Well, it should fire both orders once it gets back into the "net" of the "tennis court"  ... we'll see...

Let's see what it will grab me by tomorrow morning !

And see if it updates the the orders when the new box gets formed in the morning...

I like where this thread is going....

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Here is version V9 of the Indicator:

- indicator Input parameters can now be dynamically modified by directly changing the input values in the system GlobalVariables(F3);

StartTime, EndTime and SessionEndTime can be entered as hhmm integer format (eg 700 for 07:00)

The Indicator will automatically redraw itself when it detects the changes;

The main interest of this version is that it will take advantage of the "London Breakout Input Calculator" script that is also posted here:

This script will compute the Indicator's Input parameters that reflect the MaxEntryDistance/MaxTP/MaxSL values that you input in the Calculator script.

- MaxEntryDistance: max distance in pips of buy/sell Entry prices from the MEDIAN PRICE of the Indicator blue/red box;

The typical max entry distance would be set to MaxBoxSizeInPips/2 taken from the Indicator Inputs;

- MaxTP and MaxSL: expected MaxTP and MaxSL in pips;

This is a more practical way of determining the Indicator Inputs.

The script automatically CHANGES the corresponding GlobalVariables(F3).

If you use Indicator V9, then it will AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE its input settings based on the new values computed by the Calculator script, and redraw the box and fields;

AND this will also make the EA AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE its settings as well!

So, the idea is:

-1- use the Calculator to setup your MaxEntryDistance/MaxTP/MaxSL levels;

-2- Indicator V9 and EA automatically adapt to the new calculated settings.

Please wait until the next EA version coming soon to take full advantage of these improvements -- the EA does not yet take into account the EndTime and SessionEndTime parameters; it will do soon!

Enjoy!

With Squalou's agreement, I am gracefully bowing out of coding the trading robot. Sq is going to take over this.

Sq has some fabulous ideas for developing the bot; by taking this over, he can accommodate changes in his indi within the robot.

We are going to finish up with a fantastic trading package here.

Ok guys,

Here is my first release of Steve's EA...

Steve Hopwood's London session breakout auto-trading robotV2.mq4

- it will stop trading and CLOSE ALL ORDERS at SessionEndTime set in the Indicator;

- it uses MaxBoxSizeInPips set in the Indicator: it will not trade on Red-Box days;

- OCO is disabled by default

- half trade TP is enabled by default

I have put the EA alone,

and a "full trading package" that includes everything, and some more...

Hello. thanks to all ya people and the author of this thread.

I want ask you. could you please add in this wonderfull script martingale system?

So i mean for example script put sell stop on Entry Sell and stp loss on initial Sell stop. And it put on initial sell stop reversal order with doubled lot and TP it put on Profit target of Buy order???

So i mean this function will be like you will name it MARTINGALE and i can put False ot True.

script is working perfect.

If you will have questions ask me I will draw.

Backtesting is NOTpossible with the EA...

Sounds strange, doesn't it ?

Teh reason is that the EA IMPORTS its entry/tp/sl levels from the Indicator's LATEST updated values.

These are only valid for TODAY.

Not for the past days, where the Box is set at other levels.

So..... no backtesting with this EA!

Only forward testing, ---- ON DEMO ACCOUNT PLEASE ---- !!!

There is a way of making the EA work on backtesting, though...

I'll let you figure out how for a little while...

You mean that martingale here is dangerous?

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Whooooaaaaaa!!!

If any of you guys already live with this system in last 3 days

And for some reason you choose to ignore those redbox and keep on trading,

Then you guys must be harvesting a serious amount of additional cash in your account by now......

To: Mer, Squalou, Steve, Sangmane and everybody who gave their time and contribution to this thread, thank you. Thank You. Thank You.

This system is already fantastic from the start.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Stace,

please post a picture of what you are talking about...

i am quite confused with your explanations...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
The author of this thread is also working with martingale as I understood.

Here is simple picture.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Stace,

So you are talking abou the regular martingale that Mer exposed in this thread ?

This has still to be coded in the EA, indeed.

I haven't looked into this direction yet.

But i'll be happy to share development work with anyone who would do it!

The multiplier follows a modified regular Fibonacci sequence: it takes 1 every 2 Fibo numbers if i'm correct:
1,(1),2,(3),5,(8),13,(21),34,(55),89,(144),233,etc.

The script could be modified to "remember" the current martingale multiplier into a GlobalVariable, update and use it, and save the new multiplier for the next trade. Reset to 1 on winning trade.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
YEs i talk about regular martin.

but your version is intresting. If you can do so in script it will be the best.

Sorry of course I will use EA you for tests. But in my forex career I prefer work by hands and scripts.

Is it possible to code your version and regular martini in this V3 script?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
And last one for today.

I have Alpari Russia broker. It is GMT+1 broker.

I see author also has +1 GMT Broker.

I have time in indicator V9 set as follows 04:00 - 07:00 But why I have suck small levels, the distance is so so small??

[quote=squalou;3703648]Stace,

1,(1),2,(3),5,(8),13,(21),34,(55),89,(144),233,etc.

Here is Code to start with;

In this example the array holds 7 multipliers, Can be more.

If(OrderJustClosedIsProfitable)

GV=1;

else

GV++;

GlobalVariableSet(LotMultiplier,GV);

// For Lot calculation

GV=

GlobalVariableGet(LotMultiplier,GV);

NewOrderLot=BaseLot*LotMultiplierArray[GV];

where LotMultiplierArray[]={1,2,5,13,34,89,233}

Just one way of using lot multipliers in the event of a loss trade

Pat

ArrayMultipliers[7]={1,2,5,13,34,89,233}

--- 帖子 #574 ---
stace,

you are using a TPFactor of 1.9 apparently, as i can see from the chart comment.

Which is already bigger than the 1.3 initial settings from Mer.

To make it bigger, choose higher numbers.

These factors are here so that you can experiment and choose whatever values fits you best.

Just play with them!

Sq.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
If(GV>MaxSteps )

{GV=MaxSteps;

// or whatever code for rules to follow upon losing a MaxSteps trade

}

When GV is used as a subscript, reduce by 1 since arrays are 0 indexed

Pat

Just an afterthoght.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Thanks.

So how about script?

with 2 versions of martini

--- 帖子 #577 ---
[quote=Pat1;3704010]
Hayaaaa!! the coding contest is starting already ???

Thanks Pat for the input.

I was thinking of using a "real" fib sequence generator function, so it is not limited --, but well,  actually who would want to end-up with a LOOSING multiplier of 4181 after 9 consecutive loosing trades...??

The array idea is good.

We'll have to ask Mer why he did choose those 1-every-2 fib numbers...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
[quote=squalou;3704214]
Because he does not want to break even only (according to his money) but he wants to make money...

Imagine we would take every Fibnumber - that would mean:

1,(1),2,(3),5,(8),13,(21),34,(55),89,(144),233,etc.

After risking 1R we would risk 1R again on the next step --> almost break even but while risking 2R we will not only recover our losses but gain some nice Pips extra...

Another example - imagine you have reached number 13....

With every FIB you lost 1+1+2+3+5+8 = 20R and gain 13R = all in all you lost

With every 2nd FIB you lost 1 + 2 + 5 = 8R and gain 13R = all in all you win

--- 帖子 #579 ---
good point, Nightyhawk, thanks.

however, the issue with those fibs is that the steps are quite big.

If you trade 0.1 lot at first (that's only 1$/pip on EU), then it becomes rapidly 34$/pip, after 4 losses.

And you can get 4 losses quite quickly when market is slow and ranging... if you strictly follow the strategy...

That makes me unconfortable using martingale...

You need to have deep pockets to sustain the losses before you get your money back (and more, granted).

Sq.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Okay guys, I'm back in full force!  Let's try and catch up a little.

First off, I'm sorry to see you bow out Steve, but always know you are welcome back anytime you want.

I have added the zip file to the first page. Just a thought squalou, you may want to put some sort of instructions in a PDF or Word doc in there to help explain the indicator, script, and calculator functions so people don't have to search through the whole thread for how to properly use them.

I'd love to see this added as well, that's the only reason I'm not using the EA yet myself.

Alpari Russia is actually GMT +2 in the summer so you should actually have the indicator set to 05:00 to 08:00.

nighthawk hit it on the head. My goal is to make money off the loss, not to just breakeven. But again, you could always add a Martingale True/False input to the EA and allow a person to choose their own individual lot sizes for each level. That way if someone doesn't like as much risk, they can lower the lots. It may not recoup all of the loss but it will definitely lessen the pain.

Yes, but there are those out there that do have deep enough pockets and we need to make sure that they are able to use the full functionality of the strategy in which the EA should match that. Again, maybe an option to turn it on or off as needed. We're not always looking to double our money, some of us just use the larger account size as a buffer and look for residual monthly income off the trading.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Not bowing out mer, but Sq's coding skills are awesome and his range of ideas fantastic. As he has coded the indi, it makes sense to hand over robot development to him.

I am still here, and making pips (usually) out of your wonderful trading system.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
I have another LiteForex broker. They have now GMT+2 Time. So on mine Alpari I have difference with Liteforex one hour back.

So Alpari is GMT+1 now.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I am really sorry I cannot understand your martingale style.

Could you please explain how you are facing with loosing trades working with martingale.

+20x13 what it means.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I don't know what to tell you. I confirmed that info through Alpari's live chat and they said they are on central European time which is GMT +2 in the summer and GMT+1 in the winter. This also explains why your chart is 1 hour behind mine.

A multiplier is just what is states. If you start with .1 lots as your starting lot size, you increase the lot size after a loss by the next multiplier. So by saying +20 x 13, it means you would have made 20 pips x 1.3 lots (.1 x 13)

--- 帖子 #585 ---
hi everybody! why don't we add a function to decide the lot size as a % of the accountbalance?

i'm using this kind of mm in my trading... let's say that the box size suggest a maximum loss of say 45 pips, we could code a function that says: ok if u want to loose max say 1% of your account u should use xx lots...

clear?

this is actually the way i trade: i decide my sl position, and the % i'd be ready to risk, then i calculate the right lot size...

it should be quite easy in our case too as we know, day by day, the maximum loss in pips.

martinguale would be also possible considering the % instead of the lots!

so if i risk 1% in the first breakout, and it goes bad then for the second i'd risk say 1.5%!

i'll post some code lines tomorrow morning as here in italy it's night and i'm quite asleep!!

this is how i would really use the ea because as i trade the session start i've no time to do all the calculations manually for this breakout!

ps i am the first that would like a pdf explaining all the stuff and in particular how to set the gv and the ea!

good night everybody and..... tons of pips to the asian session's traders!

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi Guys

This thread has moved on so fast from original concept that it can get a bit confusing which indicator version to use with which ea version etc. etc.

Could we have a pdf document explaining latest indicator and ea and how to set them up and all the different functions . For example I have the london breakout indicator version 7 on my charts which am happy with, can I use latest ea by sq. with this or do I need version 9?

Geoff

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi Squalou

Thanks for your great contributions to this excellent thread.

I have just installed your latest EA and indi v9. The on screen words tell me that we are closed but I have just had 2 pairs start taking trades!! It is currently 11.45pm GMT and everything should be asleep (except those of us who hang off the other side of the world in Australia!!).

When I try to load the indi (V9) I do not get the drop down input box nor does it register that I have installed an indicator. I have done this hundreds of times but I must be doing something wrong. Does the EA make the indi redundant - if so, how do I get the trading time to input?

Sorry to be such a klutz but I am confused.

Regards Karl

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Attached a pic of one of the charts that indicates that the EA is trading - well outside the trading period. I have Expert Advisors switched off to stop it trading. Thought it might help. As soon as I switch the Expert Advisor tab on, it sends pending orders and in one case, opened trades. I have 8 charts operating and 2 of them are doing this. The other 6 charts are saying 'Not trading'.

Strange!!??

--- 帖子 #589 ---
The Market surely went crazy last night..

Hope you guys was there harvesting Pips.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I agree, I think that adding it through % vice a hard fib number makes more sense.  If you look at your fib numbers they are typically 2.66% or something like that (fib number) after you get up to a few lots..

I believe 2.66 as a multiplier is very dangerous for ANYONE.  (that is your choice though)

This is a mechanical system and odds are in your favorite, however, could you go 13 times to failure?  Do you want to find out?

In my opinion, why not break even and get it back to 0 or enable the EA to do such as I believe most people would feel much more comfortable with that.

Unless you have a 1M account and bet .01 lots, then it makes sense.  I haven't met to many of those people through this forum.    Then why bet .01 just so you can use the Martingale...?  hmmm.  Such an interesting topic.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Mer

Are you planning to post charts for this week's trading now that you're back?

P.S. sorry to hear about your family troubles

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Look, please nobody take offense at this but I'm tired of saying that I choose to use the martingale because I have the capital to to so. If you don't like to use martingale or like using my specific multipliers, don't use them! I said this strategy is just a base, so build it to suit your trading and your money management. I include both ways in my charts to show the good and the bad of utilizing the martingale to be fair to those who are interested in applying it.

Thanks taz, I appreciate the comments and concerns from you and everyone else here. Don't worry too much as the problems are getting resolved and it was really nothing super serious, just more of an inconvenience. With regards to posting charts for this week, I will probably not post charts this week as I am behind and trying to catch up with other business and I'm really pressed for time this week. I will probably start up fresh on Monday, that way I can study a little more on how the new settings are behaving. If you have a question on a particular pair, let me know.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
One of the very reason I stopped posting my comments was MM and I see this coming over and over again. This probably means that indeed, this is a valuable point to discuss. So after following the thread (thx for the breakout Mer), here is what I meant to share earlier on:

First of all, I have nothing against Martingale ... actually I like Martingale ... but martingale means you have 2 random variable, same distribution, same expectation .... what the hell does this means ..... typically, that the behavior or losing or winning is similar. Well .... NOT in our case. And why is that ... because although (let's say) you have a 50% / 50% chance of win/loss, the behavior of it (its amplitude in our case) is never similar from one try to another BECAUSE it depends directly on the Breakout BOX Size .... (and saying that the box size has a normal distribution would be attributing a gaussian behavior to the market action .... do not even go there !)

So, focus on what you want: recoup loss and eventually (up to you), make some profit.

Well, instead of randomly multiplying lots taking into accounts only the number of consecutive losses ..... determine the number of lots to enter a trade following losses by:

1. determining the amount ($$) lost

2. determine the nb of lots to recoup this $$ amount BASED on the Take Profit (as "difficult" as determining a SL = % equity ... as everyone knows you don't enter a trade with the nb of lots you want to make a win, you enter with the number of lots you are ready to loose .... typically 2% .... traditional MM with various mathematically correct explanation behind it)

3. Add a little extra if you want

... Mer, I know you slam everyone questioning martingales ... but sit down 2 sec and think about this scenario ... first loss of 10 pip, second loss of 10 pip, third loss of 10 pip ... mutiplier 13 .... but no chance this time the box size is 50 .... SL is thus 50 .... do you want to risk loosing 650$ to actually recoup 80$, where a multiplier of 2 would have been enough to actually recoup your loss and add a 20% benefit.

I have coded everything you said in an EA, with re-entry (at bounce and at break-out as suggested by Sangman .. which I like better), I have coded both "recoup strategy" ... and recouping with the latter (which mathematically makes more sense) is better, at least to my standards.

Furthermore, when backtesting the strategy ... didn't everyone ever observe that, sometimes, even when applying Mer Martingale ... some loss would not be recoup .... well what I explained earlier is exactly the reason .... loss 1 at SL=40, loss 2 at SL = 30 (30x2), loss 3 at SL = 40 (40x5): total loss = 40+30x2+40x5=300, win 4 at TP = 20 (x13) = 260 .... and the result is ..... -40 (not accounting for spread) .... even with a multiplier of 13 ! That happened in February this year on FXCM datasets at least if I remember well.

Now for the sake of the conversation, when using Mer martingale multiplier strategy, I believe it would be safer to do as previously suggested .... take only 2 positions max per session in two opposite "loosing" positions, stop there, and call it side-ways ... better chances tomorrow.

Finally, let these price actions fly without cutting trades short at TP. A Simple QQEA would do it .... I'm sure Squallou can make everyone happy with this.

That's everything I have in my EA from the strategy detailled by Mer. (about 50-60 lines of code thanks to the well written indicator provided by Mer ... the very first version ... I did not used the newer one yet)

if there is some flaws in my reasoning please let me know. I always appreciate learning from my mistakes. that's the only way not to make them twice.

XmPh.

No offense my friend, ppl are sharing their views around your excellent strategy. Everyone is thankful for you to share this.

Eventually, there might be some good at listening to other ppl, and you might even end-up making more money.

Martingale: 2 random variables, same expectation, same behavior (distribution) ... not in our case. There is nothing wrong at applying correctly and purposefully a martingale. But what you propose is a "recoup+gain multiplier strategy" (for which I have no mathematical explanation considering the very nature of the Box strategy).

Maybe an appropriate solution would be to start a MM thread parallel to Mer BreakOut Thread. Would that be an interesting Idea? That way, Mer you would not be "upset" or "bothered" anymore. And other ppl could discuss one aspect of this strategy (the MM) in a friendly environment .... and eventually Mer, you'll come some time and glance at this thread.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I don't want you to ever feel that you can't express your opinions and make valid points. I encourage those who do.

Come on, I don't slam anyone who questions using martingale. What I do is I stress that this is what I use and if you want to use a different martingale sequence or not to use it at all, fine. I will never force anyone into believing that the martingale I use is the only way to do it. I use it because I have the capital to effectively use it and it satisfies my needs and it does what I need it to accomplish.

I am and have been fully open to this idea. If the EA was intelligently coded to take into consideration the total sum of all the losses and calculate the number of lots needed to pull a profit based on the new Profit Target, I'm all for it. Because I'm a fairly aggressive trader, I don't believe in just breaking even, that is a waste of my time and it should never be your goal to just breakeven off of a loss. Granted, it is more difficult, but nobody said it wouldn't be risky.

But doesn't that say something when you have to go all the way back to February to find that example? I never said that the sequencing is perfect, you'll run into situations like that on occasion, it's the nature of Forex trading and this is not the holy grail by any means. just consider how bad it would've been without the multiplier.

Trust me, there are no flaws in your reasoning, but it's just one person's opinion against another and no one is really wrong here. It's all about what you prefer to use or not use. The whole thread was not about the martingale, I just gave everyone another option to build off of.

That could turn into an excellent idea. Do I really come across as being "upset" or "bothered", if so I don't mean to sound that way. I am just trying to control  the thread so it doesn't get too confusing for all (hard to do, I know).

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hi guys,

so, the EA discussion is getting really interesting here!

Here were my initial plans for the EA extensions:

- move to initial BE(+spread) when half-TP is hit: this is something that will make people more confortable;

let second half develop with that new secured SL;

Steve coded this extension in his latest version, so the EA already does that with the half-TP enabled; it even locks-in BE+BEProfit actually;

- when full-TP is hit, RE-ENTER with limited SL, and TRAIL it;

this will allow to catch the continuation;

Re-entering is needed, as the order hitting the TP is then closed;

If price retraces, then we still have locked-in the higher SL -- which may be lower than the original TP if price retraces just after having reached the TP, but that's still a good positive trade!

If price flies away as it did so often these past days, then... you'll just make more pips, i'm affraid!

(and i can tell you it has worked pretty strongly lately!!)

We can discuss the trail distance -- it will be an input anyway;

what would be a good default value ?

- add martingale option;

although i'm not confortable with it, i understand people who want to use it; it will be added to the EA some day, but that was not my first priority

@ xmph : would you kindly share the "re-enter at bounce and at break-out" code you have coded ? Just to save us (& me!) this hassle...

I don't mind if you even post the full EA here

I'll be off for the week-end, digesting the 1100 pips (without martingale!) on yesterday's GJ pair (don't ask me what settings i use )

Thank you Squalou,

Just test the EA & V9 and its open trade accordingly.

Curious before why its say Finished For Today as i set maxtrade allowed = 2

When i change to 4 then  Trading appears...

My setting

Entry Factor : 0.4

TP Factor : 1.1

Period : 0:00 to 7:00

and found it good at GBPUSD, but the Risk Reward is 2:1 ...hmmm

--- 帖子 #604 ---
hummm....

i think this has to do with the EA working all night long.

EA does not cancel yesterday's buystop/sellstop orders when the new box forms...

I shall look into that...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Looks like the "Local time" has to do with this behaviour...

The EA settings indicate "Local Time 15:52", and your trading hours are set to 01:00-18:00, which makes local time in the trading range.

The Indicator uses a different time comparison method.

That's the reason.

I will make both use the same time functions, so they are consistent.

I don't notice it on my charts because local time and broker time are the same for me (GMT+2)...

As you can test this i cannot, can i ask you to try this change in the EA and see if that fixes the issue:

replace the following line: (line 709):

Inserted Code       int now = TimeHour(TimeLocal())*100 + TimeMinute(TimeLocal());
with this one:
Inserted Code       int now = TimeHour(Time[0])*100 + TimeMinute(Time[0]);
This works just as fine with me here, but might fix it on your side.

Thanks for the report, this will definitely improve EA<>Indicator reliability !

if someone can give steps, that would really help

--- 帖子 #609 ---
stace,

Yes, price needs to be between the green fields to open orders properly.

Attached is scriptV3.1 that will open LIMIT order instead of STOP order in this condition.

Hopefully this will fix the issue!

Sq.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Here is  a "quick starter-guide":

-1- open the indicator on the chart you want to display it;
- setup your input settings as you wish (time, etc), click OK;

-2- manual trading can be done using the scriptV3.1:

(V3.1 i just posted fixes the "invalid stops" error)

- drag the scriptV3.1 to the chart;

- leave inputs to 0 if you want the script to use the values setup and exported by the indicator;

- click OK;

- the script should open pending buy+sell orders (limit or stop orders)

- when a TP or SL is hit, then you need to reload the script if you want to re-enter for a new game ("insert coin"  );

- CAUTION: when TP or SL is hit on one order, the other one doesn't get cancelled -- this is not an automatic EA, but a one-shot script, remember!

- if you want to stop trading ("game over"  ), use the "_Delete_Pending" script to cancel the remaining pending order(s) (drag it to the chart).

-3- automated trading requires the EA:

- start the EA AFTER having setup the Indicator in -1-;

- it will trade according to the settings;

- let go and watch the show!

- don't forget to Enable Experts in MT4;

I might come with some kind of instructions doc later.

Here is an updated _Delete_Pending script that will delete ALL pending orders on the current chart.

If MagicNumber input is 0 (default) it deletes all pending orders for the displayed pair, REGARDLESS of WHICH CHART IT IS ON -- be careful when having multiple charts on the same pair with different pending orders.

Otherwize you can specify the MagicNumber on which it will apply.

The previous version i had wrapped in the zip package would miss orders if multiple pending orders where present (you needed to run it multiple times).

Hi XmPh,

Can you explain more detailed about the use of QQE in this strategy? Maybe one or two charts will be great

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Mer,

The comment was made to enable it through the EA, not to guide anyone's specific trading.  To each their own, but having that flexibility would be nice within the EA.  Please don't take it as criticism or anything of the sort.  Your system derived from other breakouts is the best that I have seen as I am a big believer in fib's as I trade them daily.

--- 帖子 #614 ---

Thanks SQ. I have accused Steve H of being a machine but you are just as prolific!! You guys are terrific and so generous with your time. I am sure I speak for everyone when I say how appreciative we are of your efforts.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Question for Mer and the community:

the last change to the script (V3.1) attempts to "fix" the "error 130: invalid stops" issue by sending a LIMIT order instead of a STOP order when price does not allow for a STOP.

This is so we still have our 2 pending orders, wherever is price when you fire the script.

I was about to include that change in the EA too...

However, having followed the behaviour of my beta release of the EA with this change on friday, i'm not so sure that this is the way to go...

LIMIT order will fire as soon as price RETRACES to the limit price.

But price is actually crossing the limit in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of what the normal STOP order is used for.

Meaning that we may end up going straight to SL if price continues his way.

This is probably not what we want!

Price would have to turn arround again before hitting SL to get into the right direction.

Any thoughts on that Mer ? Anyone ?

Before i put that into the EA...

Sq.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Ah, I'm glad you brought that point up.

My own thoughts are that it would be best for buy & sell stop orders to be placed, only when price retraces back into the blue zone (between high & low) of the 3hrs running up to Frankfurt open).

For instance, let say we have a succesful sell order, that hits its target and then price heads north again. I believe at the moment, as soon as price hits the initial sell order price, it will open a new sell order. Is that correct ?

If my understanding is correct, would it not be better to only open 2 new pending orders once price has made its way back into the blue zone. That way if price continues upwards, we do not face a sell trade SL on the way. If price were to head south it will trigger the sell stop order on the way down.

Anyway, just my own thoughts.

My thanks go to your good self and everyone involved for all your very hard work and dilligence.

Hello boys.

I am using Idicator V9.

So right now i am waiting for levels to be appeared.

SQUALOU

Hello. I use Script V3.1, works fine.

I am wondering is there any possibility to make when I use CloseHalfTradeAtHalfTP after first target is hit script put second order stop loss to Break Event?

Right now mine first target on EURJPY is nicely hit and second order I moved stop loss to BE by hands.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
'

i use the v9 of the indicator..  the breakout time had already past but it still did not draw the box. why is that?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
can you explained it to me? i have also the problem.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I dont know, after 15 minutes box was drawn.

that why i canceled my question.

can you post image of your situation and what broker and what GMT time broker has?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi,

As Mer explained in some posts, the box INCLUDES the bar that is starting to form at the "EndTime".

Meaning that:

on M15 chart, with EndTime set to 07:00, the box will draw at the END of the 15-minutes bar starting at 07:00, so it will draw the box at 07:15.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Stace,

this is a SCRIPT, not an EA

SCRIPTS eexecute only ONCE, AT THE TIME YOU RUN IT.

You have to move BE manually when using the script.

This is also known as "MANUAL TRADING"

Sq.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
that is not the case with my chart though. its past 2 hrs since the breakout box should be drawn. even with i reload it to the chart it doesnt draw ..btw, i attached the indicator together with the ea.. all the latest releases.

i think it has something to do with the broker time. see my attached image below.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
if the range is very high and beyond box, i dont think box will be drawn. today for some pairs no box

--- 帖子 #638 ---
if the range is high, depending on your setting. mine is max 50 pips. then it should still draw a box. but with the red color.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
It was my understanding, that the ea would send new limit orders after a successfully closed TP trade had occurred.

My GBP USD long closed at TP 20 minutes ago, but new limit buy order has not been made.

Anyone else ?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Guys...

troubles trading on mondays ?....

Can you zoom out your charts and tell me if this happens all ALL mondays on your charts ?

I get the same result if i set my box to start at 23:00 and end and 02:00 for instance, ie when it has midnight INSIDE the box.

I think it has --again-- to do with broker-vs-local time...

I think we should remove the line 251 in IndicatorV9:

Inserted Code     if (TimeDayOfWeek(tBoxStart)==0) return; //don't show saturday; sunday=0~saturday=6;
It fixes it on my charts, so please try it and feedback on the result, so we can update the indicator ASAP.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
nicely done squalou..your the man!

this solves the problem. thank you.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
So...

Here is the fixed version of the Indicator for the "monday-morning issue".

* V9.1: [Squalou]

*     - "monday-morning fix": box wouldn't draw on mondays when the box time includes midnight

*       (local time 00:00 is between StartTime and EndTime, for instance 23:00 - 02:00).

Re Post 605

Hi Sq

The solution posted in #605 appears to be working thanks. I won't know for sure until the trading period is complete to see if any trades are then entered.

Out of the 6 pairs I am trading, only 2 boxes are within the max box size. I am looking at increasing the box size to 80 and then watch the results. This will bring 6 charts into a trading position.

Based on what I stated earlier, and to which you are open, and to stay as up-to-date as possible:

EUR/USD, april 13th:

Traditional method as introduced by Mer: 4 loss in a row ... meaning opening fifth at "times 34" based on post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&postcount=79

for the 4 losses: SL = 43pips

for the win: TP = 17pips

(on FXCM historical datasets - refer to picture attached)

Now What I did is account for each loss, and each time I'm opening a new trade, I try to recoup+X% of amount to recoup (summation = summation +X%) .....

breakeven +30% of RecoupAmount = 0.79lots are required

+20% = 0.70lots ...

+10% = 0.54lots ...

+5% = 0.50lots ...

+0% = 0.47lots ...

Mer, considering you have a multiplier of 34 after the fourth loss you are short 0.13lots if my math is right.

I leave the comments and interest to you Mer. I like your breakout. I'm posting this for you as a "thank you for giving us this nice strategy". Now, if after this you don't switch to another MM, then at least I would be convinced I did my best to "repay" what you gave us. You can PM me if you have further questions to not "pollute" the thread (I do understand you need to prevent noise from your thread .... however I believe such MM is relevant to ur strategy don't you think)

PS: I'm trading this live .... @+30% (but I'm guaranteed to break-even and make profit each time) .. come on ... I had to say it ;-) no harm

Squal,

Can you cast your eyes over this one, see what you make of it.

Had the EA working on a number of pairs yesterday. Had it set to close everything out at 16:00 GMT. With time coming up to 16:00 there was only one pair left with an open trade - the USD JPY.

The EA sent an order to close the trade at 16:00, but according to the log, it failed due to invalid prices. I therefore closed it out manually shortly after.

This morning the EA sent pending orders to re-open USD JPY trades based upon yesterday's box and also sent them at the open of the 6.00GMT candle. All other pairs have reacted as they should have and opened pending trades based on today's box at the close of the 6.00 GMT candle.

Would manually closing out a trade after "trading hours" have caused this ? If so, can the code be altered to re-send the closing orders at close of play for the day, to avoid the situation described.

All the best

Stu

Good morning everyone, I see we've had some interesting developments, conversations, and fixes. I appreciate everyone's work and I apologize for not being present more over the weekend. I've updated the zip file in post #1 with all the new updated scripts and indicators.

A couple of things before I start with putting up any charts. With all of the discussions and charts that have been  posted, I'm pretty sure everyone has the concept down by now. Tonight, I will move away from the original settings to focus on updating chart results using the new settings I mentioned in post #506. I will also be adding a couple of new charts, Gbp/Jpy and Gbp/Chf, as I believe these two pairs with their larger daily ranges will benefit from the new settings. The only real difference besides the Entry point and Take Profit is I've moved the Max Box Size to 60 pips on all pairs except for Gbp/Jpy which I've set to 80 pips.

xmph, I believe you are onto something very interesting here. This is the kind of logic I would love to see in the EA. It gives the trader a little more confidence in trading and being able to make money instead of just breaking even. I know how trying to incorporate any type of martingale can make most, if not all, traders nervous as they are less likely to risk their own money if there is even a hint of a blow up. Your concept allows less risk and still allows us to put a little money in the bank, which is the whole goal of trading, good job. Now incorporating that into an EA, well that's a challenge that will have to be up to sqaulou. If the EA would be able to calculate what it would take to recoup our losses with what you've described here, even after several losers in a row, I think a lot of people might look at this strategy in a whole new light.

In the meantime, maybe someone with some skill in doing spreadsheets can make a calculator to help figure out the lot sizing for those of us in the thread that are still trading this strategy manually.

Al right....

After a few hours of coding and intense unit testing, i came up with this new

V3.0 version of the EA...

The main new feature, that EVERYONE was waiting for:

!!!!!!!!!!! BACKTESTING IS NOW POSSIBLE !!!!!!!!!!

Yes, i'm not kidding...

It now imports SETTINGS values from GlobalVariables set by the Indicator, which are used to compute the box and levels by itself every day (and therefore while backtesting)

(instead of just importing the LEVELS, which are only valid for the present day).

I also fixed A LOT of bugs in various areas (OCO, half-close, invalid orders, etc)

Hope you won't be bugged with error Alerts anymore...

Alerts are now USEFUL ones, when opening trades or changing SL/TP values, etc.

So at least you know that the EA is still alive...

Now hopefully i can concentrate on the new features without "noise" :

- trailing stop,

- Money Management (Risk settings)

- MARTINGALE!

- Mer's new "keep open trade running after SessionEnd" rule; (but delete pending ones!)

Hope you'll all be happy with this one!

Sq.

Detailed V3.0 changes:

* V3.0: [Squalou]:

*       ========== ALLOWS BACKTESTING THE EA ==========

*     - the EA now computes the Entry/TP/SL LEVELS by itself, and only imports Indicator SETTINGS

*       from the GlobalVariables.

*     - EA now starts trading at the END of the bar forming at the Box EndTime, as expected by the Strategy:

*       on M15, with EndTime=07:00, EA will start trading at 07:15, not 07:01.

*     - fixed recursive alarms playing when price goes out of the "green fields";

*       Only valid pending STOP orders are now placed based on market price;

*     - Fixed OCO function that was repeatedly trying to delete wrong orders;

*     - fixed count of losses for the day: when EA was used on multiple pairs/charts,

*       ALL running EAs would "stop trading for the day" when the FIRST one reached MaxLossesAllowedPerPair...

*     - fixed Half-close not functionning on SELL side;

*

Please feel free to rename it. I am just delighted to have started something off that looks to have some pretty strong legs due to your incomparable contributions.

Cheers sq. You are fantastic. Good to see your voucher count rising - told you there would be more on the way.

Sq, Mer and others,

My set-up includes what Mer explained us in the firth post + leaving trade alive + MM as I stated it (I also have Mer MM) + as many trades as it can until 23pm each day whether on bounce or on breakout.

So far, on a SINGLE pair, I do not have any satisfactory results unless I start with an account size of 20k, risk loosing almost 10k to finally have a total benefit of 700$ from Jan till now.

Mer, is there anything else to your strategy, that you would think of or do, and that was so normal that you didn't explain ? Do you think that trading simultaneously multiple pairs even out the bad days of others ?

I will investigate number trades / session, nb loosing trades / session, taking only bounce, only breakout, both, max loss/day and so on, and let everyone know.

Thx.

RRRrrrrrrrrrrr..........

i think i got the bad "bug" down....

i "forgot" to put back a change i made for unit testing.

That keeps happening, eventhough i always use my favorite compare/merge tool before releasing.

This time there just was too many "detail changes" for me to spot that little one.

So here it is:

the "objPrefix" input default value has turned into "LD-" where it should be "LB-" as it always was...

Please set it back to "LB-" in the EA.

This little "detail"" is capital to make the EA grab the correct set of input values exported by the Indicator (which uses "LB-" default prefix).

Can you try that ?

Now that we are talking about this "small detail of importance":

you can use that capability to actually run the EA on the SAME pair with DIFFERENT Indicator settings.

You should ALSO use DIFFERENT "MagicNumber"s on both EAs so they don't "interact".

Setting up the Indicator AND the EA with the SAME objPrefix and MagicNumber gives you a "trading profile".

Now you can setup multiple "trading profiles" by changing the objPrefix on BOTH the indicator AND the EA.

Just save each "trading profile" as a "set" with MT4, so you can easily reload this "set" that i'm calling a "profile" here.

Then you can load one set on ane chart, and another set on another chart of the same pair, and both EAs will use their "private profile" without interferring with the one another.

I do actually use that on my side (hence the omission before releasing)....

If that solves your problems then i will release this fix ASAP.

(with an additional assert check so you won't run into that one again without knowing why...)

Sq.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Yep, that fixed it, Cheers Squal

--- 帖子 #665 ---
My impression is that you MUST use it on MULTIPLE pairs if you want to counter the losses on a given pair.

I have the feeling also that trading "triangular pairs" will give better results in that area:

using GU, EU and EG triangle together will make trending pairs counter losses on the side-ways ones of the triangle.

Now you need to play with the settings to find a good TP level for each triangle that will give higher wins to counter the losses on other pairs.

Setting a higher TP as Mer suggested with his new settings is the way to go i think.

I haven't analysed that into details yet, so it's just a "feeling" for now.

Hey there Sq...  I'm still having difficulties getting a readout (display) for any Monday activity over here with the Indi V9.  The indicator works flawlessy TUESDAY thru FRIDAY, but I get no indication for MONDAY.  I'm located in the Eastern US, so I have set my Start Time to 22:00 and my End Time to 01:00, which is probably the cause of the situation.

Please take a look at the attached screen shot where you can see nothing displayed for Monday, and the settings I have in place for the indicator.

Sq,

You did already touch on this point a couple of days ago, just wondered if you had any more thoughts on it.

There seems to be a bit of a reversal going on at the moment on a few pairs, but I am speaking in particular about the EUR USD. We have a situation where a buy order has reached its TP and closed out. Price then starts to drop away and as soon as it hits the original buy in price, the ea re-enters another buy order.

This is despite what must be considered a good chance of a full price reversal.

Do you beleive it would be a good idea to only enter pending buy & sell orders when price retraces back to within the blue box area rather than at the moment price drops through the original buy point. This would give us a bit of a buffer. In doing this, the buy order will only be triggered should price rally back up through the buffer back to the buy point from within the blue box area, indicating a trade hopefully more likely to be in the right direction.

This will avoid buying in the face of a reversal and watching it go straight on through to SL.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Duh... thanks for the quick reply.  I should have caught that one myself!  Sorry for bothering you, but thanks again.

Hello,

there is one detail I would like to understand:

The EA is working with the output of the London Breakout Indicator 9.1 "LB-".

But when you are backtesting you do not have the possibility to define any indicators. Is the backtesting getting really the same results?

My backtesting results currently do not look very good (tested only with cable).

Here is my thought:

1. Trader A forward-test a strategy starting from 2010.04.01 till 2010.04.30.

2. At 2010.05.01, Trader B back-test the same strategy using historical data from 2010.04.01 - 2010.04.30.

Assuming the history data are valid for the strategy, I think both Trader A and Trader B will get the same result

--- 帖子 #689 ---
What is flawed is what's made by human .. in our case the EA and indis (assuming the backtesting engine is not too bad) ... Backtesting helps in identifying coding flaws created by human mistakes and eventually, improving on strategies.

Not understanding backtesting means 2 things:

- whether you're logic and coding is undeniable although you have no clue what's happening in the market (considering you would have to develop a strategy out-of nothing not to be biased by historical datasets - or it would be similar to backtesting .... Ooooops)

- or you're a fat finger trader that sits his ass on a chair and wait for some coder to actually develop a working EA ... or wait for some academic individual to develop a new working strategy .. in which case the useful brain is that of the coder/academic ... and you're only a finger, but a finger that does not give back what should be to the ppl supporting you.

Not the words of someone else, actually my own (and I'm not a professional coder).

my broker time is gmt+ 2, what time do i change the EA to?

please help!

Take one of Mer's charts above, compare to your chart, you'll find the Start/End of the box easily, then just set the start/end time to bar time of the the first/last bars matching Mer's box.

It's that simple, and you'll be sure to have the correct settings, whatever local/broker time you have.

Here are the totals for the week for each pair. Now keep in mind the issues in Greece and the stock market drop at the end of last week played havoc on the market for this weeks trading activity.

Eur/Usd- +158 pips

Gbp/Usd- +93 pips
Usd/Chf- +145 pips
Gbp/Chf- +867 pips
Usd/Jpy- -47 pips
Eur/Jpy- No trades

Gbp/Jpy- No trades

Total for the week- +1216 pips

It's very obvious the big winner this week was the Gbp/Chf, probably due to the larger range and being a Gbp pair. Usd/Jpy was the loser this week as the only pair in negative numbers. Again, this is probably due to the fact it has probably the smallest range of the seven pairs tested and doesn't provide as much movement outside of the Asian session.

Due to last weeks bad news, ranges for Eur/Jpy and Gbp/Jpy were extremely high and we had red boxes all week. If this trend continues, I will have to evaluate and raise the "MaxBoxSize" to coincide better with the daily ranges. For example, if we would've changed Eur/Jpy to an 80 pips box size and Gbp/Jpy to a 100 pip box size, we would have made an additional +381 pips. (See pics)

I'll leave the box sizes alone for now and see how next weeks results turn out.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Congratulations Mer & thanks again for introducing this method, i've make +140 pips for 1st 2 weeks in May & about the same last 2 weeks in April. I just a conservative trade on GBPUSD only with my settings posted earlier. Just a decipline & PO for the day that allowes to trade. Win more than loss.

Hello.

I use script version 3. Works beautiful.

I would like to ask you.

Is there any possibility to make in script function like Open Only Short or Only long?

Sometimes is good when I see support or resistance levels to open only one direction pending orders.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Hi all! I just wanted to share with you the results I got from yesterday (friday) using Squalou EA.

It started awfully bad the day with all pairs giving a buy signal just to reverse and head straight down to buy stop losses. In about 1 hour all the gains from last week were wiped out (25% of total account balance). I left for work and when I arrived in the night not only it recovered all the losses but had even made a very good profit! No Martingale used.

My settings are 50 pips max box size, box times 03-06, entry point 0.8 take profit 2.60. For GPB/JPY I use 60 pips maxboxsize. Micro lots with 0.02 - OCO false - unlimited trades - 2 losses maximum fo the day.

Take a look at the statement from yesterday - the recovery was amazing! Check page 2 of the attached pdf for the equity curve.

I just have a suggestion and I would like to hear your thoughts. After the buy signals the PA moved quickly to stop loss and since I am using the close half-position when in profit it's very difficult to recover all the losses because stop loss goes activated with 0.02 lots but take profit closes 0.01 lot at half way and the other 0.01 lot on take profit level. So your will recoup 1.5 of total loss for each winning trade.

What do you think of putting the option to close also half position (0.01 lot) in the middle of the way to the stop-loss and close the other 0.01 if it hits full stop-loss target? Woudn't this be more secure in days like yesterday that PA touched buy levels and headed down for the rest of the day?

--- 帖子 #705 ---
can you explain these numbers ? 0.8, 2.6

--- 帖子 #706 ---
When you load the script in the common tab there is a box for long & short which is the default and long only short only. That would be the easy way to do what you want

--- 帖子 #707 ---
wow that was a good week for you.. i am just curious about your account. is it a live account? or a demo ?.. and how about your broker investtechfx, is it good?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Hello Mer,

great overview - are you trading this already live or on a demo account?

Bambo0

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Thanks I will try it.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Sure.

In the indicator LondonBreakoutV9.1 made by Squalou I use the new values given by Mer:

EntryFactor: 0.8

TPFactor: 2.6

Those are the values the EA will use to define buy/sell signal and SL/TP.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Not sure what you are trying to say here.

Obviously unless you are also logging the spread over the test period and somehow feeding it into your back tester, any back test & forward test results will be different. If you are interested to see how much spread can alter over a trading day check here - http://www.mt4i.com/spread - this is not even considering differences caused by re-quotes, disconnects etc.

My point was that back testing is only useful for checking coding logic as you rightly say - and nothing else. So many newbies assume because a back test has 90% quality & a nice upwards graph an EA will be profitable when live.

To make things even tougher for 'real' automated trading, all data coming in from brokers is different - see attached (two feeds superimposed). You will even find that data from the same broker, but from a different server varies. There are many examples in other threads of live & demo results differing between brokers - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=5096

IMHO there is only one way to test an EA and that is on a small live account on the broker you eventually want to use. Yes, it will cost you a small amount of money but at least you will be getting back some useful data.

Hope this post gives food for thought -

--- 帖子 #712 ---
It's a live account.

Opened with 150 USD on the 2010/05/03 to try Mer  strategy and also to try Squalou EA and Indicator (thanks to both of you  for your great work! ).

With 7 days trading (the first two days  were spent testing several variables in the indicator ) and the other 5  with the final settings balance has risen from the  original 150 USD to 223 USD yesterday.

The broker I choose for  this live test account was investtechfx. They say in their home page 1 pip spread on majors but I don't see that, I see 2 pips spread...  perhaps because I have a micro account. They also charge 10 cents commission for each 0.01 lot so in fact, this makes each trade a 3 pip spread. 2 pips is the regular spread, to pay for the commission you need to make an extra pip in profit.

Also one thing I dislike on them is that limit orders, take profits and stop loss orders are only accepted if they are at least 20 pips away from current PA.

Sometimes some of the EA's orders arent accepted because they aren't 20 pips away from current PA.

Because of this yesterday EA buy order in USD/CAD was rejected because the box formed had 13 pips only. If the order was accepted it would hit take profit for 24 pips...

The good thing about them is that it's very easy to open the account, all paperwork is made online, in about two hours time you can start trading live if you make your initial deposit by PayPal like I did.

Don't know if it's easy to get money from them because I still didn't ask for a wire to my account, this is another story and usually it's here that issues arise...  Also, in a few days happened when the EA fire all the orders in the beginning of the trade period, some orders are refused because "trade context is busy" error, don't know if it's generated because a lot of orders are sent at the same time by the EA... On manual closing I got twice re-quote also, but never in my favor...

So in the end, I think this strategy is really good, because with all this handicaps created by this broker it still managed to make my balance grow around 70 USD with 7 days trading. Now imagine how much more one can make with a commission free/no stupid PA rules broker...

--- 帖子 #713 ---
yes that's because too many trades are sent simultaneously.

I have fixed it in my beta-test version that will come out soon.

All orders will be sent using a "reliable" version of the trade functions...

Coming soon...

Hi SQ anyone...

I have it all setup, and turned it on this afternoon (MST USA) (probably your evening) and it already drawing the boxes for the breakouts and trying to put the limit orders in.

This is most likely my error on not using it properly, but just getting it set up for EA, thanks!

Mer et al,

What do you think of setting the pip box range to a maximum based on current ATR from daily levels?

50 seems like an odd number to pick out of the sky and different pairs move differently.  A 40 pip box might be too big for some! While a 75 pip might be just the right size for some.... ?

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Hi

please use latest EA, it is V3.0 now (in post #653 ).

Also make sure the objPrefix is set to "LB-".

Sq.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I just picked a number that seemed to represent a pip total for all the ranges I'm testing. Yes, some should be lower like Usd/Chf and some could be higher like Gbp/Jpy and Gbp/Chf. If you want to change you box size using ATR, feel free to do so.

The only problem with using ATR is how many periods do you average? 5? 14? 21? What happens when you have a global crisis happening like a few weeks ago which caused a 1100+ pip drop in the Dow which, coincidentally, cause a 1100+ pip drop in the Gbp/Jpy. Are you going to then put a 400+ pip box on the Gbp/Jpy because the ATR says that's what it should be? It's a hard, tough decision and I feel, and take this only as an opinion, that it would create more work in having to change the value everyday than to just have a fixed point. In reality, the only thing the box size represents is the maximum box size you'll tolerate for your specific trading style.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I think you have a maximum put into the indicator which you can plug in.

Then also have an entry into the indicator for the ATR specs and for the EA as well.  Kind of like what Steve is doing w/ Epsilon.

Then, put it on auto-pilot and see what happens on forward testing.

Just a recommendation to make this a little more automatic and customized over time.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
SQ...

Here you go, I believe this is a bug.

It opened my 2nd entry and then exited at the wrong buy stop...

Make sense?

the pix is too small to read the values on the chart and the report.

Can you post what the "expert" window reports ?

Hallo Mr. Squalou

Can you please modify your indicator V7 in two points:

1) painting and computing box exactly in adjusted time (e.g . 3 - 6 means not 6.15 but 6). As you can see in pictures,difference in 15min bar yesterday was 20 pip (can be more).

2) setting time in localTime (no GMT)

Name it e.g. Frankfurt Break.

And thank you.

Okay here are the    charts for Monday. Red boxes are    losing trades, Blue   boxes are winning trades, and Black   boxes are open trades that have not    been completed and will be added  to  the next day's updates. No open trades have been carried over from Friday.

I am also raising the MaxBoxSize to 90 pips on 4 pairs- Gbp/Usd, Gbp/Jpy, Eur/Jpy, and Gbp/Chf. This is to take advantage of the higher daily ranges and to allow more trade opportunities.

Lopuch, 1) when computing the box size from 3-6 you must include the whole 6:00 candle. If you don't want to include the whole 6:00 candle, just set the time from 3-5:45.

2) the majority of indicators and EA's are based on GMT time and it was pretty evident earlier on that most people reading this thread despised using local time. I can't speak for him, but I wouldn't expect sqaulou to change it for one person, sorry.

Hello. Could you please post your indicator settings.

I believe you have EntryFactor - 0.8 and TPfactor 2.618  ??

--- 帖子 #737 ---
These new settings seem a little rough for gbpusd, have you backchecked them at all merl?

Great end result from 2/1 til present of +9060 pips, however...

13x multiplier is used 9 times

34x multiplier is used 3 times
89x multiplier is used 2 times!

When those huge multipliers get opened, the losses before you finally get the win wipe out the gains for a month or more's time until u get them all back with the single win.

On EU this new setup looks real good for the same period, but for GU it's very rocky as you can see.

Of course, since these multipliers don't bother you I'm sure you don't care too much, but figured i'd still make you aware of it if you do care

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Like I said, that is the risk you must be willing to accept when using martingale methods. Again the secret is to have you account properly funded to handle such situations. Every pair is going to provide different results, as in the Eur/Usd you mentioned. It is always a good idea to use multiple pairs which can combat the drawdowns and help build up the account. Also using non-correlated pairs that do not mimic each other may help as well.

I think sqaulou is working on this in his next version, not sure though.

I am not using the ea for backtesting and collecting stats.  Both the indicator and the ea are buggy for me, so am waiting until kinks get ironed out.  Can't even drop that ea on a chart, as it wants to immediately set the two pending trades as soon as I do.

what is ur maximum box size for each pair?

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi All..

I trade basically the same system just different setting and when I have a large box, 60 or more, i adjust the times to get a manageable box size to trade.  This way I can at least still get some trades in.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Different pair should have different box size since they have different volatility right? Can u be more specific?

--- 帖子 #750 ---
From last post on the new settings, box max's were supposed to be 60 pips for everything except GJ which was 80 pips.

That must have changed I guess?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Been testing that out too.

Shift time to 0300 - 0545 GMT, or even down to 0530 for the box. Reduces some of the boxes that would have been too large to be traded. But also reduces the TP. Makes TP's easier to be hit and more of them over the pairs.

Over 6 pairs yesterday, was 220 vs 118 pips. Didnt get them all though, banked 115.

The trick seems to be deciding to use the reduced time before its too late & price goes pass the entry lines. But even then it often comes back for another start within a few bars (15M).

cheers scalpz

Hello,

I guess that you trade with 0,01 lot like me

You have to disable Half Close Function and set it on false. When you have opnened 0,01 lot it is the smallest one and obviously half of it can not be closed.

I guess this function works starting from 0,02 lot...

Hi all,

i know you've been waiting long since my last V3.0 EA...

Here comes V4.0 version of the EA...

New features:

- Added TRAILING STOP capability

New inputs:

TrailingStopPips(0): pips to trail the StopLoss; when 0 no trailing is applied (fixed SL as before).

TrailingStopStep(1): trailing SL will jump by this amount instead of trailing at every tick;

(helps limit the number of sent orders, and therefore order rejections).

- Added profit lock-in after fixed profit:

New input "BreakEvenPips":

when "BreakEvenPips" is >0, SL is moved to BE+"BreakEvenProfitInPips" when price has reached BE+"BreakEvenPips";

Works independently from "AllowHalfClose" option (but uses the same BreakEvenProfitInPips value);

Will also be trailed if TrailingStop is selected;

(inspired from Steve's MPTM EA...)

- Added MaxRisk input: if >0, then order size is the min of Lot input and calculated max Lot based on MaxRisk and Stop-Loss;

- All open/pending trades will be closed when the EA is unloaded;

[edit]

- replaced order-related functions with "reliable" versions of them... (will retry 10 times at timed intervals if call fails).

[/edit]

- when MagicNumber is 0, a unique MagicNumber is created by the EA, MagicNumbers will be different for each pair/TF;

This helps running the EA on different pairs/TF without having to

- added Alerts when Indicator SETTINGS GlobalVariables cannot be found; EA will stop trading in this case.

- fix: in V3.0, objPrefix default value was not set to "LB-" as it should have been, leading to error 130 "invalid stops";

Let's see how this one goes.

Sorry, no martingale code yet,  i'm working on it now...

I have had the indicator running alone on the charts all week, all displaying perfectly etc.

I just dropped the new v4 ea onto my charts, and it immediately set the pending orders for yesterday's box, even though I am well past the session end time.  How do I prevent this from happening, and I am hoping the pending orders will cancel and new pendings will be created when today's box forms? (in 1 hour).  Hopefully these pendings won't get opened before then

I have changed the box size size for Gbp/Usd, Gbp/Chf, Eur/Jpy, and   Gbp/Jpy this week due to their higher daily ranges and stronger   movements

Today was a rough day with the stock market drop affecting almost all the pairs as we gave back all the profit we made on Tuesday.

Eur/Usd

Trade 1= -83 pips
Trade 2= +168 (+84 x 2)

No open trades at this time.

Gbp/Usd

Trade 1= -99 pips from Wednesday

No open trades at this     time. Next valid entry will use a multiplier of 2.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Usd/Chf

Trade 1= -172 pips (-86 x 2) from Wednesday
Trade 2= -510 pips (-102 x 5)

No open trades   at this   time.

Gbp/Chf

Trade 1= -161 pips

No open trades at this      time. Next valid entry will use a multiplier of 2.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Usd/Jpy

Trade 1= +62

No open trades   at  this   time.

Eur/Jpy

Trade 1= -312 pips (-156 x 2) from Wednesday

No open trades at this      time. Next valid entry will use a multiplier of 5.

Gbp/Jpy

Trade 1= -770 (-154 x 5) from Wednesday

No open trades at this      time. Next valid entry will use a multiplier of 13.

Everybody can basically take a break tonight as Usd/Jpy is the only pair I have with a valid box for tonight. Probably best as the market will hopefully stabilize a little before resuming on Monday.

I will also be looking over charts and playing around with some times and settings for an Asian session version of this strategy over the next week to see if there is any merit in doing so. sqaulou needs to take care of some adjustments to the indicator for this to work properly as certain features of the indicator are not drawing properly according to the different times before 00:00 GMT I'm testing. I'm sure, as usual, he will take care of this promptly as he always does (I wonder if he sleeps?).

--- 帖子 #778 ---
yes, i do sleep a bit...

having hard time with those time-settings though... seems like everyone is having different behaviours !

Mer, please post or email me the buggy charts with the before-00:00 hours.

I thought i had it fixed... at least it works on my charts!

But i have broker time=local time for me, so that could explain why i cannot reproduce these !?@!*!! issues!!!

I'd like as much as all of you to have those issues definitely fixed so we can all carry on doing what we are here for: testing and improving the STRATEGY rather than the Indi+script+EA !!!

We need reliable tools to get trustable results...

I get these error massage from MT4. What's wrong with my set?

2010.05.21 14:44:15London Breakout EA-V4.0 GBPUSD,M15: Alert: LB EA: GBPUSD OrderSend() FAILED at 1.43190000 (4051): invalid function parameter value

--- 帖子 #780 ---
hmmm.... trying to open 0.00 lots... !

It has to do with the "Risk" input (2%), and your current Account Free Margin.

I have put a check for the fixed Lot input, but not for the calculated Lot based on Risk and SL at trade open.

Can you try this change in the EA v4 code:

add the following code (in bold) at the beginning of the DisplayUserFeedback() function:

Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void DisplayUserFeedback()
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
{

[b]   if (MaxRisk <= 0) {
comment = StringConcatenate(comment, Gap, "Lot size = ", Lot, " (MaxRisk not used)", NL);
} else {
double lotsToTrade = MathMin(Lot,GetMaxLot(StopLoss,MaxRisk));
comment = StringConcatenate(comment, Gap, "MaxRisk = ", MaxRisk, "% => ", DoubleToStr(lotsToTrade,2), "Lots, AccountFreeMargin = ", DoubleToStr(AccountFreeMargin(),0), AccountCurrency(), NL);
}
[/b]
comment = StringConcatenate(Gap, WindowExpertName(), " ", EA_VERSION, NL);
.......
Then see what it says in the AccountFreeMargin and lots.

Temporarily, you can set the Risk to 0 to remove the dynamic Lot calculation.

I will add a check on trade opening, and also a printout in the Status zone.

i set your EA..but no gmt offset....so the box is miss

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Sq,

Attached is the 4.0 EA with Martingale.

I've named it "London Breakout EA-V4.0_Pat With Mart".

Mer & Sq can decide to make it official with a Version change or extension.

All the Changes and Additions in the code are within //Pat --- //Pat.

Using FindNext with //Pat text will take you to all modifications.

The changes are based on the assumption that only a single Op_Buy or OP_Sell order exists. This is taken care of in Order Send code in (IsTradeAllowed()) in the Start routine. All Martingale losses are tolerable(Mer) - Unlimited Account Balance The algo is to keep track of ticket number of Op_Buy order using p_LongOpenTicketNo and LongOpenTicketNo

or of Op_Sell order using

p_ShortOpenTicketNo and ShortOpenTicketNo

where p_ keeps track of open order at previous tick.

If p_LongOpenTicketNo > LongOpenTicketNo then the open OP_Buy order just closed ( similar for OP_Sell) last tick or this tick depending on when the "Aggregate" function is called.

Function GetProfitLossThisOrder is called to determine if the last order closed was profitable.

If Profitable, the Mart_Idx=0 (that is lots=Lot) else Mart_Idx++ and lots=Lot*MartFactor[Mart_Idx] prior to calling the OpenPendingOrder Function.

Array MartFactor holds the multipliers to be used in succesion.

MaxLevel is user definable, that is how many levels can the martingale advance to. Maximum is the number of factors in the MartFactor array and is checked in Init();

ReStartMartSeq is user definable , that is if MaxLevel is exceeded, should the EA revert index 0 of MartFactor or keep the last multiplier till a profitable order is achieved.

lotsToTrade determination is done prior to SendPendingOrder in if(IsTradeAllowed()) in the Start routine.

OCO and UseMartingale should be true. This check is performed in Init().

This just one way of implementing Martingale in this Ea. There maybe other more effecient ways to achieve the same result.

I've not had a chance to demo it since its Friday and, if I'm not mistaken, this EA will not backtest. If it does, we should have an answer by Sunday Open.

Hope this helps.

Pat

I changed the code and complied but MT4 still show error.

Pat and Squalou

Beat me if I am too stupid to run this piece of art on my server, but, unfortunately, I am getting very much the same error message as with the previous V4:

LB EA: USDCHF Some Indicator SETTINGS are missing;

Please verify objPrefix in the Indicator and the EA;

(objPrefix is currently set to LB- in the EA)

What am I missing here?

Thanks and keep up the great work!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Wow! Great work Pat1!

Changes are pretty straight forward.

I'm sure Mer will love it!

ok... i just quickly spotted a first bug in GetProfitLossThisOrder() i think:

the selection function is wrong, it uses SELECT_BY_TICKET with an index in the trades history; it should be SEKECT_BY_POS.

But it's even simpler than that: we just want to select the order with ticketno...

Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void GetProfitLossThisOrder(int ticketno)
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
{
bool LastOrderProfitable=false;
OrderSelect(ticketno,SELECT_BY_TICKET);
if (TimeDayOfWeek(OrderCloseTime()) == TimeDayOfWeek(Time[0]) ) {
if(OrderProfit()>0) LastOrderProfitable=true;
}

GetMart_Idx(LastOrderProfitable);

}//void GetProfitLossThisOrder(int ticketno)
Then, another bug might be in GetAggregatePosition():

Inserted Code   if(p_LongOpenTicketNo >LongOpenTicketNo )
GetProfitLossThisOrder( p_LongOpenTicketNo);
} //  Long Open Order Just Closed Last tick (or this tick???)
p_LongOpenTicketNo is not initialized, should be set to 0 at init at least;

I'm not sure about the logic here yet: ticket numbers are assigned in increasing values, so the "previous" ticket should always be < current one, not >.

Same for Short ones.

I'll check more into details soon.

Got to go...

Great work Pat1 anyway.

We'll get this EA where Mer wants it to go!

BTW, you CAN backtest this EA...

It just needs to have the Indi setup on a chart with the pair to be tested, so the INPUTS variables are defined, then the EA will use those values, even in backtest mode.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
squalou,

did you see my issue posted about the ea opening the pending orders for the previous day even if past the trading session end time?

Can u look into that, or does it not happen to you?

--- 帖子 #787 ---
it happened to me all the time.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
good, not just me then.

what i just did last night was to turn ea off until my box was done forming, and manually deleted all the pendings it put in.

Not a huge deal, but would be nice to not have to do that

--- 帖子 #789 ---
I received the same error

--- 帖子 #790 ---
i think i can reproduce it, finally!...

By changing the Indi time settings while the EA is loaded, to make it draw the box just a few minutes later.

I see it is sending orders while outside of trading hours, and also using "yesterday's" values...

Now i will get this one down too!!!

You'll have a nice working EA for next week, guys!

And with Pat's Martingale code debugged as well, hopefully, we'll have some very interesting week coming.

Sq

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Awesome, glad u were able to recreate it so you can fix.  Looking forward to playing with it next week!  have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #792 ---
for the meantime, just use the manual version. im still using v8 together with the scriptv3.1

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Sq,

We are interested in closing of an Op_Buy or Op_Sell trade.

If an Op_BuyStop changes to an Op_Buy last tick or this tick, LOTN(Long Open....) gets the value of its ticket number otherwise is equal to 0. p_LOTN was initialized as 0 when declared. Since it is less then LOTN, the two if statements will be false and the p_values will be initiated to LOTN value. If the Op_Buy closes, LOTN will be 0. P_LOTN will be revised to 0 after the getprofitlosslastorder function is run. In other words, the update of p_ values has to occur before a check for profitloss.

Similarly for SOTN and p_SOTN

Also,

In the event there is a half trade, the new ticket value of the remaing half order will be greater than the Initial ticket value and since the p- values have not been revised, the if statements will be false. The p_ values will be initialized to the new OTM values. If this remaining half order is a loss, Mart_Idx will increase. The logic is right. Let's see if MT4 obliges.

You are absolutely right about the By_Ticket coding in OrderSelect.

Thanks

Pat

Pat, you are speaking another language, but I hope you can read this!

THANK YOU!  And SQ!  You guys rock!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I hope everyone had a good weekend and hopefully we will rebound from the train wreck regarding last weeks trading. I did want to update my Usd/Jpy trade from Friday as it was the only pair to have a valid box. I would have done it on Friday but had to rush to catch a flight to Chicago for the weekend for my birthday.

Usd/Jpy

Trade 1= -75 pips

The next valid trade will start with a multiplier of 2>

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Unless you were a 'trend is your friend' kind of guy, I think everyone got killed...

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I am hoping I can fix this issue?

When/IF I disconnect my MT4 while trades are in progress (must reboot), then I typically turn off EA's, then shut down MT4, then restart etc..

When I do that w/ this EA, it closes all my orders?

How do I reboot while trades are open?

--- 帖子 #798 ---
I already read the first post.

I put an indicator and then put an EA. After that I get lot of error massages from MT4.

another case I put an indicator with other script and then put the EA. This case I do not get any error massage from MT4.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
btw i tried USDCHF : 04:00-05:00 GMT box size 35 ..

EURJPY: 05:00-06:00 GMT box size 80...worked good today..

question to squalou on some pairs.. i have " the robot has been suspended. Reason: you need to change the Magicnumber input" even after change it's still written.. is normal?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
guess 1.

It is not enough to change the magic number while the ea is running. Remove the ea and change the magic number as you reload it or even earlier by editing the .mq4 file.

guess 2.

Need different magic number for each pair. But with 400 odd posts, guess you know that & I dont think it is enforced by the code.

guess 3.

You are trying to run it live so edit .mq4 file, then load it. Or save a set file, remove ea, reload ea & use the set file with the settings you want. Really is a bit like guess 1.

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #801 ---
yesterdays trade seems promising. just waiting for gbpusd and gbpjpy to take its profit. hopefully it wont reverse.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
You know, if you're trading manually, a smart thing to do is just to close out the trade if you're within a few pips of your target, like on your Gbp/Usd. I don't believe in giving back all your profits just because you just missed your target by a whisker, just a thought. If your trading with an EA, well you're kinda stuck by the logic of the EA unless you watch the trade and close manually.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
its ok mer. basically i am running two mt4 with same setup. one where i move half close profit and the other is just a drag and forget system. i am experimenting which would be better in the long run. it seems quite obvious what would be the winner but i just dont mind .

still i thank you for these good strategy.

Hi all,

Here comes V5.0 version of the EA...

New features: MARTINGALE

!!! CAUTION : this is still EXPERIMENTAL CODE !!!

DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN LIVE ACCOUNTS YET,

it still needs to be debugged and stabilized.

Thanks to Pat1, who coded the Martingale part.

You can setup the Martingale multipliers sequence in the "martingale_sequence" input.

The default sequence is set to "0,1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181".

When the first element in the list is 0, the martingale is DISABLED.

This is the default.

When a trade is a loss, the next multiplier is used for the next trade.

When it is a win, we come back to the first multiplier for the next trade.

When the last multiplier is reached (9 consecutive losses with the default sequence), the multiplier will either remain to the last value (4181 in the default sequence), or come back to the first, depending on "RestartMartSeq" input:

"RestartMartSeq" set to false (default) will keep last multiplier until a win.

Set to true will come back to first multiplier.

- added "ClosePendingWhenUnload" input (default=false): when true, all pending trades will be closed when unloading the EA, or when MT4 platform is closed. OPEN trades are left unchanged.

v4.0 was closing open trades as well...

- fixed (hopefully...) the EA trading outside of trading hours.

@ Pat1: the Martingale code logic still looks suspicious to me...

I haven't gone thru backtesting yet so i don't know what is going to come out of this...

Please backtest and/or forward-test it.

For those of you who had the trading-instead-of-sleeping and/or still-using-yesterdays-levels issues, hit my fingers if it's still still still buggy...

I have added the display of the "current Bar Time" in the status, so we can now compare the "local time", "broker time", and "current bar time", and see why we get these behaviours.

Sq.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Thanks Squalou!

I will put it on test asap and let u know if any more bugs arise.

question:

can you explain why OCO needs to be set to true in order to use the martingale progression?  Will this prevent the other side of the box trade being taken upon a stopout?

Also,

Do you think in the next version you can add a 'no new trade' time?  This time would just allow no new trades to be taken, however would still manage the existing trades until the end session time, which would then close the trades.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #809 ---
ye i dont know what s the bug.. i just reloaded...

thnks

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Squalou,

I still get the same error message as with the previous versions:

LB EA: USDCHF Some Indicator SETTINGS are missing;

Please verify objPrefix in the Indicator and the EA;

(objPrefix is currently set to LB- in the EA)

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Hi Icecube

The EA requires the Indicator to have been loaded into the chart once, so that the settings are exported as system GlobalVariables (that you can watch and eventually change with the F3 key).

The EA will import these settings by reading the GlobalVariables set by the Indi.

The error message you are getting reports that it cannot find the required GlobalVariables.

Either you have not loaded the indicator first, or you have changed the "objPrefix" from the Indi, (which is "LB-" by default), and the EA has it set to "LB-" (as it says in the message).

Hit F3 to see if you have a series of "LB-(pairname)-(otherthings)" variables set. (for instance, "LB-EURUSD-EndTime", "LB-EURUSD-EntryFactor", etc)

Sq

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hello Scoulou,

looks great, after catched the criminal pillock, the Demo System is prepared for the first trades.

Could you please explain some more regarding the OCO, why is it madatory for the martingale and for which trades is it used?

--- 帖子 #813 ---
so the EA dosn't work for back-testing no?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
It does, but there are definitely still some bugs to be worked out.

Backtest in visual mode, and drop the indicator with proper settings on the chart while paused, then let er rip.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
i see the entry/sl factor play a big rule some time to keeps you from bad trade, (like entry factor of 0.5 for last couple of weeks keeps me out of couple of bad trades) i'm wondering if we can make the EA work with back testing we may find by Optimization some more accurate entry/sl factors per pair ( i mean factor for EU probably different than UJ .. etc) for better result

Sq,

Been wondering why we need an external indi "v9". One of my ea's i have a code as follows:

This bit of code is run as soon as the speciifed start time is reached , for example

If the server time hour is 7 and local time minute is 0 and localtime seconds is less than 15, find the highest and the lowest values based on lookback. As long as the chart period is H1, or less, the code will return the boxsize. Cond_Get_Levelsflag is set to false once the levels are acquired.

the code below is designed for a factor of 0.3. All stop losses are hidden and take profits are hidden exept for emergency StopLoss_Buy and StopLoss_Sell.

int lookback=60*Hours_GoBack/Period();

hh=High[iHighest(NULL,0,MODE_HIGH,lookback,1)];

ll= Low[iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW, lookback,1)];

Print("HH ",hh," LL ",ll);

Cond_GetHiLo=false;

boxsize=(hh-ll)/Point;

Print("HH ",hh," LL ",ll , "boxsize ",boxsize);

if(boxsize<=BoxSize)

{ bs=boxsize*Point;

TradeBox=true;

Entry_Buy =NormalizeDouble(hh+0.3*bs, Digits);

Entry_Sell =NormalizeDouble(ll-0.3*bs, Digits);

StopLoss_Buy =NormalizeDouble(ll , Digits);

StopLoss_Sell =NormalizeDouble(hh , Digits);

TakeProf_Buy =NormalizeDouble(hh+1.3*bs, Digits);

TakeProf_Sell =NormalizeDouble(ll-1.3*bs, Digits);

HalfTakeProfit_Buy =NormalizeDouble(hh+0.8*bs,Digits);

HalfTakeProfit_Sell =NormalizeDouble(ll-0.8*bs,Digits);

Cond_Get_Levels=false;

Another idea that may be worth pusuing is as follow. Open a 3 unit BuyStop and SellStop OCO is true Partial Close one unit at half way point.(Current Ea) Two units at BE. Partial Close one unit at TakeProf.(Current Ea) Trail last unit with boxsize or use 10 pip stepped 50 sma as Stoploss or 3ATR. Apply Martingale factors to individual stages of the trade or the whole trade. Pat

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Sq,

Attached is a snapshot of tradeable box with no trades taken.  Also attached is the set file. M15 EU open prices only.

Martingale seems to kick in.

For some reason, I could not upload the set file. Not in the list of extensions of "attachable" files. So its in txt format. Could you please implement it if and when you have time. Thanks.

Pat

--- 帖子 #821 ---
This is exactly why the Indicator is needed: the EA does NOT use any hard-coded factors, as opposed to your suggested code above.

It will set the correct factors into the GlobalVariables, so the EA can import them and use the correct factors.

The EA then already knows how to determine the hours and box size and levels based on the imported factors.

That's all.

That way you don't need to have those inputs added into the EA.

Sq

--- 帖子 #822 ---
actually, as long as you have dropped an indi on a chart with the same pair and objPrefix as the EA settings you are going to backtest, you don't even need to pause the backtest and load the indi again.

Do it once and forget it.

The globalVars are set once, and will not disappear until you remove them manually or change the settings in the indi.

- load the indi once;

- run the EA in normal mode or backtest mode, both will work as many times as you want.

Sq

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Pat1, do you have any reason for having enforced OCO when using Martingale ?

If price goes back into the middle area, having OCO ON or OFF won't matter: the buystop/sellstop orders will be placed anyway.

Why do we need OCO ?

Sq

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi all,

I have a USDCHF that was profitable first thing this morning.  However, on the Buy Stop for the next trade (if it goes long) it placed a .02 (L2) instead of .01 (L1).

So, I am guessing the martingale code isn't working quite yet.

--EDIT:  ALSO, IT LOST A TRADE, THEN DIDN'T MARTIN UP.  Basically, it doesn't seem to be working at all.  The .02 trade from earlier was now cancelled for some reason?

I run backtesting over just last week...

and the mart factor rocketted up to 4181...

and the tester kept yelling "pending order deleted (not enough money)"

Sure it's buggy !!!!

As i said: this is EXPERIMENTAL CODE...

Ok, we'll come back later with a patched version (note that i didn't say "fixed" version,  )

I've got some work in the oven, looks like....

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Pat,

the set file has the martingale sequence set to

martingale_sequence=1,1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181

you have doubled the first "1", so the sequence will not be 1,2,... but 1,1,2,...

That's not what we want.

To enable the mart code, just REMOVE the leading "0,".

Sq.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Yes, I understand.

Ok, I have a failed usdjpy that didn't martin up.

then, I had a GBPCHF that did!  Woohoo... working 50% of the time!

i am manually doing 7 pairs every day since last 1 month. i am at BE. lots of work and no gain. does it work well for only few pairs ? i have EU, GU, EJ, UC, UCAD,UJ, EG in my list.

how are others experiences ? the main draw back of the system is its less than 1:1 RRR, i take 1 trade in each direction per pair

Ok guys... after a bit of debugging the mart code, here is what i get...

I tested just GU from 20-26 may, with my own box settings ,

starting with 0.02 lots only, $10.000 account;

with and without martingale (default mart factors),

allowing 15 consecutive losses before giving up for the day

I let you enjoy the tester result curves...

Without Martingale:

Mer,

If I can give an advice, don't put too much on Martingale to make the system profitable. If the system itself doesn't have what so called "edge", simply Martingaling them won't make any good.

If we rely only on Martingaling to make profit, we don't need any specific strategy. In my humble opinion, randomly buy or sell on any random time, use fixed tp/sl, multiply the lots to recover losses, back to initial lot when profit, will give roughly the same performance figure.

I maybe wrong...

Coding the martingale is  (for me...),

seing the account grow on backtesting is

and watching it being wiped out in just one trade of 89 lots is absolutely

But only on Demo account...

At least being able to backtest with the martingale will definitely demonstrate to EVERYONE that it is just like going to the casino, result-wise...

But i would recommend the casino for the feeling...

it's more fun than sitting in front of your automated EA, for the same result in the end...

Of course, having said that, you can still come up with a "mild" martingale sequence.

It will make you think like it cannot fail after all:

a profitable trade WILL come after a series of losses.

The only question is: how many consecutive losses can you sustain before the martingale eventually puts you back in profit...

I have been playing with various martingale sequences last night,

starting with only 0.02 lots.

I quickly changed the account initial balance from 10.000€ to 100.000€ to be able to run backtesting over more than 2 months...

Just to see it eventually grow by a few 100€ only... but with a maximal drawdawn of... 65.000€ !!!!

(max mart factor of 4181...)

Martingale IS fun... when it's not your money!

BTW, i will not release the EA with Mart code yet, it still has some issues...

It works "almost" fine... except when an order is rejected, it makes it move to the next mart factor... again and again... until the fateful "not enough money in your account" message...

I'll work on that one before releasing it...

I wouldn't want anyone wipe out his account in just 2 trades: 1 loss, then X rejected orders,

... then a second loss... and

..."GAME OVER, Insert (many many) coins (again, thanks)"

First of all thank you for your EA v5. It is really good idea to have the indi in the chart while the ea manages trade accordingly to indis setup. THANK YOU!

In last 30 days I visual backtested GU, EU and ChfU with a lot of various settings from 01/2009 till the end of March to see how many martingale levels is needed to get a profit every day. To my surprise the open time is really not the main factor of profitabilty (with martingale). Ive found that what really matters is relationship between boxsize (SL in my case)) and TP (Entry point is a SL of opositte trade in my case - no buffer). I also have found that trading any breakout box without martingale sequnce (just one trade a day win or loss) has in long term very low gain or loss in more cases.

The problem is to find proper settings for each pair to get as low martingale levels as possilble. The best setting were the box 20 pips to 10 pips (+spread) TP. In this case the tp were hit most times by the first level (no matter if there were volatile or ranging day) and there were only 9 trades of 260 in a year 2009 which exceeded third level of martingale. The problem (for me) is that the martingale sequence has to be multiplied by 3 (due twice bigger SL than TP) which needs more funds to cover at least 8 levels. The balance in your account should be then at least ten times higher than potencial gain for a year from this system. My personal thought is that Im not willing to risk thousands of dollars for 260usd a year (counting IBFX 0.1 micro account).

Another and more reasonable option were the 10-12 incl spread fo EU and 20-24 incl. spread for GU. The problem with danger to hit more than 10 levels of martingale in a day still remains here. And even if previous years showed me there were only 5 or 6 levels with some settings, it is not sure it wont exceed sixth level later.

In fact a bad trade (9 and more levels) occurs once or two times a year which is almost same probabilty like to win BINGO. Which led my to another thought: Why not reverse the martingale to loose 20 cents every day and wait for a bad trade which gain my capital in a day. In fact Bad trade is hard to find. Even with "wrong settings" you do not see too much. And its absolutely unpredictible (at least for me..) Conclusion: Antimartingale is a non-sense..

All my tests brought me back to Mers idea. I think it is safer to use martingale sequence to multiply trade after loosing trade.

I havent see more than 8 losses in a row with proper settings..

But that does not mean I will stop looking for better settings to have martingale profitable intradaily.

So thats my two cents...

Here comes V5.1 version of the EA...

--- MARTINGALE CODE PARTIALLY FIXED ---

!!! CAUTION : this is still EXPERIMENTAL CODE !!!

DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN LIVE ACCOUNTS YET,

it still needs to be debugged and stabilized.

I finally decided to release it... so you can see it for yourself and have fun tweeking it !

I reworked the Mart code completely, added an input line that allows you to put your own Mart sequence, and optimized a lot the EA for boosting backtesting performances (x10 as a minimum... and it can still be optimized more).

It gave me a chance to understand why we need OCO set to ON when using the Martingale: when an open trade hit TP or SL, the partner pending order is still open with the same Lots size, and does not reflect the new Martingale multiplier for the next trade.

(I could have changed the code wo that it cancels the pending order and replaces it with the new Mart factor instead, so you won't bother about OCO option... I will do that in the next release)

The way Martingale works is as follows:

use the "martingale_sequence" input to select the sequence of multipliers to be used;

The default sequence is set to "0,1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181  ".

When the first element in the list is 0, the martingale is DISABLED.

This is the default.

To enable it, simply remove the leading "0," (so it starts with "1,").

When a trade is a loss, the next multiplier is used for the next trade.

When it is a win, we come back to the first multiplier for the next trade.

When the last multiplier is reached (9 consecutive losses with the default sequence), the multiplier will either remain to the last value (4181 in the default sequence), or come back to the first, depending on "RestartMartSeq" input:

"RestartMartSeq" set to false (default) will keep last multiplier until a win.

Set to true will come back to first multiplier.

!!! CAUTION !!!

As i said in a previous post, this version still has an issue with the Martingale when an order is rejected: it moves to the next multiplier although no trade was taken, so it WILL end-up at the highest mart factor and it WILL wipe out your account most probably when this happens.

!!! So, please, don't use the Martingale yet, other than for backtesting purposes !!!

Again, below is a list of several mart sequences that i've been trying, if you want to try them:

Inserted Code aggressive_fibonacci="1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181"; // =every second term of fibonacci sequence;
powers_of_2="1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,";
regular_fibonacci="1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597"; // F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2);
mild_fibonacci="1,2,3,4,6,9,13,19,28,41,60,88,129,189,277,406"; // F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-3);
The "mild" sequence with Mer's new settings (boxsize 60p, entryFactor 0.8, TPFactor 2.58) gives rather good results on GU over the past 2 months, and surprisingly even better results on EU.

I did not try on other pairs yet.

I guess GBPCHF will fail miserably...

NOTE: you CAN use non-integer values for the Martingle sequence terms.

For instance: "1,1.8,2.7,5,7.9,etc"

(edit: )

I have fixed another martingale issue.

It will now correctly determine the mart factor even in case of yesterday ending with a loss.

I have remove v5.1 and replaced it by v5.2 here;

And you are a fund manager..

Sq, I have an idea. Instead of double the lot after SL being hit, why not adding position with a small lot at each certain price interval (grid) when price went against our direction, and adjust TP accordingly. It is based on the fact that the more we add position at better price (buy lower, sell higher), the less the price has to move relative to initial open price in order to reach the same profit.

I've been thinking about the martingale sequence settings...

What we observe with Mer's sequence (which i call "aggressive_fibbonacci"), is that it gives big boost when a win happens after a series of losses, BUT it is very dangerous due to its "aggressivity", and can blow your account in just 1 trade quite rapidly, because the factors are not adapted to the R:R we are using.

So.... the initial idea of a "soft" Martingale as i expect it to work is as follows:

- for simplicity sake, let's assume we have a fixed RR=TP/SL, and we are beginning with 1 lot;

- we are winning TP*lots on each win;

- we are loosing SL*lots = (1/RR)*lots on each loss;

- we want the martingale sequence to cover our previous losses, and still reach our +TP*1 profit after the martingale winning trade;

So.... this gives us the following formula:

let's call "k(i)" our martingale factors, starting with k0=1;

The Martingale requirements above lead to this:

we want that k(n) recoups our n-1 losses, and gives a +1 profit in the end;

so:

TP*k(n) = TP +  SL*( k0+k1+...+k(n-2)+k(n-1) );

<=>

k(n) = 1 +  (SL/TP) * ( k0+k1+...+k(n-2)+k(n-1) );

<=>

k(n) = 1 +  (1/RR) * ( k0+k1+...+k(n-2)+k(n-1) );

so... let's reduce this formula to determine k(n) directly:

k(n) - k(n-1) = (1/RR) * k(n-1);   (all k0...k(n-2) terms disappear)

<=>

k(n) = (RR+1)/RR * k(n-1);

and k0=1;

<=>

k(n) = ((RR+1)/RR) ^ n;

or:

k(n) = ((TP+SL)/TP) ^ n;

With an example of TP=60 and SL=20: we have RR = 60/20 = 3;

=> k(n) = (4/3) ^ n;

This gives a wonderful martingale sequence of:

"1, 1.33, 1.78, 2.37, 3.16, 4.21, 5.62, 7.49, 10, 13.32, 17.76, 23.68, 31.57"

With that sequence, you are sure to get your +TP pips overall profit at each winning trade, whatever number of losses you faced (for RR=3, remember).

And the sequence looks very "soft" compared to the other sequences i had listed earlier: after 9 losses, you are still at only *13, whereas with Mer's sequence you are at... *4181 ?

Isn't that cool ???????

Ok, this works only with a FIXED TP/SL levels.

Which is NOT the case with this strat basic rules, due to changing box size every day;

(but it is the case with the settigns i am using  )

Enjoy...

I'm no math expert, but I'll just say WOW, can you repeat that 5 times real fast!

This is very similar to what FXTradepro was using in his semi-martingale strategy here. Just increase your lots to where you just make enough to recoup your loss plus a little profit.

It would be real cool if the EA would just add up your pip totals for all your losses and then auto-calculate your new  lot sizes to get you back to positive numberst based on the new TP, a self thinker so to speak.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
ABSOLUTELY !!!

I was rereading my post when i figured out that we could just sum-up our past losses, and set the new lot size to recoup that, plus the current TP...

... Am i repeating what you just wrote ???

That is much simpler than re-calculating the martingale sequences every day to adjust it to the new box.

Well... at least it gave me a chance to see that my school math isn't to far away yet

I'll read more into the link you provided.

last few weeks, this method is not going anywhere. i am thinking of making this change to make the RR as 1:1

instead of entering at the fib price, i will wait for it to retrace to box hi/lo and then enter, this will give me 1:1, i may miss some trades that dont come back, thats ok since there is no gurantee that everything that crosses the entry level will go to target.

this gives me a better RR and will reduce the losses

one more filter could be to take the trades only in one direction depending that day trend. this also avoids whips on range bound market.

is any one using the higher fib level for entry ? this will reduce the whips to certain extent

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Here you go...

V6.0 version of the EA...

"AutoMartingale" mode !

Added "AutoMartingale" mode:

the Martingale factor will be computed dynamically so that the next winning trade will recoup all past consecutive losses, plus the current TP.

Setting "AutoMartingale" to true will enable this AutoMartingale mode, and ignore the "martingale_sequence" input.

With current Mer's settings, the RR of 1 will give you roughly a power_of_2_sequence, (1,2,4,8,16,32,64...)

if we assume that the box is fixed, which is NOT the case.

(

Remember the formula i came up with in my previous post:   k(n) = ((TP+SL)/TP) ^ n;

with TP==SL, it gives you     k(n) = 2^n...

)

Here is an example of backtesting on GU with Mer's settings (EntryFactor 0.8, TPFactor 2.58) from 2010.03.26 till today, i grep'ed the log file for the MartFactor calculation output, so you can see for yourself the factors applied after each loss:

(the actual sequence in bold is almost a "power_of_2", but adjusted to the day's box size -- you can see it moving in the "+XX pips TP"):

Oh Man!  I wasn't done testing the last one!  It isn't FARE!    haha

Will try it.  Other one seems to be working though without auto-calc, so good work!

--- 帖子 #855 ---
I don't believe this is a money maker if you don't use Martingale.

But, if you can work a system to be slightly positive or leaning your direction w/ Martingale, then you have something.  If you are trying to make a great return without MART, then I suggest this isn't it in my opinion.  I have hovered at BE w/o MART for quite some time.

It all comes down to odds, how many times can it not 'breakout' properly!

--- 帖子 #856 ---
This can not be backtested in non visual mode right squalou?  Am running it thru some tests now seems to be working pretty well in visual backtest.  I think there are still some issues, but i'll collect more data and let you know.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
yes you can backtest in non-visual -- i'm doing it about 100 times per day...

just load the indi on a chart before running the backtest, so it saves the settings that the EA will import.

You need to load the indi only once per pair, not more, then you can backtest as many times as you want, on any period/dates.

have fun...

sq

--- 帖子 #858 ---
thanks squalou, works fine.

a couple of notes so far:

it doesnt appear the martingaling is working exactly how mer does it.  Seems like you are only martingaling each side separately.  For example, if you take a loss on a short, the next short does seem to martingale correctly, however if the next trade ends up being a long, it loses the martingale increase.

So if I lose first short, lose second short, third trade happens to be a long, it's not at a factor of 5 (using mer's martingale method).

An additional feature I wouldn't mind seeing is a close all trade hour.  I think there should be a notradeafter input, as well as the sessionend input.  notradeafter will simply not take any new trades after this time, but leave open trades open.  sessionend will close all open trades at this time.

Otherwise, looks like it's running well now.  Of course, makes it extremely difficult to try to optimize for different tp/sl levels, box time hours, max box size, etc without the settings being internal to the ea and not pulled from the indicator, but ah well.

Nice job

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Yes, now that we can backtest and try mart etc, it would be nice to have the settings inputs directly in the EA.

I will add them.

A "notradeafter" input would also be useful, indeed.

Good ideas!

will do...

my reports show both buystop and sellstop orders taken with the same lots after a loss...

i don't see this behaviour.

Any log trace showing it ?

sq

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hey Squalou,

It appears it has to do with the OCO maybe not functioning exactly right?

If you look at the attached series of losses, it appears the opposite side pending orders are not being reset after a loss?

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Squalou,

You will realize that at some point, doing the math to recover every loosing strikes is actually more aggressive than Mer's original "aggressive_fibonnacci".

This is what I did/do and and mentioned earlier in the thread (see thereafter)

From my experience with  a proper math approach to recover losses and make a win every time possible, the "death sequence" will hit harder the math than it does Mer's .... that is because Mer's sequence does not take into account what is lost (that is the box size), but simply the multiplier.

Sq, What do you think will be your lot size if you loose 8 consecutive strikes with box sizes 45 and that the next one is a box size 15 ? Indeed, this will have a big impact for you ... not on Mer's

Just a hint, if you want this to work in the long term, you will have to eventually spread the recovery over multiple boxes depending on the box size ... yes this does add a little more risk .... but it prevents trashing the account on rough swings and "box volatility" .... that is my results from backtesting since 2009 with a mathematically correct approach.

Cheers,

Sq, check this:

First off, I hope everyone is enjoying their Memorial day weekend with your family or friends. As this thread has progressed over the past month and a half, I have to thank everyone who has contributed, no matter how big or small, and hope the thread continues to thrive and develop. I know by now, with all the chart examples and results, that everyone should have a solid grasp of the concept of the strategy and it's fundamentals and I encourage all of you to not limit yourself to the basic  strategy itself, but to try and improve upon what has been posted to make it better. I will, regrettably, not be posting any more results and charts as it is very time consuming and I am going to have to limit my time on this thread as I need to devote more time into my other project (yes, it's another martingale type strategy) designed for long term trading. I will stop in to answer questions on occasion, but if I'm not online and you need to ask a question, feel free to pm me as well. Hopefully, everyone can join me on the new thread once everything has been finalized.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Might I ask which one or is it top secret at this point?

EDIT:  Oh, and thanks for putting in all the effort.  Interesting concept and I hope SQ. and others can make it better pro-grammatically!  I wish I could stay up all night..

--- 帖子 #865 ---
No, not top secret, just something I stumbled on while revisiting some old daily strategies. I would rather wait until I've kinda fine tuned the settings a little more. I've always like trading strategies that use higher timeframes and this one will also allow us to take advantage of the swaps for each pair as well, I think you'll like it.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Mer,

Thanks for having starting this thread, and good luck for your new project.

We'll see how the strat will perform in the future, and try to fine-tune the settings and the mart factors.

I guess everyone will have his own settings that he likes best, probably different for each pair.

You guys are welcome posting your findings here.

Suggestions for improvements are also welcome of course.

Mer, drop us a line here when you are releasing your new project.

Hi xmph,

Thanks for the "reminder" on your very interesting post.

Indeed the moving box size WILL hurt you badly one day when using hard-coded martingale sequence.

This is why i use a FIXED box size.

Thanks to the "MinExtentInPips" and "MaxExtentInPips" inputs i added: set them identical, and you have a fixed box size.

This way you have control over the amount of lots every day.

Also, the RR ratio is against us with Mer's setttings: first settings of 0.3/1.3: gets you RR=1.0/1.3=0.77 only; newer settings gives RR=1.618/1.8=0.89.

Still not very "sexy".

I use settings that gives me a RR=3/1, much better, and giving a much softer Mart sequence.

At the cost of a lower win/loss chance.

And the win/loss probability is also a big factor in the result of the Martingale, as it directly drives the number of consecutive losses you are facing, and therefore the Martingale factor you will reach.

RR=3 gives k(n) = (1.33)^n:

=> { 1, 1.3, 1.8, 2.4, 3.2, 4.2, 5.6, 7.5, 10, 13.3, ... }

RR=1 gives k(n) = 2^n:    { 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, ... }

So, after 8 losses i get a factor of 10 "only".

Mer's sequence is already topped at 4181...

We could add a "maxAutoMartFactor" input to prevent too large amounts.

Recouping losses over more than 1 trade would be interesting too.

Keeping the last mart factor even after a win could help achieving that.

But it raises the risk too.

And we need to have a good win/loss chance to avoid sequences with a loss-after-1win, which would make things even worth...

In the end, this is all about cooking the right recipe...

lotsToTrade  = f (Win/loss prob , RR , Mart sequence, maxRisk);

Or something like that.

Sq

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Hi Squalou,

may I ask what settings U use?

O.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Here is what i use:

EntryFactor=0.5

TPFactor=5.1

MinExtentInPips=12

MaxExtentInPips=12

This gives me a fixed TP of 55 pips and SL=18p, everyday.

Having only 18p SL is quite narrow, though, leading to more loss-trades, and therefore make the Mart index raise more quickly.

That's why keeping a low Mart Factor is essential.

I get 35~40% win trades only, depending on the pairs, which is not very nice... but as long i stay above 35%, it is in profit in the end:

This also depends if i'm using the HalfClose option, and Trailing stop.

A filter to avoid entering in counter-trend (retracement to the box area) would probably help increase the win/loss ratio.

A trailing stop "after profit only" would also help -- the current trailing stop implementation kicks-in immediately, which gives bad results, choking trades too quickly.

It has even worth results with autoMart, making it not recoup all past consecutive losses, when a trades closes with very small profit due to the trailing stop (then the autoMart takes this as a win, and restarts at factor 1).

Ideas are welcome here!

For those who are wanting to keep the 1:1 RR, you can combine the original settings with the new which will give you an earlier entry but your TP will still equal your stop. I was going to look into testing .3 for my entry with a TP of 1.618.

Understand though, it can be a double edged sword. Sure you can get in earlier but are susceptible to more losses because the Stoploss will be inherently shorter, but on the other hand, you have a better chance of hitting TPs because price doesn't have to go as far. Last nights Eur/Jpy was a perfect example. With the updated settings I was last posting charts for, we would still have 1 open trade, but combining the original settings with those settings we would have had two entries hitting target for +136 pips. As you can also see, the TP has dropped from +94 pips in pic 1 to +68 pips in pic 2, again because your entry point is now closer to your initial stoploss thus shortening your TP but still gets you a 1:1 RR. Remember, this could go the other way as well, so best to play around and test it out.

hello @ mer071898,

In you last post, on the  gb/uchf chart you osted yesterday...i can see u use V7 but mine is different on my chart though i use v9.1 but the air says no trade so lease how do i adjust mine to have same result like yours?

secondly, the new EA adjusted by sauaolu, is not attaching to my chart each time i try ti insert it on the chart. lease help

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Cool ea thanks

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Remember to make sure your times are correct. If not, adjust your times so they match my chart. If so, check what your "MaxBoxSizeInPips" parameter is, mine is set to 90 on Gbp/Chf due to the high volatility and larger daily range. My EntryFactor is .8 and my TPFactor is 2.618, make sure those are correct also.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
thanks mer071898, i'll apply those changes and see how it goes

Big Moves on chart started just before the NFP tonight...

Is there anyone here can figure out this system for an NFP breakout?

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I have an Idea for this system.

After studying the result that Mer's post in this thread, I could see that the Filter Range area is the most profitable area in this system. I think we are wasting too many green pips in the filter area.

So I why dont we decrease the Filter area and take the space from filter area and put it behind the Target Profit.

Please study this picture below.

Attached Image

My setting in this picture

Entry factor = 0.1, TP factor = 1.3

With the current setting, the trade above is a losing one but with the porposed setting we still have a winner one (win by 5 pips). So with this setup we simply turn a losing scenario into a winning one.

I havent test the EA with strategy tester. The EA provided by Squalou might come in handy to figure out the optimum TP factor to maximize the profit from this scenario.

Well this might be just another silly idea from me. But less scenario for losing trades always a good idea

--- 帖子 #880 ---
can someone explain what is meant by Entry Factor and TP Factor ? how they relate to box hi/lo ?

also what are the best 5 pairs for this system and their Entry/TP Factors, box sizes

thanks

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Well, nice idea but if you do a manual backtest for a longer period, you'll observe that it doesn't always get profitable that way.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Thanks Mer for sharing this wonderful trading system. I also thank as many people that have contributed to this tread one way or the other. May the pips be with you all.

Mer, I've downloaded the zipped file in post 1 and the template is missing.

Can you (Mer) or anybody with a template pls share one with me.

Thank you.

what are the best 5 pairs for this system and their Entry/TP Factors, box sizes.

i have downloaded v9, i am seeing green color between entry and profit for USDCHF and purple color for GBPCHF. why is that ?

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Thanks squalou for the latest EA.

The EA is not trading if pip range is more than 50pips even if the max pip is adjusted to > 50pips in the indicator.

Is there anyway to still allow the EA to trade if pips is > 50?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
hi,

you probably have different chart background colors.

just use white (F8 to change the chart color scheme).

IMO the best pairs are GU and GJ, but for factors you'll have to experiment and backtest yourself.

It's not just a load-it-run-it-and-forget-it kind of EA... no EA is like that anyway!

Mer has posted a number of charts with results for various pairs every day, please take the time to go thru the charts and see it you feel confortable with one or the other.

sq

--- 帖子 #886 ---
i guess settings have to be adjusted every now and then, for each pair differently.

Some periods are profitable, others will not, and then become profitable again.

No magic do-it-all settings here.

sq.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
agree with you and this kind of adjustment (higher probability settings) can be achieved easily with EA optimization

--- 帖子 #888 ---
You are talking about EA to the right person there LuckySword....

Squalou... How's everything?

--- 帖子 #889 ---
For those who might be interested, here is a version of the Indicator (v9.2) that will show halfTP levels,

and can be configured to show no levels at all (only breakout box and green "playground").

- "drawFibLines" input(default true): set to false so prevent drawing "fib" lines with entry/stop/target information (only boxes)

Enjoy.

Hi Squalou, thanks for the new version.

Can i asked for a help? How to set the price on H1 to be appear the same

in M5, M15 & M30 TF? I noticed that on TF M5 to M30 the price is the same but on H1 it's diffrent.

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
this is because the endtime bar (08:00) is INCLUDED in the box.

On M15, this means the box will include price action from 08:00 to 08:14:59.

On H1, it will include price from 08:00 to 08:59:59.

Price from 08:15 till 08:59 may reach higher or lower values than before 08:15, so the box will not have the same size than on M15.

You can see that in the box size displayed.

To have the same box on M15 and H1, you need to specify endTime=08:59, so it will include price until 08:59:59 in any TF.

this is general info .. put 99 weeks => we get best boxes at 4 hours; 10hours; 22hours  ...(edit)GMT

best days thursday and friday... coz we got large difference between lower and upper shadow => meaning one way breakout.. if i dont get it wrong

in that way we trade ONLY precise days with boxes at a different time depending on day...

just check other pairs maybe we found something extreme...

=> i will put tomorrow my excel analysis from Jan to Jul based on best days and time to trade with breakouts of more than 50pips... however i didnt include US breakout...

if someone wants to help me with other pairs please feel free to post here...

Hi guys, been doing some trading with this system & here are some thoughts :-

1. Trade filter = can we get the EA to recognise support/resistance lines ? eg we draw our lines & if they fall within the profit zone either a trade isn't taken or the profit target is adjusted to reflect the S/R provided it isn't less than a nominated % of target.

2. Win trades = Personally I would like a pair to stop trading after a win - don't want to be in the market more than i have to ! I can do this manually but be nice to have the option on the EA.

3. Pattern recognition = it does seem pairs go thru periods of poor/good performance - I noticed this particularly on pairs like EUR/GBP & EUR/CHF. Can the EA track winning session performance & choose pairs accordingly ? eg check last 20/10/5 sessions & if win rate not > 60% etc = no trade.

4. Trade entry = I have been experimenting with renko charts for this strategy & wait for a close of a bar past entry line (seems to work ok - can't really do this with 5 or 15 min charts as the move is often done within that bar) - can the EA have this as an option ? Also, noticed when I had set max trades to 2 that pending orders were being immediately cancelled (trading finished for the day) - is the EA taking pending orders as trades ?

I like the system & would like to continue researching/optimising - squalou - would be grateful if you could look at the above.

ok the setup posted here worked quite good this week..

on the contrary the mataf stuff is too large and hard to interpret..

bonus: i noticed highly profitable box time on gbpusd

GMT+2 !!! [08:55-09:00]

buffer 10-15 pips (not optimized)

time to close 22

target 100-150 (not optimized)

trail = 50 (not optimized)

sl opposite side

do not delete opposite orders..

if u can test it dont forget to take summer/winter time change..

yes, because i followed on a GMT+2 broker...

now i will filter which are the best days => as posted for eurusd..

as we add up new data every week = we optimize our entry times every week..

i need people to make same table for at least other 6 pairs

Hello,

First, thanks for all the work and good ideas inhere!

I've read part of the thread and installed the EA V4 (in expert) that I found at the bottom of #1  together with the indicators (in scripts).

I get the same message/error as Xicecube describes in this thread: "The robot has been suspended. Reason: some indicator settings are missing. Please verify objPrefix in the Indicator and the EA (objPrefix is currently set to LB- in the EA).

I checked both the indicator and the EA and saw in both of them the objPrefix set to LB-.

What do I need to do more to get this going?

Regards,

Ben

I have been using the London Breakout  EA-V4.0 for 4 weeks now and its going well. What I would like to do is  alter the Buy & Sell entry levels, and alter the HalfTP & TP fib  levels. I would like to enter at breakout of box and take half profit  at 127 Fib level and full take profit at 138 fib level, with SL staying  as is.

Sorry I know this may be off the subject, but have found the profits   small but constant at the 127 fib level with an entry at break of box   and would like the ea to do this for me.

My question is how do I and can I make these alterations to your London  Breakout EA-V4.0 ? I have the London BreakoutV9.2 indicator & the  London Breakout scriptV3.1 running with the ea.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Hi,

The problem I described (see quoted message) is solved!

Regards,

Ben

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hello,

"BreakEvenPips"- when "BreakEvenPips" is >0, SL is moved to   BE+"BreakEvenProfitInPips" when price has reached BE+"BreakEvenPips".  Works independently from "AllowHalfClose" option (but uses the same   BreakEvenProfitInPips value); Will also be trailed if TrailingStop is  selected; (inspired from Steve's MPTM EA...)

According to the above (found in first message of this thread),

I can leave BreakevenPips at 0 and SL will stay as planned. What I saw is that keeping it at 0, the stoploss was moved to BE+0Pips.

Maybe I did set wrong something else?

Or, should I simply set the "BreakEvenPips" to minus 15 (-15)?

I hope someone is able to answer this for me,

Thanks in advance!

Ben

CHF

EUR

GBP

Am I missing anything?

Thanks!

This works fine but the program gives an error message.
He gives an alarm with: order send failed. The EA does not place any orders.
He does this with any forex pair. I have tried everything but nothing works.

Hello everyone!

I'm a newbie here in FF, but I've been trading forex since two years. Still yet looking for a profitable system in longterm trading. Finally I think I've found something similar to "Simple London Breakout". I was trying to use EA posted in this thread. However I'v spotted few disadvantages during working that EA. Could anyone please answer my questions:Does EA open only pending orders? Is there possibility to open orders by market price? For example it is hard to place pending order 3 pips from open level (not every broker allows that). Don't know why, but function "MaxRisk" doesn't work for me. I put MinLot size 0.2 and MaxRisk 5%. EA opens orders with 0.2 lot. I know I have larger account so that 5% risk would be much bigger. Does anyone know how to solve that problem? Have anyone had such problem (I couldn't found that on this forum)? If someone could answer my questions, I would really appreciate.

Regards and all the best for all of you forex fellow traders!

Excellent result Merlintrade, can you disclosed the rules you are using for the trades so far. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
So, you take an arbitrary box, which is not even the Tokyo range (you only applied 4hrs) and then apply a fib to it and then apply an arbitrary 15pip gap before the trade is entered.

Also, despite the above, why is your stop the other side of the box - if it was a breakout then the stop should be just inside the box also therefore improving the RR to about 1:2

BTW : Freddy : I asked Squalou if there is any chance to have another settings option of an "normal" SL in pips in LBOEAV6.0.

I said him that if, after entry, PA are " stalling" : better to have an short SL in pips, at 10/15/20 pips to cut drastically bad trades, not to wait an hypotetical retracement and to finish with a beautiful loosing trade in most of cases.

More bad trades ? Yes ! But small one for better profit. Your opinion ?

V7.0 version of the EA...

You are not dreaming...

Almost a year after the last posted V6.0 version, and after having moved to the "3 Tier" EA, i am giving you a new version of this EA...

The reason is a request from Bert505 to add "SL pips" in the EA.

The EA was setting the SL to the box extent, which is too far away in many occasions, where you would manually close the trade long before it hits the opposite box edge.

So, here a version that will allow you to set your SL in pips ("SLpips" input) or as a Factor of the box size ("SLFactor" input).

SLFactor works like TPFactor, and is set to 1.0 as default (this will work as the V6.0 EA);

When "SLpips" is >0, then the SL is set to this fix amount and SLFactor is ignored;

otherwise, SL is a factor of the box size indicated by SLFactor;

This version will also allow you to set your session parameters directly from the EA rather than importing them from the Indicator.

This is something i had sleeping in my drawer since... june last year when i shifted to the "3 Tier" LBO EA!

I added a true/false input to select which mode you want:

- ImportFromIndicator": if true, then session parameters are imported from the Indicator (as before, requires the Indicator to be running),

if false, then you can set all the session parameters manually directly in the EA, rather than importing them from Global Variables set by the Indicator:
- StartTime,

- EndTime,

- SessionEndTime,

- MaxBoxSizeInPips,

- EntryFactor,

- TPFactor,

- SLpips,

- SLFactor,

- LevelsResizeFactor,

- MinExtentInPips,

- MaxExtentInPips

I hope you will be happy with these additions!

Have a nice week-end...

Squalou.

Hi Squalou,

where is the different between V7.0 and  "3 Tier EA"?

regards mtbf40

--- 帖子 #933 ---
What i can remember from the top of my head:

- LBO v7.0 EA uses pending orders, 3 Tier EA sends market orders;

- LBO sends only 1 pending order per direction, where 3Tier will send up to 5 market orders with 5 different TP levels; although LBO has a AllowHalfClose option, so you can see this as equivalent to having 2 orders with 2 TP levels;

- entry price is different: LBO has a "EntryFactor", where 3Tier enters at box edges (adjustable by LevelsResizeFactor);

- 3Tier: lot sizes (martingaling) on the next day depend if there are still open trades from previous sessions or if all were closed;

Sq

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Hi mtbf40

LBOV7.0 as LBO V6.1 work with an indi London Breakoutv9.2. 3Tier work alone

LBOv7.0 as LBOV6.1 as two "step" half closing and full. 3Tier have at least 5 levels

(Both have martinguale but for my part I run away from that)

But the main difference is that you can make in LBOV6.1/7.0 a "channel" between the box levels and real entry to avoid spike and so. In 3 Tier you go direct on fire.

As I saw testing the 2 "systems" is that LBOV6.1/7.0 is much more secure than 3Tier. Perhaps Mer has different feelings

Well wrting this I saw that Squalou has already answer : I leave my comment.

Merci Squalou : la je te dois un coup de cidre !

(EDIT: those who have loaded v7.1 should load v7.2 here instead... lotsize and open price was not right on market orders... )

Ok, i wasn't quite waterproof when i wrote that v7.0 SL_pips addition...

V7.2 version of the EA...

Here is a fixed version that i run thru the backtester ( with horrible week-end spread of... 15pips!!! WHY do these brokerz apply crazy spreads during the week-end ??? and WHY does MT4 not allow to specify the spread manually for backtesting ???  )

Let's see if that one will work properly in normal market conditions...

Ok, here goes:

V7.1: [Squalou]: (2011.03.26)

- the EA will open MARKET ORDER when price is too close to the pending entry price;

in that condition, no pending entry was opened, and therefore no trade was triggered;

- Added "Slippage" input in pips (it was 0);

Slippage is also used to check if we can open a market order when price is too close for opening pending orders;

- FIXED SL_pips bug in V7.0: SL_pips input wasn't used properly;

Has anyone got any concrete results for this method. The work on the EA and indicators looks impressive but results so far dont look that impressive however I havent tracked it for long.

Thanks in advance

Splurge

--- 帖子 #944 ---
I have a few criticisms of the initial parameters for this strategy. The size of the box has not been addressed properly. The placing of the box in time seems arbitrary. Currency pairs vary widely in ATR (average true range) and not only that, a currency pair can become extremely volatile (trending strongly), or extremely stable (ranging). I find it difficult to come to terms with "don't trade if the box is over 40 - 50 pips". For example, if the box was 40 pips for EUR/GBP that would be a different trading risk to GBP/USD, which has twice the range.

A wise trader would at least draw a few trend lines and look at some support and resistance levels. What if the box is within the last few days trading range? (Not usually good) What if the box height is very small compared with the average? (Usually good).

The very mention of a martingale strategy send shivers through me as it goes against money management principles and could lead to a margin call very quickly. Really, a martingale approach is an admission of a consistently poor strategy.

All in all an interesting thread and potentially a very profitable strategy, but like the author states on many occasions, should be tested and adapted as required before applying any risk.

I should add that the foregoing is only my opinion, based on my personal trading experience of this type of break out. I have not tried this strategy or the EA and I believe that this type of strategy can be very profitable.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
I follow a number of strategies that do not conform to trading the 'open' so to speak although again I am following a number of them to hopefully come across one that works for me.

I presume some people on here have been successful with this approach otherwise I cannot believe all this work would have been done to achieve nothing. I am hoping someone will come forward to share their experiences and preferred adaptions to this approach.

Thanks Again

You need to find out which is an indicator and which is an EA.

I assume that you know where the indicators go and where the EAs go.

London Breakout EA V6.0 (LBOEAV6.0) is an EA to be installed in the Expert folder. This Ea works with an indi to be put in Indicator folder : London BreakoutV9.2. LBOV6.2 cant work without this indi. The settings are in both indi and EA

London Breakout EAV7.2 can be used with indi London Breakout V9.2.

Or without : then settings have to be put inside EA. But you need to have the indi it to visualize the box and the levels. (If you didn't get it post questions : I"ll try to answer)

LBOEAV7.2 has also a new setting I asked to Squalou : a SL. For the moment I haven't find the right figure for these new set. I came back to the "normal" SL (other side of the box). When I get more time I will test a hard SL of 15 pips : when cur is stalling better to cut early than to go in the wall on the other side of the box...

For the momen market is a bit crazy on all curs... !

Good trading

Is it possible to get a sound alert when the price breaks the box?

Hi Squalou,

Great job on the ea i have been trying it out today for the first time (since i am new to this thread) and its given some good results.

this might be me or not but when I set the BE the ea moves it to it, and then immediately it moves it back the original SL, there might be something wrong with the coding or something. but then it might be something I am doing wrong.

regards

JTH

p.s.

i am using the latest vesion 7.2

Simple london breakout

Hi good day. mer did you help me with this EA, I am open a real account with alpari usa, but the mt4 show me this error

**the robot has been suspended reason: you need to change the magic number input**

Did you change the m n and try again?

Hello, do you have a manual for this EA?

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Hello all,

please bear with me while I introduce myself.

I'm new (ish) to forex factory but not to FX. I also trade a simple London breakout albeit on a different timeframe and from the 8am candle close. I trade on a manual basis and return on average 9.1% (this year).

I trade (almost) exclusively GBP/USD, but want to expand on this to maybe a couple of other pairs.

I stumbled across this thread because I was considering producing an EA based on my strategy, but now I am thinking why should I re-invent the wheel, especially as I have no programming background.

I will be spending the day playing about with this and will no doubt post a couple of questions but in the meantime I would like to thank everyone involved in it's development.

One thing I would like to ask now is regarding the Money management. I usually have a maximum risk of 1% and I notice that there is a 'max risk' input on the EA (2nd entry from the top). Is this entry to place a % risk based on the account balance?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #958 ---
well not off to the best of starts. no smiley face. Do I need to input a magic number?

Hello,

i've been "playing" with tihis indicator. Great job. Must confess i'm not very fond of multiplying lots to cover losses...But each to its own.

Following the indicator i went for the "sell"entry" at the low of the asian box with 0.1 lots. The trailing stop got me though for a nice pip profit

good thread.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
still getting this error and cant run the EA yet, could anyone advice about it?

Error Says:

The robot has been suspended. Reason: Some Indicator SETTINGS are missing;

Please verify objPrefix in the Indicator and the EA

(objPrefix is currently set to LB- in the EA)

--- 帖子 #969 ---
OK so first day of live trading using v 4 of the EA as I'm happy for it to take levels from the indicator and neither am I using Martingale so V 4 is fine. I havent had this problem before today.

Everything going fine, orders filled, 2 winners and one loser but thats ok because I'm using 1:1 RR. However, once each order was closed out I was obviously expecting new pending orders to be filled. But, suddenly my smiley face dissapears, replaced by x, no new pending orders, have missed out on maybe 80 pips in 20 minutes. It was almost as if the EA was behaving more like a script. So I have tried putting on V 7.2. But the same result, no smiley face. Incredibly frustrating watching my pips dissipate right in front of me.

I have the EA set to no more than 2 losses per pair per day. OCO is set to false.

My broker is Alpari, whether that makes any difference I dont know. Does anyone have any ideas why the EA de-activated during the session?

(now standing at 138 pips not traded)

--- 帖子 #970 ---
If you are using V 4 of the EA then you will also need to put the LB V9.1 (or 9.2) on your chart so that the EA can import the entry and exit points for each trade.

If you are using V 7.2 of the EA then it doesn't need the LB indicator but you will need to specify the enrty and profit factors on the 'inputs' tab

--- 帖子 #971 ---
OK,

so a few hours ago i posted about the EA suddenly not working. So I downloaded a new MT4 Demo account, set everythng up and hey presto the EA is working on the new account but still not working on my Alpari account or my FXCM demo account.

Any ideas anybody?

HI, I'm new to this trading method and I find it quite interesting, so thank for all your work hard.

But I have a little problem of the indicator setting, it's about the time range of the red box (sr that I can't read all of the posts it's over 100 pages so I don't know its name), the red box finishes right before London session begins, right? So, it starts at 3.00 GMT and closes at 6:00 GMT ??? That's what I'm confusing.

Sorry for a stupid question but any kind-heart willing to help me!

Thanks so much!

Hello squalou,

Very good EA but I'm a small pb with !

I just want to open 1 position per day (buy ou sell) after the 2 pending orders appear at the beginning of a session.

So I want that when the trade is open (for exemple a buy position) the EA close the opposite pending sell order and wait for the next day.

After change the "MaxTradesAllowedForTheDay" to 1 or 2 and "OneCancelsTheOther" to true, the EA seems to bug (no trade is open and many bad pending orders appear).

Can you solve that or tell me how to do if I only want open 1 position per day ?

Thx.

In an EA only 0.02 lot.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
No, but the title reads 2013. Given all the recent mql4 changes, I doubt that the EA would work beyond MT4 Build 509 or 574.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
yes i have build 611. when i drag the EA into the chart nothing happen.

any working EA for a LO ?

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
You might getting in touch with Silicus and/or DeMark2223in this thread. I recommended some very minor code edits to another London Breakout EA that may have worked. Personally, I'm staying with Build 509 for a while.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Is there any update for this strategy/indicator??

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I have been trying to make it work in manual backtesting, but it does not seem to be good. Maybe the market changed.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Hello. I am very new to MT4 and dont understand how to set things up correct to use this EA in the Strategy backtester of MT4. I want to trade this system manually but with support of the indicator / EA. Backtesting several Currencycrosses and keep monitoring their results would help me optimizing the Strategy slightly over time and selecting the right currency crosses. Thanks for your help!

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
Hi guys Just download the indicator last friday. It seems very good and i'm excited to test it with boxes no bigger than 40. Just would like to know what risk reward you guys taking since it doesn't seem to be even 1:1

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
hi guys. I came across this thread. can someone working version EA + script and indi please?

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
No EA needed. London breakout is really straight forward. Trade all GBP pairs 2-3hrs into London session on 1H chart. Buy 30 pip at high break of 8am or 9amGMT candle and sell 30pips at low break of candle every day. Orders 5 pips grace each way and stops placed opposite ends of the chosen candle. Over 70% win simple strategy for compounding.

The breakout is rarely immediate and majority of the high or low for the day in GMT time can be found between 7am and 10am to which the market has usually stopped tormenting traders and has found its direction.

So to be clear place orders at 8am or 9am or place orders on both.Set and forget.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
I'm getting errors: "too many initializers" and "function must return a value" ....from Breakout EA?

any idea?

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Thanks for this. Do you mean place buy stop/sell stop above/below the high/low breaks? Also,where or how do you put your stoploss and take profit? Do you use trailing stop? 70% win rate is good enough.Regards,Mary.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Hi, I found this post , and I am wondering if you can help me figure out how to optimize a breakout strategy on GU using an Asian box 23.00 GMT to 9 a.m. GMT. Like you mention, SL for he buy stop is the sell stop and vice versa, and I am trying to figure out how to take advantage of the long runs of trend that one can get.  my strategy goes both ways, so on some days where it reverses, one can a good run on the second stop order, which is a sinner, and that can moe than compensate for the loss.

Your strategy sounds like it is a fixed TP of 30 pips, is that correct? Mine is equal to the SL range. Please message me .

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Hello, I am getting  a "zero divide" error with the indicator. How can this be fixed? This applies to one particular index instrument only. All Forex pairs are working fine.

I’ve tested countless of variations of the london breakout approach while strictly focusing on GBP/USD for my tests and so far I haven’t found ONE plan that actually works.

I tried all kind of different parameters and combinations of them. Different time periods to define the breakout range, fixed risk/profit values, trailing stops/profits multiple entries, reversing the signals, time based stops, adding market conditional filters (to filter out for trending vs mean reverting days), directional filters, min/max size of the range, and some more.

I couldn’t find anything even remotely working to show consistent profitable for 3 months, 6 months or even 12 months intervals of sample periods.

It’s all cr@p.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Yes, that was over 10 years ago. I think the markets have changed and it doesn't work that way anymore. At least that reflects my own experience with what I've tested recently. None of this even remotely works.

With all due respect, the statistics don't help me personally. If you have a trading strategy that is relatively simple and requires no discretion, let me know and I will test it out. Everything I find is total useless crap and I'm getting really tired of it.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
What has changed ? the volatility is different from 10 years ago.

You don't see Asian channel > 40 pips so you have to adapt the strategy to trading in lower volatility market.

My GU 2023 statistics shows the best trading hours are the European-London sessions.

Today is a good example when the intraday ADR high got hit and price reverse @RN127500 ...

It's not about the easy days. Most days are NOT like that. Can you post the last 60 days where you applied exactly the same rules? So not having cherry picked a winning example. Forget about meaningless pips too. Risk 1% per trade / 1 trade per day. What are your results?

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
These rules are not really clear rules either. Most of it is very vague and leaves so much room for interpretation. Make it clear so that you can objectively compare the results with each other

1. London Market Trading - GBP/USD - 15 Minute Chart - clear.

2. Print out News Calendar - No trades 30 minutes before or after news. If your in a trade - either exit or really tighten stop Loss. - clear

3. Use Fractals on your chart to visually see and measure swings. - clear (don't need)

4. Put Tokyo Channel on your Charts - - - 40+ pip spread hi/lo minimum before trading. *** Very Important. - clear

5. Swings should average 20 to 40 pips or more. - unclear

6. Enter on second candle using top/bottom of first candle for entry level. Use Buy stop or Sell Stop orders. - what candle? what is the exact entry trigger to buy/sell?

7. Exit on big numbers of 00 or 10 or 20 or 35 or 50 or 65 or 80 or 90. These numbers are your target levels. - 8 different exit points - very unclear.

8. Lost Trade - Re-enter on the next swing doubling your lot size. If second trade loses go back to normal lot size. Swings average 20 to 40 pips on 15 minute time frame. On other time frames the swing size will be different. - what "swing"? - very unclear again, what is the entry criteria for the 2. trade a day.

London trading is not an opportunity every day, about 1-2 times a week, taking EUEUSD as an example, fluctuating 150-200 points a week. The rest of the time it is a volatile market, and if you still trade London rules, you will lose money. You can't just rely on London time, you have to look at the cycle bigger, H4,D1. If you find a new opportunity in the market, then in the London time of the day, accurately enter, then you can make a profit on the day. I have studied the London period for more than two years, and this can only be used as a means of admission, and there must be a trading system to cooperate. Under the guidance of a medium - and long-term direction, the London time period is used to enter, increase and reduce positions

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
I have always used EURUSD as the direct index, today did not rise, but the GBPUSD rose, I think there is no strength, because the GBPUSD will follow the footsteps of EURUSD. Later,EURUSD fell,  I enter and an hour later, the GBPUSD broke through and began to fall, and I immediately entered GBPUSD the short order. This is how I made my order in London today
